00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.220
<v Speaker 1>the lead singer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest rock bands of all </v>

26
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.321
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

27
00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:24.441
<v Speaker 1>him to be so fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people point to he was very </v>

28
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>sexually abused when he was a young kid </v>

<v Speaker 1>most gentle,</v>

37
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.080

00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 1>It's just all giant ranches and some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them are like 10,000</v>

120
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:18.421
<v Speaker 1>plus acres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like twenty thousand one hundred </v>

121
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:21.110
<v Speaker 1>thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could camp there I guess </v>

122
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.110
<v Speaker 1>because it takes you like three hours to</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive across it.</v>

123
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had drove to your house.</v>

124
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:24.870
<v Speaker 1>That's too much land too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

125
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>It's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you need that much land?</v>

126
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.920
<v Speaker 1>How about Ted Turner?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that guy owns the most land of </v>

127
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.071
<v Speaker 1>anybody in the country here today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>King ranch sprawls 825,000</v>

128
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:41.011
<v Speaker 1>acres of South Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Land an area larger than the state of </v>

129
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Rhode Island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>

130
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the home of 35,000</v>

131
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.750
<v Speaker 1>cattle and over 200 quarter horses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>king ranch,</v>

132
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.890
<v Speaker 1>one of the largest ranches in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

133
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.110
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they hunt on that ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

134
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Which king?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some fucking baller.</v>

135
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 1>He might as well be a case King of Rhode</v>
<v Speaker 1>Island.</v>

136
00:05:57.861 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Burger King.</v>

137
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a burger king guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't sane man.</v>

138
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 2>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No gay bars.</v>

139
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 2>I get this three or four in there for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

140
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 2>It would be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No gay bars,</v>

141
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:16.211
<v Speaker 2>but there's plenty of truck stops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rest stops are like where they're at </v>

142
00:06:16.211 --> 00:06:20.110
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't really gotten to the full </v>

143
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.110
<v Speaker 2>on gay bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not full admittance.</v>

144
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 2>They just wanted to meet at the rest </v>
<v Speaker 2>stops when we were kids.</v>

145
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.910
<v Speaker 2>That was like the thing like you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>always know.</v>

146
00:06:23.911 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 2>The dudes would try to bang dudes at </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrest a hundred percent.</v>

147
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're at a rest stop and </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone knocks on your door and it's a </v>

148
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.320
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's looking to get a blow job.</v>

149
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 2>Just no rest there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's resting.</v>

150
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.020
<v Speaker 2>You're wide awake and in your mouth they</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out to meet at rest up.</v>

151
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:46.340

157
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:14.170
<v Speaker 2>The gentleman who got arrested in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sting operation because so many dudes </v>

177
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.591
<v Speaker 2>conduct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said I should have had the advice of </v>

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:11.840
<v Speaker 2>counsel and resolving this matter in </v>
<v Speaker 2>hindsight,</v>

179
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:16.841
<v Speaker 2>I should not have pled guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to handle this matter </v>

180
00:08:16.841 --> 00:08:20.441
<v Speaker 2>myself quickly and expeditiously get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I travel wearing tap shoes.</v>

181
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of me thinks it's hilarious,</v>

182
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:28.090
<v Speaker 2>but part of me is sad that this guy has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to like hide what he's into and he has </v>

183
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:33.071
<v Speaker 2>to hide in bathroom stalls and learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>some fucking secret tap and just smell </v>

184
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 2>farts from around the world as he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming.</v>

185
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 2>According to the report cited by roll </v>
<v Speaker 2>call,</v>

186
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Craig tapped his right foot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the officer said he recognized as </v>

187
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.350
<v Speaker 2>a signal used by persons wishing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>engage in lewd conduct.</v>

188
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 2>But what if you were there and you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>tapping your foot?</v>

189
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you're just impatient because </v>

190
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:52.420
<v Speaker 2>your shit's taking other stuff next.</v>

191
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he also then entered the stall next door</v>

192
00:08:54.381 --> 00:08:56.910
<v Speaker 2>and block the door with his luggage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Gee.</v>

193
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.250
<v Speaker 2>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does P,</v>

194
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.240
<v Speaker 2>other people get in then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

195
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:05.241
<v Speaker 2>I was in there with somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to block anybody from </v>

196
00:09:05.241 --> 00:09:05.241
<v Speaker 2>coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

197
00:09:05.241 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 2>He must've been just going to town on </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys and then airport.</v>

198
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 2>That was the spot and people are kicking</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to kick in the door.</v>

199
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.720
<v Speaker 2>What was happening there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it,</v>

200
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.070
<v Speaker 2>but how does it like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does a spot become notorious?</v>

201
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.020
<v Speaker 2>Like how does arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it say?</v>

202
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 2>Proceeded to swipe his hand under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stall divider several times.</v>

203
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.080
<v Speaker 2>I want to know what the fuck was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cop was saying,</v>

204
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.340
<v Speaker 2>if he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

205
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't Tuck your tick here.</v>

206
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.090
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what the cop was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cop was totally leading him on.</v>

207
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean it sounded like he had the green </v>
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>

208
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:43.040
<v Speaker 2>Unless the guy's a total psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you go into a stall with another </v>

209
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.190
<v Speaker 2>dude and you stack up your luggage in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of the door,</v>

210
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 2>that's a bold move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

211
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.950
<v Speaker 2>It seems like you would only do that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were emboldened.</v>

212
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Didn't just tap his foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He touched the officer's foot with his </v>

213
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.000
<v Speaker 2>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He reached his foot all the way under.</v>

214
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.950
<v Speaker 2>Here's my question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know cops are full of Shit.</v>

215
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.680
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like people.</v>

216
00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:02.660
<v Speaker 3>People full shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put cops are people.</v>

217
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.400
<v Speaker 3>Not all cops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of cops are awesome.</v>

218
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:09.730
<v Speaker 3>We know some cops are full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when when something like this </v>

219
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.791
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's one person versus </v>

220
00:10:12.791 --> 00:10:12.791
<v Speaker 3>another person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really feel like a cop's word is</v>

221
00:10:12.791 --> 00:10:15.680
<v Speaker 3>worth more than a regular person's word </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think a cop was just a regular</v>

222
00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:20.681
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you should listen to them when </v>

223
00:10:20.681 --> 00:10:20.681
<v Speaker 3>they're doing the job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but something like this,</v>

224
00:10:20.681 --> 00:10:22.610
<v Speaker 3>it might've been exactly as this cop </v>
<v Speaker 3>described,</v>

225
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:27.670
<v Speaker 3>but it might've been like that Baltimore</v>
<v Speaker 3>cop that got busted planting drugs with </v>

226
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:31.631
<v Speaker 3>his fucking camera had a body camera on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what he didn't understand is when </v>

227
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:35.741
<v Speaker 3>you turn on a body camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it records 30 seconds before you turned </v>

228
00:10:35.741 --> 00:10:39.461
<v Speaker 3>it on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so just in case you turn it on in a </v>

229
00:10:39.461 --> 00:10:39.461
<v Speaker 3>moment of duress was something crazy is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

230
00:10:39.461 --> 00:10:39.461
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

231
00:10:39.461 --> 00:10:41.840
<v Speaker 3>the camera and you present on vacancy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone committing a crime,</v>

232
00:10:41.841 --> 00:10:45.020
<v Speaker 3>perhaps you have a 32nd buffer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>

233
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.280
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know that either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

234
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.520
<v Speaker 3>So they got on video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 seconds of him going back in planting</v>

235
00:10:51.861 --> 00:10:53.320
<v Speaker 3>the drugs that he then pretended to.</v>

236
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

237
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.360
<v Speaker 2>That's horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horrible.</v>

238
00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.040
<v Speaker 2>Fucking horrifying,</v>

239
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.120
<v Speaker 3>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See?</v>

240
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.830
<v Speaker 3>Because if you're gonna be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>convict somebody on,</v>

241
00:11:03.831 --> 00:11:05.840
<v Speaker 3>this guy says this and that guy says </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

242
00:11:05.841 --> 00:11:10.841
<v Speaker 3>and who do you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe the copies an officer of the </v>

243
00:11:10.841 --> 00:11:12.911
<v Speaker 3>law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy because it's just a person </v>

244
00:11:12.911 --> 00:11:12.911
<v Speaker 3>and this is not a disrespectful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cops.</v>

245
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a disrespectful person,</v>

246
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.250
<v Speaker 3>but the amount of power is a scary </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of power and it's just a person.</v>

247
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:24.430
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people like I have a bunch of </v>

248
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.430
<v Speaker 3>friends are cops and they know how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>handle it.</v>

249
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've handled it and they've,</v>

250
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:25.820
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get it,</v>

251
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:27.950
<v Speaker 3>they know what it is and they're real </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool about it.</v>

252
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.440
<v Speaker 3>Like big John McCarthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ref for the UFC.</v>

253
00:11:30.441 --> 00:11:32.990
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the best examples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big John is a.</v>

254
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:38.050
<v Speaker 3>He was a serious cop in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in some fucking hairy shit for </v>

255
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.651
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the nicest guys you ever want to </v>

256
00:11:41.651 --> 00:11:42.290
<v Speaker 3>meet and totally fair and reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

257
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.320
<v Speaker 3>And he was the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

258
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.690
<v Speaker 3>that was like a bright and shining </v>
<v Speaker 3>example of what a cop could be.</v>

259
00:11:47.691 --> 00:11:51.170
<v Speaker 3>And if the world is filled with big John</v>
<v Speaker 3>McCarthy's as cops,</v>

260
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.460
<v Speaker 3>it'd be a wonderful place and I think we</v>
<v Speaker 3>all figured out,</v>

261
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:55.900
<v Speaker 3>but cops are just people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>

262
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 3>especially when these cops are going </v>
<v Speaker 3>into these situations,</v>

263
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 3>like imagine me in a 21 year old guy or </v>
<v Speaker 3>however the fuck old you are,</v>

264
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.170
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden you're working in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Camden,</v>

265
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:07.870
<v Speaker 3>New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get the fuck Outta here.</v>

266
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.960
<v Speaker 3>You're not ready for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying regular dude and you're </v>

267
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.291
<v Speaker 3>going to get thrust into some chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost semi war zone in some of these </v>

268
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:19.180
<v Speaker 3>bad neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people have to patrol.</v>

269
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:24.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just another world with another set </v>

270
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.731
<v Speaker 3>of rules and just shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just going down and you're coming up on </v>

271
00:12:26.731 --> 00:12:28.450
<v Speaker 3>is most likely a threat to your life.</v>

272
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:33.690
<v Speaker 3>You pull a guy over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you pulled a guy over in a 65 </v>

273
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:37.231
<v Speaker 3>impala.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the odds that guy doesn't have </v>

274
00:12:37.231 --> 00:12:37.231
<v Speaker 3>a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

275
00:12:37.231 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Speaker 3>You see like one of them low rider cars </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you see some,</v>

276
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:43.350
<v Speaker 3>some gangster look and fellows with some</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy face tattoos and shit and they're </v>

277
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.780
<v Speaker 3>driving those cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine having to pull over </v>

278
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.610
<v Speaker 3>someone who you knew was probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to shoot you and you have to </v>

279
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.631
<v Speaker 3>talk to them about their brake light </v>
<v Speaker 3>being off or they were five miles an </v>

280
00:12:54.631 --> 00:12:54.631
<v Speaker 3>hour above the speed limit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

281
00:12:54.631 --> 00:12:56.920
<v Speaker 3>you know the videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've seen videos of cops getting shot.</v>

282
00:12:56.921 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 3>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that that could happen.</v>

283
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.140
<v Speaker 3>You around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People just lying all the time.</v>

284
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.640
<v Speaker 3>They're all lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

285
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.800
<v Speaker 3>How many of them are telling the truth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They talked to you.</v>

286
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Ninety percent fellowship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety percent.</v>

287
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:09.960
<v Speaker 3>So every day it's just true</v>

288
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:15.750
<v Speaker 4>panic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like when I would get pulled </v>

289
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.750
<v Speaker 4>over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like I panicked.</v>

290
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.750
<v Speaker 4>I fucking like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

291
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.110
<v Speaker 3>that cop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shot,</v>

292
00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:21.220
<v Speaker 3>that chick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the recent one where the woman called in</v>

293
00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:22.070
<v Speaker 3>Minnesota.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

294
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.120
<v Speaker 3>She called for the police and then she </v>
<v Speaker 3>came out and when she came out the cops </v>

295
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.581
<v Speaker 3>shot her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That to me is the perfect example of why</v>

296
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:37.380
<v Speaker 3>we should reassess what a cop is and </v>
<v Speaker 3>reassess like how many people get to be </v>

297
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:42.601
<v Speaker 3>cops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an extraordinary responsibility </v>

298
00:13:42.601 --> 00:13:45.250
<v Speaker 3>you're putting on just any person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an ordinary person.</v>

299
00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:50.251
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to be an extraordinary </v>

300
00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:52.000
<v Speaker 3>person to be a good cop for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You also have to deal with the fact that</v>

301
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.340
<v Speaker 3>there's been a lot of bad cops and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of prejudice against cops.</v>

302
00:13:55.341 --> 00:14:00.341
<v Speaker 3>It was like two giant factors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that job where you decide </v>

303
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.520
<v Speaker 3>whether or not you pull the trigger and </v>
<v Speaker 3>end someone's life and you're a </v>

304
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.440
<v Speaker 3>panicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you're a panicker.</v>

305
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.310
<v Speaker 3>You're not a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not a guy who does well in,</v>

306
00:14:08.311 --> 00:14:13.311
<v Speaker 3>in confrontational situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you haven't been in a lot of </v>

307
00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:13.311
<v Speaker 3>conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you've seen too much shit.</v>

308
00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:16.180
<v Speaker 3>Maybe seen too many people get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're suffering from PTSD.</v>

309
00:14:16.181 --> 00:14:18.760
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're on edge all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you have nightmares that someone's</v>

310
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:23.761
<v Speaker 3>going to take you out and then all </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden you're in the hallway and this </v>

311
00:14:23.761 --> 00:14:24.130
<v Speaker 3>lady comes out or an alleyway and shoot </v>
<v Speaker 3>her and you're like,</v>

312
00:14:24.131 --> 00:14:25.260
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you.</v>

313
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.460
<v Speaker 3>You might not even saw her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

314
00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:30.160
<v Speaker 3>people have hallucinations under great </v>
<v Speaker 3>duress,</v>

315
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.870
<v Speaker 3>like when they think their life is on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the line,</v>

316
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.700
<v Speaker 3>they see things that aren't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

317
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.770
<v Speaker 3>It happens to people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll,</v>

318
00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.870
<v Speaker 3>they'll mistake someone for something </v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

319
00:14:37.871 --> 00:14:39.430
<v Speaker 3>The mistake someone for an attacker.</v>

320
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking insane.</v>

321
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:46.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean she called the cops crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's fucking insane to call </v>

322
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:51.341
<v Speaker 4>nine one one because she heard what she </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought was a woman being assaulted and </v>

323
00:14:51.341 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 4>then approach a cop car</v>

324
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.150
<v Speaker 1>and they get fucking shot phrasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like what?</v>

325
00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.480
<v Speaker 1>But it's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is people not handling pressure very </v>

326
00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:01.640
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pressure is,</v>

327
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.700
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is such a massive factor in the way </v>

328
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 1>people behave and there's no bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure than you showing up.</v>

329
00:15:09.981 --> 00:15:13.250
<v Speaker 1>You have bright shiny lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in the enemy car.</v>

330
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were in the NMP enemy uniform and </v>

331
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.371
<v Speaker 1>they know you have a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how many of them have watched so </v>

332
00:15:21.371 --> 00:15:24.971
<v Speaker 1>many videos on tv of cops planting </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence on Youtube of cops planting </v>

333
00:15:24.971 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 1>evidence of kids being shot by cops and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stores were cops got shot in the back.</v>

334
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean like crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're dealing with the weight of </v>

335
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:33.860
<v Speaker 1>that when you step out of your car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

336
00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:35.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four slash seven.</v>

337
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.550
<v Speaker 1>That's a job that is insanely hard to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we should,</v>

338
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.520
<v Speaker 1>we should figure out a way to reengineer</v>
<v Speaker 1>that position.</v>

339
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.460
<v Speaker 1>We should figure out a way to give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>more help,</v>

340
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:51.130
<v Speaker 1>more support and explain like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

341
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:55.940
<v Speaker 1>the only way like cops and civilians are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get along is if there's no fuck</v>

342
00:15:55.941 --> 00:15:58.790
<v Speaker 1>ups or very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few fuck ups.</v>

343
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Like anytime something like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>

344
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.140
<v Speaker 1>you realize you got to realize like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a bad system.</v>

345
00:16:03.141 --> 00:16:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Like the system is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have just a regular person and</v>

346
00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:07.580
<v Speaker 1>give them a gun kind of psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

347
00:16:07.581 --> 00:16:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Do they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen what they're.</v>

348
00:16:09.341 --> 00:16:10.760
<v Speaker 1>What they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did they get the Gig?</v>

349
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:12.320
<v Speaker 1>If you seen what they're like under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun.</v>

350
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen what they're like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone wants to beat their ass?</v>

351
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen what they're like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone is throwing punches at him,</v>

352
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.850
<v Speaker 1>trying to kill them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guy randomly,</v>

353
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:21.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He answers a call.</v>

354
00:16:21.921 --> 00:16:24.680
<v Speaker 1>He opens a door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys throwing bombs at them.</v>

355
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.670
<v Speaker 1>How does he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does he do?</v>

356
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.380
<v Speaker 1>How does he handle this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he shoot the guy?</v>

357
00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:29.240
<v Speaker 1>Does he run away?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you fight back?</v>

358
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Has He ever been punched?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

359
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're asking some regular person to </v>

360
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.910
<v Speaker 1>just be involved in it potential like </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilian warzone on any given day,</v>

361
00:16:37.911 --> 00:16:42.911
<v Speaker 1>like if you're in Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida and someone gunshots fired in a </v>

362
00:16:42.911 --> 00:16:42.911
<v Speaker 1>warehouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

363
00:16:42.911 --> 00:16:47.740
<v Speaker 1>what are the odds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys don't have like piles of </v>

364
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.550
<v Speaker 1>cocaine in his warehouse machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen narchos come on,</v>

365
00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:50.660
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing.</v>

366
00:16:50.661 --> 00:16:52.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like you've never seen a mellow cop</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

367
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.150
<v Speaker 1>There was no like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chill movie where it's like,</v>

368
00:16:56.151 --> 00:16:56.780
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

369
00:16:56.781 --> 00:17:01.781
<v Speaker 1>you got a speeding ticket and then did </v>
<v Speaker 1>today and then the end is fucking nuts </v>

370
00:17:01.781 --> 00:17:04.790
<v Speaker 1>except smoking the bandit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty proven.</v>

371
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Then they drove recklessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do nobody around.</v>

372
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean nobody to hit.</v>

373
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

374
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.550
<v Speaker 1>I have a question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

375
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.410
<v Speaker 1>What is this I hear about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

376
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.360
<v Speaker 1>your dream pills?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pills.</v>

377
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said that you approached your </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain.</v>

378
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:28.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a nootropic what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually nutrients that are </v>

379
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.250
<v Speaker 1>building blocks for human </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurotransmitters,</v>

380
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:35.730
<v Speaker 1>like certain foods that are called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I'm saying foods because you eat </v>

381
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:36.170
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's their supplements,</v>

382
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:41.230
<v Speaker 1>mostly vitamins and minerals and a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of different things that you can get </v>

383
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:44.771
<v Speaker 1>from plants and there's a series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of nootropics and if </v>

384
00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:47.990
<v Speaker 1>you've never looked into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a cool thing to study.</v>

385
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.080
<v Speaker 1>There's actually supplements out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that enhance</v>

386
00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.670
<v Speaker 3>your memory and they enhance your </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction time as well,</v>

387
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:54.420
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

388
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you feel like if you're hung over or</v>

389
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.540
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't even understand what this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

390
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.080
<v Speaker 3>such a man of health never drank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that feeling where you're like kind </v>

391
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.140
<v Speaker 3>of foggy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cut or some days you just kind of.</v>

392
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.250
<v Speaker 3>It's not firing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

393
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:13.370
<v Speaker 3>So we know for sure this is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>obvious to everybody that there's a </v>

394
00:18:13.711 --> 00:18:16.770
<v Speaker 3>difference in your performance based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>a variety of factors,</v>

395
00:18:16.771 --> 00:18:17.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

396
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.740
<v Speaker 3>Lack of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrition,</v>

397
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.270
<v Speaker 3>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stress.</v>

398
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.480
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole host of factors that </v>
<v Speaker 3>affect how your brain forms nootropics.</v>

399
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
<v Speaker 3>What they can do is boost up your </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain's ability to remember things like </v>

400
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.440
<v Speaker 3>verbal memory is a big one that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

401
00:18:34.441 --> 00:18:38.490
<v Speaker 3>And we did two double blind placebo </v>
<v Speaker 3>controlled studies about Alpha brain.</v>

402
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.530
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things we found.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We found,</v>

403
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>memory reaction time and peak alpha flow</v>

404
00:18:44.841 --> 00:18:49.841
<v Speaker 3>state all improvements and all like </v>
<v Speaker 3>statistically significant improvements </v>

405
00:18:49.841 --> 00:18:49.841
<v Speaker 3>in those areas.</v>

406
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.160
<v Speaker 3>So what I've found is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

407
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:57.570
<v Speaker 3>there was a company called neuro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is the supplement.</v>

408
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.570
<v Speaker 3>I forget his company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's Bill Roman,</v>

409
00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.190
<v Speaker 3>you know bill very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

410
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.860
<v Speaker 3>That guy is Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Savage,</v>

411
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.200
<v Speaker 3>savage as a football player,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super savage.</v>

412
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.610
<v Speaker 3>And remember we're going to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the new cte study that just came out.</v>

413
00:19:11.611 --> 00:19:13.800
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy with football players,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

414
00:19:13.801 --> 00:19:18.801
<v Speaker 3>Bill Roman [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>he used to be friends with this dude </v>

415
00:19:18.801 --> 00:19:19.350
<v Speaker 3>Sarah and no name and no name was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

416
00:19:19.351 --> 00:19:21.330
<v Speaker 3>that were cool radio station in San </v>
<v Speaker 3>Francisco.</v>

417
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:26.450
<v Speaker 3>Still love doing them and I'm no name </v>
<v Speaker 3>was friends with Roman asking </v>

418
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.270
<v Speaker 3>romanesque.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was training him.</v>

419
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.370
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like trying to get him in shape.</v>

420
00:19:29.371 --> 00:19:30.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on you fuck,</v>

421
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:35.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to work you out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you put them through a bunch of </v>

422
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.071
<v Speaker 3>brutal workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he gave him some of his </v>

423
00:19:37.071 --> 00:19:37.071
<v Speaker 3>supplement and that's how I found out </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

424
00:19:37.071 --> 00:19:41.180
<v Speaker 3>And to supplement neuro one he invented </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was suffering from head </v>

425
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.930
<v Speaker 3>injuries because he had been so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>concussions,</v>

426
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:47.931
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's having memory problems and all </v>

427
00:19:47.931 --> 00:19:47.931
<v Speaker 3>sorts of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he started looking into um,</v>

428
00:19:47.931 --> 00:19:52.170
<v Speaker 3>nutritional cures like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what helps boost neurotransmitters,</v>

429
00:19:52.171 --> 00:19:53.820
<v Speaker 3>which helps boost serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

430
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:59.080
<v Speaker 3>there's like five htp is a big one that </v>
<v Speaker 3>helps boost serotonin and l trip to fan </v>

431
00:19:59.161 --> 00:20:04.161
<v Speaker 3>as well because El Tryptofan actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>converts to a five htp and then you have</v>

432
00:20:04.201 --> 00:20:09.201
<v Speaker 3>to add in a bunch of other shit like </v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptogens and b vitamins and all these </v>

433
00:20:09.201 --> 00:20:12.951
<v Speaker 3>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a combination that you can </v>

434
00:20:12.951 --> 00:20:12.980
<v Speaker 3>hit of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of nutrients and Bill Romanowski uses.</v>

435
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.540
<v Speaker 3>I think he used a little caffeine in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

436
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.020
<v Speaker 3>Anything to do with him by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not an advertisement.</v>

437
00:20:19.021 --> 00:20:21.330
<v Speaker 3>We don't sell neuro one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the shit.</v>

438
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.010
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

439
00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.450
<v Speaker 3>that's the first thing I found out about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

440
00:20:24.451 --> 00:20:27.660
<v Speaker 3>found out about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we wound up making Alpha brain,</v>

441
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:32.690
<v Speaker 3>which is our version of it with a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 3>of things at work together </v>

442
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.690
<v Speaker 3>synergistically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

443
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:37.050
<v Speaker 3>if you take that stuff before bedtime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times you get freaky dreams.</v>

444
00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.420
<v Speaker 3>Like if you take it like an hour before </v>
<v Speaker 3>bedtime,</v>

445
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.190
<v Speaker 3>like right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to like,</v>

446
00:20:41.191 --> 00:20:43.520
<v Speaker 3>right when you go to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

447
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.600
<v Speaker 3>that's when it's just getting into your </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

448
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.220
<v Speaker 3>And I guess when you go into your rem</v>

449
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.340
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get an extra fucking fat,</v>

450
00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:56.341
<v Speaker 2>juicy pipe of neurotransmitters to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you started having freaky ass </v>

451
00:20:56.341 --> 00:20:57.580
<v Speaker 2>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this full inception.</v>

452
00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a Paratha.</v>

453
00:21:00.521 --> 00:21:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Tim is really good too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People love that stuff.</v>

454
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coleen Coleen is a big one.</v>

455
00:21:06.221 --> 00:21:09.620
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the ingredients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lucky charms.</v>

456
00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:12.190
<v Speaker 2>I definitely am lucky charm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should be.</v>

457
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:15.040
<v Speaker 2>People will be like times made me very </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart today.</v>

458
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:16.630
<v Speaker 2>They're basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

459
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.130
<v Speaker 2>their nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

460
00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:18.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a trip.</v>

461
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just super skeptical about this.</v>

462
00:21:21.521 --> 00:21:23.470
<v Speaker 2>And you definitely should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You definitely should be.</v>

463
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.920
<v Speaker 2>I would never ever in a million years </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to sell someone something that </v>

464
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.670
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have zero desire and doing that.</v>

465
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.060
<v Speaker 2>So everything that we do it on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use.</v>

466
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use I or I believe in it.</v>

467
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no horseshit thing,</v>

468
00:21:38.261 --> 00:21:40.090
<v Speaker 2>so when this whole new tropics thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>came out,</v>

469
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:45.480
<v Speaker 2>we like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we rushed and Got Alpha brain out and a </v>

470
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:45.480
<v Speaker 2>lot of people call bullshit.</v>

471
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:45.480
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

472
00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.680
<v Speaker 2>there's no studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No science is a snake oil.</v>

473
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.430
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

474
00:21:48.431 --> 00:21:50.440
<v Speaker 2>you got to have like all your ducks in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>row.</v>

475
00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:55.780
<v Speaker 2>You start claiming that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrient regardless of whatever </v>

476
00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:56.320
<v Speaker 2>anecdotal evidence you have good </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning,</v>

477
00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:01.710
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that's weird because people </v>
<v Speaker 2>never just cry bullshit over stuff for </v>

478
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.850
<v Speaker 2>no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People never just go,</v>

479
00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:04.540
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like everything that.</v>

481
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:12.080
<v Speaker 2>Everything that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I saw Katie Perry sitting down with</v>

482
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Deray Mckesson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mckesson or Mac doesn't have a black </v>

483
00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.760
<v Speaker 2>lives matter and Katy Perry was </v>
<v Speaker 2>apologizing about cultural appropriation</v>

484
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:27.090
<v Speaker 2>because I guess she wore braids for </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever fucking reason and she was </v>

485
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:27.490
<v Speaker 2>sitting there is the weirdest thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

486
00:22:27.491 --> 00:22:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're both on a couch and they have no</v>

487
00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:32.080
<v Speaker 2>shoes on and she's touching him and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing a blue vest.</v>

488
00:22:32.081 --> 00:22:33.760
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck am I watching?</v>

489
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.250
<v Speaker 2>Was that in the dream or was that a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>look?</v>

490
00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

492
00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:42.610
<v Speaker 2>he loves that blue vest that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

493
00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.620

<v Speaker 2>It's like Mr Rogers,</v>

494
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.360
<v Speaker 2>Mr Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

499
00:22:54.181 --> 00:22:58.510
<v Speaker 2>And so she's culturally appropriating a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesbian right now with her hair.</v>

500
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.120
<v Speaker 2>She should be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's culturally appropriating.</v>

501
00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:06.150
<v Speaker 2>Literally an old lesbian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She Re hipster an insane asylum that </v>

<v Speaker 2>shits in the mouth.</v>

505
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh my,</v>

510
00:23:21.451 --> 00:23:25.890
<v Speaker 2>I can't play any of this because I don't</v>

<v Speaker 2>appropriation is</v>

518
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:51.040
<v Speaker 4>so crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's like you said,</v>

578
00:25:52.701 --> 00:25:57.701
<v Speaker 4>it's like when a lot of this stuff's </v>
<v Speaker 4>positive and then the ones that pop or </v>

579
00:25:57.701 --> 00:25:58.280
<v Speaker 4>the people that are like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

581

<v Speaker 4>you're fine.</v>

584
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.090
<v Speaker 4>This fifth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

585
00:26:08.091 --> 00:26:10.430
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people out there with </v>
<v Speaker 4>some fucked up faces that would kill for</v>

586
00:26:10.431 --> 00:26:13.730
<v Speaker 4>your face book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>

587
00:26:13.731 --> 00:26:18.731
<v Speaker 4>I was saying about dreams I would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>like when I would detox from like a </v>

588
00:26:18.731 --> 00:26:21.710
<v Speaker 4>fucking booze extravaganza and I went </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of dreams.</v>

589
00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:26.711
<v Speaker 4>That's why I was intrigued because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have fucking crazy dreams where I </v>

590
00:26:26.711 --> 00:26:26.711
<v Speaker 4>would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be so lucid.</v>

591
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.880
<v Speaker 4>I went here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>riders on the storm right now I can say </v>

592
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.150
<v Speaker 4>some stuff that was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a mixed version elevator on </v>

593
00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.500
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Dj version.</v>

594
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.620
<v Speaker 4>So you detox detox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have these dreams and there were</v>

595
00:26:42.621 --> 00:26:45.270
<v Speaker 4>so loose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like walking around the dream and</v>

596
00:26:45.271 --> 00:26:46.190
<v Speaker 4>I'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I knew it.</v>

597
00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:51.210
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was dreaming and I couldn't wake </v>

598
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:51.210
<v Speaker 4>myself up and I would try to wake myself</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

599
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:55.460
<v Speaker 4>So then I would try to like jump dive </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of a window to wake myself up or try</v>

600
00:26:55.981 --> 00:27:00.720
<v Speaker 4>to like do something that will like jar </v>
<v Speaker 4>me awake and then I would do it and then</v>

601
00:27:00.721 --> 00:27:05.721
<v Speaker 4>I would wake up and then I would be in </v>
<v Speaker 4>another fucking dream to not be in my </v>

602
00:27:05.721 --> 00:27:05.721
<v Speaker 4>bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'd be like,</v>

603
00:27:05.721 --> 00:27:07.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go up and get some water.</v>

604
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.760
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

605
00:27:08.761 --> 00:27:11.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm still in the dream because this </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't the shit on my walls.</v>

606
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:15.750
<v Speaker 4>And I'd have to wake myself up again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking gnarly dude.</v>

607
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.690
<v Speaker 4>Like you psyched yourself out in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dream.</v>

608
00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:19.380
<v Speaker 4>Wake up like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

609
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:20.160
<v Speaker 4>wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wake up.</v>

610
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:21.300
<v Speaker 4>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're awake.</v>

611
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.910
<v Speaker 4>Know who does really just more dream </v>
<v Speaker 4>your wicks.</v>

612
00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:26.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it.</v>

613
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.420
<v Speaker 4>So it was kind of fascinated by that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes you wonder what is real.</v>

614
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.080
<v Speaker 4>If you could live in a perpetual dream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on there?</v>

615
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:35.610
<v Speaker 4>You still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something happening.</v>

616
00:27:35.611 --> 00:27:38.430
<v Speaker 4>You're experiencing things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's things are happening.</v>

617
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.310
<v Speaker 4>Whether you're lying there with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>eyes closed or not,</v>

618
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:46.730
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of shit that's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A bunch of experiences that your senses </v>

619
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:49.890
<v Speaker 4>are taken in that are pretty fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>remarkably similar to real life.</v>

620
00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.290
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's why it's so crazy because it</v>

621
00:27:52.291 --> 00:27:53.790
<v Speaker 4>feels real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

622
00:27:53.791 --> 00:27:58.791
<v Speaker 4>That's why dreams like especially lucid </v>
<v Speaker 4>dreams trip you out because it feels </v>

623
00:27:58.791 --> 00:27:58.950
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels real.</v>

624
00:27:58.951 --> 00:28:01.670
<v Speaker 4>But I liked it like when you dream like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a really weird dream,</v>

625
00:28:01.671 --> 00:28:06.671
<v Speaker 4>you just accept the reality of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when I remember a drag I'll be </v>

626
00:28:06.671 --> 00:28:07.170
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

627
00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:12.171
<v Speaker 4>I just totally was in the stream of just</v>
<v Speaker 4>accepted that I was like riding a </v>

628
00:28:12.171 --> 00:28:12.171
<v Speaker 4>rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

629
00:28:12.171 --> 00:28:15.750
<v Speaker 4>Like over a fucking skyscraper to like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Save Katy Perry's face or something.</v>

630
00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.370
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we totally accept them.</v>

631
00:28:17.371 --> 00:28:18.450
<v Speaker 4>Like what I'm doing.</v>

632
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.890
<v Speaker 3>Look at that fucking beard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Fabulous Morrison and people didn't</v>

633
00:28:22.891 --> 00:28:24.800
<v Speaker 3>have beards back then either when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>had.</v>

634
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.840
<v Speaker 3>He grew this beard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The video is him in a fucking beautiful </v>

635
00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.070
<v Speaker 3>old mustang being a bad motherfucker.</v>

636
00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:37.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beards were like considered rogue back </v>

637
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:37.260
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

638
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:37.260
<v Speaker 4>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was this rogue because it came,</v>

639
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.250
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to post Dick on stage,</v>

640
00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:44.530
<v Speaker 4>went to jail for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's driving to the Tempe Improv right </v>

641
00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:47.101
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember that he was going to go see </v>

642
00:28:47.101 --> 00:28:48.370
<v Speaker 4>joey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do we know</v>

643
00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.460
<v Speaker 3>what really goes on when you're asleep </v>
<v Speaker 3>for eight hours?</v>

644
00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.390
<v Speaker 3>How do we know when you're out cold?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you call you're out,</v>

645
00:28:55.420 --> 00:29:00.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck do we know what's actually </v>

646
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.851
<v Speaker 3>happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on in these this dream </v>

647
00:29:02.851 --> 00:29:06.151
<v Speaker 3>states?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you only remember a fraction of </v>

648
00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:06.151
<v Speaker 3>the time you're out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

649
00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:08.920
<v Speaker 3>There's a fraction of the time would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have dreams aren't fake.</v>

650
00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:14.220
<v Speaker 3>What if they're just some alternative </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality that you occasionally </v>

651
00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:18.451
<v Speaker 3>intermingle with when you're conscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>or unconscious rather like when you go </v>

652
00:29:18.451 --> 00:29:22.621
<v Speaker 3>into a dream state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's just like the shadow of </v>

653
00:29:22.621 --> 00:29:22.960
<v Speaker 3>something that just happened that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

654
00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:28.170
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you have like these these moments </v>
<v Speaker 3>that seemed like eight hours to you or </v>

655
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:31.981
<v Speaker 3>five hours to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're really interfacing with some </v>

656
00:29:31.981 --> 00:29:35.310
<v Speaker 3>completely different timeline and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely different reality and the </v>

657
00:29:35.681 --> 00:29:40.681
<v Speaker 3>world is pliable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not locked down like rocks aren't </v>

658
00:29:40.681 --> 00:29:44.041
<v Speaker 3>rocks and water isn't water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everything's fluid and changing </v>

659
00:29:44.041 --> 00:29:45.820
<v Speaker 3>constantly and that's why when you're in</v>
<v Speaker 3>these dreams,</v>

660
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:51.180
<v Speaker 3>you freak out because all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the physics of reality are gone to </v>

661
00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:51.450
<v Speaker 3>Napa and do it.</v>

662
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.700
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there might be a war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

663
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:59.730
<v Speaker 3>just the fact that this world exists in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the state that it exists in this world </v>

664
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:00.010
<v Speaker 3>is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very bizarre.</v>

665
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:03.610
<v Speaker 3>If it wasn't real like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This reality wasn't real.</v>

666
00:30:03.611 --> 00:30:08.500
<v Speaker 3>If we all lived in some sort of a black </v>
<v Speaker 3>and white print version of life and then</v>

667
00:30:08.501 --> 00:30:13.501
<v Speaker 3>you got to experience the life that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know that students stand up and </v>

668
00:30:13.501 --> 00:30:17.131
<v Speaker 3>being in La and flying and planes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>using the Internet and experiencing life</v>

669
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.550
<v Speaker 3>in the 21st century in 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would be like,</v>

670
00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:26.290
<v Speaker 3>this is the craziest psychedelic trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you went to Time Square,</v>

671
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:31.590
<v Speaker 3>you would never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd never experienced anything like </v>

672
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.750
<v Speaker 3>human culture and you went to Time </v>
<v Speaker 3>Square.</v>

673
00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.990
<v Speaker 3>You would be for wreaking the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

674
00:30:34.991 --> 00:30:36.640
<v Speaker 3>that'd be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be insane.</v>

675
00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.770
<v Speaker 3>We're just so used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're so used to it.</v>

676
00:30:38.771 --> 00:30:41.380
<v Speaker 3>We don't realize how bizarre the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>world is.</v>

677
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

678
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's possible that these dream </v>
<v Speaker 3>worlds,</v>

679
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:49.500
<v Speaker 3>that these are just different worlds </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you tap into when you conk out </v>

680
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.850
<v Speaker 3>every night is a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>B could be infinite,</v>

681
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.290
<v Speaker 3>could be you're running a series of </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives like you have multiple lives going</v>

682
00:30:56.291 --> 00:31:01.291
<v Speaker 3>on and your decisions you make in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious life affect all of them and </v>

683
00:31:01.291 --> 00:31:05.701
<v Speaker 3>maybe you have other lives when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>asleep that are conscious when you're </v>

684
00:31:05.701 --> 00:31:09.901
<v Speaker 3>awake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but much like you're asleep and you </v>

685
00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:10.330
<v Speaker 3>don't remember what the fuck is going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're asleep,</v>

686
00:31:10.331 --> 00:31:12.700
<v Speaker 3>they don't remember what the fuck is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on and you interface.</v>

687
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:15.600
<v Speaker 3>You might not just be nick swardson </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up comedian.</v>

688
00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:20.690
<v Speaker 3>You might be an entity that interfaces </v>
<v Speaker 3>with multiple different dimensions in </v>

689
00:31:21.101 --> 00:31:23.290
<v Speaker 3>the night and you just don't remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

690
00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:25.270
<v Speaker 3>Just like you don't remember sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

691
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:30.510
<v Speaker 3>You don't remember dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't remember a lot of shit that </v>

692
00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:30.510
<v Speaker 3>happens when you're conked out for eight</v>
<v Speaker 3>hours,</v>

693
00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:30.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

694
00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they probably don't remember.</v>

695
00:31:31.781 --> 00:31:34.510
<v Speaker 3>When you're awake and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're interfacing,</v>

696
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.660
<v Speaker 3>you're not just shutting off like your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your brain wants to.</v>

697
00:31:37.661 --> 00:31:42.661
<v Speaker 3>Everything needs to shut off so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>your other self in this other dimension </v>

698
00:31:42.661 --> 00:31:46.980
<v Speaker 3>can interact and can go about its its </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and maybe eight hours to it as a </v>

699
00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.120
<v Speaker 3>month or a week to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't even fucking know.</v>

700
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:54.870
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's a huge important part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being a person is that other world has </v>

701
00:31:55.241 --> 00:31:56.830
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to coincide with it.</v>

702
00:31:56.831 --> 00:32:01.831
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's why Michael Jackson died </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they gave him that shit that </v>

703
00:32:01.831 --> 00:32:02.680
<v Speaker 3>knocked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That didn't.</v>

704
00:32:02.681 --> 00:32:07.681
<v Speaker 3>You don't dream under that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would basically put them under </v>

705
00:32:07.681 --> 00:32:09.040
<v Speaker 3>anesthesia every night and he wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get to interface with the other world.</v>

706
00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:10.240
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta go.</v>

707
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.660
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you never know.</v>

708
00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:19.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinated by dreams.</v>

709
00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:21.720
<v Speaker 4>They fucking are weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

710
00:32:21.721 --> 00:32:22.060
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

711
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:25.020
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they do mean something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's another most likely not.</v>

712
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm just covered in spiders and </v>
<v Speaker 4>screening.</v>

713
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:33.620
<v Speaker 4>I think that's basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you can let her roll your workout </v>

714
00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.351
<v Speaker 4>stuff in your dream sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you'll experience that workout </v>

715
00:32:36.351 --> 00:32:36.351
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't.</v>

716
00:32:36.351 --> 00:32:38.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't work out every names.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never go to the gym and dreams.</v>

717
00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 4>That's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never fucking</v>

718
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 2>ever worked out and in a dream have </v>
<v Speaker 2>never done that either.</v>

719
00:32:43.281 --> 00:32:47.450
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to throw kicks in my dreams.</v>

720
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:53.110
<v Speaker 2>I used to like when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but especially like girlfriends would </v>

721
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.450
<v Speaker 2>complain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like twitch.</v>

722
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.430
<v Speaker 2>I would like literally like throw a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kick.</v>

723
00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:58.190
<v Speaker 2>I remember when bill permit jokes about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

724
00:32:58.191 --> 00:33:03.191
<v Speaker 2>like sounded like a Bruce Bruce </v>
<v Speaker 2>springsteen song throwing kicks in the </v>

725
00:33:03.191 --> 00:33:05.780
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like an old ice house chronicles.</v>

726
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:07.680
<v Speaker 2>We went on a whole rant about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really interesting.</v>

727
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.130
<v Speaker 2>Springsteen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guys have that problem.</v>

728
00:33:10.131 --> 00:33:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Like fighters have that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

729
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:15.110
<v Speaker 2>my fucking old roommate in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't wake him up.</v>

730
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:20.140
<v Speaker 2>You had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to like throw something at them </v>

731
00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.230
<v Speaker 2>from across the room and then hide </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he.</v>

732
00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Because he would wake up in an immediate</v>
<v Speaker 2>Malay.</v>

733
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:28.730
<v Speaker 2>It was immediately like game time and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought we found out the hard way.</v>

734
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.900
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

735
00:33:29.901 --> 00:33:34.901
<v Speaker 2>wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it was just thing they name and it </v>

736
00:33:34.901 --> 00:33:37.811
<v Speaker 2>was just like he would just even take </v>
<v Speaker 2>him like fucking like 15 seconds to </v>

737
00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:39.830
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back down.</v>

738
00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

739
00:33:40.971 --> 00:33:43.970
<v Speaker 2>so I dunno what every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alternate every fucking day.</v>

740
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.660
<v Speaker 2>What if an alarm clock woke him up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wakes up swinging or no,</v>

741
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:49.090
<v Speaker 2>that has be a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would have to be a person's.</v>

742
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just put an alarm clock next to him </v>

743
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:54.100
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't afford it.</v>

744
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.200
<v Speaker 2>We were the alarm clock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bloody alarm clock.</v>

745
00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't like to be woken up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man and they get super mad at you and </v>

746
00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:02.260
<v Speaker 2>the other people just chill like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

747
00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.710
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on and why?</v>

748
00:34:03.711 --> 00:34:05.360
<v Speaker 2>You guys waking me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey man,</v>

749
00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:10.510
<v Speaker 2>where are you naked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen someone get knocked out </v>

750
00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:10.670
<v Speaker 2>and they ask questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think like what's going on here?</v>

751
00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:12.620
<v Speaker 2>So it's the weirdest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

752
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you guys here?</v>

753
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Like why are you guys staring out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

754
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:18.770
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it before but I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not in front of me.</v>

755
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

756
00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:24.940
<v Speaker 2>It's weird to the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human brain when it gets shut off </v>

757
00:34:25.101 --> 00:34:28.640
<v Speaker 2>and then comes back on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like an old windows,</v>

758
00:34:28.641 --> 00:34:33.430
<v Speaker 2>95 computer when it reboots and you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the das thing right now you see the,</v>

759
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:36.380
<v Speaker 2>what is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that black with a white screen,</v>

760
00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:41.410
<v Speaker 2>the boot screen does it dot the dos </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen and then it would take a long </v>

761
00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:46.211
<v Speaker 2>time to boot up and it'd be all Janky </v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit and you wouldn't be able to </v>

762
00:34:46.211 --> 00:34:47.390
<v Speaker 2>click on the Internet yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like when you get claimed,</v>

763
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:50.450
<v Speaker 2>like I imagined football players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing,</v>

764
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:55.750
<v Speaker 2>but they oftentimes don't remember shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't remember anything that </v>

765
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.750
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

766
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:56.720
<v Speaker 2>They might not even remember like </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting into the ring.</v>

767
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:58.820
<v Speaker 2>They might not remember any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna say.</v>

768
00:34:58.821 --> 00:35:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean you've seen so many fighters go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>

769
00:35:00.741 --> 00:35:03.710
<v Speaker 2>Do they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they ever remember the knockout?</v>

770
00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Some of them do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

771
00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Some of them remember everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They remember seeing like,</v>

772
00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.470
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that last moment where he's like,</v>

773
00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:10.340
<v Speaker 2>he caught me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

774
00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:11.470
<v Speaker 2>And they're just out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

775
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.880
<v Speaker 2>they remember getting hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll remember what hit them.</v>

776
00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.040
<v Speaker 2>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them don't remember anything.</v>

777
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:18.540
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing about brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

778
00:35:18.541 --> 00:35:21.380
<v Speaker 2>it gets completely variable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's variable,</v>

779
00:35:21.381 --> 00:35:26.381
<v Speaker 2>like there's some guys that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been knocked out a ton of times </v>

780
00:35:26.381 --> 00:35:27.650
<v Speaker 2>and they're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

781
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Like Alistair overeem is a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

782
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:33.920
<v Speaker 2>He's been knocked out of gang of times </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's fine like it.</v>

783
00:35:33.921 --> 00:35:35.720
<v Speaker 2>At least he appears to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very lucid,</v>

784
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:38.060
<v Speaker 2>very articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a,</v>

785
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.580
<v Speaker 3>he's got his composure but after fights </v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't,</v>

786
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you get cracked,</v>

787
00:35:43.681 --> 00:35:48.681
<v Speaker 3>like he got knocked out when he fought </v>
<v Speaker 3>steep Emile church and this is not his </v>

788
00:35:48.681 --> 00:35:52.041
<v Speaker 3>fault and I said after this that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>think we should interview with fighters </v>

789
00:35:52.041 --> 00:35:55.341
<v Speaker 3>anymore after they get knocked out </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he said that he thought that </v>

790
00:35:55.341 --> 00:35:58.191
<v Speaker 3>Steve Bay tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought he had the guillotine and </v>

791
00:35:58.191 --> 00:35:58.191
<v Speaker 3>steepbank tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

792
00:35:58.191 --> 00:36:02.290
<v Speaker 3>So he was saying that in the replay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had to play the replay back </v>

793
00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:03.180
<v Speaker 3>because we didn't know if he was right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

794
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.120
<v Speaker 3>we'll play it because he was saying this</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me while I was interviewing them.</v>

795
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:08.400
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we played it and you couldn't see the</v>

796
00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:13.410
<v Speaker 3>tabby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he believed it was just because </v>

797
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:13.410
<v Speaker 3>he just got knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

798
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:15.360
<v Speaker 3>that's not a good idea to interview </v>
<v Speaker 3>people after they get knocked out.</v>

799
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.420
<v Speaker 3>Terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrible.</v>

800
00:36:16.421 --> 00:36:18.750
<v Speaker 3>And I've thought it before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never,</v>

801
00:36:18.751 --> 00:36:19.590
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

802
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:24.950
<v Speaker 3>I just felt a felt bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I had to play the video because he </v>

803
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:26.640
<v Speaker 3>said that it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if he said that it happened,</v>

804
00:36:26.641 --> 00:36:28.950
<v Speaker 3>my job as an interviewer is to play that</v>
<v Speaker 3>video.</v>

805
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.430
<v Speaker 3>I just expected him to say something </v>
<v Speaker 3>along the lines of,</v>

806
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:33.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I had um,</v>

807
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:36.600
<v Speaker 3>if you could remember the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I had him,</v>

808
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.850
<v Speaker 3>but he got them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got me fair play to him,</v>

809
00:36:38.851 --> 00:36:40.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the normal stuff.</v>

810
00:36:40.021 --> 00:36:41.460
<v Speaker 3>Give them a chance to represent </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

811
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.010
<v Speaker 3>So when that was going on I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

812
00:36:44.011 --> 00:36:45.570
<v Speaker 3>this is not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like,</v>

813
00:36:45.571 --> 00:36:48.270
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just got knocked out cold and there's</v>

814
00:36:48.271 --> 00:36:50.130
<v Speaker 3>no way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like three minutes later.</v>

815
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no way.</v>

816
00:36:51.151 --> 00:36:56.151
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then everybody gets mad at them for </v>

817
00:36:56.151 --> 00:36:56.151
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

818
00:36:56.151 --> 00:36:56.151
<v Speaker 3>you can't get mad at someone for that.</v>

819
00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:57.780
<v Speaker 3>It's too weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

820
00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:01.080
<v Speaker 3>So this study came out today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Brendan Schaub.</v>

821
00:37:01.081 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 3>Send it to me because he's freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It said that.</v>

822
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.590
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like 97 percent.</v>

823
00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That they examined 111 former NFL </v>

824
00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:13.500
<v Speaker 3>players.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only one didn't have cte.</v>

825
00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:15.210
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

826
00:37:15.211 --> 00:37:20.211
<v Speaker 3>they found that 87 percent of people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>play football at any level had cte.</v>

827
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:27.090
<v Speaker 3>This is what's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men who played football at all levels,</v>

828
00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.870
<v Speaker 3>all levels for like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

829
00:37:29.871 --> 00:37:31.860
<v Speaker 3>I assume that's got to mean like high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>

830
00:37:31.861 --> 00:37:32.740
<v Speaker 3>including high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

831
00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.550
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And who is that guy?</v>

832
00:37:35.551 --> 00:37:36.930
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talked about this before.</v>

833
00:37:36.931 --> 00:37:39.720
<v Speaker 3>Forgive me for not a football fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked football,</v>

834
00:37:39.721 --> 00:37:43.500
<v Speaker 3>but just don't know enough about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is that guy that jumped on the car?</v>

835
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.240
<v Speaker 3>Chris Henry was his name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

836
00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:48.570
<v Speaker 3>That guy was young and like a super stud</v>
<v Speaker 3>athlete.</v>

837
00:37:48.571 --> 00:37:50.280
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have been like 25,</v>

838
00:37:50.281 --> 00:37:51.150
<v Speaker 3>26,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

839
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.550
<v Speaker 3>When they did an autopsy on him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found out he had severe.</v>

840
00:37:53.551 --> 00:37:57.690
<v Speaker 3>CTE was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's brain is wrecked like pole.</v>

841
00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:02.770
<v Speaker 3>See if you could pull that study up </v>
<v Speaker 3>because people were super shocked </v>

842
00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:02.770
<v Speaker 3>because he was in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

843
00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:05.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was in his prime and he was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>super athlete.</v>

844
00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:07.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>

845
00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

846
00:38:09.331 --> 00:38:14.331
<v Speaker 3>you know a lot about football.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What or how much of a bad ass was he a </v>

847
00:38:14.331 --> 00:38:17.580
<v Speaker 3>as far as like top wide receivers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't maybe like in the top 10,</v>

848
00:38:17.581 --> 00:38:18.540
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was.</v>

849
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:19.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was starting.</v>

850
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.480
<v Speaker 3>He was starting to get to come into his </v>
<v Speaker 3>own man.</v>

851
00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.620
<v Speaker 3>He died in a traffic accident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had chronic traumatic encephalopathy,</v>

852
00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:27.390
<v Speaker 3>Pathi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always fucked that up.</v>

853
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.690
<v Speaker 3>And cephalopathy and sap and sap and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cephalon hmm.</v>

854
00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.700
<v Speaker 3>That's a sense of apathy and Sepa </v>
<v Speaker 3>Apathy,</v>

855
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:39.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pathi and SEFA law and cephalopathy and </v>

856
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:40.990
<v Speaker 3>cephalopathy.</v>

857
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.400
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

858
00:38:42.401 --> 00:38:44.260
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be neurosurgeons going crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

859
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.390
<v Speaker 3>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You idiot.</v>

860
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:51.960
<v Speaker 3>You can't even pronounce a word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A form of degenerative brain damage </v>

861
00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.270
<v Speaker 3>caused by multiple hits to the head at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time of his death.</v>

862
00:38:52.271 --> 00:38:55.120
<v Speaker 3>According to the scientist had brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>injury research center,</v>

863
00:38:55.121 --> 00:38:58.180
<v Speaker 3>a research center affiliated with West </v>
<v Speaker 3>Virginia University.</v>

864
00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:03.440
<v Speaker 3>The guy says in quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would have been very happy if the </v>

865
00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.211
<v Speaker 3>results have been negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but multiple areas of Chris Henry's </v>

866
00:39:06.211 --> 00:39:07.720
<v Speaker 3>brain showed cte and then they go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>details about it.</v>

867
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:11.980
<v Speaker 3>So you gotta think like here's a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's in his prime 28 years old,</v>

868
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:17.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just bad motherfucker and he's not </v>

869
00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.140
<v Speaker 3>showing any signs of like falling apart </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's got ce cte.</v>

870
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:22.480
<v Speaker 4>It's not scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

871
00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:24.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean it makes you think too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I talked about that.</v>

872
00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:26.980
<v Speaker 4>A lot of my friends is I'm a big nfl </v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

873
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:30.150
<v Speaker 4>diehard football fan and we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other day like does,</v>

874
00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.940
<v Speaker 4>does it continue?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like 25 years from now,</v>

875
00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.850
<v Speaker 4>the rates for a lot of these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

876
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.480
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying like does the NFL,</v>

877
00:39:37.481 --> 00:39:38.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh I see what you're saying.</v>

878
00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:44.130
<v Speaker 4>Does the NFL continue?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean at some point these studies and </v>

879
00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:44.710
<v Speaker 4>these things are going to come out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just gonna be,</v>

880
00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:46.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's horrifying.</v>

881
00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:52.110
<v Speaker 3>Better off fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you can get knocked out and </v>

882
00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:52.110
<v Speaker 3>fighting and you definitely get brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>damage and fighting,</v>

883
00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.680
<v Speaker 3>but I think if you become like a mighty </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouse,</v>

884
00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:59.070
<v Speaker 3>like if you get to a skill level that </v>
<v Speaker 3>very few people get to when you were at </v>

885
00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:02.230
<v Speaker 3>a super elite skill level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd probably take less damage.</v>

886
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:07.830
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to say because there's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>some fucking wars with the mighty mouse </v>

887
00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:09.670
<v Speaker 3>thing might be a bad example because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so fucking good.</v>

888
00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.880
<v Speaker 3>A lot of his fights or just mismatches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

889
00:40:12.881 --> 00:40:17.881
<v Speaker 3>It's not like there's another mighty </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouse out there that's trying to fuck </v>

890
00:40:17.881 --> 00:40:17.881
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like someone and not everyone can be</v>

891
00:40:17.881 --> 00:40:19.120
<v Speaker 3>the mighty mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

892
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:24.210
<v Speaker 3>Like it has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be various levels of </v>

893
00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:25.990
<v Speaker 3>competency across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like if you could fight the way that</v>

894
00:40:25.991 --> 00:40:27.550
<v Speaker 3>guy fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he doesn't.</v>

895
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:29.860
<v Speaker 3>He's not a brawler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not doing anything stupid.</v>

896
00:40:29.861 --> 00:40:32.980
<v Speaker 3>He's not just like biting on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouthpiece and throwing bombs.</v>

897
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:38.280
<v Speaker 3>He's super technical in his approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a consummate professional and like </v>

898
00:40:38.951 --> 00:40:43.951
<v Speaker 3>a strategic wizard and how he approaches</v>
<v Speaker 3>interacting with guys who are almost </v>

899
00:40:43.951 --> 00:40:46.110
<v Speaker 3>strategically wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although that was caught that though I'm</v>

900
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.390
<v Speaker 3>a wizard at all over your tents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

901
00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:52.450
<v Speaker 3>but what he does is just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably the safest way to do it,</v>

902
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:55.690
<v Speaker 3>the smartest way to do it because he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just so competent it,</v>

903
00:40:55.691 --> 00:40:57.710
<v Speaker 3>he's not getting hit and he's his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

904
00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:02.820
<v Speaker 3>his tactics are so clever and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>skillful that he's able to like avoid a </v>

905
00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:07.900
<v Speaker 3>lot of like big bombs that come his way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Football players aren't avoiding shit.</v>

906
00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:10.870
<v Speaker 4>Now you're getting hit getting hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're getting hit.</v>

907
00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.530
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no mighty mouse in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>football world,</v>

908
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a linebacker,</v>

909
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:16.980
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking hitting people or hitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

910
00:41:16.981 --> 00:41:17.730
<v Speaker 3>You're hitting them.</v>

911
00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:19.290
<v Speaker 4>If you're on the line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>

912
00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:21.340
<v Speaker 4>It's nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean to,</v>

913
00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.730
<v Speaker 4>not just that he's not even getting hit </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the head.</v>

914
00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:27.090
<v Speaker 4>They're saying doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like slamming each other.</v>

915
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:30.990
<v Speaker 4>That stuff jerks your neck and your head</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all that stuff.</v>

916
00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:32.850
<v Speaker 4>Just the sheer impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to sell the.</v>

917
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.550
<v Speaker 4>They just started this weekend.</v>

918
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:39.550
<v Speaker 1>This is like the pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're calling the American flag </v>

919
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:41.861
<v Speaker 1>football leagues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's like some former NFL players </v>

920
00:41:41.861 --> 00:41:44.171
<v Speaker 1>in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they just blow guys on the </v>

921
00:41:44.171 --> 00:41:46.271
<v Speaker 1>field yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is going to be </v>

922
00:41:46.271 --> 00:41:46.271
<v Speaker 1>interesting to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

923
00:41:46.271 --> 00:41:46.820
<v Speaker 1>that's football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was depressing.</v>

924
00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Why'd you show that you can't have that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one that guy knows while he's doing </v>

925
00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:51.850
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The logo put on figure skating,</v>

926
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.410
<v Speaker 1>figure skating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to get something more manly.</v>

927
00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Rhythmic gymnastics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked their helmets or lack thereof </v>

928
00:41:59.920 --> 00:41:59.920
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

929
00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.930
<v Speaker 1>I think that's very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

930
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:03.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just,</v>

931
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.380
<v Speaker 1>there's a rugby helmets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are rugby helmets,</v>

932
00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.400
<v Speaker 1>helmets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the headgear.</v>

933
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.750
<v Speaker 1>There's more protect your ears and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be going to help them if they had ground</v>

934
00:42:11.751 --> 00:42:13.790
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe a little bit.</v>

935
00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I would just wear ear muffs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to have those things in.</v>

936
00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:21.520
<v Speaker 1>When I competed in the taekwondo days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's got knocked out and one of </v>

937
00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:22.730
<v Speaker 1>the real horrible things was that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get kicked in the head knocked out.</v>

938
00:42:22.731 --> 00:42:25.760
<v Speaker 1>They usually out cold and their head </v>
<v Speaker 1>would bounce off the ground.</v>

939
00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.130
<v Speaker 1>So depending upon where the fight was </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking place,</v>

940
00:42:28.131 --> 00:42:33.131
<v Speaker 1>most of the time there was no surface </v>
<v Speaker 1>like we would fight like on an actual </v>

941
00:42:33.131 --> 00:42:36.941
<v Speaker 1>basketball court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a video of me fighting on </v>

942
00:42:36.941 --> 00:42:37.280
<v Speaker 1>an actual basketball court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the lines on the court,</v>

943
00:42:37.281 --> 00:42:42.281
<v Speaker 1>it's solid wood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you kick a guy and they'd fall </v>

944
00:42:42.281 --> 00:42:45.110
<v Speaker 1>back in their head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would bounce off the off the wood and it</v>

945
00:42:45.111 --> 00:42:50.111
<v Speaker 1>was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some people got knocked out and it </v>

946
00:42:50.111 --> 00:42:50.111
<v Speaker 1>was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they started making.</v>

947
00:42:50.111 --> 00:42:54.251
<v Speaker 1>People were first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a head gear that you can just </v>

948
00:42:54.251 --> 00:42:55.400
<v Speaker 1>wear on the back of your head literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to protect you when you get knocked</v>

949
00:42:55.401 --> 00:42:56.840
<v Speaker 1>out so that your head didn't bounce off.</v>

950
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:59.690
<v Speaker 1>And then some guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started making you.</v>

951
00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Some guys voluntarily did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started making you aware of the </v>

952
00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:05.300
<v Speaker 1>bigger all-inclusive helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a big foam.</v>

953
00:43:05.301 --> 00:43:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Protect it around your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the you by football games,</v>

954
00:43:08.271 --> 00:43:09.320
<v Speaker 1>like a foam?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

955
00:43:09.321 --> 00:43:11.070
<v Speaker 1>it's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can find it.</v>

956
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Pull up a taekwondo head gear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like your face is exposed,</v>

957
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:22.630
<v Speaker 1>but like you have like these things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover your ears and the foam over the </v>

958
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:24.560
<v Speaker 1>protects him head Jerry later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like.</v>

959
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:26.660
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an adidas one,</v>

960
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:32.020
<v Speaker 1>so it's like see how it's got the foam </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the ears and the foam on the top </v>

961
00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:35.201
<v Speaker 1>of the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your face is completely exposed and </v>

962
00:43:35.201 --> 00:43:35.201
<v Speaker 1>most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that one is.</v>

963
00:43:35.201 --> 00:43:37.470
<v Speaker 1>That's not a Friday the 13th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one you had on his.</v>

964
00:43:37.471 --> 00:43:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real tech window mass.</v>

965
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.450
<v Speaker 1>The white one or the Red One?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an adidas one.</v>

966
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's in those are world taekwondo </v>

967
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:47.240
<v Speaker 1>federation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once some of the International Taekwondo</v>

968
00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Federation ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those tournaments,</v>

969
00:43:48.501 --> 00:43:53.501
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did a differently and they did the </v>

970
00:43:53.501 --> 00:43:55.310
<v Speaker 1>fucking stuck old school a lot of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember they still had the,</v>

971
00:43:55.311 --> 00:44:00.311
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wood floors and there was no head </v>

972
00:44:00.311 --> 00:44:00.311
<v Speaker 1>gear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

973
00:44:00.311 --> 00:44:01.610
<v Speaker 1>I think they probably change them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>time goes on,</v>

974
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.980
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

975
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:08.530
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those head gears were designed really </v>

976
00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:08.530
<v Speaker 1>mostly to protect you when you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked out from your head,</v>

977
00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:13.481
<v Speaker 1>bounced off the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they start making people find on </v>

978
00:44:13.481 --> 00:44:13.481
<v Speaker 1>pads too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After a while they changed the flooring.</v>

979
00:44:13.481 --> 00:44:14.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

980
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:15.920
<v Speaker 1>heads is key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

981
00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.680
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hard wood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

982
00:44:18.681 --> 00:44:21.710
<v Speaker 1>It's been the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the being I found on the fucking meant a</v>

983
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:24.410
<v Speaker 1>hockey rink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hockey rink that didn't have any water</v>

984
00:44:24.411 --> 00:44:26.930
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put a tarp down like God,</v>

985
00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.670
<v Speaker 1>they put a tarp down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fought on concrete.</v>

986
00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 1>It was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you put tarp down at that</v>

987
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:33.060
<v Speaker 2>point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get knocked out.</v>

988
00:44:33.061 --> 00:44:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Two in one dude who got knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His eyebrow bounced off the,</v>

989
00:44:37.711 --> 00:44:39.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the concrete.</v>

990
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

991
00:44:39.691 --> 00:44:44.691
<v Speaker 2>there was basically just like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the bottom of a ice skating </v>

992
00:44:44.691 --> 00:44:44.820
<v Speaker 2>rink would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would drink.</v>

993
00:44:44.821 --> 00:44:47.010
<v Speaker 2>It was for the bay state games too is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big tournament.</v>

994
00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:50.790
<v Speaker 2>It was a big deal because the bay state </v>
<v Speaker 2>games or the Olympic festival and it was</v>

995
00:44:50.791 --> 00:44:54.060
<v Speaker 2>the first time and I think only time </v>
<v Speaker 2>they ever had taekwondo in it.</v>

996
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:55.780
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I were going,</v>

997
00:44:55.781 --> 00:44:57.600
<v Speaker 2>I was going to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was 19,</v>

998
00:44:57.601 --> 00:44:59.880
<v Speaker 2>so it was like 86.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

999
00:44:59.881 --> 00:45:01.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys,</v>

1000
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:03.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one google taekwondo tournament,</v>

1001
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.900
<v Speaker 2>kids on a hardwood floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1002
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:09.780
<v Speaker 2>see this might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be a tournament where they spar</v>

1003
00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:11.610
<v Speaker 2>or it might be a tournament where they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1004
00:45:11.611 --> 00:45:13.050
<v Speaker 2>that looks like they have headgear on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground,</v>

1005
00:45:13.051 --> 00:45:14.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

1006
00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:19.660
<v Speaker 2>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have forums turned out that little </v>

1007
00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:19.660
<v Speaker 2>red thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1008
00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are head gears.</v>

1009
00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:23.220
<v Speaker 2>What's the bar behind the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck that is.</v>

1010
00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Like a float day for a pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that is.</v>

1011
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.110
<v Speaker 2>That might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1012
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:30.690
<v Speaker 2>a different kind of tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be a point tournament.</v>

1013
00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.730
<v Speaker 2>I think it's floating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>floating to new.</v>

1014
00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a new sport that comes to the Dildo</v>
<v Speaker 2>whipping.</v>

1015
00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:43.050
<v Speaker 2>So I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about this this past </v>

1016
00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:46.640

<v Speaker 2>I was talking to somebody about that </v>

1017
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.521
<v Speaker 2>Brown bunny movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've talked about that movie before </v>

<v Speaker 2>he was a close 78.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And probably fucked her career for a few</v>

<v Speaker 2>years too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Go back the list bro.</v>

1069
00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.170
<v Speaker 4>Right up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1071

<v Speaker 4>movie.</v>

1072
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:01.770
<v Speaker 4>Boys don't cry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.490
<v Speaker 4>Then she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>time to fuck.</v>

1074
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:08.790
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks like time to fuck was before </v>

1075
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.790
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1076
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:12.050
<v Speaker 4>no Brown bunny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking after boys don't cry.</v>

1077
00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:15.910
<v Speaker 4>That's down now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it goes lower.</v>

1078
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:20.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm going the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking the top was the more </v>

1079
00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:20.970
<v Speaker 4>recent ones.</v>

1080
00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:21.340
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1081
00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:22.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy choice.</v>

1082
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.420
<v Speaker 4>So she's still done a bunch of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>since Brown bunny.</v>

1083
00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:31.050
<v Speaker 4>She did Zodiac.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean she was willing to be on big </v>

1084
00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:33.490
<v Speaker 4>love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not an agent must be so confused.</v>

1085
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:36.430
<v Speaker 4>What do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had a real.</v>

1086
00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:39.430
<v Speaker 4>He had a real backlash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vincent Gallo,</v>

1087
00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:45.030
<v Speaker 4>didn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think he's one of those like </v>

1088
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.400
<v Speaker 4>self imploding dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he was ever really like.</v>

1089
00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:46.630
<v Speaker 4>He did Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>66,</v>

1090
00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:48.590
<v Speaker 4>which is actually a cool movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

1091
00:48:48.591 --> 00:48:50.860
<v Speaker 4>she never stopped working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you go 2003,</v>

1092
00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.230
<v Speaker 4>killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.260
<v Speaker 4>So it didn't impact her negatively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe did.</v>

1094
00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:57.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she still worked.</v>

1095
00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:00.730
<v Speaker 4>But you don't really hear about that </v>
<v Speaker 4>dude anymore.</v>

1096
00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.610
<v Speaker 4>And before that movie he was like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a big.</v>

1097
00:49:03.611 --> 00:49:04.960
<v Speaker 4>He was in Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>66.</v>

1098
00:49:04.961 --> 00:49:05.890
<v Speaker 4>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1099
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:07.810
<v Speaker 4>That's a great fucking movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just said that.</v>

1100
00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:08.950

1102
00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:16.170

1106
00:49:18.131 --> 00:49:23.131
<v Speaker 4>I feel embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't listening to him pray for the </v>

1107
00:49:23.131 --> 00:49:23.890
<v Speaker 4>cardinal sin of conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just struggling with my memory.</v>

1108
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:27.820

<v Speaker 4>minutes into it and I thought we were </v>

1118

<v Speaker 4>done and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right.</v>

1119
00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.050

<v Speaker 4>we have to be done.</v>

1120
00:49:59.051 --> 00:50:00.160

1125
00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:08.890
<v Speaker 4>It was so intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had done yoga a couple times,</v>

00:50:08.891 --> 00:50:10.900
<v Speaker 4>I gotten cocky and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>just not cool man.</v>

1130
00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.710
<v Speaker 4>It was too intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's intense.</v>

1131
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:24.190
<v Speaker 4>Like you definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was dizzy and.</v>

1132
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:29.790
<v Speaker 4>But you know what it is dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not the best if you have to use </v>

1133
00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:29.790
<v Speaker 4>your brain</v>

1134
00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:32.360
<v Speaker 2>right afterwards for like really solid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like three or four hours,</v>

1135
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:37.310
<v Speaker 2>but it is really good in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>overall,</v>

1136
00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:42.480
<v Speaker 2>like the overall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overall your health and the way you </v>

1137
00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.760
<v Speaker 2>interface with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way more chilled out if you do it a lot.</v>

1138
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Shit.</v>

1139
00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:49.880
<v Speaker 2>So you did it and then just immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>got in your car and then drove away.</v>

1140
00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:55.540
<v Speaker 2>What else do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stay tent up plot of land.</v>

1141
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Lump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should go up in that area.</v>

1142
00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took a shower and got the fuck out of </v>

1143
00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:04.420
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got something to eat.</v>

1144
00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shower.</v>

1145
00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:09.460
<v Speaker 2>I did of course got to sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something really good </v>

1146
00:51:09.621 --> 00:51:11.850
<v Speaker 2>for your body though that especially </v>
<v Speaker 2>that hot one.</v>

1147
00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.190
<v Speaker 2>I think that 104 degrees and stretching </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1148
00:51:14.191 --> 00:51:17.150
<v Speaker 2>I just think it makes you more pliable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely makes you more flexible.</v>

1149
00:51:17.151 --> 00:51:22.151
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get into positions that you </v>

1150
00:51:22.151 --> 00:51:22.151
<v Speaker 2>can't get into when you're cold.</v>

1151
00:51:22.151 --> 00:51:25.780
<v Speaker 2>So that means to me like there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some sort of a benefit in being </v>

1152
00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:27.860
<v Speaker 2>like really warm in terms of pliability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The muscle tissue.</v>

1153
00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred percent,</v>

1154
00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:31.030
<v Speaker 2>a hundred percent that settlement </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>

1155
00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:32.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean it wouldn't be that popular if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't,</v>

1156
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.900
<v Speaker 2>it didn't have some kind of effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1157
00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Even like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1158
00:51:36.711 --> 00:51:41.711
<v Speaker 2>it's like even like getting in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation when you're cold and </v>

1159
00:51:41.711 --> 00:51:42.050
<v Speaker 2>stretching or trying to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>active at the sucks.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you don't perform at your best when it's</v>

1163

<v Speaker 2>80 below zero outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1164
00:51:48.861 --> 00:51:53.861
<v Speaker 2>Like I get a massage the other day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was freezing in the air conditioning </v>

<v Speaker 2>central.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least they gave it a shot.</v>

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:14.131
<v Speaker 2>canceled it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did two seasons of six episodes each </v>

1195
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.560
<v Speaker 2>season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can still watch it,</v>

<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1200
00:53:23.811 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 2>We wanted to bring you on to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that was called</v>

1201
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:31.160
<v Speaker 4>Bro Sasson and it was about a guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>raised by an assassin and then he got </v>

1202
00:53:32.461 --> 00:53:37.461
<v Speaker 4>the assassin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dad feels bad that his son never had a </v>

1203
00:53:37.461 --> 00:53:38.160
<v Speaker 4>real life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just grew up in a sas environment,</v>

1204
00:53:38.161 --> 00:53:43.161
<v Speaker 4>that jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he sends them to college and becomes </v>

1205
00:53:43.161 --> 00:53:43.950
<v Speaker 4>the ultimate Frat dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he moonlights as an assassin still,</v>

1206
00:53:43.951 --> 00:53:45.540
<v Speaker 4>but he's still a frat guy during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

1207
00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:50.620
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:53.211
<v Speaker 4>the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the or in the attic and then I would </v>

<v Speaker 4>be an assassin that like on the down low</v>
<v Speaker 4>at night,</v>

1210

<v Speaker 4>or too drunk and we wanted to you to be </v>

1211
00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.390
<v Speaker 4>one of the guys that would be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>recurring assassin.</v>

1323
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.290

<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

1324
00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:52.320
<v Speaker 2>We can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if we can know that he's got a </v>

1325
00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.181
<v Speaker 2>special on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to ask for permission where the </v>

1326
00:58:54.181 --> 00:58:55.390
<v Speaker 2>store is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard,</v>

1327
00:58:55.391 --> 00:58:56.410
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

1328
00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:01.440
<v Speaker 2>hard being an executive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard being what we call a content </v>

1329
00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:01.440
<v Speaker 2>provider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick,</v>

1330
00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.580
<v Speaker 2>I believe you're a content provider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got to provide with comedy central.</v>

1331
00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.010
<v Speaker 4>But I mean I'm just saying in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's that hard.</v>

1332
00:59:06.011 --> 00:59:09.850
<v Speaker 4>If you have talent that is proven in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you trust.</v>

1333
00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:13.840
<v Speaker 4>Like if I a network and you brought me a</v>
<v Speaker 4>show that would for me,</v>

1334
00:59:13.841 --> 00:59:16.810
<v Speaker 4>that would be a 90 percent chance that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would go to pilot for sure.</v>

1335
00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Is nicked become executive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm figuring out my career was,</v>

1336
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing the odds before they weren't 90 </v>

1337
00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:27.100
<v Speaker 1>slash 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that good.</v>

1338
00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Was it like 50 slash 50?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I liked the odd.</v>

1339
00:59:28.761 --> 00:59:32.780
<v Speaker 1>So do you think you could maybe do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My job for me?</v>

1340
00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:34.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be one of you.</v>

1344
00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:46.470
<v Speaker 4>I have not thought about doing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I hear it.</v>

1345
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:47.970
<v Speaker 4>I have so many friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all,</v>

<v Speaker 4>comedians and writers and suffer like </v>

<v Speaker 4>Well why don't you just start doing shit</v>

1353
00:59:59.691 --> 01:00:04.691

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1374
01:00:48.841 --> 01:00:50.000

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1375
01:00:50.001 --> 01:00:51.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even.</v>

1376
01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:54.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like counting on them to know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck they're doing.</v>

1377
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:56.020
<v Speaker 1>They know what the fuck they're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1378
01:00:56.021 --> 01:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>A really be a TV executive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who wants to do that?</v>

1379
01:00:58.941 --> 01:01:02.300
<v Speaker 1>How many people want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might think they want to do it,</v>

1380
01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.370
<v Speaker 1>but once you realize like the stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>

1381
01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:07.760
<v Speaker 1>fuck all that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem that complicated though,</v>

1382
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:09.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1383
01:01:09.771 --> 01:01:12.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you have people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1384
01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.840
<v Speaker 1>someone could bring you Seinfeld and </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and you know,</v>

1385
01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:21.800
<v Speaker 1>the whatever name some other show brings</v>
<v Speaker 1>some big ass frazier,</v>

1386
01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.690
<v Speaker 1>some big ass sitcoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cheers.</v>

1387
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Cheers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example.</v>

1388
01:01:25.461 --> 01:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>And you look like a goddamn genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy that got chairs in the air.</v>

1389
01:01:28.531 --> 01:01:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could've just got lucky.</v>

1390
01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:36.280
<v Speaker 1>They could have brought you the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex in the city or the single guy or a </v>

1391
01:01:36.411 --> 01:01:41.411
<v Speaker 1>lot of sitcoms and everybody forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could have brought you a lot of </v>

1392
01:01:41.411 --> 01:01:41.411
<v Speaker 1>bulk toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The musical.</v>

1393
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of Bads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coach,</v>

1394
01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:48.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember coach like coach the fuck up.</v>

1395
01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Fuck is wrong with you man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My bad,</v>

1396
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:53.540
<v Speaker 1>bad experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's you.</v>

1397
01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:58.541
<v Speaker 1>That's don't put that on coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy who was a writer for that show </v>

1398
01:01:58.541 --> 01:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>on a Sitcom I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like whoa.</v>

1399
01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:03.500
<v Speaker 1>He just acted up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>backed it up.</v>

1400
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Just swing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with the old double edge,</v>

1401
01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.930
<v Speaker 1>broadsword chop shop</v>

1402
01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.400
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's a different conversation.</v>

1403
01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:16.420
<v Speaker 4>Have a network,</v>
<v Speaker 4>major neck and like in one of those </v>

1404
01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:16.420
<v Speaker 4>main,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like NBC,</v>

1405
01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:16.830
<v Speaker 4>CBS,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's so arbitrary on what's going</v>

1406
01:02:16.831 --> 01:02:17.630
<v Speaker 4>to be a hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1407
01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.990
<v Speaker 4>But what they bring you like is your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean</v>

1408
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.160
<v Speaker 3>obviously I'm come the town pool of </v>
<v Speaker 3>talented people.</v>

1409
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:24.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1410
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:27.480
<v Speaker 3>But even talented people occasionally </v>
<v Speaker 3>create turds</v>

1411
01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:28.680
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1412
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:31.390
<v Speaker 4>So if you're a crap shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that.</v>

1413
01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:34.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying there's different levels of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like what could you know,</v>

1414
01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:39.840
<v Speaker 4>what's got a better chance?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you bring something with a </v>

1415
01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:39.840
<v Speaker 4>vision and it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1416
01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.750
<v Speaker 4>like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're passionate about it.</v>

1417
01:02:40.751 --> 01:02:41.680
<v Speaker 4>I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1418
01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:46.000
<v Speaker 4>joe is bringing me this impassioned idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I think is funny.</v>

1419
01:02:46.270 --> 01:02:47.980
<v Speaker 4>I'll give them a pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing is about</v>

1420
01:02:48.050 --> 01:02:53.050
<v Speaker 3>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a really hard part about shows </v>

1421
01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:55.070
<v Speaker 3>you're developing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're developing them while you're </v>

1422
01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:56.030
<v Speaker 3>presenting them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like the show starts out,</v>

1423
01:02:56.031 --> 01:02:58.100
<v Speaker 3>it's a new show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to develop the characters,</v>

1424
01:02:58.101 --> 01:03:03.101
<v Speaker 3>you develop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they interact each other while </v>

1425
01:03:03.101 --> 01:03:03.101
<v Speaker 3>you're putting it on the air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you creating any,</v>

1426
01:03:03.101 --> 01:03:03.980
<v Speaker 3>putting on the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like as time goes on,</v>

1427
01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:07.850
<v Speaker 3>things get like you saw like Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in the later years or friends.</v>

1428
01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:10.150
<v Speaker 3>A perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knew the characters.</v>

1429
01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:15.160
<v Speaker 3>Everybody just flowed together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You knew even though there were a new </v>

1430
01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:15.860
<v Speaker 3>scripts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the thing was so established,</v>

1431
01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:18.140
<v Speaker 3>like what was funny about it and how it </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked.</v>

1432
01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:23.440
<v Speaker 3>When you're creating a new shell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're always like fire and peeling </v>

1433
01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:23.440
<v Speaker 3>that Kevin James Show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're,</v>

1434
01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.550
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they change out the swap out the wife,</v>

1435
01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:30.800
<v Speaker 3>like they did it on bewitched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get her out and bring a new one in and </v>

1436
01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:30.800
<v Speaker 3>you need a black neighbor and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1437
01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.130
<v Speaker 3>you need a gay friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then like,</v>

1438
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:33.470
<v Speaker 3>you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's not working,</v>

1439
01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.050
<v Speaker 3>everybody wants to throw their fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>ges into the soup mix.</v>

1440
01:03:36.051 --> 01:03:41.051
<v Speaker 3>Like I know the perfect thing this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>missing and that's what happens with </v>

1441
01:03:41.661 --> 01:03:42.680
<v Speaker 3>those shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1442
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:47.710
<v Speaker 3>They all just get looped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just get all these different </v>

1443
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:47.710
<v Speaker 3>opinions until they take out like South </v>
<v Speaker 3>Park,</v>

1444
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:48.950
<v Speaker 3>they don't listen to shit.</v>

1445
01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:54.280
<v Speaker 4>They'll listen to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's my point is that if you </v>

1446
01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:54.800
<v Speaker 4>comment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>major networks is different.</v>

1447
01:03:54.801 --> 01:03:57.080
<v Speaker 4>Like the cable networks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a little bit more leeway where</v>

1448
01:03:57.081 --> 01:03:58.430
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1449
01:03:58.431 --> 01:04:00.550
<v Speaker 4>if somebody comes in with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

1450
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:05.710
<v Speaker 4>if talent comes in with a strong idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a strong script and a strong vision </v>

1451
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:10.391
<v Speaker 4>and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's different with networks </v>

1452
01:04:10.391 --> 01:04:10.391
<v Speaker 4>you're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1453
01:04:10.391 --> 01:04:13.850
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of major show runners with an </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea and you know,</v>

1454
01:04:13.851 --> 01:04:16.520
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to fit into a formula </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's different.</v>

1455
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:19.670
<v Speaker 4>It's still hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's still hard,</v>

1456
01:04:19.671 --> 01:04:24.671
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying there's different </v>

1457
01:04:24.671 --> 01:04:24.671
<v Speaker 4>percentages of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1458
01:04:24.671 --> 01:04:24.671
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

1459
01:04:24.671 --> 01:04:24.671
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>South Park came in and they were like,</v>

1460
01:04:24.671 --> 01:04:25.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember stories where they were like,</v>

1461
01:04:25.551 --> 01:04:27.380
<v Speaker 4>they didn't get any notes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

1462
01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:28.880
<v Speaker 4>they don't even live here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>

1463
01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:30.530
<v Speaker 4>I think they live in Colorado or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1464
01:04:30.531 --> 01:04:31.130
<v Speaker 4>They were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1465
01:04:31.131 --> 01:04:33.220
<v Speaker 4>well we're gonna make this show and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1466
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:38.230
<v Speaker 4>stay the fuck away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably a good move from </v>

1467
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:41.831
<v Speaker 4>evergreen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like one of my favorite places </v>

1468
01:04:41.831 --> 01:04:41.831
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see the</v>

1469
01:04:41.831 --> 01:04:42.200
<v Speaker 3>original one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would Brian Boitano do?</v>

1470
01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:43.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

1471
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:48.190
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how they got started and that is </v>

1472
01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:50.501
<v Speaker 3>to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one of the funniest fucking thing </v>

1473
01:04:50.501 --> 01:04:50.501
<v Speaker 3>I've ever seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When someone gave him,</v>

1474
01:04:50.501 --> 01:04:53.090
<v Speaker 3>he was actually a girl I was dating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was an agent's assistant and she got</v>

1475
01:04:53.091 --> 01:04:55.410
<v Speaker 3>a vhs copy of it and she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1476
01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.460
<v Speaker 3>she brought it over my house and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>watched together.</v>

1477
01:04:57.470 --> 01:05:00.660
<v Speaker 3>We were fucking crying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just falling on the ground crying.</v>

1478
01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:01.580
<v Speaker 3>He was so silly.</v>

1479
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:03.710
<v Speaker 4>And Jesus versus Santa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1480
01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:05.690
<v Speaker 4>That was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't say thing.</v>

1481
01:05:05.691 --> 01:05:08.790
<v Speaker 4>I got the vhs tape in like 1996.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm to say.</v>

1482
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:11.570
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the time somewhere around there.</v>

1483
01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:13.640
<v Speaker 4>And I had that vhs and I would watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1484
01:05:13.641 --> 01:05:15.110
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is insane.</v>

1485
01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:16.850
<v Speaker 4>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1486
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.910
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

1487
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:23.400
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of funny because it's much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more shitty animation and drawing even </v>

1488
01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.240
<v Speaker 2>in the current one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is crazy hard to believe,</v>

1489
01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you watch it.</v>

1490
01:05:26.621 --> 01:05:31.621
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're watching like ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ancient cave art of Jesus or </v>

1491

1497
01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.480

<v Speaker 2>despicable me and that's what it is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

1516
01:06:30.161 --> 01:06:33.790
<v Speaker 2>That'd be super weird because some guys </v>

<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't like the minions.</v>

1522
01:06:46.091 --> 01:06:48.700
<v Speaker 2>One of those little fuckers like they </v>
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>

1523
01:06:48.701 --> 01:06:50.950
<v Speaker 2>The other guy grew to balance out </v>
<v Speaker 2>demands.</v>

1524
01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just have the minions.</v>

1525
01:06:52.331 --> 01:06:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Minions went rogue because it's just all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fucking assholes.</v>

1526
01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:57.610
<v Speaker 2>People didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found it.</v>

1527
01:06:57.850 --> 01:06:59.380
<v Speaker 2>I think it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed it.</v>

1528
01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:01.140
<v Speaker 2>I found it entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck them.</v>

1529
01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Fuck them Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1530
01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:05.920
<v Speaker 2>like toy story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>toy story three.</v>

1531
01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:07.840
<v Speaker 2>It was like one of the best movies I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever seen.</v>

1532
01:07:07.841 --> 01:07:09.040
<v Speaker 2>I started crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1533
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:10.060
<v Speaker 2>it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1534
01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.500
<v Speaker 2>I wept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1535
01:07:11.501 --> 01:07:15.100
<v Speaker 2>There were some dark moments when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>teddy bears trying to fucking throw them</v>

1536
01:07:15.101 --> 01:07:17.710
<v Speaker 2>into the incinerator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was intense.</v>

1537
01:07:17.711 --> 01:07:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Intense Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of air.</v>

1538
01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:24.450
<v Speaker 2>Lots of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever see babe the pep talking </v>

1539
01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:26.230
<v Speaker 2>pig moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see babe pig in the city?</v>

1540
01:07:26.231 --> 01:07:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Part Two?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I see that movie.</v>

1541
01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:34.660
<v Speaker 2>They decided to take the talking pig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like broad farm movie.</v>

1542
01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Throw them in the city where some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs are prostitutes.</v>

1543
01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:42.160
<v Speaker 2>It goes so fucking rogue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1544
01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:44.680
<v Speaker 2>You'll love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll text you and remind you.</v>

1545
01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1546
01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:50.300
<v Speaker 2>A pig in the city and there was a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>outrage because it was so like </v>

1547
01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.120
<v Speaker 2>aggressive and weirdly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's super dark and trippy.</v>

1548
01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:54.160
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big P there.</v>

1549
01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Prostitute dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God.</v>

1550
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:59.860
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the hooker dogs and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pink.</v>

1551
01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.900
<v Speaker 2>That is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got that Harlot.</v>

1552
01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:05.000
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1553
01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Weirder dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1554
01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.680
<v Speaker 2>They used to be wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They scare the shit out of me.</v>

1555
01:08:08.681 --> 01:08:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I figured out a way to turn them into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and have them live with us.</v>

1556
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.760
<v Speaker 2>I think about that when I'm around my </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog because my.</v>

1557
01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 2>I got a new dog recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven months old</v>

1558
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.980
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got him a few months back and he's a </v>

1559
01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:21.300
<v Speaker 3>golden retriever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1560
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:25.220
<v Speaker 3>It is the least wolf like dog that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever existed on the planet.</v>

1561
01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:28.190
<v Speaker 3>This dog has like zero aggression in </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

1562
01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:32.150
<v Speaker 3>Like even when he play fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like play,</v>

1563
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:34.940
<v Speaker 3>fight with another dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like zero threat of anybody getting</v>

1564
01:08:34.941 --> 01:08:36.810
<v Speaker 3>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's the,</v>

1565
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:42.010
<v Speaker 3>the mellowest comments and you gotta </v>
<v Speaker 3>think like somehow or another people </v>

1566
01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:47.051
<v Speaker 3>figured out how to take a wolf and </v>
<v Speaker 3>slowly whittle it down until you make </v>

1567
01:08:47.051 --> 01:08:47.260
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1568
01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.490
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was he eating?</v>

1569
01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:54.520
<v Speaker 3>They probably gave him some weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking shit and messed with his brain </v>

1570
01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:54.530
<v Speaker 3>denial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just breeding.</v>

1571
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:57.260
<v Speaker 3>They figured out a way where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1572
01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:02.440
<v Speaker 3>I think that life is crazy pliable and </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have the best chance of </v>

1573
01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:02.510
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1574
01:09:02.511 --> 01:09:07.511
<v Speaker 3>obviously this is not my theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but where life has the best chance of </v>

1575
01:09:07.511 --> 01:09:08.570
<v Speaker 3>success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kind of molds itself to that.</v>

1576
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:12.980
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's by putting people in colder</v>
<v Speaker 3>climates,</v>

1577
01:09:12.981 --> 01:09:17.981
<v Speaker 3>making their skin lighter so they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>more vitamin D because there's no sun </v>

1578
01:09:17.981 --> 01:09:21.761
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying it's atmosphere </v>

1579
01:09:21.761 --> 01:09:21.761
<v Speaker 3>related.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could be,</v>

1580
01:09:21.761 --> 01:09:24.580
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the atmosphere of a dog is the only </v>

1581
01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:24.580
<v Speaker 3>way that dog got food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had to be super cool with people,</v>

1582
01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:29.110
<v Speaker 3>so the dogs that were cool with people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are the ones that stuck around and they </v>

1583
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:30.170
<v Speaker 3>kept breeding and breeding and the ones </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are the coolest with the people,</v>

1584
01:09:30.171 --> 01:09:32.780
<v Speaker 3>the ones who got fed and the other one's</v>
<v Speaker 3>got shot and killed and he didn't get to</v>

1585
01:09:32.781 --> 01:09:37.781
<v Speaker 3>breed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's always like the ones that are </v>

1586
01:09:37.781 --> 01:09:39.681
<v Speaker 3>the coolest with the people that got </v>
<v Speaker 3>closer and closer to the campfire and </v>

1587
01:09:39.681 --> 01:09:40.490
<v Speaker 3>they get the scraps thrown their way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a sweet deal.</v>

1588
01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:45.700
<v Speaker 3>You Bark and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're cool with you and they give you </v>

1589
01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:48.341
<v Speaker 3>free food and you keep the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves and the bears from eating them </v>

1590
01:09:48.341 --> 01:09:48.341
<v Speaker 3>and you bark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bark,</v>

1591
01:09:48.341 --> 01:09:49.070
<v Speaker 3>bark when anything comes and they can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>alert.</v>

1592
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:54.070
<v Speaker 3>That was the whole deal with people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves and dogs and so they figured out </v>

1593
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:58.151
<v Speaker 3>a way over countless generations to turn</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wolf into this fucking dog like </v>

1594
01:09:58.151 --> 01:10:00.980
<v Speaker 3>into a poodle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they figured out how to do that and</v>

1595
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:03.770
<v Speaker 3>it's just life adapts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>

1596
01:10:03.771 --> 01:10:08.771
<v Speaker 3>Find some weird ways through and next </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing you know you're holding a French </v>

1597
01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:09.470
<v Speaker 3>bulldog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck?</v>

1598
01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:13.160
<v Speaker 3>That used to be a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A wolf got whittled down to.</v>

1599
01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No disrespect to French bulldogs.</v>

1600
01:10:15.201 --> 01:10:16.700
<v Speaker 3>They're adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love those little dogs,</v>

1601
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.950
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck did that even happen?</v>

1602
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never see like stone,</v>

1603
01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:23.450
<v Speaker 3>like cave drawings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The poodles that didn't exist.</v>

1604
01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:26.810
<v Speaker 3>It literally couldn't exist with perfect</v>
<v Speaker 3>pum pum,</v>

1605
01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:29.840
<v Speaker 3>like ankles and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what they found out about dogs,</v>

1606
01:10:29.841 --> 01:10:32.300
<v Speaker 3>it's really fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that all of them came from wolves.</v>

1607
01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.720
<v Speaker 3>They thought there was like that.</v>

1608
01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:37.220
<v Speaker 3>Like dogs came from like a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different wild canids,</v>

1609
01:10:37.221 --> 01:10:42.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of different like African dogs </v>

1610
01:10:42.221 --> 01:10:42.221
<v Speaker 3>and different dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

1611
01:10:42.221 --> 01:10:42.221
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of them came from wolves.</v>

1612
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:43.940
<v Speaker 3>All of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's super weird,</v>

1613
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:48.970
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then a wolf like fucked a frog or </v>

1614
01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:50.690
<v Speaker 3>something because there's no way a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking bulldog just comes from a wolf.</v>

1615
01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:55.780
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slowly but surely over thousands of </v>

1616
01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:56.840
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they turn a wolf into a bulldog.</v>

1617
01:10:57.530 --> 01:10:59.240
<v Speaker 3>Nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we going to go back to wolves?</v>

1618
01:10:59.241 --> 01:11:02.390
<v Speaker 3>Do you think we could turn into Jello </v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1619
01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:07.660
<v Speaker 3>We could turn into some cube like thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sits in a hard form that we carry </v>

1620
01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:11.561
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people found out human and you can't </v>

1621
01:11:11.561 --> 01:11:13.481
<v Speaker 3>break your bones if you don't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can move things telekinetically now </v>

1622
01:11:13.481 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 3>and everyone's going to fit into this </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking cube and we</v>

1623
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.020
<v Speaker 2>just would be this square thing with no </v>
<v Speaker 2>bones.</v>

1624
01:11:16.021 --> 01:11:21.021
<v Speaker 2>Just slops right into this just </v>
<v Speaker 2>indestructable plastic barrier that you </v>

1625
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:23.550
<v Speaker 2>carry around in life until you wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

1626
01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:28.820
<v Speaker 2>And then when you wanted to fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys would get close to the bed and </v>

1627
01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:29.520
<v Speaker 2>then you would just ooze out on top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

1628
01:11:29.521 --> 01:11:32.530
<v Speaker 2>You would like open your doors together </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just ooze on top of each other.</v>

1629
01:11:32.531 --> 01:11:36.440
<v Speaker 2>That's my entire family in Arkansas that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just described to that zip pills.</v>

1630
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:39.630
<v Speaker 2>It's everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got Them skittles.</v>

1631
01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:45.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dogs scare me because the dog bit my </v>

1632
01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:45.820
<v Speaker 2>balls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>

1633
01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:50.360
<v Speaker 2>I was playing with a ball in my front </v>
<v Speaker 2>yard and I'll never forget it and I </v>

1634
01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:53.211
<v Speaker 2>rounded third and a dog lashed out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>punctured my scrotum and I ran into the </v>

1635
01:11:53.211 --> 01:11:57.090
<v Speaker 2>house and I pulled my pants down and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mom started screaming and I just sit,</v>

1636
01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:01.770
<v Speaker 2>so dogs have always to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I walk past the dog,</v>

1637
01:12:01.771 --> 01:12:03.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm horrified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1638
01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

1639
01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not cool.</v>

1640
01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:08.160
<v Speaker 2>That ain't cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I won't be Jello Guy.</v>

1641
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1642
01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:13.500
<v Speaker 2>No worry about it's better path and </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting bitten then nuts by a dog.</v>

1643
01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have no Oregon's okay.</v>

1644
01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Nothing can break down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just a giant hive of tissue and </v>

1645
01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.180
<v Speaker 2>everything now is a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a dream that you can control.</v>

1646
01:12:24.181 --> 01:12:27.030
<v Speaker 2>They've gotten to the point where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't need a physical structure.</v>

1647
01:12:27.031 --> 01:12:29.820
<v Speaker 2>You don't need skulls and Oregon's and </v>
<v Speaker 2>livers,</v>

1648
01:12:29.821 --> 01:12:33.930
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff is handled exogenously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They bring in things.</v>

1649
01:12:33.931 --> 01:12:38.460
<v Speaker 2>They bring in like these connections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these tubes that link up to you and then</v>

1650
01:12:38.461 --> 01:12:41.730
<v Speaker 2>slowly our bodies devolved to the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have Oregon's anymore.</v>

1651
01:12:41.731 --> 01:12:46.731
<v Speaker 2>We rely on all our organ functions to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>handled outside of the body by machines </v>

1652
01:12:46.731 --> 01:12:51.111
<v Speaker 2>because it's way more efficient and </v>
<v Speaker 2>allows you to stay in the dream state </v>

1653
01:12:51.111 --> 01:12:51.111
<v Speaker 2>and control your life.</v>

1654
01:12:51.111 --> 01:12:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Do you have eyes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1655
01:12:52.221 --> 01:12:53.370
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no need.</v>

1656
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:58.280
<v Speaker 2>You see way better and the dream state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a mass of cells that somehow or</v>

1657
01:12:58.281 --> 01:13:01.830
<v Speaker 2>another contains consciousness that </v>
<v Speaker 2>interfaces with the dream state.</v>

1658
01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Twenty four slash seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I wear a hat?</v>

1659
01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:05.580
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

1660
01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:08.950
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a head like a hat on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>

1661
01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:10.980
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a Jello shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

1662
01:13:10.981 --> 01:13:12.840
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a lot of juice there.</v>

1663
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:17.870
<v Speaker 2>You want to be a big fat tube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a garbage dumpster filled with </v>

1664
01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:20.040
<v Speaker 2>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more cells,</v>

1665
01:13:20.041 --> 01:13:22.980
<v Speaker 2>maybe you have the more horsepower in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dream dimension,</v>

1666
01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:24.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how to make sense,</v>

1667
01:13:24.481 --> 01:13:29.481
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously what we're definitely </v>

1668
01:13:29.481 --> 01:13:29.940
<v Speaker 2>devolving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1669
01:13:29.941 --> 01:13:34.260
<v Speaker 2>If you go from like if you look at other</v>
<v Speaker 2>primates,</v>

1670
01:13:34.261 --> 01:13:38.640
<v Speaker 2>like primitive primates and you'll get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rang of tens and gorillas and they would</v>

1671
01:13:38.641 --> 01:13:41.100
<v Speaker 2>fuck us up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're so weak compared to them.</v>

1672
01:13:41.101 --> 01:13:46.101
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you were obviously like the </v>

1673
01:13:46.101 --> 01:13:47.700
<v Speaker 2>weakest by far of all the primates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than like little tiny monkeys.</v>

1674
01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1675
01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:54.020
<v Speaker 2>So by far our bodies have gotten weaker </v>
<v Speaker 2>and dozier and less capable and like our</v>

1676
01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:58.050
<v Speaker 2>tendons are not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are so much stronger than us.</v>

1677
01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:03.350
<v Speaker 2>So there's something that's happening to</v>
<v Speaker 2>our body was getting smolder and softer </v>

1678
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:04.290
<v Speaker 2>and weaker and they've a plant based </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>

1679
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:09.390
<v Speaker 2>just even gorillas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chimps eat the fuck out of everything </v>

1680
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:09.390
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They eat it,</v>

1681
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:11.190
<v Speaker 2>they're more closer to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're horrifying.</v>

1682
01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 2>That story about</v>

1683
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.980
<v Speaker 1>the guy who brought his chimp birthday </v>
<v Speaker 1>cake and the monkey attacked him and </v>

1684
01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:20.380
<v Speaker 1>then bit his nose off his fingers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ripped his penis off.</v>

1685
01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bite his fingers off.</v>

1686
01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:24.220
<v Speaker 1>But it's fingers did his fingers up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his nose.</v>

1687
01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:25.000
<v Speaker 1>You know the story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1688
01:14:25.001 --> 01:14:27.670
<v Speaker 1>The toward space apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was jealous.</v>

1689
01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:32.930
<v Speaker 1>The chimp that attacked him was jealous </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he brought a birthday cake to a </v>

1690
01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:35.851
<v Speaker 1>chimp that used to be his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the chimp used to be his and he </v>

1691
01:14:35.851 --> 01:14:37.510
<v Speaker 1>would say the worst is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the story?</v>

1692
01:14:37.810 --> 01:14:42.810
<v Speaker 1>The chimp used to be his and he brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chimp to a sanctuary when it got </v>

1693
01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:43.330
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because as they get older,</v>

1694
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:45.880
<v Speaker 1>they get super sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start biting people's fingers.</v>

1695
01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:51.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get super aggressive and the </v>

1696
01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:52.090
<v Speaker 1>consequences of them being aggressive or</v>
<v Speaker 1>so ferocious.</v>

1697
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't show me any pictures,</v>

1698
01:14:53.981 --> 01:14:55.480
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andi want to see it,</v>

1699
01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:57.300
<v Speaker 1>so he had to give up the champion.</v>

1700
01:14:57.310 --> 01:14:59.770
<v Speaker 1>The chimp loved him still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd go visit him on his birthday.</v>

1701
01:14:59.771 --> 01:15:01.540
<v Speaker 1>He brought him a cake with the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>

1702
01:15:01.541 --> 01:15:06.541
<v Speaker 1>saw the data and get a cake and someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up and left some doors open and </v>

1703
01:15:06.541 --> 01:15:08.500
<v Speaker 1>the chimps opened the doors and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked him up because he didn't give him</v>

1704
01:15:08.501 --> 01:15:10.960
<v Speaker 1>a cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all it was because he didn't give</v>

1705
01:15:10.961 --> 01:15:15.961
<v Speaker 1>him a cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tore his fingers off the towards </v>

1706
01:15:15.961 --> 01:15:15.961
<v Speaker 1>Dickoff just because they didn't give </v>
<v Speaker 1>him a cake.</v>

1707
01:15:15.961 --> 01:15:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Was that the idea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it because of the character?</v>

1708
01:15:18.751 --> 01:15:20.020
<v Speaker 1>Was it the fire?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1709
01:15:20.021 --> 01:15:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Fairness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1710
01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:21.240
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1711
01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:26.280
<v Speaker 1>It was a fairness issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were jealous that he gave the cake </v>

1712
01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:29.611
<v Speaker 1>to the one champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't get any cake and they were </v>

1713
01:15:29.611 --> 01:15:31.591
<v Speaker 1>fucking furious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're also dealing with these </v>

1714
01:15:31.591 --> 01:15:34.621
<v Speaker 1>chimps that are contained in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial environment that our freedom </v>

1715
01:15:34.621 --> 01:15:38.000
<v Speaker 1>and they want to lash out anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they directly associate people with </v>

1716
01:15:38.081 --> 01:15:39.310
<v Speaker 1>being their captors.</v>

1717
01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:44.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people are the ones that keep them </v>

1718
01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:44.880
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people,</v>

1719
01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:44.880
<v Speaker 1>the ones that feed on the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that control them.</v>

1720
01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:45.640
<v Speaker 1>And then if they can get out and fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

1721
01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.350
<v Speaker 1>the person doesn't give him a birthday </v>
<v Speaker 1>cake.</v>

1722
01:15:47.770 --> 01:15:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel like the worst aspects of people.</v>

1723
01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Magnified Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100.</v>

1724
01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd see it right in front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1725
01:15:54.761 --> 01:15:56.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we used to be.</v>

1726
01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:00.370
<v Speaker 1>This is how we got to 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be fucking ferocious.</v>

1727
01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:01.750
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1728
01:16:01.751 --> 01:16:03.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm just here to be like one with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

1729
01:16:03.671 --> 01:16:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Back in the days of like living with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jaguars and shit.</v>

1730
01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.470
<v Speaker 1>You had to Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to,</v>

1731
01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:10.180
<v Speaker 1>you had to literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1732
01:16:10.181 --> 01:16:15.181
<v Speaker 1>it was live or die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we think of like what we're </v>

1733
01:16:15.181 --> 01:16:16.810
<v Speaker 1>becoming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're obviously becoming more passive.</v>

1734
01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:21.340
<v Speaker 1>We're becoming more better able to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1735
01:16:21.341 --> 01:16:22.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with each other,</v>

1736
01:16:22.691 --> 01:16:24.990
<v Speaker 1>without violence and that all that.</v>

1737
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:28.600
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff makes us mushier all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1738
01:16:28.601 --> 01:16:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Is this making more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even a week.</v>

1739
01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:35.200
<v Speaker 1>It's just like physically not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not attuned to violence.</v>

1740
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for physically not attuned to vote,</v>

1741
01:16:37.591 --> 01:16:39.550
<v Speaker 1>why do we need all the strength?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why do you,</v>

1742
01:16:39.551 --> 01:16:41.380
<v Speaker 1>why do you need to be so fast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was trying to kill you,</v>

1743
01:16:41.381 --> 01:16:43.300
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sit in a cubicle all day.</v>

1744
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:47.770
<v Speaker 1>So everything just starts to just like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bulldog their face.</v>

1745
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Somehow they figured out to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

1746
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll flat or whole body's going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1747
01:16:52.061 --> 01:16:53.650
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to just flatten out.</v>

1748
01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:54.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1749
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:56.260
<v Speaker 1>and then our body's going to absorb the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bones.</v>

1750
01:16:56.290 --> 01:16:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Once we start like encasing ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'd go back to the Jello.</v>

1751
01:16:59.951 --> 01:17:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Paypal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1752
01:17:00.701 --> 01:17:02.680
<v Speaker 1>You realize you don't even need food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You work like a,</v>

1753
01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.560
<v Speaker 1>like a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have this,</v>

1754
01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:09.460
<v Speaker 1>this box that contains you and it uses </v>
<v Speaker 1>photosynthesis.</v>

1755
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.500
<v Speaker 3>Fuel your cells don't like water and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1756
01:17:12.501 --> 01:17:14.480
<v Speaker 3>Just like soil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He needs some soil.</v>

1757
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:16.610
<v Speaker 3>You're going to put some soil below.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be a plant.</v>

1758
01:17:16.611 --> 01:17:20.270
<v Speaker 3>You're going to go back to plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck plants in the Matrix.</v>

1759
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.760
<v Speaker 3>Like in a week now I'll take a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

1760
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:24.260
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 million years or so.</v>

1761
01:17:24.261 --> 01:17:29.261
<v Speaker 3>It will definitely be like some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a gigantic organism connected to some,</v>

1762
01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:35.140
<v Speaker 3>probably some natural internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what they'll do with their </v>

1763
01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:37.841
<v Speaker 3>figure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll get to a point where they're </v>

1764
01:17:37.841 --> 01:17:37.841
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1765
01:17:37.841 --> 01:17:39.671
<v Speaker 3>this regular Internet is too unreliable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're constantly relying on these </v>

1766
01:17:39.671 --> 01:17:40.160
<v Speaker 3>cables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a new idea.</v>

1767
01:17:40.190 --> 01:17:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Here's my new idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are going to make an internet by </v>

1768
01:17:45.190 --> 01:17:47.660
<v Speaker 3>going into all these plants and </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetically engineering them and turning</v>

1769
01:17:47.661 --> 01:17:52.661
<v Speaker 3>them into Wifi towers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everything is a wifi tower and this </v>

1770
01:17:52.661 --> 01:17:56.681
<v Speaker 3>is the new Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all connected with each other </v>

1771
01:17:56.681 --> 01:17:57.380
<v Speaker 3>and you through using a computer or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cell phone or whatever,</v>

1772
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:59.930
<v Speaker 3>you're interfacing with nature now.</v>

1773
01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:04.250
<v Speaker 3>You're no longer interfacing with some </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial servers and the verizon,</v>

1774
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:09.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking throttling your data because </v>

1775
01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:09.550
<v Speaker 3>they don't like using Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1776
01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:09.550
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1777
01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:09.550
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1778
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:14.950
<v Speaker 3>Now you're dealing with re-engineered </v>
<v Speaker 3>plants where plants are now the </v>

1779
01:18:15.171 --> 01:18:20.171
<v Speaker 3>distributors of information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't Tevye Tevye Bro,</v>

1780
01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:25.840
<v Speaker 3>but it might be real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they know that plants talk to </v>

1781
01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.601
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a hundred percent certain of </v>

1782
01:18:28.601 --> 01:18:30.200
<v Speaker 3>the prince plants allocate resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have this whole,</v>

1783
01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:31.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>underlying,</v>

1784
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:33.560
<v Speaker 3>like there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a whole,</v>

1785
01:18:33.561 --> 01:18:38.450
<v Speaker 3>almost like an internet of mycelium and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like fungus and all this different shit.</v>

1786
01:18:38.451 --> 01:18:43.451
<v Speaker 3>All their network of their root system </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything that they communicate </v>

1787
01:18:43.451 --> 01:18:45.350
<v Speaker 3>with each other about what we don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

1788
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:49.490
<v Speaker 3>We know that they do certain things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>plants here,</v>

1789
01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:54.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other plants getting eaten and they </v>

1790
01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:54.560
<v Speaker 3>changed their flavor profile and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>become toxic.</v>

1791
01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:56.870
<v Speaker 3>They have like a terrible toxic taste to</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1792
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Wet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1793
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:59.860
<v Speaker 3>giraffes do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not always.</v>

1794
01:18:59.861 --> 01:19:04.861
<v Speaker 3>It's works or not drops of eucalyptus </v>
<v Speaker 3>trees do that when drafts are eating </v>

1795
01:19:04.861 --> 01:19:07.130
<v Speaker 3>them and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of different trees.</v>

1796
01:19:07.131 --> 01:19:09.320
<v Speaker 3>They've shown that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only can they,</v>

1797
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:13.430
<v Speaker 3>this is the craziest study they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only is it not knowing for sure that</v>

1798
01:19:13.431 --> 01:19:15.980
<v Speaker 3>these plants are being eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they hear it.</v>

1799
01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:21.100
<v Speaker 3>So they played recordings of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>crunching recordings of Caterpillar is </v>

1800
01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:24.761
<v Speaker 3>eating leaves and they've played it next</v>
<v Speaker 3>to these trees and the trees altered </v>

1801
01:19:24.761 --> 01:19:29.111
<v Speaker 3>their profile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They started reading some sort of a </v>

1802
01:19:29.111 --> 01:19:29.480
<v Speaker 3>chemical that makes their leaves taste </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>

1803
01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:33.200
<v Speaker 3>So what they found is like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if it'll happen in Africa,</v>

1804
01:19:33.201 --> 01:19:36.350
<v Speaker 3>we're one plant will be thanks to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Acacia tree.</v>

1805
01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:37.970
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is right.</v>

1806
01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The occasional one that changes,</v>

1807
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:45.110
<v Speaker 3>it's not eucalyptus is the Acacia tree </v>
<v Speaker 3>and one animal will be eating it.</v>

1808
01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.530
<v Speaker 3>The other animals catch wind that </v>
<v Speaker 3>something's eating it and they literally</v>

1809
01:19:48.531 --> 01:19:53.531
<v Speaker 3>become toxic to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They taste like shit and so they won't </v>

1810
01:19:53.531 --> 01:19:57.311
<v Speaker 3>eat it and they'll starve to death </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than eat the plants some crazy </v>

1811
01:19:57.311 --> 01:19:58.910
<v Speaker 3>chemical strategy and they communicate </v>
<v Speaker 3>with each other.</v>

1812
01:19:58.911 --> 01:20:02.510
<v Speaker 3>That's how they find out that this other</v>
<v Speaker 3>plant is getting eaten.</v>

1813
01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:05.930
<v Speaker 3>It goes through the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have this fiber of Jesus.</v>

1814
01:20:06.150 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 3>It goes to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have this fiber</v>

1815
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.980
<v Speaker 1>of all these different organic things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like like fungus and mushrooms and shit.</v>

1816
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:16.380
<v Speaker 1>They're communicating with the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1817
01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:20.580
<v Speaker 1>That is amazing to think that like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't even hear it.</v>

1818
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:25.790
<v Speaker 1>The allocate resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like figure out a way to </v>

1819
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:29.571
<v Speaker 1>allocate resources towards plants that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are connected to them that are more </v>

1820
01:20:29.571 --> 01:20:30.150
<v Speaker 1>needy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very bizarre.</v>

1821
01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.590
<v Speaker 1>We totally don't know why they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We taught me,</v>

1822
01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:35.730
<v Speaker 1>we don't know how they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all some new thing over the last 20</v>

1823
01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:40.230
<v Speaker 1>years that people are beginning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out that these plants are somehow</v>

1824
01:20:40.231 --> 01:20:45.231
<v Speaker 1>or another interacting with each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe interacting with their </v>

1825
01:20:45.231 --> 01:20:45.540
<v Speaker 1>environment a way that we just don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand yet.</v>

1826
01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:47.130
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1827
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:52.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean they might be conscious and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>some way we just don't imagine we can't </v>

1828
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.910
<v Speaker 1>imagine it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1829
01:20:53.010 --> 01:20:54.320
<v Speaker 1>But there might be some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1830
01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think of consciousness as like,</v>

1831
01:20:56.161 --> 01:21:01.161
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to the store to do a </v>

1832
01:21:01.161 --> 01:21:01.161
<v Speaker 1>set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1833
01:21:01.161 --> 01:21:01.161
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1834
01:21:01.161 --> 01:21:01.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go take my girl to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

1835
01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:03.090
<v Speaker 1>That fucking planet of the apes thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks sweet,</v>

1836
01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:08.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we think of as </v>

1837
01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:08.380
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every day I do that.</v>

1838
01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:09.960
<v Speaker 1>But without language and whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck plants use for communicating,</v>

1839
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:13.470
<v Speaker 1>it might be some sort of a weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that they have the,</v>

1840
01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:18.530
<v Speaker 1>we don't even perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we could even have classified that </v>

1841
01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:18.530
<v Speaker 1>as language could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

1842
01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1843
01:21:19.171 --> 01:21:24.171
<v Speaker 1>I'm just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking shit while I'm hydro right </v>

1844
01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:28.710
<v Speaker 1>time asking questions because I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to figure out what to have a more </v>

1845
01:21:30.841 --> 01:21:35.841
<v Speaker 1>plant based diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want motherfuckers </v>

1846
01:21:35.841 --> 01:21:35.841
<v Speaker 1>whispering and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1847
01:21:35.841 --> 01:21:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Like donate careless whispers in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cauliflower.</v>

1848
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Mark somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe they like to eat them because </v>

1849
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.540
<v Speaker 1>they didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eat them.</v>

1850
01:21:45.690 --> 01:21:47.310
<v Speaker 1>How come when you shit out there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeds.</v>

1851
01:21:47.311 --> 01:21:50.070
<v Speaker 1>That's how plants get distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1852
01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:55.071
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also how do they know what tastes like </v>

1853
01:21:55.071 --> 01:21:55.071
<v Speaker 1>shit to us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're altering how it tastes,</v>

1854
01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:58.380
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to get us to eat it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just trying to make it better for</v>

1855
01:21:58.381 --> 01:21:59.910
<v Speaker 1>us to eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're like,</v>

1856
01:21:59.911 --> 01:22:01.890
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe oh he's eating mark.</v>

1857
01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll fucking create a new spice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it'll be better and he'll eat </v>

1858
01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:07.920
<v Speaker 1>me faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some shit.</v>

1859
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Hence peaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why pizza so delicious to try and trick </v>

1860
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:15.030
<v Speaker 1>you into eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you shit out one of those pits,</v>

1861
01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:19.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get some nice nutritious shit,</v>

1862
01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:21.380
<v Speaker 1>especially if you've been eating nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>but peaches,</v>

1863
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:24.780
<v Speaker 1>your shit would probably be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Primo for growing a peach.</v>

1864
01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Just ready for an s and m dungeon.</v>

1865
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:32.360
<v Speaker 1>You're out there in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take a massive dump with a bunch of </v>

1866
01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:35.121
<v Speaker 1>peach pits in it and they fertilized and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then a new peach tree grows and this </v>

1867
01:22:35.191 --> 01:22:37.500
<v Speaker 1>one's even better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It talks to you in a deep,</v>

1868
01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:42.870
<v Speaker 1>slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a wolf becoming a French </v>

1869
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:45.051
<v Speaker 1>bulldog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The peaches become sweeter and sweeter </v>

1870
01:22:45.051 --> 01:22:45.051
<v Speaker 1>and sweeter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then even we get in the mix like,</v>

1871
01:22:45.051 --> 01:22:49.761
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole peach sweeten and shit just </v>

1872
01:22:49.761 --> 01:22:50.550
<v Speaker 1>seeing happening fast enough for me like</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and my boys Monsanto,</v>

1873
01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:55.640
<v Speaker 1>we brought scalpels and laser beams and </v>
<v Speaker 1>birth control pills and we're going to </v>

1874
01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:57.960
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to get these peaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Sweet.</v>

1875
01:22:57.961 --> 01:23:00.450
<v Speaker 1>And they last for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1876
01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what if you'd take a shit and the </v>

1877
01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:07.131
<v Speaker 1>tree grows and it's not pages and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's shit the shit.</v>

1878
01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.150
<v Speaker 1>And you can't hack that square.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what ends up happening.</v>

1879
01:23:10.530 --> 01:23:13.360
<v Speaker 1>The peaches get so sweet that they turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>into shit.</v>

1880
01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1881
01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:16.300
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the world I want to live in.</v>

1882
01:23:16.301 --> 01:23:18.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like you fix it until you break it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1883
01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.950
<v Speaker 1>You fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tried to sweet.</v>

1884
01:23:21.010 --> 01:23:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Try to get the peaches to sweet and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to the point of grady nature </v>

1885
01:23:26.010 --> 01:23:26.010
<v Speaker 1>rebelled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1886
01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.150
<v Speaker 1>so that's the argument for diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1887
01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:33.570
<v Speaker 1>The reason why there's so many diseases </v>
<v Speaker 1>for human beings is that there's just </v>

1888
01:23:33.570 --> 01:23:33.570
<v Speaker 1>too many of us in nature's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1889
01:23:33.570 --> 01:23:33.660
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1890
01:23:33.661 --> 01:23:34.030
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1891
01:23:34.031 --> 01:23:34.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1892
01:23:34.331 --> 01:23:39.331
<v Speaker 1>You can't just do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just have 7 billion of one </v>

1893
01:23:39.331 --> 01:23:39.331
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking stupid.</v>

1894
01:23:39.331 --> 01:23:40.720
<v Speaker 1>We've got to kill some of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1895
01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:41.700
<v Speaker 1>we kind of figured out a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1896
01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:43.820
<v Speaker 1>we got like plague and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

1897
01:23:43.821 --> 01:23:44.440
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1898
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1899
01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:45.980
<v Speaker 1>We got injections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna.</v>

1900
01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Kill all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we're going to keep battling </v>

1901
01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:51.010
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One step ahead.</v>

1902
01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Diseases and scientists are going to war</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday on the front lines.</v>

1903
01:23:54.690 --> 01:23:56.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's going on,</v>

1904
01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:57.120
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nature is trying to.</v>

1905
01:23:57.121 --> 01:24:02.121
<v Speaker 2>Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think they just trying to pull </v>

1906
01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:02.121
<v Speaker 2>their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're pulling the plug on us.</v>

1907
01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:03.120
<v Speaker 2>What was the last time you dog</v>

1908
01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:04.960
<v Speaker 1>sick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a dog.</v>

1909
01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:06.580
<v Speaker 1>If you have a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what you do.</v>

1910
01:24:06.581 --> 01:24:10.090
<v Speaker 1>You give your dog a Parvo shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get distemper,</v>

1911
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:15.270
<v Speaker 1>they get rabies and they're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go around eating everything they </v>

1912
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:16.000
<v Speaker 1>find licking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>licking everything,</v>

1913
01:24:16.001 --> 01:24:19.210
<v Speaker 1>pissing on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What percentage of dogs get sick?</v>

1914
01:24:19.211 --> 01:24:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Is it even one was the dogs that get </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer?</v>

1915
01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:25.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can happen,</v>

1916
01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:30.280
<v Speaker 1>but like dogs getting cold weather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When does your dog gets sick?</v>

1917
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Your dog starts sneezing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hold the fuck Outta here at dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get my dogs.</v>

1920
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:36.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if he did,</v>

1921
01:24:36.990 --> 01:24:39.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've never heard of a dog getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>it like a sinus infection.</v>

1922
01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.770
<v Speaker 2>They happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They happen when those bulldogs for sure</v>

1923
01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:47.890
<v Speaker 2>they get all fucked up because their </v>
<v Speaker 2>noses only like a half an inch long </v>

1924
01:24:47.890 --> 01:24:48.500
<v Speaker 2>where they have upper respiratory like </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible problems.</v>

1925
01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:51.560
<v Speaker 2>I have friends that are bulldogs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they said it's a fucking nightmare.</v>

1926
01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.540
<v Speaker 2>One of my dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half bulldog.</v>

1927
01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:59.050
<v Speaker 2>He's half bull dog and half Shiba Inu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's got like a little bit of a </v>

1928
01:24:59.050 --> 01:25:00.450
<v Speaker 2>longer face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watches that star wars character.</v>

1929

<v Speaker 2>What is the sheep dog?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

01:25:44.211 --> 01:25:46.640
<v Speaker 2>That's why I got him because he looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that when he was a baby.</v>

1946
01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:48.470
<v Speaker 2>That's what your dog looks like a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

1947
01:25:48.471 --> 01:25:50.150
<v Speaker 2>Basically a little more bulldog to them.</v>

1948
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Tell it her eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about dogs,</v>

1949
01:25:53.671 --> 01:25:55.320
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just stayed very so much.</v>

1950
01:25:55.321 --> 01:25:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Personality wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a trip.</v>

1951
01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.880
<v Speaker 1>You could have three dogs from the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>litter and one of them's just a totally </v>

1952
01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:01.880
<v Speaker 1>different kind of dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other ones,</v>

1953
01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 1>like when they get dogs for police dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

1954
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:07.520
<v Speaker 1>they never know like what dog's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how they're going to come out.</v>

1955
01:26:07.521 --> 01:26:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Like you look for a specific type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

1956
01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:12.920
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know why he's like good </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood lines and everything like that.</v>

1957
01:26:12.921 --> 01:26:17.921
<v Speaker 1>But out of illiterate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not 100 percent even in a good </v>

1958
01:26:17.921 --> 01:26:17.921
<v Speaker 1>bloodline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're normally what kind of</v>

1959
01:26:17.921 --> 01:26:18.680
<v Speaker 4>police dogs are never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1960
01:26:18.850 --> 01:26:21.800
<v Speaker 4>there are specific,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like German shepherds are.</v>

1961
01:26:21.801 --> 01:26:22.220
<v Speaker 4>What are they?</v>

1962
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a bunch of different dogs.</v>

1963
01:26:24.021 --> 01:26:26.120
<v Speaker 1>They use Belgian malinois are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

1964
01:26:26.121 --> 01:26:29.630
<v Speaker 1>but those are super hard to control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The golden doodle get attack dog.</v>

1965
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:35.110
<v Speaker 1>They're real good attack dogs like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second sick on people that like very </v>

1966
01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:37.640
<v Speaker 1>effective because they're super hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive and they'll just go right for</v>

1967
01:26:37.641 --> 01:26:41.720
<v Speaker 1>your throat and fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use those a lot in military,</v>

1968
01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:43.220
<v Speaker 1>what they would call the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater.</v>

1969
01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

1970
01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.920

<v Speaker 1>They'll say that military theater,</v>

1971
01:26:48.921 --> 01:26:53.921
<v Speaker 1>military theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said that starting closing at </v>

1972
01:26:53.921 --> 01:26:55.100
<v Speaker 1>seven and then it's like a way to sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter than you really are.</v>

1973
01:26:55.101 --> 01:26:57.140
<v Speaker 1>If you said using something in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>military theater,</v>

01:28:40.130 --> 01:28:42.140
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out what was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I couldn't because they were </v>

2011
01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:42.660
<v Speaker 4>escorted out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then afterwards they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a fight.</v>

2031
01:29:35.551 --> 01:29:40.551
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion of musicals and a lot of is </v>

2032
01:29:40.551 --> 01:29:43.071
<v Speaker 2>based on a girl that I dated when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>18 who made me go to see cats with her </v>

<v Speaker 2>you don't have any fucking patience for </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2035
01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:46.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2036

<v Speaker 2>Definitely don't have any paid two years</v>

2037
01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:51.610
<v Speaker 2>old musical people that are dressing up.</v>

2038
01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:52.900
<v Speaker 2>It is playing somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

2039
01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Where's it playing on Broadway apparent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Lloyd Webber's.</v>

2040
01:29:56.821 --> 01:29:59.670
<v Speaker 2>Long running classic is back on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Broadway.</v>

2041
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.990
<v Speaker 2>Exclamation point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean from Caroline's.</v>

2042
01:30:03.991 --> 01:30:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2043
01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:09.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to diss it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last time I saw it was 30 fucking years </v>

2044
01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:09.680
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>32 years ago almost.</v>

2045
01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still cats have not evolved.</v>

2046
01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.270
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I need to go now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go.</v>

2047
01:30:14.271 --> 01:30:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

2048
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Build lasted like seven stars of death </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep and we should eat first like hey,</v>

2049
01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:25.890
<v Speaker 2>take the stars of death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like full on.</v>

2050
01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Take five stars of death and then have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>stake.</v>

2051
01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:34.400
<v Speaker 2>So this is my thought process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're sitting in a restaurant like </v>

2052
01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:34.410
<v Speaker 2>right after you order it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

2053
01:30:34.411 --> 01:30:35.430
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do this.</v>

2054
01:30:35.710 --> 01:30:40.710
<v Speaker 2>You dumped this stars of death down your</v>
<v Speaker 2>system and then the food starts coming </v>

2055
01:30:40.710 --> 01:30:44.840
<v Speaker 2>so the food piles on your body has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle to digest the star and all the </v>

2056
01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.370
<v Speaker 2>fat from your food like steak and mashed</v>
<v Speaker 2>potatoes.</v>

2057
01:30:47.370 --> 01:30:50.260
<v Speaker 2>If you're feeling non quito and as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get it gets cooked.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They probably had draw strings.</v>

2119
01:33:29.471 --> 01:33:31.720
<v Speaker 1>They probably didn't even have like </v>
<v Speaker 1>rubber waistbands back then.</v>

2120

2127
01:33:54.481 --> 01:33:56.971
<v Speaker 1>then probably somebody did terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to them and they went to school </v>

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.840
<v Speaker 4>Construction jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you'd have to make concrete so</v>

2172
01:35:53.841 --> 01:35:55.910
<v Speaker 4>you have to pour the shit and pour the </v>
<v Speaker 4>water and mix it.</v>

2173
01:35:56.260 --> 01:36:01.260
<v Speaker 4>You have to mix it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this big old fucking plastic tub </v>

2174
01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:04.061
<v Speaker 4>that was a lot like a big litter box and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could just do that just to get one </v>

2175
01:36:04.061 --> 01:36:04.940
<v Speaker 4>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cement mix and tubs could.</v>

2176
01:36:04.941 --> 01:36:08.720
<v Speaker 4>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to do that.</v>

2177
01:36:08.721 --> 01:36:11.210
<v Speaker 4>I want to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you get thousands of people,</v>

2178
01:36:11.211 --> 01:36:13.850
<v Speaker 4>I would get into a furry outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get fucked,</v>

2179
01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:17.240
<v Speaker 4>but would you be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who would I be?</v>

2180
01:36:17.290 --> 01:36:18.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be a furry.</v>

2181
01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:19.990
<v Speaker 4>Like what creature would you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2182
01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:21.500
<v Speaker 4>what do you feel like your spirit animal</v>
<v Speaker 4>is?</v>

2183
01:36:21.501 --> 01:36:23.990
<v Speaker 4>Nick?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good question.</v>

2184
01:36:27.490 --> 01:36:28.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>

2185
01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:33.680
<v Speaker 4>Do you think you're a monkey or wolf?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say a monkey over a wolf if </v>

2186
01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:34.820
<v Speaker 4>those are the options.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2187
01:36:34.821 --> 01:36:39.821
<v Speaker 4>So we're moving more towards monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to get like a taste </v>

2188
01:36:39.821 --> 01:36:39.821
<v Speaker 4>palate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a series of questions that I use to</v>

2189
01:36:39.821 --> 01:36:40.880
<v Speaker 4>determine which one will be best for </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2190
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:43.430
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say a squirrel.</v>

2191
01:36:43.670 --> 01:36:44.870
<v Speaker 4>Squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2192
01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:47.510
<v Speaker 4>Like you already midwest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are rat,</v>

2193
01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:49.370
<v Speaker 4>but your tail is so cute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We let it slide.</v>

2194
01:36:49.590 --> 01:36:51.860
<v Speaker 4>Plus you only eat nuts and plants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2195
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:55.300
<v Speaker 4>Rats eat everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2196
01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:57.290
<v Speaker 4>Sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2197
01:36:57.291 --> 01:36:59.990
<v Speaker 4>Rats or just can't be trusted carrying </v>
<v Speaker 4>diseases.</v>

2198
01:36:59.991 --> 01:37:04.991
<v Speaker 4>Squirrels are chill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to hang out with girls in New </v>

2199
01:37:04.991 --> 01:37:07.510
<v Speaker 4>York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would go into a union square and I </v>

2200
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:10.970
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't get up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw a guy get a bag of nuts and I </v>

2201
01:37:10.970 --> 01:37:13.721
<v Speaker 4>watched him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would sit in the middle of the park </v>

2202
01:37:13.721 --> 01:37:13.721
<v Speaker 4>and the squirrels would come and crawl </v>
<v Speaker 4>on him and he would put the,</v>

2203
01:37:13.721 --> 01:37:16.980
<v Speaker 4>he would put a nut in his fist and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>squirrels would reach in like,</v>

2204
01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:20.030
<v Speaker 4>like it was like a little hole and pull </v>
<v Speaker 4>those out and eat it on his arm.</v>

2205
01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:22.550
<v Speaker 4>So I studied this guy for weeks and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

2206
01:37:22.551 --> 01:37:27.551
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to fucking do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I go and I get a bag of nuts and I </v>

2207
01:37:27.551 --> 01:37:30.581
<v Speaker 4>got the courage up and I got into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle of the park and I sat there and </v>

2208
01:37:30.581 --> 01:37:33.851
<v Speaker 4>the squirrels started coming on me and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>started getting panicky but you can't </v>

2209
01:37:33.851 --> 01:37:37.721
<v Speaker 4>panic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I zoned out and then the squirrels </v>

2210
01:37:37.721 --> 01:37:39.110
<v Speaker 4>started feeding out of my hands and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>started becoming squirrel man.</v>

2211
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:41.480
<v Speaker 4>And then I started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to show my friends.</v>

2212
01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:45.800
<v Speaker 4>So I bring my buddies and the like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like to the park with me and I'm like,</v>

2213
01:37:45.801 --> 01:37:47.330
<v Speaker 4>watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they'd be like,</v>

2214
01:37:47.331 --> 01:37:49.610
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

2215
01:37:49.611 --> 01:37:51.450
<v Speaker 4>watching this girls will be on my arms </v>
<v Speaker 4>and stuff.</v>

2216
01:37:51.451 --> 01:37:52.910
<v Speaker 4>And my friends were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2217
01:37:52.911 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm not on board with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody thought it was cool.</v>

2218
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.100
<v Speaker 1>It just thought I was like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete lunatic.</v>

2219
01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:00.930
<v Speaker 1>And I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like this.</v>

2220
01:38:00.931 --> 01:38:02.840
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like an x men or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2221
01:38:03.450 --> 01:38:07.380
<v Speaker 1>I had gotten this like power that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialed into like a whole.</v>

2222
01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:09.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He became like a beastmaster.</v>

2223
01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was rad.</v>

2224
01:38:10.891 --> 01:38:12.140
<v Speaker 1>But you remember that show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2225
01:38:12.141 --> 01:38:17.141
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The duties to be able to tell animals </v>

2226
01:38:17.141 --> 01:38:19.140
<v Speaker 1>what to do and they all listen to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the shit fucking ripped.</v>

2227
01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:21.750
<v Speaker 1>The one thing she could remake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fucking doubt.</v>

2228
01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:25.650
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a sweet remake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know 100 percent.</v>

2229
01:38:25.651 --> 01:38:28.170
<v Speaker 1>You should be the beastmaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You or me?</v>

2230
01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:29.880
<v Speaker 1>We could be beastmaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could do it.</v>

2231
01:38:29.881 --> 01:38:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Brothers and sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beastmaster need a bunch of chicks to.</v>

2232
01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:35.730
<v Speaker 1>We gotta you gotTa have diversity today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to pitch a show,</v>

2233
01:38:35.970 --> 01:38:40.920
<v Speaker 1>we should have at least one black female</v>
<v Speaker 1>trans beastmaster look at them.</v>

2234
01:38:41.970 --> 01:38:44.310
<v Speaker 1>That seems like the newer version of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>master.</v>

2235
01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Is that the original beastmaster?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

2312
01:42:57.641 --> 01:43:01.181
<v Speaker 2>Kim Milford.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cheryl Smith was probably hot as fuck </v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean it was 1978.</v>

2316
01:43:04.761 --> 01:43:05.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they were.</v>

2317
01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:10.340
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you had a choice back </v>

2318
01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:10.340
<v Speaker 2>then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:10.340
<v Speaker 2>they made you do coke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They punched in your face after you when</v>

2320
01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:11.930
<v Speaker 2>you were born and you had to wear bell </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottoms.</v>

2321
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:14.570
<v Speaker 2>This is the beginning of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude's like,</v>

2322
01:43:14.571 --> 01:43:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>

2323
01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.360
<v Speaker 2>Like this movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fucking stupid.</v>

2324
01:43:17.361 --> 01:43:18.200
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2325
01:43:18.201 --> 01:43:23.160
<v Speaker 2>just walking through boiling hot shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>desert.</v>

2326
01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:26.900
<v Speaker 2>So I think this is like the alien with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun.</v>

2327
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:28.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's save it until we wait.</v>

2328
01:43:28.610 --> 01:43:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2329
01:43:29.181 --> 01:43:30.950
<v Speaker 2>That's what we watched and we'll save </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2330
01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2331
01:43:31.820 --> 01:43:34.460
<v Speaker 2>This is the original alien that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

2332
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.000
<v Speaker 2>that's what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that guy dies and leaves him the </v>

2333
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.170
<v Speaker 2>gun boiler alert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm wrong.</v>

2334
01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:44.600
<v Speaker 2>I thought that that guy was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beastmaster guy,</v>

2335
01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:50.320
<v Speaker 2>but beastmaster doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were still turned onto a gem with </v>

2336
01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:50.630
<v Speaker 2>laser blast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad I remembered that.</v>

2337
01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't how I remembered that.</v>

2338
01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:57.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how the fuck that's still </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my brain because I haven't seen that </v>

2339
01:43:57.910 --> 01:44:01.091
<v Speaker 1>movie and I probably haven't seen it </v>
<v Speaker 1>since like a year after I watched the </v>

2340
01:44:01.091 --> 01:44:02.860
<v Speaker 1>first sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that singer he was in,</v>

2341
01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:04.970
<v Speaker 1>he was in some movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>played a blind guy.</v>

2342
01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:07.580
<v Speaker 1>That guy's been in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2343
01:44:07.870 --> 01:44:10.370
<v Speaker 1>He was a teen wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kissing a dude.</v>

2344
01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:11.960
<v Speaker 1>What's that all about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cut that out.</v>

2345
01:44:13.110 --> 01:44:16.490
<v Speaker 1>A beauty and the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going Lrg on that.</v>

2346
01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in.</v>

2347
01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:19.700
<v Speaker 1>That guy's got a gang of movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did,</v>

2348
01:44:20.210 --> 01:44:24.560
<v Speaker 1>but also peace master and the young and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the restless.</v>

2349
01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:27.620
<v Speaker 1>If you had a beastmaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it.</v>

2350
01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Would people think it was racist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you hired a black guy,</v>

2351
01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:37.360
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had a guy that could talk to </v>

2352
01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:38.600
<v Speaker 1>monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously he's a white guy.</v>

2353
01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:43.930
<v Speaker 1>If it's a white guy in the white guy can</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk into the forest falcons land on </v>

2354
01:44:43.930 --> 01:44:45.620
<v Speaker 1>them and fucking drafts come up to him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he gives him an apple and shit.</v>

2355
01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's cool with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you had a black guy like jet </v>

2356
01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:54.581
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wesley Snipes Black and he's walking </v>

2357

<v Speaker 1>through the jungle and all the animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>flocked to him and he,</v>

2358
01:44:55.951 --> 01:44:57.890
<v Speaker 1>he had the monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they talk to each other.</v>

2359
01:44:57.891 --> 01:45:02.770
<v Speaker 1>He tells the monkeys what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will be like no fucking way.</v>

2360
01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:08.680
<v Speaker 1>That is so racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you saying that black people are </v>

2361
01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.880
<v Speaker 1>like closer to these animals to fuck?</v>

<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

<v Speaker 1>animals like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>How come white people can't talk to </v>

2367

<v Speaker 1>monkeys but black people can't get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck out of here with your racist </v>

<v Speaker 1>but his hair is just perfect.</v>

2379
01:45:48.890 --> 01:45:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Fits just like styles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little kind of frosted lightly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2388
01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:20.030
<v Speaker 1>So that was a while back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2389
01:46:20.210 --> 01:46:22.880
<v Speaker 1>yesterday I was out in my yard and I let</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've chickens and the chickens are </v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering around and there's three </v>

2391
01:46:27.881 --> 01:46:27.881
<v Speaker 1>fucking hawks.</v>

2392
01:46:27.881 --> 01:46:28.790
<v Speaker 1>They're not big hawks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're small.</v>

2393
01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:30.610
<v Speaker 1>They're like the size of this thermos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2394
01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:32.450
<v Speaker 1>so probably like 12 inches high or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2395
01:46:32.451 --> 01:46:37.451
<v Speaker 1>Not a big hawk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're trying to jack these </v>

2396
01:46:37.451 --> 01:46:41.111

01:46:41.111 --> 01:46:44.410
<v Speaker 1>and one of them swoops down and slams </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the Mesh like bangs into the mesh </v>

2398
01:46:44.421 --> 01:46:46.880
<v Speaker 1>of the chicken coop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just trying to get at them.</v>

2399
01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:50.490
<v Speaker 1>She's a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

2400
01:46:50.491 --> 01:46:55.491
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have my kids come out and my wife </v>

2401
01:46:55.491 --> 01:46:58.401
<v Speaker 1>come out and we're looking at these </v>
<v Speaker 1>birds swooping down and one of them </v>

2402
01:46:58.401 --> 01:46:59.340
<v Speaker 1>landing on top of the roof and the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>one's in the trees.</v>

2403
01:47:00.110 --> 01:47:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so fucking strange,</v>

2404
01:47:01.981 --> 01:47:02.760
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is going on?</v>

2405
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:06.720
<v Speaker 1>And they're just making noise like </v>
<v Speaker 1>really loud.</v>

2406
01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:11.370
<v Speaker 1>They're juveniles and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've found two of them that are dead and</v>

2407
01:47:11.371 --> 01:47:16.371
<v Speaker 1>what I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two of them that I found that are </v>

2408
01:47:16.371 --> 01:47:16.371
<v Speaker 1>dead are bigger.</v>

2409
01:47:16.371 --> 01:47:16.371
<v Speaker 1>So I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw these animals,</v>

2410
01:47:16.371 --> 01:47:18.480
<v Speaker 1>these small ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next day I found a dead one</v>

2411
01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:22.200
<v Speaker 1>in the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One a also had its head missing.</v>

2412
01:47:22.650 --> 01:47:27.650
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bird war going on in my neighborhood </v>

2413
01:47:27.650 --> 01:47:30.870
<v Speaker 1>that there's like a bird gang war going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on and I think there's hawks and there's</v>

2414
01:47:30.871 --> 01:47:33.200
<v Speaker 1>larger hawks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2415
01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:38.300
<v Speaker 1>one of my friends saw a larger hawk </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating baby hawks in a tree.</v>

2416
01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2417
01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:41.910
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2418
01:47:41.970 --> 01:47:46.530
<v Speaker 1>he was in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the way down the street and uh,</v>

2419
01:47:46.531 --> 01:47:51.030
<v Speaker 1>apparently go into his car and he saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>these hawks that are in our neighborhood</v>

2420
01:47:51.210 --> 01:47:54.750
<v Speaker 1>killing these baby hawks and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

2421
01:47:55.230 --> 01:47:56.040
<v Speaker 1>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2422
01:47:56.230 --> 01:47:58.620
<v Speaker 1>so there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the babies were there by themselves.</v>

2423
01:47:58.621 --> 01:48:01.050
<v Speaker 1>They were like in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the hawks killing the babies.</v>

2424
01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Like he saw it happen.</v>

2425
01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:03.900
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is insane.</v>

2426
01:48:03.901 --> 01:48:08.901
<v Speaker 1>So this is like some sort of a gang war </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they told them about the hawks </v>

2427
01:48:08.901 --> 01:48:08.901
<v Speaker 1>being dead and he found one of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2428
01:48:08.901 --> 01:48:10.770
<v Speaker 1>that shit is getting real in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

2429
01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Did it's crazy fucking hock Mageddon I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder.</v>

2430
01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just hawks killing other </v>
<v Speaker 1>hawks.</v>

2431
01:48:16.681 --> 01:48:21.681
<v Speaker 1>Like they're trying to like establish </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably just like all these other </v>

2432
01:48:21.681 --> 01:48:23.310
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently mountain lions do that.</v>

2433
01:48:23.311 --> 01:48:28.311
<v Speaker 1>Two bears do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll kill young ones to find other </v>

2434
01:48:28.311 --> 01:48:28.860
<v Speaker 1>people's young and kill them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think they're competition.</v>

2435
01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:30.960
<v Speaker 1>There's only so many rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2436
01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:34.530

2438
01:48:36.990 --> 01:48:39.620

01:50:45.371 --> 01:50:50.371
<v Speaker 2>that he would get picked as people to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in the laugh factory because it was </v>

01:50:50.371 --> 01:50:54.500
<v Speaker 2>an open mic and they would pick chicks </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than they would pick dudes because </v>

2492
01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:59.031
<v Speaker 2>there weren't very many chicks,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Once you go into why is he getting so </v>
<v Speaker 3>small?</v>

2627
01:57:02.170 --> 01:57:03.380
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Started caving in.</v>

2628
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:04.530
<v Speaker 3>Met Everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was Katie</v>

2629
01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:06.850
<v Speaker 4>aware?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good Lord.</v>

2630
01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:11.880
<v Speaker 4>Good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I have a friend so I went to </v>

2631
01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:14.670
<v Speaker 4>dinner with a friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's awesome and I hadn't seen her for </v>

2632
01:57:14.670 --> 01:57:18.490
<v Speaker 4>awhile and she got plastic surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>plastic surgery and I didn't,</v>

2633
01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:23.760
<v Speaker 4>she didn't bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hadn't seen her for like five years </v>

2634
01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:23.760
<v Speaker 4>and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2635
01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:27.650
<v Speaker 4>it was noticeable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Big Time but enough and I didn't </v>

2636
01:57:27.650 --> 01:57:31.051
<v Speaker 4>know how to handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know what to do so I just </v>

2637
01:57:31.051 --> 01:57:31.051
<v Speaker 4>didn't say anything but I wanted to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2638
01:57:31.051 --> 01:57:32.180
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2639
01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:33.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once somebody already does it,</v>

2640
01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:36.640
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a moot point to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2641
01:57:36.641 --> 01:57:38.260
<v Speaker 4>what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go back.</v>

2642
01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:43.880
<v Speaker 4>So I just let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was really awkward because it </v>

2643
01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:46.531
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was already fucking gorgeous and </v>

2644
01:57:46.531 --> 01:57:49.481
<v Speaker 4>then I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why she did that to </v>

2645
01:57:49.481 --> 01:57:49.481
<v Speaker 4>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was really,</v>

2646
01:57:49.481 --> 01:57:51.700
<v Speaker 4>it was really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very bizarre feeling you.</v>

2647
01:57:51.730 --> 01:57:53.950
<v Speaker 4>Have you experienced that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you had seen?</v>

2648
01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:55.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you must've.</v>

2649
01:57:55.470 --> 01:57:57.360
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my friend,</v>

2650
01:57:57.361 --> 01:58:02.361
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2653
01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:07.860
<v Speaker 3>And he hadn't seen her in a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he actually told me about this.</v>

2654
01:58:09.150 --> 01:58:11.400
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after we did the podcast,</v>

2655
01:58:11.401 --> 01:58:14.220
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about that eye surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember when we showed it,</v>

2656
01:58:14.221 --> 01:58:19.221
<v Speaker 3>like how many Korean women in particular</v>
<v Speaker 3>are getting this crazy surgery where it </v>

2657
01:58:19.221 --> 01:58:19.650
<v Speaker 3>changes your face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes your eyes way bigger.</v>

2658
01:58:19.651 --> 01:58:20.840
<v Speaker 3>They cut your lids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>super popular.</v>

2661
01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:30.960
<v Speaker 3>He hadn't seen her in awhile and then he</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw her and she had the thing done and </v>

2662
01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:32.730
<v Speaker 3>he didn't recognize her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

2663
01:58:32.731 --> 01:58:34.050
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it was off.</v>

2665
01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:41.480
<v Speaker 3>It was like if I saw you and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden your eyes were giant and had to </v>

2666
01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:41.480

<v Speaker 2>they've ruined movies.</v>

2834
02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:38.180
<v Speaker 2>This is why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like to tell a story in 90 </v>

2835
02:05:38.180 --> 02:05:40.221
<v Speaker 2>minutes or so limited,</v>

2839
02:05:45.771 --> 02:05:49.341
<v Speaker 2>Like you take an alien life form,</v>

<v Speaker 2>be like plot mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to take place.</v>

2847
02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:01.740
<v Speaker 2>Like the alien has to attack the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

<v Speaker 2>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking idiot.</v>

2856
02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:24.270
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy grandma.</v>

2857
02:06:24.710 --> 02:06:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Be hanging around with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what is that?</v>

2858
02:06:28.150 --> 02:06:29.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't my ground.</v>

2859
02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Nobody know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people I do hang out with people </v>

2860
02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:34.040
<v Speaker 2>that are critical like director friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit,</v>

2861
02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:38.571
<v Speaker 2>but oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>directors of the worst to watch a movie </v>

2862
02:06:38.571 --> 02:06:38.571
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2863
02:06:38.571 --> 02:06:38.571
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty bad director people </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're,</v>

2864
02:06:38.571 --> 02:06:41.220
<v Speaker 2>they're so beyond critical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I'm critical of comedy.</v>

2865
02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:46.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like when I go to comedies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walk out of a lot of them because I </v>

2866
02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:46.220
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2867
02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:49.570
<v Speaker 2>you know what the worst is if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're around actors that haven't made </v>

2868
02:06:49.570 --> 02:06:52.260
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actors that like barely work negative.</v>

02:08:38.121 --> 02:08:39.790
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they deliver it in pounds.</v>

2910
02:08:39.970 --> 02:08:44.970
<v Speaker 4>He just on adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't even know he's making a </v>

2911
02:08:44.970 --> 02:08:44.970
<v Speaker 4>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just found out it's a movie.</v>

2912
02:08:44.970 --> 02:08:47.260
<v Speaker 4>I thought he was in a dream about making</v>
<v Speaker 4>a movie.</v>

2913
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:49.090
<v Speaker 4>You just found out he's actually making </v>
<v Speaker 4>a movie.</v>

02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:51.430
<v Speaker 4>He has no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he thought it was at the fit,</v>

2915
02:08:51.431 --> 02:08:54.640
<v Speaker 4>so he hasn't slept in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just one year,</v>

2916
02:08:54.641 --> 02:08:59.641
<v Speaker 4>no sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy puts adderall on his foot and </v>

2917
02:08:59.641 --> 02:09:02.341
<v Speaker 4>then kicks it in the next mouth thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you didn't sleep for a long time but </v>

2918
02:09:02.341 --> 02:09:02.930
<v Speaker 4>you were still up moving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would probably just start.</v>

2919
02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:04.240
<v Speaker 4>Just start hallucinating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2920
02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:07.630
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that what people did right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was the story.</v>

2921
02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:12.190
<v Speaker 4>I did a show in Tahoe riders on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>storm riders.</v>

2922
02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:17.520
<v Speaker 4>I did a show in Tahoe and I forgot to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>hydrated so I didn't get hydrated at </v>

2923
02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:17.520
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

2924
02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:21.130
<v Speaker 4>And so I didn't drink any water and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was drinking on the plane that me and my</v>

2925
02:09:21.131 --> 02:09:26.131
<v Speaker 4>buddy got an arena and he drove a Tahoe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were drinking in Tahoe and I did my </v>

2926
02:09:26.131 --> 02:09:26.470
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just kept drinking.</v>

2927
02:09:26.471 --> 02:09:30.110
<v Speaker 4>I didn't drink any water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I got back.</v>

2928
02:09:30.970 --> 02:09:33.300
<v Speaker 4>I was up like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

2929
02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:35.700
<v Speaker 4>maybe like 15 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

2930
02:09:35.701 --> 02:09:40.701
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kept drinking and like didn't really </v>

2931
02:09:40.701 --> 02:09:40.701
<v Speaker 4>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm at the Casino,</v>

2932
02:09:40.701 --> 02:09:42.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I started feeling sick and then</v>

2933
02:09:42.071 --> 02:09:44.470
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried to go to bed and I can't.</v>

2934
02:09:45.010 --> 02:09:50.010
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm awake throughout the night and </v>

2935
02:09:50.010 --> 02:09:52.111
<v Speaker 4>then the next day I'm like still awake </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like kind of panicking now </v>

2936
02:09:52.111 --> 02:09:52.180
<v Speaker 4>because I haven't slept for like over 24</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

2937
02:09:52.510 --> 02:09:53.140
<v Speaker 4>And now I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2938
02:09:53.141 --> 02:09:58.141
<v Speaker 4>I've realized that I have altitude </v>
<v Speaker 4>sickness because I had my puking and </v>

2939
02:09:58.141 --> 02:09:58.141
<v Speaker 4>then I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm starting to drink water.</v>

2940
02:09:58.141 --> 02:10:03.090
<v Speaker 4>So I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I drank and I had alcohol poisoning and </v>

2941
02:10:03.090 --> 02:10:06.271
<v Speaker 4>altitude sickness and sleep deprivation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I flew home to La and I had slept for</v>

2942
02:10:07.271 --> 02:10:10.180
<v Speaker 4>like 30 fucking six hours and I'm in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>bed.</v>

2943
02:10:10.181 --> 02:10:15.181
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to go to sleep so I get in my bed </v>

2944
02:10:15.181 --> 02:10:15.181
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2945
02:10:15.181 --> 02:10:17.290
<v Speaker 4>I just start hearing like music and like</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this stuff and like people,</v>

2946
02:10:17.291 --> 02:10:19.900
<v Speaker 4>like there was a party next door but </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no party.</v>

2947
02:10:20.530 --> 02:10:21.970
<v Speaker 4>And then so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

2948
02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:25.360
<v Speaker 4>And then I'm lying in my bed and I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>hear pounding on my floor.</v>

2949
02:10:26.230 --> 02:10:27.430
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

2950
02:10:27.431 --> 02:10:29.200
<v Speaker 4>And I heard like legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like pounding.</v>

2951
02:10:29.770 --> 02:10:34.770
<v Speaker 4>And I was like totally awake and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>realized I hadn't slept and then I like </v>

2952
02:10:34.770 --> 02:10:36.260
<v Speaker 4>took like a sunlight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sleeping,</v>

2953
02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:39.260

<v Speaker 4>Do last.</v>

2986
02:11:58.260 --> 02:12:00.000
<v Speaker 4>And think how you would've handled </v>
<v Speaker 4>things differently.</v>

2987
02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:02.160
<v Speaker 4>I never saw last summer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I went up to sewed,</v>

02:12:03.340 --> 02:12:05.470
<v Speaker 1>never saw one episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that.</v>

2989

<v Speaker 1>I heard it kind of jumped ship last </v>

2992
02:12:15.790 --> 02:12:19.450
<v Speaker 1>season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like they're all standing around </v>

2993
02:12:19.450 --> 02:12:19.450
<v Speaker 1>while there's a pool that brings you </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to life.</v>

2994
02:12:19.450 --> 02:12:20.140
<v Speaker 1>And no one's freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

02:12:26.621 --> 02:12:31.621
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just standing around there and </v>

2999
02:12:31.621 --> 02:12:33.770
<v Speaker 1>like that perfect order that you do on </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitcoms was the person talking here and </v>

3000
02:12:33.770 --> 02:12:35.980
<v Speaker 1>there's another person talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that never happens in real life.</v>

3001
02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:37.670
<v Speaker 1>The perfect blocking.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's the most beautiful place on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's peaceful.</v>

3119
02:16:51.020 --> 02:16:56.020
<v Speaker 1>You're relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've given away all your personal </v>

3120
02:16:56.020 --> 02:16:56.020
<v Speaker 1>belongings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a pure minimalist.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and a microphone.</v>

3123
02:16:59.770 --> 02:17:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The microphone downstairs breaks because</v>

3124
02:17:01.481 --> 02:17:03.370
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you go down and talk to people.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I have a mic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

3130
02:17:13.891 --> 02:17:18.891
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of whenever I want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Immediately you telling me you wouldn't </v>

3131
02:17:18.891 --> 02:17:21.690
<v Speaker 4>go to a bar if you knew that every night</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joey Diaz was going to take a microphone</v>

3132
02:17:21.691 --> 02:17:23.490
<v Speaker 4>and just start walking through the crowd</v>
<v Speaker 4>and talking shit.</v>

3133
02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:25.950
<v Speaker 4>A hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would do that 100 percent.</v>

3134

3171
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:48.570
<v Speaker 4>The difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I quit eating dairy and it was some</v>

3172
02:18:48.571 --> 02:18:53.571
<v Speaker 4>random dude at a juice bar who worked </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and I was always sick and he was </v>

3173
02:18:53.571 --> 02:18:53.670
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

3175
02:18:55.141 --> 02:18:56.070
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was like,</v>

3176
02:18:56.520 --> 02:18:57.780
<v Speaker 4>do you eat a lot of dairy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

3178
02:18:58.351 --> 02:18:59.430
<v Speaker 4>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

3179
02:18:59.431 --> 02:19:01.690
<v Speaker 4>quit eating dairy for two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See how you feel.</v>

3180
02:19:01.710 --> 02:19:03.490
<v Speaker 4>He's like cold Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>

3181
02:19:03.491 --> 02:19:04.320
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>

3182
02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:06.870
<v Speaker 4>So I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I haven't been back in eight years.</v>

3183
02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:08.940
<v Speaker 4>My sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

3184
02:19:08.941 --> 02:19:12.870
<v Speaker 4>My stomach never got sick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never got migraines.</v>

3185
02:19:12.900 --> 02:19:16.260
<v Speaker 4>It changed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I got super fascinated by that.</v>

3186
02:19:16.261 --> 02:19:18.030
<v Speaker 4>I still drank by tits off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

3187
02:19:18.270 --> 02:19:21.480
<v Speaker 4>Have you tried raw milk?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3188
02:19:21.570 --> 02:19:26.570
<v Speaker 4>Apparently some people have an issue </v>
<v Speaker 4>with homogenized and pasteurized milk </v>

3189
02:19:26.570 --> 02:19:28.280
<v Speaker 4>and they don't have it with raw milk or </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have it with goats</v>

3190
02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:30.710
<v Speaker 3>milk too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially raw goat's milk.</v>

3191
02:19:30.711 --> 02:19:33.980
<v Speaker 3>I've heard about goats milk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to just bypass all of it.</v>

3192
02:19:33.981 --> 02:19:36.090
<v Speaker 3>I do like almond milk and rice milk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3193
02:19:36.140 --> 02:19:37.430
<v Speaker 3>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

3194
02:19:37.431 --> 02:19:42.431
<v Speaker 3>it's an ethical thing to bypass to if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you really stop and think about it </v>

3195
02:19:42.431 --> 02:19:44.330
<v Speaker 3>because there's something fucking creepy</v>
<v Speaker 3>about mass produced like handles yanking</v>

3196
02:19:44.331 --> 02:19:47.840
<v Speaker 3>on titties and these cows that are like </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of perpetually pregnant.</v>

3197
02:19:47.841 --> 02:19:49.970
<v Speaker 3>Like isn't that what they are?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the cows.</v>

3198
02:19:49.971 --> 02:19:52.280
<v Speaker 3>Like they're constantly nursing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3199
02:19:52.281 --> 02:19:52.850
<v Speaker 3>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3200
02:19:52.851 --> 02:19:56.900
<v Speaker 3>they make them get knocked up nor to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the milk come out.</v>

3201
02:19:56.901 --> 02:19:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The milk doesn't just come,</v>

3202
02:19:58.230 --> 02:20:00.050
<v Speaker 3>it's out in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their nursing.</v>

3203
02:20:00.140 --> 02:20:01.910
<v Speaker 3>It's a little weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3204
02:20:01.911 --> 02:20:03.470
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking weird.</v>

3205
02:20:03.650 --> 02:20:08.650
<v Speaker 3>But I want to try to fuck with going </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegan for a little bit and just see how </v>

3206
02:20:08.650 --> 02:20:08.870
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

3207
02:20:09.060 --> 02:20:10.760
<v Speaker 3>so far how long you been doing it?</v>

3208
02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:13.460
<v Speaker 3>Two days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

3209
02:20:13.461 --> 02:20:18.350
<v Speaker 3>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really eat a lot of red meat and</v>

3210
02:20:18.351 --> 02:20:20.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I eat like chicken and fish,</v>

3211
02:20:20.451 --> 02:20:25.451
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to try to go vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try to do it for like two </v>

3212
02:20:25.451 --> 02:20:25.451
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3213
02:20:25.451 --> 02:20:27.460
<v Speaker 3>one way that you can get protein that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very ethical and um,</v>

3214
02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:32.500
<v Speaker 3>you don't even have to think about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>too much is scallops and muscles and </v>

3215
02:20:32.751 --> 02:20:36.110
<v Speaker 3>things along those lines when you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the fuck.</v>

3216
02:20:36.111 --> 02:20:39.740
<v Speaker 3>Are they called mollusks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the word?</v>

3217
02:20:40.130 --> 02:20:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Shellfish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shellfish is what I'm looking for.</v>

3218
02:20:42.380 --> 02:20:47.380
<v Speaker 3>Shellfish in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like especially like clams and oysters,</v>

3219
02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:51.260
<v Speaker 3>oysters and things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so primitive.</v>

3220
02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:54.890
<v Speaker 3>They don't even have nervous systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just think of them as like an animal,</v>

3221
02:20:54.891 --> 02:20:57.800
<v Speaker 3>like a living creature because they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>move and close this.</v>

3222
02:20:58.010 --> 02:21:03.010
<v Speaker 3>But a venus fly trap is probably way </v>
<v Speaker 3>more sophisticated and it's a plant way </v>

3223
02:21:03.741 --> 02:21:06.080
<v Speaker 3>more sophisticated in organism than </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3224
02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:07.790
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're talking about those</v>

3225
02:21:07.791 --> 02:21:12.791
<v Speaker 3>acacia trees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll have this communications that </v>

3226
02:21:12.791 --> 02:21:12.791
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing going on like that with </v>
<v Speaker 3>mollusks.</v>

3227
02:21:12.830 --> 02:21:17.830
<v Speaker 3>They're like really stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was super ancient life forms that </v>

3228
02:21:17.830 --> 02:21:21.941
<v Speaker 3>are kind of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're almost like what we're </v>

3229
02:21:21.941 --> 02:21:24.461
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that fucking gelatinous thing </v>

3230
02:21:24.461 --> 02:21:24.461
<v Speaker 3>inside of the box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're like.</v>

3231
02:21:24.461 --> 02:21:25.430
<v Speaker 3>You could eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3232
02:21:25.431 --> 02:21:26.990
<v Speaker 3>Scallops are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3233
02:21:26.991 --> 02:21:29.840
<v Speaker 3>I've had scallops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're amazing because they will.</v>

3234
02:21:29.930 --> 02:21:30.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3235
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:34.760
<v Speaker 3>scalp is a mosque like clams and mussels</v>
<v Speaker 3>and mosque.</v>

3236
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:36.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a genre expert.</v>

3237
02:21:36.741 --> 02:21:38.300
<v Speaker 3>Five minutes ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you remember the name of it?</v>

3238
02:21:39.430 --> 02:21:41.540
<v Speaker 3>I just forgot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but scallops are amazing,</v>

3239
02:21:41.541 --> 02:21:44.810
<v Speaker 3>but those things are like a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oysters,</v>

3240
02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:47.750
<v Speaker 3>they're a good way to get protein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them is sustainable.</v>

3241
02:21:47.751 --> 02:21:52.751
<v Speaker 3>A lot of those things are sustainable </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they actually make like farms </v>

3242
02:21:52.751 --> 02:21:56.141
<v Speaker 3>have them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They grow them on the ground the same </v>

3243
02:21:56.141 --> 02:21:56.141
<v Speaker 3>way you would grow fruit.</v>

3244
02:21:56.141 --> 02:21:56.141
<v Speaker 3>They grow them on the ground of an ocean</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

3245
02:21:56.180 --> 02:21:59.570
<v Speaker 3>but the same way you would grow fruit or</v>
<v Speaker 3>grow vegetables,</v>

3246
02:21:59.571 --> 02:22:04.571
<v Speaker 3>like you can grow these things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a good source of quote unquote </v>

3247
02:22:04.571 --> 02:22:07.640
<v Speaker 3>animal protein in an ethical way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like these things are so primitive.</v>

3248
02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:08.900
<v Speaker 3>They have like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3249
02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:11.390
<v Speaker 3>they're not feeling shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're not getting bummed out that</v>

3250
02:22:11.391 --> 02:22:13.690
<v Speaker 3>you're eating right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just clamped down and closed.</v>

3251
02:22:13.691 --> 02:22:15.880
<v Speaker 3>They were like super duper high in </v>
<v Speaker 3>protein.</v>

3252
02:22:16.110 --> 02:22:17.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very high in protein.</v>

3253
02:22:17.180 --> 02:22:19.850
<v Speaker 3>Really good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm oysters are a good way to,</v>

3254
02:22:19.851 --> 02:22:24.851
<v Speaker 3>especially oysters in olive oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good way to stay in a fat based </v>

3255
02:22:24.851 --> 02:22:26.220
<v Speaker 3>diet like Ketogenic Diet because there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much fat</v>

3256
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:29.040
<v Speaker 1>in them for the olive oil and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>oysters themselves.</v>

3257
02:22:29.041 --> 02:22:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very healthy for you.</v>

3258
02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really good for your body.</v>

3259
02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I got sick from noise because I had too </v>
<v Speaker 1>many at one time,</v>

3260
02:22:34.951 --> 02:22:37.200
<v Speaker 1>but there's a different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different story.</v>

3261
02:22:37.201 --> 02:22:38.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raw oysters.</v>

3262
02:22:38.641 --> 02:22:40.560
<v Speaker 1>You really got to get fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

3263
02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Talking about cooked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoked oysters.</v>

3264
02:22:42.191 --> 02:22:45.480
<v Speaker 1>You getting like cans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I take them with me on the road.</v>

3265
02:22:45.780 --> 02:22:48.720
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a buy them in bulk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take them with me on the road.</v>

3266
02:22:48.721 --> 02:22:50.760
<v Speaker 1>So I have healthy snacks like in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel rooms.</v>

3267
02:22:50.761 --> 02:22:54.300
<v Speaker 1>And Oysters isn't bad for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3268
02:22:55.230 --> 02:23:00.230
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure like there's some leaching of </v>

3269
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:03.060
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you put something into a container.</v>

3270
02:23:03.061 --> 02:23:08.061
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say she eat it every day </v>

3271
02:23:08.061 --> 02:23:08.061
<v Speaker 1>because I used to eat sardines every </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

3272
02:23:08.061 --> 02:23:10.200
<v Speaker 1>but I turned positive for arsenic.</v>

3273
02:23:10.530 --> 02:23:14.430
<v Speaker 1>They found traces of arsenic in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and they were like deadly.</v>

3274
02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:19.790
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently it's just one of the </v>

3275
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:21.360
<v Speaker 1>heavy metals that is a at the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ocean that's affected by pollution.</v>

3276
02:23:21.660 --> 02:23:26.660
<v Speaker 1>The levels of it are affected by </v>
<v Speaker 1>pollution and so these sardines are </v>

3277
02:23:26.660 --> 02:23:29.140
<v Speaker 1>particularly the kind of bottom feeders </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're in a polluted area and you</v>

3278
02:23:29.141 --> 02:23:32.280
<v Speaker 1>get sardines from polluted area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll have heavy metals in them,</v>

3279
02:23:32.610 --> 02:23:35.780
<v Speaker 1>you know like mercury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mercury here that.</v>

3280
02:23:37.230 --> 02:23:39.930
<v Speaker 1>So I got off the sardines for awhile and</v>
<v Speaker 1>went back and got tested.</v>

3281
02:23:39.931 --> 02:23:41.220
<v Speaker 1>It was a hundred percent clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

3282
02:23:41.230 --> 02:23:42.390
<v Speaker 1>it's gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the sardines.</v>

3283
02:23:42.391 --> 02:23:43.410
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally makes sense.</v>

3284
02:23:44.060 --> 02:23:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Can't eat them every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

3285
02:23:45.210 --> 02:23:46.590
<v Speaker 1>I was eating like three or four cans a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

3286
02:23:46.980 --> 02:23:51.980
<v Speaker 1>like three or four kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything is high in sodium.</v>

3287
02:23:53.971 --> 02:23:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Two sodiums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3288
02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Just drink as long as you drink water.</v>

3289
02:23:57.070 --> 02:23:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Sodium was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea that there's a,</v>

3290
02:23:59.350 --> 02:24:04.350
<v Speaker 1>a total misconception about sodium </v>
<v Speaker 1>causing high blood pressure and heart </v>

3291
02:24:04.350 --> 02:24:09.261
<v Speaker 1>attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was all based on a bullshit study </v>

3292
02:24:09.261 --> 02:24:09.261
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody pushed through what?</v>

3293
02:24:09.261 --> 02:24:14.210
<v Speaker 1>What was that study like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sodium does not cause high blood </v>

3294
02:24:14.210 --> 02:24:17.781
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go Google that because there was this </v>

3295
02:24:17.781 --> 02:24:20.151
<v Speaker 1>whole bogus study that people keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeating over and over again about </v>

3296
02:24:20.151 --> 02:24:24.471
<v Speaker 1>salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you have too much of anything </v>

3297
02:24:24.471 --> 02:24:24.471
<v Speaker 1>to kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3298
02:24:24.471 --> 02:24:24.471
<v Speaker 1>Like we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

3299
02:24:24.471 --> 02:24:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Water will fuck you up too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salt will definitely kill you.</v>

3300
02:24:26.130 --> 02:24:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Too many star trek a pound of salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking dead,</v>

3301
02:24:28.651 --> 02:24:30.000
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a dead man.</v>

3302
02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:33.150
<v Speaker 1>You can eat a pound of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's time to end the war on salt.</v>

3303
02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Zealous drive by politicians to limit </v>
<v Speaker 1>our salt intake has little basis in </v>

3304
02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:38.200
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3305
02:24:38.220 --> 02:24:39.750
<v Speaker 1>it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

3306
02:24:40.290 --> 02:24:42.480
<v Speaker 1>it's an essential mineral like you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>salt,</v>

3307
02:24:42.750 --> 02:24:43.110
<v Speaker 1>salt.</v>

3308
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Is it really important that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to have too much of it?</v>

3309
02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That meaning like you don't want to </v>

3310
02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:53.061
<v Speaker 1>cover everything in Salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like you don't want to drink too </v>

3311

<v Speaker 2>movie and I came home and I went to bed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and said hi to him.</v>

3425
02:29:55.910 --> 02:30:00.660
<v Speaker 2>And then the next day he like flipped </v>
<v Speaker 2>out on me and I texted him.</v>

3426
02:30:00.661 --> 02:30:01.280
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up man?</v>

3427
02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:03.310
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my ex girlfriend was at air,</v>

3428
02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:04.340
<v Speaker 2>fucking house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3429
02:30:04.341 --> 02:30:06.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was watch a movie with my buddy.</v>

3430
02:30:06.201 --> 02:30:07.610
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck man?</v>

3431
02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:11.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like he didn't tell me fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I never talked to me again.</v>

3432
02:30:11.810 --> 02:30:16.400
<v Speaker 2>So you were supposed to tell him that </v>
<v Speaker 2>his ex girlfriend is dating your buddy?</v>

3433
02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3434
02:30:17.430 --> 02:30:20.470
<v Speaker 2>well it was so bizarre and he's one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my best friends and he won't talk to me.</v>

3435
02:30:20.740 --> 02:30:22.580
<v Speaker 2>That you wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't tell him about it.</v>

3436
02:30:22.610 --> 02:30:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's been a year and he won't talk </v>

3437
02:30:27.610 --> 02:30:27.610
<v Speaker 2>to me anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

3438
02:30:27.610 --> 02:30:29.900
<v Speaker 2>Now does he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he want you to stop it in some way?</v>

3439
02:30:29.930 --> 02:30:31.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never found out.</v>

3440
02:30:31.520 --> 02:30:35.260
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I could understand like if you want,</v>

3441
02:30:35.660 --> 02:30:38.000
<v Speaker 2>if you told him he would just get bummed</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

3442
02:30:38.060 --> 02:30:39.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the thing.</v>

3443
02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:41.050
<v Speaker 2>They were just watching a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like a,</v>

3444
02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:43.010
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't dating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just really weird.</v>

3445
02:30:43.011 --> 02:30:48.011
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my point being is that while you around </v>

3446
02:30:48.011 --> 02:30:48.110
<v Speaker 2>soon as you got out of the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a love song,</v>

3447
02:30:50.500 --> 02:30:54.800
<v Speaker 2>but it's like it's like bad road friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just gets fucking needs this,</v>

3448
02:30:54.920 --> 02:30:55.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3449
02:30:55.500 --> 02:30:57.560
<v Speaker 2>I just can't deal with drama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I go out,</v>

3450
02:30:57.561 --> 02:31:02.561
<v Speaker 2>I don't want drama and nobody does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what we're talking about </v>

3451
02:31:02.561 --> 02:31:05.120
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how chimps have this horrific behavior.</v>

3452
02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:07.400
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some of that leftover </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people,</v>

3453
02:31:07.401 --> 02:31:11.720
<v Speaker 2>and I think it comes out when you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in relationships and breakups.</v>

3454
02:31:12.110 --> 02:31:15.080
<v Speaker 2>I think you see that angry chimp come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out sometimes.</v>

3455
02:31:15.650 --> 02:31:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol is one of those things.</v>

3456
02:31:17.871 --> 02:31:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it affects not just even</v>

3457
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:21.870
<v Speaker 4>alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so jealousy too though.</v>

3458
02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:23.510
<v Speaker 4>Just jealousy as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3459
02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:26.090
<v Speaker 4>but also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but jealousy fueled with alcohol,</v>

3460
02:31:26.100 --> 02:31:31.100
<v Speaker 4>which is a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you look at the people that are </v>

3461
02:31:31.100 --> 02:31:34.071
<v Speaker 4>in jail right now because they got drunk</v>
<v Speaker 4>and got jealous and pulled out a gun or </v>

3462
02:31:34.071 --> 02:31:35.280
<v Speaker 4>pulled out a baseball bat and just went</v>

3463
02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:37.710
<v Speaker 3>and then add coke to that and you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>confident,</v>

3464
02:31:39.550 --> 02:31:41.280
<v Speaker 3>confident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazed,</v>

3465
02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:46.820
<v Speaker 3>righteous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll show her like you live in in some </v>

3466
02:31:46.820 --> 02:31:49.401
<v Speaker 3>stupid two dimensional movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you don't even thinking about the </v>

3467
02:31:49.401 --> 02:31:49.401
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

3468
02:31:49.401 --> 02:31:50.340
<v Speaker 4>Can't even cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't even.</v>

3469
02:31:50.740 --> 02:31:52.560
<v Speaker 4>I can't even do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never got really into it.</v>

3470
02:31:52.561 --> 02:31:53.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely did it,</v>

3471
02:31:53.431 --> 02:31:56.370
<v Speaker 4>but I was never one of those guys that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was just.</v>

3472
02:31:56.371 --> 02:32:01.371
<v Speaker 4>I mean I have friends still that go hard</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the paint with that and they're like </v>

3473
02:32:01.371 --> 02:32:04.380
<v Speaker 4>creeping into their forties and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>still every weekend.</v>

3474
02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:07.590
<v Speaker 3>Dunkin has a great bit on adderall that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had adderall and cocaine that I</v>

3475
02:32:07.591 --> 02:32:10.650
<v Speaker 3>wish I could share with the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll have to go see him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he moved.</v>

3478
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:17.160
<v Speaker 3>He's happy there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really upset because he liked it.</v>

3479
02:32:17.161 --> 02:32:18.900
<v Speaker 3>I was hoping he hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's living in Brooklyn.</v>

3480
02:32:18.901 --> 02:32:22.050
<v Speaker 3>He's like the king of Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see him like in Brooklyn.</v>

3481
02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:23.640
<v Speaker 3>They took him in and they gave him fresh</v>
<v Speaker 3>hats.</v>

3482
02:32:23.890 --> 02:32:25.060
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey guys.</v>

<v Speaker 3>folks with Aubrey.</v>

02:32:36.460 --> 02:32:38.830
<v Speaker 3>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a fucking cult.</v>

3488
02:32:38.980 --> 02:32:41.160
<v Speaker 3>Duncan's essentially running a colt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>

3489
02:32:41.530 --> 02:32:43.930
<v Speaker 3>He would be the best caught later.</v>

<v Speaker 3>live audience and it was so good.</v>

3496

<v Speaker 6>Will you be the household?</v>

3497

<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

02:33:05.211 --> 02:33:07.190
<v Speaker 3>That guy's a house home guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time.</v>

3499
02:33:07.191 --> 02:33:09.040
<v Speaker 3>Dunkin doesn't show that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys going to do owns for them.</v>

3500
02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:13.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a chance that he does.</v>

3501
02:33:13.821 --> 02:33:14.180
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

3502
02:33:14.330 --> 02:33:17.480
<v Speaker 3>we've done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in audiences.</v>

3503
02:33:17.481 --> 02:33:19.790
<v Speaker 3>We started off a show with it once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work.</v>

3504
02:33:19.791 --> 02:33:21.440
<v Speaker 3>It was a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a terrible idea.</v>

3505
02:33:21.750 --> 02:33:26.750
<v Speaker 3>We started off a show where we all got </v>
<v Speaker 3>on stage and had the audience ohm and </v>

3506
02:33:26.750 --> 02:33:26.930
<v Speaker 3>then Duncan went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did stand up,</v>

3507
02:33:26.931 --> 02:33:29.030
<v Speaker 3>but there were so weirded out by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time they were like,</v>

3508
02:33:29.031 --> 02:33:32.780
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you guys doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we did it a couple of times,</v>

3509
02:33:32.810 --> 02:33:34.790
<v Speaker 3>we did a couple of times to like breath </v>
<v Speaker 3>blessed the show.</v>

3510
02:33:36.420 --> 02:33:41.420
<v Speaker 4>I remember when I had my twitch channel </v>
<v Speaker 4>to Duncan does a twitch stream every so </v>

3511
02:33:41.420 --> 02:33:45.831
<v Speaker 4>often and what is he doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is a Watt James Corden dancing in </v>

3512
02:33:45.831 --> 02:33:50.391
<v Speaker 4>some way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he had a mask on and was holding a </v>

3513
02:33:50.391 --> 02:33:50.550
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course it's pretty fun to watch.</v>

3514
02:33:50.610 --> 02:33:51.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's out of his mind.</v>

3515
02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:54.420
<v Speaker 4>Don't get and wrote on my vagina mask is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that a vagina?</v>

3516
02:33:54.510 --> 02:33:56.210
<v Speaker 4>Looks like a vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vagina,</v>

3517
02:33:56.470 --> 02:33:57.240
<v Speaker 4>vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mask.</v>

3518
02:33:57.300 --> 02:33:59.310
<v Speaker 4>I had my show on comedy central,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretend time,</v>

3519
02:33:59.311 --> 02:34:01.560
<v Speaker 4>a sketch show and it was like really </v>
<v Speaker 4>aggressive and weird.</v>

3520
02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:02.760
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Duncan,</v>

3521
02:34:02.761 --> 02:34:05.180
<v Speaker 4>you got to write on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I brought Dunkin onto right.</v>

3522
02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:08.280
<v Speaker 4>And every sketch he would hand in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was always like,</v>

3523
02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:10.020
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is this going to be?</v>

3524
02:34:10.230 --> 02:34:13.520
<v Speaker 4>And it was so insane.</v>

3525
02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:19.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you're playing like a pussy and </v>

3529
02:34:24.900 --> 02:34:29.900
<v Speaker 4>a psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have to like just every sketch </v>

3530
02:34:29.901 --> 02:34:34.901
<v Speaker 4>or try to find what is arable out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean there were like obviously </v>

3531
02:34:35.661 --> 02:34:37.970
<v Speaker 4>moments of brilliance,</v>
