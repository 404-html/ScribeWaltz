00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.310
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience that became an</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue in Abu Dhabi with a lot of</v>

2
00:00:04.311 --> 00:00:05.144
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrests.</v>

3
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.200
<v Speaker 1>I should take guys down and just hold</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in positions and not go for</v>

4
00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:12.140
<v Speaker 1>submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just try to go for points and you know,</v>

5
00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:14.240
<v Speaker 1>and people will get furious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>

6
00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:17.360
<v Speaker 1>well this isn't Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people felt like the only way</v>

7
00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:20.840
<v Speaker 1>to compete with these guys is to do what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing is to fight smart.</v>

8
00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:24.200
<v Speaker 1>The only way you can win is to to fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>on points.</v>

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Would you rather lose on points then</v>
<v Speaker 1>when by holding a guy down?</v>

10
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have lost like,</v>

11
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.500
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't bother you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that mean you don't.</v>

12
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.550
<v Speaker 2>You show me a good loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you a loser,</v>

13
00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 2>muddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

14
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:46.791
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rather lose on points with keeping my</v>

15
00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:51.851
<v Speaker 2>mentality always with the objective to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get into a better place then to stop my</v>

16
00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:56.870
<v Speaker 2>game and try to find out how I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to win this match while using the time</v>

17
00:00:56.871 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 2>on my side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have five matches where I lost when</v>

18
00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 2>I could've went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was winning on points and then I went</v>

19
00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 2>for something or I try to advance the</v>
<v Speaker 2>position and I lost it and then doing it</v>

20
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 2>and then whatever the guy sweating me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I lost because the time ran</v>

21
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have lost matches like that and it</v>

22
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.610
<v Speaker 2>served as a good learning experience and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and you know,</v>

23
00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:19.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rather lose on points then to sit</v>

24
00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:21.860
<v Speaker 2>there and stopped again and wait for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time to,</v>

25
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to run out because I w I don't know if I</v>

26
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.990
<v Speaker 2>would feel like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

27
00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:31.991
<v Speaker 2>I feel like deep inside me I have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that I feel really bad if I don't</v>

28
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.040
<v Speaker 2>try to go for the next position.</v>

29
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.770
<v Speaker 2>I feel guilty almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're checking my grandfather's like</v>

<v Speaker 1>What if one day we went on that thing</v>

83
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 1>and it was a day where there was no</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies.</v>

84
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I did a podcast today with a guy from</v>

85
00:03:58.461 --> 00:04:00.830
<v Speaker 3>cracked.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan O'brian are at a really funny book</v>

86
00:04:00.831 --> 00:04:05.831
<v Speaker 3>called how to fight presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He literally took every president in the</v>

87
00:04:07.491 --> 00:04:10.340
<v Speaker 3>history of America to see who was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>baddest ass,</v>

88
00:04:10.341 --> 00:04:13.370
<v Speaker 3>who's the one guy you wouldn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight and who would win in a fight if</v>

89
00:04:13.371 --> 00:04:14.660
<v Speaker 3>they were pitted against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

90
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.060
<v Speaker 3>it's in some ways the greatest book of</v>
<v Speaker 3>all time.</v>

91
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.800
<v Speaker 3>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

92
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.300
<v Speaker 3>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be the greatest</v>

93
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.490
<v Speaker 3>podcasts of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the funniest thing because we got</v>

94
00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:27.491
<v Speaker 3>into a heavy heated argument about who</v>
<v Speaker 3>would win in a fight and you got to put</v>

95
00:04:27.861 --> 00:04:29.660
<v Speaker 3>a couple of presidents up at the top of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the list.</v>

96
00:04:29.661 --> 00:04:32.720
<v Speaker 3>You got to put a blanket because he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>renowned for his physical strength.</v>

97
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.940
<v Speaker 3>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fought vampires to right?</v>

98
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.133
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did,</v>

99
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.550
<v Speaker 3>but he used in the movie he used an ax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Abe Lincoln was 64 and had.</v>

100
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.680
<v Speaker 3>What's that disease where your arms are</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer,</v>

101
00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:45.560
<v Speaker 3>you have really long arms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like longer than your body had crazy one</v>

102
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 3>and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was known to be really strong and</v>

103
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.000
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very tough.</v>

104
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.903
<v Speaker 3>Acuity</v>

105
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.710
<v Speaker 1>was stable on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you also have to think of people</v>

106
00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:58.460
<v Speaker 1>that lived during that era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were a lot tougher period.</v>

107
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 1>They grew up doing everything with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>

108
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Building things.</v>

109
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what we were talking about.</v>

110
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Were you talking about this?</v>

111
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.250
<v Speaker 3>So then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

112
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:08.190
<v Speaker 3>what about Barack Obama?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he got quiet it.</v>

113
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.870
<v Speaker 3>Dan's a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good guy.</v>

114
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.400
<v Speaker 3>He got quiet and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

115
00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:12.280
<v Speaker 3>I can't really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

116
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:13.650
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather leave that alone.</v>

117
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:14.431
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

118
00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:15.330
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

119
00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:17.430
<v Speaker 3>I try not to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You try not to include any living</v>

120
00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:19.530
<v Speaker 3>presidents because it caused too much</v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>

121
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.000
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>

122
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.631
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

123
00:05:21.631 --> 00:05:25.830
<v Speaker 3>I went through sort of a thing about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>Barack Obama's not that tough a</v>

124
00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:29.370
<v Speaker 3>president and it'd be easy to kick his</v>
<v Speaker 3>ass and uh,</v>

125
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing it tongue in cheek,</v>

126
00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:32.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd probably kick him here and he's</v>

127
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:37.170
<v Speaker 3>kind of skinny and you could do and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets a call from the secret service</v>

128
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.940
<v Speaker 3>because he posted it as a blog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He posted as a blog from cracked.com.</v>

129
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said the reason,</v>

130
00:05:43.621 --> 00:05:47.880
<v Speaker 3>the only blog that's not up there</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore is that because he got called</v>

131
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:50.040
<v Speaker 3>down to the federal building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>

132
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.560
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on my podcast.</v>

133
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.940
<v Speaker 3>And he had to go line by line with these</v>
<v Speaker 3>agents on what he,</v>

134
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 3>by what he was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

135
00:05:58.851 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

136
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

137
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Dick Tornado instead of a penis cycling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's kind of funnier.</v>

138
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.450
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to teach them a humor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys were totally fucked her list.</v>

139
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.620
<v Speaker 3>He got all nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like apologizing.</v>

140
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 3>He made them a to take it down and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a chapter that was isolated from the</v>

141
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

142
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 3>so that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we live in America,</v>

143
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 3>how now you have to be careful when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've threatened to president,</v>

144
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 3>you will get called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But guys,</v>

145
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

146
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.970

<v Speaker 3>and he took his job,</v>

148
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 3>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they probably can't.</v>

149
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tell me no way to go.</v>

150
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

151
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Speaker 3>they probably knew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course he's joking,</v>

152
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 3>but there's a thing that you set in</v>
<v Speaker 3>motion a certain status.</v>

153
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:40.700
<v Speaker 3>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they said we will subpoena</v>

154
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.360
<v Speaker 3>everybody that made a comment on your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the blog,</v>

155
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.960
<v Speaker 3>kick his ass and,</v>

161
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 3>You've got to go down and talk to these</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
