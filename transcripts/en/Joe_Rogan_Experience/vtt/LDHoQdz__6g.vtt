<v Speaker 1>I would drive away from the White House in my last day in an El Camino.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

25
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.520
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

85
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people out there that would look at the Woodside wagon here and</v>

86
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:17.341

00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 1>That's a great vehicle.</v>

90
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.741
<v Speaker 1>There's a Camino.</v>

91
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:20.574
<v Speaker 1>To be fair.</v>

92
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>A lot more throwing up in their mouth.</v>

93
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>thank you for that fucking keyboards.</v>

97
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>This is essentially,</v>

98
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:31.620
<v Speaker 1>so it's sort of a preview of the,</v>

99
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.030
<v Speaker 1>this weekend's fights are really just a chance to get together and fuck around.</v>

100
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I was told it was a breakdown,</v>

101
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.533
<v Speaker 1>but he couldn't be.</v>

102
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.900
<v Speaker 1>I was told to break down hair.</v>

103
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.190
<v Speaker 1>I've studied all night for a break.</v>

104
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.891
<v Speaker 1>I have my notes.</v>

105
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I was told this is a breakdown.</v>

106
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.771
<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts,</v>

107
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>sir?</v>

108
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.113
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you asked.</v>

109
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go with a asked me,</v>

110
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>asked me.</v>

111
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.051
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

112
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go with Nate Diaz now.</v>

113
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Ask me why.</v>

114
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.583
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

115
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

116
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.611
<v Speaker 1>the way I look at it,</v>

117
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:57.660
<v Speaker 1>and correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

118
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Connors boxed the daylights at everybody.</v>

119
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Who for the most part either has his reach or smallest way does he hangs on the</v>

120
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:06.244
<v Speaker 1>edge of the pocket.</v>

121
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>He hangs on the edge of the pocket and he's a counterpuncher waits to you commit</v>

122
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>slips and hits.</v>

123
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>He's dealing with something very different with Nate,</v>

124
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>which is that Nate is longer and taller and neat,</v>

125
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to do that.</v>

126
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder what he's going to have to do is either one of two things is going</v>

127
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.660
<v Speaker 1>to have to weave and get inside or because nightstands so you know,</v>

128
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.743
<v Speaker 1>flat,</v>

129
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's sort of squares up with you.</v>

130
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>I guess he could back kick in front kick is his body,</v>

131
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>but kind doesn't kick.</v>

132
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not what you think.</v>

133
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:34.451
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

134
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Watch out for Connor.</v>

135
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Connor's a hard kicks.</v>

136
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:37.474
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

137
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>So he actually keeps pretty good.</v>

138
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

139
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.391
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>

140
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Very good kid.</v>

141
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't,</v>

142
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen much of him cause he's smoking.</v>

143
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is murky.</v>

144
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>But Nate's a very durable guy too.</v>

145
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 1>He spends a lot of time in those gyms with a lot of those Mexican boxers that</v>

146
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>stand in the hole and just bang,</v>

147
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>which is in Connor.</v>

148

257
00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:26.170
