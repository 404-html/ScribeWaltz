<v Speaker 1>already?</v>

2
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.220
<v Speaker 1>You already had started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>

3
00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:23.480
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just went live.</v>

4
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck what's going on?</v>

5

<v Speaker 1>We understand folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We hear your story.</v>

6
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.250
<v Speaker 1>You hear your plight that a ustream has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been fucking up for you.</v>

7
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been,</v>

8
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was called?</v>

9
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Buffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just lost my mic.</v>

10
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.490
<v Speaker 1>You know what I've noticed though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

11
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>is that browsers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if,</v>

12
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:48.851
<v Speaker 1>if it's fucking with you on one browser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried different one because the flash </v>

13
00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:49.400
<v Speaker 1>plugin alone has been just a connie </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

14
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.270
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on Youtube,</v>

16
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have problems on certain browsers </v>

17
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.070
<v Speaker 1>where it does certain things and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed it around and I've been noticing</v>

18
00:00:58.071 --> 00:01:01.610
<v Speaker 1>is a lot of browser issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use chrome for the most part.</v>

19
00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:03.020
<v Speaker 1>What do you use?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use safari.</v>

20
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>I went back to so far.</v>

21
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Why did you go back too far?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it seems like it's usually the </v>

22
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.430
<v Speaker 1>best when it comes to working with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

23
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been fucking with everything.</v>

24
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>It didn't use to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't use to be the best one.</v>

25
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

26
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's always been solid for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crumbs.</v>

27
00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:23.441
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with chrome is that I </v>

28
00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:25.990
<v Speaker 1>just go crazy with extensions and next </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing I know if he fucks things up like </v>

29
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.861
<v Speaker 1>ad block plus or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit fucks things up and then you </v>

30
00:01:29.861 --> 00:01:33.401
<v Speaker 1>forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be the reason why you know </v>

<v Speaker 1>you almost so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every type of motherfucker.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's a very high quality shirt as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to.</v>

119
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not that the other ones were low </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality but they're like the standard </v>

120
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.790
<v Speaker 1>way you get a t shirt when you have like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big design.</v>

121
00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Like that desk squad logo is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

122
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 1>they take like a vinyl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

123
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 1>it's fine or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some sort of static.</v>

124
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like a thick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the process is just a bunch of.</v>

125
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like it feels to have a plastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>shield on.</v>

126
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.480
<v Speaker 2>So like when you're working out you feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

127
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.510
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you almost have armor on and it's </v>

128
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 2>very uncomfortable when you have a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of colors when you get sweaty.</v>

129
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

130
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 2>If you get sweaty it gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

131
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 2>this process actually bleaches the shirt</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then read the ink in it.</v>

132
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:09.970
<v Speaker 2>So it's actually the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

133
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.860
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

134
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 2>just the cotton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can't even feel the design.</v>

135
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 2>So it's an upgrade from the last couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>of shirts I did.</v>

136
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted to have a little bit better </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality.</v>

137
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why they so sweet.</v>

140

<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck out of Cuban coffee.</v>

324
00:14:50.721 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 3>Fucks up that</v>

325
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not Persian coffee.</v>

326
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.310
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Greek coffee.</v>

327
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:58.150
<v Speaker 4>There's some coffee that's fucking out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there that the cola,</v>

328
00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.700
<v Speaker 4>the caffeine is just outrageous Greek or</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of those countries.</v>

329
00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.450
<v Speaker 4>Those coffees that people think are like</v>
<v Speaker 4>really strong.</v>

330
00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:09.140
<v Speaker 4>It's like the taste of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not necessarily the caffeine like,</v>

331
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess out everybody assumes Espresso's</v>

332
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.510
<v Speaker 4>like stronger than a cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>

333
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:15.830
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually weaker.</v>

334
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:20.831
<v Speaker 4>It as less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The lighter coffees are the ones with </v>

335
00:15:20.831 --> 00:15:20.960
<v Speaker 4>the more caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a dark,</v>

336
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 4>dark coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently a dark coffee doesn't have as</v>

337
00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:28.580
<v Speaker 4>much caffeine as like a lighter coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oftentimes like when you burn them more,</v>

338
00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:31.100
<v Speaker 4>I guess to make it dark maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>

339
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.340
<v Speaker 4>We roasted it longer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What am I talking about?</v>

340
00:15:34.341 --> 00:15:39.341

<v Speaker 4>but the first time I ever had Cuban </v>

341
00:15:39.341 --> 00:15:39.341
<v Speaker 4>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

342
00:15:39.341 --> 00:15:39.341

343
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.420
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You take coffee,</v>

344
00:15:41.421 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 4>you put a half a pound of sugar in it </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the start.</v>

345
00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:49.290
<v Speaker 4>They make sweets.</v>

488
00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:56.850
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Here's the other thing.</v>

492
00:22:00.161 --> 00:22:05.161
<v Speaker 2>It'd be better if it was actually sugar </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there and that was their sugar in </v>

493
00:22:05.161 --> 00:22:05.161
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but show zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Red Kool aid.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think that's just a reflection.</v>

499
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:22:21.311 --> 00:22:21.790
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You mean that little packet of Koolaid.</v>

503
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:30.420
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the same amount as a little </v>

504
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:30.420
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chocolate milk.</v>

505
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:30.420
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

506
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.200
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of sugar in our lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>

507
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.440
<v Speaker 2>We're kind of hooked on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

508
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:39.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying not to drink coffee right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've been drinking this Trenta sized</v>

509
00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.940
<v Speaker 2>passion fruit ice tea everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has no caffeine in it,</v>

510
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.690
<v Speaker 2>but I don't get the sweetener in it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I get splenda and that's just.</v>

511
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's got to give you brain cancer,</v>

512
00:22:48.771 --> 00:22:52.480
<v Speaker 2>but the night much splenda that drinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>that much Stevia go with the Stevia,</v>

513
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:56.500
<v Speaker 2>but starbucks doesn't have Stevia for </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone home.</v>

514

<v Speaker 2>Steve,</v>

516
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:01.990
<v Speaker 2>too expensive.</v>

517
00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:07.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they have a deal with splenda to </v>

518
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:07.570
<v Speaker 4>keep people from knowing about Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

519
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.860
<v Speaker 4>Suppressing knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dog suppressing that herbal goodness.</v>

520
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.960
<v Speaker 4>Stevie is delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>

521
00:23:13.961 --> 00:23:15.610
<v Speaker 4>It took me a little while to get used to</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

522
00:23:15.611 --> 00:23:20.611
<v Speaker 4>but knowing that it's an herbal </v>
<v Speaker 4>sweetener and then if there's like </v>

523
00:23:20.611 --> 00:23:23.500
<v Speaker 4>literally no strings attached,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just your body takes it in.</v>

524
00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.680
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem to have any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My talent truth as it seemed to have any</v>

525
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:27.190
<v Speaker 4>health</v>

<v Speaker 2>I heard some stuff in that.</v>

527
00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.330
<v Speaker 2>That's why people were telling me to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to something else.</v>

528
00:23:32.331 --> 00:23:36.380
<v Speaker 2>That other one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like with x or aZ or a Xavier.</v>

531
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.060
<v Speaker 2>There was a reason that people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying something recently about Stevia.</v>

532
00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God is like,</v>

544
00:24:17.741 --> 00:24:19.340
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was worse than getting off </v>

545
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.070
<v Speaker 3>not having like Chinese food or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something with a coat.</v>

<v Speaker 4>March,</v>

581
00:26:05.991 --> 00:26:06.260
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

583
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:09.240

<v Speaker 3>In March,</v>

584
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:14.460
<v Speaker 4>remember that time back when you were </v>

<v Speaker 4>video about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he took his shirt off in the </v>

587
00:26:19.921 --> 00:26:19.921
<v Speaker 4>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dancing around.</v>

588
00:26:19.921 --> 00:26:24.690
<v Speaker 4>Remember that guy who was hammered and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then he gave me a big hug and then he </v>

589
00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:29.240
<v Speaker 4>was so ridiculously hammered and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>after the show we found them in the </v>

590
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.030
<v Speaker 4>parking lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blood all over his face,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

675
00:30:12.681 --> 00:30:16.330
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if Vegas was was really smoothly run,</v>

676
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.850
<v Speaker 4>there would be a real comedy scene </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

677
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't be.</v>

678
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.980
<v Speaker 4>You're dealing with all these tourists </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are coming in from out of town on a</v>

679
00:30:23.981 --> 00:30:26.950
<v Speaker 4>regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have to be on the strip.</v>

680
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:30.220
<v Speaker 4>If you have one good spot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like think of like that steak joint,</v>

681
00:30:30.221 --> 00:30:35.221
<v Speaker 4>that Brazilian place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We go to Texas de Brazil with the True </v>

682
00:30:35.221 --> 00:30:35.640
<v Speaker 4>House Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's nowhere near the strip.</v>

683
00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.960
<v Speaker 4>It's way the fuck out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's somewhere in another,</v>

684
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:42.961
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of it's not near the casinos but </v>

685
00:30:42.961 --> 00:30:45.630
<v Speaker 4>everybody goes there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody goes there because it's good </v>

686
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:45.630
<v Speaker 4>because they know it's there and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

687
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:47.200
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people in town in Vegas that are</v>

688
00:30:47.201 --> 00:30:52.201
<v Speaker 4>always looking to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know the casinos would like to keep </v>

689
00:30:52.201 --> 00:30:54.960
<v Speaker 4>the shows in the casinos and it's great </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do the joint man.</v>

690
00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.860
<v Speaker 4>We had a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was perfect for us.</v>

691
00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:02.100
<v Speaker 4>But like for like the local comics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there should be a few comedy clubs </v>

692
00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.640
<v Speaker 4>in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like you could have like a real</v>

693
00:31:03.641 --> 00:31:06.850
<v Speaker 4>local scene in vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe this is embarrassing.</v>

694
00:31:06.851 --> 00:31:08.450
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate to say this because people didn't</v>

695
00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:08.780
<v Speaker 4>pick up.</v>

696
00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:14.340
<v Speaker 4>We walked past bread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like we ain't going to break down.</v>

697
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.500
<v Speaker 4>Nobody goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not going because they don't know.</v>

698
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:23.520
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't say that because not Dunkin </v>

699
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:23.520
<v Speaker 4>does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he likes it.</v>

700
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:23.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why.</v>

701
00:31:23.921 --> 00:31:25.530
<v Speaker 4>But it's like they'll never quite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't wiggle.</v>

702
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:26.950
<v Speaker 4>It was because we're too dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>

703
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:31.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that he just likes a certain </v>

704
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:33.871
<v Speaker 4>style and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Adam Hunter did it and he liked </v>

705
00:31:33.871 --> 00:31:33.871
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He asked me,</v>

706
00:31:33.871 --> 00:31:35.050
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I see it I'm like,</v>

707
00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.440

<v Speaker 4>I never even thinking.</v>

708
00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:41.490
<v Speaker 4>I always assumed that I'm to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the La Dee la comedy club hit </v>

<v Speaker 4>You know the La Comedy Club?</v>

711

<v Speaker 4>There's a void in that town.</v>

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:33.550
<v Speaker 4>If you live there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were there,</v>

732
00:32:33.551 --> 00:32:34.840

<v Speaker 4>Brian has the baddest bitches.</v>

734
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:39.770
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 50 years.</v>

735
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 4>A lot</v>

736
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.570
<v Speaker 3>of fun in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She is.</v>

737
00:32:41.571 --> 00:32:43.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might want to go to Vegas.</v>

738
00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:44.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get older.</v>

739
00:32:44.561 --> 00:32:46.280
<v Speaker 3>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to do Monday through Saturday?</v>

740
00:32:46.281 --> 00:32:47.990
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't stay in the casino,</v>

741
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:49.850
<v Speaker 3>Joel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course I live 45 minutes.</v>

742
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:53.720
<v Speaker 3>I would not be my life at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like when I heard Roseanne Barr,</v>

743
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.180
<v Speaker 3>she's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

744
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.430
<v Speaker 3>She lives in Vegas now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

745
00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.270
<v Speaker 3>I guess you commute to stays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to day a week.</v>

746
00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.100
<v Speaker 3>She does the whole week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Virginia Masada,</v>

747
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.890
<v Speaker 3>the whole week Monday crew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She does the 8:00</v>

748
00:33:03.891 --> 00:33:07.460
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then one clocks on a lineup comes in and</v>

749
00:33:07.461 --> 00:33:12.461
<v Speaker 3>they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of people like that do just </v>

750
00:33:12.461 --> 00:33:13.070
<v Speaker 3>change it to 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

751
00:33:13.071 --> 00:33:18.071
<v Speaker 3>Bobby couldn't make it work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes a certain comment to make it </v>

752
00:33:18.071 --> 00:33:18.730
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hotel has to get behind you.</v>

753
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.960
<v Speaker 3>They just say what it used to be dog.</v>

754
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:26.230
<v Speaker 3>It's not like I read an article at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC brings how much money per weekend </v>

755
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:27.740
<v Speaker 3>when there's a vegas and went to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollars.</v>

756
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:29.840
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a management and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

757
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:31.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see it.</v>

758
00:33:31.101 --> 00:33:36.101
<v Speaker 3>I see the fucking concessions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You the cheerleading competition from </v>

759
00:33:36.101 --> 00:33:37.430
<v Speaker 3>Ogallala,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nebraska and that type of stuff.</v>

760
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.860
<v Speaker 3>This is the new website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

761
00:33:38.861 --> 00:33:42.140
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>disgusting that it's illegal in New York</v>

762
00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:45.350
<v Speaker 3>because they would make so much money </v>
<v Speaker 3>from having a UFC there.</v>

763
00:33:45.351 --> 00:33:48.230
<v Speaker 3>It would generate so much revenue for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the city.</v>

764
00:33:48.231 --> 00:33:53.231
<v Speaker 3>It would be fantastic and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these dirty unions have kept it out for </v>

765
00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:57.520
<v Speaker 3>for that long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really kind of tackle UFC at </v>

766
00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.491
<v Speaker 3>Madison Square Garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just close your fucking eyes for five </v>

767
00:34:00.491 --> 00:34:03.280
<v Speaker 3>fucking minutes on my palms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First we get a steak with lobster on it </v>

768
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.310
<v Speaker 3>or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lobster fucking bisque.</v>

769
00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:06.490
<v Speaker 3>How Salad we shoot over.</v>

770
00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:10.030
<v Speaker 3>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A wedge from Brooklyn.</v>

771
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.380
<v Speaker 3>We get out of that motherfucking UFC </v>
<v Speaker 3>11:00</v>

772
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:16.240
<v Speaker 3>because the UFC ends at one and we'd be </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking out of the garden.</v>

773
00:34:16.241 --> 00:34:21.241
<v Speaker 3>That one fucking 30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like walking into your oyster </v>

774
00:34:21.241 --> 00:34:22.970
<v Speaker 3>oyster of life.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We'd go to China town.</v>

<v Speaker 4>where we went outside.</v>

827
00:36:37.321 --> 00:36:39.530
<v Speaker 4>We had some Asian food after the show </v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

828
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:44.600
<v Speaker 4>as we left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we went outside the door and they had a </v>

829
00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.270
<v Speaker 4>aquarium drive by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>filled with strippers.</v>

830
00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.840
<v Speaker 4>Let's remember that we got a video of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the truck.</v>

831
00:36:48.841 --> 00:36:50.810
<v Speaker 4>It's on youtube somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

832
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.370
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this truck pulled up.</v>

833
00:36:52.371 --> 00:36:57.371
<v Speaker 4>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the craziest thing I've ever </v>

834
00:36:57.371 --> 00:36:59.451
<v Speaker 4>seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the cops would pull up aside and me </v>

835
00:36:59.451 --> 00:36:59.451
<v Speaker 4>hit the lights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell everybody,</v>

836
00:36:59.451 --> 00:36:59.880
<v Speaker 4>sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sit down.</v>

837
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.950
<v Speaker 4>Because they're only allowed to dance </v>
<v Speaker 4>when the,</v>

838
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:07.200
<v Speaker 4>when the truck's not moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they had seat belts they would have </v>

839
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.131
<v Speaker 4>to wear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a pole and just like some </v>

840
00:37:10.131 --> 00:37:10.990
<v Speaker 4>seats and like little tiny seats with </v>
<v Speaker 4>seat belts.</v>

841
00:37:10.991 --> 00:37:13.140
<v Speaker 4>And the fucking cops would pull up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hit the lights,</v>

842
00:37:13.141 --> 00:37:18.141
<v Speaker 4>go a pseudo this girls dancing on a pole</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the back of a fucking man.</v>

843
00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.140
<v Speaker 4>And all I could think of was imagining </v>
<v Speaker 4>life from their eyes.</v>

844
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:27.500
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're naked and you're just driving </v>

845
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.060
<v Speaker 4>around like bait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're like,</v>

846
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:33.090
<v Speaker 4>like they're chumming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're chumming the whole city to try </v>

847
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:36.180
<v Speaker 4>to get them into this club and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it by putting bait in a box.</v>

848
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:41.630
<v Speaker 4>Like that's what people had been reduced</v>
<v Speaker 4>to like a woman in the smallest amount </v>

849
00:37:42.331 --> 00:37:45.960
<v Speaker 4>of clothes legally possible with </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous shoes that,</v>

850
00:37:45.961 --> 00:37:48.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she can't run good end and she's dancing</v>

851
00:37:48.871 --> 00:37:51.480
<v Speaker 4>around on a poll asking you to come with</v>
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>

852
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.390
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>

853
00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.930
<v Speaker 4>Fucking fish tank full of checks.</v>

854
00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the playboy mansion and I got </v>

855
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.490
<v Speaker 2>to see all his rare birds and they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

856
00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:08.580
<v Speaker 2>he has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like the largest collector of rare </v>

857
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:08.580
<v Speaker 2>birds ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

858
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:08.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

859
00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.720
<v Speaker 2>and you walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's the number one,</v>

860
00:38:10.721 --> 00:38:12.910
<v Speaker 2>but maybe in California or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

861
00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:19.620
<v Speaker 2>but when you walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's these birds there that don't </v>

862
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:19.620
<v Speaker 2>even look like real birds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was saying,</v>

863
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.130
<v Speaker 2>thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't even seen that before,</v>

864
00:38:21.131 --> 00:38:24.820
<v Speaker 2>like in a book or a magazine or on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you saw it in person,</v>

865
00:38:24.821 --> 00:38:27.490
<v Speaker 2>it just seemed like it was fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so awesome.</v>

866
00:38:27.491 --> 00:38:29.860
<v Speaker 2>He has the coolest animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like monkeys,</v>

867
00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:34.890
<v Speaker 2>collections that I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's these monkeys that look like old </v>

868

<v Speaker 2>men that just come up and to go out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have these beards and like these </v>

869
00:38:37.771 --> 00:38:37.771
<v Speaker 2>mustache and look like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

870
00:38:37.771 --> 00:38:41.170
<v Speaker 2>like Samurais freak you out that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are locked in a little cage?</v>

871
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:43.750
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're humongous cages.</v>

872
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was like having a cage be like </v>

873

<v Speaker 2>tour.</v>

875
00:38:52.691 --> 00:38:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Like most times you go to the playboy </v>
<v Speaker 2>mansion,</v>

<v Speaker 2>a small piece of it.</v>

878
00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.030
<v Speaker 2>I was there with friends with a family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The girl I was with,</v>

879
00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:03.880

<v Speaker 2>I don't even think I saw it all.</v>

882
00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:13.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean I walk for long periods of times </v>
<v Speaker 2>on these paths where they would have </v>

883
00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:17.131
<v Speaker 2>like these little benches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like blowjobs stations and then go for </v>

884
00:39:17.131 --> 00:39:19.990
<v Speaker 2>another mile down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that place would be expensive as</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people.</v>

889
00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:32.980

<v Speaker 2>it's to run your house.</v>

890
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.860

<v Speaker 3>they should just pick those places up </v>

895
00:39:45.771 --> 00:39:49.670
<v Speaker 3>and put them together so people could </v>
<v Speaker 3>see that for centuries when the world </v>

896
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:53.991
<v Speaker 3>ends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it because that's one of the most </v>

897
00:39:53.991 --> 00:39:55.230
<v Speaker 3>interesting places in the world.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But that place,</v>

951
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:23.260
<v Speaker 3>that place is very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I went there with a complete </v>

952
00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:23.690
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I did the comedy for time,</v>

953
00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:28.700
<v Speaker 3>like estate years ago on Fridays and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>go and hang out and some of it I can't </v>

954
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:28.970
<v Speaker 3>lie to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not my cup of tea,</v>

955
00:42:28.971 --> 00:42:31.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to suck my dick or you're</v>

956
00:42:31.491 --> 00:42:36.491
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna walk around naked and </v>

957
00:42:36.491 --> 00:42:36.491
<v Speaker 3>talk to me like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

958
00:42:36.491 --> 00:42:39.210
<v Speaker 3>But these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these savages where you know,</v>

959
00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:41.870
<v Speaker 3>and it was just peep when you're looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>at them and you feel bad,</v>

960
00:42:41.871 --> 00:42:43.680
<v Speaker 3>but they're having a great time and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have like,</v>

961
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:48.110
<v Speaker 3>people come up there with the illusion </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they gotta meet playmates,</v>

962
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they had guys on this shit.</v>

963
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.350
<v Speaker 3>Polyester suits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three piece,</v>

964
00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.700
<v Speaker 3>the shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>

965
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:58.310
<v Speaker 3>it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you look at that place,</v>

966
00:42:58.311 --> 00:42:59.960
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what really went on in that?</v>

967
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:01.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting to me,</v>

968
00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.340
<v Speaker 4>it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I think about it,</v>

969
00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:08.460
<v Speaker 4>the playboy mansion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that it's sort of like the last sort </v>

970
00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.600
<v Speaker 4>of house like that have a however it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not going to exist anymore.</v>

971
00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:15.720
<v Speaker 4>I think it's gonna be a museum because </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was walking through I felt very </v>

972
00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.030
<v Speaker 4>like I could see this being a chippy </v>
<v Speaker 4>kinda.</v>

973
00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:16.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you cannot.</v>

974
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.320
<v Speaker 4>Then that's not disrespectful at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that no one,</v>

975
00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:23.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe someone could do something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that in the future where they could</v>

976
00:43:23.711 --> 00:43:27.250
<v Speaker 4>create like a whole destination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's a destination.</v>

977
00:43:27.251 --> 00:43:29.620
<v Speaker 4>It's not just a house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not just the business.</v>

978
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.000
<v Speaker 4>Like it would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

979
00:43:31.001 --> 00:43:33.580
<v Speaker 4>there's the strikeforce fights this </v>
<v Speaker 4>weekend at the playboy mansion.</v>

00:43:33.581 --> 00:43:35.940
<v Speaker 4>Like they had fights there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We went to watch fight there.</v>

981
00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:37.870
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had a,</v>

982
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.450
<v Speaker 4>they had more than one mixed martial </v>
<v Speaker 4>arts event.</v>

983
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:45.500
<v Speaker 4>They're having kids though and his sons </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think they're going to take over.</v>

984
00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey look like young versions of him.</v>

985
00:43:48.221 --> 00:43:50.830
<v Speaker 4>Like I could see them just stepping in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and being like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>fucking pimps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they haven't makes sense.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>business in the family?</v>

<v Speaker 4>management with a whole playboy thing.</v>

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:19.360
<v Speaker 3>They did two movies that star ready with</v>
<v Speaker 3>this broad and they did a different one </v>

1040
00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.690
<v Speaker 3>with the guy from the general hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the older guy that I married on </v>

1041
00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:28.080
<v Speaker 3>June,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you remember when they cut his thumb </v>

1042
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:28.710
<v Speaker 3>off public?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to take my thumb.</v>

1043
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:32.270
<v Speaker 3>Chocolate Gum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dog.</v>

1044
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:37.390
<v Speaker 3>But he's shown the monologue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he says to Mickey Rourke when he </v>

1045
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:37.390
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

1046
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:38.530
<v Speaker 3>Here you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She left me.</v>

1047
00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Go what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

1048
00:46:40.141 --> 00:46:41.490
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1049
00:46:41.491 --> 00:46:43.190
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just breaks it down and go.</v>

1050
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:48.230
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they try to embarrass you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a backhand them and you look </v>

1051
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:49.140
<v Speaker 3>into the face and tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't look at nobody.</v>

1052
00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:54.350
<v Speaker 3>You don't say good night to nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That whole little monologue at that </v>

1053
00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:55.340
<v Speaker 3>again was excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excellent.</v>

1054
00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.510
<v Speaker 3>He was a really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good actor.</v>

1055
00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:02.720
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's weird when you see him </v>
<v Speaker 3>like one day and that crazy karate </v>

1056
00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:06.651
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that Shit I just played in </v>

1057
00:47:06.651 --> 00:47:06.651
<v Speaker 3>karate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Masters backfires too.</v>

1058
00:47:06.651 --> 00:47:10.530
<v Speaker 3>As satisfying as you ready for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just saw them motherfucking audition </v>

1059
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:15.470
<v Speaker 3>about eight weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really understand for what additionally </v>

1060
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:16.160
<v Speaker 3>for Costar like me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1061
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:17.880
<v Speaker 3>so that's how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1062
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.230
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>

1063
00:47:19.231 --> 00:47:24.231
<v Speaker 3>How does a guy who's that talented and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was in that Sylvester stallone movie </v>

1064
00:47:24.231 --> 00:47:25.220
<v Speaker 3>recently?</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1068
00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:31.780
<v Speaker 4>He was in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't.</v>

1069
00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:34.930
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1070
00:47:34.931 --> 00:47:37.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure he was the bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was fucking excellent guy.</v>

1071
00:47:37.691 --> 00:47:41.100
<v Speaker 4>Can Act as Asada and insisted on them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

1072
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:43.510
<v Speaker 4>I know that when he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they were doing,</v>

1073
00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:48.840
<v Speaker 4>you know who his daughter is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the chicken blow the little girl in </v>

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:48.840
<v Speaker 4>blow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the movie?</v>

1075
00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.981
<v Speaker 4>Love with that little girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then she went out to be a Disney </v>

1076
00:47:52.981 --> 00:47:53.200
<v Speaker 4>star.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a Disney store.</v>

1077
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:55.480
<v Speaker 4>Look at Rob Redman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like some Disney check.</v>

1078
00:47:55.930 --> 00:48:00.820
<v Speaker 4>But supposedly when they shoot at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>studios they have security that he can't</v>

1079
00:48:00.821 --> 00:48:03.400
<v Speaker 4>come on the set.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's Julia Roberts.</v>

1080
00:48:03.401 --> 00:48:08.401
<v Speaker 4>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Julia Roberts really like fucking </v>

1081
00:48:08.401 --> 00:48:08.590
<v Speaker 4>with security on him and stuff because </v>
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

1082
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:11.440
<v Speaker 4>they try to keep her away from him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the whole story.</v>

1083
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:15.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm just telling you what I heard second</v>
<v Speaker 4>hand when she shoots movies or TV shows.</v>

1084
00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:21.440
<v Speaker 4>There's something going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly what the fuck the </v>

1085
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:21.440
<v Speaker 4>thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's really cute kid.</v>

1086
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:26.160
<v Speaker 4>She was a cute girl and blow that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He tells you he's going to meet her at </v>

1087
00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:26.160
<v Speaker 4>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing.</v>

1088
00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.620
<v Speaker 4>Well when he was on celebrity rehab it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was very strange.</v>

1089
00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.540
<v Speaker 4>It just didn't make any sense that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was there.</v>

1090
00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:36.650
<v Speaker 4>Like it seemed like he just needed a </v>
<v Speaker 4>break and didn't really enjoy Robert's </v>

1091
00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:39.270
<v Speaker 4>Emma Roberts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Roberts.</v>

1092
00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:40.260
<v Speaker 4>She's real cute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1093
00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:45.940
<v Speaker 4>Young girl has got to be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whenever someone going to rehab for re </v>

1094
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:49.110
<v Speaker 4>we'd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're really almost need like a </v>

1095
00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:49.110
<v Speaker 4>behavior or break the need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you know,</v>

1096
00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:52.870
<v Speaker 4>you go into Rehab for life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're off the rails for everything.</v>

1097
00:48:52.871 --> 00:48:53.620
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1098
00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.320
<v Speaker 4>if you really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go into a rehab for weed,</v>

1099
00:48:56.321 --> 00:48:58.760
<v Speaker 4>it's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just need to go somewhere.</v>

1100
00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:03.010
<v Speaker 4>Do you think there's certain cases that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could see going to rehab her way,</v>

1101
00:49:03.011 --> 00:49:04.480
<v Speaker 4>like people like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1102
00:49:04.481 --> 00:49:09.481
<v Speaker 4>like went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ralphie may used to be at his prime </v>

1103
00:49:09.481 --> 00:49:09.481
<v Speaker 4>where he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seriously smoking,</v>

1104
00:49:09.481 --> 00:49:10.350
<v Speaker 4>like two pounds of weed a day or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1105
00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.400
<v Speaker 4>He's a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1106
00:49:12.401 --> 00:49:14.380
<v Speaker 4>and no disrespect to Ralphie but look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1107
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:17.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's obviously a very impulsive</v>

1108
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:20.230
<v Speaker 4>person and that's where I think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably,</v>

1109
00:49:20.231 --> 00:49:22.660
<v Speaker 4>you're not dealing with just the wheat </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself,</v>

1110
00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:26.130
<v Speaker 4>dealing with life in general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's this look,</v>

1111
00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:31.140
<v Speaker 4>we're all impulsive standup comedians </v>
<v Speaker 4>and some most impulsive people to </v>

1112
00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:34.330
<v Speaker 4>something about the type of person that </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks to say the,</v>

1113
00:49:34.331 --> 00:49:38.680
<v Speaker 4>some of the shit that we say like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way your brain works this word.</v>

1114
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.410
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like an instinct for us to </v>
<v Speaker 4>just be wacky.</v>

1115
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:42.130
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1116
00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:42.730
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1117
00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:48.090
<v Speaker 4>so when you get a guy that like is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>standup comedian and then you find out </v>

1118
00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:49.300
<v Speaker 4>he's a gambling addict,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's never a shock.</v>

1119
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.250
<v Speaker 4>It's never a shock when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1120
00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:52.690
<v Speaker 4>you find out they're blowing all their </v>
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>

1121
00:49:52.691 --> 00:49:57.691
<v Speaker 4>betting on sports,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's normal Mcdonald's or blow all </v>

1122
00:49:57.691 --> 00:49:58.840
<v Speaker 4>their money on for years.</v>

1123
00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:04.500
<v Speaker 4>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about I locked myself in my house </v>

1124
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:04.570
<v Speaker 4>and I played quake for 12 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fucking idiot,</v>

1125
00:50:04.571 --> 00:50:05.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the same thing.</v>

1126
00:50:05.771 --> 00:50:10.771
<v Speaker 4>It's like we get impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have this like almost uncontrollable </v>

1127
00:50:10.771 --> 00:50:11.500
<v Speaker 4>desire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be sitting around.</v>

1128
00:50:11.501 --> 00:50:16.501
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would be sitting around doing </v>

1129
00:50:16.501 --> 00:50:16.501
<v Speaker 4>something else and all I could think of </v>
<v Speaker 4>was getting back to my computer.</v>

1130
00:50:16.501 --> 00:50:21.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to get online and play some </v>

1131
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.921
<v Speaker 4>quake and everything will be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Loaded myself up with caffeine and why?</v>

1132
00:50:22.991 --> 00:50:25.330
<v Speaker 4>Because it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's part of being a comedian,</v>

1133
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:26.410
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

1134
00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:31.420
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of understand comedians being </v>

1135
00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.660
<v Speaker 4>caught up in almost any like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nutty impulse like that,</v>

1136
00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:38.800
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana really going to go to rehab </v>

1137
00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:38.800
<v Speaker 4>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to rehab for lifestyle.</v>

1138
00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:42.940
<v Speaker 4>That's what you do in life itself is </v>
<v Speaker 4>just too slippery right now and need a </v>

1139
00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:42.940
<v Speaker 4>break,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is understandable.</v>

1140
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.830
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to go to Rehab for Jack Daniels.</v>

1141
00:50:45.831 --> 00:50:48.210
<v Speaker 4>I think she really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How often you've been drinking?</v>

1142
00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:48.610
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1143
00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:51.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean not for drinking in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I,</v>

1144
00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:55.070
<v Speaker 4>I try not to drink Jack Daniels now and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like I miss it so much.</v>

1145
00:50:55.071 --> 00:51:00.071
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard not to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never drink Jack Daniels my whole </v>

1146
00:51:00.071 --> 00:51:00.071
<v Speaker 4>entire life except for like the last,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1147
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:05.410
<v Speaker 4>Seven months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Coincidentally the last year of your </v>

1148
00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:05.410
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've been balling out of control.</v>

1149
00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:07.240
<v Speaker 4>You're going out layers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scared style son.</v>

1150

<v Speaker 4>Alabama.</v>

<v Speaker 4>of it that they made.</v>

00:56:02.251 --> 00:56:05.490
<v Speaker 4>Goes tomorrow night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see you tomorrow night.</v>

1267
00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:07.020
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not scared of you.</v>

1268
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.410
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't scared of a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He really wasn't.</v>

1269
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:13.080
<v Speaker 4>And that was the difference on Saturday </v>
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>

1270
00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:16.200
<v Speaker 4>He really wasn't scared of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knocked him the fuck out.</v>

1271
00:56:16.201 --> 00:56:21.201
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was crazy to watch like Anderson </v>

1272
00:56:21.201 --> 00:56:23.481
<v Speaker 4>fucked around like he normally does and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like he eat more so than he normally </v>

1273
00:56:23.481 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 4>does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He humiliates guys with that.</v>

1274
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.140
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a real tactic,</v>

1275
00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:31.390
<v Speaker 4>but you got to absolutely know what your</v>
<v Speaker 4>opponent can and can't do.</v>

1276
00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:36.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe he could've gotten away </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that with like a lesser guy or a </v>

1277
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:39.751
<v Speaker 4>guy who's like easily be fuddled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of the things they didn't </v>

1278
00:56:39.751 --> 00:56:41.050
<v Speaker 4>Weidman's campus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had people imitate that.</v>

1279
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:46.230
<v Speaker 4>They had people like taunt him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had people spar with him and like </v>

1280
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:50.490
<v Speaker 4>pretend they were falling down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>dropping their hands and poking their </v>

1281
00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:54.091
<v Speaker 4>face out and juking them and poc shot </v>
<v Speaker 4>and them and shit and doing all this </v>

1282
00:56:54.091 --> 00:56:54.900
<v Speaker 4>stuff that Anderson always does because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets you in,</v>

1283
00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:57.580
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a defensive shell.</v>

1284
00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:01.720
<v Speaker 4>He gets you frozen up because he moves </v>
<v Speaker 4>really fast and one of his tactics,</v>

1285
00:57:01.721 --> 00:57:06.721
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he will talk you a little bit and then </v>

1286
00:57:06.721 --> 00:57:06.721
<v Speaker 4>blast on you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll blast on you can,</v>

1287
00:57:06.721 --> 00:57:08.860
<v Speaker 4>he can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could cover distance like deceptively</v>

1288
00:57:08.861 --> 00:57:09.370
<v Speaker 4>fast.</v>

1289
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:14.670
<v Speaker 4>So he's really good at closing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>distance and crack and dudes and </v>

1290
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:18.481
<v Speaker 4>sometimes he can knock them out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes like the Vito Belfort shot or </v>

1291
00:57:18.481 --> 00:57:20.050
<v Speaker 4>sometimes he just lights you up like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>

1292
00:57:20.051 --> 00:57:22.170
<v Speaker 4>A few exchanges with Chris liebing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1293
00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:23.530
<v Speaker 4>just lit him up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lift him up,</v>

1294
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:25.950
<v Speaker 4>lift him up again before you eventually </v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped him.</v>

1295
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:29.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean ashland is a fucking tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 4>talent,</v>

1296
00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:33.850
<v Speaker 4>but that dropping of the hands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll leave yourself so vulnerable that</v>

1297
00:57:33.851 --> 00:57:37.030
<v Speaker 4>even a tremendous talent like him can </v>
<v Speaker 4>get knocked the fuck out,</v>

1298
00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:40.480
<v Speaker 4>and that's one of the big lessons of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Saturday night.</v>

1299
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:44.020
<v Speaker 4>The big lesson is everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable.</v>

1300
00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:48.940
<v Speaker 4>Even the best guys are human beings and </v>
<v Speaker 4>a human being as vulnerable.</v>

1301
00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:53.140
<v Speaker 4>The whole ideas and not get hit and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't matter who the human being is.</v>

1302
00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:58.260
<v Speaker 4>If their skill levels really high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't prevent them from being </v>

1303
00:57:58.260 --> 00:57:59.020
<v Speaker 4>damaged by a solid punch.</v>

1304
00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:01.480
<v Speaker 4>Everybody gets fucked up by a solid </v>
<v Speaker 4>shot.</v>

1305
00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.000
<v Speaker 4>Everybody who gets kicked in the head </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes to sleep.</v>

1306
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:05.290
<v Speaker 4>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll kicked in the head.</v>

1307
00:58:05.291 --> 00:58:07.510
<v Speaker 4>You go night night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It happens to everybody.</v>

1308
00:58:07.511 --> 00:58:10.720
<v Speaker 4>It happens to the best people in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world and that was like a big lesson.</v>

1309
00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:15.780
<v Speaker 4>Saturday night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the auditory beer really just shut the </v>

1310
00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:15.780
<v Speaker 4>fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't.</v>

1311
00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:17.120
<v Speaker 4>It was weird because the room I was in </v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped.</v>

1312
00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:18.840
<v Speaker 4>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stopped.</v>

1313
00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:22.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just stopped and it was a,</v>

1314
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:24.930
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's good for everybody now.</v>

1315
00:58:24.931 --> 00:58:29.931
<v Speaker 4>Now they start from scratch again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is going to be interesting whether </v>

1316
00:58:29.931 --> 00:58:30.750
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to set up the rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1317
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:34.810
<v Speaker 4>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the word is online for um,</v>

1318
00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:37.650
<v Speaker 4>the new year's show which is December </v>
<v Speaker 4>28th,</v>

1319
00:58:37.810 --> 00:58:42.520
<v Speaker 4>which would be guess Matt Desk Job </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ideas.</v>

1320
00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:46.360
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what kind of hype and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>guarantee you in a rematch.</v>

1321
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:51.600
<v Speaker 4>Anderson Silva is gonna dot his i's and </v>
<v Speaker 4>cross his teeth first knockout though </v>

1322
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:53.830
<v Speaker 4>he's never been knocked out his entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>career.</v>

1323
00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:58.860
<v Speaker 4>People usually get that after time they </v>
<v Speaker 4>become,</v>

1324
00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:00.910
<v Speaker 4>they become vulnerable and they become </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings.</v>

1325
00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:06.060
<v Speaker 4>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reality is if you get knocked out </v>

1326
00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:09.271
<v Speaker 4>it's easier to get knocked out again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And who knows what's happened in </v>

1327
00:59:09.271 --> 00:59:09.430
<v Speaker 4>training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1328
00:59:09.431 --> 00:59:14.431
<v Speaker 4>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's sparring with like really high </v>

1329
00:59:14.431 --> 00:59:14.440
<v Speaker 4>level guys and training on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 4>basis.</v>

1330
00:59:14.770 --> 00:59:15.900
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's probably with,</v>

1331
00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:18.810
<v Speaker 4>with Machida,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with Fazio,</v>

1332
00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:23.000
<v Speaker 4>like there's a lot of those black house </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys that are fucking bad ass beasts,</v>

1333
00:59:23.350 --> 00:59:28.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like who knows who's tagging him in the </v>

1334
00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:28.350
<v Speaker 4>gym,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when you're doing long,</v>

1335
00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:32.141
<v Speaker 4>hard rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So everyone turns 38 at one point in </v>

1336
00:59:32.141 --> 00:59:35.450
<v Speaker 4>their life and Anderson Silva's 38.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to think about that as well,</v>

1337
00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.760
<v Speaker 4>but you don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I was growing up it was 35,</v>

1338
00:59:38.530 --> 00:59:40.790
<v Speaker 4>35,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we both discussed this.</v>

1339
00:59:40.791 --> 00:59:43.460
<v Speaker 4>Look at our board is 42.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about.</v>

1340
00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:44.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about Bernard?</v>

1341
00:59:44.871 --> 00:59:49.360
<v Speaker 4>Hopkins is 43.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I was talking about I think.</v>

1342
00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.590
<v Speaker 4>And this one's got three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three more.</v>

1343
00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:52.250
<v Speaker 4>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

1344
00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.360
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Battles left.</v>

1345
00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.520
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

1346
00:59:55.521 --> 00:59:58.340
<v Speaker 4>They are even more if he fight smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you something,</v>

1347
00:59:58.341 --> 01:00:00.020
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before he got knocked out,</v>

1348
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:04.220
<v Speaker 4>he was looking lightning fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was slamming leg kicks in.</v>

1349
01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:06.770
<v Speaker 4>He avoided being submitted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got back up to his feet.</v>

1350
01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:08.960
<v Speaker 4>He got out of a heel hook and got back </v>
<v Speaker 4>up to his feet.</v>

1351
01:00:08.961 --> 01:00:13.961
<v Speaker 4>It's not like Anderson looked bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what he did was he does what he </v>

1352
01:00:13.961 --> 01:00:13.961
<v Speaker 4>does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1353
01:00:13.961 --> 01:00:14.810
<v Speaker 4>that taunting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1354
01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:16.460
<v Speaker 4>when he knocks the guy out because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1355
01:00:16.461 --> 01:00:19.460
<v Speaker 4>it's awesome and it looks great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you get knocked out,</v>

1356
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:21.260
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like that commercial,</v>

1357
01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:26.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that nos commercial of the guy who does </v>

1358
01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.841
<v Speaker 4>these flippy kicks and the other guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>just blasted him on a change is called </v>

1359
01:00:28.841 --> 01:00:30.950
<v Speaker 4>them and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's um,</v>

1360
01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:36.070
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a reason why that's in a </v>

1361
01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:36.070
<v Speaker 4>commercial.</v>

1362
01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:37.790
<v Speaker 4>That whole scene plays out in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>commercial as sweet justice,</v>

1363
01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:43.140
<v Speaker 4>like justice to the guy who taunts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why the whole crowd was </v>

1364
01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.660
<v Speaker 4>booing Anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were booing.</v>

1365
01:00:44.661 --> 01:00:47.150
<v Speaker 4>Anderson with Anderson got knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1366
01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.010
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's weird.</v>

1367
01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:54.200
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a natural reaction that they </v>

1368
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:54.200
<v Speaker 4>had no one told them that they had to </v>
<v Speaker 4>bu.</v>

1369
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:59.140
<v Speaker 4>But there was a lot of people booing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a tremendous amount of people </v>

1370
01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:01.190
<v Speaker 4>booing the best fighter in history </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he got caught.</v>

1371
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.950
<v Speaker 4>And I think that is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1372
01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.940
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they felt,</v>

1373
01:01:04.941 --> 01:01:09.941
<v Speaker 4>he let them down because he got knocked </v>
<v Speaker 4>out doing something stupid and they're </v>

1374
01:01:09.941 --> 01:01:10.610
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1375
01:01:10.611 --> 01:01:14.090
<v Speaker 4>what did you do man booboo?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

1376
01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:15.110
<v Speaker 4>what happened to him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

1377
01:01:15.111 --> 01:01:17.100
<v Speaker 4>I just lost the title.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1378
01:01:17.101 --> 01:01:22.101
<v Speaker 4>he made an ass load of money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he just lost the title in </v>

<v Speaker 4>empathy like big people.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He was insane.</v>

1429
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:20.950
<v Speaker 4>He tried to cartwheel care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1430
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000
<v Speaker 4>he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went to do an upper cut and he went </v>

1431
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:26.180
<v Speaker 4>from where he faked and he came up with </v>
<v Speaker 4>an applicant.</v>

1432
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:28.050
<v Speaker 4>He did something very beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1433
01:03:28.051 --> 01:03:32.020
<v Speaker 4>he was doing a lot of beautiful shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's really crafty,</v>

1434
01:03:32.021 --> 01:03:34.850
<v Speaker 4>like he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very creative and unpredictable and he's</v>

1435
01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.070
<v Speaker 4>like fake slow and kicks high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does a lot of weird shit.</v>

1436
01:03:38.071 --> 01:03:39.530
<v Speaker 4>You don't 65 brother?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1437
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:41.220

<v Speaker 4>He's 1:45.</v>

1438
01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That adds a complete different.</v>

1439
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:45.680
<v Speaker 4>Let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just put him up against the doodle</v>

1440
01:03:45.681 --> 01:03:48.170
<v Speaker 4>wanting to fight Benson Henderson in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Minneapolis.</v>

1441
01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:51.930
<v Speaker 4>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a hell of a fight,</v>

1442
01:03:51.931 --> 01:03:52.110
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1443
01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:53.790
<v Speaker 4>Would it be a great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a fight right there.</v>

1444
01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:58.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to see a rematch with him </v>

1445
01:03:58.810 --> 01:03:58.810
<v Speaker 4>and Aldo because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1446
01:03:58.810 --> 01:03:58.980
<v Speaker 4>he fought Aldo and got caught with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>flying knee,</v>

1447
01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:01.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a double knee may,</v>

1448
01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.810
<v Speaker 4>maybe like 10 seconds into the fight was</v>
<v Speaker 4>very quick.</v>

1449
01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:09.080
<v Speaker 4>All the although jumped up and nailed </v>
<v Speaker 4>him on the forehead with a flying </v>

1450
01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:09.480
<v Speaker 4>economy open and it was nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean,</v>

1451
01:04:09.481 --> 01:04:14.481
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't get a chance to get into the </v>

1452
01:04:14.481 --> 01:04:14.481
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just got caught and I think that he's</v>

1453
01:04:14.481 --> 01:04:15.750
<v Speaker 4>a way better fighter now than he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

1454
01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:19.050
<v Speaker 4>I think it'll be really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>after watching him fight seaver like,</v>

1455
01:04:19.051 --> 01:04:20.730
<v Speaker 4>God damn man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't see her up.</v>

1456
01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:23.670
<v Speaker 4>He lifts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those combinations are insane because he</v>

1457
01:04:23.671 --> 01:04:28.671
<v Speaker 4>was so accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the last combination that he </v>

1458
01:04:28.671 --> 01:04:31.911
<v Speaker 4>knocked him out with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he hit him with like three or four </v>

1459
01:04:31.911 --> 01:04:31.911
<v Speaker 4>ridiculously accurate shots.</v>

1460
01:04:31.911 --> 01:04:36.230
<v Speaker 4>While you know it's a lot of chaos going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on and scrambling and scrambling after </v>

1461
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:38.310
<v Speaker 4>him and he's catching them on the jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a great fight.</v>

1462
01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:39.780
<v Speaker 4>It was a lot of great fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1463
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:43.350
<v Speaker 4>A lot of great fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See people didn't give tim credit.</v>

1464
01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:46.980
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy enough credit for that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not even had his back.</v>

1465
01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:50.670
<v Speaker 4>He took him down and had his back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>was slamming him in the face.</v>

1466
01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:52.320
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is going on?</v>

1467
01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.790
<v Speaker 4>It's getting punched.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's going on,</v>

1468
01:04:53.791 --> 01:04:55.410
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu is one thing,</v>

1469
01:04:55.411 --> 01:05:00.411
<v Speaker 4>but Jujitsu with punches to the face by </v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy who's a black belt in Jujitsu </v>

1470
01:05:00.411 --> 01:05:01.710
<v Speaker 4>changes the whole game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you might not be.</v>

1471
01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:06.740
<v Speaker 4>He might be better than Tim Kennedy at </v>
<v Speaker 4>straight Jujitsu if they had a regular </v>

1472
01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:10.980
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu match,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Kennedy's got a good enough to just </v>

1473
01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.090
<v Speaker 4>say that he could hang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can defend himself,</v>

1474
01:05:12.091 --> 01:05:17.091
<v Speaker 4>like he's not scared to grapple with </v>
<v Speaker 4>really high level guys any strong as </v>

1475
01:05:17.091 --> 01:05:18.580
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Kennedy is also a boxer.</v>

1476
01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:21.190
<v Speaker 4>He can hit hard and when he gets it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ground,</v>

1477
01:05:21.191 --> 01:05:24.270
<v Speaker 4>he's got real mixed martial arts skills </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it gets to the ground health thump.</v>

1478
01:05:24.271 --> 01:05:29.271
<v Speaker 4>You with punches and so the guy like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Andre is not really quite a complete mma</v>

1479
01:05:29.651 --> 01:05:32.140
<v Speaker 4>fighter yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just as brilliant Jujitsu guy who's</v>

1480
01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:35.470
<v Speaker 4>entering into mma and there's guys like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy out there.</v>

1481
01:05:35.471 --> 01:05:35.880
<v Speaker 4>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>

1482
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:40.930
<v Speaker 4>as long as they're hitting you in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>face like you're not going to submit </v>

1483
01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:43.171
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a completely different </v>

1484
01:05:43.171 --> 01:05:43.171
<v Speaker 4>ballgame.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're all dizzy and shit.</v>

1485
01:05:43.171 --> 01:05:44.380
<v Speaker 4>Your face is puffy and you can't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

1486
01:05:44.381 --> 01:05:47.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the reality of getting punched in</v>

1487
01:05:47.261 --> 01:05:48.400
<v Speaker 4>the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1488
01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:53.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't like seeing it when guys like </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good at Jujitsu and I see them </v>

1489
01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:53.850
<v Speaker 4>come to mma and they're getting fucked </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

1490
01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:59.050
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it kind of bothers me because I feel </v>

1491
01:05:59.050 --> 01:05:59.050
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1492
01:05:59.050 --> 01:05:59.050
<v Speaker 4>they're not ready yet.</v>

1493
01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:03.840
<v Speaker 4>You should have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to really enter into </v>

1494
01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:04.120
<v Speaker 4>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has to be a long term proposition and</v>

1495
01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:06.820
<v Speaker 4>you should look at it as like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are your strength?</v>

1496
01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:08.470
<v Speaker 4>Your strength is Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1497
01:06:08.471 --> 01:06:11.380
<v Speaker 4>What's your weakness?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your weakness is stand up.</v>

1498
01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to fix that.</v>

1499
01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:18.380
<v Speaker 4>You've got to fix that first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't even think about getting in </v>

1500
01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:19.750
<v Speaker 4>there unless you could fight in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing match because you're going to</v>

1501
01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:21.910
<v Speaker 4>be going right away to some of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>highest level guys.</v>

1502
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:25.300
<v Speaker 4>The world because you're hodrick racing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They take a guy like that and they don't</v>

1503
01:06:25.301 --> 01:06:27.940
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't move them along slow,</v>

1504
01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:30.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's gonna fight high level guys because</v>

1505
01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:34.480
<v Speaker 4>of his name pretty quickly and because </v>
<v Speaker 4>of his reputation in Jujitsu.</v>

1506
01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:39.840
<v Speaker 4>Whereas the reality of his striking is </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the one that is striking a few </v>

1507
01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.410
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know you need many years on the </v>

1508
01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:45.691
<v Speaker 4>books before you go and strike with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy like the Leo Machida or something </v>

1509
01:06:45.691 --> 01:06:45.691
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

1510
01:06:45.691 --> 01:06:47.020
<v Speaker 4>You just need a lot of years of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>books.</v>

1511
01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:49.630
<v Speaker 4>You have to get them because he's going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to light you up.</v>

1512
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:52.810
<v Speaker 4>It's going to hit you with he's going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pot shot you and he's going to crack you</v>

1513
01:06:52.811 --> 01:06:57.811
<v Speaker 4>and you're not going to stop him and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to hit you three or four </v>

1514
01:06:57.811 --> 01:06:58.660
<v Speaker 4>times like that and he's gonna knock you</v>
<v Speaker 4>out too.</v>

1515
01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:03.690
<v Speaker 4>Sneaky game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The striking game striking game is a </v>

1516
01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:04.690
<v Speaker 4>different game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some guys can just adapt real quick.</v>

1517
01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.290
<v Speaker 4>Like there's some Dan Henderson type </v>
<v Speaker 4>dudes that like almost right away within</v>

1518
01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:13.291
<v Speaker 4>a couple of years as dangerous as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some who's just never quite get the </v>

1519
01:07:13.291 --> 01:07:13.291
<v Speaker 4>hang of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

1520
01:07:13.291 --> 01:07:18.130
<v Speaker 4>Got picked up instantly and you see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see what gets you guys are real.</v>

1521
01:07:18.161 --> 01:07:22.810
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu guy is striking is very slow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's a new saying,</v>

1522
01:07:22.811 --> 01:07:25.180
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is he in the octagon?</v>

1523
01:07:25.181 --> 01:07:27.460
<v Speaker 4>But maybe they know something.</v>

1524
01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:32.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You went so side note something I </v>

1525
01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:32.460
<v Speaker 4>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1526
01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:35.560
<v Speaker 4>well I think we're dealing with a new </v>
<v Speaker 4>era of mixed martial arts.</v>

1527
01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people are ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>try.</v>

1528
01:07:37.271 --> 01:07:38.350
<v Speaker 4>There's that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that um,</v>

1529
01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:41.080
<v Speaker 4>although jump flying knee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch this,</v>

1530
01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:46.290
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like the first exchange of the </v>

1531
01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:46.290
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He double flying knee them in the face.</v>

1532
01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:48.250
<v Speaker 4>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cut them,</v>

1533
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:51.490
<v Speaker 4>cut them real bad over his eyebrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

1534
01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:53.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1535
01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:58.980
<v Speaker 4>but that's one of those things where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're send me anybody who gets hit by </v>

1536
01:07:58.980 --> 01:07:58.980
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a reality.</v>

1537
01:07:58.980 --> 01:07:59.410
<v Speaker 4>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1538
01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:02.110
<v Speaker 4>a lot of great guys don't get hit like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1539
01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:04.140
<v Speaker 4>but if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what would happen.</v>

1540
01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:05.560
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1541
01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:07.690
<v Speaker 4>you can't avoid that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a big lesson.</v>

1542
01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:10.270
<v Speaker 4>It's important lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saturday night,</v>

1543
01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:15.360
<v Speaker 4>important lesson for martial artist </v>
<v Speaker 4>because people like to think that </v>

1544
01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.971
<v Speaker 4>because the guy is really good that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>can somehow or another magically take </v>

1545
01:08:17.971 --> 01:08:17.971
<v Speaker 4>punishment better.</v>

1546
01:08:17.971 --> 01:08:20.120
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a fucking lesson for everybody.</v>

1547
01:08:20.121 --> 01:08:21.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a lesson for everything in life.</v>

1548
01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:25.000
<v Speaker 4>Karma is a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see it in April,</v>

1549
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.610
<v Speaker 4>you see it in basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you'll see a team that's got a</v>

1550
01:08:28.611 --> 01:08:29.780
<v Speaker 4>reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fast break,</v>

1551
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:33.140
<v Speaker 4>and all of a sudden this team that </v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody's talking about,</v>

1552
01:08:33.141 --> 01:08:38.141
<v Speaker 4>the fast break through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go into finals and the coaches say </v>

1553
01:08:38.141 --> 01:08:38.840
<v Speaker 4>fast break breaking and the team that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>been France breaking motherfuckers,</v>

1554
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:44.110
<v Speaker 4>they know how to execute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they forget how to defend the fast </v>

1555
01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:44.110
<v Speaker 4>break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They fucking lose.</v>

1556
01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:48.941
<v Speaker 4>It happens all the time and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>different types of sports in different </v>

1557
01:08:48.941 --> 01:08:48.941
<v Speaker 4>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

1558
01:08:48.941 --> 01:08:52.360
<v Speaker 4>the rematch is going to be absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinating to see what's going to </v>

1559
01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:53.990
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then to rematch with Weidman.</v>

1560
01:08:53.991 --> 01:08:57.590
<v Speaker 4>Anderson Silva will be the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 4>worry match in the history of the UFC.</v>

1561
01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:02.950
<v Speaker 4>No doubt about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everybody's going to want to know </v>

1562
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:04.400
<v Speaker 4>why men can do it again and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to want to know how Anderson going</v>

1563
01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:07.220
<v Speaker 4>to recover.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be fascinating as,</v>

1564
01:09:07.221 --> 01:09:07.880
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1565
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:10.250
<v Speaker 4>whew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be crazy.</v>

1566
01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:14.480
<v Speaker 4>I can't write out a guy like Anderson </v>
<v Speaker 4>Silva.</v>

1567
01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:19.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm right there with you watching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't 17 fights and the three or two </v>

1568
01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.660
<v Speaker 4>before that on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1569
01:09:20.661 --> 01:09:23.060
<v Speaker 4>You can't write this guy off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You cannot write him off.</v>

1570
01:09:23.330 --> 01:09:24.470
<v Speaker 4>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>however,</v>

1571
01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:26.930
<v Speaker 4>however we seen it with a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters,</v>

1572
01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.600
<v Speaker 4>age takes whatever the money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the children,</v>

1573
01:09:29.601 --> 01:09:30.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1574
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:35.390
<v Speaker 4>it's a new wage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't wait to see today I saw a </v>

1575
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.990
<v Speaker 4>picture of this gift to Sin Against Jon </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jones,</v>

1576
01:09:35.991 --> 01:09:36.850
<v Speaker 4>the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1577
01:09:37.330 --> 01:09:38.900
<v Speaker 4>the whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that fight.</v>

1578
01:09:38.901 --> 01:09:41.410
<v Speaker 4>Those are two monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Monsters.</v>

1579
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:42.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1580
01:09:42.951 --> 01:09:47.951
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the things about a guy like </v>

1581
01:09:47.951 --> 01:09:50.471
<v Speaker 4>Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're comparing them to a guy like </v>

1582
01:09:50.471 --> 01:09:50.471
<v Speaker 4>Bernard Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just 10 years older than him.</v>

1583
01:09:50.471 --> 01:09:52.700
<v Speaker 4>Watch out Bernard fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bernard Hopkins is a brilliant defensive</v>

1584
01:09:52.701 --> 01:09:53.660
<v Speaker 4>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brilliant.</v>

1585
01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:56.510
<v Speaker 4>You very rarely see Bernard Hopkins Kit </v>
<v Speaker 4>clipped,</v>

1586
01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when he gets clipped,</v>

1587
01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:01.100
<v Speaker 4>his boxing is good enough that he knows </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to go into a shell.</v>

1588
01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:06.220
<v Speaker 4>He knows how to move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows how to give you angles and he </v>

1589
01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:06.500
<v Speaker 4>gets away with Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a good channel and he gets away</v>

1590
01:10:06.501 --> 01:10:11.501
<v Speaker 4>with Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the reasons why it's got a </v>

1591
01:10:11.501 --> 01:10:11.501
<v Speaker 4>good chin as he hasn't taken a beating </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

1592
01:10:11.501 --> 01:10:12.680
<v Speaker 4>He's never taken a beating his entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>career.</v>

1593
01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:17.930
<v Speaker 4>You know Bernard Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he kept a skills pass any of the </v>

1594
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:19.640
<v Speaker 4>fighters of his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think about his fight with Roy Jones,</v>

1595
01:10:19.641 --> 01:10:21.650
<v Speaker 4>Jr Acumen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roy Jones Jr.</v>

1596
01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:25.910
<v Speaker 4>They duked it out once and roy beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when they do to the second time,</v>

1597
01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:31.090
<v Speaker 4>bernard hopkins basically just like box </v>
<v Speaker 4>box box them up because bernard's skills</v>

1598
01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:37.840
<v Speaker 4>hadn't deteriorated like roy's reflexes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like roy's skills were so reflex based.</v>

1599
01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:42.770
<v Speaker 4>He was so speed and reflex based,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion.</v>

1600
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:46.970
<v Speaker 4>He was The scariest boxer that you would</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever have to compete against.</v>

1601
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:49.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike Tyson was ferocious and terrifying,</v>

1602
01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:51.380
<v Speaker 4>so I shouldn't say he was man.</v>

1603
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:53.330
<v Speaker 4>It was close cbc,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously.</v>

1604
01:10:53.331 --> 01:10:58.331
<v Speaker 4>I was actually a line in an a nas song.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is welcome to the new world.</v>

1605
01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:02.030
<v Speaker 4>The new mike tyson's Roy Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was [inaudible].</v>

1606
01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:04.940
<v Speaker 4>Roy jones was just knocking everyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>silly.</v>

1607
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:06.800
<v Speaker 4>He didn't do it the same way that tyson </v>
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>

1608
01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:12.160
<v Speaker 4>He did it with just like speed and </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous combinations and insane </v>

1609
01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:17.021
<v Speaker 4>accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He could just move in a way that other </v>

1610
01:11:17.021 --> 01:11:19.911
<v Speaker 4>dudes couldn't move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you go back and watch his </v>

1611
01:11:19.911 --> 01:11:20.310
<v Speaker 4>highlight Reels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>god damn,</v>

1612
01:11:20.311 --> 01:11:24.240
<v Speaker 4>he was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he fought like this weird style with</v>

1613
01:11:24.241 --> 01:11:27.300
<v Speaker 4>your hands down and he didn't throw a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of jabs.</v>

1614
01:11:27.301 --> 01:11:30.360
<v Speaker 4>He threw like a leaping left hook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was so fast with it.</v>

1615
01:11:30.361 --> 01:11:33.150
<v Speaker 4>He would just catch guys on a chin and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he would light them up with it.</v>

1616
01:11:33.151 --> 01:11:34.890
<v Speaker 4>He threw a lot of lead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right hands.</v>

1617
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:40.040
<v Speaker 4>He had like a different style and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>style was based on his ability to cover </v>

1618
01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:40.440
<v Speaker 4>ground and his accuracy.</v>

1619
01:11:40.770 --> 01:11:45.770
<v Speaker 4>And as soon as they started getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>older and starting getting hit and </v>

1620
01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:48.471
<v Speaker 4>slowed down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that style was like and now actually a </v>

1621
01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:50.160
<v Speaker 4>detriment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he stopped being offensive.</v>

1622
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:54.330
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the most disheartening </v>
<v Speaker 4>things about watching Roy Jones jr fight</v>

1623
01:11:54.331 --> 01:11:56.850
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that he's still fighting,</v>

1624
01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:00.060
<v Speaker 4>is that he's not hurting anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like can you watch him fight?</v>

1625
01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:00.720
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's.</v>

1626
01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:04.410
<v Speaker 4>He has to be much more defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's been knocked out a few times now.</v>

1627
01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:08.460
<v Speaker 4>So now it's like his boxing is almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>like he's boxing,</v>

1628
01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:11.400
<v Speaker 4>she's trying to win,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's also trying to knock it knocked</v>

1629
01:12:11.401 --> 01:12:12.480
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How old is he though?</v>

1630
01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.800
<v Speaker 4>I believe he's 40 of does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He owes money.</v>

1631
01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:17.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wants to get an mma,</v>

1632
01:12:17.730 --> 01:12:22.730
<v Speaker 4>that's what the word is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was an article about some tax </v>

1633
01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:23.310
<v Speaker 4>issues and some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1634
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:27.270
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine that he thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some good money for them and mma</v>

1635
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:31.410
<v Speaker 4>and even at his age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the fights that he's Been in and the</v>

1636
01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:36.440
<v Speaker 4>toll that that takes on your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his boxing skills are so far and above </v>

1637
01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.150
<v Speaker 4>tHe average mma fighter that it would be</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of interesting.</v>

1638
01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.150
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you give a guy like Roy </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jones jr,</v>

1639
01:12:42.151 --> 01:12:47.151
<v Speaker 4>little tiny gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think how fast he has his regular </v>

1640
01:12:47.151 --> 01:12:47.151
<v Speaker 4>gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1641
01:12:47.151 --> 01:12:51.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean imagine give manny pacquiao,</v>
<v Speaker 4>little mma gloves and imagine how quick </v>

1642
01:12:52.511 --> 01:12:55.320
<v Speaker 4>he's punching you in the face and could </v>
<v Speaker 4>you even see it coming?</v>

1643
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:57.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you stop that?</v>

1644
01:12:57.370 --> 01:13:01.260
<v Speaker 4>It was like four ounces on them as </v>
<v Speaker 4>opposed to the,</v>

1645
01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:04.230
<v Speaker 4>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six or eight he's wearing regular basis.</v>

1646
01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:09.410
<v Speaker 4>That's a big difference man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those little tiny knuckle gloves as a </v>

1647
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:10.800
<v Speaker 4>big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If a guy like manny pacquiao got an mma,</v>

1648
01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.200
<v Speaker 4>teach them how to teach them some </v>
<v Speaker 4>butterfly guard,</v>

1649
01:13:16.201 --> 01:13:18.360
<v Speaker 4>how sprawl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to get back to your feet.</v>

1650
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:22.830
<v Speaker 4>It's work with them on that for a couple</v>
<v Speaker 4>of years and set them loose.</v>

1651
01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:25.500
<v Speaker 4>Is many though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good question.</v>

1652
01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.280
<v Speaker 4>He's in his thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1653
01:13:27.850 --> 01:13:29.220
<v Speaker 4>Go do six.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Manny pacquiao.</v>

1654
01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.620
<v Speaker 2>How old is manolo packy owl?</v>

1655
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:34.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't be a dick.</v>

1656
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you like me to search the web for </v>

1657
01:13:40.930 --> 01:13:41.510
<v Speaker 2>searching the web for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old is he?</v>

1658
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:44.970
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

1659
01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:48.570
<v Speaker 2>He was born December 17th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's 34,</v>

1660
01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.580
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1661
01:13:50.581 --> 01:13:51.510
<v Speaker 4>he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1662
01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:53.310
<v Speaker 4>he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not in the world of boxing.</v>

1663
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:55.800
<v Speaker 4>The world of boxing is a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1664
01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.220
<v Speaker 4>There's only a few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bernard hopkins is a matter of fact.</v>

1665
01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.900
<v Speaker 4>He's the only one that I can even think </v>
<v Speaker 4>of.</v>

1666
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:06.110
<v Speaker 4>There's no one else that's managed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>keep their career going that deep into </v>

1667
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:09.291
<v Speaker 4>their forties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one in the world of boxing dirty for </v>

1668
01:14:09.291 --> 01:14:10.020
<v Speaker 4>saying is he hasn't taken a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1669
01:14:10.050 --> 01:14:15.050
<v Speaker 4>he has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's been in some wars and that last </v>

1670
01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:15.970
<v Speaker 4>knockout,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that one walmart has knocked out.</v>

1671
01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:19.840
<v Speaker 4>That's a career changer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a career change because he ran into</v>

1672
01:14:19.841 --> 01:14:23.530
<v Speaker 4>a telephone pole right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean literally ran into it,</v>

1673
01:14:23.650 --> 01:14:28.650
<v Speaker 4>so it was him moving forward really fast</v>
<v Speaker 4>and mark has catching them on the button</v>

1674
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:31.510
<v Speaker 4>and they had two wars before that where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they dropped each other.</v>

1675
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:36.750
<v Speaker 4>So those guys have had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's gone through those fights and then </v>

1676
01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:37.390
<v Speaker 4>the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he lost his bradley.</v>

1677
01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.880
<v Speaker 4>There wasn't a war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was a tough fight,</v>

1678
01:14:40.150 --> 01:14:45.150
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you go like back to like some of </v>

1679
01:14:45.150 --> 01:14:45.150
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1680
01:14:45.150 --> 01:14:46.150
<v Speaker 4>his fights before then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1681
01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:47.800
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd been in some crazy fights.</v>

1682
01:14:47.801 --> 01:14:50.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though he still winning and looking</v>

1683
01:14:50.261 --> 01:14:51.530
<v Speaker 4>spectacular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1684
01:14:51.531 --> 01:14:55.150
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some wild exchanges ready for.</v>

1685
01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:59.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1686
01:14:59.170 --> 01:15:04.170
<v Speaker 4>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there was also like rampant </v>

1687
01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:04.570
<v Speaker 4>speculation of performance enhancing </v>
<v Speaker 4>substances.</v>

1688
01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:07.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1689
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:09.520
<v Speaker 4>And then there's always the question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they,</v>

1690
01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.230
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when fighters do those things,</v>

1691
01:15:11.231 --> 01:15:12.440
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1692
01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:16.270
<v Speaker 4>I think going to continue to do them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how are they going to like regulate it?</v>

1693
01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:17.530
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do they.</v>

1694
01:15:17.531 --> 01:15:21.370
<v Speaker 4>Like when you hit really high peaks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like performance enhancing drug peaks,</v>

1695
01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:24.820
<v Speaker 4>the real issue is if they are doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>something illegal,</v>

1696
01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:29.050
<v Speaker 4>how are they going to maintain that </v>
<v Speaker 4>level and will they maintain that level?</v>

1697
01:15:29.050 --> 01:15:32.470
<v Speaker 4>It's an artificial level so it's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to go ups and downs,</v>

1698
01:15:32.471 --> 01:15:37.471
<v Speaker 4>you've got to take time off in between </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it and you gotta make sure you </v>

1699
01:15:37.471 --> 01:15:38.500
<v Speaker 4>catch it right and sometimes they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>and when they don't,</v>

1700
01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:43.501
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll see like real ins consistencies </v>

1701
01:15:43.501 --> 01:15:43.501
<v Speaker 4>and their performance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see them when they looked absolutely</v>

1702
01:15:43.501 --> 01:15:48.211
<v Speaker 4>sensational and then you see them when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're in this like little spot in </v>

1703
01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:49.780
<v Speaker 4>between cycles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's not doing drugs?</v>

1704
01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.850
<v Speaker 4>Can you please tell me it's a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>

1705
01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.590
<v Speaker 4>Who's not doing drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good question.</v>

1706
01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:55.240
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of fighters aren't doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs.</v>

1707
01:15:55.241 --> 01:15:57.400
<v Speaker 4>I know bj penn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't say I know,</v>

1708
01:15:57.430 --> 01:16:02.430
<v Speaker 4>but I'm pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't think he would lie about </v>

1709
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:04.981
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's part of his whole honor with the </v>

1710
01:16:04.981 --> 01:16:05.430
<v Speaker 4>whole fight game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And john fitch I think is another one.</v>

1711
01:16:05.431 --> 01:16:06.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't think john fitch has ever done </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

1712
01:16:06.850 --> 01:16:11.850
<v Speaker 4>I personally talked to them about it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said he would never be able to live </v>

1713
01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:13.030
<v Speaker 4>with himself if you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knew that he got there because he was</v>

1714
01:16:13.031 --> 01:16:18.031
<v Speaker 4>doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was using something that dude got </v>

1715
01:16:18.031 --> 01:16:21.570
<v Speaker 4>really far with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like fucking grittiness and </v>

1716
01:16:21.570 --> 01:16:22.060
<v Speaker 4>toughness and will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1717
01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:25.930
<v Speaker 4>without any enhancement to his body </v>
<v Speaker 4>artificial.</v>

1718
01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:28.180
<v Speaker 4>But there's a lot of folks out there </v>
<v Speaker 4>that do do it.</v>

1719
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:34.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many you wouldn't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you're there with them is all </v>

1720
01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:35.170
<v Speaker 4>speculation because some guys just have </v>
<v Speaker 4>sensational genetics.</v>

1721
01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:39.040
<v Speaker 4>Some guys are just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just unbelievably robust and the</v>

<v Speaker 4>because like not everybody is born.</v>

1725
01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:51.070
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody says it's an even playing</v>

<v Speaker 4>and there's nothing you can do by the </v>

1735
01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.891
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can take all the steroids in the </v>

<v Speaker 4>frame and his athleticism,</v>

01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:20.830
<v Speaker 4>the average guy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Every actor over 50 right now in </v>
<v Speaker 3>hollywood shooting fucking shit.</v>

1741
01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:25.690
<v Speaker 3>Musicians on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>toward doing the 60 and 70.</v>

1742
01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:29.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the guys I think used the cream.</v>

1743
01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:29.720
<v Speaker 4>They use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1744
01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:30.520
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see those,</v>

1745
01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:33.890

<v Speaker 4>testosterone cream a little bit.</v>

1746
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:39.130
<v Speaker 4>This is going to be huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a spray or an oral spray because</v>

1747
01:17:39.411 --> 01:17:40.550
<v Speaker 4>it good.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's going to be the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1749
01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:47.291
<v Speaker 4>Apparently the absorption rate is even </v>
<v Speaker 4>better than I'm rubbing it on your skin.</v>

1750
01:17:48.171 --> 01:17:53.171
<v Speaker 4>The transdermal method,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's better when you put it in your </v>

1751
01:17:53.171 --> 01:17:55.421
<v Speaker 4>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He spray like you give yourself a shot </v>

1752
01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:55.421
<v Speaker 4>in the morning with cliq.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1753
01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:57.800
<v Speaker 4>you're a mouthwash,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do your mouthwash and then give yourself</v>

1754
01:17:57.801 --> 01:18:01.030
<v Speaker 4>a shot of testosterone and you're off on</v>
<v Speaker 4>your way to a cream.</v>

1755
01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:06.060
<v Speaker 4>You have to rub all over your whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire body or you rub it on your upper </v>

1756
01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:07.100
<v Speaker 4>arms and shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if you just more your not with it.</v>

1757
01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:09.710
<v Speaker 4>You could masturbate with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess to help anything maybe,</v>

1758
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:14.990
<v Speaker 4>but what if you cleaned up and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>accidentally cleaned up your test cream </v>

1759
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.950
<v Speaker 4>because you thought it was just you </v>
<v Speaker 4>would waste some of your tests.</v>

1760
01:18:15.951 --> 01:18:17.770
<v Speaker 4>Cream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been last year at dirty bastard.</v>

1761
01:18:17.771 --> 01:18:22.771
<v Speaker 4>He's just not all of yourself and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>pull your underwear over it and let it </v>

1762
01:18:22.771 --> 01:18:24.560
<v Speaker 4>all cook liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All stu inside your your ball sack area.</v>

1763
01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:28.700
<v Speaker 4>I've been masturbating with monistat </v>
<v Speaker 4>once a week now because it keeps your pe</v>

1764
01:18:28.710 --> 01:18:32.060
<v Speaker 4>or levels down your levels of what aid.</v>

1765
01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.910
<v Speaker 2>What is monistat first of all is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>some women use for yeast infections?</v>

1766
01:18:38.911 --> 01:18:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1767
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:44.550
<v Speaker 2>What is wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I found out that you can have </v>

1768
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:46.950
<v Speaker 2>guys have yeast infections and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>why if you have sex with a girl and she </v>

1769
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:50.401
<v Speaker 2>has a yeast infection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times you gave it to her </v>

1770
01:18:50.401 --> 01:18:50.710
<v Speaker 2>because you have don't have usually any </v>
<v Speaker 2>symptoms.</v>

1771
01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:55.800
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things to get rid of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is put monistat on your dick and around </v>

1772
01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.880
<v Speaker 2>your balls and around that shit at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>once a month,</v>

1773
01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:59.770
<v Speaker 2>but he's like every 20 minutes.</v>

1774
01:19:00.810 --> 01:19:05.810
<v Speaker 3>Here's the weirdest joe rogan 94.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was an open my comment that was </v>

1775
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:10.101
<v Speaker 3>getting divorced and I moved to New York</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would work in the city and that </v>

1776
01:19:10.101 --> 01:19:10.101
<v Speaker 3>was on the coke and I had this in child </v>
<v Speaker 3>support.</v>

1777
01:19:10.101 --> 01:19:14.871
<v Speaker 3>I just couldn't make it all work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So part of my angle every morning I get </v>

1778
01:19:14.871 --> 01:19:15.150
<v Speaker 3>a suit Before I went to work in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>city,</v>

1779
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:20.510
<v Speaker 3>I go to fort lee amp right there by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>George Washington bridge and they just </v>

1780
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:22.650
<v Speaker 3>finished stocking the shelves and I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>a briefcase like a bookcase.</v>

1781
01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:27.660
<v Speaker 3>I was a businessman in the city and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>put monistat now in the cases and a </v>

1782
01:19:28.650 --> 01:19:30.720
<v Speaker 3>monistat and there was something else </v>
<v Speaker 3>they liked,</v>

1783
01:19:30.730 --> 01:19:35.730
<v Speaker 3>like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not the little aspects but the big </v>

1784
01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:37.821
<v Speaker 3>aspirins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like walk over the George Washington </v>

1785
01:19:37.821 --> 01:19:40.761
<v Speaker 3>bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take them to a bodega and that's all </v>

1786
01:19:40.761 --> 01:19:40.800
<v Speaker 3>they would buy from you is yeast </v>
<v Speaker 3>infection medication.</v>

1787
01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:43.440
<v Speaker 3>That's what they tell you when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought them.</v>

1788
01:19:43.441 --> 01:19:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep bringing it.</v>

1789
01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:45.810
<v Speaker 3>That's the most of them.</v>

1790
01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:50.840
<v Speaker 2>One thing up in spanish harlem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I would walk over the bridge.</v>

1791
01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:52.520
<v Speaker 2>I got like 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 yeaRs.</v>

1792
01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Any books</v>

1793
01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.020
<v Speaker 4>in those days?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was an open mic.</v>

1794
01:19:54.021 --> 01:19:59.021
<v Speaker 4>I didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just going over there just enough </v>

1795
01:19:59.021 --> 01:19:59.120
<v Speaker 4>to have money to get a hot dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bag of weed and do whatever.</v>

1796
01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.400
<v Speaker 4>That's how crazy they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guys would say,</v>

1797
01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:04.360
<v Speaker 4>make sure it's the monistat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bring the monistat seven.</v>

1798
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.010
<v Speaker 4>It says an amazing how much people </v>
<v Speaker 4>identify with their.</v>

1799
01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 4>Because</v>

1800
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:13.160
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing that women hate more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than not want more than anything is </v>

1801
01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:17.421
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a massive generalization </v>

1802
01:20:17.421 --> 01:20:19.431
<v Speaker 3>that has taught myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's one thing that a lot of </v>

1803
01:20:19.431 --> 01:20:21.000
<v Speaker 3>women really do not appreciate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's stinky pussy jokes.</v>

1804
01:20:22.570 --> 01:20:24.900
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could talk about your stinky feet,</v>

1805
01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:30.140
<v Speaker 3>who can talk about a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stinky feet and talk about a girl's </v>

1806
01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:30.140
<v Speaker 3>breath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can talk about our girls,</v>

1807
01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:34.470
<v Speaker 3>but you can't talk about a girl stinky </v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy to them.</v>

1808
01:20:34.471 --> 01:20:39.471
<v Speaker 3>You can lose a lot of people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you talk about even onstage </v>

1809
01:20:39.471 --> 01:20:39.471
<v Speaker 3>really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1810

<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1811
01:20:39.471 --> 01:20:42.210
<v Speaker 3>I've seen someone do a stinky pussy joke</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I've seen women in the audience</v>

1812
01:20:42.211 --> 01:20:43.080
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know Bruce Lee,</v>

1831
01:21:38.661 --> 01:21:43.661
<v Speaker 3>you know I was that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stopped and I took it out to call </v>

1832
01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:45.050
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could.</v>

1833
01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:49.110
<v Speaker 3>I was dancing with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could smell my hand and that was it.</v>

1834
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:53.730
<v Speaker 3>I remember just fucking go do some sad </v>
<v Speaker 3>moments and you can't get it off.</v>

1835
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:57.720
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that the smell of fish is </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually from old come usually.</v>

1836
01:21:57.721 --> 01:22:00.020
<v Speaker 3>So if it's a really strong a fish </v>
<v Speaker 3>smelled,</v>

1837
01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:05.030
<v Speaker 3>that means there's common inside of her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's funny because that's what my is </v>

1838
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.820
<v Speaker 3>always smelled like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I jerk off and don't wipe up,</v>

1839
01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:11.010
<v Speaker 3>smells like fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't realize I'm bethesda.</v>

1840
01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:16.040
<v Speaker 3>I used to take up my own jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shoot sheet and my pubes and pull my </v>

1841
01:22:16.501 --> 01:22:16.860
<v Speaker 3>underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1842
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:21.870
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done that dozens of times in my </v>

1843
01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:21.870
<v Speaker 3>life to just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once I shoot of,</v>

1844
01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:24.120
<v Speaker 3>I jerk off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just shoot a load on my pubes.</v>

1845
01:22:24.121 --> 01:22:26.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't even bother cleaning it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just pull my underwear up.</v>

1846
01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.870
<v Speaker 3>I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially when I'm in the house.</v>

1847
01:22:27.871 --> 01:22:28.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as it's covered,</v>

1848
01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:29.610
<v Speaker 3>what do I give a fuck?</v>

1849
01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:33.810
<v Speaker 3>If I'm in the hotel room by myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get cares who cares.</v>

1850
01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:37.450
<v Speaker 3>Bandwidth on the bed and laid on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck all day.</v>

1851
01:22:37.451 --> 01:22:38.190
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1852
01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:43.410
<v Speaker 3>this is my little tropical helmet juice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was the only time I really ever</v>

1853
01:22:43.411 --> 01:22:48.411
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dated a chick that one before I </v>

1854
01:22:48.411 --> 01:22:48.411
<v Speaker 3>started dating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The chick was a little proof just when I</v>

1855
01:22:48.411 --> 01:22:48.810
<v Speaker 3>was like 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>

1856
01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:51.750
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what to expect to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy smell.</v>

1857
01:22:51.751 --> 01:22:53.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She took care of it.</v>

1858
01:22:53.331 --> 01:22:54.380
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1859
01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:57.240
<v Speaker 3>that you took care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was good.</v>

1860
01:22:57.630 --> 01:23:00.480
<v Speaker 3>I wouLd sniff it and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never sniffed nothing.</v>

1861
01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:01.560
<v Speaker 3>It was delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1862
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:03.510
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew a giRl when I was young and had a</v>

1863
01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:05.360
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you say something to him?</v>

1864
01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did</v>

1865
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.480
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was too.</v>

1866
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:12.510
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was those back then when you </v>

1867
01:23:12.510 --> 01:23:15.121
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're in your teenage years and </v>

1868
01:23:15.121 --> 01:23:15.121
<v Speaker 4>you fooling around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what the hell you're doing.</v>

1869
01:23:15.121 --> 01:23:15.640
<v Speaker 4>The last thing I'd do is start bringing </v>
<v Speaker 4>things up.</v>

1870
01:23:15.670 --> 01:23:17.500
<v Speaker 4>Did you keep eating it though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh no.</v>

1871
01:23:17.501 --> 01:23:18.970
<v Speaker 4>There was none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1872
01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:21.010
<v Speaker 4>there's none of that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She didn't want you to do that.</v>

1873
01:23:21.011 --> 01:23:23.950
<v Speaker 4>She knew something was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was just like,</v>

1874
01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:27.150
<v Speaker 4>it was one of those things where I bet </v>
<v Speaker 4>she was catholic girl.</v>

1875
01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.900
<v Speaker 4>I better parents and talk to her about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1876
01:23:28.901 --> 01:23:33.901
<v Speaker 4>I bet she had no idea and I bet she </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought that's just what they smelled </v>

1877
01:23:33.901 --> 01:23:33.901
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1878
01:23:33.901 --> 01:23:34.390
<v Speaker 4>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was unfortunate.</v>

1879
01:23:34.450 --> 01:23:36.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she figured it out later though later in</v>

1880
01:23:36.851 --> 01:23:38.790
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like while you up and told you no,</v>

1881
01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:39.250
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1882
01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:41.450
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hooked up with her later when I was in</v>

1883
01:23:41.451 --> 01:23:44.620
<v Speaker 4>like in my twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like once and I was like,</v>

1884
01:23:44.621 --> 01:23:46.060
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all cleaned up now.</v>

1885
01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:52.680
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if it still is a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like longest running yeast infection </v>

1886
01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:53.500
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one ever talked to her.</v>

1887
01:23:53.501 --> 01:23:55.630
<v Speaker 4>It was just like always this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was never discussed.</v>

1888
01:23:56.450 --> 01:24:01.450
<v Speaker 4>Some have a pre judge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you judge a woman to go chick's </v>

1889
01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:01.450
<v Speaker 4>pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1890
01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:05.710
<v Speaker 4>Like sometimes I look at a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a guy with your pussy smell </v>

1891
01:24:05.710 --> 01:24:05.710
<v Speaker 4>fucking horrible,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Pete harassed most.</v>

1894
01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:11.020
<v Speaker 4>Seeing a girl that took a sloppy drunk </v>
<v Speaker 4>with dirty feet.</v>

1895
01:24:11.021 --> 01:24:12.430
<v Speaker 4>You got to imagine that something going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

1896
01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:17.480
<v Speaker 4>I always go by weight usually because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bigger girls have a worst smell </v>

1897
01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:18.550
<v Speaker 4>because they could be like trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>clean their pussy for like the last five</v>

01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:28.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean it didn't stop me from eating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was skinny.</v>

1902
01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:32.380
<v Speaker 4>She had to be like 90 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a pussy weighed 60.</v>

1903

<v Speaker 3>What's the brand locker room?</v>

2172

<v Speaker 3>the brand.</v>

2180
01:36:50.391 --> 01:36:52.310
<v Speaker 3>It's this drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what happened was,</v>

2181
01:36:52.311 --> 01:36:57.311
<v Speaker 3>what time of the miami improv had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a condo across the street from it,</v>

2182
01:36:57.321 --> 01:36:59.660
<v Speaker 3>the old miami and probably belong to one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the owners.</v>

2183
01:36:59.661 --> 01:37:01.580
<v Speaker 3>It was where he put his mistresses issue</v>
<v Speaker 3>this bit.</v>

2184
01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:05.840
<v Speaker 3>But I think he bought the club,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the club and I had the bed in the wall.</v>

2185
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:09.170
<v Speaker 3>I must've fucked 80 women that I used to</v>
<v Speaker 3>tie him up there.</v>

2186
01:37:09.171 --> 01:37:14.171
<v Speaker 3>I would tie them up and put coke rocks </v>
<v Speaker 3>in their pussy and shit and they will </v>

2187
01:37:14.171 --> 01:37:16.130
<v Speaker 3>all wake up tied up like jesus and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get that bed,</v>

2188
01:37:16.131 --> 01:37:17.410
<v Speaker 3>you can still see like eight rope.</v>

2189
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:20.590
<v Speaker 3>I always had to get new rope to tie him </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2190
01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:23.810
<v Speaker 3>But one time I wasn't there and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>called me like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>

2193
01:37:26.481 --> 01:37:28.070
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you have to condo two weeks ago.</v>

<v Speaker 3>because weber was there,</v>

2196
01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:32.510
<v Speaker 3>left a mess and they left a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>poppers.</v>

2197
01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:35.960
<v Speaker 3>The type of mother I snort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coke dog.</v>

2198
01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:38.390

<v Speaker 3>poppers.</v>

2199
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:41.810
<v Speaker 3>And it was a little thing like this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you opened it and had locker in it.</v>

2200
01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.450
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a locker room or something.</v>

2201
01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:46.070
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which sniff it.</v>

2202
01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.560
<v Speaker 3>And they get you high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 60 seconds.</v>

2203

<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck that shit supposed to give </v>
<v Speaker 3>you an instant brain average to give you</v>

2204
01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:54.950
<v Speaker 3>age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2205
01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was</v>

2206
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:59.700
<v Speaker 4>what duesberg was claiming that that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>a part of,</v>

2207
01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:00.420
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2208
01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:05.600
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't even that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the most controversial podcast </v>

2209
01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:06.870
<v Speaker 4>we ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The age podcast that we had.</v>

2210
01:38:06.871 --> 01:38:10.010
<v Speaker 4>This guy peter duesberg and duesberg is </v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

2211
01:38:10.410 --> 01:38:13.720
<v Speaker 4>he's a professor at the university of </v>
<v Speaker 4>California berkeley.</v>

2212
01:38:13.721 --> 01:38:17.130
<v Speaker 4>He's a biologist and he was the one that</v>
<v Speaker 4>said that hiv doesn't cause aids.</v>

2213
01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:20.190
<v Speaker 4>So we had this guy on and tried to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>them explain to us.</v>

2214
01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:22.220
<v Speaker 4>Of course we're idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we didn't,</v>

2215
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:24.480
<v Speaker 4>we don't know if what he's saying is </v>
<v Speaker 4>right or wrong.</v>

2216
01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:26.640
<v Speaker 4>He might be completely full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He might be making shit up.</v>

2217
01:38:26.641 --> 01:38:27.090
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

2218
01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:28.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brian and I have no idea.</v>

2219
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:29.720
<v Speaker 4>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2220
01:38:29.730 --> 01:38:33.210
<v Speaker 4>let me get matt stags to see if he can </v>
<v Speaker 4>get someone to debate them.</v>

2221
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:38.510
<v Speaker 4>Nobody would debate the dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody was telling me I was an </v>

2222
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.510
<v Speaker 4>asshole for having them on because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2223
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:40.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but are you sure that he's not right?</v>

2224
01:38:40.590 --> 01:38:42.840
<v Speaker 4>He's got damn biologist at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>university of California,</v>

2225
01:38:42.841 --> 01:38:47.841
<v Speaker 4>berkeley published biologist who has </v>
<v Speaker 4>read all this like peer reviewed </v>

2226
01:38:47.841 --> 01:38:48.510
<v Speaker 4>research on cancer that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>respects.</v>

2227
01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:52.200
<v Speaker 4>And he's saying crazy shit like hiv </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't cause aids.</v>

2228
01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:54.300
<v Speaker 4>The problem is I'm an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2229
01:38:54.301 --> 01:38:56.550
<v Speaker 4>So when I go online and I try to read </v>
<v Speaker 4>the arguments,</v>

2230
01:38:56.551 --> 01:39:01.551
<v Speaker 4>like whether or not it does or doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems to me that if more people are </v>

2231
01:39:01.551 --> 01:39:04.881
<v Speaker 4>saying it does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I would go with them because </v>

2232
01:39:04.881 --> 01:39:04.881
<v Speaker 4>they're scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2233
01:39:04.881 --> 01:39:07.730
<v Speaker 4>There's a few of these row guys like him</v>
<v Speaker 4>that say it's just they're taking aim on</v>

2234
01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:12.740
<v Speaker 4>nitrate and they taking crystal meth and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just crushing their immune </v>

2235
01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:15.831
<v Speaker 4>system and that's why these guys were </v>
<v Speaker 4>all getting sick and that it's not hiv </v>

2236
01:39:15.831 --> 01:39:15.831
<v Speaker 4>killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's partying,</v>

2237
01:39:15.831 --> 01:39:17.730
<v Speaker 4>it's killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then people say,</v>

2238
01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:20.310
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a homophobe for saying this.</v>

2239
01:39:20.311 --> 01:39:25.311
<v Speaker 4>And it's a terrible thing he's doing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an justin's and blood is on his </v>

2240
01:39:25.311 --> 01:39:29.571
<v Speaker 4>hands and people are still dying of aids</v>
<v Speaker 4>and hiv because they don't take care of </v>

2241
01:39:29.571 --> 01:39:29.571
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

2242
01:39:29.571 --> 01:39:30.730
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2243
01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:32.990
<v Speaker 4>Copper bottle looks like this is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>ironic.</v>

2244
01:39:33.570 --> 01:39:35.720
<v Speaker 4>If anybody hears this and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

2245
01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:37.380
<v Speaker 4>Well that's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I rent the horse.</v>

2246
01:39:37.381 --> 01:39:42.381
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can just buy them in the stores for </v>

2247
01:39:42.381 --> 01:39:42.381
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the use for?</v>

2248
01:39:42.381 --> 01:39:43.530
<v Speaker 4>What are you supposed to use it for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.</v>

2249
01:39:43.531 --> 01:39:45.990
<v Speaker 4>Wholesale gay poppers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's legal.</v>

2250
01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.900
<v Speaker 4>Hold on son.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And go back.</v>

2251
01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:51.870
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm dropping knowledge on homes today.</v>

2252
01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:54.300
<v Speaker 4>Don't promote these because these are </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably killing people.</v>

2253
01:39:54.810 --> 01:39:59.810
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if anybody knows anybody that's a </v>

2254
01:39:59.810 --> 01:39:59.810
<v Speaker 4>biologist who wants a date,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a date,</v>

2255
01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:04.680
<v Speaker 4>peter duesberg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>show them some aids.</v>

2256
01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:07.740
<v Speaker 4>No debate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My apologies.</v>

2257
01:40:07.741 --> 01:40:09.870
<v Speaker 4>Mr duisburg sir.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just a joke.</v>

2258
01:40:09.871 --> 01:40:11.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there was any other show,</v>

2259
01:40:11.571 --> 01:40:16.571
<v Speaker 4>I probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you probably really be mad at me right </v>

2260
01:40:16.571 --> 01:40:16.571
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But those jokes happen often.</v>

2261
01:40:16.571 --> 01:40:17.970
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted someone to debate them,</v>

2262
01:40:18.030 --> 01:40:21.120
<v Speaker 4>but nobody wanted to have any pieces to </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent or because.</v>

2263
01:40:21.150 --> 01:40:23.520
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like a holocaust denier.</v>

2264
01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:28.820
<v Speaker 4>Like if you debate a holocaust denier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you actually giving them some form of </v>

2265
01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:29.520
<v Speaker 4>credit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

2266
01:40:29.521 --> 01:40:34.521
<v Speaker 4>by even debating them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if they're like a legit </v>

2267
01:40:34.521 --> 01:40:34.521
<v Speaker 4>historian sits down with a holocaust </v>
<v Speaker 4>denier,</v>

2268
01:40:34.521 --> 01:40:39.321
<v Speaker 4>like it's such a preposterous idea that </v>
<v Speaker 4>even to be connected with it is somehow </v>

2269
01:40:39.321 --> 01:40:43.641
<v Speaker 4>another pro promoting it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's so distasteful that nobody </v>

2270
01:40:43.641 --> 01:40:44.690
<v Speaker 4>wants to talk to a holocaust denier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's uh,</v>

2271
01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:45.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2272
01:40:45.271 --> 01:40:47.880
<v Speaker 4>you don't even give them the time of day</v>
<v Speaker 4>holocaust denier.</v>

2273
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.520
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A deny or someone who says the holocaust</v>

2274
01:40:50.521 --> 01:40:55.521
<v Speaker 4>didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people like that out </v>

2275
01:40:55.521 --> 01:40:55.521
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way.</v>

2276
01:40:55.521 --> 01:40:55.521
<v Speaker 4>There's</v>

2277
01:40:55.521 --> 01:40:57.300
<v Speaker 1>a lot of crazy fucks that think that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camps,</v>

2278
01:40:57.310 --> 01:41:00.010
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm going to get some tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what would you need to know?</v>

2279
01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Is it the exaggerated numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I need to know is why are you </v>

2280
01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:09.631
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you even trying to doubt that </v>

2281
01:41:09.631 --> 01:41:10.100
<v Speaker 1>aspect of history?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2282
01:41:10.170 --> 01:41:15.170
<v Speaker 1>have you ever watched those videos where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see those poor fucking people being </v>

2297
01:42:00.271 --> 01:42:04.560
<v Speaker 1>million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now when I think back of 30 years </v>

2430
01:48:01.791 --> 01:48:02.790
<v Speaker 1>used him drinking whiskey vodka with two</v>
<v Speaker 1>midgets.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is the real Michael Jackson to </v>
<v Speaker 1>doves and a pair of underwear.</v>

<v Speaker 1>nose because it's one of the weirdest </v>
<v Speaker 1>things ever.</v>

2439
01:48:26.041 --> 01:48:31.041
<v Speaker 1>And I remember seeing that saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a strange exercise and culture </v>

2440
01:48:31.041 --> 01:48:33.180
<v Speaker 1>that we're seeing in Michael Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh god.</v>

2441
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:36.870
<v Speaker 1>It just pulled it up in a freak because </v>
<v Speaker 1>for every human being,</v>

<v Speaker 1>these are strange times.</v>

2444
01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:43.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a skin graft over his nose or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2445
01:48:43.051 --> 01:48:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's tape looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the poster from silence of</v>

2446
01:48:46.231 --> 01:48:48.210
<v Speaker 1>the lambs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a tape over his nose?</v>

2447
01:48:48.211 --> 01:48:50.400
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a bandage?</v>

2448
01:48:50.630 --> 01:48:55.630
<v Speaker 1>It looks just like skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell if that skin or some </v>

2449
01:48:55.630 --> 01:48:56.730
<v Speaker 1>kind of a whole face adhesive or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2450
01:48:56.731 --> 01:49:01.731
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember looking at that image and </v>

<v Speaker 1>the skeleton?</v>

2452

<v Speaker 1>what must the pressure be like when </v>

01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:35.480
<v Speaker 4>por portion of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His standup is still one of the fees on </v>

2628
01:56:41.031 --> 01:56:41.910
<v Speaker 4>at the laugh factory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How was that the laugh?</v>

2629
01:56:41.911 --> 01:56:43.740
<v Speaker 4>There was 30 people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2630
01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:44.760
<v Speaker 4>But it was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2631
01:56:44.761 --> 01:56:49.761
<v Speaker 4>I did 30 people on monday night and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking I want to put the ha and I seen </v>

2632
01:56:50.910 --> 01:56:53.790
<v Speaker 4>david for a little while in front of 12 </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and what damon wins.</v>

2633
01:56:53.791 --> 01:56:56.400
<v Speaker 4>He's making a comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's only going through 12 people,</v>

2634
01:56:56.580 --> 01:56:58.860
<v Speaker 4>12 people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He always liked doing that though.</v>

2635
01:56:58.890 --> 01:57:03.890
<v Speaker 4>He loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would show up at 1230 at night with </v>

2636
01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:08.370
<v Speaker 4>pain and somebody always a and he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I love about damon,</v>

2637
01:57:08.371 --> 01:57:13.371
<v Speaker 4>I used to love watching damon work shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>out because he'll like really work </v>

2638
01:57:13.371 --> 01:57:14.280
<v Speaker 4>something out a killer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have an idea on stage.</v>

2639
01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:16.830
<v Speaker 4>It's just Like a couple of words or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of,</v>

2640
01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:19.110
<v Speaker 4>not a couple of words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a couple of concepts,</v>

2641
01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:20.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he'll take them.</v>

2642
01:57:20.701 --> 01:57:24.030
<v Speaker 4>And just run with him and because he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>gotta make all these people laugh.</v>

2643
01:57:24.210 --> 01:57:27.990
<v Speaker 4>Like the pressure of that will lead him </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's a great writer.</v>

2644
01:57:27.991 --> 01:57:30.750
<v Speaker 4>Leads him to the best lines all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2645
01:57:30.751 --> 01:57:32.790
<v Speaker 4>I used to watch him work shit out on </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage.</v>

2646
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:38.030
<v Speaker 4>Like he would write right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he would also work shit out on </v>

2647
01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:39.690
<v Speaker 4>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas mooney did a lot of writing,</v>

2648
01:57:39.930 --> 01:57:43.290
<v Speaker 4>like moonee would come in there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>something would happen.</v>

2649
01:57:43.470 --> 01:57:48.470
<v Speaker 4>Like you remember the airplane crashed </v>
<v Speaker 4>Florida and crashed in the swamp and </v>

2650
01:57:48.691 --> 01:57:51.780
<v Speaker 4>mooney did a bit about old black ladies </v>
<v Speaker 4>still clutching their purse.</v>

2651
01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:54.270
<v Speaker 4>I remember that they pull them out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the crocodile.</v>

2652
01:57:54.271 --> 01:57:59.271
<v Speaker 4>They still clutching their purse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he had that like written like </v>

2653
01:57:59.271 --> 01:58:02.781
<v Speaker 4>within a couple of days of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the the plane crash and it was a </v>

2654
01:58:02.781 --> 01:58:03.300
<v Speaker 4>written bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2655
01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:03.740
<v Speaker 4>he did it.</v>

2656
01:58:04.050 --> 01:58:07.620
<v Speaker 4>so he would like capitalizing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You always have a lot of new shit but it</v>

2657
01:58:07.621 --> 01:58:12.621
<v Speaker 4>would be like a written bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas you could see damon was like </v>

2658
01:58:12.621 --> 01:58:16.011
<v Speaker 4>working it out while he was up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would have an idea and he would just </v>

2659
01:58:16.011 --> 01:58:17.160
<v Speaker 4>flush it out while I was up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when it would hit him,</v>

2660
01:58:17.310 --> 01:58:20.910
<v Speaker 4>like the punchline would hit him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would start crackinG up like not like</v>

2661
01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:24.000
<v Speaker 4>that fake cracking up shit that bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedians do.</v>

2662
01:58:24.001 --> 01:58:24.990
<v Speaker 4>It's gross,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2663
01:58:25.230 --> 01:58:27.570
<v Speaker 4>When you see people fake laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2664
01:58:27.571 --> 01:58:29.610
<v Speaker 4>big bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You laugh the exact same way every night</v>

2665
01:58:29.611 --> 01:58:31.270
<v Speaker 4>when you tell that joke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a fake laugh,</v>

2666
01:58:31.670 --> 01:58:32.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fake laugh.</v>

2667
01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:38.320
<v Speaker 4>It's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But damon would like every now and then </v>

2668
01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:38.550
<v Speaker 4>he really make himself laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2669
01:58:38.551 --> 01:58:41.740
<v Speaker 4>I've watched him do those late night </v>
<v Speaker 4>sets of the store bunch of times.</v>

2670
01:58:41.741 --> 01:58:42.100
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's</v>

2671

<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your member,</v>

2744
02:01:47.531 --> 02:01:49.280
<v Speaker 4>bags.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had these plastic bags,</v>

02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:53.990
<v Speaker 4>the stuff inside of his clothes keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>them warm because he would walk home and</v>

2746
02:01:53.991 --> 02:01:55.820
<v Speaker 4>he'd be in downtown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he didn't.</v>

2747
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:58.910
<v Speaker 4>He'd walked downtown like when he would </v>
<v Speaker 4>leave the comedy store,</v>

2748
02:01:58.911 --> 02:02:01.970

<v Speaker 2>the end.</v>

2852
02:06:25.300 --> 02:06:27.520
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no hidden corners here.</v>

2853
02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:30.220
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel like a comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all with white booths.</v>

2854
02:06:30.370 --> 02:06:33.040
<v Speaker 2>Like where are we?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we in miami in 1998.</v>

2855
02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:35.890
<v Speaker 2>It feels like a hotel room or a hotel </v>
<v Speaker 2>bar.</v>

2856
02:06:36.050 --> 02:06:37.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels like a road gig.</v>

2857
02:06:37.580 --> 02:06:42.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels like a gig you would do if </v>

2858
02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:42.580
<v Speaker 4>you're in western Massachusetts where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they had like the bar.</v>

2859
02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:47.050
<v Speaker 4>The club still is great once you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>inside the actual setup is pretty </v>

2860
02:06:47.050 --> 02:06:47.510
<v Speaker 4>fucking perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2861
02:06:47.511 --> 02:06:49.400
<v Speaker 4>and the way they have it now with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bar over there,</v>

2862
02:06:49.401 --> 02:06:54.401
<v Speaker 4>it does have less noise because people </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to leave and go down that hall and </v>

2863
02:06:54.401 --> 02:06:58.631
<v Speaker 4>then take a right and then take a left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's probably like quieter for them </v>

2864
02:06:58.631 --> 02:06:59.420
<v Speaker 4>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just seems weird.</v>

2865
02:06:59.660 --> 02:07:02.570
<v Speaker 4>I guess that that annex though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't making any money,</v>

2866
02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:04.790
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also they got rid of the annex.</v>

2867
02:07:04.840 --> 02:07:06.200
<v Speaker 4>Annex doesn't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

2868
02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:08.520
<v Speaker 2>they were the bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're also renting out the,</v>

2869
02:07:08.521 --> 02:07:11.090
<v Speaker 2>the front part of it to a hamburger </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

2870
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:13.770
<v Speaker 2>So kind of hamburgers going to be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>umami.</v>

2871
02:07:13.830 --> 02:07:14.990
<v Speaker 2>It's actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2872
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:17.240
<v Speaker 2>nami burger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I've had those before.</v>

2873
02:07:17.890 --> 02:07:19.250
<v Speaker 2>The weirdest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weirdest.</v>

2874
02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:21.290
<v Speaker 2>The weirdest thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the murals I,</v>

2875
02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:22.610
<v Speaker 2>if you've ever been to the hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 2>improv,</v>

2876
02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:25.580
<v Speaker 2>we used to have like these big drawings </v>
<v Speaker 2>or paintings on over him.</v>

2877
02:07:25.610 --> 02:07:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're just this new mural that all</v>

2878
02:07:27.630 --> 02:07:28.880
<v Speaker 2>the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2879
02:07:28.881 --> 02:07:33.881
<v Speaker 2>and it's huge and it's just a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>comics and you sit there and you're </v>

2880
02:07:33.881 --> 02:07:35.590
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out who's who.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone does not look like who they are</v>

2881
02:07:35.591 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 2>and it looks</v>

2882
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:38.220
<v Speaker 1>really like a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How I,</v>

2883
02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:43.260
<v Speaker 1>the only picture I have is there's only </v>
<v Speaker 1>one microphone on this mural like and </v>

2884
02:07:43.260 --> 02:07:45.040
<v Speaker 1>there's only one person standing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of the microphone and this is like</v>

2885
02:07:45.041 --> 02:07:50.041
<v Speaker 1>a simulation theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that one thing is a fucking dolphin </v>

2886
02:07:50.041 --> 02:07:50.670
<v Speaker 1>for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for no reason at all.</v>

2887
02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:56.040
<v Speaker 1>A dolphin in front of the microphone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you could kind of see a couple of </v>

2888
02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:57.190
<v Speaker 1>comics here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't tell.</v>

2889
02:07:57.240 --> 02:07:58.980
<v Speaker 1>I know who that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the puppets.</v>

2890
02:07:59.030 --> 02:08:01.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the only photo of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only photo I have.</v>

2891
02:08:01.210 --> 02:08:03.730
<v Speaker 1>I can find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if I can find like only a partial of</v>

2892
02:08:03.731 --> 02:08:08.731
<v Speaker 1>the part of the euro dolphin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that it would have on </v>

2893
02:08:08.731 --> 02:08:12.040
<v Speaker 1>sunglasses too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno man.</v>

2894
02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:14.710
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no rhyme or reason.</v>

2895
02:08:14.890 --> 02:08:17.500
<v Speaker 1>there's no logic to why they would take </v>
<v Speaker 1>down those other paintings.</v>

2896
02:08:17.501 --> 02:08:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Those pins were old as fuck.</v>

2897
02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:21.220
<v Speaker 1>There was like a part of history I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2898
02:08:21.490 --> 02:08:22.540
<v Speaker 1>I think here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2899
02:08:23.050 --> 02:08:25.210

<v Speaker 3>screen.</v>

2950
02:10:45.530 --> 02:10:48.390
<v Speaker 3>That's why they put the creativity and </v>

<v Speaker 3>the garden.</v>

2957

<v Speaker 3>He felt like it was just too big.</v>

2964
02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:22.390
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like $1,800</v>

2965
02:11:22.391 --> 02:11:24.890
<v Speaker 3>or something after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all downhill after that.</v>

2966
02:11:25.130 --> 02:11:30.130
<v Speaker 3>For a guy that rants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's downhill for a guy who's very </v>

2967
02:11:30.130 --> 02:11:30.380
<v Speaker 3>slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we seen the guy in jersey,</v>

2968
02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:32.000
<v Speaker 3>a slow pace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

2969
02:11:32.300 --> 02:11:36.900
<v Speaker 3>but a guy who steps on his own lines and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't like it.</v>

2970
02:11:36.930 --> 02:11:41.930
<v Speaker 3>It was absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the issue when people laugh and </v>

2971
02:11:41.930 --> 02:11:42.830
<v Speaker 3>you can't hear what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like 1800 or above.</v>

2972
02:11:43.330 --> 02:11:44.790
<v Speaker 3>You don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nice money.</v>

2973
02:11:44.791 --> 02:11:45.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a good time,</v>

2974
02:11:45.741 --> 02:11:47.860
<v Speaker 3>but I don't feel good when I walk off </v>
<v Speaker 3>the set.</v>

2975
02:11:47.861 --> 02:11:51.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like I did nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just struggling to talk slow.</v>

2976
02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:53.590
<v Speaker 3>My patois jb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All my timing was off.</v>

2977
02:11:54.270 --> 02:11:55.280
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked it.</v>

2978
02:11:55.281 --> 02:12:00.281
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where I want to shoot a </v>

2979
02:12:00.281 --> 02:12:02.021
<v Speaker 3>special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to shoot it at somewhere where </v>

2980
02:12:02.021 --> 02:12:02.021
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do theaters.</v>

2981
02:12:02.021 --> 02:12:03.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't want people to come see me in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking.</v>

2982
02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:04.710
<v Speaker 3>They ended up punching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I honestly,</v>

2983
02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:06.150
<v Speaker 3>atlanta punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a great idea.</v>

2984
02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:11.700
<v Speaker 3>That's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I honestly think 300 is the threshold </v>

2985
02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:14.130
<v Speaker 3>for things getting different to 72,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>

2986
02:12:14.131 --> 02:12:14.650
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>

2987
02:12:14.830 --> 02:12:16.420
<v Speaker 3>9:50</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets a little kinky,</v>

2988
02:12:17.220 --> 02:12:20.130
<v Speaker 3>put even carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tremendous.</v>

2989
02:12:20.350 --> 02:12:21.890
<v Speaker 3>It's big though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too bad.</v>

2990
02:12:21.950 --> 02:12:26.950
<v Speaker 3>Carbs is tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you have the Little thing </v>

2991
02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:26.950
<v Speaker 3>on top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a little fucked up too.</v>

2992
02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:31.840
<v Speaker 3>On top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the back it goes way back and above </v>

2993
02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:35.080
<v Speaker 3>this we don't sell much of a connection </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a perfect place to take this perfect </v>

2994
02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:35.080
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

2995
02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:37.040
<v Speaker 3>American comedy co because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad either,</v>

2996
02:12:37.250 --> 02:12:38.710

<v Speaker 3>spot.</v>

2997
02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:41.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to shoot in California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Do we want to go somewhere to light up a</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3005
02:13:04.551 --> 02:13:09.551
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I want to go somewhere when you do a </v>

3006
02:13:09.551 --> 02:13:09.551
<v Speaker 3>set in la,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fun,</v>

3007
02:13:09.551 --> 02:13:10.540
<v Speaker 3>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they could see us anytime.</v>

3008
02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:13.800
<v Speaker 3>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was ruling ck,</v>

3009
02:13:13.950 --> 02:13:16.850
<v Speaker 3>you jump up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was fucking,</v>

3010
02:13:16.851 --> 02:13:18.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Hart,</v>

3011
02:13:18.231 --> 02:13:19.970
<v Speaker 3>I do fucking whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stand up,</v>

3012
02:13:19.971 --> 02:13:21.260
<v Speaker 3>live downtown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3013
02:13:21.261 --> 02:13:23.960
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not and I never got to.</v>

3014
02:13:24.110 --> 02:13:27.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do that kind of standup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Rather put smaller.</v>

3015
02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:30.700
<v Speaker 3>That's why I do good when I got on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rant and shit in a big theater.</v>

3016
02:13:30.701 --> 02:13:32.250
<v Speaker 3>I it what's also,</v>

3017
02:13:32.250 --> 02:13:34.800
<v Speaker 4>it's a matter of how much money do you </v>
<v Speaker 4>really need?</v>

3018
02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:37.710
<v Speaker 4>Because if you start getting into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>eight and 10,000</v>

3019
02:13:37.711 --> 02:13:42.711
<v Speaker 4>seats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one thing if you're doing it </v>

3020
02:13:42.711 --> 02:13:42.711
<v Speaker 4>because the demand is really high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want anybody to not be able to</v>

3021
02:13:42.711 --> 02:13:44.970
<v Speaker 4>go because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the shows would be all sold out,</v>

3022
02:13:45.420 --> 02:13:48.000
<v Speaker 4>but you can make a lot of money Just </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing clubs.</v>

3023
02:13:48.030 --> 02:13:53.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much money does a comic need to </v>

3024
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.030
<v Speaker 4>exist in this life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3025
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:55.380
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're living like a normal person,</v>

3026
02:13:55.990 --> 02:13:58.560
<v Speaker 4>you can do clubs and you can make plenty</v>
<v Speaker 4>of money.</v>

3027
02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:02.250
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the show will be more like you,</v>

3028
02:14:02.430 --> 02:14:05.370
<v Speaker 4>like I can go see you in a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 4>seats.</v>

3029
02:14:05.371 --> 02:14:08.130
<v Speaker 4>You can be screaming and yelling at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>top of your lungs and ran.</v>

3030
02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:10.410
<v Speaker 4>I'll know every word that comes out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your mouth.</v>

3031
02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:11.700
<v Speaker 4>There'll be no questions.</v>

3032
02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:13.290
<v Speaker 4>What did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't hear.</v>

3033
02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:16.680
<v Speaker 4>There'd be none of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you get into those two and 3000</v>

3034
02:14:16.681 --> 02:14:21.681
<v Speaker 4>seat places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are a moment and I noticed that </v>

3035
02:14:21.681 --> 02:14:22.080
<v Speaker 4>when we watched that guy in jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a moment.</v>

3036
02:14:22.081 --> 02:14:27.081
<v Speaker 4>There was a few moments where I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know what he had said because he was </v>

3037
02:14:27.081 --> 02:14:27.450
<v Speaker 4>like ranting as they were laughing and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

3038
02:14:27.510 --> 02:14:29.130
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is interesting.</v>

3039
02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:34.160
<v Speaker 4>Very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dynamics were great for a 2,400</v>

3040
02:14:34.530 --> 02:14:36.690
<v Speaker 4>seat theater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The dynamIcs of chicago.</v>

3041
02:14:36.990 --> 02:14:38.070
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>tremendous.</v>

3042
02:14:38.071 --> 02:14:40.360
<v Speaker 4>I rented there and they came up </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfectly,</v>

3043
02:14:40.770 --> 02:14:45.300
<v Speaker 4>but that's a very few and far between </v>
<v Speaker 4>that that place is magical.</v>

3044
02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:48.750
<v Speaker 4>Magical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would also consider shooting a special</v>

3045
02:14:48.751 --> 02:14:51.090
<v Speaker 4>if it wasn't so big in the place we did </v>
<v Speaker 4>in pittsburgh.</v>

3046
02:14:51.690 --> 02:14:54.660
<v Speaker 4>That was a great place to theater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the carnegie library,</v>

<v Speaker 4>was no library.</v>

3049
02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:05.360
<v Speaker 4>There's so many places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I could find a good old fucking </v>

02:21:19.820 --> 02:21:21.950

<v Speaker 4>the people were so healthy there.</v>

3191
02:21:22.190 --> 02:21:24.360

<v Speaker 4>the air is clean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which it is,</v>

3193
02:21:25.641 --> 02:21:28.040

<v Speaker 4>mountains like enriches you.</v>

3194
02:21:28.670 --> 02:21:31.430

02:25:52.650 --> 02:25:55.840
<v Speaker 1>anywhere we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this strip club there was huge </v>

3305
02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:58.140
<v Speaker 1>because women come from all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle and early.</v>

3306
02:25:58.150 --> 02:26:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Two tHousands that there's a ratio of 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>to one men to women go up there and the </v>

3307
02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:08.550
<v Speaker 1>dav,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a seasoned efficiencies and they'd make </v>

3308
02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:08.840
<v Speaker 1>a fucking thousand shaking.</v>

3309
02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another season in late july and </v>

3310
02:26:14.340 --> 02:26:15.400
<v Speaker 1>the silver salmon are running like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3312
02:26:16.570 --> 02:26:18.130
<v Speaker 1>towards the end of the month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently.</v>

3313
02:26:18.131 --> 02:26:20.020
<v Speaker 1>That's another big time when people come</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

3314
02:26:20.410 --> 02:26:23.530
<v Speaker 1>And then it's also people would come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the various hunting seasons.</v>

3315
02:26:23.531 --> 02:26:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Like moose season starts in september.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People come up for that.</v>

3316
02:26:26.381 --> 02:26:30.820
<v Speaker 1>But god damn that places majestic.</v>

3317
02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:36.000
<v Speaker 1>you just see eagles everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw five moose were there for two </v>

3318
02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:36.000
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw five loose.</v>

3319
02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.000
<v Speaker 1>And there's just something about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

3320
02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:39.610
<v Speaker 1>It just makes you humble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3321
02:26:39.611 --> 02:26:41.620
<v Speaker 1>it makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it humbles you because it's just,</v>

3322
02:26:41.621 --> 02:26:43.870
<v Speaker 1>it's when you're flying over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look down,</v>

3323
02:26:43.871 --> 02:26:47.800
<v Speaker 1>your jaw just drops because it goes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>for ever.</v>

3324
02:26:47.801 --> 02:26:52.801
<v Speaker 1>And Then forever you see nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just see mountains and trees and </v>

3325
02:26:52.801 --> 02:26:54.070
<v Speaker 1>mountains and trees and mountains and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trees and mountains and trees.</v>

3326
02:26:54.220 --> 02:26:54.970
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3327
02:26:54.971 --> 02:26:57.430
<v Speaker 1>we're starting our descendant to aspen </v>

<v Speaker 1>anchorage.</v>
