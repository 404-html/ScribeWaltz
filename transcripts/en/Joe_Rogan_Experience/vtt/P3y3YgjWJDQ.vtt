<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just like you're saying about how bad the government is,</v>

6
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 2>how many bad things they've done,</v>

7
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

8
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.721
<v Speaker 2>in the past.</v>

9
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 2>But everyone never looks at the good shit,</v>

10
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.361
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

11
00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 2>And no one's ever looking at all the good shit they do.</v>

12
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to tell on the bad stuff.</v>

13
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's necessarily the Grand Canyon.</v>

14
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:19.291
<v Speaker 2>It's bad ass.</v>

23
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>We have to play because I really liked the song and it's a super appropriate and</v>

24
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>we'll just talk over it.</v>

25
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.601
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

26
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:34.640

<v Speaker 1>I want you to think it's important.</v>

34
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>It's really important.</v>

35
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 1>It's really important for two reasons.</v>

36
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>One because I honestly like this song.</v>

37
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I like the sound a lot.</v>

38
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.101
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

45
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>It's just so fascinating because it's a super,</v>

46
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>super patriotic song.</v>

47

<v Speaker 1>it's so patriotic.</v>

50
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:10.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like almost like a parody.</v>
