<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a woman who is into nice clothes</v>

2
00:00:05.301 --> 00:00:07.070
<v Speaker 1>and nice nails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3
00:00:07.071 --> 00:00:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say he's into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell by the type,</v>

4
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.300
<v Speaker 1>the type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is the type the guy should look</v>

5
00:00:11.301 --> 00:00:13.640
<v Speaker 1>out for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a like you are going to give a</v>

6
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>seminar how?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh should avoid nightmare horrible</v>

7
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:19.100
<v Speaker 1>women in their life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which should they avoid.</v>

8
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You okay?</v>

9
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

10
00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:23.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a case by case basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty different horrible</v>

11
00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:24.674
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

12
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.390
<v Speaker 1>if she's got big old French tip nails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a little bit of white trash.</v>

13
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friendship nails are bad.</v>

14
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Like long press on French tip nails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if they're real nails?</v>

15
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.190
<v Speaker 1>They're French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Touch tip is,</v>

16
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.960
<v Speaker 1>to me it's just such a trashy book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's fine.</v>

17
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

18
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about like dark red,</v>

19
00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:46.010
<v Speaker 1>like Spanish girl with red lipstick and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark red nails?</v>

20
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole package because you can</v>

21
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 1>have trashy elements like I'm wearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut off jeans right now in a see through</v>

22
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>tank top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

23
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.980
<v Speaker 1>But it's ready to judge you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the rest of me is not polished.</v>

24
00:00:56.981 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the rest I've got like</v>
<v Speaker 1>messy hair and one foot painted.</v>

25
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.500
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay because I'm like not trying.</v>

26
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just,</v>

27
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Speaker 1>there's just certain looks that women</v>
<v Speaker 1>have and I don't want to say,</v>

28
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this hairdo.</v>

29
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:11.480
<v Speaker 1>It's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole,</v>

30
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 1>and you know what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole myriad of elements that</v>

31
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:16.370
<v Speaker 1>come together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does she have,</v>

32
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.440
<v Speaker 1>and there's nothing wrong with having</v>
<v Speaker 1>like enhancements.</v>

33
00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Does she have fake lips and fake tits</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hair extensions and claws?</v>

34
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Andy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she weren't stripper heels.</v>

35
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Well then she's probably fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>

36
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Like let's get serious lucite heels like</v>
<v Speaker 1>indoors.</v>

37
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.510
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty rare though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

38
00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:33.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're with some pretty extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>examples.</v>

39
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what realm we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with.</v>

40
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.700
<v Speaker 1>The fake lip thing is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy one too.</v>

41
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Like they never really worked that out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in so many girls jumped on that</v>

42
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Speaker 1>bandwagon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me,</v>

43
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.140
<v Speaker 1>jumped on that bandwagon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fucked up their face forever.</v>

44
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.120
<v Speaker 1>I think women in Hollywood make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

45
00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:51.340
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would rather look super weird that</v>

46
00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:54.760
<v Speaker 1>look super old because when you like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of them you can't tell what they</v>

47
00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:55.810
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how old they are.</v>

48
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.980
<v Speaker 1>This is so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this woman that I see at my</v>

49
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.280
<v Speaker 1>daughter's school when I drop my kid off</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and cheese.</v>

50
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.620
<v Speaker 1>It makes me sad because this lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

51
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.390
<v Speaker 1>she looked like she was probably pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was younger and she's not that</v>

52
00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:10.780
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

53
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.620
<v Speaker 1>She's probably in her late thirties</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe early forties but she has turned</v>

54
00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:18.340
<v Speaker 1>her face into that a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a monster and there's no going back.</v>

55
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.050
<v Speaker 1>It's rubber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't move.</v>

56
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.230
<v Speaker 1>It's frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's filled in in weird ways where it</v>

57
00:02:23.231 --> 00:02:26.080
<v Speaker 1>looks like she's got a fucking tooth</v>
<v Speaker 1>ache or something like her face is</v>

58
00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:28.610
<v Speaker 1>swollen and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what the kicker is?</v>

59
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.030
<v Speaker 1>She might've gone in for one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a weird reaction or whatever and</v>

60
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:35.300
<v Speaker 1>like now it's like that and she might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a super cool lady or something and</v>

61
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:37.400
<v Speaker 1>that's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're stuck with,</v>

62
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>well you know what I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a dysmorphia.</v>

63
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the same thing where anorexics</v>

64
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>habit bodybuilders have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women who have a boob implants a lot of</v>

65
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>times never think their boob implants</v>
<v Speaker 1>are big enough.</v>

66
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.880
<v Speaker 1>They want to keep going and going and</v>
<v Speaker 1>going and getting bigger and bigger.</v>

67
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.530
<v Speaker 1>They get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get crazy,</v>

68
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.350
<v Speaker 1>they'll look at them and they're like</v>
<v Speaker 1>not big enough like they,</v>

69
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:56.750
<v Speaker 1>they don't see what everyone else is</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing.</v>

70
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>What we were talking about before about</v>
<v Speaker 1>mma,</v>

71
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>I think it's still in a learning period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we still haven't got it down the</v>

72
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say football has it down,</v>

73
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>they know exactly how to train to</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop like top flight football</v>

74
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 1>players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball,</v>

75
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to a basketball camp,</v>

76
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with top flight strength</v>
<v Speaker 1>and conditioning coach.</v>

77
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>They really know how to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there you're dealing with multi</v>

78
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>multimillion dollar athletes and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that investment and they want to</v>

79
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>keep it healthy and really no one should</v>
<v Speaker 1>apply that more than MMA fighters</v>

80
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 1>because who the fuck gets hurt more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>MMA fighters?</v>

81
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Whiteside and Woodside</v>

82
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.500
<v Speaker 2>probably is the worst taught sport in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

83
00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:33.050
<v Speaker 2>especially in Thailand because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>no history of teaching.</v>

84
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.860
<v Speaker 2>So it was like a is teaching fighters</v>
<v Speaker 2>would they just copied by osmosis</v>

85
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 2>pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

86
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.320
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the posts backwards sports</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

87
00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Everyone della Mae and isn't a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking and drinking as well.</v>

88
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 2>We had</v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

89
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.770
<v Speaker 2>like they've gotten a lot of um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

90
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.840
<v Speaker 2>fight against alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flight gets drugs.</v>

91
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.050
<v Speaker 2>This is a lot of promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you've got a lot of guys like</v>

92
00:03:54.051 --> 00:03:58.070
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Mallett pedal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's actually American,</v>

93
00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:02.090
<v Speaker 2>add [inaudible] and these guys are</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroes.</v>

95
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.070
<v Speaker 2>So for people there's a lot more push</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards the be healthy,</v>

96
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.660
<v Speaker 2>get fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could make good money.</v>

97
00:04:08.661 --> 00:04:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Now go to Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can fight in American dude dives.</v>

98
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>just sitting there smoking.</v>

117
00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:54.630
<v Speaker 1>So if I buy him a box of cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll let me film him kicking the bag.</v>

118
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.540
<v Speaker 1>So just bring a box of cigarettes and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked the bag for me.</v>

119
00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Show me the technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.430
<v Speaker 1>like they're just smoking and alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 1>over there is out of control.</v>

121
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

122
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Speaker 3>There at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being on the top of it in industry,</v>

123
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 3>especially in an industry that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in technology is a very</v>

124
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 3>precarious position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

125
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.810
<v Speaker 3>if you talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

126
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 3>Kodak a decade ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think they would,</v>

127
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.820
<v Speaker 3>they would realize that suddenly it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the largest vendor or manufacturer of</v>

128
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:27.760
<v Speaker 3>cameras in the world would be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>telephone company.</v>

129
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 3>Nokia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nokia,</v>

130
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:34.321
<v Speaker 3>within three years became the world's</v>
<v Speaker 3>largest maker of cameras and suddenly</v>

131
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 3>the entire industry changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

132
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 3>And how do you compete against that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not even in your industry.</v>

133
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 3>They just came out of left field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're suddenly the horse</v>

134
00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:47.350
<v Speaker 3>buggy manufacturer and Ford is taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>your business and you never expected</v>

135
00:05:47.351 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 3>that was going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well Nokia has a,</v>

136
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.590
<v Speaker 3>has a</v>

137
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.480
<v Speaker 1>camera phone now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a windows phone that is some insane</v>

138
00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>amount of pixels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 40 fucking megapixels or</v>

139
00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some crazy 41 41 megapixel says Jamie.</v>

140
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Jamie is on top of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>41 fucking megapixels on a phone.</v>

141
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean this thing I think has of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>note three,</v>

142
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:11.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it has 12 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

143
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>it's better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you familiar with Moore's law?</v>

144
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.600
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

145
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.880
<v Speaker 3>so for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your listeners to Moore's law,</v>

146
00:06:17.881 --> 00:06:20.520
<v Speaker 3>it was created by Gordon Moore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pro processors,</v>

147
00:06:20.521 --> 00:06:21.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Processing speed.</v>

148
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.600
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what he said was that he estimated</v>

149
00:06:24.601 --> 00:06:28.200
<v Speaker 3>that because of the way silicon works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every 18 months,</v>

150
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.760
<v Speaker 3>the speed of a computer with double or</v>
<v Speaker 3>the price would drop by half.</v>

151
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.660
<v Speaker 3>And that has been true now for more than</v>
<v Speaker 3>25 years.</v>

152
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.920
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

153
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.940
<v Speaker 3>and that thing then plays out in camera</v>
<v Speaker 3>megapixels,</v>

154
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.910
<v Speaker 3>in storage on SD cards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the size of the,</v>

155
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.020
<v Speaker 3>of your smartphone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

156
00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 3>a number of sensors you can put into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>smartphone.</v>

157
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.560
<v Speaker 3>And it's battery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Battery life is the one that's lagging</v>

158
00:06:52.561 --> 00:06:54.780
<v Speaker 3>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's the main thing that's holding</v>

159
00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:57.900
<v Speaker 3>back this technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moore's law also applies to things like</v>

160
00:06:57.901 --> 00:07:00.450
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also applies to networks like the</v>

161
00:07:00.451 --> 00:07:03.390
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what it means is that if you're in</v>

162
00:07:03.391 --> 00:07:06.540
<v Speaker 3>an industry that's established and</v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly you have a competitor that's</v>

163
00:07:06.541 --> 00:07:08.730
<v Speaker 3>coming at you with the power of Moore's</v>
<v Speaker 3>law,</v>

164
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.540
<v Speaker 3>you better watch out because you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a matter of whether you will be</v>

165
00:07:12.541 --> 00:07:16.170
<v Speaker 3>able to compete in a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a matter of whether your industry</v>

166
00:07:16.171 --> 00:07:18.540
<v Speaker 3>will still exist in a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

167
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that fascinating?</v>

168
00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:23.440
<v Speaker 1>That whole industries can just vanish</v>

169
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:27.410
<v Speaker 3>hundred and 50 years of Kodak and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly film doesn't exist.</v>

170
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.143
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

171
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.470
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
