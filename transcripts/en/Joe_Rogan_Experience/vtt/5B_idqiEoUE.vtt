<v Speaker 1>it's a good time for you to be here to</v>

18
00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:45.010
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like we might be going to war</v>

19
00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:46.390
<v Speaker 1>with North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

20
00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:47.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your book,</v>

21
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.480
<v Speaker 1>dear reader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I held it up.</v>

22
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably an important book for</v>

23
00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>people that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is going on over there?</v>

25
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.941
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I wrote it.</v>

26
00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:56.830
<v Speaker 1>So that everything you read in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>press,</v>

27
00:00:56.831 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 1>this is crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

28
00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much.</v>

29
00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

30
00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:01.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they getting wrong?</v>

31
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>They're getting wrong that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there was an article a couple of</v>

32
00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:06.880
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the example I always used where you</v>

33
00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:09.730
<v Speaker 1>had all these women marching in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pyongyang,</v>

34
00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:13.810
<v Speaker 1>the capital city and the headlines said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim Juggling's mini skirted robot army,</v>

35
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.920
<v Speaker 1>and you know how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they are all,</v>

36
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.420
<v Speaker 1>they're all brainwashed and robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're all hostages.</v>

37
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.790
<v Speaker 1>If someone puts a gun to your mom's</v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

38
00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:24.640
<v Speaker 1>you're going to march.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone puts a gun to your head,</v>

39
00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:26.710
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to do to get that kid food.</v>

40
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.670
<v Speaker 1>These are human beings who are in prison</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course they do crazy silly</v>

41
00:01:30.671 --> 00:01:31.504
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you?</v>

42
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

43
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.430
<v Speaker 1>And the press is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah.</v>

44
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.760
<v Speaker 1>It's also like they believe this silly</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

45
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.910
<v Speaker 1>You go to school and you're taught</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and if you don't believe it,</v>

46
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.210
<v Speaker 1>you go to a labor camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to smile and fucking not.</v>

47
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.020
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You read the articles and it's just like</v>

48
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.030
<v Speaker 1>liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These stupid people believe.</v>

49
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

50
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.460
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at these hostages.</v>

51
00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Believe yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a better way of putting it for</v>

52
00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:55.000
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really think though,</v>

53
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:57.430
<v Speaker 1>that people aren't aware that some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people aren't aware of it,</v>

54
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.020
<v Speaker 1>of what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of,</v>

55
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.080
<v Speaker 1>of what a dictatorship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a military dictatorship,</v>

56
00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:05.530
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have it down to 45 seconds when I did</v>

57
00:02:05.531 --> 00:02:09.460
<v Speaker 1>an interview with an NPR affiliate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman said,</v>

58
00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:10.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Il,</v>

59
00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:12.310
<v Speaker 1>so very campy figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

60
00:02:12.311 --> 00:02:13.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's uhm ill,</v>

61
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.280
<v Speaker 1>that's the one I wrote the book about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dad.</v>

62
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.500
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a very campy figure.</v>

63
00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:17.771
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

64
00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:20.740
<v Speaker 1>that's a very unfortunate choice of</v>
<v Speaker 1>words and she wants to kill herself</v>

65
00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:22.510
<v Speaker 1>because it's upon and concentration</v>
<v Speaker 1>camps,</v>

66
00:02:22.511 --> 00:02:24.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I mean if you look at like the</v>

67
00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:26.770
<v Speaker 1>interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which got it right because they said</v>

68
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:29.680
<v Speaker 1>he's an evil killer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you look a team of America and they</v>

69
00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:31.210
<v Speaker 1>look at him as this clown figure.</v>

70
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.700
<v Speaker 1>And I always say the joker from Batman</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a clown,</v>

71
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.040
<v Speaker 1>but you're not looking at all the bodies</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind him.</v>

72
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.870
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's silly and a buffoon.</v>

73
00:02:37.871 --> 00:02:40.570
<v Speaker 1>But this buffoon has millions of corpses</v>
<v Speaker 1>to his name.</v>

74
00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:43.900
<v Speaker 1>And you think it's wacky that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>marching in a parade?</v>

75
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for,</v>

76
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.240
<v Speaker 1>in team America's defense though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what those guys do and that's</v>

77
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>what they did with Saddam Hussein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember they made them the gay lover to</v>

78
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Satan of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying is I think a lot of</v>

79
00:02:53.651 --> 00:02:55.720
<v Speaker 1>people in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking at the press specifically,</v>

80
00:02:55.721 --> 00:02:58.720
<v Speaker 1>they take that they take a lot of North</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea at face value.</v>

81
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>So why I wrote the book is so like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can understand what the hell's going on</v>

82
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>there because it's all smoke and mirrors</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

83
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Well it is one of the most public and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most visible military</v>

84
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>dictatorships and still still viable.</v>

85
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2017,</v>

86
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.290
<v Speaker 1>which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

87
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of shocking that mean when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can walk down the street and Los Angeles</v>

88
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to,</v>

89
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to starbucks and get a coffee and</v>

90
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>everything's free and people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.360
<v Speaker 1>there's billboards protesting this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people talking about that.</v>

92
00:03:29.361 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom that we just completely take for</v>

93
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:33.701
<v Speaker 1>granted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think,</v>

94
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 1>well this is what life is like in 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

95
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 1>It is in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in North Korea you might as well be</v>

96
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>living a thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A actually what's funny is different</v>

97
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>people are living at different times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I landed on the plane,</v>

98
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 1>there was an army guy who stopped the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich lady and he was like from the</v>

99
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>fifties and she was from the eighties in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their clothes.</v>

100
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 1>So they have different time periods</v>
<v Speaker 1>overlapping there.</v>

101
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.890
<v Speaker 1>So how's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explain that.</v>

102
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Basically he's in fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian gear,</v>

103
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 1>like the soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he stopped shaving gear.</v>

104
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're their Soviet Soviet.</v>

105
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they really were like Russia,</v>

106
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 1>that Russia issue or a Russian style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like green and they've got the</v>

107
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looks cheap.</v>

108
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fabric,</v>

109
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.630
<v Speaker 1>it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look contemporary.</v>

110
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.130
<v Speaker 1>The cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>

111
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:19.440
<v Speaker 1>but something about the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just look at,</v>

112
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is communist era stuff and he stops</v>

113
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 1>at the airport and it's obviously like</v>
<v Speaker 1>papers please.</v>

114
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>And this was within 10 minutes of me</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in the capital and she rolls her</v>

115
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 1>eyes at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I was shocked.</v>

116
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>And she goes and she's on her cell phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's like,</v>

117
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>and she digs through her purse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows him something and he nods and she</v>

118
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:40.630
<v Speaker 1>keeps going because what's happening now</v>
<v Speaker 1>is wealthy people in North Korea can run</v>

119
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Speaker 1>the government and run their way around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the law,</v>

120
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.510
<v Speaker 1>which is great as long as they run a</v>
<v Speaker 1>foul of.</v>

121
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

122
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>But in which case they just get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depending.</v>

123
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're in power,</v>

124
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>like the laws don't apply to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that everyone's scared the</v>

125
00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:55.690
<v Speaker 1>cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's when you're,</v>

126
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.180
<v Speaker 1>when you're rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have a huge black market.</v>

127
00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:02.830
<v Speaker 1>You can bribe your way out of anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do people get rich in a communist</v>

128
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened in the nineties when</v>

129
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Il chose to have a famine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>chose to have millions of people starve</v>

130
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.320
<v Speaker 1>rather than lose his hold on power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started looking the other way and</v>

131
00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 1>all these little markets that popped up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue black markets because the</v>

132
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 1>government wasn't providing food</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

133
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 1>So people would go to China and trade</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and come back and you know,</v>

134
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:26.620
<v Speaker 1>they'd get rice and so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these markets are now the backbone in</v>

135
00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>many ways of the North Korean economy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet the cops can come and hassle</v>

136
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:32.200
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to bribe that cop.</v>

137
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.210
<v Speaker 1>But it just basically works out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks.</v>

138
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these people are essentially running</v>

139
00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 1>black markets inside of this communist</v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship and just paying off the</v>

140
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:45.340
<v Speaker 1>cops so they can keep all this going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's public,</v>

141
00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:47.000
<v Speaker 1>it's in the town square,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

142
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 1>They don't regard themselves as</v>
<v Speaker 1>communist anymore and it's not.</v>

143
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.500
<v Speaker 1>It's much closer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many ways to fascism then to Hitler</v>

144
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.180
<v Speaker 1>style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascism and communism.</v>

145
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they putting their money in a North</v>

146
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 1>Korean bank?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the trick.</v>

147
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>So they used to have like the money</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuffed in mattresses and then North</v>

148
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Korea said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're switching currency tomorrow.</v>

149
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>You got to switch it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty eight hours.</v>

150
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>And everyone started going broke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the government figures out what the</v>

151
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 1>people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's something else that goes and</v>

152
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>fucks him over every step of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's something else that used to</v>

153
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be if you go to China,</v>

154
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 1>right to escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just bribe the border guard because</v>

155
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>he's hungry and then you go to China and</v>
<v Speaker 1>do what you need to do and you come</v>

156
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

157
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Let's suppose you're trading and he gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cut now they changed it to he can keep</v>

158
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:34.460
<v Speaker 1>the bribe as long as he arrest you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He lets you go and then he comes</v>

159
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:36.110
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he takes all your shit and he keeps his</v>

160
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:38.150
<v Speaker 1>money and you get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

161
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:42.020
<v Speaker 1>So they're very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they did that to discourage bribes</v>

162
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>and encourage a wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

163
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>To keep their control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do the North Koreans know this now</v>

164
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>they stopped trying to bribe these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look after a few of them,</v>

165
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>but I'm rusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it keeps kind of changing and then</v>

166
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 1>it's all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know ahead of time.</v>

167
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like a drug deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this guy cool?</v>

168
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>Is this guy not cool?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what so much of it is like</v>

169
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.580
<v Speaker 1>know talking between the lines and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and working with people.</v>

170
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:05.050
<v Speaker 1>And who do you know and who's close and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all these slight of hand kind of</v>

171
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.780
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

172
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 1>It's just when you see something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing is in terms of what</v>

173
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.310
<v Speaker 1>the way the government is running the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

174
00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:14.910
<v Speaker 1>It's when you watch it on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

175
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.800
<v Speaker 1>My feeling is how long can they keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>this up forever,</v>

176
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.580
<v Speaker 1>you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

177
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for much longer than they should</v>

178
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 1>have because here's what happened in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

179
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 1>The famine hit right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can explain why I get into my</v>

180
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The UN came to give them food and Kim</v>

181
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Jong Il said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if the UN is giving people food,</v>

182
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:37.430
<v Speaker 1>they're not gonna need the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they would do is people in the</v>

183
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:39.230
<v Speaker 1>UN,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not allowed to have any Korean</v>

184
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 1>speakers on staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they went to village a on Monday and</v>

185
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:47.330
<v Speaker 1>they saw healthy people and they went to</v>
<v Speaker 1>village be on Tuesday and then Wednesday</v>

186
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Speaker 1>they went back to the first village and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Koreans are like,</v>

187
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:50.240
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a third village.</v>

188
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.290
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just hearing Monday.</v>

189
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:51.681
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

190
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:53.150
<v Speaker 1>you weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

191
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to tell them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And eventually the UN left.</v>

192
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:56.040
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this,</v>

193
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 1>we can't help these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were willing to let the</v>

194
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 1>population on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first village was pretending to</v>

195
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:03.150
<v Speaker 1>be a new village?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

196
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.510
<v Speaker 1>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

197
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Not even pretending it's just obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same village,</v>

198
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:09.140
<v Speaker 1>but they're lying to their site where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they saying that they were a different</v>

199
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:11.570
<v Speaker 1>village because that way they're saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>we showed you three towns and</v>

200
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:14.660
<v Speaker 1>everything's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was basically they just put people</v>

201
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:17.600
<v Speaker 1>there to act and behind the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the vice piece when</v>

202
00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Shane Smith went to North Korea and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretended to have a restaurant?</v>

203
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he got that wrong in my opinion.</v>

204
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.170
<v Speaker 1>So what the senior talking about is he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the hotel and I,</v>

205
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.730
<v Speaker 1>I think I stayed in the same room as him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that hotel,</v>

206
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 1>it's nicknamed the Alcatraz of fun</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's on an island in the middle</v>

207
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:33.860
<v Speaker 1>of the river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of young gang.</v>

208
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 1>So they took them to this ballroom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

209
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributing food to all these tables.</v>

210
00:08:38.931 --> 00:08:41.090
<v Speaker 1>But no one's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he asked the waitress,</v>

211
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas everyone,</v>

212
00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:45.500
<v Speaker 1>and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just left what I perceived that to</v>

213
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 1>be and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not inside her head.</v>

214
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in North Korea,</v>

215
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was there,</v>

216
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:51.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to figure out what the rules are</v>

217
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:53.930
<v Speaker 1>because I was born in the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had these little rules to figure out</v>

218
00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 1>what works and what does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what it was is you can never</v>

219
00:08:56.521 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge anything's wrong because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>

220
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 1>that's complaining and complaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizing the government.</v>

221
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 1>So if he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she had said this,</v>

222
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 1>food's all wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's making complaint.</v>

223
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if she is doing improv and she's</v>

224
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:10.500
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's fine,</v>

225
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.050
<v Speaker 1>then the best you can to come up with is</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone just left this.</v>

226
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Everything's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to maintain disappearance that</v>

227
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:19.050
<v Speaker 1>everything's good all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His perception was,</v>

228
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 1>and she's on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep that in mind.</v>

229
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Does she know what she's on camera for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

230
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if you're a hostage on</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera,</v>

231
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:30.540
<v Speaker 1>you're going to smile and nod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aren't the worst one was Laura Ling,</v>

232
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was interviewing this family in the</v>

233
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:35.670
<v Speaker 1>capital city and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can Kim Jong Il do anything wrong?</v>

234
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.460
<v Speaker 1>And they pretended that they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand her and she,</v>

235
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.510
<v Speaker 1>and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

236
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:41.850
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're asking a family on camera to</v>

237
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:44.470
<v Speaker 1>criticize the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you and are you insane?</v>

238
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is wrong with you woman?</v>

239
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's the wrong way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

240
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Shane's perception was that they had set</v>
<v Speaker 1>this place up as a restaurant and it</v>

241
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:56.760
<v Speaker 1>wasn't really a restaurant because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really have restaurants per se,</v>

242
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:02.090
<v Speaker 1>and that they were trying to pretend and</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on this air like they were a normal</v>

243
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.430
<v Speaker 1>society and you can just go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant and bar some food.</v>

244
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 1>But when he went in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said the whole thing was clearly set</v>

245
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:10.920
<v Speaker 1>up just for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's I,</v>

246
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to that restaurant he went</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

247
00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:13.620
<v Speaker 1>So I can't speak on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

248
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.620
<v Speaker 1>And I went later than him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do have restaurants for sure in</v>

249
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Pyongyang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to several.</v>

250
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:19.480
<v Speaker 1>They're crappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

251
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.070
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of the stuff that is for show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty easy to tell what's for</v>

252
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.470
<v Speaker 1>showing what isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if he's saying that this whole thing</v>

253
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:27.120
<v Speaker 1>was a setup just for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's plausible.</v>

254
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was what he was thinking.</v>

255
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.640
<v Speaker 1>He was thinking that they were putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>on like a big pr display for him because</v>

256
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:35.070
<v Speaker 1>when I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go to the maternity hospital,</v>

257
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.980
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that stuff is clearly for show</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's computers but they're</v>

258
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:40.110
<v Speaker 1>not even plugged in maternity hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

259
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.820
<v Speaker 1>They're very proud of their maternity</v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital,</v>

260
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 1>maternity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paternity to where you have kids.</v>

261
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.710
<v Speaker 1>What's a maternity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

262
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I think Russia now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have computers that aren't even</v>

263
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:51.234
<v Speaker 1>plugged in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

264
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Why do they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's,</v>

265
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.150
<v Speaker 1>what's fake about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the computers are for display</v>

266
00:10:57.151 --> 00:10:58.260
<v Speaker 1>purposes only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

267
00:10:58.261 --> 00:10:59.071
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we go online,</v>

268
00:10:59.071 --> 00:11:01.950
<v Speaker 1>we are advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have science and you know,</v>

269
00:11:01.951 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 1>you go into a lab and someone's at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>microscope,</v>

270
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting edge technology,</v>

271
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.050
<v Speaker 1>they don't look up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like listen,</v>

272
00:11:07.051 --> 00:11:09.480
<v Speaker 1>if you're working at a microscope and 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>people walk in the room,</v>

273
00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:10.950
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to glance stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>instinctively.</v>

274
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:15.780
<v Speaker 1>So everyone essentially as a hostage</v>
<v Speaker 1>from even from the police down to the</v>

275
00:11:15.781 --> 00:11:18.540
<v Speaker 1>doctors to including the leaders</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

276
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.800
<v Speaker 1>So when these countries liberalized like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya and Iraq,</v>

277
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.820
<v Speaker 1>the leaders themselves are killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if Kim Jong going wanted things</v>

278
00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:29.370
<v Speaker 1>to loosen up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to get a bullet in him and</v>

279
00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:32.850
<v Speaker 1>with good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a system where everyone is a</v>

280
00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:33.270
<v Speaker 1>prisoner.</v>

281
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Il became a big missed because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he married a woman in secret and then</v>

282
00:11:38.041 --> 00:11:39.060
<v Speaker 1>his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great leader,</v>

283
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Kim Il Sung was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when are you going to get married?</v>

284
00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:42.420
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>student Dad soon.</v>

285
00:11:42.421 --> 00:11:44.190
<v Speaker 1>And then his dad's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a wife for you.</v>

286
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.270
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

287
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.110
<v Speaker 1>So he married a second woman and kept</v>
<v Speaker 1>his first emily and hidden compound.</v>

288
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.210
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was that first son who was just</v>

289
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 1>recently killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

290
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:57.280
<v Speaker 1>And this was the son that was killed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Aoun because they thought that</v>

291
00:11:57.281 --> 00:11:59.530
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to organize a coup</v>
<v Speaker 1>against him.</v>

292
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even if they're trying.</v>

293
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:05.620
<v Speaker 1>So North Korea has a constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is for display purposes only,</v>

294
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:09.460
<v Speaker 1>but what really governs the country is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 10 commandments of Kim Il Sung.</v>

295
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 1>And the 10th commandment is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it is,</v>

296
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 1>something there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the revolution shall be continued</v>

297
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:16.030
<v Speaker 1>through the generations until it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>completed.</v>

298
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Which means only a descendant of Kim Il</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sung can be the leader.</v>

299
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 1>So Kim Jong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Il had three sons.</v>

300
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.000
<v Speaker 1>The middle one is a sissy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he doesn't count.</v>

301
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.110
<v Speaker 1>He's assisted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

302
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.590
<v Speaker 1>they said he's too much like a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's all we know about him.</v>

303
00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:32.740
<v Speaker 1>And he's a big Eric Clapton for certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>pit all like this guy,</v>

304
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.640
<v Speaker 1>pictures of this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some online.</v>

305
00:12:34.641 --> 00:12:37.580
<v Speaker 1>You sit in their shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Off they left.</v>

306
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.430
<v Speaker 1>So the eldest son was Kim Jong Nam and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the youngest was Kim Jong,</v>

307
00:12:42.431 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Il and Kim Jong Nam wanted to liberalize</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong.</v>

308
00:12:46.211 --> 00:12:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Il Said No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if Kim Jong UN is going to be</v>

309
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:50.830
<v Speaker 1>replaced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only one who could have replaced him</v>

310
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 1>was his older brother Kim Jong Nam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if he's killed,</v>

311
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:56.670
<v Speaker 1>that's an insurance policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

312
00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.100
<v Speaker 1>So he killed him just to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't overthrown.</v>

313
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he killed his sons to right now he</v>

314
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:04.310
<v Speaker 1>killed his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

315
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.130
<v Speaker 1>his aunt's husband.</v>

316
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she drove his,</v>

317
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.900
<v Speaker 1>her daughter to suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are,</v>

318
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.150
<v Speaker 1>it's game of thrones in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six,</v>

319
00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:14.140
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six stuff.</v>

320
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.530
<v Speaker 1>And they boast about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I was doing my research for</v>

321
00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:18.730
<v Speaker 1>the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

322
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.170
<v Speaker 1>they boast about all the shit they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like North Korea was recently criticized</v>

323
00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:28.150
<v Speaker 1>by the UN for having concentration camps</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they literally said we don't use</v>

324
00:13:28.151 --> 00:13:31.240
<v Speaker 1>that term so we don't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was their response.</v>

325
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.640
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

326
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.820
<v Speaker 1>they've got a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

327
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Case case claims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they don't use the point,</v>

328
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.560
<v Speaker 1>they don't use that term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

329
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

330
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.280
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many layers of hell in this</v>

331
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:43.510
<v Speaker 1>country that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

332
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why I like speaking about it is</v>

333
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.230
<v Speaker 1>someone's got to do it and people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what's going on and it's,</v>

334
00:13:50.231 --> 00:13:52.150
<v Speaker 1>it kinda bothers me.</v>

335
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you hear people on TV trying to</v>

336
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:56.470
<v Speaker 1>give their opinion and they don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual data,</v>

337
00:13:56.471 --> 00:13:58.740
<v Speaker 1>it's so much worse than people think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

338
00:13:58.741 --> 00:14:02.080
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we have a very peripheral knowledge</v>

339
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:04.510
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in terms of like what's put out on</v>

340
00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:06.790
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that it's bad,</v>

341
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.880
<v Speaker 1>but we know that it's a dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that the people are under the</v>

342
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:11.140
<v Speaker 1>iron thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

343
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:12.760
<v Speaker 1>But we don't know too much more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

344
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had to do all the homework and now</v>

345
00:14:16.391 --> 00:14:18.310
<v Speaker 1>you can read this book and now you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you need to know.</v>

346
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.370
<v Speaker 1>And when you went over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

347
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.600
<v Speaker 1>what year did you go over there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2012.</v>

348
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.430
<v Speaker 1>So Kim John took over in 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eleven.</v>

349
00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:29.050
<v Speaker 1>So he had already taken over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

350
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.730
<v Speaker 1>So what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the.</v>

351
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.460
<v Speaker 1>This was like post all the crying and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the streets.</v>

352
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the craziness.</v>

353
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you want to be there for that?</v>

354
00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:40.480
<v Speaker 1>That must've been fascinating to watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's nothing in North Korea</v>

355
00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:42.940
<v Speaker 1>that's not fascinating because when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going through the city,</v>

356
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the countryside,</v>

357
00:14:44.141 --> 00:14:46.420
<v Speaker 1>everything's there for a reason and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking around,</v>

358
00:14:46.421 --> 00:14:47.740
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did they make this like this?</v>

359
00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:49.660
<v Speaker 1>And you're not going to have an answer</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everything is constructed,</v>

360
00:14:49.661 --> 00:14:53.030
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're trying to find analogs between</v>

361
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.310
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you know to be saying and what they</v>

362
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:59.420
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it's not obvious I was,</v>

363
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.460
<v Speaker 1>they showed us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took us to this place and they</v>

364
00:15:01.461 --> 00:15:05.270
<v Speaker 1>claim that there's an invisible wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we built that separates the Koreas</v>

365
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can only see the wall from the</v>

366
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:10.010
<v Speaker 1>north and this is to keep the Koreas</v>
<v Speaker 1>divided permanently.</v>

367
00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:11.790
<v Speaker 1>I got the brochure and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the you,</v>

368
00:15:11.791 --> 00:15:13.340
<v Speaker 1>your little telescope and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I looking at?</v>

369
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Is this a wall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the path isn't mountainside.</v>

370
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.740
<v Speaker 1>And there was a praying mantis there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I told my guide,</v>

371
00:15:18.741 --> 00:15:19.760
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

372
00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:22.190
<v Speaker 1>I thought this was a communist country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And atheist country wise,</v>

373
00:15:22.191 --> 00:15:23.630
<v Speaker 1>they're praying Mantis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ha ha.</v>

374
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:24.980
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

375
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:26.480
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm like,</v>

376
00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:27.110
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

377
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're not going to call a</v>
<v Speaker 1>praying mantis.</v>

378
00:15:28.641 --> 00:15:30.620
<v Speaker 1>They must have a different word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

379
00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:32.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this reminds me of my favorite fable,</v>

380
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.220
<v Speaker 1>the Fox in the Scorpion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

381
00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 1>the Fox and Scorpion one across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>river.</v>

382
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:37.860
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

383
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.840
<v Speaker 1>it's either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

384
00:15:38.841 --> 00:15:41.330
<v Speaker 1>So we could do frog and score for foxes</v>
<v Speaker 1>can swim.</v>

385
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.330
<v Speaker 1>That's where the frogs can swim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two Scorpion.</v>

386
00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:44.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

387
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.950
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>

388
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.350
<v Speaker 1>So the frog says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

389
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:53.420
<v Speaker 1>the Scorpion says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me hop on your back so I can cross</v>

390
00:15:53.421 --> 00:15:54.380
<v Speaker 1>the river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the frog goes,</v>

391
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:56.540
<v Speaker 1>had I know you won't sting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Scorpion goes,</v>

392
00:15:56.541 --> 00:15:58.640
<v Speaker 1>if I stinky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we both drowned and halfway through the</v>

393
00:15:58.641 --> 00:16:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Scorpion stings him and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frog goes,</v>

394
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.230
<v Speaker 1>why'd you Stingley road dying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Scorpion goes,</v>

395
00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:05.810
<v Speaker 1>that's my nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I told this to my God and she's</v>

396
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:06.710
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a scorpion?</v>

397
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:07.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

398
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.590
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the lobster that lives in the</v>

399
00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 1>desert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she has no idea.</v>

400
00:16:10.461 --> 00:16:11.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I draw it.</v>

401
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.130
<v Speaker 1>She'd never heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think how many times you've</v>

402
00:16:15.131 --> 00:16:17.690
<v Speaker 1>heard of a scorpion from comic books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from nature shows,</v>

403
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.330
<v Speaker 1>from nature books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

404
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.860
<v Speaker 1>just logos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horoscope,</v>

405
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.240
<v Speaker 1>and it's like holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like her level of what is known is so</v>

406
00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:29.720
<v Speaker 1>limited that even something as basic as</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is completely foreign to her</v>

407
00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:31.910
<v Speaker 1>because they don't have scorpions in</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea,</v>

408
00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:32.900
<v Speaker 1>so you don't need to know about it.</v>

409
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.130
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so fascinating that in the same</v>

410
00:16:37.131 --> 00:16:42.131
<v Speaker 1>time period as the internet and Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber Satellites,</v>

411
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Ilan mosque,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the crazy shit that we're</v>

412
00:16:44.931 --> 00:16:48.410
<v Speaker 1>experiencing that these people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially completely isolated.</v>

413
00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other than what,</v>

414
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.890
<v Speaker 1>how many websites is like 18 websites or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that?</v>

415
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Very low on their North Korean internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intranet.</v>

416
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intranet.</v>

417
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

418
00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Which for folks like intranet is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations and companies use to share</v>

419
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.260
<v Speaker 1>in internal knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they have a system set up like</v>

420
00:17:06.261 --> 00:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>that and so these people that want to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote online,</v>

421
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.710
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting only very few people are</v>

422
00:17:12.711 --> 00:17:15.080
<v Speaker 1>going to have that access also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

423
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's terrifying.</v>

424
00:17:16.581 --> 00:17:19.610
<v Speaker 1>It's horrifying and it doesn't seem like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a solution,</v>

425
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's also amazing and it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be this way.</v>

426
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could be done?</v>

427
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.810
<v Speaker 1>I just mean this is being done</v>
<v Speaker 1>intentionally.</v>

428
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

429
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.540
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is being done methodically.</v>

430
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:32.320
<v Speaker 1>So when I was doing the research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

431
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russian writer,</v>

432
00:17:34.281 --> 00:17:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Iran said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

433
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.120
<v Speaker 1>heirs of this magnitude I'd never made</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocently.</v>

434
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.060
<v Speaker 1>So this was a step by step process from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great leader,</v>

435
00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Kim Il Sung and the director Kim Jong</v>
<v Speaker 1>Il,</v>

436
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:48.050
<v Speaker 1>to slowly close the walls and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and to keep it as airtight and as</v>

437
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.360
<v Speaker 1>much like a prison as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very step by step by step over</v>

438
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:52.590
<v Speaker 1>the decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

439
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.241
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

440
00:17:53.241 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 1>as you read the history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just feel the walls closing</v>

441
00:17:56.941 --> 00:18:00.510
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we were talking recently about the</v>

442
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:02.790
<v Speaker 1>wailing and the streets when Kim Jong Il</v>
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>

443
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:06.620
<v Speaker 1>And about how people who did not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't cry hard enough,</v>

444
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.940
<v Speaker 1>were sentenced to six months of hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>labor.</v>

445
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they have there is,</v>

446
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people again,</v>

447
00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:14.130
<v Speaker 1>when you think it's just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship,</v>

448
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.460
<v Speaker 1>so everyone in North Korea is slotted</v>
<v Speaker 1>into some group,</v>

449
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.530
<v Speaker 1>like your school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your workplace,</v>

450
00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:21.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe the young workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women's,</v>

451
00:18:21.241 --> 00:18:22.020
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

452
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Once a week your whole group has to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and you have to stand up and</v>

453
00:18:26.611 --> 00:18:30.600
<v Speaker 1>say what you did wrong and then your</v>
<v Speaker 1>other friends have to get up and</v>

454
00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:33.810
<v Speaker 1>denounce you and say what they saw you</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing wrong and they better have</v>

455
00:18:33.811 --> 00:18:34.980
<v Speaker 1>something to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

456
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.860
<v Speaker 1>So everyone is watching each other all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

457
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.990
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like Aa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

458
00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 1>like from hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this has been going on since the</v>

459
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.160
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people are like,</v>

460
00:18:44.161 --> 00:18:45.480
<v Speaker 1>why don't they just get together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolt?</v>

461
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.290
<v Speaker 1>You can't revolt when everyone around</v>
<v Speaker 1>you is looking to make sure they have</v>

462
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:51.120
<v Speaker 1>something to tell about you at your</v>
<v Speaker 1>weekly meeting.</v>

464
00:18:53.371 --> 00:18:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing when people like these</v>

00:18:54.841 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 1>people are crazy and stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is brilliant.</v>

466
00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.700
<v Speaker 1>They have it all worked out and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>working for them.</v>

467
00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a conspiracy at the highest level.</v>

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really is the entire country is a</v>

469
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.530
<v Speaker 1>massive conspiracy.</v>

470
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Fucking stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

471
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.090
<v Speaker 1>when you really look at it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is how many million people?</v>

472
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 1>A 24 million.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

474
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.400
<v Speaker 1>And that they've been put in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's like,</v>

475
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:19.740

<v Speaker 1>they've outlasted everybody except for</v>

476
00:19:19.741 --> 00:19:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the last one standing and they</v>

477
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.370
<v Speaker 1>gloat about it and they should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>gloating about it.</v>

478
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.790
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but prison,</v>

479
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles was a prison but larger than</v>

480
00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you guys have warm weather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have cold weather and they don't</v>

482
00:19:33.991 --> 00:19:36.420
<v Speaker 1>have warm clothes and the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

484
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even just the population size of Los</v>

485
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Angeles and yet everyone's a prisoner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's a prison.</v>

486
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking incredible.</v>

487
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.810
<v Speaker 1>So I just want people to keep that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind next time they are laughing at one</v>

488
00:19:48.811 --> 00:19:51.930
<v Speaker 1>of these articles or like how stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are.</v>

489
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like you are going to believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you need to believe in prison.</v>

490
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Well people don't really look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you see these goofy fucking</v>

491
00:19:57.661 --> 00:19:58.470
<v Speaker 1>haircut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

492
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:59.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

493
00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.910
<v Speaker 1>there was some sketch recently where he</v>
<v Speaker 1>made everybody get the same haircut.</v>

494
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.270
<v Speaker 1>That's a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a sketch comedy sketch,</v>

495
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.860
<v Speaker 1>but it was just there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

496
00:20:07.861 --> 00:20:08.341
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

497
00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:09.580
<v Speaker 1>this is a stupid aircraft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

498
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's Britney spears up to her?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just going crazy with Jennifer Lopez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grow toward.</v>

500
00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Were those Kim Kim corridor ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a girls and we just move on to</v>

501
00:20:18.931 --> 00:20:22.230
<v Speaker 1>the next ridiculous thing and the reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has that haircut is because that's</v>

502
00:20:22.231 --> 00:20:25.200
<v Speaker 1>the haircut that great leader his</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandfather had in the forties.</v>

503
00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.780
<v Speaker 1>So He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm my grant.</v>

504
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:31.770
<v Speaker 1>When Kim Jong Il took over in 1994,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his campaign slogan was,</v>

505
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.970
<v Speaker 1>do not expect any change for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was literally on the billboards.</v>

506
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.320
<v Speaker 1>I am the same person as my dad was who</v>
<v Speaker 1>got in trouble recently for having a</v>

507
00:20:40.321 --> 00:20:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Hitler haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a story recently,</v>

508
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 1>someone in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kid in Europe was kicked</v>

509
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.440
<v Speaker 2>out of something for essentially having</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Hitler haircut,</v>

510
00:20:50.441 --> 00:20:52.540
<v Speaker 2>which is like today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend Moshe,</v>

511
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.750
<v Speaker 2>Moshe Kasher has a Hitler haircut and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just a hipster.</v>

512
00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Hitler youth had that couple of years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

513
00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like shaved on the sides and I kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of have a little bit.</v>

514
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you lift the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grow a little bit more.</v>

515
00:21:03.581 --> 00:21:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean that's a,</v>

516
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:09.520
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of like what he's rocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's rocking this retro haircut.</v>

517
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

518
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.120
<v Speaker 2>And with good reason and we think it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>silly.</v>

519
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:13.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

520
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:14.880
<v Speaker 2>we just hee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he ha ha.</v>

521
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile we're watching this mass</v>

522
00:21:17.351 --> 00:21:18.760
<v Speaker 2>atrocity go on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

523
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny for me because every time</v>

524
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.010
<v Speaker 2>I talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone I met is still there.</v>

525
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Like everyone I saw on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still there.</v>

526
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Every little kid I saw still there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my guide is still there.</v>

527
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a very sweet young lady and it</v>

528
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.360
<v Speaker 2>was heartbreaking and I hate being one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those people who like,</v>

529
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:35.740
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went on this trip and it changed my</v>

530
00:21:35.741 --> 00:21:36.201
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

531
00:21:36.201 --> 00:21:37.240
<v Speaker 2>like the whole facebook shit.</v>

532
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.740
<v Speaker 2>But it fucks with your head for years</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of being Jewish,</v>

533
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:43.320
<v Speaker 2>being born in the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were,</v>

534
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.790
<v Speaker 2>this is why I took on this project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are chances for me to have been in</v>

535
00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:46.391
<v Speaker 2>a camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

536
00:21:46.391 --> 00:21:48.400
<v Speaker 2>back in the day for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to see.</v>

537
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:50.740
<v Speaker 2>My friend is also from Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

538
00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:53.890
<v Speaker 2>it looks like Russian people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the architecture and the clothes,</v>

539
00:21:53.891 --> 00:21:55.480
<v Speaker 2>but it's just Asian people in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

540
00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:56.470
<v Speaker 2>it's a total mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

541
00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also fascinating when you consider</v>

542
00:21:58.661 --> 00:22:03.040
<v Speaker 2>the small amount of time between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration camps or the Holocaust and</v>

543
00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:04.960
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we look,</v>

544
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost 50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I turned 50 in August,</v>

545
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:12.390
<v Speaker 2>which when I was a child seemed like an</v>
<v Speaker 2>eternity and now as a man is almost 50.</v>

546
00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:14.380
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

547
00:22:14.381 --> 00:22:14.980
<v Speaker 2>the rush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

548
00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:15.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

549
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.680
<v Speaker 2>Which is 50 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

550
00:22:17.681 --> 00:22:19.510
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just out of the Holocaust,</v>

551
00:22:19.511 --> 00:22:21.550
<v Speaker 2>but 50 years ago we're just into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam war.</v>

552
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

553
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so quick.</v>

554
00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.770
<v Speaker 2>It's so recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

555
00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:30.780
<v Speaker 2>what we think of as modern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think of as like modern civilization.</v>

556
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.210
<v Speaker 2>It's only modern civilization and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of spots.</v>

557
00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was the attitude right before</v>

558
00:22:36.611 --> 00:22:37.640
<v Speaker 2>World War One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember,</v>

559
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.010
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're civilized now.</v>

560
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.280
<v Speaker 2>There's never going to be wars again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got all figured out and then World</v>

561
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.530
<v Speaker 2>War One happens and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck just happened when I was a</v>

562
00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:47.360
<v Speaker 2>boy I was living in San Francisco and</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

563
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:51.550
<v Speaker 2>it was all like we were right off of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lombard street is where we lived,</v>

564
00:22:51.551 --> 00:22:54.320
<v Speaker 2>was a really crooked street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

565
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.290
<v Speaker 2>I remember when the Vietnam War ended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember because I remember thinking,</v>

566
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad they figured this out was a</v>

567
00:23:03.191 --> 00:23:04.150
<v Speaker 2>little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

568
00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:05.620
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're done with war.</v>

569
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I was,</v>

570
00:23:08.291 --> 00:23:13.291
<v Speaker 2>I think I was 21 or 22 thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 21 when the Gulf War broke out and</v>

571
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:16.150
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting there with my friend</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy,</v>

572
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.720
<v Speaker 2>my roommate at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're sitting in our apartment watching</v>

573
00:23:19.721 --> 00:23:23.140
<v Speaker 2>the missiles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They showed that night vision scene of</v>

574
00:23:23.141 --> 00:23:25.510
<v Speaker 2>the missiles flying and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit Buddy,</v>

575
00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:27.040
<v Speaker 2>we're at fucking war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

576
00:23:27.041 --> 00:23:29.380
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought we were done with this.</v>

577
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you mean the second Iraq war?</v>

578
00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.810
<v Speaker 2>The first one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

579
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:35.640
<v Speaker 2>Desert Storm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was what it was at 89,</v>

580
00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.493
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>99,</v>

581
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.150
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around that and so I was 2198.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 90?</v>

582
00:23:40.151 --> 00:23:40.984
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

583
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.380
<v Speaker 2>Stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me at the time because I was like,</v>

584
00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:45.650
<v Speaker 2>how is this possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>

585
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 2>We're still</v>

586
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.780
<v Speaker 3>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought we were done.</v>

587
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.990
<v Speaker 3>I thought we were finished with Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought we realized like as a culture,</v>

588
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.880
<v Speaker 3>like hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something we need to evolve</v>

589
00:23:52.881 --> 00:23:54.890
<v Speaker 3>past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just so recent.</v>

590
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.880
<v Speaker 3>There's so much pro war propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like on the one hand you'll hear how bad</v>

591
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:03.140
<v Speaker 3>war is and then you'll hear the</v>
<v Speaker 3>glorification of FDR and Woodrow Wilson</v>

592
00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:04.790
<v Speaker 3>and like if you look at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cold War,</v>

593
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:07.430
<v Speaker 3>Reagan Thatcher and Gorbachev,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they ended it without a shot.</v>

594
00:24:07.431 --> 00:24:11.390
<v Speaker 3>They fried half the world from this</v>
<v Speaker 3>communist dictatorship and that's almost</v>

595
00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:13.580
<v Speaker 3>like an asterisk and it's like that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way to do it.</v>

596
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.510
<v Speaker 3>Like if you want to end a war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it peacefully and without the body</v>

597
00:24:17.511 --> 00:24:19.520
<v Speaker 3>count.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to avoid the body count.</v>

598
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:22.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't want the funerals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want the destroyed buildings and</v>

599
00:24:22.341 --> 00:24:24.160
<v Speaker 3>people just on some level of revel in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

600
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.740
<v Speaker 3>Both in the right and the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

601
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:29.330
<v Speaker 3>one thing that's undisputable is that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look back a long enough,</v>

602
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:33.860
<v Speaker 3>we are clearly evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human beings are across the board pretty</v>

603
00:24:33.861 --> 00:24:36.080
<v Speaker 3>much except for places like North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Steven Pinker,</v>

604
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:37.130
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

605
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.420
<v Speaker 3>Perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he's talking about is if you go</v>

606
00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Speaker 3>what anybody's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go back a thousand years ago and</v>

607
00:24:44.721 --> 00:24:48.740
<v Speaker 3>you look at today with it's inarguable</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is a far safer place to live.</v>

608
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.210
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Far more inclusive.</v>

609
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.980
<v Speaker 3>People are far more understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compassionate and far more willing to be</v>

610
00:24:54.981 --> 00:24:57.260
<v Speaker 3>open to strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different world,</v>

611
00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:02.980
<v Speaker 3>but like how does anyone get past this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing that freaks me out</v>

612
00:25:04.281 --> 00:25:05.750
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to something like North</v>
<v Speaker 3>Korea.</v>

613
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:10.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you have this absolute</v>
<v Speaker 3>power at the top,</v>

614
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.700
<v Speaker 3>like Libya,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when Walmart Kadafi was killed and</v>

615
00:25:13.701 --> 00:25:17.360
<v Speaker 3>then you get rid of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have this fucking chaos.</v>

616
00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.210
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how does that ever help those people</v>

617
00:25:20.211 --> 00:25:22.460
<v Speaker 3>that lived there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like those people that live</v>

618
00:25:22.461 --> 00:25:23.960
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those 20 plus million people that live</v>

619
00:25:23.961 --> 00:25:26.780
<v Speaker 3>in North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like they can't be fixed.</v>

620
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:27.290
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

621
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:29.300
<v Speaker 3>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what I meant.</v>

622
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.020
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mean like it's impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean it's like they're so</v>

623
00:25:33.021 --> 00:25:37.160
<v Speaker 3>programmed to living in this environment</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're so under the grip of this</v>

624
00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:37.820
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

625
00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.580
<v Speaker 3>If you take that guy out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you think there'll be some kind of</v>

626
00:25:40.581 --> 00:25:43.430
<v Speaker 3>a massive power vacuum that some will</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to fill a.</v>

627
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.230
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one concern.</v>

628
00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:47.510
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've met refugees and they're the</v>

629
00:25:47.511 --> 00:25:50.120
<v Speaker 3>most annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boring teenagers you'd ever hope to</v>

630
00:25:50.121 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 3>meet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is great because I want my goal is</v>

631
00:25:53.661 --> 00:25:55.640
<v Speaker 3>that a wish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want these people to be sitting on</v>

632
00:25:55.641 --> 00:26:00.641
<v Speaker 3>lazy boys with their bucket of Kimchi</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the pounder and watching two pounder</v>

633
00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.520
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a beer.</v>

634
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.300
<v Speaker 3>The telomere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

635
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just watching tv like everybody,</v>

636
00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.740
<v Speaker 3>everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they have the right to just be lazy</v>

637
00:26:06.741 --> 00:26:08.720
<v Speaker 3>assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's all I want for these people</v>

638
00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.960
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of times they are very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get acclimated pretty easily.</v>

639
00:26:15.171 --> 00:26:17.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a big surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Individuals,</v>

640
00:26:17.301 --> 00:26:19.550
<v Speaker 3>if they leave that environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm talking about is the</v>

641
00:26:19.551 --> 00:26:22.550
<v Speaker 3>environment itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be extremely tough</v>

642
00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:27.500
<v Speaker 3>transition because it's been 70 years of</v>
<v Speaker 3>dictatorship and abuse in isolation,</v>

643
00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have a country that's</v>

644
00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.260
<v Speaker 3>programmed in that way that essentially</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been programmed from birth and I was</v>

645
00:26:33.261 --> 00:26:37.160
<v Speaker 3>reading an article about a kid that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>born in a prison camp escape from camp</v>

646
00:26:37.161 --> 00:26:38.120
<v Speaker 3>14.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

647
00:26:38.121 --> 00:26:40.190
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is horrific,</v>

648
00:26:40.191 --> 00:26:42.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is a horrific account of</v>

649
00:26:42.451 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 3>like the different stages</v>

650
00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.400
<v Speaker 1>of physical depletion that the prisoners</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be like.</v>

651
00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:50.010
<v Speaker 1>So like if you're at this stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be assigned to physical labor</v>

652
00:26:50.011 --> 00:26:52.230
<v Speaker 1>and you get to this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do physical labor anymore and</v>

653
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.500
<v Speaker 1>he's drawing pictures of what these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people look like and if you kill</v>

654
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:57.720
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your family has to fulfill your quota.</v>

655
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.800
<v Speaker 1>So even death is not an escape from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korean regime is.</v>

656
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>

657
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is there even a conceivable plan?</v>

658
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.080
<v Speaker 1>The only way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

659
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.800
<v Speaker 1>China doesn't want 24 million people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't speak Chinese,</v>

660
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.170
<v Speaker 1>who have no skills whatsoever crossing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two men and Yellow River's</v>

661
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.050
<v Speaker 1>intervention area and setting up camp</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

662
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.980
<v Speaker 1>That's their concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However they started backing down and</v>

663
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:26.380
<v Speaker 1>that's the greatest possible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what would happen is household</v>

664
00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:28.200
<v Speaker 1>backing down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning they started standing up to</v>

665
00:27:28.201 --> 00:27:29.034
<v Speaker 1>North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>

666
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.050
<v Speaker 1>they were like refusing to exports.</v>

667
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:33.750
<v Speaker 1>They sat down with trump and clearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about North Korea.</v>

668
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.740
<v Speaker 1>There's no way trump is running his</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth without having a plan with them.</v>

669
00:27:37.741 --> 00:27:40.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were very friendly with Mara Lago.</v>

670
00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so golf.</v>

671
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:45.270
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like golf and hookers don't like</v>

672
00:27:45.271 --> 00:27:46.980
<v Speaker 1>golf somebody because that's the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

673
00:27:46.981 --> 00:27:49.170
<v Speaker 1>It's capitalist now had this whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>against golf.</v>

674
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.790
<v Speaker 1>This was a big controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

675
00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:51.450
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

676
00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.580
<v Speaker 1>it's the sport of millionaires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

677
00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:54.390
<v Speaker 1>I say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

678
00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.030
<v Speaker 1>but isn't China like a totally different</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment now we're getting off track</v>

679
00:27:57.031 --> 00:27:59.340
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want continue less joking</v>

680
00:27:59.341 --> 00:28:01.470
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is once that government is</v>

681
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:03.600
<v Speaker 1>somehow vanished and I have no idea how</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would happen,</v>

682
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.940
<v Speaker 1>you would have to have China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

683
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:09.960
<v Speaker 1>South Korea and Japan and us working</v>
<v Speaker 1>together to kind of have a Marshall Plan</v>

684
00:28:09.961 --> 00:28:11.940
<v Speaker 1>of some kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way that's going to</v>

685
00:28:11.941 --> 00:28:12.330
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

686
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.750
<v Speaker 1>And even in a Marshall Plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

687
00:28:13.751 --> 00:28:17.850
<v Speaker 1>how do you deal with all those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and give them meaningful employment and</v>

688
00:28:17.851 --> 00:28:22.851
<v Speaker 1>give them some sort of a new philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a new culture or new.</v>

689
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it would be that hard</v>

690
00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.160
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't because it's not.</v>

691
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.210
<v Speaker 1>There's not like there's agent like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

692
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:32.490
<v Speaker 1>the Muslim Brotherhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

693
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:35.280
<v Speaker 1>These are people who want food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes,</v>

694
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.740
<v Speaker 1>a roof over their heads and</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities for their kids.</v>

695
00:28:37.741 --> 00:28:42.270
<v Speaker 1>South Korea who's the same people has</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest per capita income of any</v>

696
00:28:42.271 --> 00:28:43.800
<v Speaker 1>country in Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is saying a lot,</v>

697
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:47.160
<v Speaker 1>so it would just be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would not be easy and it would be a</v>

698
00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:51.240
<v Speaker 1>long process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it would be as much of</v>

699
00:28:51.241 --> 00:28:54.060
<v Speaker 1>a shit show as like Libya or Syria or</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of these other places.</v>

700
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.480
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think it'd be easier?</v>

701
00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Because I think once they find out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much they've been lied to and now they</v>

702
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.860
<v Speaker 1>have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look it just go to this office work nine</v>

703
00:29:04.861 --> 00:29:05.510
<v Speaker 1>to five gifts.</v>

704
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.380
<v Speaker 1>They're very hard working because their</v>
<v Speaker 1>slaves.</v>

705
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they don't sound like they don't have</v>

706
00:29:09.391 --> 00:29:11.310
<v Speaker 1>a work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they're not ambitious,</v>

707
00:29:11.311 --> 00:29:14.250
<v Speaker 1>it's just like they're ambitious gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>get them nowhere and frankly the ones</v>

708
00:29:14.251 --> 00:29:17.610
<v Speaker 1>who were the most loyal to the regime</v>
<v Speaker 1>were the ones who starved in the</v>

709
00:29:17.611 --> 00:29:19.200
<v Speaker 1>nineties because they thought food's</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming,</v>

710
00:29:19.201 --> 00:29:20.250
<v Speaker 1>food's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food's coming,</v>

711
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.860
<v Speaker 1>and the ones who are shady and who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

712
00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:25.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get fed by any means</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

713
00:29:25.051 --> 00:29:27.420
<v Speaker 1>Who are entrepreneurial?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones who survived.</v>

714
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.590
<v Speaker 1>When you left that place and you got</v>
<v Speaker 1>back home and you're sitting there and</v>

715
00:29:31.591 --> 00:29:35.550
<v Speaker 1>you're about to put this book together</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're thinking about this world</v>

716
00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.260
<v Speaker 1>that you just escaped from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

717
00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:39.330
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does this play out?</v>

718
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you,</v>

719
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.890
<v Speaker 1>did you think like where this goes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you like look at what you saw and</v>

720
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.280
<v Speaker 1>come up with some possible scenarios for</v>
<v Speaker 1>how this eventually plays out?</v>

721
00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one quote from either having their</v>

722
00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Steinbeck and the quote was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you go bankrupt two ways</v>

723
00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:59.440
<v Speaker 1>gradually and then suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's going to happen overnight.</v>

724
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.450
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to see it coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

725
00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all those countries around North</v>

726
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've agreed it's a problem.</v>

727
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.280
<v Speaker 1>All those country like this is a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare.</v>

728
00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:11.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think just like with the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>world war,</v>

729
00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Gulf War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would very quickly get together and</v>

730
00:30:13.721 --> 00:30:14.111
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

731
00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:16.180
<v Speaker 1>we can't have this exploding some</v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare.</v>

732
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Let's work together and figure this shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

733
00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

734
00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:22.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult but not difficult.</v>

735
00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Ideological audiologically a plan to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come forward.</v>

736
00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.360
<v Speaker 1>It's so fascinating when you compare</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to South Korea,</v>

737
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:32.350
<v Speaker 1>which is thriving economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes some of the best electronics in</v>

738
00:30:32.351 --> 00:30:35.710
<v Speaker 1>the world or the best phones and</v>
<v Speaker 1>televisions and you know,</v>

739
00:30:35.711 --> 00:30:39.640
<v Speaker 1>and it's just amazing that they're right</v>
<v Speaker 1>next door to each other and there's such</v>

740
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:42.580
<v Speaker 1>a consensus internationally that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this place is evil.</v>

741
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:43.780
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

742
00:30:43.781 --> 00:30:45.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya where these other countries have</v>

743
00:30:45.221 --> 00:30:47.560
<v Speaker 1>their back and you're ran a rock and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this other stuff with us.</v>

744
00:30:47.561 --> 00:30:48.790
<v Speaker 1>More religious though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

745
00:30:48.791 --> 00:30:50.650
<v Speaker 1>And with this they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one has their back,</v>

746
00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:53.110
<v Speaker 1>like maybe some weird African countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have allies with,</v>

747
00:30:53.111 --> 00:30:54.640
<v Speaker 1>but everyone in that region is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

748
00:30:54.641 --> 00:30:57.010
<v Speaker 1>this shit's a nightmare and enough's</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

749
00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking hilarious.</v>

750
00:30:58.661 --> 00:31:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Whenever they try to show some display a</v>
<v Speaker 1>power and they have a launch of like</v>

751
00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:06.850
<v Speaker 1>some missile that shoots 13 feet up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the air and then explode.</v>

752
00:31:06.851 --> 00:31:08.410
<v Speaker 1>That could be intentional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>

753
00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.990
<v Speaker 1>So they can't back down ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

754
00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:14.530
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to back down without</v>
<v Speaker 1>backing down is you make a mistake.</v>

755
00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like you don't have the</v>

756
00:31:16.001 --> 00:31:17.320
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

757
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.240
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I would put my money.</v>

758
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.131
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

759
00:31:20.131 --> 00:31:22.480
<v Speaker 1>that's some weird fucking multilevel</v>
<v Speaker 1>chest.</v>

760
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.330
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been playing multilevel chest</v>

761
00:31:24.331 --> 00:31:25.380
<v Speaker 1>since the forties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have,</v>

762
00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:28.840
<v Speaker 1>but they're all about face about showing</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

763
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:31.870
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things about Korea</v>
<v Speaker 1>will all I know about a South Korea.</v>

764
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:37.080
<v Speaker 1>I know quite a bit about South Korean</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and the way I grew up learning</v>

765
00:31:38.471 --> 00:31:41.350
<v Speaker 1>and teaching taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was around a lot of Koreans and</v>

766
00:31:41.351 --> 00:31:44.890
<v Speaker 1>they're very much about honor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very much about hard work and</v>

767
00:31:44.891 --> 00:31:46.750
<v Speaker 1>they're very much about appearances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

768
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea of giving up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like showing a weakness like that</v>

769
00:31:51.311 --> 00:31:54.460
<v Speaker 1>intentionally seems pretty alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the choice is,</v>

770
00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:57.130
<v Speaker 1>are you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If trump says if you go forward with</v>

771
00:31:57.131 --> 00:31:58.810
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to attack you.</v>

772
00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:01.630
<v Speaker 1>So that's not on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So plan B isn't like,</v>

773
00:32:01.631 --> 00:32:03.910
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to give in plan b would be</v>

774
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.940
<v Speaker 1>to act like you're defying him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not actually defining it.</v>

775
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.220
<v Speaker 1>That sounds so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating though.</v>

776
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not disagreeing with their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

777
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:14.320
<v Speaker 1>that's where I would put my money</v>
<v Speaker 1>because think about it,</v>

778
00:32:14.321 --> 00:32:16.390
<v Speaker 1>if you are doing these tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be,</v>

779
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.570
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be testing it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly how many times,</v>

780
00:32:19.571 --> 00:32:20.710
<v Speaker 1>like in America you're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

781
00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess windows crashes,</v>

782
00:32:22.451 --> 00:32:24.010
<v Speaker 1>but people go through this over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>

783
00:32:24.011 --> 00:32:25.520
<v Speaker 1>especially when your life is at risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

784
00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:28.780
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to make damn sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be working before you</v>

785
00:32:28.781 --> 00:32:29.614
<v Speaker 1>announced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

786
00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:31.480
<v Speaker 1>April 14th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're having our big launch,</v>

787
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.100
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but aren't they developing this</v>

788
00:32:33.101 --> 00:32:36.100
<v Speaker 1>technology in a vacuum as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the rest of the world?</v>

789
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with United States,</v>

790
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States is,</v>

791
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.660
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have the internet.</v>

792
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.720
<v Speaker 3>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have some of the very best aerospace</v>

793
00:32:44.721 --> 00:32:48.710
<v Speaker 3>engineers in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most knowledgeable people in terms</v>

794
00:32:48.711 --> 00:32:52.280
<v Speaker 3>of rocketry and explosions and all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit like you're dealing with is</v>

795
00:32:52.281 --> 00:32:55.220
<v Speaker 3>fantastic database of human beings to</v>
<v Speaker 3>draw from,</v>

796
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:59.210
<v Speaker 3>but they're isolated like wouldn't it</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sense that their stuff kind of</v>

797
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:01.730
<v Speaker 3>sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is if it sucks,</v>

798
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:05.870
<v Speaker 3>they would do the test privately and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>some hidden place until they got the</v>

799
00:33:05.871 --> 00:33:07.940
<v Speaker 3>kinks out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they would publicly do it when</v>

800
00:33:07.941 --> 00:33:11.570
<v Speaker 3>they've got the kinks out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you publicly show your hand</v>

801
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.390
<v Speaker 3>unless you had a purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 3>While they probably don't have enough</v>

802
00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:17.020
<v Speaker 3>money to run nearly enough tests like</v>
<v Speaker 3>we.</v>

803
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.030
<v Speaker 3>We know that they have done some tests</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we've observed,</v>

804
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:21.950
<v Speaker 3>but remember there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was some concern.</v>

805
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.270
<v Speaker 3>They detonated a nuke.</v>

806
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:26.660
<v Speaker 3>You have nukes 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was concern that they had</v>

807
00:33:26.661 --> 00:33:28.770
<v Speaker 3>detonated run under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was underground.</v>

808
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a few years back.</v>

809
00:33:30.411 --> 00:33:33.050
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my point is we don't know,</v>

810
00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:36.800
<v Speaker 3>and this would be something that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be up their alley and it would be.</v>

811
00:33:36.801 --> 00:33:40.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand why they would</v>
<v Speaker 3>announce something unless they were sure</v>

812
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.470
<v Speaker 3>they could do it because that's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>about face.</v>

813
00:33:42.471 --> 00:33:42.980
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

814
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.500
<v Speaker 3>here's our big launch and then you turn</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the TV doesn't work.</v>

815
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.150
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never thought of that.</v>

816
00:33:47.151 --> 00:33:48.410
<v Speaker 3>You might be right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

817
00:33:48.411 --> 00:33:50.150
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating to think about it that</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

818
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.250
<v Speaker 3>Does anybody share your opinion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this a call?</v>

819
00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean really it's not.</v>

820
00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.480
<v Speaker 3>It's not like there's a huge community</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people who understand North Korea,</v>

821
00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:01.460
<v Speaker 3>but this is what people who have watched</v>
<v Speaker 3>the country do share is the consensus</v>

822
00:34:01.461 --> 00:34:03.470
<v Speaker 3>that you can't take shit at face value</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever with them.</v>

823
00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.300
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

824
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.820
<v Speaker 3>That's a really amazing sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>strategy.</v>

825
00:34:07.821 --> 00:34:12.110
<v Speaker 3>If that really is the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really very self aware.</v>

826
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll look at.</v>

827
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:14.330
<v Speaker 3>Look at La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two years ago,</v>

828
00:34:14.331 --> 00:34:16.010
<v Speaker 3>my buddy called me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a,</v>

829
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:19.430
<v Speaker 3>they had a photo they released if Kim</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jong Il and on his Mac book and behind</v>

830
00:34:19.431 --> 00:34:21.350
<v Speaker 3>him was a map of the US where the nukes</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to hit,</v>

831
00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:23.090
<v Speaker 3>including Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend calls me goes,</v>

832
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.620
<v Speaker 3>are they get a Nuke Austin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

833
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:26.540
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm looking Austin,</v>

834
00:34:26.541 --> 00:34:28.340
<v Speaker 3>why the fuck am I putting this on my</v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram?</v>

835
00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.010
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

836
00:34:31.011 --> 00:34:33.620
<v Speaker 3>And of course they didn't Nuke Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Austin,</v>

837
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:36.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe they know how many bullets</v>

838
00:34:36.111 --> 00:34:38.900
<v Speaker 3>are in Texas when they passed the last</v>
<v Speaker 3>place to invade.</v>

839
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:40.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they operate like this,</v>

840
00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:42.440
<v Speaker 3>like there's two types of bank robbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

841
00:34:42.441 --> 00:34:44.480
<v Speaker 3>There's the bank robber comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoots up the ceiling,</v>

842
00:34:44.481 --> 00:34:45.410
<v Speaker 3>gets diluted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets out.</v>

843
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Then there's the bank robber comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoots up everyone,</v>

844
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:50.330
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you deal with the first one when they</v>

845
00:34:50.331 --> 00:34:52.130
<v Speaker 3>were firing their missiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fragmented the ocean,</v>

846
00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.810
<v Speaker 3>they're not firing them into Tokyo or</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seoul.</v>

847
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.460
<v Speaker 3>That's telling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

848
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they don't want to get killed right</v>

849
00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.710
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to show that they have metal,</v>

850
00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:01.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they want to say,</v>

851
00:35:01.881 --> 00:35:04.370
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can launch a missile at Los Angeles,</v>

852
00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.310
<v Speaker 3>or I sold 10 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

853
00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.240
<v Speaker 3>you can't even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

854
00:35:08.241 --> 00:35:08.930
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about nukes?</v>

855
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:09.670
<v Speaker 3>What about nukes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

856
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.520
<v Speaker 3>that's on Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other day.</v>

857
00:35:11.521 --> 00:35:13.370
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really nuke smokes.</v>

858
00:35:13.371 --> 00:35:16.130
<v Speaker 3>You care about missiles hitting those</v>
<v Speaker 3>skyscrapers and soul.</v>

859
00:35:16.131 --> 00:35:17.570
<v Speaker 3>Can you even imagine what that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>look like?</v>

860
00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:19.880
<v Speaker 3>It would be like independence day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be insane.</v>

861
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.400
<v Speaker 3>And it's close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's extremely close.</v>

862
00:35:22.401 --> 00:35:24.230
<v Speaker 3>So the missiles would get there in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>matter of minutes,</v>

863
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.830
<v Speaker 3>if not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not even lying.</v>

864
00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:27.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

865
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:32.060
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about the theory</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been run back and forth pretty</v>

866
00:35:32.061 --> 00:35:34.790
<v Speaker 3>recently?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the United States sabotage those</v>

867
00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 3>same way they sabotage the Iranian?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That</v>

868
00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:39.530
<v Speaker 2>would be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be.</v>

869
00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sap knows.</v>

870
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sabotaged the Iranian nuclear</v>

871
00:35:46.741 --> 00:35:51.600
<v Speaker 2>program with viruses and they're saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it could perhaps have been the same</v>

872
00:35:51.601 --> 00:35:54.540
<v Speaker 2>case with North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they sabotage the missile program</v>

873
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:56.710
<v Speaker 2>with some sort of computer environment</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have.</v>

874
00:35:56.830 --> 00:36:00.570
<v Speaker 2>That also is very plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it be hacking or would it be</v>

875
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:05.600
<v Speaker 2>something along the lines of someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>clandestine selling some sort of,</v>

876
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:08.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology to them that turns out to be</v>

877
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:12.690
<v Speaker 2>technology with an embedded virus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My understanding was it was hacking</v>

878
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.920
<v Speaker 2>hacking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allegedly.</v>

879
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:14.813
<v Speaker 2>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

880
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:16.380
<v Speaker 2>But if they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

881
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I understand how they would</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

882
00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are on there.</v>

883
00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:22.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's their online of kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>

884
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there would be a way to get to it,</v>

885
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:29.130
<v Speaker 2>especially if China's helping us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

886
00:36:29.131 --> 00:36:31.950
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ins and outs of international</v>

887
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:35.460
<v Speaker 2>espionage and politics and sabotage and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that shit.</v>

888
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:40.490
<v Speaker 2>It is unbelievably fascinating to me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most people don't even have the</v>

889
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:46.640
<v Speaker 2>slightest understanding of how deep that</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit go and how hard people like in the</v>

890
00:36:47.911 --> 00:36:52.560
<v Speaker 2>CIA work and the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>embedded in these essentially terrorist</v>

891
00:36:52.561 --> 00:36:55.200
<v Speaker 2>organizations like this was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that came out about trump</v>

892
00:36:55.201 --> 00:37:00.201
<v Speaker 2>revealing to Russia that these laptops</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isis was planning on using laptops</v>

893
00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:05.760
<v Speaker 2>for bombs and in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gave them top secret information that</v>

894
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:09.500
<v Speaker 2>he felt he had the right to declassify</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

895
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:10.171
<v Speaker 2>Give it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

896
00:37:10.171 --> 00:37:13.230
<v Speaker 2>he claimed to have clients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people that have I that I've</v>

897
00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:15.990
<v Speaker 2>talked to that have an understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the intelligence</v>

898
00:37:15.991 --> 00:37:18.600
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say that in doing so,</v>

899
00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:22.920
<v Speaker 2>you compromise all the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked very hard to get to the position</v>

900
00:37:22.921 --> 00:37:27.921
<v Speaker 2>to find out that isis was doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now isis has to take an account of</v>

901
00:37:28.141 --> 00:37:31.110
<v Speaker 2>all the people and some sort of an audit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all the people that they're in</v>

902
00:37:31.111 --> 00:37:34.890
<v Speaker 2>contact with and then try to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck this got out and who,</v>

903
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:38.070
<v Speaker 2>who are the sketchy people or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>questionable people and then puts people</v>

904
00:37:38.071 --> 00:37:41.280
<v Speaker 2>in danger and people have to flee and</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently they had to.</v>

905
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.310
<v Speaker 2>When trump did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to alert the intelligence</v>

906
00:37:44.311 --> 00:37:47.940
<v Speaker 2>community like immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is one of the reasons why even</v>

907
00:37:47.941 --> 00:37:51.570
<v Speaker 2>though it seems benign to him on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>surface level because he's thinking</v>

908
00:37:51.571 --> 00:37:53.520
<v Speaker 2>about a million different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

909
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:56.460
<v Speaker 2>He's thinking about a million different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things all at once and his lack of</v>

910
00:37:56.461 --> 00:37:59.940
<v Speaker 2>understanding about the importance and</v>
<v Speaker 2>significance of top secret clearance</v>

911
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:01.580
<v Speaker 2>according to the people that have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

912
00:38:01.581 --> 00:38:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I've communicated with is why it's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous for him to just talk about</v>

913
00:38:06.331 --> 00:38:09.270
<v Speaker 2>this stuff with Russia will also this</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thing where people are like,</v>

914
00:38:09.271 --> 00:38:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares about Hillary's server?</v>

915
00:38:10.711 --> 00:38:12.660
<v Speaker 2>It's just like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the secretary of state.</v>

916
00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Are you equal kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got on there.</v>

917
00:38:14.731 --> 00:38:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Who the hell knows we have a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem in this country of being on</v>

918
00:38:17.191 --> 00:38:19.350
<v Speaker 2>teams and we have a real problem in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

919
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:23.010
<v Speaker 2>People that don't like trump thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hillary would have been a great</v>

920
00:38:23.011 --> 00:38:26.340
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real problem because I'm not a</v>

921
00:38:26.341 --> 00:38:27.600
<v Speaker 2>fan of either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

922
00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:29.610
<v Speaker 2>And I think you as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a human being,</v>

923
00:38:29.611 --> 00:38:32.820
<v Speaker 2>should expect more from someone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to run the free world,</v>

924
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where I should expect someone.</v>

925
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.440
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd expect someone who you can clearly</v>

926
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:42.460
<v Speaker 2>tell is going to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can tell that from either one of</v>

927
00:38:42.461 --> 00:38:45.370
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want someone who has principles and</v>

928
00:38:45.371 --> 00:38:47.410
<v Speaker 2>sticks with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell that from either one of</v>

929
00:38:47.411 --> 00:38:48.170
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

930
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:51.010
<v Speaker 2>it's not what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need something greater.</v>

931
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.340
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's a great article and</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherboard today,</v>

932
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:54.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

933
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:58.030
<v Speaker 2>it's essentially something that I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been saying for years that the United</v>

934
00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:01.940
<v Speaker 2>States is far too complicated to be run</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a president and that the idea is</v>

935
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.910
<v Speaker 2>antiquated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an idea that was created back</v>

936
00:39:03.911 --> 00:39:05.470
<v Speaker 2>when people came over here on boats.</v>

937
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had an article for the observer and</v>

938
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 2>article called the case for American</v>
<v Speaker 2>succession.</v>

939
00:39:09.611 --> 00:39:12.820
<v Speaker 2>And the point I made was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had two culture since the</v>

940
00:39:12.821 --> 00:39:16.270
<v Speaker 2>beginning and I agree with you</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely to have one guy running</v>

941
00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:18.210
<v Speaker 2>everything or one woman is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

942
00:39:18.211 --> 00:39:22.760
<v Speaker 2>what's thought to break stuff up when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>fired comey that woke a lot of people</v>

943
00:39:22.761 --> 00:39:23.141
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

944
00:39:23.141 --> 00:39:24.040
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just do that.</v>

945
00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:26.860
<v Speaker 2>You just fire the guy who's in charge of</v>
<v Speaker 2>investigating him.</v>

946
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck does that work?</v>

947
00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it was also because Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

948
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:30.970
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

949
00:39:30.971 --> 00:39:31.780
<v Speaker 2>He's a giant dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

950
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:32.390
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

951
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.540
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell him what's that evening that</v>

952
00:39:34.541 --> 00:39:35.410
<v Speaker 2>bothered him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tell you,</v>

953
00:39:35.411 --> 00:39:37.960
<v Speaker 2>telling me that trump doesn't like</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking up to someone no way.</v>

954
00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the guy was totally down for him and</v>

955
00:39:40.361 --> 00:39:42.340
<v Speaker 2>hugged him back and told him that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

956
00:39:42.341 --> 00:39:43.030
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about it.</v>

957
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Your boyfriend's physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can look it up saying that if clint,</v>

958
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:51.140
<v Speaker 2>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Comi was like totally on board at a</v>

959
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.680
<v Speaker 2>total trumpkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he came in and just acquiesce asked,</v>

960
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:56.800
<v Speaker 2>you don't think that he'd still be on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still beyond,</v>

961
00:39:56.801 --> 00:39:59.230
<v Speaker 2>but trump didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd make him be sitting when he walks</v>

962
00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:01.540
<v Speaker 2>in a room with some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a very petty person,</v>

963
00:40:01.541 --> 00:40:05.190
<v Speaker 2>which is what I admired about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to Sam Harris podcast</v>

964
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:08.530
<v Speaker 2>recently where they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking with two political</v>

965
00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:09.850
<v Speaker 2>experts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget their names,</v>

966
00:40:09.851 --> 00:40:14.851
<v Speaker 2>but two women who were talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>case for succession succession or excuse</v>

967
00:40:15.881 --> 00:40:16.271
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the k,</v>

968
00:40:16.271 --> 00:40:19.930
<v Speaker 2>the case for impeachment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were essentially saying that</v>

969
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:24.040
<v Speaker 2>his attention span is so short that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to give them visual aids and they</v>

970
00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:27.430
<v Speaker 2>have to put his name as many times as</v>
<v Speaker 2>they came in and memos because he</v>

971
00:40:27.431 --> 00:40:30.310
<v Speaker 2>searches for his name when he goes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>reads from Amazon.</v>

972
00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:32.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

973
00:40:32.201 --> 00:40:37.201
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's maybe some sneaky</v>
<v Speaker 2>way of getting under his skin to get him</v>

974
00:40:37.331 --> 00:40:41.260
<v Speaker 2>to go fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which like you're talking about</v>

975
00:40:41.261 --> 00:40:43.480
<v Speaker 2>multilevel chest with North Korea doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing.</v>

976
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.330
<v Speaker 2>I would feel like if that's the way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck with the guy,</v>

977
00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.540
<v Speaker 2>it's still leak shit like this out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say things like this,</v>

978
00:40:49.541 --> 00:40:52.900
<v Speaker 2>like he needs visual aids or he needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name research funny.</v>

979
00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.950
<v Speaker 2>So he could rather his name mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple times and these memos.</v>

980
00:40:55.951 --> 00:40:57.110
<v Speaker 2>So he looks for his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

981
00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.150
<v Speaker 2>there's me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

982
00:40:58.210 --> 00:40:58.591
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

983
00:40:58.591 --> 00:41:03.490
<v Speaker 2>I think people are so willing to believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst about people that they hate,</v>

984
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:06.250
<v Speaker 2>that it gets cartoonish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember during the two thousands</v>

985
00:41:06.251 --> 00:41:09.460
<v Speaker 2>where some journalists said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think George w dot Bush can read</v>

986
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:13.450
<v Speaker 2>me like a healthy happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like he went to Harvard and</v>

987
00:41:13.451 --> 00:41:14.320
<v Speaker 2>Yale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

988
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate trump.</v>

989
00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people think that it's a,</v>

990
00:41:19.551 --> 00:41:21.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing to hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate him as president.</v>

991
00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate him as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

992
00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate him.</v>

993
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this country a great service by</v>

994
00:41:28.211 --> 00:41:32.770
<v Speaker 2>making them suspicious of our democratic</v>
<v Speaker 2>process that I've been making this</v>

995
00:41:32.771 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 2>argument for a couple of years on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on</v>

996
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.520
<v Speaker 3>on many different shows that it's very</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy for people to be like,</v>

997
00:41:37.521 --> 00:41:40.850
<v Speaker 3>if this is the outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to double check that this is</v>

998
00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:43.400
<v Speaker 3>the system you love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the monkey wrench in the gears of</v>

999
00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:44.350
<v Speaker 3>the model t.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1000
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.820
<v Speaker 3>and we don't need a model t anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Tesla,</v>

1001
00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.680
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is 2017,</v>

1002
00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:52.760
<v Speaker 3>something far more advanced and what we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't just keep patching up the model to</v>

1003
00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.020
<v Speaker 3>its current year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:57.800
<v Speaker 3>We don't want windows 95 with all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>upgrades for 2017.</v>

1005
00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:01.940
<v Speaker 3>You get the fuck Outta here right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety five to have politics divided</v>

1006
00:42:01.941 --> 00:42:05.030
<v Speaker 3>geographically is a very outdated way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at the.</v>

1007
00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:07.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also to have representative</v>

1008
00:42:07.011 --> 00:42:09.470
<v Speaker 3>governments very outdated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't need someone to represent us</v>

1009
00:42:09.471 --> 00:42:11.690
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can communicate instantaneously.</v>

1010
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:13.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone has a communication device</v>

1011
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:15.250
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone except for.</v>

1012
00:42:15.251 --> 00:42:18.650
<v Speaker 3>You're a crazy fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't even use a phone anymore,</v>

1013
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:23.300
<v Speaker 3>but everyone else is using modern cell</v>
<v Speaker 3>phones where you could tweet for or you</v>

1014
00:42:23.301 --> 00:42:25.490
<v Speaker 3>could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could vote from anywhere in the</v>

1015
00:42:25.491 --> 00:42:26.324
<v Speaker 3>world essentially.</v>

1016
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:27.800
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it should be.</v>

1017
00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.050
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should have technology and we should</v>

1018
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:32.120
<v Speaker 3>have a government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we should have rather a</v>

1019
00:42:32.121 --> 00:42:35.750
<v Speaker 3>government that recognizes the current</v>
<v Speaker 3>technology and utilize it to get the</v>

1020
00:42:35.751 --> 00:42:37.510
<v Speaker 3>voice of the people out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1021
00:42:37.511 --> 00:42:39.380
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the technology is what's actually making</v>

1022
00:42:39.381 --> 00:42:43.600
<v Speaker 3>the government put in its place and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going at an increasingly fast rates and</v>

1023
00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:47.630
<v Speaker 3>integrative and it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm fascinated by is all these</v>

1024
00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:48.920
<v Speaker 3>trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1025
00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm a professional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm writing a book about this on trolls</v>

1026
00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.130
<v Speaker 3>and the new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1027
00:42:52.131 --> 00:42:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the new.</v>

1028
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just the new,</v>

1029
00:42:54.321 --> 00:42:56.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can call them the new right,</v>

1030
00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.430
<v Speaker 3>but they could easily be left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm fascinated by is these people</v>

1031
00:43:01.431 --> 00:43:05.300
<v Speaker 3>that they.</v>

1045
00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:27.620
<v Speaker 3>Turns out to be a mass murderer and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't do it.</v>

1046
00:43:27.621 --> 00:43:28.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not getting a shout out,</v>

1047
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:31.790
<v Speaker 3>but he's a whole group as a whole group</v>

<v Speaker 3>Boys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not shouting you out.</v>

1052
00:43:36.981 --> 00:43:39.350
<v Speaker 3>If you have a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There shouldn't be any leaders.</v>

1053
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:40.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we should have leaders</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1054
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:43.280
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's 350 million people in</v>

1055
00:43:43.281 --> 00:43:46.580
<v Speaker 3>this country and the idea of leaders is</v>
<v Speaker 3>some old school alpha chimp.</v>

1056
00:43:46.581 --> 00:43:49.640
<v Speaker 3>Bullshit to say right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the very first sentence in my</v>

1057
00:43:49.641 --> 00:43:51.040
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1058
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.060
<v Speaker 3>When the world leader or leadership</v>
<v Speaker 3>returns to currently.</v>

1059
00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1060
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:57.371
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>

1061
00:43:57.371 --> 00:44:02.371
<v Speaker 3>You're essentially saying exactly that</v>
<v Speaker 3>relapse into barbarism.</v>

1062
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:05.060
<v Speaker 3>That's a great word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1063
00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:07.400
<v Speaker 3>Barbarism is a great word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1064
00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:10.230
<v Speaker 3>Mussolini was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll do it.</v>

1065
00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the leader and this was patterson</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1068
00:44:16.101 --> 00:44:17.810

1069
00:44:17.811 --> 00:44:20.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's escalated and compounded since then</v>

1070
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.980
<v Speaker 3>because society has gotten more</v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated.</v>

1071
00:44:21.981 --> 00:44:25.100
<v Speaker 3>We've gotten more diverse ideologically</v>
<v Speaker 3>at remember in the eighties where every</v>

1072
00:44:25.101 --> 00:44:28.670
<v Speaker 3>hack comedian would make a joke about</v>
<v Speaker 3>how this diet coke and caffeine free</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was like a special promotion.</v>

1130
00:46:56.790 --> 00:47:00.900
<v Speaker 3>So he made a Taco out of Bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shell was baking like a week and he</v>

1131
00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:04.170

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1138
00:47:19.561 --> 00:47:22.560
<v Speaker 3>We got way off track here yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what we're saying essentially before</v>

1139
00:47:22.561 --> 00:47:27.561
<v Speaker 3>we got onto this crazy rant is that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>need an updated form of government,</v>

1140
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:29.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1142
00:47:32.981 --> 00:47:34.840
<v Speaker 3>the other day I think is really</v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

1143
00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.540
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about members of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Congress,</v>

1144
00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:39.670
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was saying,</v>

1145
00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:43.300
<v Speaker 3>look at all these people in government</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what are their occupations?</v>

1146
00:47:43.301 --> 00:47:44.260
<v Speaker 3>Lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyer,</v>

1147
00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:44.981
<v Speaker 3>lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyer.</v>

1148
00:47:44.981 --> 00:47:47.320
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the engineers were.</v>

1149
00:47:47.321 --> 00:47:49.570
<v Speaker 3>The scientists were the math petition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

1150
00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.570
<v Speaker 3>that's a dangerous road because the rest</v>
<v Speaker 3>of life communists said there were</v>

1151
00:47:52.571 --> 00:47:55.450
<v Speaker 3>scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific socialism and those engineers</v>

1152
00:47:55.451 --> 00:47:59.500
<v Speaker 3>are the ones who regard human beings as</v>
<v Speaker 3>factors to be thrown into equation and</v>

1153
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:00.640
<v Speaker 3>that's when you get the meat grinder.</v>

1154
00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.690
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you.</v>

1155
00:48:01.691 --> 00:48:03.340
<v Speaker 3>St Sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Philip Meat Grinders.</v>

1156
00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:05.620
<v Speaker 3>I was saying when scientists try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>become politicians,</v>

1157
00:48:05.621 --> 00:48:07.360
<v Speaker 3>they start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop looking at human beings as human</v>

1158
00:48:07.361 --> 00:48:09.670
<v Speaker 3>beings and start looking at them as</v>
<v Speaker 3>factors in the machine.</v>

1159
00:48:09.671 --> 00:48:10.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very sick.</v>

1160
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:13.240
<v Speaker 3>Have you been paying attention to what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on with Bill Nye?</v>

1161
00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:17.120
<v Speaker 3>Scientists are all going after bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neither Mr Guy the Weimer.</v>

1162
00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:17.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's.</v>

1163
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:19.780
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are Germany is right before Hitler</v>

1164
00:48:19.781 --> 00:48:23.770
<v Speaker 3>was El decadent and like everyone's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely loose and cultural liberal</v>

1165
00:48:23.771 --> 00:48:26.020
<v Speaker 3>and he's having these dancers about</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about their vagina.</v>

1166
00:48:26.021 --> 00:48:27.950
<v Speaker 3>It's why motor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was what was ridiculous.</v>

1167
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:29.050
<v Speaker 3>Not even a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1168
00:48:29.051 --> 00:48:30.610
<v Speaker 3>he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1169
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:33.340
<v Speaker 3>it tastes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a con man.</v>

1170
00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:34.720
<v Speaker 3>Isn't he an engineer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1171
00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:38.370
<v Speaker 3>but he's not a climatologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not a scientist and he's also</v>

1172
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.620
<v Speaker 3>changing his tune.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was A.</v>

1173
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Steven crowder did a bit about it where</v>
<v Speaker 3>he showed the original show that he did</v>

1174
00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:50.620
<v Speaker 3>many years ago where they talked about</v>
<v Speaker 3>how gender is from chromosomes,</v>

1175
00:48:50.621 --> 00:48:53.650
<v Speaker 3>there's double x,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is men and or women in x,</v>

1176
00:48:53.651 --> 00:48:56.840
<v Speaker 3>y,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was men and they are establishing</v>

1177
00:48:56.841 --> 00:48:58.100
<v Speaker 3>like what causes your gender?</v>

1178
00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.850
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now he's completely gone off of that</v>

1179
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:06.150
<v Speaker 3>and his new thing had this woman who</v>
<v Speaker 3>belonged in some fucking Venice theater</v>

1180
00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:11.170
<v Speaker 3>group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like barking out at a poetry slam,</v>

1181
00:49:11.171 --> 00:49:16.171
<v Speaker 3>some unbelievably God awful song and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this motherfucker put it on Netflix and</v>

1182
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.300
<v Speaker 3>a science show about gender and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretended to be like a,</v>

1183
00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:23.020
<v Speaker 3>a Dj in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is so not science,</v>

1184
00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not scientific consulting.</v>

1185
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:28.360
<v Speaker 3>Progressivism is just Christianity</v>
<v Speaker 3>without the mythology.</v>

1186
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:30.790
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very much this kind of Christian</v>

1187
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.370
<v Speaker 3>ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>radical progressive as correct.</v>

1188
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Which evangelical progressive is</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically.</v>

1189
00:49:35.351 --> 00:49:36.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean someone who like believes</v>
<v Speaker 3>in welfare.</v>

1190
00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:38.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's this ideology that he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fallen into.</v>

1191
00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:42.070
<v Speaker 3>What's a complete religion which has</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely divorced from reality and</v>

1192
00:49:42.071 --> 00:49:44.440
<v Speaker 3>stuff like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's full left wing.</v>

1193
00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's.</v>

1194
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.100
<v Speaker 3>There's great ideas and being</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive,</v>

1195
00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.800
<v Speaker 3>there's some amazing ideas in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>inclusiveness,</v>

1196
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:55.090
<v Speaker 3>in terms of live and let live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>letting people be whoever they want,</v>

1197
00:49:55.091 --> 00:49:58.600
<v Speaker 3>express yourselves in any way that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can see fit as long as it's not hurting</v>

1198
00:49:58.601 --> 00:50:00.050
<v Speaker 3>others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that stuff is aggressively</v>

1199
00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:00.880
<v Speaker 3>propaganda.</v>

1200
00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.650
<v Speaker 3>It's meant to be propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

1201
00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:03.820
<v Speaker 3>His show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>His show is.</v>

1202
00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:08.290
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what he's doing is licking his</v>

1203
00:50:08.291 --> 00:50:10.210
<v Speaker 3>finger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finding out which way the wind is</v>

1204
00:50:10.211 --> 00:50:12.250
<v Speaker 3>blowing and giving into those people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1205
00:50:12.251 --> 00:50:14.950
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a true believer because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be a true believer to put</v>

1206
00:50:14.951 --> 00:50:17.290
<v Speaker 3>something like that out under your name</v>
<v Speaker 3>and think this is a good idea.</v>

1207
00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:19.510
<v Speaker 3>It's just a quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like Christian rock.</v>

1208
00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:22.180
<v Speaker 3>I think it's debatable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I honestly think that these people,</v>

1209
00:50:22.181 --> 00:50:25.880
<v Speaker 3>especially a guy like him who was</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing life in the public eye</v>

1210
00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:27.250
<v Speaker 3>fairly late in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1211
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.450
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

1212
00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.550
<v Speaker 3>when he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to people that are really</v>

1213
00:50:31.551 --> 00:50:36.551
<v Speaker 3>enthusiastic about science and really</v>
<v Speaker 3>enthusiastic about these ideas that he's</v>

1214
00:50:36.831 --> 00:50:39.860
<v Speaker 3>trying to push on the show other than</v>
<v Speaker 3>this gender thing you're dealing with,</v>

1215
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:42.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great majority of them are liberal</v>

1216
00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:47.210
<v Speaker 3>white majority and I'm sure he</v>
<v Speaker 3>encounters a tremendous amount of</v>

1217
00:50:47.211 --> 00:50:48.830
<v Speaker 3>pressure to be inclusive.</v>

1218
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:53.890
<v Speaker 3>And gender is the hot topic when it</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to like weird science as it were.</v>

1219
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:57.520
<v Speaker 3>Like trying to figure out like how much</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this is what people feel.</v>

1220
00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:00.620
<v Speaker 3>How much of this can be explained in</v>
<v Speaker 3>genetics?</v>

1221
00:51:00.621 --> 00:51:03.140
<v Speaker 3>How much of this can be explained with</v>
<v Speaker 3>sociology,</v>

1222
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:05.330
<v Speaker 3>how much of it is nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of it is nurture,</v>

1223
00:51:05.331 --> 00:51:08.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very complex stew of human beings</v>

1224
00:51:08.121 --> 00:51:10.790
<v Speaker 3>and we know for a fact that people very</v>
<v Speaker 3>broadly,</v>

1225
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:11.400
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a,</v>

1226
00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:15.530
<v Speaker 3>there's a wide spectrum of human</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior and likes and needs and</v>

1227
00:51:15.531 --> 00:51:19.840
<v Speaker 3>feelings and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all sorts of weird dysmorphia is</v>

1228
00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.280
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know why people behave the way</v>

1229
00:51:22.281 --> 00:51:25.340
<v Speaker 3>they behave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for him to like boil it down to like</v>

1230
00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:27.920
<v Speaker 3>one of the shittiest rap songs the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>has ever known.</v>

1231
00:51:27.921 --> 00:51:29.570
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an insult.</v>

1232
00:51:29.571 --> 00:51:33.320
<v Speaker 3>But I think that's my point is that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think you have to kind of drank the</v>

1233
00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:35.570
<v Speaker 3>Koolaid to be putting this out as your</v>
<v Speaker 3>product.</v>

1234
00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:36.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1235
00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.540
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm less cynical than you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1236
00:51:38.541 --> 00:51:41.060
<v Speaker 3>That could be it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like he's had been influenced by</v>

1237
00:51:41.061 --> 00:51:41.780
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1238
00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:46.780
<v Speaker 3>I think the people that are super</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive are far more likely to push</v>

1239
00:51:46.791 --> 00:51:51.791
<v Speaker 3>these ideas in a very enthusiastic way</v>
<v Speaker 3>than people who are more conservative in</v>

1240
00:51:52.881 --> 00:51:54.560
<v Speaker 3>these matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to even approach them</v>

1241
00:51:54.561 --> 00:51:55.394
<v Speaker 3>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1242
00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:58.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I feel like he's just been influenced</v>

1243
00:51:58.101 --> 00:52:01.580
<v Speaker 3>by the influencers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well certainly is getting rewarded for</v>

1244
00:52:01.581 --> 00:52:03.260
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once you get rewarded for something,</v>

1245
00:52:03.261 --> 00:52:05.180
<v Speaker 3>your brain gets a feedback loop and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to.</v>

1246
00:52:05.181 --> 00:52:06.890
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of self validating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that could be it.</v>

1247
00:52:06.891 --> 00:52:07.850
<v Speaker 3>I can't speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the,</v>

1248
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:09.590
<v Speaker 3>here's the challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always have two people who always</v>

1249
00:52:09.591 --> 00:52:12.860
<v Speaker 3>talked about climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can't name two types of clouds</v>

1250
00:52:12.861 --> 00:52:15.080
<v Speaker 3>and what they look like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know enough about science and</v>

1251
00:52:15.081 --> 00:52:19.190
<v Speaker 3>climate to open your mouth and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>him and he's probably an exception.</v>

1252
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:21.890
<v Speaker 3>He probably knows about clouds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying the average person who</v>

1253
00:52:21.891 --> 00:52:23.810
<v Speaker 3>reads the New Yorker and they will tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1254
00:52:23.811 --> 00:52:25.550
<v Speaker 3>every scientist agrees that climate</v>
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>

1255
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:28.640
<v Speaker 3>You don't know the names of one</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientist who advised on climate change.</v>

1256
00:52:28.641 --> 00:52:30.140
<v Speaker 3>So shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a mantra.</v>

1257
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:31.910
<v Speaker 3>It's a mantra that people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1258
00:52:31.911 --> 00:52:32.421
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1259
00:52:32.421 --> 00:52:32.811
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1260
00:52:32.811 --> 00:52:34.370
<v Speaker 3>the scientists degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go for it.</v>

1261
00:52:34.371 --> 00:52:36.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not disagreeing with it at all,</v>

1262
00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:38.150
<v Speaker 3>but I am agreeing with what you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

1263
00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:41.300
<v Speaker 3>I totally disagree with it because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>site with climate change,</v>

1264
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:42.373
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this,</v>

1265
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:43.343
<v Speaker 3>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1266
00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:47.630
<v Speaker 3>perception of climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if we had immediate or coming</v>

1267
00:52:47.631 --> 00:52:49.760
<v Speaker 3>toward the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is going to destroy a life.</v>

1268
00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:52.370
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to be sitting here</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about North Korea.</v>

1269
00:52:52.371 --> 00:52:53.181
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1270
00:52:53.181 --> 00:52:54.770
<v Speaker 3>what about the media?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or are they doing something with this</v>

1271
00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:59.150
<v Speaker 3>fucking media or the climate change</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposedly is going to decimate all</v>

1272
00:52:59.151 --> 00:53:00.590
<v Speaker 3>civilization within a hundred years.</v>

1273
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:03.660
<v Speaker 3>Why are we talking about healthcare?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are we talking about China and trump</v>

1274
00:53:03.661 --> 00:53:05.600
<v Speaker 3>spelling and his name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1275
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:08.420
<v Speaker 3>All you're going to be talking about is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government's going to shut down</v>

1276
00:53:08.421 --> 00:53:11.750
<v Speaker 3>until we have an answer to this and</v>
<v Speaker 3>every politician who has children and</v>

1277
00:53:11.751 --> 00:53:14.420
<v Speaker 3>grandchildren is going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we gotta fucking get together and solve</v>

1278
00:53:14.421 --> 00:53:17.660
<v Speaker 3>this problem and the fact that this</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't happening is telling me that</v>

1279
00:53:17.661 --> 00:53:19.400
<v Speaker 3>there's more to the story than we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>being led to believe.</v>

1280
00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:21.620
<v Speaker 3>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the fact that we're talking</v>

1281
00:53:21.621 --> 00:53:23.330
<v Speaker 3>about other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If this is really this imminent</v>

1282
00:53:23.331 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 3>existential crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are we talking</v>

1283
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:30.300
<v Speaker 1>about anything else ever because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>imminent in terms of maybe 50 years that</v>

1284
00:53:30.310 --> 00:53:33.960
<v Speaker 1>people are 49,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how am I gonna I'm not even going to be</v>

1285
00:53:33.961 --> 00:53:36.480
<v Speaker 1>here in 50 years was fuck you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say thank you to the media or is it</v>

1286
00:53:36.481 --> 00:53:39.480
<v Speaker 1>gonna hit America and the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 50 years we wouldn't be doing</v>

1287
00:53:39.481 --> 00:53:41.310
<v Speaker 1>everything possible immediately to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1288
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I think there are plenty of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would just do coke and fly jets.</v>

1289
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:51.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm not necessarily sure they test all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their energy to save people that not</v>

1290
00:53:51.031 --> 00:53:52.710
<v Speaker 1>even gonna be around to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1291
00:53:52.711 --> 00:53:56.190
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's certainly 90 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people in Congress,</v>

1292
00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:58.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of people in industry care</v>

1293
00:53:58.381 --> 00:54:01.530
<v Speaker 1>enough about their children that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the only issue ever.</v>

1294
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they felt like it was absolutely</v>

1295
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:05.460
<v Speaker 1>missing and eminent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they do.</v>

1296
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.260
<v Speaker 1>I feel like yours is so far away.</v>

1297
00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:09.840
<v Speaker 1>You can't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's true.</v>

1298
00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:11.490
<v Speaker 1>I think for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you get older,</v>

1299
00:54:11.491 --> 00:54:13.140
<v Speaker 1>when you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking longterm.</v>

1300
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Why is trump backed away?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He accent because he's trump is one data</v>

1301
00:54:16.651 --> 00:54:18.420
<v Speaker 1>point and he's a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1302
00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:21.480
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of those lunatics with</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of resources that</v>

1303
00:54:21.481 --> 00:54:24.750
<v Speaker 1>aren't thinking about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's rolling back the EPA regulations.</v>

1304
00:54:24.751 --> 00:54:28.710
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to fucking frack everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he's doing is he's like,</v>

1305
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:30.950
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy who was doing coke and</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying the jet wire,</v>

1306
00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:33.940
<v Speaker 1>but look how much opposition there is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1307
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the point is,</v>

1308
00:54:35.221 --> 00:54:37.070
<v Speaker 1>if this was a real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't be opposition.</v>

1309
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:39.060
<v Speaker 1>It would be complete unanimous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unanimity,</v>

1310
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:42.540
<v Speaker 1>well there's a lot of opposition because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is air quotes the one percent,</v>

1311
00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:45.510
<v Speaker 1>which means 99 percent are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to the behavior of this one</v>

1312
00:54:45.511 --> 00:54:48.720
<v Speaker 1>person who's got billions of dollars and</v>
<v Speaker 1>also has the power to do all this crazy</v>

1313
00:54:48.721 --> 00:54:53.040
<v Speaker 1>shit like roll back the EPA regulations</v>
<v Speaker 1>like somehow or another this fucking</v>

1314
00:54:53.041 --> 00:54:57.720
<v Speaker 1>lunatic got into control of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Environmental Protection Agency</v>

1315
00:54:57.721 --> 00:54:58.800
<v Speaker 1>regulations.</v>

1316
00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:03.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's pretty fucking bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why this guy is not doing</v>

1317
00:55:03.511 --> 00:55:04.230
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

1318
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:06.570
<v Speaker 1>He is the radical thing that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about.</v>

1319
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:10.830
<v Speaker 1>But as you said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a good thing and that he's</v>

1320
00:55:10.831 --> 00:55:15.540
<v Speaker 1>exposing how bizarrely flawed the system</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we are trying to patch up window</v>

1321
00:55:15.541 --> 00:55:16.740
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>76,</v>

1322
00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:18.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what we're doing.</v>

1323
00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Seventy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>89,</v>

1324
00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:19.861
<v Speaker 1>70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>76.</v>

1325
00:55:19.861 --> 00:55:21.930
<v Speaker 1>We had the artists have federation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>17.</v>

1326
00:55:21.931 --> 00:55:23.560
<v Speaker 1>80 nine was the formation of the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

1327
00:55:23.561 --> 00:55:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Does the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we always celebrate spirit of 76?</v>

1328
00:55:26.191 --> 00:55:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the American war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were doing independent station.</v>

1329
00:55:29.161 --> 00:55:29.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their commission.</v>

1330
00:55:29.971 --> 00:55:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as I'm concerned,</v>

1331
00:55:31.051 --> 00:55:32.130
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when it starts.</v>

1332
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:34.330
<v Speaker 1>80 nine is when the United States was</v>
<v Speaker 1>officially found.</v>

1333
00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Was was the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1334
00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:37.710
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the constitution was illegal,</v>

1335
00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:38.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went in,</v>

1336
00:55:38.691 --> 00:55:41.010
<v Speaker 1>in the secret couple of people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about the founding fathers.</v>

1337
00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:43.560
<v Speaker 1>They went into Philadelphia secretly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

1338
00:55:43.561 --> 00:55:45.330
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to throw out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at confederation.</v>

1339
00:55:45.331 --> 00:55:46.590
<v Speaker 1>They look at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go with throwing the shit in the</v>

1340
00:55:46.591 --> 00:55:46.981
<v Speaker 1>garbage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1341
00:55:46.981 --> 00:55:47.281
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1342
00:55:47.281 --> 00:55:49.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sworn to secrecy,</v>

1343
00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:53.010
<v Speaker 1>which they did not have the power to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther went out and told everyone</v>

1344
00:55:53.011 --> 00:55:53.321
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1345
00:55:53.321 --> 00:55:54.570
<v Speaker 1>this is a coo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was.</v>

1346
00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:57.720
<v Speaker 1>It was illegal and everyone's still</v>
<v Speaker 1>champions them like there,</v>

1347
00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:58.950
<v Speaker 1>this was all this great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great thing.</v>

1348
00:55:58.951 --> 00:56:01.350
<v Speaker 1>This was a complete crew and all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that's a bad thing,</v>

1349
00:56:01.351 --> 00:56:04.590
<v Speaker 1>but it was a cool in terms of like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who was in control back then?</v>

1350
00:56:04.591 --> 00:56:05.424
<v Speaker 1>You mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>England?</v>

1351
00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Between England and the constitution</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the articles of confederation.</v>

1352
00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:14.010
<v Speaker 1>So the founding fathers in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>convention had the ability legally to</v>

1353
00:56:14.011 --> 00:56:16.860
<v Speaker 1>edit the articles of confederation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that they were like,</v>

1354
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:17.611
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this thing.</v>

1355
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:21.270
<v Speaker 1>We were totally throwing out the window</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite our mandate and and we're</v>

1356
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:23.070
<v Speaker 1>supporting each other to secrecy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

1357
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.430
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1358
00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:25.593
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what we need.</v>

1359
00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:27.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need that today.</v>

1360
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:31.090
<v Speaker 3>I need someone to fucking go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is ridiculous.</v>

1361
00:56:31.091 --> 00:56:33.910
<v Speaker 3>We're going to throw this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was the big percentage of</v>

1362
00:56:33.911 --> 00:56:35.500
<v Speaker 3>the trump vote was this shit's</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>

1363
00:56:35.501 --> 00:56:36.460
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>

1364
00:56:36.461 --> 00:56:38.520
<v Speaker 3>But now it's even more ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is weird.</v>

1365
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:39.850
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1366
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:43.870
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people who were into the idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>that America is going to look after</v>

1367
00:56:43.871 --> 00:56:47.440
<v Speaker 3>America and that we're all this foreign</v>
<v Speaker 3>interventionalism,</v>

1368
00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:51.130
<v Speaker 3>which is interrupting our lives and</v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming a huge problem.</v>

1369
00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:53.380
<v Speaker 3>And then what does he do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bomb Syria,</v>

1370
00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:55.720
<v Speaker 3>drops them all APP bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It starts.</v>

1371
00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:59.590
<v Speaker 3>He's over in Saudi Arabia right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>holding onto a big glowing ball with</v>

1372
00:56:59.591 --> 00:57:04.591
<v Speaker 3>some dude is dressed like a wizard about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia and the Moab.</v>

1373
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.390
<v Speaker 3>Who'd you hear it from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Jim Norton.</v>

1374
00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Now I don't remember who I want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones for comedic purposes.</v>

1375
00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:15.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those were two moves to show North Korea</v>

1376
00:57:15.161 --> 00:57:18.670
<v Speaker 3>that he's not joking because the Syria</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing went against everything.</v>

1377
00:57:18.671 --> 00:57:19.900
<v Speaker 3>He was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole campaign,</v>

1378
00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:22.510
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the fuck that come from,</v>

1379
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:25.360
<v Speaker 3>and then the next week they're all</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying we're not messing around with</v>

1380
00:57:25.361 --> 00:57:26.800
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Korea at the time for talk is</v>

1381
00:57:26.801 --> 00:57:28.270
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's one theory.</v>

1382
00:57:28.271 --> 00:57:32.080
<v Speaker 3>I heard that the moab bomb was just to</v>
<v Speaker 3>show that they're capable of dropping</v>

1383
00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:35.440
<v Speaker 3>that and that they're willing to drop it</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped in the middle of nowhere.</v>

1384
00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:37.490
<v Speaker 3>I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to show,</v>

1385
00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:40.800
<v Speaker 3>do a show of force when you just throw</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in Afghanistan rather than in</v>

1386
00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:41.670
<v Speaker 3>Pyongyang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1387
00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.730
<v Speaker 3>That is the move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

1388
00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:46.870
<v Speaker 3>It's so fascinating to me that we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>nukes and we'd like to ask too much.</v>

1389
00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.350
<v Speaker 3>We're just get drop the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 3>conventional bond known to man won't</v>

1390
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:54.250
<v Speaker 3>drop any nukes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's fine.</v>

1391
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:54.610
<v Speaker 3>We're cool.</v>

1392
00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:55.301
<v Speaker 3>We're cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're cool.</v>

1393
00:57:55.301 --> 00:57:57.820
<v Speaker 3>We're cool with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if he just decided that would be</v>

1394
00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:02.080
<v Speaker 3>really fucked up if he just decided to</v>
<v Speaker 3>drop a nuke on isis.</v>

1395
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:04.730
<v Speaker 3>If he knew that there was this place</v>
<v Speaker 3>where Isis is,</v>

1396
00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:08.280
<v Speaker 3>isis is 50,000 of 'em all concentrated</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this one area</v>

1397
00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:14.890
<v Speaker 3>and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just saw this fucking mushroom cloud</v>

1398
00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:18.250
<v Speaker 3>like that one mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's this classic ones from</v>

1399
00:58:18.251 --> 00:58:21.440
<v Speaker 3>the 19 fifties when they did those</v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear autodesk,</v>

1400
00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:24.810
<v Speaker 3>but if we saw one of those in the news</v>
<v Speaker 3>over and full color.</v>

1401
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:26.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1402
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:29.800
<v Speaker 3>From every angle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have the camera phones.</v>

1403
00:58:30.130 --> 00:58:32.290
<v Speaker 3>People from the space station filming</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking.</v>

1404
00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:33.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could probably see that from space.</v>

1405
00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:35.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1406
00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:36.130
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1407
00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:38.140
<v Speaker 3>And you can see the wall of China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see that.</v>

1408
00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.410
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a myth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

1409
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:40.050
<v Speaker 3>Think it isn't matter.</v>

1410
00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:43.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately I think you can see it</v>

1411
00:58:43.451 --> 00:58:44.720
<v Speaker 3>from certain satellites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1412
00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:48.010
<v Speaker 3>You can't see a different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like how high do you get up to 400</v>

1413
00:58:48.011 --> 00:58:50.710
<v Speaker 3>miles probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not like the Hemi v eight.</v>

1414
00:58:50.711 --> 00:58:52.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 22,000 miles away.</v>

1415
00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:54.850
<v Speaker 3>Detail about that one now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1416
00:58:54.851 --> 00:58:58.510
<v Speaker 3>he did it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did a c space that either from a jet.</v>

1417
00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:02.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder like what it would take for</v>

1418
00:59:02.921 --> 00:59:06.760
<v Speaker 3>trump to want to drop a nuke in like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>select location because I feel like</v>

1419
00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:10.000
<v Speaker 3>there's ever a president that'd be</v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to drop a nuke in the right</v>

1420
00:59:10.001 --> 00:59:11.440
<v Speaker 3>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be the guy.</v>

1421
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:12.940
<v Speaker 3>You don't think they put a bullet in him</v>
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>

1422
00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:18.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't see enough resistance to him</v>
<v Speaker 3>currently.</v>

1423
00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:21.100
<v Speaker 3>You don't know who's around him though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The secret service or if he's going to</v>

1424
00:59:21.101 --> 00:59:23.330
<v Speaker 3>nuke Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see them being like executive</v>

1425
00:59:23.331 --> 00:59:24.680
<v Speaker 3>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm shooting this guy.</v>

1426
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:26.420
<v Speaker 3>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be the end of their life</v>

1427
00:59:26.421 --> 00:59:28.640
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them not necessarily.</v>

1428
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:31.070
<v Speaker 3>It was someone shot at the president</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was about to drop a nuke</v>

1429
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:32.900
<v Speaker 3>guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You someone will shoot the guy who shot</v>

1430
00:59:32.901 --> 00:59:34.000
<v Speaker 3>the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1431
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.820
<v Speaker 3>unless there's some kind of protocol in</v>
<v Speaker 3>place that if this guy goes completely</v>

1432
00:59:37.821 --> 00:59:38.990
<v Speaker 3>nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we do then?</v>

1433
00:59:39.970 --> 00:59:41.220
<v Speaker 3>You know what's really fucked me up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

1434
00:59:41.221 --> 00:59:43.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm house of cards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1435
00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:46.100
<v Speaker 3>I watched that show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same thing from a comedic</v>

1436
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.370
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1437
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:49.010
<v Speaker 3>the new season's coming out like next</v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

1438
00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a masterpiece.</v>

1439
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:51.830
<v Speaker 3>Just finished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

1440
00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:56.860
<v Speaker 3>me and the missus binge watched the</v>
<v Speaker 3>entire series and three fourths,</v>

1441
00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.093
<v Speaker 3>four seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1442
00:59:58.410 --> 00:59:59.930
<v Speaker 3>The course of a couple months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

1443
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.420
<v Speaker 3>Fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you haven't seen it,</v>

1444
01:00:02.421 --> 01:00:05.450
<v Speaker 3>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a masterpiece.</v>

1445
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:08.960
<v Speaker 3>It's maybe one of the best shows ever on</v>
<v Speaker 3>television and it gets.</v>

1446
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:11.330
<v Speaker 3>It starts out you like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty good and then it gets</v>

1447
01:00:11.331 --> 01:00:15.260
<v Speaker 3>deeper and deeper and crazier and</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazier and there's never what I call a</v>

1448
01:00:15.261 --> 01:00:19.460
<v Speaker 3>cut the shit scene like in every show in</v>
<v Speaker 3>season three when she's in Russia and</v>

1449
01:00:19.461 --> 01:00:21.560
<v Speaker 3>she feels bad for the gay kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a cut.</v>

1450
01:00:21.561 --> 01:00:22.970
<v Speaker 3>The Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This woman is a sociopath.</v>

1451
01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:29.320
<v Speaker 3>She's not losing control and power just</v>
<v Speaker 3>to some gay rushed and she met the dude</v>

1452
01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:31.300
<v Speaker 3>who hangs himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spoiler alert.</v>

1453
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:36.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like that was as much political</v>

1454
01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:39.180
<v Speaker 3>as it was anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they showed her really caring.</v>

1455
01:00:39.181 --> 01:00:42.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to know these people are murderers</v>

1456
01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:46.580
<v Speaker 3>perhaps you're a bit cynical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little on me.</v>

1457
01:00:46.581 --> 01:00:48.930
<v Speaker 3>Pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Steve Irwin Boomerang hard.</v>

1458
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:53.210
<v Speaker 3>The late Steve Irwin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he a boomerang thrower?</v>

1459
01:00:53.211 --> 01:00:55.730
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was just like wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 3>crocodiles and showed us how to do that</v>

1460
01:00:55.731 --> 01:00:57.190
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably got less.</v>

1461
01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.700
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows how to write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1462
01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:00.140
<v Speaker 3>just chuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1463
01:01:00.141 --> 01:01:01.880
<v Speaker 3>is there a technique to throw a</v>
<v Speaker 3>boomerang?</v>

1464
01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:03.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

1465
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:04.350
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1466
01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:06.470
<v Speaker 3>Because they had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was weapons to knock things out.</v>

1467
01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:09.800
<v Speaker 3>What was the idea was that you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw it and then it would kind of come</v>

1468
01:01:09.801 --> 01:01:11.030
<v Speaker 3>back at you if you missed.</v>

1469
01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:13.100
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but which is funny because if you</v>

1470
01:01:13.101 --> 01:01:14.880
<v Speaker 3>actually have good aim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not coming back because it's</v>

1471
01:01:14.881 --> 01:01:16.060
<v Speaker 3>trajectories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Complete change,</v>

1472
01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:18.260
<v Speaker 3>but you're knocking things out of trees</v>
<v Speaker 3>or knocking birds out.</v>

1473
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:21.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean the great way to get a bee hive</v>
<v Speaker 3>off a tree.</v>

1474
01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:22.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what they use them for?</v>

1475
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:23.511
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing.</v>

1476
01:01:23.511 --> 01:01:24.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It kind of makes sense.</v>

1477
01:01:24.801 --> 01:01:25.430
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1478
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:28.620
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of an ingenious device.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you think about what a boomerang.</v>

1479
01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.550
<v Speaker 3>You remember when you were a kid the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first time you saw one or played with</v>

1480
01:01:31.551 --> 01:01:32.301
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1481
01:01:32.301 --> 01:01:34.370
<v Speaker 3>this is magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I maybe only played with one once or</v>

1482
01:01:34.371 --> 01:01:38.150
<v Speaker 3>twice in my whole life when I was a kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had one and I couldn't get it to work,</v>

1483
01:01:38.151 --> 01:01:39.530
<v Speaker 3>but I got to the kind of work and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1484
01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.240
<v Speaker 3>this is the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the future.</v>

1485
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:44.030
<v Speaker 3>This is a gay for his book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is</v>

1486
01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.580
<v Speaker 3>all due respect to my gay friends at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>MSI friends.</v>

1487
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just to make any sense.</v>

1488
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:55.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't get what you're doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any.</v>

1489
01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.850
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a weapon when it wasn't for</v>

1490
01:01:58.851 --> 01:01:59.420
<v Speaker 3>war though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1491
01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.590
<v Speaker 3>Was for hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1492
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:01.850
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1493
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.220
<v Speaker 3>don't you guys know about the bone</v>
<v Speaker 3>marrow?</v>

1494
01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:08.810
<v Speaker 3>We'll hook you guys up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lack of birds over in Australia.</v>

1495
01:02:08.811 --> 01:02:11.390
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have enough feathers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what do we do with these sticks?</v>

1496
01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:13.490
<v Speaker 3>But what about the Kookaburra lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1497
01:02:13.491 --> 01:02:16.580
<v Speaker 3>The Kookaburra Kookaburra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's their big bird.</v>

1498
01:02:16.581 --> 01:02:18.860
<v Speaker 3>That's always laughing Baja about moves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1499
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Don't they have feathers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you most at as one of them is in</v>

1500
01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.490
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the ostrich.</v>

1501
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.920
<v Speaker 3>The email in the Ria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess the Amazon Australia have huge</v>

1502
01:02:25.921 --> 01:02:26.920
<v Speaker 3>feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1503
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:29.990
<v Speaker 3>You feel like it could be trimmed down</v>
<v Speaker 3>for flushings?</v>

1504
01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:32.100
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know any better.</v>

1505
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:34.350
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that recent thing where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>said that the most,</v>

1506
01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:35.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1507
01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:38.610
<v Speaker 3>they found that the earliest</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australians,</v>

1508
01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:42.840
<v Speaker 3>the earliest indigenous people landed in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia 50,000 years ago,</v>

1509
01:02:42.841 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 3>which is fucking incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1510
01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.040
<v Speaker 3>Like how the hell they get their 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1511
01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:47.791
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1512
01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:48.780
<v Speaker 3>didn't they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

1513
01:02:48.781 --> 01:02:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with like Siberia and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bering Strait.</v>

1514
01:02:50.641 --> 01:02:52.050
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting to America as the question,</v>

1515
01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.940
<v Speaker 3>was there some sort of a landmass that</v>
<v Speaker 3>connected them to somewhere else 50,000</v>

1516
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:56.600
<v Speaker 3>years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1517
01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.230
<v Speaker 3>they're essentially an isolated</v>
<v Speaker 3>continent.</v>

1518
01:02:58.231 --> 01:02:58.800
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1519
01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.650
<v Speaker 3>Nothing's close unless you have those</v>
<v Speaker 3>archipelagos something New Zealand and</v>

1520
01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.760
<v Speaker 3>Papua New Guinea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1521
01:03:02.761 --> 01:03:04.020
<v Speaker 3>those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>

1522
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:09.050
<v Speaker 3>especially the South Pacific people were</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly daring in their journeys out</v>

1523
01:03:10.471 --> 01:03:12.870
<v Speaker 3>to see thousands and thousands of years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

1524
01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.470
<v Speaker 3>We dug out canoes and these boats that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would construct and they would just</v>

1525
01:03:16.471 --> 01:03:17.670
<v Speaker 3>fucking get out in the ocean.</v>

1526
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:18.600
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see what happens.</v>

1527
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:22.260
<v Speaker 3>They must have been having really bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>marriages to be getting this belt.</v>

1528
01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going west.</v>

1529
01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:26.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if there's land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not staying here with you.</v>

1530
01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:27.173
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1531
01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:31.770
<v Speaker 3>What makes a person get into a boat</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years ago and looking out</v>

1532
01:03:31.771 --> 01:03:32.491
<v Speaker 3>into the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go,</v>

1533
01:03:32.491 --> 01:03:34.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the funny thing is we think that</v>

1534
01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:36.220
<v Speaker 3>they're brave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe they just really dumb and like</v>

1535
01:03:36.221 --> 01:03:37.320
<v Speaker 3>a bad directions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1536
01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:40.260
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what causes someone to want to</v>

1537
01:03:40.261 --> 01:03:43.170
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you get to a continent and</v>

1538
01:03:43.171 --> 01:03:44.430
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck do I do now?</v>

1539
01:03:44.431 --> 01:03:45.930
<v Speaker 3>I guess this is my house now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1540
01:03:45.931 --> 01:03:49.800
<v Speaker 3>how about what they did with Hawaii?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they essentially found a fucking</v>

1541
01:03:49.801 --> 01:03:51.180
<v Speaker 3>volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just got lucky.</v>

1542
01:03:51.181 --> 01:03:51.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1543
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:54.300
<v Speaker 3>Volcano popping out of the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean.</v>

1544
01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We lucked out that we fly.</v>

1545
01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:58.260
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>

1546
01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:00.230
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at so much.</v>

1547
01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.880
<v Speaker 3>Very few bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No predators.</v>

1548
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:02.490
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1549
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:04.920
<v Speaker 3>I thought that's huge bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1550
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:06.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have snakes.</v>

1551
01:04:06.391 --> 01:04:09.090
<v Speaker 3>I know that they don't have snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe they have some bugs,</v>

1552
01:04:09.091 --> 01:04:12.720
<v Speaker 3>but you rarely see legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe these spiders and shit.</v>

1553
01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:14.310
<v Speaker 3>The problem with Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

1554
01:04:14.311 --> 01:04:18.180
<v Speaker 3>the problem with Hawaii is it a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stuff that they have over there came</v>

1555
01:04:18.181 --> 01:04:22.020
<v Speaker 3>from somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of things like birds</v>

1556
01:04:22.021 --> 01:04:25.430
<v Speaker 3>and they were stowaways on boats and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1557
01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.870
<v Speaker 3>Spam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spam pigs,</v>

1558
01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:30.450
<v Speaker 3>pigs in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a little wild pigs and deer,</v>

1559
01:04:30.490 --> 01:04:32.730
<v Speaker 3>all these weird dear access deer from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Asia.</v>

1560
01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.610
<v Speaker 3>They just recently had to save the giant</v>
<v Speaker 3>parrot,</v>

1561
01:04:35.611 --> 01:04:39.080
<v Speaker 3>the Kakapo in a near Australia because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were like 100 left because the Ra,</v>

1562
01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.110
<v Speaker 3>because they had no defenses.</v>

1563
01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:41.820
<v Speaker 3>They can't fly and the rats are eating</v>
<v Speaker 3>of all.</v>

1564
01:04:41.821 --> 01:04:44.190
<v Speaker 3>So they found,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found all of them,</v>

1565
01:04:44.191 --> 01:04:46.440
<v Speaker 3>moved them to a different island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed the rats and brought her back and</v>

1566
01:04:46.441 --> 01:04:47.850
<v Speaker 3>now they're being saved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

1567
01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.930
<v Speaker 3>They're really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1568
01:04:48.931 --> 01:04:51.930
<v Speaker 3>they've had a bunch of crazy experiments</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Australia with toads,</v>

1569
01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.140
<v Speaker 3>toads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then with bringing in cats and they</v>

1570
01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:59.340
<v Speaker 3>have feral cats and they kill all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground nesting birds and foxes to kill</v>

1571
01:04:59.341 --> 01:05:01.700
<v Speaker 3>the cats and cats like nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they.</v>

1572
01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:05.700
<v Speaker 3>All they do is kill birds and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>rodents in small animals and we think</v>

1573
01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:07.560
<v Speaker 3>because they're cute and you've played</v>
<v Speaker 3>with their belly,</v>

1574
01:05:07.561 --> 01:05:09.360
<v Speaker 3>but they are killing machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1575
01:05:09.361 --> 01:05:10.590
<v Speaker 3>they're cute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you raise them,</v>

1576
01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:13.720
<v Speaker 3>you have them at home and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>domesticate them and give them nothing</v>

1577
01:05:13.721 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 3>about cat food and pet them all the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they purr and they don't have any</v>

1578
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:18.610
<v Speaker 3>desire to go out there and.</v>

1579
01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:21.250
<v Speaker 3>And eat and rape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1580
01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:24.160
<v Speaker 3>All cat sex is rape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1581
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:29.110
<v Speaker 3>this way you look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will they have barb Dicks,</v>

1582
01:05:29.111 --> 01:05:29.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1583
01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:34.000
<v Speaker 3>They steal her up and then if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the male cat sees a female with the</v>

1584
01:05:34.001 --> 01:05:35.860
<v Speaker 3>litter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he kills the litter so she'll get a</v>

1585
01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:36.993
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again.</v>

1586
01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.910
<v Speaker 3>That's super common in the animal world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately.</v>

1587
01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the bear world,</v>

1588
01:05:41.711 --> 01:05:43.360
<v Speaker 3>it's even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They eat them too.</v>

1589
01:05:43.361 --> 01:05:46.120
<v Speaker 3>They really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bears are almost 100 percent cannibals.</v>

1590
01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1591
01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:51.190
<v Speaker 3>The the male bears eat all the cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the best way.</v>

1592
01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.350
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so counterintuitive,</v>

1593
01:05:53.351 --> 01:05:57.640
<v Speaker 3>but the best way to ensure a healthy</v>
<v Speaker 3>population of bears is to kill a male's.</v>

1594
01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.081
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1595
01:05:59.081 --> 01:06:01.620
<v Speaker 3>You have to kill the old bores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go the like,</v>

1596
01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.120
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the reasons why they</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually encourage,</v>

1597
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:08.020
<v Speaker 3>especially with black bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black bear hunting is encouraged,</v>

1598
01:06:08.021 --> 01:06:12.040
<v Speaker 3>is also really important because one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main things that they eat is Fonz,</v>

1599
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:16.150
<v Speaker 3>like if you want to have healthy moose</v>
<v Speaker 3>populations in deer populations,</v>

1600
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:20.200
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was there in Alberta when a friend of</v>

1601
01:06:20.201 --> 01:06:25.201
<v Speaker 3>mine actually saw a bear kill a cub and</v>
<v Speaker 3>chase the mother way killed the cub and</v>

1602
01:06:26.411 --> 01:06:28.600
<v Speaker 3>then the mother came back and finished</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cub off.</v>

1603
01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:33.460
<v Speaker 3>She hated herself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a dark world in the woods.</v>

1604
01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:35.920
<v Speaker 3>You think North Korea is rough being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking bear?</v>

1605
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:36.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1606
01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:37.880
<v Speaker 3>my I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might,</v>

1607
01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:39.970
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>my first job was writing for an aquarium</v>

1608
01:06:39.971 --> 01:06:41.770
<v Speaker 3>magazines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been obsessed with animals since I</v>

1609
01:06:41.771 --> 01:06:43.330
<v Speaker 3>was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aquariums.</v>

1610
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:46.030
<v Speaker 3>That was my thing back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

1611
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:49.720
<v Speaker 3>I always wanted to have a massive</v>
<v Speaker 3>saltwater fish tank.</v>

1612
01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:53.040
<v Speaker 3>The best thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had all these secrets and shit.</v>

1613
01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:53.711
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1614
01:06:53.711 --> 01:06:57.610
<v Speaker 3>I had the kind of fish I had wrote my</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend called God's mistakes because</v>

1615
01:06:57.611 --> 01:07:01.230
<v Speaker 3>they all look like monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the kind of shit.</v>

1616
01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:04.000
<v Speaker 3>What did you have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something called a big guy.</v>

1617
01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:06.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something called a cal fish,</v>

1618
01:07:06.101 --> 01:07:08.110
<v Speaker 3>which can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's encased in armor and can't move,</v>

1619
01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:10.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a soap fish which releases a cloud</v>

1620
01:07:10.841 --> 01:07:13.300
<v Speaker 3>of poisoned when it's upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And an Angler fish,</v>

1621
01:07:13.301 --> 01:07:15.100
<v Speaker 3>which also doesn't move at a slipper.</v>

1622
01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:18.130
<v Speaker 3>I may pull up these things there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all look like aliens.</v>

1623
01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:21.700
<v Speaker 3>So it was really kind of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1624
01:07:21.701 --> 01:07:25.300
<v Speaker 3>It's just electric catfish that you had</v>
<v Speaker 3>an electric shock.</v>

1625
01:07:25.301 --> 01:07:26.410
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you in your balls.</v>

1626
01:07:26.730 --> 01:07:28.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I touched on electric eel.</v>

1627
01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:30.520
<v Speaker 3>We were on food fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes I do.</v>

1628
01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.430
<v Speaker 3>If you touch an electric eel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get fucked up.</v>

1629
01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:34.860
<v Speaker 3>Those things are no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1630
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:36.760
<v Speaker 3>they're not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can kill you.</v>

1631
01:07:36.790 --> 01:07:37.630
<v Speaker 3>How long?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How big was it?</v>

1632
01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:39.640
<v Speaker 3>That was big enough for me to grab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1633
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:41.290
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did it on fear factor was one of the</v>

1634
01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.700
<v Speaker 3>stones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you had to do it in one hand.</v>

1635
01:07:42.701 --> 01:07:44.530
<v Speaker 3>You can't do with both hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We also go through your heart,</v>

1636
01:07:44.531 --> 01:07:46.210
<v Speaker 3>remember?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1637
01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:47.830
<v Speaker 3>I remember this fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If something like,</v>

1638
01:07:47.831 --> 01:07:49.090
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where'd they get these electric eels for</v>

1639
01:07:49.091 --> 01:07:50.620
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is they had to do with one</v>

1640
01:07:50.621 --> 01:07:53.170
<v Speaker 3>hand or else it makes a circuit if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>use them both hands.</v>

1641
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:56.020
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the slipper lobster,</v>

1642
01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:59.710
<v Speaker 3>but what I do remember is it sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I definitely grabbed it and was</v>

1643
01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:00.200
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1644
01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.780
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no joke.</v>

1645
01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:05.160
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing that a small animal can</v>
<v Speaker 3>give you such a charge like that.</v>

1646
01:08:05.161 --> 01:08:07.120
<v Speaker 3>And it does it with its body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole,</v>

1647
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:10.070
<v Speaker 3>the anus is right by the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the whole thing is electricity.</v>

1648
01:08:10.071 --> 01:08:10.904
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that cool?</v>

1649
01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:13.970
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's electric mouth was right</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the asshole.</v>

1650
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:17.420
<v Speaker 3>It's all fucking confused you to notice</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's crazy.</v>

1651
01:08:17.421 --> 01:08:18.200
<v Speaker 3>Look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is that called?</v>

1652
01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.710
<v Speaker 3>A slipper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lobster slipper.</v>

1653
01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.820
<v Speaker 3>Have lobster tail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's often this face of that thing.</v>

1654
01:08:22.821 --> 01:08:24.380
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So instead of clause,</v>

1655
01:08:24.381 --> 01:08:25.940
<v Speaker 3>they have faced flaps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The two hinges.</v>

1656
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.080
<v Speaker 3>Whites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1657
01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.570
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you see that one hinge and another?</v>

1658
01:08:29.571 --> 01:08:30.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the hinges goes up and</v>

1659
01:08:30.831 --> 01:08:31.940
<v Speaker 3>down the other goes left and right.</v>

1660
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:33.680
<v Speaker 3>And all my guts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like the Predator.</v>

1661
01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:34.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really cool.</v>

1662
01:08:34.730 --> 01:08:36.820
<v Speaker 3>Do they have one with his mouth open?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1663
01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:40.670
<v Speaker 3>the mass underneath maybe meaning we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's exposed,</v>

1664
01:08:40.671 --> 01:08:42.090
<v Speaker 3>where it's like grabbing something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to be.</v>

1665
01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:43.910
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you won't see it because it wouldn't,</v>

1666
01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:45.780
<v Speaker 3>I would feed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would grab it and put it near with</v>

1667
01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.210
<v Speaker 3>the belly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

1668
01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:47.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1669
01:08:47.661 --> 01:08:50.360
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And pull up a p,</v>

1670
01:08:50.361 --> 01:08:55.361
<v Speaker 3>R I s t e g e n y s I didn't know until</v>
<v Speaker 3>like two years ago what cuddle fish and</v>

1671
01:08:58.910 --> 01:09:01.060
<v Speaker 3>octopus could do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend remy,</v>

1672
01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:04.820
<v Speaker 3>he used to have this show called Apex</v>
<v Speaker 3>Predator where he would study these</v>

1673
01:09:04.821 --> 01:09:09.170
<v Speaker 3>predators and try to figure out like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what strategies do you use for catching</v>

1674
01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.210
<v Speaker 3>their prey?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that he studied</v>

1675
01:09:11.211 --> 01:09:14.420
<v Speaker 3>was a octopus and he came on Octopi and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

1676
01:09:14.421 --> 01:09:15.760
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're from another planet.</v>

1677
01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:18.560
<v Speaker 3>Their smartest cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other very smart,</v>

1678
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:20.150
<v Speaker 3>very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super smart.</v>

1679
01:09:20.210 --> 01:09:23.540
<v Speaker 3>And they can not just change the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look,</v>

1680
01:09:23.541 --> 01:09:25.130
<v Speaker 3>but change their texture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1681
01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:27.280
<v Speaker 3>And they fit in perfectly with our</v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

1682
01:09:27.281 --> 01:09:28.700
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He showed us some videos and I'm like,</v>

1683
01:09:28.701 --> 01:09:31.810
<v Speaker 3>how am I 48 years old and not knowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this.</v>

1684
01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.770
<v Speaker 3>They were absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the ones at the bottom to see even</v>

1685
01:09:33.771 --> 01:09:35.930
<v Speaker 3>crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have the zebra octopus,</v>

1686
01:09:35.931 --> 01:09:39.710
<v Speaker 3>which is a mimic and the question you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a philosophy person is,</v>

1687
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:42.500
<v Speaker 3>is it consciously trying to look like</v>
<v Speaker 3>something else or data devolve.</v>

1688
01:09:42.570 --> 01:09:43.670
<v Speaker 3>Coincidentally it looked like because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1689
01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:47.640
<v Speaker 3>they look like flounders and then squids</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then lion fish and mantis shrimp and</v>

1690
01:09:47.641 --> 01:09:49.670
<v Speaker 3>like some of these forms wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 3>advantageous.</v>

1691
01:09:49.671 --> 01:09:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Like why would you want to look like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>flounder?</v>

1692
01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.870
<v Speaker 3>But it just changes from shape to shape</v>
<v Speaker 3>just very quickly.</v>

1693
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:56.060
<v Speaker 3>Well not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how does it know what the</v>

1694
01:09:56.061 --> 01:09:58.280
<v Speaker 3>environment looks like to a point where</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could change it,</v>

1695
01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.540
<v Speaker 3>how does it know what it looks like?</v>

1696
01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:01.190
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have a mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the other thing.</v>

1697
01:10:01.191 --> 01:10:03.220
<v Speaker 3>They put them on top of a checkerboard</v>
<v Speaker 3>deceased.</v>

1698
01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:04.600
<v Speaker 3>They can emit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imitate it and they like,</v>

1699
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:05.910
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1700
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.410
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1701
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Well they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can imitate all sorts of different</v>

1702
01:10:08.361 --> 01:10:11.450
<v Speaker 3>surfaces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coral and all sorts of different crazy</v>

1703
01:10:11.451 --> 01:10:12.051
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's.</v>

1704
01:10:12.051 --> 01:10:15.650
<v Speaker 3>And what they'll do is they'll release</v>
<v Speaker 3>their cloud of ink and then what move.</v>

1705
01:10:15.651 --> 01:10:18.560
<v Speaker 3>But they'll just change shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it looks like they vanished like a</v>

1706
01:10:18.561 --> 01:10:19.430
<v Speaker 3>super villain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1707
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:21.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they think that that's like the.</v>

1708
01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:25.160
<v Speaker 3>There was one speculation that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>blast of ink that they shoot out is</v>

1709
01:10:25.161 --> 01:10:28.190
<v Speaker 3>almost like the like correction fluid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like white out.</v>

1710
01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:29.180
<v Speaker 3>Like those are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not what I meant.</v>

1711
01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:31.820
<v Speaker 3>Like oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That they do it to each other,</v>

1712
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:35.720
<v Speaker 3>like to like to stop conversations and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that part of what they're doing when</v>

1713
01:10:35.721 --> 01:10:39.130
<v Speaker 3>they're changing their body is like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>visual form of communication that will.</v>

1714
01:10:39.130 --> 01:10:40.940
<v Speaker 3>They definitely do like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like chameleons.</v>

1715
01:10:40.941 --> 01:10:42.470
<v Speaker 3>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Communities don't always change color</v>

1716
01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.600
<v Speaker 3>for evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll do it for protection.</v>

1717
01:10:44.601 --> 01:10:47.150
<v Speaker 3>They'll become red show anger and its</v>
<v Speaker 3>mood.</v>

1718
01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:50.030
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had changed color based on mood to</v>

1719
01:10:50.031 --> 01:10:51.440
<v Speaker 3>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating.</v>

1720
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:54.680
<v Speaker 3>Mood fish like mood rings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better mood rings.</v>

1721
01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.190
<v Speaker 3>Well it's good because some fish when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are the water's dirty,</v>

1722
01:10:58.191 --> 01:11:00.530
<v Speaker 3>they'll be a different color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you'll know it's time for water</v>

1723
01:11:00.531 --> 01:11:01.640
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The catfish did that.</v>

1724
01:11:01.730 --> 01:11:02.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they look sick,</v>

1725
01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:03.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just get darker.</v>

1726
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:06.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh just not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just dusky or it's like,</v>

1727
01:11:06.921 --> 01:11:08.870
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to make him lemonade colored</v>

1728
01:11:08.871 --> 01:11:09.860
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

1729
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:12.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that when they put an octopus</v>

1730
01:11:12.831 --> 01:11:13.940
<v Speaker 3>on checkerboard that did</v>

1731
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:16.410
<v Speaker 1>mimic the checkerboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it couldn't figure it couldn't get it</v>

1732
01:11:16.411 --> 01:11:17.820
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you find that?</v>

1733
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:19.230
<v Speaker 1>That was confusing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

1734
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:22.560
<v Speaker 1>There was something similar to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some sort of a striped pattern</v>

1735
01:11:22.561 --> 01:11:24.750
<v Speaker 1>that it mimicked the strife steak I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think they can do,</v>

1736
01:11:24.751 --> 01:11:27.090
<v Speaker 1>but the checker boards the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>

1737
01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:30.260
<v Speaker 1>So what are the best one is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flamboyant cuttlefish.</v>

1738
01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.760
<v Speaker 1>They just discovered it's two inches</v>
<v Speaker 1>long walks,</v>

1739
01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's colored like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a.</v>

1740
01:11:34.561 --> 01:11:37.620
<v Speaker 1>it's like an acid trip and they're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

1741
01:11:37.621 --> 01:11:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flamboyant.</v>

1742
01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:40.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the official name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flamboyant cuttlefish.</v>

1743
01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it true that they've only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've only researched like 10 percent</v>

1744
01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:45.720
<v Speaker 1>of the ocean floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1745
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:46.583
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1746
01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's my friend came up with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>name God's mistakes because God made</v>

1747
01:11:49.861 --> 01:11:50.694
<v Speaker 1>some fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1748
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:52.020
<v Speaker 1>well no one's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that.</v>

1749
01:11:52.021 --> 01:11:54.630
<v Speaker 1>They're just throwing the in the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they all look like monsters.</v>

1750
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:57.090
<v Speaker 1>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>my theory is because there's no light</v>

1751
01:11:57.091 --> 01:12:00.600
<v Speaker 1>down there that things like visuals</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are based on mathematics don't</v>

1752
01:12:00.601 --> 01:12:02.370
<v Speaker 1>apply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's okay that they're hideous</v>

1753
01:12:02.371 --> 01:12:03.420
<v Speaker 1>because no one's going to be seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1754
01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.380
<v Speaker 1>What about bioluminescent fish and</v>
<v Speaker 1>phosphorescent ones?</v>

1755
01:12:06.381 --> 01:12:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's weird ones that they create</v>

1756
01:12:08.131 --> 01:12:09.540
<v Speaker 1>their own light bulbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all have.</v>

1757
01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:12.780
<v Speaker 1>They almost all have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one which uses red light because</v>

1758
01:12:12.781 --> 01:12:15.370
<v Speaker 1>others can't see red and they use them</v>
<v Speaker 1>like search lights.</v>

1759
01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much crazy shit.</v>

1760
01:12:18.181 --> 01:12:20.520
<v Speaker 1>The bottom of the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fascinating.</v>

1761
01:12:20.521 --> 01:12:22.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we found what's really fascinating to</v>

1762
01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:25.560
<v Speaker 1>me is if we found any of this stuff in</v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

1763
01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:29.340
<v Speaker 1>we'd be freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why I never could like star trek</v>

1764
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:34.410
<v Speaker 1>because it drove me crazy as an autistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>young boy are you autistic,</v>

1765
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:38.700
<v Speaker 1>but for this purpose I am that I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>know all these zoological animals that</v>

1766
01:12:38.701 --> 01:12:40.080
<v Speaker 1>look like insane things.</v>

1767
01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Walking back fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can't swim,</v>

1768
01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:45.140
<v Speaker 1>and then I turned on Star Trek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's another planet and it's a guy with</v>

1769
01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:49.560
<v Speaker 1>fucking blue skin and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get blue skin.</v>

1770
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Show me something that's not based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human form.</v>

1771
01:12:52.291 --> 01:12:56.260
<v Speaker 1>You fucking ass each all the job is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the octopus cuttlefish,</v>

1772
01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:58.620
<v Speaker 1>cuttlefish octopus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Java.</v>

1773
01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:01.440
<v Speaker 1>The Hudson was what blew my mind as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid because they look like aliens.</v>

1774
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite one was that stupid lizard</v>

1775
01:13:03.691 --> 01:13:06.270
<v Speaker 1>guy that Captain Kirk had a fight with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

1776
01:13:06.271 --> 01:13:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I remember that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never watched star trek for this</v>

1777
01:13:08.461 --> 01:13:09.390
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even joking.</v>

1778
01:13:09.450 --> 01:13:11.160
<v Speaker 1>It's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1779
01:13:11.161 --> 01:13:14.970
<v Speaker 1>so here's the cuttlefish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's on the ground and there's a like a</v>

1780
01:13:14.971 --> 01:13:17.220
<v Speaker 1>sandy bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he kind of looks like the sandy</v>

1781
01:13:17.221 --> 01:13:20.300
<v Speaker 1>bottom and then they put this at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

1782
01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.550
<v Speaker 1>It took it off so could switch back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Best I did was that little block.</v>

1783
01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty impressive.</v>

1784
01:13:24.791 --> 01:13:27.210
<v Speaker 1>If we fucking close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did its best,</v>

1785
01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:30.120
<v Speaker 1>but how did it know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The eyes are on the side,</v>

1786
01:13:30.121 --> 01:13:31.830
<v Speaker 1>so they're looking at an old directions</v>
<v Speaker 1>at once,</v>

1787
01:13:31.831 --> 01:13:33.040
<v Speaker 1>like a rabbit or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as a no,</v>

1788
01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:34.440
<v Speaker 1>to make a square.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1789
01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:36.360
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look what it's doing it right there.</v>

1790
01:13:36.450 --> 01:13:38.250
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's creepy.</v>

1791
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1792
01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Look a flamboyant cuttlefish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to see this shit.</v>

1793
01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:47.520
<v Speaker 1>It's toxic as hell to these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1794
01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:51.660
<v Speaker 1>what caused them to evolve like this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been around forever.</v>

1795
01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Forever and they also have very short</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifespans.</v>

1796
01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not even working.</v>

1797
01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.100
<v Speaker 1>What keeps you alive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long week</v>

1798
01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:02.940
<v Speaker 1>look like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1799
01:14:02.941 --> 01:14:05.280
<v Speaker 1>this is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

1800
01:14:05.281 --> 01:14:07.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those always are it.</v>

1801
01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the water.</v>

1802
01:14:09.001 --> 01:14:10.620
<v Speaker 1>It's making it look like there's a wave</v>
<v Speaker 1>of skin.</v>

1803
01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:14.830
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at us eyes too,</v>

1804
01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:17.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they're the first ones.</v>

1805
01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:19.600
<v Speaker 3>They found that walk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a tiny water.</v>

1806
01:14:19.601 --> 01:14:22.480
<v Speaker 3>Hippo is that lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's cute and she just wants to know.</v>

1807
01:14:22.481 --> 01:14:25.060
<v Speaker 3>She's cute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that thing.</v>

1808
01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:26.470
<v Speaker 3>My God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

1809
01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:31.150
<v Speaker 3>That is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's hypnotic.</v>

1810
01:14:31.151 --> 01:14:32.670
<v Speaker 3>It's meant to be hypnotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lucky break up.</v>

1811
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:33.663
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

1812
01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:34.191
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1813
01:14:34.191 --> 01:14:39.191
<v Speaker 3>You look at it and it shoots this</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking alien thing like the Ridley</v>

1814
01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Scott Alien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find them out the second time now and</v>

1815
01:14:42.101 --> 01:14:47.101
<v Speaker 3>jabs at fish fuckin a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if we found that on Jupiter or rice</v>

1816
01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:51.880
<v Speaker 3>or something like we'll be freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's two inches.</v>

1817
01:14:51.881 --> 01:14:53.190
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this shit?</v>

1818
01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:53.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1819
01:14:53.591 --> 01:14:55.810
<v Speaker 3>if this was anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they found this,</v>

1820
01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:58.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pick a pick a planet in our solar</v>

1821
01:14:58.241 --> 01:15:00.790
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would be so obsessed with it.</v>

1822
01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:02.290
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that it's in the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1823
01:15:02.291 --> 01:15:03.124
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's right over there.</v>

1824
01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just found it pretty recently to</v>

1825
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:08.223
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1826
01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:13.450
<v Speaker 3>I think in the nineties there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>website that was dedicated to a bunch of</v>

1827
01:15:13.451 --> 01:15:16.510
<v Speaker 3>animals that were uncovered during one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the tsunamis.</v>

1828
01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:19.540
<v Speaker 3>I think it was the big tsunami that hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it Vietnam or Thailand?</v>

1829
01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:21.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it</v>

1830
01:15:22.890 --> 01:15:23.500
<v Speaker 3>somewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1831
01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:27.610
<v Speaker 3>but there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think now that I'm saying is I feel</v>

1832
01:15:27.611 --> 01:15:29.410
<v Speaker 3>like it was debunked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like someone said,</v>

1833
01:15:29.411 --> 01:15:30.550
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not where they came from,</v>

1834
01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:35.580
<v Speaker 3>but it was a series of super bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals that were found super bizarre</v>

1835
01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:39.910
<v Speaker 3>fish they found at the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean that literally looked like they</v>

1836
01:15:39.911 --> 01:15:41.500
<v Speaker 3>came from another world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look up.</v>

1837
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:43.780
<v Speaker 3>There's something called a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1838
01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:47.920
<v Speaker 3>mouse trap fish where it's now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a mouse trap.</v>

1839
01:15:47.921 --> 01:15:50.000
<v Speaker 3>It's hinged and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1840
01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:51.320
<v Speaker 3>it works like a mouse trap.</v>

1841
01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:52.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about the anglerfish?</v>

1842
01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.550
<v Speaker 3>He's got a fishing pole hanging off his</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking head.</v>

1843
01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:55.091
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had.</v>

1844
01:15:55.091 --> 01:15:57.730
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>angler fishes and the best,</v>

1845
01:15:57.731 --> 01:15:59.290
<v Speaker 3>there's one called the clown angler</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish,</v>

1846
01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:01.540
<v Speaker 3>which has warts all over it and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>very brightly colored.</v>

1847
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.200
<v Speaker 3>And this they to do Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one,</v>

1848
01:16:05.290 --> 01:16:07.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're almost asking them too many things</v>

1849
01:16:07.091 --> 01:16:08.230
<v Speaker 3>to google.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just one thing.</v>

1850
01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:10.420
<v Speaker 3>This is the one they'll blow your</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking mind.</v>

1851
01:16:10.450 --> 01:16:13.420
<v Speaker 3>The football fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's amazing about them is the</v>

1852
01:16:13.421 --> 01:16:16.720
<v Speaker 3>females are like a yard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the males are two inches long and</v>

1853
01:16:16.721 --> 01:16:20.110
<v Speaker 3>the males attached the females and lose</v>
<v Speaker 3>their sense of identity becomes sperm</v>

1854
01:16:20.111 --> 01:16:21.010
<v Speaker 3>glands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh look,</v>

1855
01:16:21.011 --> 01:16:23.890
<v Speaker 3>regular dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

1856
01:16:24.190 --> 01:16:25.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

1857
01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:27.460
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't figure out where the males</v>
<v Speaker 3>were for a long time.</v>

1858
01:16:27.461 --> 01:16:29.170
<v Speaker 3>The female said just these growths on</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1859
01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:32.380
<v Speaker 3>And they were male.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were the males Angler anglerfish.</v>

1860
01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Well crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The football fish.</v>

1861
01:16:35.021 --> 01:16:36.580
<v Speaker 3>And I typed it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1862
01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:38.820
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's tricking backwards with that</v>

1863
01:16:38.850 --> 01:16:41.350
<v Speaker 3>photograph,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's one with the dangle it</v>

1864
01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:44.050
<v Speaker 3>dangles if that's as a female.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she dangles it in.</v>

1865
01:16:44.130 --> 01:16:45.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's looked at that they dangled over</v>

1866
01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:46.420
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the other,</v>

1867

<v Speaker 3>there's so many of them.</v>

1876

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.650
<v Speaker 3>Hold our creep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1880
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:22.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean that doesn't even look like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>real thing.</v>

1881

<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>That one's bio luminescence?</v>

1883
01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:28.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see where the spots are.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1891
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:46.700
<v Speaker 3>The colors in that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it looks like it's bolted together.</v>

1892
01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:48.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like patchwork.</v>

1893
01:17:48.261 --> 01:17:50.120
<v Speaker 3>Like some sort of an animated movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1894
01:17:50.130 --> 01:17:54.440
<v Speaker 3>There's the deep sea is my favorite kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of stuff with all this crazy shit.</v>

1895
01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:57.230
<v Speaker 3>But what's the most underappreciated and</v>
<v Speaker 3>overlooked?</v>

1896
01:17:57.231 --> 01:17:58.670
<v Speaker 3>Go to that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's up right above that,</v>

1902
01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:10.030
<v Speaker 3>that does not look real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1903
01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.900
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things are amazing.</v>

1904
01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:12.973
<v Speaker 3>Look up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1905
01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:16.490
<v Speaker 3>red lipped walking batfish fish because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one that's a relative of this.</v>

1906
01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:18.890
<v Speaker 3>There wears lipstick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walking,</v>

1907
01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.560
<v Speaker 3>walking back fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1908
01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:26.990
<v Speaker 3>Why in the fuck is that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't swim.</v>

1909
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:28.410
<v Speaker 3>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1910
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:32.410
<v Speaker 3>they have a nose and out of the nose is</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the angle comes from.</v>

1911
01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:34.700
<v Speaker 3>That's my favorite fish.</v>

1912
01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Look at that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1913
01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:38.660
<v Speaker 3>Look at the lips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1914
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:41.810
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that amazing?</v>

1915
01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1916
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:46.040
<v Speaker 3>they're very hard to keep in captivity</v>
<v Speaker 3>to species because they always have</v>

1917
01:18:46.041 --> 01:18:47.330
<v Speaker 3>parasites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1918
01:18:47.331 --> 01:18:48.164
<v Speaker 3>is that why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1919
01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.270
<v Speaker 3>Why can't they keep great whites in</v>
<v Speaker 3>captivity?</v>

1920
01:18:50.650 --> 01:18:55.650
<v Speaker 3>Because a great whites are extremely</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitive to electric impulses in the</v>

1921
01:18:55.761 --> 01:18:57.470
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they keep banging their heads against</v>

1922
01:18:57.471 --> 01:18:59.720
<v Speaker 3>the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plus their pelagic,</v>

1923
01:18:59.721 --> 01:19:01.850
<v Speaker 3>which means they live in the ocean where</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing around them,</v>

1924
01:19:01.851 --> 01:19:04.880
<v Speaker 3>so they're not used to any barriers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this really fucks them up.</v>

1925
01:19:04.881 --> 01:19:07.070
<v Speaker 3>They need to be able to go full speed</v>
<v Speaker 3>for miles at a time.</v>

1926
01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1927
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:10.880
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got a whale sharks in captivity</v>

1928
01:19:10.881 --> 01:19:13.940
<v Speaker 3>that Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they've got three in Georgia and</v>

1929
01:19:13.941 --> 01:19:15.410
<v Speaker 3>Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How big is the tank?</v>

1930
01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.630
<v Speaker 3>It's Jack gets the biggest tank in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

1931
01:19:17.631 --> 01:19:18.441
<v Speaker 3>or second biggest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1932
01:19:18.441 --> 01:19:20.330
<v Speaker 3>the glass was like two feet thick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the crazy.</v>

1933
01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:24.350
<v Speaker 3>So it seems stupid to keep them</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1934
01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:25.700
<v Speaker 3>go see them in the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1935
01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:27.180
<v Speaker 3>Philippines for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Great.</v>

1936
01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:30.330
<v Speaker 3>Then watch them on video just seems</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up to me.</v>

1937
01:19:30.331 --> 01:19:33.620
<v Speaker 3>To keep those things in captivity just</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't make any sense.</v>

1938
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:35.570
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1939
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:36.643
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1940
01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:37.581
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1941
01:19:37.581 --> 01:19:39.620
<v Speaker 3>If you could talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1942
01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:42.740
<v Speaker 3>probably be like prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like super bummed out.</v>

1943
01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:44.330
<v Speaker 3>It's just like North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for fish.</v>

1944
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:45.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to have a joke about that,</v>

1945
01:19:45.501 --> 01:19:47.540
<v Speaker 3>about like someone like saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1946
01:19:47.541 --> 01:19:48.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that bad.</v>

1947
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:51.230
<v Speaker 3>I went to the zoo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw these chimps playing with a rope</v>

1948
01:19:51.231 --> 01:19:52.370
<v Speaker 3>and they look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're having a good time.</v>

1949
01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:53.180
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1950
01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:55.520
<v Speaker 3>go to prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Watch dudes playing basketball.</v>

1951
01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:56.840
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't mean it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1952
01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:58.530
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially with the higher end in prison</v>

1953
01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.630
<v Speaker 3>that are intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1954
01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if people have pets were</v>

1955
01:20:01.581 --> 01:20:02.000
<v Speaker 3>birds.</v>

1956
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big pet person,</v>

1957
01:20:03.741 --> 01:20:06.560
<v Speaker 3>but the bird wants to be flying around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1958
01:20:06.710 --> 01:20:08.610
<v Speaker 3>Like when they clip their wings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you don't need these.</v>

1959
01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I needed to keep you around.</v>

1960
01:20:10.670 --> 01:20:12.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that makes you special</v>

1961
01:20:12.601 --> 01:20:16.530
<v Speaker 3>and I want to say hello.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me clip your wings.</v>

1962
01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:17.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1963
01:20:17.850 --> 01:20:19.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're weird.</v>

1964
01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:21.180
<v Speaker 3>We're weird with our dominance over</v>
<v Speaker 3>other animals,</v>

1965
01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:25.440
<v Speaker 3>but I mean I guess every animal that has</v>
<v Speaker 3>control over their animals is weird.</v>

1966
01:20:25.441 --> 01:20:26.970
<v Speaker 3>Like if you've seen that thing about</v>
<v Speaker 3>dolphins,</v>

1967
01:20:26.971 --> 01:20:28.740
<v Speaker 3>they take puffer fish and they get high</v>
<v Speaker 3>with them,</v>

1968
01:20:29.190 --> 01:20:30.330
<v Speaker 3>they pass them around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1969
01:20:30.331 --> 01:20:32.250
<v Speaker 3>I killer whales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kill babies for fun.</v>

1970
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a good time.</v>

1971
01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:35.340
<v Speaker 3>They're sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah.</v>

1972
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.020
<v Speaker 3>It will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dolphins do the exact same thing that</v>

1973
01:20:37.021 --> 01:20:39.210
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cats do where they kill off the,</v>

1974
01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:43.410
<v Speaker 3>the young to make the female breed</v>
<v Speaker 3>because a female dolphin won't go into</v>

1975
01:20:43.411 --> 01:20:44.244
<v Speaker 3>breeding.</v>

1976
01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:47.400
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like six or seven years</v>
<v Speaker 3>while she was raising the kid.</v>

1977
01:20:47.401 --> 01:20:48.234
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1978
01:20:48.330 --> 01:20:53.070
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that females do to</v>
<v Speaker 3>mitigate this is they fuck as many males</v>

1979
01:20:53.071 --> 01:20:56.550
<v Speaker 3>as they can because they obviously they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have Maury Povich and DNA tests</v>

1980
01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:58.930
<v Speaker 3>and the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they fuck is.</v>

1981
01:20:59.010 --> 01:21:02.830
<v Speaker 3>They're like extremely promiscuous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea behind it,</v>

1982
01:21:02.831 --> 01:21:07.080
<v Speaker 3>if they fuck enough of these males,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy will have no idea whose baby is</v>

1983
01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:10.650
<v Speaker 3>so think it's his baby fuck to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be my kid.</v>

1984
01:21:10.651 --> 01:21:11.484
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to eat them.</v>

1985
01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.890
<v Speaker 3>My knowledge if the C is just limited to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish.</v>

1986
01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.520
<v Speaker 3>So let's get some novelists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking,</v>

1987
01:21:15.521 --> 01:21:17.880
<v Speaker 3>I've kind of like c student,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're a Dork,</v>

1988
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:19.870
<v Speaker 3>like you really love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Dork.</v>

1989
01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:23.230
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all different kinds of species.</v>

1990
01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:25.670
<v Speaker 3>I can rattle off things all day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like every.</v>

1991
01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.360
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about the Tasmanian</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tiger?</v>

1992
01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.360
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that things alive that day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're thinking of trying to clone it</v>

1993
01:21:32.611 --> 01:21:34.320
<v Speaker 3>back because they have ones in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Formaldehyde,</v>

1994
01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:35.213
<v Speaker 3>do they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1995
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:37.260
<v Speaker 3>So it died out in the twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>

1996
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:39.990
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's somewhere around there and</v>

1997
01:21:39.991 --> 01:21:41.330
<v Speaker 3>because we have video of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1998
01:21:41.410 --> 01:21:44.460
<v Speaker 3>One in captivity and they are thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>of trying to clone it and bring it back.</v>

1999
01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:45.780
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is right there.</v>

2000
01:21:45.781 --> 01:21:47.790
<v Speaker 3>What a great is fabulous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the only animal that can open.</v>

2001
01:21:47.791 --> 01:21:49.950
<v Speaker 3>It's not like 120 degrees or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2002
01:21:49.951 --> 01:21:53.970
<v Speaker 3>they think that they might have a few of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them still in the wild because Australia</v>

2003
01:21:53.971 --> 01:21:56.610
<v Speaker 3>is essentially the size of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>contiguous United States,</v>

2004
01:21:56.611 --> 01:22:00.300
<v Speaker 3>but with the same amount of people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Los Angeles and they think that it might</v>

2005
01:22:00.301 --> 01:22:03.060
<v Speaker 3>be possible because there's been several</v>
<v Speaker 3>sightings at these things,</v>

2006
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:05.340
<v Speaker 3>but then you gotta think there's several</v>
<v Speaker 3>sightings and bigfoot.</v>

2007
01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:07.350
<v Speaker 3>I love cryptozoology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

2008
01:22:07.351 --> 01:22:10.090
<v Speaker 3>It's just absolutely fascinating because</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the coloration looks like they'll</v>

2009
01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:13.320
<v Speaker 3>copy which is the giraffes closest</v>
<v Speaker 3>relative and they thought that was fake</v>

2010
01:22:13.321 --> 01:22:16.740
<v Speaker 3>and then they found one another in zoos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see it's a crazy looking at</v>

2011
01:22:16.741 --> 01:22:17.430
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2012
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:21.510
<v Speaker 3>but do you think that that thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's enough sightings where</v>

2013
01:22:21.511 --> 01:22:25.920
<v Speaker 3>they're starting to actively consider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a a movie with what the Fuck</v>

2014
01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:30.600
<v Speaker 3>Willem defoe several years ago where</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone had hired him to go and shoot a</v>

2015
01:22:30.601 --> 01:22:35.601
<v Speaker 3>Tasmanian Tiger that they knew were one</v>
<v Speaker 3>was and that somebody wanted it to stuff</v>

2016
01:22:35.641 --> 01:22:40.200
<v Speaker 3>at or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was this species of insect on St</v>

2017
01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.550
<v Speaker 3>Helena Island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was where they thought it was</v>

2018
01:22:41.551 --> 01:22:44.730
<v Speaker 3>extinct or they found a bush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There had 13 of them and now they bred</v>

2019
01:22:44.731 --> 01:22:48.270
<v Speaker 3>them and there's like thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if they found one it would be great</v>

2020
01:22:48.271 --> 01:22:50.670
<v Speaker 3>because they'd be able to breed them to</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge numbers pretty quickly.</v>

2021
01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:52.680
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like one of the last predators</v>

2022
01:22:52.681 --> 01:22:54.520
<v Speaker 3>other than like saltwater crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2023
01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:55.830
<v Speaker 3>In Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2024
01:22:56.050 --> 01:22:56.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2025
01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:59.310
<v Speaker 3>The dingoes no joke there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been taken out a lot of stuff.</v>

2026
01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.930
<v Speaker 3>They have that whole dingo fence for</v>
<v Speaker 3>that reason.</v>

2027
01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2028
01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.650
<v Speaker 3>Australia is a really weird place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2029
01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 3>Some of mine were just over there.</v>

2030
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:08.100
<v Speaker 2>They were hunting water buffaloes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2031
01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:10.450
<v Speaker 2>it was Asian water buffaloes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge,</v>

2032
01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.540
<v Speaker 2>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also an invasive species.</v>

2033
01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:17.620
<v Speaker 2>So these things come over and they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroy the water like anything else.</v>

2034
01:23:17.650 --> 01:23:22.650
<v Speaker 2>That truck 2000 plus millions and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just shit everywhere and ruin all the</v>

2035
01:23:24.521 --> 01:23:26.050
<v Speaker 2>water sources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all these birds,</v>

2036
01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:28.810
<v Speaker 2>all these different animals that need</v>
<v Speaker 2>that water all getting fucked up and</v>

2037
01:23:28.811 --> 01:23:30.430
<v Speaker 2>dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see one when it took out</v>

2038
01:23:30.431 --> 01:23:33.250
<v Speaker 2>the lion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did see something like that recently.</v>

2039
01:23:33.251 --> 01:23:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2040
01:23:33.670 --> 01:23:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Where there's like a Cape Buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2041
01:23:35.271 --> 01:23:35.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2042
01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the macy says kill.</v>

2043
01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:40.300
<v Speaker 2>It just swings at end of the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes flying like 20 feet.</v>

2044
01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:42.790
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen the documentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>relentless enemies?</v>

2045
01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:44.820
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>

2046
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:49.990
<v Speaker 2>It's so good because it's about these</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines that adapted to only eat water</v>

2047
01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:53.830
<v Speaker 2>buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened was they had a change in</v>

2048
01:23:53.831 --> 01:23:56.860
<v Speaker 2>the current of the river,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed the course of a river and an</v>

2049
01:23:56.861 --> 01:24:01.861
<v Speaker 2>isolated this one island of lions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they only had two things to eat and one</v>

2050
01:24:02.711 --> 01:24:05.440
<v Speaker 2>of the things was Cape Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are fucking enormous,</v>

2051
01:24:05.441 --> 01:24:09.220
<v Speaker 2>so these lions became freakish mutan</v>
<v Speaker 2>lions,</v>

2052
01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.970
<v Speaker 2>enormous lions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the average female is the size of</v>

2053
01:24:12.971 --> 01:24:15.430
<v Speaker 2>an average male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>La and everywhere else in Africa,</v>

2054
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.000
<v Speaker 2>but google relentless enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant killer lions because the females</v>

2055
01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:22.510
<v Speaker 2>don't even look real.</v>

2056
01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:25.450
<v Speaker 2>They look like hulk lions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking Jack.</v>

2057
01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:28.240
<v Speaker 2>This is another reason I'm very</v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptical about this climate change</v>

2058
01:24:28.241 --> 01:24:31.180
<v Speaker 2>stuff because nature is far more</v>
<v Speaker 2>adaptable than we give it credit for.</v>

2059
01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean climate change in that?</v>

2060
01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Like the doom and gloom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if the temperature is that one</v>

2061
01:24:35.111 --> 01:24:38.080
<v Speaker 2>degree that the corals can't handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy it will move to Canada,</v>

2062
01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

2063
01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:42.020
<v Speaker 2>I love Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Toronto,</v>

2064
01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:44.500
<v Speaker 2>see if you get these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the ones going after it,</v>

2065
01:24:44.501 --> 01:24:48.610
<v Speaker 2>but see if you can get an image of some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the lions from relentless enemies</v>

2066
01:24:48.611 --> 01:24:51.430
<v Speaker 2>because they're just get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just Google it.</v>

2067
01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Go and look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't just keep popping these up on the</v>

2068
01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:57.310
<v Speaker 2>screen because there's some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go and look and find it,</v>

2069
01:24:57.311 --> 01:25:01.210
<v Speaker 2>you can find ones that are just jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's relentless enemies.</v>

2070
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:03.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but see if you can find like a good</v>

2071
01:25:03.101 --> 01:25:06.700
<v Speaker 2>image of the lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>right next to it.</v>

2072
01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:07.481
<v Speaker 2>That one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2073
01:25:07.481 --> 01:25:08.730
<v Speaker 2>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2074
01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:09.490
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're good.</v>

2075
01:25:09.490 --> 01:25:11.870
<v Speaker 2>There's some really good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some really good ones where they</v>

2076
01:25:11.871 --> 01:25:14.620
<v Speaker 2>look freakish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a good look at the size of that</v>

2077
01:25:14.621 --> 01:25:18.190
<v Speaker 2>fucker like that is so much bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the average female lion.</v>

2078
01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:20.050
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because they're.</v>

2079
01:25:20.051 --> 01:25:22.000
<v Speaker 2>All they're eating is east cape</v>
<v Speaker 2>buffaloes.</v>

2080
01:25:22.001 --> 01:25:26.230
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking enormous buffalo's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've grown to like 600 pounds for the</v>

2081
01:25:26.231 --> 01:25:29.140
<v Speaker 2>average female lion there are much</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>

2082
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:30.301
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2083
01:25:30.301 --> 01:25:31.570
<v Speaker 2>They're huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're.</v>

2084
01:25:31.730 --> 01:25:34.990
<v Speaker 2>They look so huge that even look real</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they still even this big.</v>

2085
01:25:34.991 --> 01:25:37.030
<v Speaker 2>They have to gang up on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

2086
01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:40.330
<v Speaker 2>jump on their back and one of them jumps</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the leg and I mean it's just.</v>

2087
01:25:40.570 --> 01:25:43.540
<v Speaker 2>But the documentary is amazing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly enough,</v>

2088
01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:48.490
<v Speaker 2>there's several prides of lion on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>one island and then not all that big.</v>

2089
01:25:48.491 --> 01:25:52.180
<v Speaker 2>It's just one pride is that big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other prides are like fairly normal</v>

2090
01:25:52.181 --> 01:25:53.960
<v Speaker 2>sized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one pride has.</v>

2091
01:25:53.961 --> 01:25:57.820
<v Speaker 2>It's just freakishly large species of</v>
<v Speaker 2>lion.</v>

2092
01:25:58.150 --> 01:25:59.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran through a lot of scenarios,</v>

2093
01:25:59.981 --> 01:26:01.240
<v Speaker 2>but what we're going to be talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

2094
01:26:01.241 --> 01:26:03.890
<v Speaker 2>and this was not one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't went</v>

2095
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:07.490
<v Speaker 3>through any scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I knew we were going to talk.</v>

2096
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.010
<v Speaker 3>We're sure about North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know.</v>

2097
01:26:10.011 --> 01:26:13.610
<v Speaker 3>We're going to talk about giant lines or</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic cuddle fish.</v>

2098
01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:15.230
<v Speaker 3>What's it called again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flamboyant.</v>

2099
01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.030
<v Speaker 3>Flamboyant cuttlefish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a perfect name.</v>

2100
01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2101
01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.990
<v Speaker 3>Why do they always use these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>Latin names?</v>

2102
01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Because that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this happens with when you into</v>

2103
01:26:23.331 --> 01:26:25.160
<v Speaker 3>aquariums,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm sending you something from</v>

2104
01:26:25.161 --> 01:26:27.200
<v Speaker 3>England to America or England to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cambodia,</v>

2105
01:26:27.201 --> 01:26:29.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're speaking the exact same species</v>

2106
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:32.570
<v Speaker 3>because what you might call a gray</v>
<v Speaker 3>parrot is not the same as what I would</v>

2107
01:26:32.571 --> 01:26:34.820
<v Speaker 3>call a great parent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

2108
01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:37.040
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting that he chose a dead</v>
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>

2109
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:38.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way it's universal.</v>

2110
01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:41.120
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

2111
01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:43.490
<v Speaker 3>Why don't just use English since we kick</v>
<v Speaker 3>ass?</v>

2112
01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:46.940
<v Speaker 3>Because</v>
<v Speaker 3>America</v>

2113
01:26:50.370 --> 01:26:52.580
<v Speaker 3>speak American and world American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

2114
01:26:52.581 --> 01:26:55.200
<v Speaker 3>those America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got a by England in this.</v>

2115
01:26:55.670 --> 01:26:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Just take over that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That name of the language.</v>

2116
01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Keep calling it English like enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>

2117
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:02.320
<v Speaker 3>You guys wouldn't be it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2118
01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.570
<v Speaker 3>You guys speak wrong and he spelled</v>
<v Speaker 3>tires wrong too.</v>

2119
01:27:05.690 --> 01:27:09.680
<v Speaker 3>I really think that they've evolved that</v>
<v Speaker 3>accent to come off as smarter than they</v>

2120
01:27:09.681 --> 01:27:11.750
<v Speaker 3>really are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Americans are smarter than</v>

2121
01:27:11.751 --> 01:27:14.820
<v Speaker 3>British people and it's a big lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's rude.</v>

2122
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:17.090
<v Speaker 3>You're racist against who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The British?</v>

2123
01:27:17.091 --> 01:27:18.770
<v Speaker 3>Yes are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all ugly.</v>

2124
01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:20.090
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2125
01:27:20.091 --> 01:27:23.060
<v Speaker 3>how dare you have not seen a sporty</v>
<v Speaker 3>spice?</v>

2126
01:27:23.730 --> 01:27:25.330
<v Speaker 3>She isn't she the hot one was the hot</v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

2127
01:27:25.630 --> 01:27:26.420
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty hot.</v>

2128
01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:29.660
<v Speaker 3>She's American and I decided the hot</v>
<v Speaker 3>ones are American,</v>

2129
01:27:30.170 --> 01:27:32.900
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's when you hear British people talk,</v>

2130
01:27:32.901 --> 01:27:35.510
<v Speaker 3>you think they're smart and you talk to</v>
<v Speaker 3>them like you're not that fucking smart.</v>

2131
01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:38.090
<v Speaker 3>You just stood accent Guy Ritchie's</v>
<v Speaker 3>really fucking smart.</v>

2132
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:39.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's one data point.</v>

2133
01:27:41.210 --> 01:27:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Madonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trolling.</v>

2134
01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:43.321
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

2135
01:27:43.321 --> 01:27:43.850
<v Speaker 3>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wait.</v>

2136
01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:46.160
<v Speaker 3>You read a lot of people from America</v>
<v Speaker 3>and English.</v>

2137
01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:48.350
<v Speaker 3>Do you think English people generally</v>
<v Speaker 3>smarter than Americans?</v>

2138
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:51.050
<v Speaker 3>I think that people vary widely.</v>

2139
01:27:53.130 --> 01:27:55.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you could still do a lot of really</v>

2140
01:27:55.101 --> 01:27:56.720
<v Speaker 3>dumb American people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

2141
01:27:56.721 --> 01:27:59.510
<v Speaker 3>a lot of really dumb American beat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's a lot of really dumb</v>

2142
01:27:59.511 --> 01:28:00.530
<v Speaker 3>British people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

2143
01:28:00.670 --> 01:28:01.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

2144
01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.770
<v Speaker 3>I never met him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone I met as a genius from England.</v>

2145
01:28:03.771 --> 01:28:04.730
<v Speaker 3>Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them.</v>

2146
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:08.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ritchie and sporty spice.</v>

2147
01:28:09.650 --> 01:28:11.390
<v Speaker 3>Sporty guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ritchie.</v>

2148
01:28:11.690 --> 01:28:12.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you haven't.</v>

2149
01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:15.080
<v Speaker 3>Madonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's a genius listener of Madonna's</v>

2150
01:28:15.081 --> 01:28:16.330
<v Speaker 3>English now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gave them.</v>

2151
01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:18.830
<v Speaker 3>We gave her away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the idea that you can with a</v>

2152
01:28:18.831 --> 01:28:21.210
<v Speaker 3>straight face just put makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a British accent.</v>

2153
01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.470
<v Speaker 3>You got to realize the kind of Dick that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guy Ritchie was slinging.</v>

2154
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:30.020
<v Speaker 3>He fucked her up so bad that she doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>work anymore and she speaks English.</v>

2155
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:34.700
<v Speaker 3>She barely even saying that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is stigmatized if I've ever seen</v>

2156
01:28:34.701 --> 01:28:37.640
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just laying that fucking lock stock</v>

<v Speaker 3>Are they.</v>

2158
01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Are they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're divorced though,</v>

2159
01:28:40.461 --> 01:28:40.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2161
01:28:41.511 --> 01:28:43.760
<v Speaker 3>But she's still fucked up from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was really fucked up.</v>

2162
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:46.220
<v Speaker 3>He's recovered greatly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's really like,</v>

2163
01:28:46.590 --> 01:28:47.660
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a mess.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She's got like those tweety birds for</v>
<v Speaker 3>cartoons</v>

2165
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:57.200
<v Speaker 3>was</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universal thing for somebody fucked</v>

2166
01:28:57.201 --> 01:28:58.560
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Birds would circled it.</v>

2168
01:29:04.741 --> 01:29:06.660
<v Speaker 3>with a frying pan and we'd see those</v>

<v Speaker 3>tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tweet,</v>

2171
01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:10.470
<v Speaker 3>and where are you going to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2172
01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:13.710
<v Speaker 3>That got fucked up and I think she's got</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mix of those birds and cuckoo clocks.</v>

2173
01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's got to be hard,</v>

2174
01:29:16.021 --> 01:29:18.450
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're like a sex symbol for women</v>

2175
01:29:18.451 --> 01:29:21.720
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this weird phase that women go</v>

2176
01:29:21.721 --> 01:29:23.550
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very disturbing.</v>

2177
01:29:23.551 --> 01:29:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Everyone except Christie Brinkley who</v>
<v Speaker 3>had still.</v>

2178
01:29:25.231 --> 01:29:26.280
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

2179
01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:27.960
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No disrespect,</v>

2180
01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:30.540
<v Speaker 3>but she's like in her sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's still hot,</v>

2181
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:33.180
<v Speaker 3>but every other woman who's like really</v>
<v Speaker 3>hot,</v>

2182
01:29:33.210 --> 01:29:36.840
<v Speaker 3>when she was in her twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get to this certain age and either</v>

2183
01:29:36.841 --> 01:29:41.841
<v Speaker 3>they let it go like Meryl Streep and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just accept an age gracefully or they</v>

2184
01:29:42.211 --> 01:29:45.590
<v Speaker 3>start shooting a bunch of shit in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>face and they get real weird looking.</v>

2185
01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they just become like a monster and</v>

2186
01:29:48.901 --> 01:29:53.550
<v Speaker 3>so they go from being extremely</v>
<v Speaker 3>desirable to repulsive the uncanny</v>

2187
01:29:53.551 --> 01:29:55.770
<v Speaker 3>valley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Uncanny Valley of deals with</v>

2188
01:29:55.771 --> 01:29:58.200
<v Speaker 3>software,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it deals with like when robots look</v>

2189
01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.120
<v Speaker 3>too close to human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's repulsive,</v>

2190
01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:02.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Artificial intelligence,</v>

2191
01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.010
<v Speaker 3>what they use artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a virtual reality.</v>

2192
01:30:05.011 --> 01:30:06.990
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the point is someone has to look</v>

2193
01:30:06.991 --> 01:30:08.880
<v Speaker 3>like a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not too much like a person who has</v>

2194
01:30:08.881 --> 01:30:10.350
<v Speaker 3>this creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they become like,</v>

2195
01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:11.880
<v Speaker 3>you look human almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2196
01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.920
<v Speaker 3>So then it becomes very repellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2197
01:30:13.921 --> 01:30:16.410
<v Speaker 3>that's what's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's tweaky about.</v>

2198
01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:21.030
<v Speaker 3>We went to Nvidia a few years back when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing this Scifi show and this</v>

2199
01:30:21.031 --> 01:30:25.290
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say 2012 or 13 where they were</v>

2200
01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:30.320
<v Speaker 3>just getting good at this virtual</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality software and the reproduction of</v>

2201
01:30:31.021 --> 01:30:32.790
<v Speaker 3>the human body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they couldn't get eyelashes</v>

2202
01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:33.643
<v Speaker 3>downright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2203
01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:36.080
<v Speaker 3>like blinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was weird like that.</v>

2204
01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:38.140
<v Speaker 3>So you'd watched this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom,</v>

2205
01:30:38.150 --> 01:30:40.200
<v Speaker 3>like there was something weird about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>blinking,</v>

2206
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:43.440
<v Speaker 3>trying to give you a message and code.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking bizarre.</v>

2207
01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:46.720
<v Speaker 3>Like wasn't there some Vietnam hostage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>American POW.</v>

2208
01:30:46.721 --> 01:30:47.910
<v Speaker 3>It's blinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sos.</v>

2209
01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:49.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that?</v>

2210
01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:52.020
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what I think it was that</v>
<v Speaker 3>POW two,</v>

2211
01:30:52.050 --> 01:30:52.621
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

2212
01:30:52.621 --> 01:30:53.180
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2214
01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:57.360

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2215
01:30:57.690 --> 01:30:59.250
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

<v Speaker 3>got tortured be unbelief.</v>

2217
01:31:02.670 --> 01:31:04.440
<v Speaker 3>While that was something I was reading</v>
<v Speaker 3>about China,</v>

2218
01:31:04.441 --> 01:31:08.640
<v Speaker 3>about how many CIA operatives in China</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been killed over the last two years?</v>

2219
01:31:08.641 --> 01:31:09.910
<v Speaker 3>Like 18.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>or jailed over the last couple of years</v>

2222
01:31:16.051 --> 01:31:19.680
<v Speaker 3>and they were complaining we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't fucking spy on them anymore.</v>

2223
01:31:19.710 --> 01:31:20.543
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like they don't want you spying like to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get it,</v>

2225
01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:28.050
<v Speaker 3>but with the way we look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're allowed a spy.</v>

2226
01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:30.340
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't be killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>

2227

<v Speaker 3>There's something entirely terrifying</v>

2234
01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:00.820
<v Speaker 3>about watching someone who is a prisoner</v>
<v Speaker 3>of war.</v>

2235
01:32:01.090 --> 01:32:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when John Mccain has these racist</v>

2236
01:32:03.731 --> 01:32:05.380
<v Speaker 3>quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get it pass.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You can't lift your hands over your</v>

2240
01:32:09.101 --> 01:32:09.610
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

<v Speaker 3>him hanging by his wrist.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying it's okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>was plant stems in a pill form.</v>

2267
01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Wonder like if John Mccain's ever tried</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do anything about his shoulders or if</v>

2272
01:33:18.611 --> 01:33:21.610
<v Speaker 3>makes a whole lot of sense and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people will like totally down for him</v>

<v Speaker 3>being the fucking president.</v>

2281
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:48.700
<v Speaker 3>When she came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had,</v>

2282
01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:51.640
<v Speaker 3>when she was nominated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had the highest approval rating of</v>

2283
01:33:51.641 --> 01:33:54.420
<v Speaker 3>any governor in America and her first</v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalist speeches.</v>

<v Speaker 3>this lady is a ball buster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then interview hit and you're like,</v>

2286
01:33:57.521 --> 01:33:59.190
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't read.</v>

2287
01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:00.010
<v Speaker 3>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's.</v>

2288
01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:02.580
<v Speaker 3>She's like had learning disabled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2289
01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:03.820
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't know if she's learned to</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2290
01:34:03.821 --> 01:34:05.860
<v Speaker 3>but I just don't think she's interested</v>
<v Speaker 3>in learning.</v>

2291
01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:09.550
<v Speaker 3>I read her book and it was really</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

2292
01:34:09.551 --> 01:34:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Or You read her book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only so many hours in a day.</v>

2293
01:34:12.490 --> 01:34:15.310
<v Speaker 3>How many days in a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many years in your life that can read</v>

2294
01:34:15.311 --> 01:34:17.920
<v Speaker 3>North Korean propaganda could read this</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's this one point in the book</v>

2295
01:34:17.921 --> 01:34:19.660
<v Speaker 3>where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her ghost writer should be fired because</v>

2296
01:34:19.690 --> 01:34:20.590
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her daughter,</v>

2297
01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.350
<v Speaker 3>willow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever goes to her,</v>

2298
01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:25.390
<v Speaker 3>mommy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you ever cry?</v>

2299
01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:27.310
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a murder mystery.</v>

2300
01:34:27.311 --> 01:34:30.100
<v Speaker 3>That's how you know she's a sociopath</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's in the book.</v>

2301
01:34:30.101 --> 01:34:30.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

2302
01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:33.040
<v Speaker 3>that's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mommy's too dumb to cry.</v>

2303
01:34:33.190 --> 01:34:35.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mommy's just don't understand sadness.</v>

2304
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:38.140
<v Speaker 3>It's just skin over wires and circuitry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

2305
01:34:38.141 --> 01:34:39.520
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see that.</v>

2306
01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:42.670
<v Speaker 3>I just saw her as being adored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2307
01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:44.590
<v Speaker 3>like it came out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>

2308
01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:47.500
<v Speaker 3>just like with George W Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you remember the first 2000,</v>

2309
01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:50.440
<v Speaker 3>he won those debates against Gore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least held his own and then there</v>

2310
01:34:50.441 --> 01:34:52.720
<v Speaker 3>was just declined to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not even speak English.</v>

2311
01:34:53.110 --> 01:34:54.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you remember when George Bush was</v>

2312
01:34:54.701 --> 01:34:56.290
<v Speaker 3>running for Governor of Texas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now?</v>

2313
01:34:56.291 --> 01:34:56.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2314
01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have noticed that I'm from</v>

2315
01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:58.791
<v Speaker 2>New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2316
01:34:58.791 --> 01:35:00.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why I remember is because</v>

2317
01:35:00.951 --> 01:35:05.260
<v Speaker 2>they show the stark contrast between his</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to communicate while he was</v>

2318
01:35:05.261 --> 01:35:08.570
<v Speaker 2>running for governor versus his ability</v>
<v Speaker 2>to communicate once it became president.</v>

2319
01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:14.140
<v Speaker 2>I felt like he was almost like a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 2>had all his responsibility taken away</v>

2320
01:35:14.841 --> 01:35:19.010
<v Speaker 2>from him and he just like atrophied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Dick Cheney was kinda running the</v>

2321
01:35:19.011 --> 01:35:24.011
<v Speaker 2>show and he was just sitting back</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking up lines and making mistakes</v>

2322
01:35:24.531 --> 01:35:27.200
<v Speaker 2>with things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you watch the speeches that he</v>

2323
01:35:27.201 --> 01:35:28.880
<v Speaker 2>gave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kid will play this</v>

2324
01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:34.230
<v Speaker 5>a perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that the mission in education</v>

2325
01:35:35.110 --> 01:35:36.270
<v Speaker 5>and literature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>math,</v>

2326
01:35:36.271 --> 01:35:40.560
<v Speaker 5>science and social science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's still different to enrich beyond</v>

2327
01:35:40.561 --> 01:35:41.670
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more power to them.</v>

2328
01:35:41.671 --> 01:35:41.900
<v Speaker 5>But yeah.</v>

2329
01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:42.980
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a different person.</v>

2330
01:35:42.981 --> 01:35:44.370
<v Speaker 2>We all know it gets better.</v>

2331
01:35:44.570 --> 01:35:47.180
<v Speaker 5>Four subject matters and see if we can</v>
<v Speaker 5>do it right.</v>

2332
01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:51.200
<v Speaker 5>We ought to determine the cost per pupil</v>
<v Speaker 5>necessary to achieve excellence in the</v>

2333
01:35:51.201 --> 01:35:54.620
<v Speaker 5>classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we all to funded the funding</v>

2334
01:35:54.621 --> 01:35:58.100
<v Speaker 5>priority of the state of Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the school children of our state.</v>

2335
01:35:58.101 --> 01:36:00.620
<v Speaker 5>And it has not been under the past four</v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

2336
01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.980
<v Speaker 5>The state share of education has</v>
<v Speaker 5>decreased to 44 percent.</v>

2337
01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:08.540
<v Speaker 5>That is why we have property taxes on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rise and nearly every single school</v>

2338
01:36:08.541 --> 01:36:09.210
<v Speaker 5>district in</v>

2339
01:36:09.210 --> 01:36:10.043
<v Speaker 2>stable</v>

2340
01:36:10.630 --> 01:36:14.090
<v Speaker 5>defined the mission determine the cost</v>
<v Speaker 5>per pupil necessarily.</v>

2341
01:36:14.190 --> 01:36:15.980
<v Speaker 2>You see reading from the teleprompter</v>
<v Speaker 2>elected government.</v>

2342
01:36:15.981 --> 01:36:16.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly not</v>

2343
01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:20.520
<v Speaker 5>say that the number one funding priority</v>
<v Speaker 5>of our state will be the schoolchildren</v>

2344
01:36:20.530 --> 01:36:21.363
<v Speaker 5>of Texas.</v>

2345
01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing and compare George Bush 10 years</v>

2346
01:36:25.061 --> 01:36:28.060
<v Speaker 2>ago to George Bush today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now so that in the video it says this,</v>

2347
01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:28.993
<v Speaker 2>listen to them now.</v>

2348
01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:34.550
<v Speaker 5>Awesome</v>
<v Speaker 5>for dealing with nuclear proliferation,</v>

2349
01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:38.270
<v Speaker 5>about 35 percent since I've been the</v>
<v Speaker 5>president.</v>

2350
01:36:38.770 --> 01:36:39.650
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Secondly,</v>

2351
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:42.200
<v Speaker 5>we set up what's called the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well first of all,</v>

2352
01:36:42.201 --> 01:36:45.440
<v Speaker 5>I agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My opponent that the biggest threat</v>

2353
01:36:46.130 --> 01:36:49.040
<v Speaker 5>facing this country is there a weapons</v>
<v Speaker 5>of mass destruction in the hands of a</v>

2354
01:36:49.041 --> 01:36:49.874
<v Speaker 5>terrorist network.</v>

2355
01:36:50.250 --> 01:36:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was clear and concise,</v>

2356
01:36:51.661 --> 01:36:54.320
<v Speaker 2>but he was also a younger man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to realize like,</v>

2357
01:36:54.330 --> 01:36:58.890
<v Speaker 2>this is an older man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's tired and the grind of being the</v>

2358
01:36:58.891 --> 01:37:03.120
<v Speaker 2>president for four years was wearing on</v>
<v Speaker 2>him so hard when he was running against</v>

2359
01:37:03.121 --> 01:37:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Kerry there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2360
01:37:04.381 --> 01:37:08.760
<v Speaker 2>he was just a beaten man and I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that job is just unbelievably</v>

2361
01:37:08.761 --> 01:37:11.730
<v Speaker 2>draining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some sort of a psychic vampire just</v>

2362
01:37:11.731 --> 01:37:15.450
<v Speaker 2>locks onto you and saps you of all your</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Mitochondria.</v>

2363
01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:17.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have an excuse because his</v>

2364
01:37:17.041 --> 01:37:19.140
<v Speaker 2>dad was president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he would have known what it's like</v>

2365
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:21.810
<v Speaker 2>maybe his dad was only president for</v>
<v Speaker 2>four years now only.</v>

2366
01:37:21.811 --> 01:37:22.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

2367
01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:24.090
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to be a short four</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2368
01:37:24.150 --> 01:37:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his dad was the head of the CIA for</v>

2369
01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:28.920
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his dad was maybe more deeply</v>

2370
01:37:28.921 --> 01:37:31.560
<v Speaker 2>entrenched in the ideas of politics than</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>

2371
01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:34.400
<v Speaker 2>And I met his uncle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Gail with a friend of mine who</v>

2372
01:37:34.401 --> 01:37:37.400
<v Speaker 2>was doing a masters t and that guy I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>ready to go out,</v>

2373
01:37:37.470 --> 01:37:39.180
<v Speaker 2>come out swinging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was going to be a troll.</v>

2374
01:37:39.210 --> 01:37:42.000
<v Speaker 2>That guy charmed the fucking pants off</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and I'm like,</v>

2375
01:37:42.001 --> 01:37:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see why these people are in power</v>

2376
01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:46.500
<v Speaker 2>one on one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are so charming,</v>

2377
01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.920
<v Speaker 2>will win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeb was running for president,</v>

2378
01:37:48.930 --> 01:37:51.330
<v Speaker 2>so I almost felt like he was thrown in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the towel.</v>

2379
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:53.820
<v Speaker 2>I felt like he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to go through the motions</v>

2380
01:37:53.821 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 2>and fuck some of this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like</v>

2381
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:59.100
<v Speaker 3>Rick Perry when Rick Perry was like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's something I forgot.</v>

2382
01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>

2383
01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:02.850
<v Speaker 3>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you say Jeb Bush is tweet when he,</v>

2384
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:04.050
<v Speaker 3>when he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he quit,</v>

2385
01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:05.520
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry mom.</v>

2386
01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:07.860
<v Speaker 3>That was his tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jabba tweeted this out.</v>

2387
01:38:07.861 --> 01:38:09.000
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2388
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:10.830
<v Speaker 3>His mom's probably secretly happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2389
01:38:10.831 --> 01:38:12.270
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she didn't want him to run Barbara.</v>

2390
01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:14.820
<v Speaker 3>She said that publicly before he</v>
<v Speaker 3>announced.</v>

2391
01:38:14.821 --> 01:38:15.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

2392
01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:17.810
<v Speaker 3>enough tooth and two is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2393
01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:19.140
<v Speaker 3>it's a monarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2394
01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:23.830
<v Speaker 3>What's also crazy to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would he want to do it at that?</v>

2395
01:38:24.050 --> 01:38:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who the hell knows why does anybody want</v>

2396
01:38:26.881 --> 01:38:28.920
<v Speaker 3>to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he seemed to be like the least</v>

2397
01:38:28.921 --> 01:38:32.490
<v Speaker 3>qualified of album.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will trump's the least qualified in the</v>

2398
01:38:32.491 --> 01:38:33.291
<v Speaker 3>bushes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2399
01:38:33.291 --> 01:38:34.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as far as his ability to</v>

2400
01:38:34.471 --> 01:38:36.080
<v Speaker 3>communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like the worst of it.</v>

2401
01:38:36.090 --> 01:38:37.060
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Jeb,</v>

2402
01:38:37.170 --> 01:38:39.480
<v Speaker 3>in 1996,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>

2403
01:38:39.481 --> 01:38:41.670
<v Speaker 3>he ran for reelection against this guy.</v>

2404
01:38:41.670 --> 01:38:43.470
<v Speaker 3>I forgot his name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Baylor bend something.</v>

2405
01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:48.060
<v Speaker 3>And they were tied and then they had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>debate and Jeb crushed him so bad that</v>

2406
01:38:48.061 --> 01:38:50.970
<v Speaker 3>he ended up winning by double digits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Guy who'd be generating in the</v>

2407
01:38:50.971 --> 01:38:52.590
<v Speaker 3>primaries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was bill mcbride,</v>

2408
01:38:52.591 --> 01:38:54.390
<v Speaker 3>I think is his name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was for Florida?</v>

2409
01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was reelected.</v>

2410
01:38:55.741 --> 01:38:58.100
<v Speaker 3>Governor of Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was a beast again,</v>

2411
01:38:58.110 --> 01:39:01.140
<v Speaker 3>back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have these debates and he's</v>

2412
01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:03.060
<v Speaker 3>standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2413
01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:05.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was hilarious too.</v>

2414
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:06.890
<v Speaker 3>I think he just didn't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing was like,</v>

2415
01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:09.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't think fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think any of them have ever</v>

2416
01:39:09.871 --> 01:39:13.620
<v Speaker 3>known what to do with a trump figure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially who's leading them.</v>

2417
01:39:13.650 --> 01:39:15.510
<v Speaker 3>And when the guy's been trump's on stage</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

2418
01:39:15.511 --> 01:39:18.270
<v Speaker 3>this guy's a real sick guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said he was going to pull down his</v>

2419
01:39:18.271 --> 01:39:20.010
<v Speaker 3>pants and moon everyone.</v>

2420
01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:22.290
<v Speaker 3>And Jeff's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you say to that?</v>

2421
01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:24.010
<v Speaker 3>Is that what trump says?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2422
01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:29.250
<v Speaker 3>And</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be really fascinating if Alec</v>

2423
01:39:29.250 --> 01:39:31.470
<v Speaker 3>Baldwin ran against trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think he's gonna run?</v>

2424
01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:32.393
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2425
01:39:32.490 --> 01:39:36.270
<v Speaker 3>But it would be fascinating because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy who not only did trump on</v>

2426
01:39:36.271 --> 01:39:39.990
<v Speaker 3>Syrah live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is more than capable of holding his</v>

2427
01:39:39.991 --> 01:39:44.660
<v Speaker 3>own and that kind of a fist to cuff sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a debate like if he,</v>

2428
01:39:44.661 --> 01:39:47.100
<v Speaker 3>if it insults being thrown back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>forth,</v>

2429
01:39:47.101 --> 01:39:48.810
<v Speaker 3>and that kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told us a great [inaudible] you</v>

2430
01:39:48.811 --> 01:39:51.960
<v Speaker 3>remember when Alec Baldwin lost the Shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reporter and called him a fag</v>

2431
01:39:51.961 --> 01:39:53.400
<v Speaker 3>and all this other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember this.</v>

2432
01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:56.460
<v Speaker 3>So Alec was that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it wasn't that guy a popper off to</v>

2433
01:39:56.490 --> 01:39:58.560
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point is he's taking pictures of his</v>

2434
01:39:58.561 --> 01:40:00.090
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got emotionally worked up,</v>

2435
01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:03.510
<v Speaker 3>he's got thin skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not in those,</v>

2436
01:40:03.690 --> 01:40:04.350
<v Speaker 3>in those debates.</v>

2437
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:05.660
<v Speaker 3>Trump knows how to swing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2438
01:40:05.670 --> 01:40:07.740
<v Speaker 3>But Alec Baldwin's never been in debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point is,</v>

2439
01:40:07.741 --> 01:40:10.680
<v Speaker 3>if Alec Baldwin loses his shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's trying to present himself as the</v>

2440
01:40:10.681 --> 01:40:13.890
<v Speaker 3>same of alternative to this lunatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if they're both saying they're both</v>

2441
01:40:13.891 --> 01:40:16.350
<v Speaker 3>fucking lunatics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was baldwins advantage?</v>

2442
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:20.610
<v Speaker 3>Better looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not nearly as power hungry,</v>

2443
01:40:20.730 --> 01:40:25.730
<v Speaker 3>not a billionaire oligarch type.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone thought trump was power hungry?</v>

2444
01:40:25.981 --> 01:40:30.330
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't the knock against him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they definitely thought it was money</v>

2445
01:40:30.331 --> 01:40:31.560
<v Speaker 3>hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>

2446
01:40:31.561 --> 01:40:34.380
<v Speaker 3>but like Ted Cruz came up as much more</v>
<v Speaker 3>power hungry.</v>

2447
01:40:34.381 --> 01:40:37.920
<v Speaker 3>I think that trump did well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Ted Cruz was kind of sunk by those</v>

2448
01:40:37.921 --> 01:40:42.450
<v Speaker 3>weird commercial out clips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We the outtakes where you got to see</v>

2449
01:40:42.451 --> 01:40:43.770
<v Speaker 3>them Redo it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2450
01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:47.250
<v Speaker 3>I remember when he said it was my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was my mother play prays for me for</v>

2451
01:40:47.251 --> 01:40:51.420
<v Speaker 3>an hour everyday and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his daughter wouldn't kiss him.</v>

2452
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:53.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His daughter wouldn't kiss ever.</v>

2453
01:40:53.610 --> 01:40:54.340
<v Speaker 3>There was awkward</v>

2454
01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:56.560
<v Speaker 1>hugs and they had a redo takes and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2455
01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:59.230
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite thing during the primaries</v>

2456
01:40:59.231 --> 01:41:01.990
<v Speaker 1>was ted Cruz's regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the best debater in Washington.</v>

2457
01:41:01.991 --> 01:41:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Izzy?</v>

2458
01:41:02.770 --> 01:41:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all respect him that he was like,</v>

2459
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:06.580
<v Speaker 1>it has this long debate history from</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>

2460
01:41:06.630 --> 01:41:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Harvard or Yale or where he went to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this guy could practice for 100</v>

2461
01:41:10.391 --> 01:41:13.540
<v Speaker 1>years with 100 different fake opponents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that time,</v>

2462
01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.430
<v Speaker 1>no one would ever think of throwing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2463
01:41:15.730 --> 01:41:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Your Dad Shot Jfk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that about?</v>

2464
01:41:21.370 --> 01:41:24.790
<v Speaker 1>How about the Zodiac killer shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kept calling the Zodiac cat.</v>

2465
01:41:25.130 --> 01:41:28.960
<v Speaker 1>That's the green frog approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the green frog effect.</v>

2466
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wonderful trolls.</v>

2467
01:41:30.670 --> 01:41:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I started calling Hillary America's</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother-in-law and that caught on a bit</v>

2468
01:41:34.751 --> 01:41:37.990
<v Speaker 1>and that's how you have to take down</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people is not through their ideas,</v>

2469
01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:41.590
<v Speaker 1>but just kind of take their strengths</v>
<v Speaker 1>and turn them into weaknesses.</v>

2470
01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:44.470
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember there was a real clear moment</v>

2471
01:41:44.471 --> 01:41:48.190
<v Speaker 1>during the campaign were Ted Cruz had</v>
<v Speaker 1>not yet stepped away,</v>

2472
01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:48.710
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

2473
01:41:48.710 --> 01:41:49.870
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not yet resigned,</v>

2474
01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:54.430
<v Speaker 1>but there was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was at a speech and somehow or</v>

2475
01:41:54.431 --> 01:41:58.150
<v Speaker 1>another some trump supporter was in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>front row wearing sunglasses,</v>

2476
01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:02.080
<v Speaker 1>telling them to quit and calling them</v>
<v Speaker 1>lying Ted and saying,</v>

2477
01:42:02.090 --> 01:42:03.760
<v Speaker 1>you've already lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When are you going to quit?</v>

2478
01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:08.170
<v Speaker 1>And he was trying to engage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy was outside and I was like,</v>

2479
01:42:08.171 --> 01:42:09.520
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's fucked up.</v>

2480
01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:11.650
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know how to deal with like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real person.</v>

2481
01:42:11.710 --> 01:42:14.560
<v Speaker 1>What about when he had fear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rena as his running mate and she follows</v>

2482
01:42:14.561 --> 01:42:18.190
<v Speaker 1>up the stage at their announcement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like this curb your enthusiasm</v>

2483
01:42:18.191 --> 01:42:19.330
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

2484
01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:21.670
<v Speaker 1>How is this ever going to turn it</v>
<v Speaker 1>around?</v>

2485
01:42:21.671 --> 01:42:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you anticipate happening?</v>

2486
01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:27.760
<v Speaker 1>My whole 2020,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hope is that the gears of government</v>

2487
01:42:27.761 --> 01:42:31.660
<v Speaker 1>are going to be increasingly shut down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that political communication becomes</v>

2488
01:42:31.661 --> 01:42:34.120
<v Speaker 1>impossible and we start breaking this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff apart.</v>

2489
01:42:34.150 --> 01:42:35.680
<v Speaker 1>That's my goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't you?</v>

2490
01:42:35.681 --> 01:42:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think it will take like</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever to come up with some new sort of</v>

2491
01:42:39.250 --> 01:42:42.290
<v Speaker 1>structure to run this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we need to angled con.</v>

2492
01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we need a structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the structures in place</v>

2493
01:42:45.371 --> 01:42:49.240
<v Speaker 1>that most of the interaction you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>between humans is already there with</v>

2494
01:42:49.241 --> 01:42:50.830
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have any structure here for me</v>

2495
01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:51.790
<v Speaker 1>to get here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2496
01:42:51.791 --> 01:42:54.220
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think we're gonna need much</v>
<v Speaker 1>replacing.</v>

2497
01:42:54.490 --> 01:42:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2498
01:42:55.050 --> 01:42:58.720
<v Speaker 1>but there's no way that the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in the positions of power right now,</v>

2499
01:42:58.721 --> 01:43:00.850
<v Speaker 1>whether there'll be senators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>republican congressmen,</v>

2500
01:43:00.851 --> 01:43:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats,</v>

2501
01:43:01.871 --> 01:43:03.130
<v Speaker 1>whoever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>

2502
01:43:03.131 --> 01:43:05.510
<v Speaker 1>They're just going to accept the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the structure doesn't exist in.</v>

2503
01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way to do that as technology.</v>

2504
01:43:07.601 --> 01:43:09.610
<v Speaker 1>And here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an example I always use like</v>

2505
01:43:09.611 --> 01:43:11.320
<v Speaker 1>let's suppose it's 1980,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2506
01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:14.140
<v Speaker 1>And me and you are technologically</v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced.</v>

2507
01:43:14.141 --> 01:43:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Humans have walked on the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2508
01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:18.340
<v Speaker 1>we have mobile phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on and so forth and you and I are</v>

2509
01:43:18.341 --> 01:43:22.120
<v Speaker 1>having an argument about censorship and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying we need to censor some</v>

2510
01:43:22.121 --> 01:43:24.400
<v Speaker 1>things might come for child pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2511
01:43:24.401 --> 01:43:28.330
<v Speaker 1>we have to have free speech and Jamie</v>
<v Speaker 1>appears from 2017 and he goes,</v>

2512
01:43:28.331 --> 01:43:32.800
<v Speaker 1>you guys are wasting your time because</v>
<v Speaker 1>soon you will be able to copy any book</v>

2513
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:36.820
<v Speaker 1>with one button and with one button you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can send it anywhere on earth at the</v>

2514
01:43:36.821 --> 01:43:38.440
<v Speaker 1>speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much does it cost?</v>

2515
01:43:38.441 --> 01:43:41.380
<v Speaker 1>It's free and if you have to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>magic words to other people can read</v>

2516
01:43:41.381 --> 01:43:43.600
<v Speaker 1>this books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A censorship is technically impossible.</v>

2517
01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:45.520
<v Speaker 1>You would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would both look at him like he's</v>

2518
01:43:45.521 --> 01:43:46.690
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what's happened.</v>

2519
01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:51.830
<v Speaker 1>So technology is increasingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm binding the hands of government.</v>

2520
01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.520
<v Speaker 1>When we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that apple with apple didn't</v>

2521
01:43:55.521 --> 01:43:57.740
<v Speaker 1>exist then maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the apple would tell the government,</v>

2522
01:43:57.950 --> 01:44:02.570
<v Speaker 1>we're making a lock on our phones that</v>
<v Speaker 1>even we can't open because we understand</v>

2523
01:44:02.571 --> 01:44:05.150
<v Speaker 1>that you are the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would have been unthinkable.</v>

2524
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:08.630
<v Speaker 1>And now we have corporations openly</v>
<v Speaker 1>defying the state because they realized</v>

2525
01:44:08.631 --> 01:44:11.450
<v Speaker 1>that they are often the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's wonderful.</v>

2526
01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Uber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2527
01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:14.840
<v Speaker 1>his whole model is we're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna ask for forgiveness,</v>

2528
01:44:14.841 --> 01:44:17.900
<v Speaker 1>not permission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to break the law until you</v>

2529
01:44:17.901 --> 01:44:20.510
<v Speaker 1>guys say it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to have licensing.</v>

2530
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:24.940
<v Speaker 1>It's great and we're going to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrenched in the city until you know,</v>

2531
01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:27.170
<v Speaker 1>then you can't get us out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then someone might lift,</v>

2532
01:44:27.171 --> 01:44:28.490
<v Speaker 1>comes along and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2533
01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:29.750
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not doing it.</v>

2534
01:44:29.751 --> 01:44:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2535
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2536
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:33.890
<v Speaker 1>And then that's the spirit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

2537
01:44:34.150 --> 01:44:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful thing.</v>

2538
01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I just wonder how that applies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

2539
01:44:37.930 --> 01:44:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if the government's hands are</v>

2540
01:44:39.771 --> 01:44:43.430
<v Speaker 1>tied with religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people are going to negotiate</v>

2541
01:44:43.431 --> 01:44:46.820
<v Speaker 1>through piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like we do now.</v>

2542
01:44:46.821 --> 01:44:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Like I mean if you have a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>macy's,</v>

2543
01:44:48.381 --> 01:44:50.330
<v Speaker 1>you either return the sweater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take the loss,</v>

2544
01:44:50.331 --> 01:44:51.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

2545
01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:54.680
<v Speaker 1>But how does that play out though in</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a real life scenario?</v>

2546
01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:58.580
<v Speaker 1>I think what's going to have to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just like with books and books,</v>

2547
01:44:58.581 --> 01:45:00.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can go anywhere or at the speed of</v>

2548
01:45:00.051 --> 01:45:02.180
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you have people being able to move</v>

2549
01:45:02.181 --> 01:45:05.360
<v Speaker 1>very quickly from place to place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to start becoming</v>

2550
01:45:05.361 --> 01:45:06.440
<v Speaker 1>effectively the</v>

2551
01:45:07.210 --> 01:45:10.630
<v Speaker 1>property of whatever country they happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in because right now we have</v>

2552
01:45:10.631 --> 01:45:14.160
<v Speaker 1>things divided by geography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you have your have landline</v>

2553
01:45:14.170 --> 01:45:17.690
<v Speaker 1>technology when it comes to government</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a in a cell phone world or even a</v>

2554
01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:20.860
<v Speaker 1>beyond cell phone world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had it where I'm the government</v>

2555
01:45:20.861 --> 01:45:23.920
<v Speaker 1>or whatever cell phone provider I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would carry with me if I'm in</v>

2556
01:45:23.921 --> 01:45:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan or Russia or the United States as</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to when I'm in the between these</v>

2557
01:45:28.361 --> 01:45:30.700
<v Speaker 1>two oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's US law when I'm in between these</v>

2558
01:45:30.701 --> 01:45:31.870
<v Speaker 1>two oceans is British law.</v>

2559
01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:36.710
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that in the future we'll</v>

2560
01:45:36.711 --> 01:45:41.711
<v Speaker 1>see like a dissolving of borders for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to travel back that I think a</v>

2561
01:45:42.081 --> 01:45:43.970
<v Speaker 1>lot of people support that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>already started happening.</v>

2562
01:45:44.210 --> 01:45:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

2563
01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:46.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like right now,</v>

2564
01:45:46.071 --> 01:45:49.100
<v Speaker 1>I could go any country on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including North Korea right now,</v>

2565
01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:50.570
<v Speaker 1>let's listen to case a hundred years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

2566
01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:54.800
<v Speaker 1>this trump thing that got him elected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things was build that wall,</v>

2567
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:56.050
<v Speaker 1>build that wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2568
01:45:56.090 --> 01:45:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that this is like a retro</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea or an idea of like almost like a</v>

2569
01:45:59.301 --> 01:46:03.620
<v Speaker 1>longing for nostalgia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pushing back against technology,</v>

2570
01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:06.860
<v Speaker 1>pushing back against progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think it's the pushing forward for the</v>

2571
01:46:06.861 --> 01:46:11.150
<v Speaker 1>idea of self segregation and the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should surround yourself with</v>

2572
01:46:11.151 --> 01:46:14.120
<v Speaker 1>people that you choose as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you are forced to surround</v>

2573
01:46:14.121 --> 01:46:18.290
<v Speaker 1>yourself with and that people are pack</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and I shouldn't have to.</v>

2574
01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:20.810
<v Speaker 1>The idea that me and my neighbors in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>building,</v>

2575
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:23.060
<v Speaker 1>I get to sit down and make a consensus</v>
<v Speaker 1>is bullshit.</v>

2576
01:46:23.061 --> 01:46:25.130
<v Speaker 1>I want to sit down with my friends and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a consensus.</v>

2577
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what you're talking about.</v>

2578
01:46:26.391 --> 01:46:28.920
<v Speaker 1>The whole entire United States though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the building,</v>

2579
01:46:28.921 --> 01:46:31.490
<v Speaker 1>the wall between us and Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point seems to me that they're</v>

2580
01:46:31.491 --> 01:46:33.860
<v Speaker 1>just wanting to keep out the unfortunate</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2581
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also want to keep themselves as a</v>

2582
01:46:35.661 --> 01:46:36.830
<v Speaker 1>cohesive whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2583
01:46:36.831 --> 01:46:38.840
<v Speaker 1>so they want to maintain this idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americanness,</v>

2584
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:41.420
<v Speaker 1>whereas they're being told that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americanists means everyone on earth can</v>

2585
01:46:41.421 --> 01:46:43.580
<v Speaker 1>come here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2586
01:46:43.581 --> 01:46:45.170
<v Speaker 1>they're not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just saying.</v>

2587
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean no one's really saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody can come here.</v>

2588
01:46:47.511 --> 01:46:49.440
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're going to what?</v>

2589
01:46:49.590 --> 01:46:52.560
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard any criteria for saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't let this group in.</v>

2590
01:46:52.890 --> 01:46:55.740
<v Speaker 1>There's always some reason for letting</v>
<v Speaker 1>each and every group in and there's</v>

2591
01:46:55.741 --> 01:46:56.940
<v Speaker 1>never a reason to say no.</v>

2592
01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:59.010
<v Speaker 1>While the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rational filter would be,</v>

2593
01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:02.730
<v Speaker 1>we don't want anyone in here that has an</v>
<v Speaker 1>extensive violent criminal history,</v>

2594
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:05.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or I mean it could be levels of</v>

2595
01:47:05.101 --> 01:47:07.800
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of vacation,</v>

2596
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:10.200
<v Speaker 1>of education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather someone who wants to come to this</v>

2597
01:47:10.201 --> 01:47:12.630
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a country of immigrants.</v>

2598
01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:14.700
<v Speaker 1>This is a country where people try to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

2599
01:47:14.850 --> 01:47:16.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're coming here from somewhere</v>

2600
01:47:16.801 --> 01:47:19.760
<v Speaker 1>else and you want to come to America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you would,</v>

2601
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:22.770
<v Speaker 1>you would be coming here because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do better.</v>

2602
01:47:22.771 --> 01:47:26.340
<v Speaker 1>You want to elevate yourself or elevate</v>
<v Speaker 1>your family or give your children the</v>

2603
01:47:26.341 --> 01:47:29.460
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to be educated in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you weren't sure.</v>

2604
01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:32.310
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of what this is founded on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That way it was founded on it,</v>

2605
01:47:32.311 --> 01:47:33.960
<v Speaker 1>so it's become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly wasn't founded on the</v>

2606
01:47:33.961 --> 01:47:36.480
<v Speaker 1>idea for a country of immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The founding fathers weren't like,</v>

2607
01:47:36.481 --> 01:47:37.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2608
01:47:37.110 --> 01:47:37.620
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>

2609
01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:39.360
<v Speaker 1>My hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant.</v>

2610
01:47:39.361 --> 01:47:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm an immigrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly.</v>

2611
01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's plenty of reasons to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>criteria for why people are let it just</v>

2612
01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:47.840
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how do you define immigrants?</v>

2613
01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Just because like if I'm in a war torn</v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

2614
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:53.100
<v Speaker 1>hell yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to America because it's</v>

2615
01:47:53.101 --> 01:47:54.840
<v Speaker 1>going to be better for me and my family</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred percent.</v>

2616
01:47:54.841 --> 01:47:57.060
<v Speaker 1>That's understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that I'm bringing</v>

2617
01:47:57.061 --> 01:47:59.820
<v Speaker 1>something to the table to America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not always.</v>

2618
01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2619
01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can't say that even about</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who comes from a thriving.</v>

2620
01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Correct me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come over from England,</v>

2621
01:48:07.021 --> 01:48:09.840
<v Speaker 1>as I said earlier and they're ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly,</v>

2622
01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:14.250
<v Speaker 1>looser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe we should have a contest of six</v>

2623
01:48:14.251 --> 01:48:16.030
<v Speaker 1>or above us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel?</v>

2624
01:48:16.050 --> 01:48:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel you're a six?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2625
01:48:17.290 --> 01:48:20.310
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm above a sex the way you are,</v>

2626
01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:23.100
<v Speaker 1>but if you were in Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the men are all giant,</v>

2627
01:48:23.130 --> 01:48:23.730
<v Speaker 1>handsome.</v>

2628
01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:25.920
<v Speaker 1>I think he might not be as sick as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good thing I'm not in Holland.</v>

2629
01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Don't let any of those people over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2630
01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:31.590
<v Speaker 1>we got to Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr. President,</v>

2631
01:48:31.591 --> 01:48:34.860
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New comment if I would make them bigger</v>

2632
01:48:34.861 --> 01:48:36.990
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not going to be 20 feet tall,</v>

2633
01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:37.711
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2634
01:48:37.711 --> 01:48:40.110
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll grow Godzilla lions.</v>

2635
01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:42.540
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Under pressure.</v>

2636
01:48:42.541 --> 01:48:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

2637
01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:45.580
<v Speaker 1>but going back to the immigrant thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2638
01:48:45.810 --> 01:48:49.590
<v Speaker 1>this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially everyone who is here who's</v>

2639
01:48:49.610 --> 01:48:52.890
<v Speaker 1>not native American at one point in time</v>
<v Speaker 1>was an immigrant.</v>

2640
01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean there's different types of</v>

2641
01:48:54.961 --> 01:48:57.020
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The immigrants who try to assimilate and</v>

2642
01:48:57.021 --> 01:48:59.220
<v Speaker 1>there's the immigrants who don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>assimilate and just because we've done</v>

2643
01:48:59.221 --> 01:49:01.020
<v Speaker 1>some assimilate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see anybody walking around with</v>

2644
01:49:01.021 --> 01:49:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Buckskin on wearing feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no one assimilate it from</v>

2645
01:49:04.381 --> 01:49:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean I've assimilated?</v>

2646
01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:06.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

2647
01:49:06.901 --> 01:49:08.790
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the original people that came</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

2648
01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:10.110
<v Speaker 1>people that came here.</v>

2649
01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:12.180
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to assimilate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to assimilate with the</v>

2650
01:49:12.181 --> 01:49:14.250
<v Speaker 1>native Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one did that.</v>

2651
01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They conquered them.</v>

2652
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:17.760
<v Speaker 1>He can say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2653
01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was more like genocide than</v>
<v Speaker 1>conquering,</v>

2654
01:49:19.711 --> 01:49:22.170
<v Speaker 1>but Jenna isn't genocide just when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>conquer really well?</v>

2655
01:49:22.230 --> 01:49:23.063
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2656
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:25.380
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of it is unfortunately because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of disease.</v>

2657
01:49:25.410 --> 01:49:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the fact.</v>

2658
01:49:26.281 --> 01:49:30.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea that it genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these native Americans were tough</v>

2659
01:49:30.210 --> 01:49:32.970
<v Speaker 1>cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These were not these like nature hippies</v>

2660
01:49:32.971 --> 01:49:34.950
<v Speaker 1>that they're made out to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's the reason that baseball</v>

2661
01:49:34.951 --> 01:49:37.640
<v Speaker 1>teams are native to native Americans</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were mean.</v>

2662
01:49:37.650 --> 01:49:38.740
<v Speaker 1>They chopped up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2663
01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:40.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's her name?</v>

2664
01:49:40.291 --> 01:49:41.700
<v Speaker 1>The one who founded Rhode Island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2665
01:49:41.701 --> 01:49:43.440
<v Speaker 1>we know the rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was hiding behind which before,</v>

2666
01:49:43.441 --> 01:49:47.530
<v Speaker 1>and she got Scout Scout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they were tough warlike populations,</v>

2667
01:49:47.531 --> 01:49:48.580
<v Speaker 1>many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2668
01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:53.260
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that just because we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>this many immigrant populations means we</v>

2669
01:49:53.261 --> 01:49:54.520
<v Speaker 1>have to continue being that way.</v>

2670
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:56.530
<v Speaker 1>That's not a really a good argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2671
01:49:56.531 --> 01:49:58.750
<v Speaker 1>it's not really an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that we're essentially</v>

2672
01:49:58.751 --> 01:50:02.180
<v Speaker 1>founded by immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Saying we have to keep doing this is</v>

2673
01:50:02.190 --> 01:50:05.170
<v Speaker 1>what what we became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we were counted here from somewhere</v>

2674
01:50:05.171 --> 01:50:06.520
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone came here from somewhere else,</v>

2675
01:50:06.730 --> 01:50:09.490
<v Speaker 1>but we were founded by immigrants from</v>
<v Speaker 1>very specific places.</v>

2676
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Now whether that's good or bad is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate issue,</v>

2677
01:50:12.221 --> 01:50:13.320
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2678
01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:15.850
<v Speaker 1>the founding fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them were from Syria and some of</v>

2679
01:50:15.851 --> 01:50:18.610
<v Speaker 1>them were from then as well as not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2680
01:50:18.630 --> 01:50:21.070
<v Speaker 1>They're mostly from Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly specifically from British</v>

2681
01:50:21.071 --> 01:50:23.260
<v Speaker 1>speaking Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2682
01:50:23.410 --> 01:50:24.340
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2683
01:50:24.341 --> 01:50:26.470
<v Speaker 1>but there were still plenty of</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants from Germany,</v>

2684
01:50:26.471 --> 01:50:29.170
<v Speaker 1>plenty of immigrants from Czechoslovakia</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Poland.</v>

2685
01:50:29.230 --> 01:50:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Poland was a huge immigrant population</v>
<v Speaker 1>early in the birth of the United States.</v>

2686
01:50:34.130 --> 01:50:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were thinking of making German</v>

2687
01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.820
<v Speaker 1>the official language because they hated</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British so much at one point.</v>

2688
01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:41.940
<v Speaker 1>And there's still a huge German speaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>populations,</v>

2689
01:50:41.941 --> 01:50:45.670
<v Speaker 1>but I think this argument is much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated than people make it out to</v>

2690
01:50:45.671 --> 01:50:47.620
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that like,</v>

2691
01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:49.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have complete open</v>

2692
01:50:49.061 --> 01:50:52.030
<v Speaker 1>borders without consequences is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And listen to my.</v>

2693
01:50:52.090 --> 01:50:56.380
<v Speaker 1>My mom still lives in a Russian</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood in Brooklyn and it's a very</v>

2694
01:50:56.381 --> 01:50:59.080
<v Speaker 1>different place from the rest of New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York and I think that's a good thing,</v>

2695
01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:01.150
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that it's not a thing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

2696
01:51:01.151 --> 01:51:02.020
<v Speaker 1>It's false.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're.</v>

2697
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you can't say it's not a thing at</v>

2698
01:51:03.361 --> 01:51:05.860
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is the question whether or not the</v>

2699
01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:09.100
<v Speaker 1>consequences of open borders or worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

2700
01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:14.120
<v Speaker 1>The eventual gain some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian society where everyone has</v>

2701
01:51:15.101 --> 01:51:16.420
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to advance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2702
01:51:16.421 --> 01:51:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of times when people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the left,</v>

2703
01:51:18.970 --> 01:51:22.060
<v Speaker 1>they don't think of costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think if this is a good thing,</v>

2704
01:51:22.061 --> 01:51:24.550
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to worry about the cost</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the right thing to do.</v>

2705
01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:26.410
<v Speaker 1>And then when you bring up the cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're,</v>

2706
01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:27.850
<v Speaker 1>they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're a terrible person.</v>

2707
01:51:27.851 --> 01:51:30.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like sometimes the cost is worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2708
01:51:30.071 --> 01:51:31.900
<v Speaker 1>but you have to acknowledge that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a cost.</v>

2709
01:51:31.901 --> 01:51:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Like we're seeing this right now with</v>
<v Speaker 1>transgender athletes when people are</v>

2710
01:51:34.861 --> 01:51:36.130
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what happens when someone who's</v>

2711
01:51:36.131 --> 01:51:38.890
<v Speaker 1>grown up mail is fighting someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a female?</v>

2712
01:51:38.891 --> 01:51:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Like this is something we have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>grapple with.</v>

2713
01:51:40.181 --> 01:51:40.751
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2714
01:51:40.751 --> 01:51:43.150
<v Speaker 1>you're making up imaginary scenarios</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is happening now,</v>

2715
01:51:43.151 --> 01:51:45.100
<v Speaker 1>like let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's the right thing to do,</v>

2716
01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:49.150
<v Speaker 1>but you still have to consider what are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the costs and radical inclusive</v>

2717
01:51:49.151 --> 01:51:50.830
<v Speaker 1>progressivism is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

2718
01:51:51.090 --> 01:51:53.890
<v Speaker 1>there are no differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference between gender.</v>

2719
01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:56.740
<v Speaker 1>There's no biological difference in</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender.</v>

2720
01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:00.760
<v Speaker 1>So there are so fundamentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in creationism that God created</v>

2721
01:52:01.150 --> 01:52:03.970
<v Speaker 1>the world in seven days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have their own creation is in which</v>

2722
01:52:03.971 --> 01:52:05.600
<v Speaker 1>is that everyone was created equal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>remain.</v>

2723
01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:07.150
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2724
01:52:07.151 --> 01:52:09.730
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work when it comes to combat</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports for sure.</v>

2725
01:52:09.790 --> 01:52:11.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the,</v>

2726
01:52:11.410 --> 01:52:13.000
<v Speaker 1>that's where the rubber meets the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2727
01:52:13.330 --> 01:52:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Heel doesn't work in any aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2728
01:52:15.341 --> 01:52:16.250
<v Speaker 1>if I grew up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2729
01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:17.093
<v Speaker 1>in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

2730
01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:18.880
<v Speaker 1>my dad's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents are lawyers,</v>

2731
01:52:18.881 --> 01:52:21.520
<v Speaker 1>not that they are in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to certainly have that</v>

2732
01:52:21.521 --> 01:52:23.350
<v Speaker 1>background and that advantage that other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't have.</v>

2733
01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Now that might be a good thing or it</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a bad thing,</v>

2734
01:52:25.481 --> 01:52:26.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2735
01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:28.540
<v Speaker 1>it is a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you want to continue in</v>

2736
01:52:28.541 --> 01:52:29.374
<v Speaker 1>that business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2737
01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:30.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While there's.</v>

2738
01:52:30.401 --> 01:52:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea that we're all,</v>

2739
01:52:32.110 --> 01:52:35.170
<v Speaker 1>that we come from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an even position that we're all the</v>

2740
01:52:35.171 --> 01:52:37.090
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starting Line is pretty preposterous.</v>

2741
01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2742
01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:39.730
<v Speaker 1>The idea is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2743
01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:40.780
<v Speaker 1>if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2744
01:52:40.781 --> 01:52:42.400
<v Speaker 1>you can't fix that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't change that.</v>

2745
01:52:42.401 --> 01:52:44.110
<v Speaker 1>That is what it is and you shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to change it.</v>

2746
01:52:44.410 --> 01:52:46.130
<v Speaker 1>We should try to do is make the best</v>

2747
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:48.050
<v Speaker 2>out of whatever hand you've been given.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2748
01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

2749
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:53.090
<v Speaker 2>I think if you want to look at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>country and the real issues that we face</v>

2750
01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:54.440
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2751
01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:59.120
<v Speaker 2>they're multifaceted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the biggest ones is that</v>

2752
01:52:59.270 --> 01:53:03.080
<v Speaker 2>there are some areas of our country that</v>
<v Speaker 2>continue to,</v>

2753
01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:06.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have people that are impoverished and in</v>

2754
01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:08.840
<v Speaker 2>crime ridden areas and these areas don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever change.</v>

2755
01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:10.670
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of our biggest problems.</v>

2756
01:53:10.671 --> 01:53:12.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're so concerned with all these</v>

2757
01:53:12.591 --> 01:53:17.300
<v Speaker 2>different issues and all sorts of valid</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues that are happening all over the</v>

2758
01:53:17.301 --> 01:53:20.510
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the issues of our own impoverished</v>

2759
01:53:20.511 --> 01:53:23.390
<v Speaker 2>communities that continue to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>impoverished south side of Chicago,</v>

2760
01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:25.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible areas of Texas are.</v>

2761
01:53:25.751 --> 01:53:29.360
<v Speaker 2>So there's some areas that just don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>get any better and they stay that way</v>

2762
01:53:29.361 --> 01:53:32.450
<v Speaker 2>generation after generation after</v>
<v Speaker 2>generation and they don't.</v>

2763
01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:38.020
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough interest in them in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of like broad mainstream focus</v>

2764
01:53:38.690 --> 01:53:39.400
<v Speaker 2>where they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2765
01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:43.430
<v Speaker 2>well we have to dedicate and allocate a</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive amount of resources to fixing</v>

2766
01:53:43.431 --> 01:53:44.210
<v Speaker 2>these inner cities.</v>

2767
01:53:44.210 --> 01:53:46.760
<v Speaker 2>And maybe just one project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one flint,</v>

2768
01:53:46.761 --> 01:53:49.460
<v Speaker 2>Michigan style project where they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2769
01:53:49.461 --> 01:53:52.700
<v Speaker 2>let's just dump and an x amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>

2770
01:53:52.701 --> 01:53:56.870
<v Speaker 2>money and engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out some way to fix these areas,</v>

2771
01:53:56.871 --> 01:53:59.630
<v Speaker 2>provide jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make things more safe,</v>

2772
01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:01.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>established community centers.</v>

2773
01:54:01.881 --> 01:54:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Do something and let's see if we can do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and have it one case study one</v>

2774
01:54:06.351 --> 01:54:08.030
<v Speaker 2>impoverished city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if he could bring it up.</v>

2775
01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:10.850
<v Speaker 2>And then once you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move forward and try this in other</v>

2776
01:54:10.851 --> 01:54:14.870
<v Speaker 2>places I've always had like the best way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make America stronger is to have less</v>

2777
01:54:14.871 --> 01:54:17.150
<v Speaker 2>losers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the best way to have less</v>

2778
01:54:17.151 --> 01:54:17.751
<v Speaker 2>losers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2779
01:54:17.751 --> 01:54:20.150
<v Speaker 2>one one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one way is to give people more of a</v>

2780
01:54:20.151 --> 01:54:21.380
<v Speaker 2>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give people.</v>

2781
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Like if you grew up in suburban Los</v>
<v Speaker 2>Angeles and you live in some nice</v>

2782
01:54:25.011 --> 01:54:27.860
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>studio city or something like that,</v>

2783
01:54:27.861 --> 01:54:31.880
<v Speaker 2>it's fairly safe and you have a much</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher likelihood of success than</v>

2784
01:54:31.881 --> 01:54:36.800
<v Speaker 2>someone who grows up in a crime ridden</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug filled environment where people are</v>

2785
01:54:36.801 --> 01:54:41.270
<v Speaker 2>constantly going to jail and those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those sort of recurring cycles of</v>

2786
01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:44.240
<v Speaker 2>poverty and crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they happened generation after</v>

2787
01:54:44.241 --> 01:54:47.480
<v Speaker 2>generation after generation and some in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some cases,</v>

2788
01:54:47.481 --> 01:54:50.540
<v Speaker 2>like in Baltimore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's clear evidence of systematic</v>

2789
01:54:50.541 --> 01:54:51.650
<v Speaker 2>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2790
01:54:51.651 --> 01:54:55.130
<v Speaker 2>that literally people were stopped from</v>
<v Speaker 2>buying houses in certain areas.</v>

2791
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:58.370
<v Speaker 2>Stop from moving into areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in other areas it's like,</v>

2792
01:54:58.550 --> 01:55:01.940
<v Speaker 2>it's just almost like it does it itself</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's right,</v>

2793
01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:03.311
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2794
01:55:03.311 --> 01:55:04.071
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2795
01:55:04.071 --> 01:55:06.770
<v Speaker 1>I always have this litmus test for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to find out if they're left wing</v>

2796
01:55:06.771 --> 01:55:09.080
<v Speaker 1>or right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people like to pretend I'm neither,</v>

2797
01:55:09.081 --> 01:55:11.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ask them are some people better than</v>

2798
01:55:11.871 --> 01:55:13.370
<v Speaker 1>others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're right wing you're going to</v>

2799
01:55:13.371 --> 01:55:15.140
<v Speaker 1>say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're left wing,</v>

2800
01:55:15.141 --> 01:55:17.870
<v Speaker 1>you're going to start babbling a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech better in like,</v>

2801
01:55:17.871 --> 01:55:19.850
<v Speaker 1>what does better mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you think.</v>

2802
01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:23.430
<v Speaker 1>In any sense of the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's sucking dicks as some people</v>

2803
01:55:23.590 --> 01:55:25.370
<v Speaker 1>who are better and some people are clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right here,</v>

2804
01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:27.890
<v Speaker 1>but what causes that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are like,</v>

2805
01:55:27.891 --> 01:55:29.120
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just need to learn how to suck</v>

2806
01:55:29.121 --> 01:55:29.954
<v Speaker 1>dicks better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2807
01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not everyone that I get,</v>

2808
01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a road on,</v>

2809
01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I know enough about to go down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but dare you.</v>

2810
01:55:36.590 --> 01:55:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say play the flute,</v>

2811
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2812
01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:41.510
<v Speaker 1>So the skin flute or regular flu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are better at it,</v>

2813
01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:43.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are better at math,</v>

2814
01:55:43.710 --> 01:55:45.930
<v Speaker 1>some people and that's going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>function of the mind,</v>

2815
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:47.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that not everyone's</v>

2816
01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:51.000
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to equally good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to start with that point</v>

2817
01:55:51.001 --> 01:55:53.700
<v Speaker 1>that we are born with different gifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2818
01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:56.850
<v Speaker 1>or we have different interests and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue those specialty focus and</v>

2819
01:55:56.851 --> 01:55:58.410
<v Speaker 1>determination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2820
01:55:58.411 --> 01:56:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's certain things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>guitarists,</v>

2821
01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:02.040
<v Speaker 1>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt about it.</v>

2822
01:56:02.041 --> 01:56:04.230
<v Speaker 1>This isn't like Stevie Ray Vaughan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimi Hendrix,</v>

2823
01:56:04.231 --> 01:56:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Gary Clark Jr is people that have like</v>
<v Speaker 1>an exceptional ability to play</v>

2824
01:56:07.951 --> 01:56:10.540
<v Speaker 1>incredible music out of a guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that,</v>

2825
01:56:10.590 --> 01:56:11.790
<v Speaker 1>what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that mean?</v>

2826
01:56:11.850 --> 01:56:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Where's that coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2827
01:56:12.811 --> 01:56:14.370
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I are both self taught.</v>

2828
01:56:14.371 --> 01:56:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you never get a major in</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasting.</v>

2829
01:56:16.231 --> 01:56:17.730
<v Speaker 1>I never took an English course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2830
01:56:17.731 --> 01:56:19.500
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've had many different careers</v>

2831
01:56:19.501 --> 01:56:20.040
<v Speaker 1>over your life.</v>

2832
01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:22.590
<v Speaker 1>So vi and that's just a function of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>

2833
01:56:22.591 --> 01:56:23.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not a function of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

2834
01:56:23.970 --> 01:56:25.030
<v Speaker 1>the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2835
01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:26.610
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also luck.</v>

2836
01:56:26.670 --> 01:56:28.800
<v Speaker 1>It's also being in the right place at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right time.</v>

2837
01:56:28.801 --> 01:56:33.801
<v Speaker 1>It's also finding a job that exists that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fills my very unique personality and</v>

2838
01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:36.960
<v Speaker 1>making that job exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>

2839
01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:38.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one made me write this book.</v>

2840
01:56:38.641 --> 01:56:41.760
<v Speaker 1>I did a kickstarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I raised the 30 grand and I'm like,</v>

2841
01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:44.430
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to do it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the publishing industry didn't know</v>

2842
01:56:44.431 --> 01:56:46.320
<v Speaker 1>what to make of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how's it been?</v>

2843
01:56:46.350 --> 01:56:47.520
<v Speaker 1>How's it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2844
01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2845
01:56:48.420 --> 01:56:50.140
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the first one to have a,</v>

2846
01:56:50.141 --> 01:56:53.220
<v Speaker 1>a cspan book TV for a kickstarter book a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole hour.</v>

2847
01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on all these different shows talking</v>

2848
01:56:55.051 --> 01:56:58.480
<v Speaker 1>about it because they didn't know it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a great success with as that</v>

2849
01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:01.410
<v Speaker 1>in that way it's got parallels I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>to podcasting.</v>

2850
01:57:01.410 --> 01:57:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that once you find something that</v>

2851
01:57:04.441 --> 01:57:07.740
<v Speaker 1>you're really passionate about this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people realize that you're really</v>

2852
01:57:07.741 --> 01:57:10.170
<v Speaker 1>passionate about and you put so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort and focus into it,</v>

2853
01:57:10.171 --> 01:57:11.790
<v Speaker 1>they can see that in your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2854
01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:14.430
<v Speaker 1>and they appreciate that and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are very much,</v>

2855
01:57:14.431 --> 01:57:16.770
<v Speaker 1>and this is another reason I load</v>
<v Speaker 1>cynicism.</v>

2856
01:57:17.070 --> 01:57:20.460
<v Speaker 1>People are drawn to earnestness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are drawn into passion and they are</v>

2857
01:57:20.461 --> 01:57:22.720
<v Speaker 1>drawn to sincerity and honesty and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>La,</v>

2858
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:26.190
<v Speaker 1>La and we're hungry for it and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperate for it and especially I think</v>

2859
01:57:26.191 --> 01:57:29.580
<v Speaker 1>increasingly young males because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much eye rolling and there's so much</v>

2860
01:57:29.581 --> 01:57:31.500
<v Speaker 1>snark and all this other stuff which I</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2861
01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:33.600
<v Speaker 1>but they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a better guy.</v>

2862
01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a smarter person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the big lies I was told growing</v>

2863
01:57:37.591 --> 01:57:40.230
<v Speaker 1>up is that the jocks and the nerds hate</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

2864
01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:43.050
<v Speaker 1>and when that was working with Matt</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hughes on his book and hanging out with</v>

2865
01:57:43.051 --> 01:57:45.780
<v Speaker 1>his fighter buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a total mutual admiration</v>

2866
01:57:45.781 --> 01:57:46.500
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

2867
01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:50.010
<v Speaker 1>There was no eyebrow raised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no shit talking.</v>

2868
01:57:50.011 --> 01:57:50.910
<v Speaker 1>It was complete like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2869
01:57:50.911 --> 01:57:52.360
<v Speaker 1>you're a smart dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2870
01:57:52.410 --> 01:57:53.490
<v Speaker 1>let me learn from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2871
01:57:53.491 --> 01:57:54.570
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are athletes.</v>

2872
01:57:54.571 --> 01:57:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Let me learn from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's totally mutual respect.</v>

2873
01:57:56.671 --> 01:57:58.020
<v Speaker 1>It totally blew my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2874
01:57:58.021 --> 01:58:02.130
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about martial artists</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's everybody kind of.</v>

2875
01:58:02.190 --> 01:58:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people start off with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain physical talents and physical</v>

2876
01:58:05.311 --> 01:58:08.280
<v Speaker 1>gifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to like technique and</v>

2877
01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:10.390
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn this,</v>

2878
01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:12.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's something that's very humbling</v>

2879
01:58:12.661 --> 01:58:15.120
<v Speaker 1>along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they have this understanding that</v>

2880
01:58:15.121 --> 01:58:19.470
<v Speaker 1>hard work and focus and technique and</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

2881
01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All applied together equals results.</v>

2882
01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're awesome people and obviously</v>

2883
01:58:24.301 --> 01:58:25.890
<v Speaker 1>this is your world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I've been.</v>

2884
01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:29.310
<v Speaker 1>I was blown away by these guys and had</v>
<v Speaker 1>such respect for them and I didn't think</v>

2885
01:58:29.311 --> 01:58:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's changing.</v>

2886
01:58:30.691 --> 01:58:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I think perception of who fighters are</v>
<v Speaker 1>is changing and I think that's one of</v>

2887
01:58:33.361 --> 01:58:38.361
<v Speaker 1>the reasons why there's such a big blow</v>
<v Speaker 1>back when someone is like a thuggish</v>

2888
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 1>bully asshole ish sort of and that</v>

2889
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:46.360
<v Speaker 2>these people aren't respected nearly as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much as someone like a George St Pierre</v>

2890
01:58:46.361 --> 01:58:47.440
<v Speaker 2>who is a gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2891
01:58:47.650 --> 01:58:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Conor mcgregor who was just this wild,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant trash talker.</v>

2892
01:58:51.070 --> 01:58:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these people like you,</v>

2893
01:58:52.751 --> 01:58:53.180
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2894
01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:57.670
<v Speaker 2>you could recognize that there some</v>
<v Speaker 2>significant mind games going on.</v>

2895
01:58:57.950 --> 01:59:01.900
<v Speaker 2>There's some real thinking and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not macho in the sense of they're not</v>

2896
01:59:01.901 --> 01:59:04.060
<v Speaker 2>posturing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't need to stand up and be</v>

2897
01:59:04.061 --> 01:59:05.260
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can kick your ass like all the</v>

2898
01:59:05.261 --> 01:59:07.210
<v Speaker 2>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew if people go up to the bar and be</v>

2899
01:59:07.211 --> 01:59:07.601
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2900
01:59:07.601 --> 01:59:08.860
<v Speaker 2>I bet you I could kick your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>

2901
01:59:08.861 --> 01:59:10.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2902
01:59:10.130 --> 01:59:13.300
<v Speaker 2>It still happens to these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to walk away from fights all</v>

2903
01:59:13.301 --> 01:59:15.190
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they do it gladly because they don't</v>

2904
01:59:15.191 --> 01:59:16.100
<v Speaker 2>have a chip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them do.</v>

2905
01:59:16.101 --> 01:59:17.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you have a chip on the shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 2>of most of the ones I met.</v>

2906
01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:19.480
<v Speaker 2>None of them did and they would just be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2907
01:59:19.481 --> 01:59:20.314
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

2908
01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:23.980
<v Speaker 2>I saw it in person one night at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nightclub in Vegas with some guy was</v>

2909
01:59:23.981 --> 01:59:27.070
<v Speaker 2>talking shit to chocolate Dell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so ridiculous.</v>

2910
01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:29.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this guy doing?</v>

2911
01:59:29.590 --> 01:59:32.650
<v Speaker 2>And then chocolate Dell just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at him dead eyed and you know,</v>

2912
01:59:32.651 --> 01:59:35.680
<v Speaker 2>it said something to them and you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy like saw his life passed before</v>

2913
01:59:35.681 --> 01:59:39.100
<v Speaker 2>his eyes and eventually realized came to</v>
<v Speaker 2>his senses and people pulled them away.</v>

2914
01:59:39.101 --> 01:59:41.140
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this fucking guy doing?</v>

2915
01:59:41.230 --> 01:59:44.320
<v Speaker 2>And it's so funny that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>scariest moments of my life when I was</v>

2916
01:59:44.321 --> 01:59:47.770
<v Speaker 2>working with he was on his book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's such a happy go lucky guy.</v>

2917
01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:50.380
<v Speaker 2>And then once I got an argument his face</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed and I'm like,</v>

2918
01:59:50.381 --> 01:59:52.540
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's who you are.</v>

2919
01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:55.930
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I completely forgot that he killed her.</v>

2920
01:59:56.980 --> 01:59:58.990
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the greatest welterweight</v>
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>

2921
01:59:59.810 --> 02:00:01.120
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2922
02:00:01.121 --> 02:00:02.560
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I felt stupid to.</v>

2923
02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Well Matt was with first guy that</v>
<v Speaker 2>incorporated great wrestling with real</v>

2924
02:00:08.141 --> 02:00:11.950
<v Speaker 2>high level submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see submitted Matt Frank Trigg,</v>

2925
02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:14.980
<v Speaker 2>when he submitted George St Pierre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he submitted George Saint Pierre</v>

2926
02:00:14.981 --> 02:00:18.160
<v Speaker 2>with very advanced move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hit him with a farsighted armbar.</v>

2927
02:00:18.190 --> 02:00:21.490
<v Speaker 2>George committed to a memorial but</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have control of Matt's body and</v>

2928
02:00:21.491 --> 02:00:23.880
<v Speaker 2>Matt hit the far side arm bar and spun</v>
<v Speaker 2>around on him.</v>

2929
02:00:23.881 --> 02:00:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I remember watching that was for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was at 4:59 of the first round.</v>

2930
02:00:27.011 --> 02:00:29.350
<v Speaker 2>I believe he had one second to go and</v>
<v Speaker 2>George tapping really quick.</v>

2931
02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:33.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what time it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember that just a brilliant</v>

2932
02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:34.440
<v Speaker 2>move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he,</v>

2933
02:00:34.450 --> 02:00:36.580
<v Speaker 2>when he was starting out was he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2934
02:00:36.581 --> 02:00:38.260
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm strong and I'm a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestler.</v>

2935
02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:40.540
<v Speaker 2>I got to learn technique or else it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be used against me.</v>

2936
02:00:40.541 --> 02:00:42.640
<v Speaker 2>So it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strategic with his approach.</v>

2937
02:00:42.730 --> 02:00:45.430
<v Speaker 2>He really wasn't a big factor in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole camp.</v>

2938
02:00:45.431 --> 02:00:50.320
<v Speaker 2>That miletich fighting system camp was</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Horn who was like really like</v>

2939
02:00:50.321 --> 02:00:53.860
<v Speaker 2>kind of a nerdy guy and a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not a bully type guy at all,</v>

2940
02:00:54.070 --> 02:00:56.800
<v Speaker 2>not a very strong guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a freak athlete,</v>

2941
02:00:56.801 --> 02:01:01.801
<v Speaker 2>but had more than a hundred and 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>professional fights and one a shit ton</v>

2942
02:01:01.961 --> 02:01:04.340
<v Speaker 2>of them and was really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the first guy to beat chocolate.</v>

2943
02:01:04.341 --> 02:01:07.510
<v Speaker 2>They'll put them to sleep from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom with an arm triangle from the</v>

2944
02:01:07.511 --> 02:01:12.160
<v Speaker 2>bottom because he was just a brilliant</v>
<v Speaker 2>tactician and just very good at staying</v>

2945
02:01:12.161 --> 02:01:15.370
<v Speaker 2>calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very good at figuring out like it was</v>

2946
02:01:15.371 --> 02:01:18.310
<v Speaker 2>all technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy was all technique and still is.</v>

2947
02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never met you.</v>

2948
02:01:19.210 --> 02:01:21.590
<v Speaker 2>I met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always spoke extremely highly of.</v>

2949
02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:24.400
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy and all those people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's a super polite,</v>

2950
02:01:24.430 --> 02:01:27.670
<v Speaker 2>really kindhearted guy who just happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a trained killer.</v>

2951
02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these guys that's not super</v>

2952
02:01:29.681 --> 02:01:30.700
<v Speaker 2>polite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he is.</v>

2953
02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:32.390
<v Speaker 2>He's very polite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think he's super blessed.</v>

2954
02:01:32.391 --> 02:01:34.930
<v Speaker 2>So the thing with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I can't say enough good things</v>

2955
02:01:34.931 --> 02:01:36.700
<v Speaker 2>about him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like having been friends with him and</v>

2956
02:01:36.701 --> 02:01:38.800
<v Speaker 2>his family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To this day I still go out to</v>

2957
02:01:38.801 --> 02:01:41.630
<v Speaker 2>hillsborough to visit them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has changed my life so profoundly,</v>

2958
02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:44.240
<v Speaker 2>but he would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt Hughes meets you.</v>

2959
02:01:44.241 --> 02:01:47.410
<v Speaker 2>He'll be making fun of you and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have them on a pedestal so they won't</v>

2960
02:01:47.411 --> 02:01:49.250
<v Speaker 2>respond back and he looks like an</v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>

2961
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:51.620
<v Speaker 2>So when I first got the project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a great story.</v>

2962
02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I was on the phone with his manager and</v>
<v Speaker 2>his manager goes,</v>

2963
02:01:53.961 --> 02:01:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Matt's got a twin brother and when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>start messing with you,</v>

2964
02:01:57.200 --> 02:01:59.120
<v Speaker 2>you just got to stand there and take it</v>
<v Speaker 2>until they're tired.</v>

2965
02:01:59.121 --> 02:02:00.140
<v Speaker 2>And I thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nigga,</v>

2966
02:02:00.141 --> 02:02:01.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm from Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't play that shit.</v>

2967
02:02:01.281 --> 02:02:03.830
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God as much as I thought it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it.</v>

2968
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:06.850
<v Speaker 2>And then I think racist words to</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself during.</v>

2969
02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:07.873
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking one now.</v>

2970
02:02:10.730 --> 02:02:15.730
<v Speaker 2>So I meet Matt and he starts with me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit him back hard and he loved it.</v>

2971
02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:20.750
<v Speaker 2>He loves being the butt of a joke</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he wants to be a regular guy.</v>

2972
02:02:20.751 --> 02:02:23.090
<v Speaker 2>He hates being on a pedestal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hates being.</v>

2973
02:02:23.091 --> 02:02:27.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm the world champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's those normal dude and I think it</v>

2974
02:02:27.111 --> 02:02:29.480
<v Speaker 2>kind of bothers him that people won't</v>
<v Speaker 2>make fun of him back.</v>

2975
02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:31.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of fight gym culture though.</v>

2976
02:02:31.491 --> 02:02:32.880
<v Speaker 2>Everybody makes fun of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the.</v>

2977
02:02:33.130 --> 02:02:35.930
<v Speaker 2>But they're scared to make fun of him</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's all my God Matt Hughes and</v>

2978
02:02:35.931 --> 02:02:36.380
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2998
02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:24.150

<v Speaker 2>Left.</v>

2999
02:03:24.660 --> 02:03:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these guys,</v>

3000
02:03:26.210 --> 02:03:28.820
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of gallows humor and a lot</v>

3001
02:03:28.821 --> 02:03:33.500
<v Speaker 2>of like really funny guys that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in like these fight gems.</v>

3002
02:03:33.620 --> 02:03:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because they're dealing with such</v>

3003
02:03:35.481 --> 02:03:38.510
<v Speaker 2>incredible stress levels that they need</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a blow off valve.</v>

3004
02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3005
02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:43.700
<v Speaker 2>Derrick Lewis is one of the top</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight cage fighting fighters on</v>

3006
02:03:43.701 --> 02:03:44.720
<v Speaker 2>the planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3007
02:03:44.721 --> 02:03:47.120
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the best in the UFC right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

3008
02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:48.950
<v Speaker 2>He's just knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Travis Browne,</v>

3009
02:03:48.951 --> 02:03:52.340
<v Speaker 2>knocked him out cold and recovered from</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rough first round,</v>

3010
02:03:52.341 --> 02:03:54.170
<v Speaker 2>got hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came back and knocked him out.</v>

3011
02:03:54.171 --> 02:03:59.120
<v Speaker 2>So his instagram just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would think that he'd be like this</v>

3012
02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:03.170
<v Speaker 2>crazy psychopaths running hills and</v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming into the night,</v>

3013
02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:04.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I remember when I was a kid,</v>

3014
02:04:05.230 --> 02:04:09.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a video of Mostafa Ham show</v>

3015
02:04:09.290 --> 02:04:12.050
<v Speaker 2>versus Marvin Hagler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will do it showing this promo clip</v>

3016
02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:15.740
<v Speaker 2>and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived in Boston and Hagler was a</v>

3017
02:04:15.741 --> 02:04:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Boston guy was from brockton and he used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to train in the Cape because it was</v>

3018
02:04:19.941 --> 02:04:23.390
<v Speaker 2>freezing cold in the winter and they'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>have him running these sand dudes in the</v>

3019
02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:24.690
<v Speaker 2>renter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And while he's running them,</v>

3020
02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:29.960
<v Speaker 2>he was screaming war and Hagler was</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying because he was just ripped</v>

3021
02:04:29.961 --> 02:04:34.130
<v Speaker 2>and muscular and he had a bald head and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just was a destroyer.</v>

3022
02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:37.740
<v Speaker 2>And so that was my idea of like what a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter is like a daily,</v>

3023
02:04:37.770 --> 02:04:39.120
<v Speaker 2>like this solemn.</v>

3024
02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3025
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:44.370
<v Speaker 2>character clowns in the best possible</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

3026
02:04:44.430 --> 02:04:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are very,</v>

3027
02:04:45.511 --> 02:04:48.290
<v Speaker 2>very funny and it just and appreciate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they're not funded,</v>

3028
02:04:48.291 --> 02:04:52.180
<v Speaker 2>the appreciate a good sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of joking around for breezy over</v>

3029
02:04:52.181 --> 02:04:54.090
<v Speaker 2>doom jokes around a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's pretty funny.</v>

3030
02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of them that are like</v>

3031
02:04:56.071 --> 02:04:57.540
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

3032
02:04:58.110 --> 02:05:01.470
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when people are too serious and</v>

3033
02:05:01.471 --> 02:05:04.530
<v Speaker 2>they lose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when the public goes after them.</v>

3034
02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:06.090
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Ronda Rousey.</v>

3035
02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3036
02:05:07.010 --> 02:05:09.300
<v Speaker 2>Like I can beat anyone on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3037
02:05:09.301 --> 02:05:13.140
<v Speaker 2>When the public one after her boy woo</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark.</v>

3038
02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:15.480
<v Speaker 2>And Matt always said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not losing,</v>

3039
02:05:15.481 --> 02:05:17.550
<v Speaker 2>you're not fighting the right people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3040
02:05:17.730 --> 02:05:18.563
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3041
02:05:18.570 --> 02:05:20.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're some fucking freak of</v>

3042
02:05:20.911 --> 02:05:23.790
<v Speaker 2>athleticism and some top of the food</v>
<v Speaker 2>chain,</v>

3043
02:05:23.791 --> 02:05:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Roy Jones Jr type character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's always gonna be those guys</v>

3044
02:05:27.140 --> 02:05:28.770
<v Speaker 2>just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always outliers,</v>

3045
02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:29.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3046
02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Who essentially their bar movers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they change expectations.</v>

3047
02:05:33.631 --> 02:05:37.110
<v Speaker 2>Like there was expectations for</v>
<v Speaker 2>performances inside the UFC.</v>

3048
02:05:37.111 --> 02:05:40.020
<v Speaker 2>And then there was Anderson Silva and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then Anderson Silva came along and</v>

3049
02:05:40.021 --> 02:05:40.651
<v Speaker 2>everybody went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3050
02:05:40.651 --> 02:05:43.290
<v Speaker 2>well we now we know that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But were you,</v>

3051
02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:46.350
<v Speaker 2>were you calling the fight when he broke</v>
<v Speaker 2>his shin?</v>

3052
02:05:46.860 --> 02:05:49.250
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that like in real life to see?</v>

3053
02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:52.920
<v Speaker 2>So second time I've seen that first time</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it was Corey Hill broke his shin.</v>

3054
02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:54.780
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3055
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:59.220
<v Speaker 2>I had to scream at the referee that time</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the referee didn't realize it</v>

3056
02:05:59.221 --> 02:06:00.870
<v Speaker 2>had happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3057
02:06:00.910 --> 02:06:01.740
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3058
02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:04.920
<v Speaker 2>because he was in a different position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the referee was not in a position to</v>

3059
02:06:04.921 --> 02:06:08.370
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then corey went down and um,</v>

3060
02:06:08.610 --> 02:06:10.500
<v Speaker 2>I forget his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the dude,</v>

3061
02:06:10.501 --> 02:06:13.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when his opponent was attacking him,</v>

3062
02:06:13.771 --> 02:06:15.990
<v Speaker 2>the referee hadn't realized that core</v>
<v Speaker 2>his leg,</v>

3063
02:06:15.991 --> 02:06:17.220
<v Speaker 2>it's snapped in half yet.</v>

3064
02:06:17.550 --> 02:06:21.630
<v Speaker 2>So I'm fucking screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took my headphones off and I stood up</v>

3065
02:06:21.870 --> 02:06:23.430
<v Speaker 2>and I'm screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

3066
02:06:23.431 --> 02:06:26.580
<v Speaker 2>The fight stopped the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

3067
02:06:26.810 --> 02:06:27.631
<v Speaker 2>did they stop it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They heard,</v>

3068
02:06:27.631 --> 02:06:29.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he figured it out.</v>

3069
02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:31.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it helped I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just couldn't help it.</v>

3070
02:06:31.410 --> 02:06:33.120
<v Speaker 2>I just had to jump up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means it was.</v>

3071
02:06:33.570 --> 02:06:37.950
<v Speaker 2>I'd only seen it on film before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anybody's leg snap like</v>

3072
02:06:37.951 --> 02:06:39.090
<v Speaker 2>that in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3073
02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:41.200
<v Speaker 2>And it's seen in a few times and</v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing match.</v>

3074
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had a lot live only on video.</v>

3075
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:46.620
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe the human body can do</v>

3076
02:06:46.621 --> 02:06:47.820
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I could do it.</v>

3077
02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:50.400
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it happen a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happened to one of the best kick</v>

3078
02:06:50.401 --> 02:06:53.730
<v Speaker 2>boxers in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyrone spong just a couple of years ago.</v>

3079
02:06:53.731 --> 02:06:56.200
<v Speaker 2>And it essentially shut his kickboxing</v>
<v Speaker 2>career now.</v>

3080
02:06:56.670 --> 02:06:59.450
<v Speaker 2>He was fighting go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saki was also one of the best kickbox is</v>

3081
02:06:59.451 --> 02:07:01.710
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And go checked one of his kicks and</v>

3082
02:07:01.711 --> 02:07:05.590
<v Speaker 2>tyrone's leg just act like a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3083
02:07:05.790 --> 02:07:08.510
<v Speaker 2>And spong is just elite of the elite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the.</v>

3084
02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:12.270
<v Speaker 2>It was like these two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrone spong and go con sock.</v>

3085
02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:15.510
<v Speaker 2>It was like a world class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing fight where the whole</v>

3086
02:07:15.810 --> 02:07:19.140
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people that are like myself,</v>

3087
02:07:19.141 --> 02:07:20.430
<v Speaker 2>there are big fans were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoo,</v>

3088
02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:22.380
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we go and see it.</v>

3089
02:07:22.381 --> 02:07:25.800
<v Speaker 2>And like that there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you had the Anderson one was very</v>

3090
02:07:25.801 --> 02:07:28.920
<v Speaker 2>unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know that they think he broke</v>

3091
02:07:28.921 --> 02:07:31.980
<v Speaker 2>his leg actually with a kick earlier in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that round.</v>

3092
02:07:32.070 --> 02:07:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hurting him apparently already.</v>

3093
02:07:34.930 --> 02:07:38.260
<v Speaker 2>And then he threw that and it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>snapped in half so it might have been</v>

3094
02:07:38.261 --> 02:07:41.710
<v Speaker 2>already compromised by a similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

3095
02:07:41.710 --> 02:07:44.890
<v Speaker 2>And then that one maybe like a hairline</v>
<v Speaker 2>fracture and that one just snapped it</v>

3096
02:07:44.891 --> 02:07:48.280
<v Speaker 2>all in half that I couldn't handle that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's rough.</v>

3097
02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:50.080
<v Speaker 2>It's a rough game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3098
02:07:50.710 --> 02:07:51.580
<v Speaker 2>Corey Hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy,</v>

3099
02:07:51.670 --> 02:07:53.620
<v Speaker 2>the first guy that had happened to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's dead now.</v>

3100
02:07:53.621 --> 02:07:55.840
<v Speaker 2>He died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what he died of,</v>

3101
02:07:55.860 --> 02:07:57.040
<v Speaker 2>but he died real young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3102
02:07:57.060 --> 02:07:59.740
<v Speaker 2>there's Corey Hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dale Heart.</v>

3103
02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:00.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's who it is.</v>

3104
02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a rough,</v>

3105
02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:07.390
<v Speaker 2>rough fucking fight to watch men seat</v>
<v Speaker 2>snap in half like that.</v>

3106
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:10.600
<v Speaker 2>So it's only happened twice in the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that way.</v>

3107
02:08:10.740 --> 02:08:11.573
<v Speaker 2>But we've had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3108
02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:13.870
<v Speaker 2>we've had a significant number of broken</v>
<v Speaker 2>bones,</v>

3109
02:08:14.590 --> 02:08:18.100
<v Speaker 2>like Frank Mir snapped Tim Silvia's arm</v>
<v Speaker 2>and half.</v>

3110
02:08:18.130 --> 02:08:20.440
<v Speaker 2>That was pretty fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd met Tim.</v>

3111
02:08:20.441 --> 02:08:21.880
<v Speaker 2>He was a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a good guy.</v>

3112
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:23.080
<v Speaker 2>Quiet guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3113
02:08:23.770 --> 02:08:24.990
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3114
02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:30.060
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy that just didn't have like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of athletic talent,</v>

3115
02:08:30.610 --> 02:08:31.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3116
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:33.760
<v Speaker 2>Just hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>determination and a little bit of</v>

3117
02:08:33.761 --> 02:08:36.150
<v Speaker 2>steroids and a great coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3118
02:08:36.250 --> 02:08:37.350
<v Speaker 2>And Pat Miletich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>

3119
02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:39.310
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's work with what I have and I'm</v>

3120
02:08:39.311 --> 02:08:41.650
<v Speaker 2>going to make you a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you did back in the day,</v>

3121
02:08:41.651 --> 02:08:43.600
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he fought Rico Rodriguez.</v>

3122
02:08:43.601 --> 02:08:47.050
<v Speaker 2>And back in the day when Mexicans</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplements were a lot easier to get</v>

3123
02:08:47.051 --> 02:08:49.780
<v Speaker 2>away with Tim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sylvia was a fucking destroyer.</v>

3124
02:08:50.170 --> 02:08:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Tim Silvia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He missed like that era was the era of</v>

3125
02:08:55.211 --> 02:08:58.570
<v Speaker 2>the guys who fought in pride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wild West era where you could just</v>

3126
02:08:58.571 --> 02:09:02.590
<v Speaker 2>kind of do whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If Sylvia existed in that era,</v>

3127
02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:04.090
<v Speaker 2>just Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3128
02:09:04.330 --> 02:09:05.890
<v Speaker 2>he might've been one of the best at</v>
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>

3129
02:09:05.891 --> 02:09:10.891
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go back to like go see if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find Tim Silvia versus Rico</v>

3130
02:09:11.050 --> 02:09:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Rodriguez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when he won the title dude.</v>

3131
02:09:12.491 --> 02:09:16.780
<v Speaker 2>He was a fucking destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had to cut weight to make to 65.</v>

3132
02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:19.600
<v Speaker 2>He was fucking 70 feet tall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jacked.</v>

3133
02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:23.050
<v Speaker 2>And this was an Tim Silvia was people</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of Tim Silvia.</v>

3134
02:09:23.051 --> 02:09:26.200
<v Speaker 2>They think of Tim Silvia being</v>
<v Speaker 2>overweight when he fought rate mercery</v>

3135
02:09:26.230 --> 02:09:29.770
<v Speaker 2>got knocked out with one punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You in the early days of Tim.</v>

3136
02:09:29.771 --> 02:09:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Sylvia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was on top of his game,</v>

3137
02:09:31.121 --> 02:09:33.590
<v Speaker 2>he was fucking terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

3138
02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:36.670
<v Speaker 2>See if you can find like a better photo</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it though.</v>

3139
02:09:36.671 --> 02:09:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Like you could see like how fucking huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

3140
02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there he is right there.</v>

3141
02:09:41.110 --> 02:09:45.700
<v Speaker 2>He was jacked and so big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was when he fought cabbage.</v>

3142
02:09:45.850 --> 02:09:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Beat the fuck out of cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was backstage when he fought randy and</v>

3143
02:09:49.361 --> 02:09:51.640
<v Speaker 2>remember randy got him knocked out</v>
<v Speaker 2>within like 20 seconds.</v>

3144
02:09:51.641 --> 02:09:54.610
<v Speaker 2>He had him on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went through a crazy punch and branded</v>

3145
02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:56.530
<v Speaker 2>it and tim didn't see coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

3146
02:09:56.590 --> 02:09:58.090
<v Speaker 2>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3147
02:09:58.091 --> 02:10:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim was friends with Randy,</v>

3148
02:10:00.581 --> 02:10:04.780
<v Speaker 2>so he was really shocked that a randy</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to fight him in the first place</v>

3149
02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:07.780
<v Speaker 2>and that was when randy was a light</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight.</v>

3150
02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Tim was heavyweight and randy hit him</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a fake inside leg kick and a giant</v>

3151
02:10:12.761 --> 02:10:16.390
<v Speaker 2>bottle of an overhand right right away</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tim didn't even know what the fuck</v>

3152
02:10:16.391 --> 02:10:18.700
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was out on his feet and he came back</v>

3153
02:10:18.701 --> 02:10:20.350
<v Speaker 2>to that locker room is I was all</v>
<v Speaker 2>swollen.</v>

3154
02:10:20.351 --> 02:10:22.060
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

3155
02:10:22.061 --> 02:10:24.030
<v Speaker 2>I just saw you two minutes ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>

3156
02:10:24.370 --> 02:10:25.790
<v Speaker 2>That's the fight game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3157
02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:27.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a fight game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3158
02:10:27.461 --> 02:10:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Tim Silvia doesn't get enough love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really doesn't.</v>

3159
02:10:30.070 --> 02:10:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Now I see him now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just enormous.</v>

3160
02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Three hundred 71 pounds.</v>

3161
02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:36.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this a recent one?</v>

3162
02:10:37.970 --> 02:10:40.760
<v Speaker 3>When is this from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's fighting anymore.</v>

3163
02:10:40.770 --> 02:10:42.560
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does a lot of bowhunting now.</v>

3164
02:10:42.561 --> 02:10:47.090
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what he does with</v>
<v Speaker 3>medically unfit to two years ago,</v>

3165
02:10:47.570 --> 02:10:51.320
<v Speaker 3>ruled medically unfit to compete and</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality fighting because it was 371</v>

3166
02:10:51.321 --> 02:10:52.131
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See?</v>

3167
02:10:52.131 --> 02:10:52.964
<v Speaker 3>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

3168
02:10:53.190 --> 02:10:56.870
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means he gained a hundred 10 pounds</v>

3169
02:10:56.871 --> 02:10:58.560
<v Speaker 3>from the time he was in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

3170
02:10:58.770 --> 02:10:59.630
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not good.</v>

3171
02:11:01.070 --> 02:11:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Not good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when he was at his best,</v>

3172
02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:08.540
<v Speaker 3>he's a very under appreciated</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight.</v>

3173
02:11:08.810 --> 02:11:12.600
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think I hope I people being</v>

3174
02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:15.950
<v Speaker 3>friends with these people has helped me</v>
<v Speaker 3>out so much in regular life and they</v>

3175
02:11:15.951 --> 02:11:18.410
<v Speaker 3>talk about a lot how this carries over</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it really,</v>

3176
02:11:18.411 --> 02:11:20.120
<v Speaker 3>really does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way they carry themselves,</v>

3177
02:11:20.450 --> 02:11:22.190
<v Speaker 3>the way they think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Matt always said,</v>

3178
02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:24.380
<v Speaker 3>for every move there's a counter for</v>
<v Speaker 3>every counter,</v>

3179
02:11:24.381 --> 02:11:27.770
<v Speaker 3>there's a counter and that's the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing where like if you're going to move</v>

3180
02:11:27.771 --> 02:11:29.720
<v Speaker 3>someone in your career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to leave some blank</v>

3181
02:11:29.721 --> 02:11:34.520
<v Speaker 3>exposed and you have to become less risk</v>
<v Speaker 3>averse and make that shot and sometimes</v>

3182
02:11:34.521 --> 02:11:36.920
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna make that shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you still have to go for it.</v>

3183
02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:40.130
<v Speaker 3>Just because you see the dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean there's always going to be</v>

3184
02:11:40.131 --> 02:11:42.050
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to fucking go for it.</v>

3185
02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:45.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely some lessons to be</v>

3186
02:11:45.621 --> 02:11:49.520
<v Speaker 3>learned from all martial arts training</v>
<v Speaker 3>that what I've always said is this.</v>

3187
02:11:49.521 --> 02:11:53.230
<v Speaker 3>Something that I learned from my</v>
<v Speaker 3>earliest taekwondo instructor was the</v>

3188
02:11:54.170 --> 02:11:58.010
<v Speaker 3>taekwondo and all martial arts are</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially a veil of vehicle for human</v>

3189
02:11:58.160 --> 02:11:59.450
<v Speaker 3>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Devo,</v>

3190
02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:03.290
<v Speaker 3>developing your human potential and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>these difficult things that you do,</v>

3191
02:12:03.291 --> 02:12:06.260
<v Speaker 3>if you can overcome them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll find lessons in those that you</v>

3192
02:12:06.261 --> 02:12:09.050
<v Speaker 3>could apply to business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Personal relationships.</v>

3193
02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:11.120
<v Speaker 3>Like anything life throws at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3194
02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:12.350
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also,</v>

3195
02:12:12.580 --> 02:12:14.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a North Korean story.</v>

3196
02:12:14.031 --> 02:12:16.790
<v Speaker 3>We're in 1978,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there were,</v>

3197
02:12:16.791 --> 02:12:19.070
<v Speaker 3>there in the DMZ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the border between north and South Korea</v>

3198
02:12:19.071 --> 02:12:21.830
<v Speaker 3>and the Americans wanted to chop down a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tree or to prune it.</v>

3199
02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:24.860
<v Speaker 3>And the North Koreans took their ax and</v>
<v Speaker 3>chop them up and killed them.</v>

3200
02:12:24.860 --> 02:12:26.660
<v Speaker 3>That acs is on display now in North</v>
<v Speaker 3>Korea.</v>

3201
02:12:26.661 --> 02:12:28.760
<v Speaker 3>I saw it chopped up the Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

3202
02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:31.030
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they boast that they use taekwondo dell</v>

3203
02:12:31.250 --> 02:12:33.260
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to conquer these greater numbers of</v>

3204
02:12:33.261 --> 02:12:34.850
<v Speaker 3>Americans because it's a Korean martial</v>
<v Speaker 3>art.</v>

3205
02:12:34.930 --> 02:12:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3206
02:12:35.870 --> 02:12:38.120
<v Speaker 3>They did it because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not chopping down this tree fund.</v>

3207
02:12:38.121 --> 02:12:41.240
<v Speaker 3>So they killed them because they wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>to chop down a tree and they Americans</v>

3208
02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:45.290
<v Speaker 3>launched Operation Paul Bunyan and came</v>
<v Speaker 3>back with like 200 guys and carriers.</v>

3209
02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:47.360
<v Speaker 3>We look at job at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this trade and is,</v>

3210
02:12:47.380 --> 02:12:50.570
<v Speaker 3>did they left the stump to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

3211
02:12:50.810 --> 02:12:52.820
<v Speaker 3>America?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3212
02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:54.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3213
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:59.350
<v Speaker 3>I think the real issue with fighters is</v>
<v Speaker 3>making sure that they recognize that</v>

3214
02:12:59.511 --> 02:13:04.511
<v Speaker 3>father time is real and that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>expiration date is real and that there's</v>

3215
02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:07.520
<v Speaker 3>only a certain amount of punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The physical frame,</v>

3216
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:10.550
<v Speaker 3>your meat vehicle that you're carrying</v>
<v Speaker 3>through this life can endure.</v>

3217
02:13:10.730 --> 02:13:12.920
<v Speaker 3>And then after awhile it's downhill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3218
02:13:12.980 --> 02:13:15.500
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that hit close to home for me because I</v>

3219
02:13:15.501 --> 02:13:17.060
<v Speaker 3>always wanted to have abs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3220
02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:19.940
<v Speaker 3>And let's not laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Joe Rogan,</v>

3221
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:23.390
<v Speaker 3>I work with my coach Dick Talents and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

3222
02:13:23.391 --> 02:13:25.400
<v Speaker 3>I can get you to abs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got me to abs.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What's the.</v>

3225
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote an article about how getting out</v>

3226
02:13:29.061 --> 02:13:31.000
<v Speaker 3>changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

3227
02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:34.620
<v Speaker 3>Here's the spoiler was zero positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>outcome.</v>

3228
02:13:34.830 --> 02:13:36.070
<v Speaker 3>I put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put the APP,</v>

3229
02:13:36.090 --> 02:13:37.800
<v Speaker 3>vote on tinder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one fucking cared,</v>

3230
02:13:38.130 --> 02:13:43.130
<v Speaker 3>but now I have to maintain them or else</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be the men and decline and</v>

3231
02:13:43.351 --> 02:13:45.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm losing my peak,</v>

3232
02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:47.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's something that every guy goes</v>

3233
02:13:47.161 --> 02:13:49.170
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now I'm in this fucking trap of</v>

3234
02:13:49.171 --> 02:13:51.000
<v Speaker 3>having to stick by this fucking regimen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3235
02:13:51.001 --> 02:13:51.960
<v Speaker 3>well I can help you right there.</v>

3236
02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:53.400
<v Speaker 3>How's that starts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way you're looking at it,</v>

3237
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:58.260
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at it like it's trap</v>
<v Speaker 3>expectations that must be maintained,</v>

3238
02:13:58.290 --> 02:14:00.300
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just a mind trap.</v>

3239
02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Will have in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just not.</v>

3240
02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:03.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>

3241
02:14:03.601 --> 02:14:08.601
<v Speaker 3>You could instead look only towards</v>
<v Speaker 3>always improving and don't ever think of</v>

3242
02:14:08.611 --> 02:14:11.970
<v Speaker 3>it as a trap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of it as a perpetual life like</v>

3243
02:14:12.450 --> 02:14:14.400
<v Speaker 3>path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh sure I am improving at.</v>

3244
02:14:14.401 --> 02:14:17.620
<v Speaker 3>The point is I can't be like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Body fat can increase a certain policy.</v>

3245
02:14:17.621 --> 02:14:19.830
<v Speaker 3>That's like what people do like you hear</v>
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>

3246
02:14:19.831 --> 02:14:23.070
<v Speaker 3>When people become famous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when they become famous or become</v>

3247
02:14:23.071 --> 02:14:25.080
<v Speaker 3>wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get panicky and they want to cling</v>

3248
02:14:25.081 --> 02:14:29.940
<v Speaker 3>to isolate and insulate themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They lose what got them.</v>

3249
02:14:29.941 --> 02:14:33.180
<v Speaker 3>They become risk averse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They lose what got them to the dance in</v>

3250
02:14:33.181 --> 02:14:35.370
<v Speaker 3>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My abs did not get me to any dance.</v>

3251
02:14:35.380 --> 02:14:35.880
<v Speaker 3>They Florida.</v>

3252
02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:36.750
<v Speaker 3>They should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3253
02:14:36.751 --> 02:14:39.180
<v Speaker 3>they showed them to the right people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a single guy.</v>

3254
02:14:39.270 --> 02:14:40.950
<v Speaker 3>I am a desperate yes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What are you gonna do when you're out</v>
<v Speaker 3>here and hanging out with my buddy matt,</v>

3305
02:16:28.580 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 3>who you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an internet</v>

3306
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:33.730
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to do just some work and</v>

3307
02:16:33.731 --> 02:16:36.010
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just experienced life on the west coast.</v>

3308
02:16:36.090 --> 02:16:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an la fan to know what bothers</v>
<v Speaker 1>you about.</v>

3309
02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:41.620
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain corruption about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corruption.</v>

3310
02:16:41.621 --> 02:16:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's a veneer of sunshine</v>

3311
02:16:45.071 --> 02:16:47.690
<v Speaker 1>and stability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but underneath that there's a lot of a</v>

3312
02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:53.070
<v Speaker 1>fakeness and and nastiness and I new</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yorkers were more direct and more</v>

3313
02:16:54.071 --> 02:16:55.750
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

3314
02:16:55.751 --> 02:16:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Fakeness and nastiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How so?</v>

3315
02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Meaning like when I meet people in La</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

3316
02:17:00.491 --> 02:17:01.121
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an author.</v>

3317
02:17:01.121 --> 02:17:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm sorry I haven't heard any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your books.</v>

3318
02:17:03.011 --> 02:17:03.761
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck are you?</v>

3319
02:17:03.761 --> 02:17:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm nobody.</v>

3320
02:17:04.540 --> 02:17:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that kind of thing.</v>

3321
02:17:06.190 --> 02:17:07.990
<v Speaker 1>So they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're scared of offending someone in</v>

3322
02:17:07.991 --> 02:17:11.950
<v Speaker 1>case that might be important</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's like we should definitely grab</v>

3323
02:17:11.951 --> 02:17:13.540
<v Speaker 1>lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning good to see you,</v>

3324
02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:15.550
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean literally we should</v>
<v Speaker 1>grab lunch.</v>

3325
02:17:15.550 --> 02:17:20.500
<v Speaker 1>It's all these codes that you could find</v>
<v Speaker 1>a losers like that New York to pull.</v>

3326
02:17:20.501 --> 02:17:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hanging out with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they met the wrong people in la.</v>

3327
02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Are you meeting them then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

3328
02:17:25.421 --> 02:17:26.021
<v Speaker 1>In New York?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3329
02:17:26.021 --> 02:17:27.430
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're generalizing like you're</v>

3330
02:17:27.431 --> 02:17:29.680
<v Speaker 1>generalizing these people that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting that they're worried about</v>

3331
02:17:29.681 --> 02:17:31.150
<v Speaker 1>offending you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it.</v>

3332
02:17:31.380 --> 02:17:33.910
<v Speaker 1>It's happened enough that it's part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture here.</v>

3333
02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:36.610
<v Speaker 1>It's not just one data point Joe Rogan</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just like.</v>

3334
02:17:36.780 --> 02:17:40.150
<v Speaker 1>It's jarring to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not used to it from Brooklyn.</v>

3335
02:17:40.151 --> 02:17:41.860
<v Speaker 1>You're a big fan of that data point</v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

3336
02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:42.810
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3337
02:17:42.810 --> 02:17:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3338
02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:47.170
<v Speaker 1>but you're limited data points and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people you meet.</v>

3339
02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:49.210
<v Speaker 1>How often are you here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 4 million,</v>

3340
02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:50.870
<v Speaker 1>25.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>

3341
02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:54.010
<v Speaker 1>How often do you here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For like once a year.</v>

3342
02:17:54.140 --> 02:17:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the thing about La is there's</v>

3343
02:17:57.730 --> 02:18:01.480
<v Speaker 1>pockets of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these voices of interesting people</v>

3344
02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:02.530
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3345
02:18:02.530 --> 02:18:04.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm a cultivator of interesting people.</v>

3346
02:18:04.510 --> 02:18:06.700
<v Speaker 1>I like to like when I find them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cleaned to them.</v>

3347
02:18:06.701 --> 02:18:08.410
<v Speaker 1>The problem is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my approach.</v>

3348
02:18:08.411 --> 02:18:10.660
<v Speaker 1>There's always someone that's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into that group.</v>

3349
02:18:10.690 --> 02:18:12.550
<v Speaker 1>That's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3350
02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Entry Ism.</v>

3351
02:18:13.810 --> 02:18:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

3352
02:18:15.940 --> 02:18:18.130
<v Speaker 1>and that they bring their crew and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a.</v>

3353
02:18:18.131 --> 02:18:20.560
<v Speaker 1>it's infected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3354
02:18:20.561 --> 02:18:24.220
<v Speaker 1>It becomes an issue and especially</v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst comedians becomes an issue.</v>

3355
02:18:24.250 --> 02:18:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to work with you and do shows</v>

3356
02:18:26.711 --> 02:18:27.850
<v Speaker 1>with you and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

3357
02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:29.770
<v Speaker 1>hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same happened.</v>

3358
02:18:29.771 --> 02:18:30.340
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3359
02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I did two books with dl Hughley who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>also an amazingly wonderful person and I</v>

3360
02:18:36.371 --> 02:18:39.350
<v Speaker 1>didn't see that much around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he hangs with their various crew.</v>

3361
02:18:39.380 --> 02:18:41.050
<v Speaker 1>He's very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>

3362
02:18:41.470 --> 02:18:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot from him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not suffering any fools.</v>

3363
02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:45.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3364
02:18:45.011 --> 02:18:47.860
<v Speaker 1>And it's also really fun being the white</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy with a group of black people going</v>

3365
02:18:47.861 --> 02:18:49.120
<v Speaker 1>to a club or something like that.</v>

3366
02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:54.070
<v Speaker 1>And then when she use the n word I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the chapter in the first book</v>

3367
02:18:54.071 --> 02:18:56.710
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which book that I did two books with</v>

3368
02:18:56.711 --> 02:18:58.420
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first call I want you to shut the</v>

3369
02:18:58.421 --> 02:18:59.780
<v Speaker 1>fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

3370
02:18:59.870 --> 02:19:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Uncle Sam on the cover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the book I want you to shut the</v>

3371
02:19:03.791 --> 02:19:05.110
<v Speaker 1>fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is hilarious.</v>

3372
02:19:05.111 --> 02:19:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Title for a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second one's called black man.</v>

3373
02:19:07.241 --> 02:19:10.510
<v Speaker 1>White House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came up with both those titles and</v>

3374
02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:12.900
<v Speaker 1>their and I want you to shut the fuck up</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a very good time.</v>

3375
02:19:12.901 --> 02:19:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I want you to shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's Uncle Sam on the kind of.</v>

3376
02:19:16.630 --> 02:19:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot from him.</v>

3377
02:19:18.401 --> 02:19:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a great,</v>

3378

3379
02:19:20.710 --> 02:19:23.020
<v Speaker 1>he's a good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a decent guy.</v>

3380
02:19:23.410 --> 02:19:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm sure you know all the comedians</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who were the assholes behind the</v>

3381
02:19:26.141 --> 02:19:28.730
<v Speaker 1>scenes and who aren't and don't think</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone thinks badly of him.</v>

3382
02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:30.740
<v Speaker 1>He's very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas this hardness sleeve.</v>

3383
02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:31.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3384
02:19:31.611 --> 02:19:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Deal that well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've run into him a few times and had</v>

3385
02:19:33.891 --> 02:19:35.870
<v Speaker 1>good conversations with him and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>always been very nice,</v>

3386
02:19:36.290 --> 02:19:38.240
<v Speaker 1>but you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever hear bad things.</v>

3387
02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:41.180
<v Speaker 1>He's a mench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A mench is interesting.</v>

3388
02:19:41.590 --> 02:19:46.150
<v Speaker 1>I want to know is that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually have a blowup of that firm.</v>

3389
02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:50.230
<v Speaker 1>We did a book signing and he signed it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me over my instructions to my Nigga</v>

3390
02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Michael Nicholas piece pimping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hanging up in the house.</v>

3391
02:19:52.431 --> 02:19:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that great?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's my name,</v>

3392
02:19:53.330 --> 02:19:56.780
<v Speaker 1>little desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Audacity of dopes is ruining America.</v>

3393
02:19:56.781 --> 02:19:59.030
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love how you can say fuck,</v>

3394
02:19:59.031 --> 02:20:02.450
<v Speaker 1>as long as you put it in like a pound</v>
<v Speaker 1>sign for the you will.</v>

3395
02:20:02.451 --> 02:20:05.750
<v Speaker 1>They wanted a curse because there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>book called go the fuck to sleep,</v>

3396

<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3399
02:20:10.490 --> 02:20:14.120
<v Speaker 1>so offensive to me that you can cover up</v>
<v Speaker 1>one letter and everybody's like,</v>

3400
02:20:14.121 --> 02:20:14.930
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3402
02:20:16.041 --> 02:20:19.430
<v Speaker 1>new book's going to call fuck whales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck whales and all these other</v>

3403
02:20:19.431 --> 02:20:21.810
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know an f f has a pound signs like,</v>

3404
02:20:21.811 --> 02:20:23.990
<v Speaker 1>oh well this is spot and I'll put this</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the shelf in the supermarket.</v>

3405
02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3406
02:20:24.990 --> 02:20:26.990
<v Speaker 1>You could just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such child.</v>

3407
02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:30.470
<v Speaker 1>No language has changed because we used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not be able to say fuck.</v>

3408
02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:32.990
<v Speaker 1>And now we can't say the n word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's when we were kids it was,</v>

3409
02:20:32.991 --> 02:20:33.890
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the problem.</v>

3410
02:20:33.900 --> 02:20:36.290
<v Speaker 1>You'd never seen writing ever while you</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

3411
02:20:36.350 --> 02:20:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Did Archie Bunker's say the n word on</v>
<v Speaker 1>all in the family?</v>

3412
02:20:39.051 --> 02:20:41.060
<v Speaker 1>He must have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine he did.</v>

3413
02:20:41.061 --> 02:20:46.061
<v Speaker 1>I know that a Fred Redd Foxx did redd</v>
<v Speaker 1>foxx did on Sanford and sons because I</v>

3414
02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:51.220
<v Speaker 1>remember I remember him saying it about</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3415
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:53.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like a jury.</v>

3416
02:20:53.850 --> 02:20:56.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like during a trial or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

3417
02:20:58.190 --> 02:21:00.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember what the line</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

3418
02:21:00.290 --> 02:21:02.900
<v Speaker 1>but it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said the last time I saw this many</v>

3419
02:21:02.901 --> 02:21:05.600
<v Speaker 1>niggers was in a Tarzan movie and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3420
02:21:05.930 --> 02:21:08.000
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they put that on tv?</v>

3421
02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:11.540
<v Speaker 1>But it was a different world and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red Fox who's by the way,</v>

3422
02:21:11.541 --> 02:21:15.770
<v Speaker 1>like almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean him and Richard Pryor.</v>

3423
02:21:15.850 --> 02:21:20.210
<v Speaker 1>We're like one of two of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important figures of like black standup</v>

3424
02:21:20.211 --> 02:21:22.160
<v Speaker 1>comedy of any standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3425
02:21:22.220 --> 02:21:24.260
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the comedians are the ones who</v>

3426
02:21:24.261 --> 02:21:28.010
<v Speaker 1>are always pushing the envelope and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's their job and it enrages me when</v>

3427
02:21:28.011 --> 02:21:29.570
<v Speaker 1>people are trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not fun.</v>

3428
02:21:29.610 --> 02:21:32.150
<v Speaker 1>I have my next book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this whole chapter about that's</v>

3429
02:21:32.151 --> 02:21:33.620
<v Speaker 1>not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like I knew a North Korean</v>

3430
02:21:33.621 --> 02:21:36.860
<v Speaker 1>refugee and he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went to high school here and he'd be</v>

3431
02:21:36.861 --> 02:21:38.210
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with his friends and they'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

3432
02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember when we were kids there was</v>

3433
02:21:39.501 --> 02:21:40.040
<v Speaker 1>pokemon.</v>

3434
02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:40.851
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3435
02:21:40.851 --> 02:21:43.700
<v Speaker 1>except instead of Pokemon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched my debts starve to death along</v>

3436
02:21:43.701 --> 02:21:47.570
<v Speaker 1>with most of my village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have that dark sense of humor.</v>

3437
02:21:47.600 --> 02:21:49.820
<v Speaker 1>He joked around about that because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to,</v>

3438
02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:51.020
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come from that culture.</v>

3439
02:21:51.021 --> 02:21:53.750
<v Speaker 1>If you don't laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be able to kind of</v>

3440
02:21:53.751 --> 02:21:56.030
<v Speaker 1>deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to tell him he can't</v>

3441
02:21:56.031 --> 02:21:57.770
<v Speaker 1>joke about starbuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his starving family.</v>

3442
02:21:57.771 --> 02:21:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did that guy get out?</v>

3443
02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:00.411
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3444
02:22:00.411 --> 02:22:02.930
<v Speaker 1>he escaped to China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was basically a slave.</v>

3445
02:22:02.931 --> 02:22:05.570
<v Speaker 1>A woman kind of found him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a Christian.</v>

3446
02:22:05.571 --> 02:22:08.480
<v Speaker 1>There's a bit Christian population in</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and then it's a whole process.</v>

3447
02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you escape the China?</v>

3448
02:22:10.191 --> 02:22:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Did he bribed the guards in the middle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the day?</v>

3449
02:22:12.891 --> 02:22:15.810
<v Speaker 1>He just crossed the Tumen River and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just happen not to see him,</v>

3450
02:22:15.811 --> 02:22:16.644
<v Speaker 1>but he's a kid.</v>

3451
02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:18.110
<v Speaker 1>How old was he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3452
02:22:18.111 --> 02:22:21.080
<v Speaker 1>he was under 16 and over 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in that range.</v>

3453
02:22:21.170 --> 02:22:24.260
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone from your family escapes,</v>

3454
02:22:24.261 --> 02:22:26.610
<v Speaker 1>your whole family's punished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the great leader,</v>

3455
02:22:26.611 --> 02:22:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Kim Il Sung said class enemies must be</v>
<v Speaker 1>exterminated.</v>

3456
02:22:29.731 --> 02:22:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three generations.</v>

3457
02:22:31.140 --> 02:22:33.780
<v Speaker 1>So in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people like Rick Santorum say the</v>

3458
02:22:33.781 --> 02:22:36.600
<v Speaker 1>families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic unit of society unit means</v>

3459
02:22:36.601 --> 02:22:39.540
<v Speaker 1>that which can't be subdivided further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put that into practice.</v>

3460
02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:41.700
<v Speaker 1>So if someone from your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong,</v>

3461
02:22:41.701 --> 02:22:45.030
<v Speaker 1>three generations are punished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if someone escapes,</v>

3462
02:22:45.210 --> 02:22:47.610
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be really bad for use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They often get fake.</v>

3463
02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:49.380
<v Speaker 1>They bribed someone to get a fake death</v>
<v Speaker 1>certificate.</v>

3464
02:22:50.930 --> 02:22:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So someone escapes your parents and then</v>

3465
02:22:55.140 --> 02:22:58.140
<v Speaker 1>grandparents were kids or siblings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids or anybody.</v>

3466
02:22:58.141 --> 02:23:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Whoever the fuck can be around is</v>
<v Speaker 1>imprisoned or deported to some</v>

3467
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:04.620
<v Speaker 1>countryside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're in Pyongyang,</v>

3468
02:23:05.460 --> 02:23:07.710
<v Speaker 1>there's something called Sung Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a caste system,</v>

3469
02:23:07.711 --> 02:23:08.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3470
02:23:08.190 --> 02:23:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Which has three layers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how loyal you are to the</v>

3471
02:23:10.591 --> 02:23:13.680
<v Speaker 1>government and that determines where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can live in the country and what your</v>

3472
02:23:13.681 --> 02:23:15.780
<v Speaker 1>job could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not allowed to step foot in</v>

3473
02:23:15.781 --> 02:23:18.360
<v Speaker 1>the capital city unless you're loyal to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the regime.</v>

3474
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:21.660
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is if you're from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pyongyang and you defect,</v>

3475
02:23:21.930 --> 02:23:24.270
<v Speaker 1>your family's going to get sent to Lex</v>
<v Speaker 1>bumble,</v>

3476
02:23:24.271 --> 02:23:24.960
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3477
02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:27.090
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you've got to raise rice and</v>

3478
02:23:27.091 --> 02:23:30.690
<v Speaker 1>anyone from North Korea who's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambassador,</v>

3479
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:33.870
<v Speaker 1>they have family back there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So make sure that you don't make any</v>

3480
02:23:33.871 --> 02:23:35.910
<v Speaker 1>mistakes and try to stay in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

3481
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have layers upon layers of control.</v>

3482
02:23:39.751 --> 02:23:41.700
<v Speaker 1>They're brilliant at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrific,</v>

3483
02:23:41.701 --> 02:23:42.511
<v Speaker 1>but brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3484
02:23:42.511 --> 02:23:43.231
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3485
02:23:43.231 --> 02:23:45.030
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are really the supermind</v>

3486
02:23:45.031 --> 02:23:47.250
<v Speaker 1>master,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the super villains of our time,</v>

3487
02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:49.800
<v Speaker 1>horrific and its execution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but brilliant.</v>

3488
02:23:49.860 --> 02:23:52.800
<v Speaker 1>And it's the whole master plan of it.</v>

3489
02:23:53.910 --> 02:23:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they tell people don't wear ripped</v>

3490
02:23:56.281 --> 02:24:00.300
<v Speaker 1>jeans to the DMZ because North Korea</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes these photos and shows US citizens</v>

3491
02:24:00.301 --> 02:24:03.030
<v Speaker 1>go look before the rest of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world dressed in rags.</v>

3492
02:24:03.430 --> 02:24:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a brilliant,</v>

3493
02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:06.810
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely brilliant.</v>

3494
02:24:06.870 --> 02:24:10.770
<v Speaker 1>It is Alaris that were so wealthy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America that we buy jeans that are</v>

3495
02:24:10.771 --> 02:24:15.090
<v Speaker 1>already scratched up or like acid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's just put acid on your genes.</v>

3496
02:24:15.091 --> 02:24:15.960
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

3497
02:24:16.020 --> 02:24:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I was watching this video online about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they make those,</v>

3498
02:24:19.430 --> 02:24:21.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the word that they use for</v>

3499
02:24:21.580 --> 02:24:26.120
<v Speaker 1>distress is stress where they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking like a sander blasting and she's</v>

3500
02:24:26.130 --> 02:24:27.480
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are we doing?</v>

3501
02:24:27.770 --> 02:24:30.150
<v Speaker 1>I went into this whole gene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a phase.</v>

3502
02:24:30.151 --> 02:24:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I got 30 pairs because I thought it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>

3503
02:24:32.071 --> 02:24:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I started collecting them and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>

3504
02:24:34.860 --> 02:24:36.690
<v Speaker 1>The point is when they're raw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wear them,</v>

3505
02:24:36.691 --> 02:24:38.640
<v Speaker 1>the ink breaks down and they distress in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own.</v>

3506
02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:42.660
<v Speaker 1>They get these cool fades and I wore my</v>
<v Speaker 1>best pair to like this fancy denim store</v>

3507
02:24:42.661 --> 02:24:45.330
<v Speaker 1>in La and no one praise me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I know one praised you upset.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3510
02:24:51.090 --> 02:24:52.440

3511
02:24:52.441 --> 02:24:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Japanese do at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like two years ago,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is.</v>

3514

<v Speaker 1>That person is a person that a person is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fruit,</v>

02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:26.560
<v Speaker 3>genes that you're worried about being</v>
<v Speaker 3>praised for.</v>

<v Speaker 3>praised for your clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't imagine that would be your</v>

3592
02:27:59.471 --> 02:28:01.060
<v Speaker 3>best choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3594
02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:06.910
<v Speaker 3>on Fox all the time and I'm probably one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the best dressed people network.</v>

3595
02:28:07.150 --> 02:28:09.130
<v Speaker 3>Do you enjoy being on Fox?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3598
02:28:11.650 --> 02:28:15.490
<v Speaker 3>Because I get to be the same thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets me in trouble at parties and I'm</v>

3599
02:28:15.491 --> 02:28:17.650
<v Speaker 3>rewarded for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the thing that gets you in</v>

3600
02:28:17.651 --> 02:28:19.240
<v Speaker 3>trouble at parties?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vicious?</v>

3601
02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this rating denigrating</v>

3602
02:28:22.370 --> 02:28:24.410
<v Speaker 1>all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the nasty.</v>

3603
02:28:24.411 --> 02:28:25.930
<v Speaker 1>It's so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

3604
02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:28.280
<v Speaker 1>why do you like doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think there's a lot of</v>

3605
02:28:28.281 --> 02:28:31.160
<v Speaker 1>horrible people and they need to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>called out on their bullshit and I'm in</v>

3606
02:28:31.161 --> 02:28:34.970
<v Speaker 1>a position to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of arguments do you have on</v>

3607
02:28:34.971 --> 02:28:36.340
<v Speaker 1>file?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen you on Fox for.</v>

3608
02:28:36.350 --> 02:28:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch too much.</v>

3609
02:28:38.110 --> 02:28:38.990
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3610
02:28:38.991 --> 02:28:40.400
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like if I'm talking about</v>

3611
02:28:40.401 --> 02:28:42.160
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always make it a point to be as</v>

3612
02:28:42.350 --> 02:28:44.630
<v Speaker 1>denigrating and humiliate and to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally as possible.</v>

3613
02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:46.250
<v Speaker 1>But when you're talking to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>

3614
02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:48.050
<v Speaker 1>not personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're talking about them.</v>

3615
02:28:48.051 --> 02:28:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the issue is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not usually in paddle actual</v>

3616
02:28:50.001 --> 02:28:52.310
<v Speaker 1>politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on with John Bolton ones,</v>

3617
02:28:52.311 --> 02:28:54.470
<v Speaker 1>which was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I go,</v>

3618
02:28:54.530 --> 02:28:55.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm shopping for blood,</v>

3619
02:28:56.060 --> 02:28:57.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these types,</v>

3620
02:28:57.460 --> 02:29:01.490
<v Speaker 1>someone's got to be Batman and punching</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people in the face metaphorically.</v>

3621
02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Metaphorically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3622
02:29:03.020 --> 02:29:06.400
<v Speaker 1>So you enjoy it because it gives you an</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to intervene.</v>

3623
02:29:06.650 --> 02:29:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send a message home to will it to be</v>

3624
02:29:09.020 --> 02:29:10.010
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I'm good at,</v>

3625
02:29:10.011 --> 02:29:12.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's not culturally socially</v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable.</v>

3626
02:29:12.561 --> 02:29:15.980
<v Speaker 1>This is why I don't drink because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid you're going to be more mean.</v>

3627
02:29:15.981 --> 02:29:16.980
<v Speaker 1>I got meaner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3628
02:29:17.420 --> 02:29:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is I'm really funny for</v>

3629
02:29:20.841 --> 02:29:23.480
<v Speaker 1>people who just listen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gave me like the sideways looking</v>

3630
02:29:23.481 --> 02:29:24.470
<v Speaker 1>through your eyebrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3631
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:26.810
<v Speaker 1>But that's the thing like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

3632
02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:27.500
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

3633
02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:29.570
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mouth is very quick so I'll have that</v>

3634
02:29:29.571 --> 02:29:32.270
<v Speaker 1>good line and the next day I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person's going to feel like shit</v>

3635
02:29:32.271 --> 02:29:34.210
<v Speaker 1>and I shouldn't have said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3636
02:29:34.310 --> 02:29:35.890
<v Speaker 1>And that they don't deserve that at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>

3637
02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:39.410
<v Speaker 1>But you're meant it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the time I met the joke,</v>

3638
02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:41.360
<v Speaker 1>it came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the joke landed.</v>

3639
02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing about hanging out with</v>

3640
02:29:43.281 --> 02:29:44.960
<v Speaker 1>comedians to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3641
02:29:44.961 --> 02:29:46.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of comics that I know,</v>

3642
02:29:46.540 --> 02:29:49.280
<v Speaker 1>but you can kind of get away with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could shit on a comic and if</v>

3643
02:29:49.281 --> 02:29:51.950
<v Speaker 1>it's funny they'll laugh with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's a regular person,</v>

3644
02:29:51.951 --> 02:29:53.820
<v Speaker 1>especially a female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do that.</v>

3645
02:29:54.170 --> 02:29:57.640
<v Speaker 1>They don't deserve it at all and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty for a long time and I shouldn't</v>

3646
02:29:57.641 --> 02:29:59.360
<v Speaker 1>feel guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should feel guilty,</v>

3647
02:29:59.390 --> 02:30:01.130
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're not used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3648
02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:03.140
<v Speaker 1>And especially if they come at you</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

3649
02:30:03.170 --> 02:30:05.150
<v Speaker 1>oh my friends tell me I'm funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>well you started the wrong fucking war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3651
02:30:08.840 --> 02:30:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they could make fun of your genes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it really hurt you.</v>

3652
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:14.630
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't have those sheebu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't have the language to do so</v>

3653
02:30:14.690 --> 02:30:15.650
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't know the language.</v>

3654
02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Shibu is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it that obscure?</v>

3655
02:30:19.220 --> 02:30:19.671
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ted,</v>

3656
02:30:19.671 --> 02:30:21.320
<v Speaker 1>you heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything man.</v>

3657
02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:23.450
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know the rules to</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball.</v>

3658
02:30:24.690 --> 02:30:25.523
<v Speaker 1>Khaki.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was.</v>

3659
02:30:25.730 --> 02:30:28.340
<v Speaker 1>The reason why those jeans are awesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because they're obscure.</v>

3660
02:30:28.490 --> 02:30:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of those guys.</v>

3661
02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things rare things are good.</v>

3662
02:30:32.490 --> 02:30:34.730
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred percent.</v>

3663
02:30:34.910 --> 02:30:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Are you a car guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're interested in?</v>

3664
02:30:36.940 --> 02:30:38.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're in New York City.</v>

3665
02:30:38.691 --> 02:30:39.524
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3666
02:30:39.890 --> 02:30:41.600
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at like rare plants.</v>

3667
02:30:41.630 --> 02:30:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Rare fish or you're just in a rare shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like having stuff that's only your own</v>

3668
02:30:46.190 --> 02:30:48.470
<v Speaker 1>because when everyone puts their sticky</v>
<v Speaker 1>fingers on it,</v>

3669
02:30:48.471 --> 02:30:51.830
<v Speaker 1>it ruins it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if you really like something,</v>

<v Speaker 1>be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other people like it as well and become</v>

3671
02:30:53.780 --> 02:30:55.130
<v Speaker 1>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get upset.</v>

02:30:55.131 --> 02:30:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Hell on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you one of those dudes that gets</v>

3673
02:30:56.841 --> 02:30:58.310
<v Speaker 1>bombed out with a bang?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's popular.</v>

3674
02:30:59.060 --> 02:31:02.330
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst thing.</v>

3675
02:31:02.360 --> 02:31:04.380
<v Speaker 1>It hurts me physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really.</v>

3676
02:31:04.381 --> 02:31:05.071
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3677
02:31:05.071 --> 02:31:08.180
<v Speaker 1>It's so silly though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're silly because then stupid people</v>

3678
02:31:08.181 --> 02:31:09.770
<v Speaker 1>are liking what you like and then you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a question.</v>

3679
02:31:09.771 --> 02:31:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Your choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid.</v>

3680
02:31:11.841 --> 02:31:13.850
<v Speaker 1>People like all sorts of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

3681
02:31:13.870 --> 02:31:14.571
<v Speaker 1>But if.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3682
02:31:14.571 --> 02:31:16.760
<v Speaker 1>but incorrectly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like it for the wrong reasons.</v>

3683
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:19.040
<v Speaker 1>What about ice cream with have stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like chocolate ice.</v>

3684
02:31:19.290 --> 02:31:20.100

<v Speaker 3>Robbins and Manhattan trying to find it</v>

3689
02:31:30.211 --> 02:31:32.610
<v Speaker 3>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it drives me crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>your genes are pink.</v>

3705
02:32:18.930 --> 02:32:23.930
<v Speaker 3>They're not paying salmon</v>
<v Speaker 3>pink for people who are struggling with</v>

3706
02:32:24.181 --> 02:32:28.820
<v Speaker 3>their gait thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said salmon is the struggle and</v>

3707
02:32:28.821 --> 02:32:29.640
<v Speaker 3>realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3708
02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:31.620
<v Speaker 3>My struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go over someone's house and they</v>

3709
02:32:31.621 --> 02:32:33.060
<v Speaker 3>have salmon code sheets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>

3710
02:32:34.270 --> 02:32:36.330
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have salmon colored sheets.</v>

3711
02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:38.040
<v Speaker 3>I have lavender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kidding.</v>

3712
02:32:38.041 --> 02:32:38.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kidding.</v>

3713
02:32:38.890 --> 02:32:39.950
<v Speaker 3>Sad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sad,</v>

3714
02:32:40.170 --> 02:32:41.250
<v Speaker 3>sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything black.</v>

3715
02:32:41.251 --> 02:32:43.080
<v Speaker 3>The whole house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the wallpaper.</v>

3716
02:32:43.370 --> 02:32:44.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't have wallpaper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3717
02:32:45.090 --> 02:32:47.280
<v Speaker 3>I think wallpaper is super gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wallpapers.</v>

3718
02:32:47.281 --> 02:32:48.120
<v Speaker 3>Gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think so?</v>

3719
02:32:48.410 --> 02:32:50.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never thought about it.</v>

3720
02:32:50.190 --> 02:32:53.610
<v Speaker 3>I think the first time I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>entertained that thought and my years in</v>

3721
02:32:53.611 --> 02:32:56.130
<v Speaker 3>this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not wallpapered have anything</v>

3722
02:32:56.131 --> 02:33:00.570
<v Speaker 3>to do with your sexual proclivities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's all that designery stuff.</v>

3723
02:33:00.690 --> 02:33:01.523
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3724
02:33:01.900 --> 02:33:03.270
<v Speaker 3>Like the house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's over designed.</v>

3725
02:33:03.271 --> 02:33:03.711
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3726
02:33:03.711 --> 02:33:06.000
<v Speaker 3>what's up with this dude?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people will just really into design</v>

3727
02:33:06.060 --> 02:33:07.710
<v Speaker 3>like chains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3728
02:33:07.711 --> 02:33:09.390
<v Speaker 3>not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so critical.</v>

3729
02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:12.450
<v Speaker 3>Not other people's weird shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your own weird shit.</v>

3730
02:33:12.451 --> 02:33:15.390
<v Speaker 3>You just like you see through a filter</v>
<v Speaker 3>and loving put on blast.</v>

3731
02:33:15.420 --> 02:33:16.470
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating.</v>

3732
02:33:16.530 --> 02:33:17.730
<v Speaker 3>And it'd be both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3733
02:33:17.940 --> 02:33:19.890
<v Speaker 3>It definitely can be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can live your life through these</v>

3734
02:33:19.891 --> 02:33:21.100
<v Speaker 3>contradictions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3735
02:33:21.210 --> 02:33:22.950
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fun life to live.</v>

3736
02:33:23.060 --> 02:33:23.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

3737
02:33:23.920 --> 02:33:27.270
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong to blame me for</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting upset that no one is praising my</v>

3738
02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:28.530
<v Speaker 3>khaki pants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3739
02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:31.230
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I see that you care.</v>

3740
02:33:31.710 --> 02:33:35.790
<v Speaker 3>Like I've never wanted someone to praise</v>
<v Speaker 3>me for a piece of clothing that I wore,</v>

3741
02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:39.000
<v Speaker 3>but maybe since I was like 12 and I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>a kiss tee shirt on,</v>

3742
02:33:39.300 --> 02:33:42.180
<v Speaker 3>I searched so long for them and I got</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last pair on earth.</v>

3743
02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:44.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem in and of itself.</v>

3744
02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:47.550
<v Speaker 3>They even went looking for those fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>salmon disastrous jeans.</v>

3745
02:33:48.500 --> 02:33:50.520
<v Speaker 3>I got 29 other bears that you'd approve</v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

3746
02:33:51.450 --> 02:33:53.520
<v Speaker 3>I got the stainless steel ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

3747
02:33:53.521 --> 02:33:53.821
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

3748
02:33:53.821 --> 02:33:54.420
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait.</v>

3749
02:33:54.420 --> 02:33:56.090
<v Speaker 3>You have stainless steel pants?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3750
02:33:56.190 --> 02:33:58.230
<v Speaker 3>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sustaining steel.</v>

3751
02:33:58.250 --> 02:34:00.890
<v Speaker 3>A cotton weave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who makes sense?</v>

3752
02:34:00.920 --> 02:34:03.540
<v Speaker 3>Naked and famous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like 250 pairs made and I got</v>

3753
02:34:03.541 --> 02:34:04.740
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it look like?</v>

3754
02:34:04.800 --> 02:34:06.450
<v Speaker 3>It's just wrinkly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>

3755
02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:08.620
<v Speaker 3>It's as if you're wearing wet jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're dry.</v>

3756
02:34:08.621 --> 02:34:11.370
<v Speaker 3>That's how it feels like it's stiff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why do they call it stainless steel?</v>

3757
02:34:11.371 --> 02:34:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Because the weave is part 10 percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>stainless steel.</v>

3758
02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:15.630
<v Speaker 3>Ninety percent cotton or the chaperone</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy?</v>

3759
02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:16.590
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not that heavy,</v>

3760
02:34:16.591 --> 02:34:18.790
<v Speaker 3>but they're aren't weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3761
02:34:19.150 --> 02:34:22.900
<v Speaker 3>Pull those up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie stainless steel naked and famous</v>

3762
02:34:22.901 --> 02:34:23.734
<v Speaker 3>jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3763
02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:26.470
<v Speaker 3>That's so odd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like the opposite of barbell</v>

3764
02:34:26.471 --> 02:34:27.160
<v Speaker 3>jeans.</v>

3765
02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:28.550
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>

3766
02:34:28.551 --> 02:34:30.700
<v Speaker 3>You can't throw kicks in them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3767
02:34:30.730 --> 02:34:35.160
<v Speaker 3>And it's was hard to walk in at first</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're walking a robot</v>

3768
02:34:37.300 --> 02:34:40.090
<v Speaker 3>and I actually more than once to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>airport and I got scared.</v>

3769
02:34:40.091 --> 02:34:40.924
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>

3770
02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:41.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>metal detector.</v>

3771
02:34:42.210 --> 02:34:45.550
<v Speaker 3>They don't detect metal anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have those to the pornography pants.</v>

3772
02:34:45.940 --> 02:34:48.820
<v Speaker 3>Pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The inside cuff is a vintage</v>

3773
02:34:48.821 --> 02:34:49.631
<v Speaker 3>pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3774
02:34:49.631 --> 02:34:50.830
<v Speaker 3>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3775
02:34:51.100 --> 02:34:56.100
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if you can control with those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it just looks like newsprint of Qa.</v>

3776
02:34:56.290 --> 02:34:58.380
<v Speaker 3>There's the stainless steel wants to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right of the pinup.</v>

3777
02:34:58.420 --> 02:34:59.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are stainless steel ones.</v>

3778
02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:02.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're just heavy.</v>

3779
02:35:02.980 --> 02:35:05.020
<v Speaker 3>They're stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not actually that heavy.</v>

3780
02:35:07.120 --> 02:35:08.230
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

3781
02:35:08.231 --> 02:35:12.250
<v Speaker 3>So like stainless steel thread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just like a novelty.</v>

3782
02:35:12.540 --> 02:35:14.770
<v Speaker 3>There is no benefit to but they just</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the.</v>

3783
02:35:15.070 --> 02:35:18.370
<v Speaker 3>The wrinkling looks very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The puckering to the fabric.</v>

3784
02:35:18.490 --> 02:35:20.950
<v Speaker 3>You're an interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael is a euphemism,</v>

3785
02:35:20.951 --> 02:35:22.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said that to Jamie for the show.</v>

3786
02:35:22.210 --> 02:35:23.980
<v Speaker 3>So I said something about being</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting and that always means</v>

3787
02:35:23.981 --> 02:35:24.730
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3788
02:35:24.730 --> 02:35:26.560
<v Speaker 3>you're an interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are an interesting guy.</v>

3789
02:35:26.590 --> 02:35:29.860
<v Speaker 3>Like I mean it in the most sincere way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that word can have many</v>

3790
02:35:29.861 --> 02:35:31.980
<v Speaker 3>connotations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can but not.</v>

3791
02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:33.700
<v Speaker 3>It's not how I'm reading it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
