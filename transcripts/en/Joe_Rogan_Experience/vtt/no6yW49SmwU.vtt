<v Speaker 2>literally they stand there and volunteer themselves in the face.</v>

66
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.240
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a street fight like you've seen in the states have used that once.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But I want to play it because it's so,</v>

94
00:02:07.751 --> 00:02:11.050

299
00:07:25.381 --> 00:07:26.214
<v Speaker 1>Big John.</v>

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.211
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to be dead.</v>

301
00:07:27.211 --> 00:07:27.781

309
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.620
<v Speaker 2>the shirt coming off as a strange move.</v>

310
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.470
<v Speaker 2>Cause especially I don't give a fuck move.</v>

311
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.660

319
00:07:52.381 --> 00:07:53.280

320
00:07:53.281 --> 00:07:54.690
<v Speaker 2>His whole thing was that he didn't give a fuck.</v>

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:57.690

00:07:58.621 --> 00:08:00.030
<v Speaker 2>He knows he's fat and love it.</v>

326
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.040
<v Speaker 2>He knows he's not pressing shirt comes off.</v>
