1
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.070
I made some decisions.
This is New Year's Eve.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.180
La Shit's going down.
I made the decision to stop following so many silly fucks,

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.500
fallen too many ridiculous people on Twitter and I look at my timeline.
I'm like,

4
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:20.730
what am I doing with my life?
Boom.
Unfollow Courtney.
Stotten.

5
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.330
Okay,
you're 16 years old.
You ain't got shit to say.
What am I doing?

6
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.820
Did you get down that rabbit hole in the first place?
I can.
I'll fall.

7
00:00:27.821 --> 00:00:30.890
Anybody except people ask me to follow him.
Then I'll never follow him.

8
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.850
This episode of the Joe Rogan expect nothing wrong with little Courtney.

9
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.330
She's a lost girl.
I'm just talking shit and I'm mean a word.
I'm saying.

10
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.250
That's what we do sometimes hear talk.
That's what men do.

11
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.480
Okay,
we can't.

12
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:48.990
You try to start taking me literally for every goddamn thing I say,
who are you?

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.640
How can you not understand subtlety?
This episode is brought to you by on it.

14
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:57.420
That's o.
N.
N.
I.
T.
If you haven't been on it lately,

15
00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:00.690
then you have not seen the earth grown nutrients,

16
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.340
super food,
power,
food,

17
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:09.320
earth grown nutrients,
folks.
That's where it's at.
You know,
there's a,

18
00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:11.580
a thing that I wanted to talk to Ari about,
we'll,
we'll,

19
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:14.850
we'll talk about it on the podcast,
is that vitamin study.
Yup.

20
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.060
But by far the best way to get vitamins and nutrients is from the natural food

21
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:23.880
source,
from the plants,

22
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:28.020
from synthetic vitamins and weirdness like those little blue pills.

23
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.680
Like your body's like,
what the fuck is this dude?

24
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.500
What is this rock you just ate?
Oh,
there's good stuff.
And that rock,

25
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.050
you're lucky if it's a rock even backing down this rock,
how am I break it down?

26
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:44.820
All this nonsense.
But things like earth grown nutrients,
you know,

27
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.780
things like,
uh,
like green superfoods or hemp protein powder,

28
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:52.920
which is by far my favorite protein powder.
The,
the stuff that we sell it on it,

29
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.570
the hemp force protein powders,
first of all,
fucking delicious.

30
00:01:57.571 --> 00:01:58.920
The Vanilla and the chocolate,

31
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:03.900
they're fucking bad ass and to very,
very little sugar.

32
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.560
It's all sweetened with natural sweeteners.

33
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:10.680
It's sweetened with something called Stevia.
And when you taste it,

34
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:13.740
like it doesn't get me,
give me that.
I just ate a bunch of sugar.

35
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.640
I'm a fucking dummy.
Pretended,

36
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.950
eat the protein drink and it's got sugar in it and shit or it,
or even worse,

37
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.970
it's got fake sugar,
some chemical fake sugar.
This is neither.

38
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.070
Stevia is a natural nutrient.
It's not dangerous.
Not gonna fuck you up.

39
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.430
Extract summer leaf.
Yeah,
and it's okay.

40
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.300
I mean it probably fuck you up if you eat too much of it,
but every,
you know,

41
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:38.730
if you ate a pound of salt,
you're a dead fuck.

42
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.420
Do you know that one pound of salt dad really sat down with a pound of salt.

43
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.830
Just started eating it.
You're gone son.
That's a wrap.
You know,

44
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:51.370
you know the hydration dad,
your body just does not want that.
Your,

45
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.940
he's like,
this guy's retarded.
We can't let him breathe.

46
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.880
Eat a pound of fucking salt.
Yeah,
you,
there's,

47
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.160
there's only a certain amount of salt you could eat or your body just shits

48
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:01.510
itself and just boom.

49
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.100
Which is crazy because he see people sprinkled salt on fries.
Nobody ever thinks,

50
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.550
oh my God,
if this guy just sat down and ate a couple of pounds of this stuff,

51
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.770
he would fucking stop being or what the difference,

52
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:15.520
how much table salt you could eat versus how much like natural sea salt.

53
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.590
That's a good question.
That's a good question.

54
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:22.540
Like if you were eating some a Himalayan salt Himalayan salt more than just,

55
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:24.670
cause if it's just sodium chloride iodine,

56
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.230
you're going to fuck yourself up way fast.
How much salt will tell you though?

57
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.250
This is probably an answer,
how much salt will kill you.
Cause uh,

58
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.450
I heard a doctor say that it was fascinating because he was talking about,

59
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.480
um,
and there's also,
there was a,
there was a really interesting lecture,
um,

60
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.221
and one of those,

61
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:46.240
a Terence Mckenna lectures where he's talking about LD 50 rates and it was

62
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:49.870
talking about things that will kill you.
And he's like,
there's a lot.

63
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.010
It's interesting.
Like there's a lot of shit that'll kill you here.
I believe it.

64
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.720
Believe it.

65
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.720
So the EGLN power food and the Himalayan salt is really what we think is the

66
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:04.390
best way to get these nutrients.
The Himalayan salt has the 84 minerals,

67
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.540
the vegetables and the fruits and the things in the EGM power,

68
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:11.740
food have more minerals and also the Fido nutrients and vitamins in there.

69
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.170
Plus we got an eight strain probiotic in there.

70
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.880
It's really the kind of cover your ass powder you can have.

71
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:21.520
If you're not going out and eating a bunch of great vegetables,

72
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.060
this has got your bases covered.
It's so important to do that.

73
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:26.080
If you don't do that,

74
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:30.490
you're robbing yourself of the little just extra burst of energy and life for

75
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:33.310
sure.
When I eat like a lot of fresh vegetables,

76
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:38.200
when I make like Kale shakes and and,
and make sure that my diet is clean,

77
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.710
I feel bad or my fucking brain works better,
my body works better.

78
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:43.280
I feel better like this.

79
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.570
There's a dull feeling when you eat and cheeseburgers and fries and you're not

80
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:50.620
getting any real food,
there's a dull feeling to life.
Your body's like,
Oh,

81
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:53.500
this Dick,
look what he pumped in here.
Look what he pumped in here.

82
00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.120
We can't use it.
Oh,
it's just fart.

83
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:58.720
And just fucking try to figure our way through this slop,
this shithead just,

84
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.760
we've got a problem with the pleasure drive.

85
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.660
The pleasure drive is so fucking addicted to pleasure constantly.

86
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:07.150
It can't even take a couple of minutes,
have a Kale shake.

87
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.740
It's like it's just now.

88
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.570
If you just think of it as mouth pleasure,
you know,

89
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.490
just a little bit of mouth pleasure on your tongue and what the lengths people

90
00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:19.180
will do,

91
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.160
what sacrifices they will make to continue this little tiny minuscule mouth

92
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:28.420
pleasure game.
They'll sacrifice it all.
Goddamn fucking bread.

93
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.650
White bread jam and peanut butter.

94
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:34.090
That's half sugar.

95
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.200
I just wanted that spike right into my fucking liver.

96
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.550
I want to feel it.
I want to feel my,
my blood start to just cough.

97
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:47.770
I want to feel,

98
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:52.771
I want to feel what it's like when you eat a giant bowl of sugar food cereal,

99
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.580
like one of those captain crunch or cocoa puffs.
He ever do that.

100
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.220
You ever get and eat like a salad

101
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.240
<v 1>bowl when you were a kid?</v>

102
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.330
When I was a for fruitless and it turns the milk all orange and red.

103
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.890
I think that's cool.
Oh yeah.
Look,
I got red milk now.
Well,
that's great for you.

104
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.160
I was very young growing lad.
Yeah.

105
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.520
Chocolate milk built into your cereal.
What you lazy?
Fuck,

106
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:19.180
you can't even add your own chocolate milk.
No,
no,
no.

107
00:06:19.181 --> 00:06:21.930
I want my milk to turn this into chocolate milk.

108
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.030
What a fucking a tipoff.
Maybe just eating sugar,

109
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.740
eating the wrong milk turned into chocolate milk.
Speaking of cereal,

110
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.260
I was having a talk with Chris Ryan yesterday and you guys might've covered it,

111
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:38.261
but that Guy Kellogg developed the corn flakes cereal and Graham crackers

112
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.320
because he thought it was so bland that it would stop,

113
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.220
help stop men from masturbating because it,

114
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:50.240
because the spicy or richer foods would incite the senses,

115
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.650
make them go crazy.

116
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.430
This crazy fucking Kellogg was developing these cornflakes and this was in his

117
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:57.040
book,
cornflakes and Graham crackers.

118
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.060
Really Bland foods to keep him from getting too excited and that's what a great

119
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:04.220
fact,
just,

120
00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:07.850
it's just so fun when you find out that people who created awesome things like

121
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:10.040
that were just crazy.
Meanwhile,
he didn't have,

122
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.430
he didn't have any girlfriend or he didn't have sex with,

123
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:15.260
while he was very proud not to have sex with his wife,

124
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.540
but he got a colonic from a very attractive young men every morning.
Oh,

125
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:23.180
did the guy uses dickers Waterhouse head or no,
I don't know.

126
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:27.000
It's all speculation from there you go rogue and off going on.
Of course,
man,

127
00:07:27.001 --> 00:07:30.170
it just totally makes sense.
People are so silly,
you know?

128
00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:33.670
And all we have to do is just get that cereal out there,
that cereal.

129
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.760
It becomes like something that we eat and then we just accept it.
Yeah.

130
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:37.850
And then everybody eats at cereal.

131
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.870
Just has to figure out a way to get into the hat.

132
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.240
I think it stopped zero people from masturbating that ultimately Kellogg fail.

133
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.200
I bet it didn't stop him.
No.
And that's what he really wanted.
You know,

134
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.440
he really wanted to stop himself from doing it.
Poor Fella.

135
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.760
But I think there's a lot of guys that are gay that are very ashamed of being

136
00:07:56.931 --> 00:08:00.360
gay.
So much that they hate sexuality.
It becomes a like a,

137
00:08:00.361 --> 00:08:04.670
a poison to them or an intoxicant that they can't resist,

138
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:08.040
it fucks them up,
you know,
because they don't wanna they don't wanna you know,

139
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.330
they don't want to beat a gang guy.
That topic is painful.
Yeah.

140
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.080
That old repress those feelings.
What's,
you know,
being a gay guy,

141
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:20.081
it's like you subject yourself to so much fucking ridicule and prejudice and it

142
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:25.280
just cruelty for no reason other than your sexual choices.
Just,

143
00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:28.100
it's a one of the weirdest things that we accept.
Yeah.

144
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.880
Well fortunately it looks like the Trans getting better.
I think so.
Right?
Yeah.

145
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.850
Do you think it's the internet,
like people being able to communicate?

146
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.890
I think it's a general,

147
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.030
a general and improvement in these kind of awareness about these things.

148
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.620
I think we need to hear it.
I think we get the word out.
We need to hear it.

149
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:46.830
We learned from each other and you know,

150
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.520
we're all like a bunch of who's in a fucking doctor Seuss movie.
You know,

151
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.990
we're trying to figure out how the Grinch took all of our toys and get together

152
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:56.100
in the middle of the middle of this village and just sing

153
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.780
<v 0>it out and what we'll work through this,
no doubt,
but human beings,</v>

154
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:01.560
man,

155
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.450
we're one of the strangest thing that's ever existed and there's a few things we

156
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:09.180
know about each other and one of the things you know about each other's that we

157
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:11.040
can learn.
We can teach each other.

158
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.550
I don't know what the fuck is going on and you don't either.

159
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:16.440
There's too many things going on.

160
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.950
There's 7 billion people on a rock that's spinning around in a circle.

161
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.850
There's no way anybody has a handle on what the fuck is going on in this world.

162
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:29.550
It's impossible.
You can't,
you can't be aware of everything.

163
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.050
You can't be aware of IOWASCA and subatomic particles and mathematical

164
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:39.080
algorithms and chess moves and Jujitsu and had a fucking skateboard and how to

165
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:44.931
fly a plane and how to fix a broken brain and how to do open heart surgery and

166
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:49.890
how to repair a roof.
There's too much shit.
We need each other.

167
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.130
The only way we can rock this thing is if we,
we help each other out.

168
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.160
That's what we,
we have to figure out that all this,

169
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.540
whether it's sexism or racism or homophobia,

170
00:10:00.541 --> 00:10:03.200
all that stuff is just,
it's,
it's,

171
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:06.660
you're fucking up the potential.
That's what you're doing.

172
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.230
Human beings have the potential to realize,
oh,

173
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.690
the only thing that's important is how we treat each other.

174
00:10:12.691 --> 00:10:15.510
That's the only thing that's important.
All these other things.

175
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:16.560
We've just culture,

176
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.160
all these other things that just behavior patterns we've grown to expect of each

177
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.560
other.
But what do we really appreciate it?
What do we really need?

178
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.670
We need to be nice to each other.
That's it.
And once you figured that out,

179
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.450
everything else becomes like,
Duh.
Yeah.

180
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:34.830
Don't give a guy 10 ounces of salt to see if that'll kill them.
Okay.

181
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.260
It's simple.
And don't give it to a monkey.
You don't give it to a monkey either.

182
00:10:38.261 --> 00:10:42.570
Yeah.
Don't test your lipstick out on fucking rabbits.
Stop that.
Just weird.

183
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.600
Unnecessary.
I don't know if it is,
I mean,
it might have saved some people.

184
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.930
That's the problem.
Nick Depaulo had a great,
but a bit about that.

185
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.440
I don't want to fuck his bit up,
but the paraphrase it,
it was something like,

186
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.430
so if you're telling me,
you know nick deposits like really strong Boston accent,

187
00:10:56.431 --> 00:10:57.090
they'll fuck up.

188
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:02.090
You're telling me that they're going to slap a car battery charger to a monkey's

189
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:06.060
head and a,
they're going to figure out how to cure cancer.
Yeah.
Well,

190
00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:09.940
fucking this is what I have to say.
The black is positive.
The red,

191
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.830
the red is degraff.
I fucked it up state.
It's the red block breads positive.

192
00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:17.040
The black is negative.
Red.
Red is positive.

193
00:11:17.041 --> 00:11:21.630
The black is a ground fire.
If it's going to save my dad hooked that monkey up.

194
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.460
Come on.
I'm on team people,
but it has,
it's a rude way to do it.
Yeah.

195
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.900
It's a rude way to cut corners and indeed be,

196
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.090
especially with these low probability options where we're like,

197
00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:36.270
I don't give a fuck.
We have to keep the people alive.
We have to figure it out.

198
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.300
We did some silly stuff to people too.
I mean,
Oh hell yeah.

199
00:11:39.301 --> 00:11:41.760
I started looking into lobotomies alone.

200
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.720
Just sticking an ice pick in the corner of your eye and just thrashing it
around.

201
00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:49.560
There wasn't even like a prescribed pattern for doing this slide,

202
00:11:49.561 --> 00:11:54.400
an ice pick in the corner eye and just wiggle it around till that was sufficient

203
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:57.700
enough.
And what kind of fucking sedatives with these people on while they were

204
00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:01.750
scrambling their brain with a nice pair,
strong hips,
I dunno.

205
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.340
I mean they had to be pretty,

206
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.390
pretty zonked out and that's to drill holes in people's brains to relieve

207
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:09.990
pressure
her or that,

208
00:12:09.991 --> 00:12:12.670
let's just call it a truck and trap panning or something like that,

209
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:17.170
I believe is the term.
I think that's science.
Yeah.

210
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.250
So it's taken a long time for people.
Did you get,

211
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.300
just to get this retarded as retired as we are now,
but I think,

212
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.800
I think we have a better shot than any other generation that's ever come before

213
00:12:29.801 --> 00:12:33.130
us.
Absolutely.
It's just the truth is available at a,

214
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.980
at a dose that has never been seen before.
Yeah.

215
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:41.010
Right now we have the opportunity at the very least to go seek sources outside

216
00:12:41.291 --> 00:12:43.600
mainstream media filled with propaganda.

217
00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:47.420
We can go talk to people who've been there,
access them,
see their streams,

218
00:12:47.421 --> 00:12:51.910
see their Facebook pages,
you know the,
the ability to find truth is there.

219
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.160
Now we'll just have to get a compass,
you know,

220
00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:57.340
and that's the next survival skills.
Getting the fucking truth compass.

221
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:02.550
When you see a political speech or when you see a local TV broadcast of the

222
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:06.660
news,
you,

223
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.700
what you're looking at is like the echoes of a crazy past where things were fake

224
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.040
and they were supposed to stay fake and they promoted him as,
as being,

225
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.390
this is the news and the guys were wearing makeup and he's got some strange suit

226
00:13:22.391 --> 00:13:24.640
and people keep coming odor when touching his hair,

227
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.700
making sure everything's okay.
When they say cut and they go to commercial,

228
00:13:27.701 --> 00:13:30.470
someone rushes over to him and starts blowing powder on him.

229
00:13:30.471 --> 00:13:31.360
It's training them up.

230
00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:35.890
Just nice like what the fuck are we doing here?

231
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.220
Are you guys actually tell him the news or are you putting on a show?

232
00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:42.880
Why you trying to make them look pretty?
Why you fucking with his hair?

233
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.150
Like is that a man talking?
Like what?
What is going on?

234
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.640
We pretending his hair has never had a place.

235
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.420
Are we pretending that you know his,
his face looks that actual color.

236
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.200
Like what are we doing here?
What are we doing?
Those don't work anymore.

237
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.700
They don't work because of this.

238
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.470
They didn't work because the conversations like this,

239
00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:02.500
they don't work because of someone's blog.
They don't work because of Twitter.

240
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:04.660
They don't work because of Facebook.
They don't work cause a youtube,

241
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.620
you could see someone,
you could see anything.
You can see like literally,
yeah,

242
00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:11.830
we're behind the curtains of the fucking odds show right now.
Exactly.

243
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.740
The idea that they're going to censor things on television.
Guess what?

244
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.840
The same people who watch television go on the Internet.
It's the same guy,
Dan.

245
00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:23.920
People.
You're protecting people.
Reality.
You're not going to stop it.

246
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:28.030
What you're going to do by pretending that that the world is different as you're

247
00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:30.700
gonna allow this thing to swarm up behind you.

248
00:14:30.701 --> 00:14:35.500
This was this thing called the internet and just going to swarm around and then

249
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:37.730
it's going to be like,
why do you have a TV?
Yeah.

250
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:41.560
Like what are you going to do with that thing if it wasn't for like Hbo or the

251
00:14:41.561 --> 00:14:43.030
people make walking dead things,

252
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:46.480
things that you're never gonna make it and live sports and live sports.

253
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.580
That's a big one.
Don't figure out how to do that.

254
00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:52.250
Some crazy fucking billionaire character will come along and figure out how to

255
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:55.570
put a some kind of a football game on the internet that gets streamed into and

256
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.720
what we're going to have TVs that are easily accessible,
like to things.

257
00:14:59.721 --> 00:15:02.870
The way your,
your computer is,
the way you could get.
That's not,

258
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.780
that's not around the corner.
That's like right here,
Mike.

259
00:15:04.781 --> 00:15:06.890
My TV has a Netflix thing built into it.

260
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.130
You go to Netflix right from your TV and knows how to get top.
Yeah.

261
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:15.290
I mean this is going to be what everybody has someday in the future.
A decade,

262
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:18.990
two decades.
It's going to be way more advanced.
It's going to happen sooner.

263
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.030
Probably sooner.
You can't.
You can't be selling people that bullshit.
No doubt.

264
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.780
Should we play the music here?
Indeed.
Oh,

265
00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:29.900
on a.com this is the longest Onnit commercial.
Our,

266
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.490
oh and it had nothing to do with like to,
uh,

267
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.580
I'll get some people who'll be telling me,
man,

268
00:15:34.581 --> 00:15:38.480
you had a 30 minute on a commercial.
Didn't they just needed to deal with that?

269
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.120
People always have this.
See,
that's a perfect example.

270
00:15:41.121 --> 00:15:43.370
They have this way that they want it done.
Come on,
man.

271
00:15:43.371 --> 00:15:45.560
We're talking about interesting shit.
Stop lying.

272
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.620
He'll get yourself a Zombie kettle bell and prepared for the apocalypse.

273
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.850
If you haven't seen them.
They're all at [inaudible] Dot Com o.
N.
N.
I.
T.

274
00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:56.120
We actually had a,
an artist Stephen Shubin Junior,
right?

275
00:15:56.121 --> 00:16:00.380
That's his name and he made the fucking dopest kettlebells,

276
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.650
the human race's ever seen for sure.
The primal bells,

277
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:07.250
which are these fucking awesome eight faces.

278
00:16:07.251 --> 00:16:10.910
There's a gorilla that looks like he wants to steal your fucking soul.

279
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.220
Does it chip Pansy?
It looks like he wants a bite.

280
00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:17.690
Your Dick off is a rang Tang who's going to beat you to death with his nut sack

281
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.490
and there's a howler monkey.

282
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.320
The howler monkey is going to try to steal your dick away from the champ.

283
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.610
That's how I would describe it.
I like it,

284
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.560
but they're awesome and they're also balanced.

285
00:16:30.561 --> 00:16:34.790
One of the cool things about these is that you can use them for training and

286
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.900
they don't,
they don't fuck up.
Like you could make something that looks cool,

287
00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:41.840
but if it wasn't balanced,
it wasn't as functional as a kettle bell,

288
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:43.820
it would kind of defeat the purpose of having them.

289
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.790
So they're functional artwork,
they look awesome as fuck,

290
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:50.960
but they're very functional for exercise and there may not a solid battle.

291
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.220
All right?
They're not going anywhere.

292
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.460
Like you could have these things for a hundred fucking thousand years.

293
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.110
They could find these and some,

294
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.570
some future civilization will think that you worship the gorilla with a halo and

295
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.170
build them into your will.
Yeah.

296
00:17:03.171 --> 00:17:07.670
There'll be some Graham Hancock style character in the future.

297
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.640
We try to break down the 2013 civilization.

298
00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:12.320
It'll still be one of the grand puzzles.
Yeah,

299
00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:15.920
it'd be like all the shit started to hit the fan and people started worshiping

300
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:17.460
apes cause I,

301
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:21.450
it's appears that was a call back to the primal nature of man.

302
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.780
They made these handles to carry them easier.
Go get some.

303
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.050
They're guaranteed to make your dick hard.
That's on a.com.

304
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.580
O n n I t Holla RB.
Microsoft's here Cuban music.

305
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.300
<v 2>Well,
good experience Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

306
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.370
So I got this dolphin friend and he's like,
hey man,

307
00:17:47.371 --> 00:17:50.040
you want to try some puffer fish?
Dude,
you

308
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.240
<v 0>never done a puffer fish.
Come on man.
Don't be scared of fish dog.</v>

309
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.100
We are telling you this.

310
00:17:56.101 --> 00:17:59.850
She this December 31st is there was an article that was just released this week

311
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.240
that showed that dolphins pass around puffer fish and get high from their toxins

312
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:10.440
and this is the first time we've ever observed an animal like as intelligent as

313
00:18:10.441 --> 00:18:13.050
a dolphin that goes out of its way to get high.

314
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.860
We've seen animals like bears will like drink for mental barriers,
animals,

315
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.660
Jaguars.
We saw the Jaguars.
Yeah,
that's a crazy worker.
Great.
That one up dude.

316
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.550
Okay.
This is a video of a Jaguar eats DMT.

317
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.800
It is literally one of the coolest videos on the Internet.

318
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.850
This is Jaguar that gives zero fucks.

319
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:37.510
When you're a Jaguar,
you don't have to give up the fuck.
He eats alligators.
Okay?

320
00:18:37.511 --> 00:18:40.950
He kills those Kamins as a crocodile.
He bites them in the head and eat some.

321
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.770
You've seen that to write on a regular basis?
They do that.

322
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:47.580
It's part of their diet.
They eat fucking crocodiles so he's not scared of Shit.

323
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:53.100
So when he does his drugs,
he's so peaceful,
you know,

324
00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:56.190
because he is literally the Tibitty tipity top of the food chain.

325
00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:01.380
So this Jaguar has this plant that he eats and a copy vine I believe.

326
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.450
Yeah,
play the sound so we can hear it.

327
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:09.160
So cool if you haven't seen it because it's Jaguars.
Justin is pet cats majestic

328
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.360
<v 3>and watch cats like Jackie lead when regurgitated they cleanse the digestive</v>

329
00:19:15.301 --> 00:19:16.134
system.

330
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.990
<v 2>Sounds like I'll ask a trip.</v>

331
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:26.960
<v 3>It's so bad ass looking</v>

332
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.590
some plants in juice on that effect.

333
00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.640
<v 2>Oh my God.
He's tripping his balls off.</v>

334
00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:38.720
Why it being so politically correct in this description in this video,

335
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.680
some plants produce a communist rainforest vines.
Whoa.

336
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.470
It seems to Cole's playful kitchen.
His behavior

337
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.850
could something deeper be happening.
Of course it is.
Bitch.

338
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:51.703
What are you talking about?

339
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.740
You had a god damn killer animal that stared off into space.
Light on its back.

340
00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.880
That thing is fucked up.
I might not know that much about cats,

341
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:04.710
but I know a lot about people being fucked up.
I know they take,

342
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.880
I recognize that look,
gain.
The janky was this thing is tripping.

343
00:20:08.881 --> 00:20:12.720
It's balls off man.
Look at its dilated eyes staring at the sun.

344
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.780
What the fuck are you saying?
That cat is high as fuck.
Look at it.

345
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.800
Kidding with the souls of all the animals Archie to heighten eight sensors we

346
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.003
need.

347
00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.540
<v 0>That is so wild,
man.</v>

348
00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.203
<v 4>Okay.</v>

349
00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:32.130
<v 0>[inaudible] world is so fucking fascinating.</v>

350
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.470
You know I was talking to Roseanne about this yesterday.

351
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.610
Roseanne Barr was here and she's uh,
you know,

352
00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.760
she loves nature's big advocate of nature.

353
00:20:39.761 --> 00:20:43.930
And we were talking about the idea that people just came into the Amazon and

354
00:20:43.931 --> 00:20:47.020
just gang these folks out of their land.
Like just,

355
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.330
they don't have paper money that looks the same as our money.

356
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.570
Just cause we as society,
all that place that you've been living at for new,

357
00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:54.880
you don't own that now.
That's the rain forest.

358
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:59.170
Now you can own real estate in Idaho,
but you don't own the rain forest.

359
00:20:59.171 --> 00:21:01.480
Like here's a farmer in Idaho has been there for,

360
00:21:01.481 --> 00:21:03.880
fuck my family came here and 17,
20,

361
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:07.470
that what did that guy do that's any different than these people that will,

362
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.550
oh you just decided that that guy gets that link.

363
00:21:09.551 --> 00:21:12.160
Cause he got there first back then when it was written,

364
00:21:12.161 --> 00:21:14.470
not a certain piece of paper.
Is that what you're saying?

365
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.470
You're stealing from these fucking people.
They're living in the jungle.

366
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:22.240
You're robbing them.
I mean it might as well be a mass invasion of uh,
uh,

367
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.080
a murderous army from space.
You know,
you're totally cheating.

368
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.900
You have all sorts of shit.
They don't have like trucks,

369
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.460
chainsaws and machine guns.

370
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.250
You're just jacking their shit and they're giving it to you because they're

371
00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:36.360
scared as fuck.
They don't really want to work for the factory.
Yeah.

372
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.510
They don't have a choice.

373
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.650
<v 5>And you know,
when you do give these people a choice,
they always go back to,</v>

374
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.920
you know,

375
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.810
let's say I was actually a story I had from a slightly different topic from the

376
00:21:46.811 --> 00:21:47.231
animals,

377
00:21:47.231 --> 00:21:50.500
but I did an interview with Jimmy Nelson who did that book before they pass away

378
00:21:50.501 --> 00:21:52.690
when out with the tribes and they,
uh,

379
00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:56.350
the actually the Russian government gave the Siberian tribe the [inaudible].

380
00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.730
They gave him opportunity to move into some housing basically where they would

381
00:22:00.731 --> 00:22:02.830
have food and television and vodka.

382
00:22:02.831 --> 00:22:06.430
And these people live out in the frozen Siberia and steps like one of the

383
00:22:06.431 --> 00:22:09.190
hardest lives possibly imaginable.

384
00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.460
So they go move into these buildings are like,
oh fuck it.
We'll try it.

385
00:22:12.461 --> 00:22:14.470
Look at all the free time we'll have it.
It's warm and shit.

386
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:19.150
So they tried it and you know,
started drinking and then within a couple months,

387
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.100
one,
you know,
one night in the middle of the night,

388
00:22:21.101 --> 00:22:24.510
they just all packed up the whole tribe and then move back out to the step.
Well,

389
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.220
you know,
because it's just,
it's a better life.

390
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.840
<v 0>We can't imagine that because if we're so fucking silly,</v>

391
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.270
if you have more Zeros,
you win.

392
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.390
If you have more Zeros at the end of your game,
you're when you're,
you,

393
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:44.460
if you make $100,000 and another man makes $100 million,

394
00:22:44.951 --> 00:22:47.740
you owe is go,
damn.
That guy wins.
You know what I mean?

395
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:52.680
Even if the guy is just fucking miserable and popping pills,
he's still,
you have,

396
00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:57.550
and motherfuckers got $100 million.
Like if I had that money,

397
00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:02.410
fuck dude,
I never be depressed.
My troubles would all go away.
Yeah.

398
00:23:02.411 --> 00:23:05.050
So backwards.
So listen,
it's not actually

399
00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.260
<v 5>putting in the moment.</v>

400
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:10.160
The people with all this money generally are no happier than anybody else.

401
00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.040
<v 0>And people don't want to admit this either.</v>

402
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:14.560
This is one that people do not want to admit.
They go,
yeah,
well,

403
00:23:14.561 --> 00:23:17.380
I don't see it that way,
man.
I think that,
you know,

404
00:23:17.381 --> 00:23:20.430
money's not even really that important man.
You know?
Um,

405
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.770
my happiness is not measured and bitch,
shut up.
You know,

406
00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:28.030
that guy's got $100 billion.
If he's got $100 billion,
that makes you freak.

407
00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:31.120
That makes you freak out.
Have you ever seen Bill Gates' house?
Oh,

408
00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:35.140
you don't want one of those?
Shut the fuck up.
You don't want that thing,
Joe.

409
00:23:35.141 --> 00:23:39.700
He's got us submarine.
Okay.
He's kind of like an escape pod in his house.

410
00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.180
His house knows who he is when he goes into every room.
Oh,
you don't want that?

411
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.040
Well,
you'd rather live in fucking hunting squirrels with a BB gun out in

412
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.850
<v 1>the woods.
That's what you'd rather do.
Make fires with rocks.
Shut the fuck up.</v>

413
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.840
Shut the fuck up.
You don't want that house.
That guy's got $100 billion.

414
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.260
It's not even a little bit fascinating to you that he has museums.

415
00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:00.860
That's not fascinating to,
you know.
No big deal.
Just museums.

416
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.780
He sets up habitats for people.
He provides scholarships for people.

417
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.640
Pumps billions of dollars into the economy.
No,

418
00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:12.100
it's not my interested in that man.
She know just like being out here in nature.

419
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:16.730
Okay,
shut up.
He probably liked Paul.
Okay,
got it.

420
00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:20.060
They're kind of crazy,
right?
Both of crazy.
You got to have the balance.

421
00:24:20.061 --> 00:24:22.940
He can't be that.
That guy that only cares about money.
I knew,

422
00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:27.680
I knew a billionaire would wash like disposable cups in the Dishwasher,

423
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.820
wash disposable cups in the dishwasher because that was part of the game that

424
00:24:31.821 --> 00:24:35.810
was saving him more money and keeping his pot,
you know,
bigger.
You know?

425
00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.550
And so that's,
that's that one extreme.

426
00:24:37.551 --> 00:24:39.560
And then there's the other extreme where he said,
oh,

427
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:42.690
it completely doesn't matter.
I don't care.
Capitalism,
socks,

428
00:24:42.691 --> 00:24:46.220
everything is terrible.
There's a middle way,
there is a middle.

429
00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:50.240
There's that middle truth of appreciating the abundance that you have of life

430
00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:53.660
and friends and love and happiness and all of these things that are really

431
00:24:53.661 --> 00:24:56.630
meaningful.
And then also going out and you know,

432
00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:01.250
achieving something that you can have these luxuries and experience more

433
00:25:01.251 --> 00:25:03.980
vacation,
more travel,
see different parts of the world.

434
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:08.600
Take people there with you,
give to people who need it.
You know that you can,

435
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.400
when you have it,
you know,
I mean there's,

436
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.880
there's value in both and people try to be one or the other.
Exactly.

437
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:18.530
And that's where they lose the truth.
They lose the truth in their ideology.

438
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.680
You know what's bad is shitty behavior,

439
00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.710
but if we're going to agree that something is worth something,

440
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:26.090
if we're going to agree that,
you know,

441
00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:29.630
my two hours of time is worth $40 you know,

442
00:25:29.631 --> 00:25:31.550
if I'm going to work for you for $20 an hour,
we're gonna.

443
00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:32.413
We're gonna agree to that.

444
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:36.470
It's because I can get something out of that $20 that I'm not going to get any

445
00:25:36.471 --> 00:25:37.480
other way.
Sure.
That,
you know,

446
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.610
that's the only way I'm going to get a fucking a thing of pineapple juice.

447
00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.070
I'm not going to,
I'm not growing my own pineapples.

448
00:25:43.071 --> 00:25:45.620
I'm not going to go to Hawaii and bring them back.
You know,

449
00:25:45.621 --> 00:25:48.920
if I want pineapple juice,
I have to give some money,
right?
So I'll be willing to,

450
00:25:48.921 --> 00:25:52.010
I'll climb your poll for fucking two hours and you give me some pineapple juice.

451
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:56.660
You know,
if we're not gonna agree to that,
then we're not cooperating.
So if you,

452
00:25:56.661 --> 00:26:00.980
if you're like a person who does it,
I ended up leaving many man,
that's,

453
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.670
well then it's too complicated.
Okay,
so how do I know what's worth what?

454
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:06.230
Now it's just super inefficient.

455
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:09.680
Let's say you have goats and you want pineapples.
Well,

456
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:12.170
what if the person who has pineapples doesn't like,
oh,
it's all right.

457
00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:15.350
Well then you have to find what the person who has the pineapples,
what he wants.

458
00:26:15.351 --> 00:26:16.700
Exactly.
Trade with that person.

459
00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:19.100
But what if that person doesn't want goats either?
So then you gotta go.

460
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:23.650
You gotta make these convoluted for ways,
systems when you don't have,
you know,

461
00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.350
we don't have a basis of currency.
I know,
but it makes sense.

462
00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:31.250
It's just so weird that we don't get to decide like how that currency's run.

463
00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:35.540
We don't have to decide like the idea that we don't get to,

464
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:38.360
we don't ever get to look behind the curtain at the Federal Bank.

465
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:40.700
It's just like off.
It's crazy.

466
00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:43.980
Little fucking castle somewhere with clouds around it.

467
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.980
<v 0>Lightening Bolts and nobody goes in there and explains why we owe $13 trillion.</v>

468
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.870
Like no,
but like,
what are you talking about?
We don't know you shit.

469
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:55.530
You better shut the fuck up.
We don't even know you and Nicole,
are you crazy?

470
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.510
Like if the whole world,
we're soldiers,

471
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:02.040
if the entire United States was armed soldiers and the bank was like,
Hey,

472
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:07.020
you know you guys owe us $13 trillion,
woo hoo.

473
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:10.390
I don't know you anything.
Look at me,
look at me.
Me.
No I don't.

474
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.050
I'm not responsible for those people that lived a hundred years ago would make

475
00:27:13.051 --> 00:27:15.900
those decisions.
This is what I owe you.
Zero.
Okay.

476
00:27:15.901 --> 00:27:20.070
And I comprise one of 300 million that's in the population.

477
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:24.000
So all of us collectively,
oh your zero cause we're all the same.

478
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:26.010
We don't have nothing to do with your fucking debt.

479
00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:27.810
Like what are you talking about?
Did you guys,

480
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:31.920
you did such a horrible job constructing your infrastructure and financing wars

481
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.850
that you,

482
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:37.850
you spent $13 trillion that no one has and you expect people to be responsible

483
00:27:38.221 --> 00:27:41.670
for that.
What?
What percentage of people make these choices?

484
00:27:41.671 --> 00:27:45.420
That causes us to be in $13 trillion?
Is it even one,

485
00:27:45.421 --> 00:27:48.390
100th of 1% of the people make those choices.

486
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:52.620
We should feed them to hyenas.
All of them.

487
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:54.930
Those savages that have put us in this fucking,

488
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:59.080
you want to talk about miss the old?
We're just trying to manage the economy.

489
00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:02.490
You missed it by 13 Raelian.

490
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.500
What are you just stealing money?
Tell me what you're doing.
How did you let it?

491
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:11.490
If you had a credit card,
you ran it up and they said,
Mr Marcus,

492
00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:15.060
you've passed your limited Citibank and we'd like to extend your limit.

493
00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.570
How much did they give you when?
When you're $100 million in the hole.

494
00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:20.940
And they're like,
well,
keep financing him.
I've got a good feeling about this app.

495
00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:24.600
Point of too big to fail Joe.
Okay.
Carry big feeling about this kid.

496
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.470
He owes us $1 trillion.
Ah,
he's looking at him.
He's a beautiful man.

497
00:28:28.471 --> 00:28:31.020
He's handsome.
He's not.
It's gonna work out for him.

498
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:34.800
He's got a good energy about them.
How do you get to that much money fucks?

499
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:39.540
We don't know you had goddamn nickel.
Not a nickel.
Not a penny.
This,
this Ma.

500
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:43.680
Thanks for fucking it up.
Go away now.
We'll take it from here.
No,

501
00:28:43.681 --> 00:28:48.300
you can't keep fucking us.
No,
no,
no.
You can't keep running the world like this.

502
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.080
Good thing that you know they're preventing all of that revenue they could get

503
00:28:52.081 --> 00:28:56.070
from legalizing marijuana coming in because that would help them to,

504
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.070
they need some pot too.
That's the real problem.
They all need it.

505
00:28:59.071 --> 00:29:01.590
They'd have more money.
It feel better about that.

506
00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:05.250
They probably should hang out with the jaguars though and eat some of the copy

507
00:29:05.251 --> 00:29:08.400
of vines.
That's too scared.
But you gotta take baby steps.
Start with little weed.

508
00:29:08.401 --> 00:29:11.760
Weed is a gateway with drug.
Excuse me.
Weed is the gateway drug.

509
00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.760
It's the gateway drug to psychedelics.
Yeah.

510
00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.560
It's a gateway drug to understand that you don't know shit.
It's good.

511
00:29:16.561 --> 00:29:21.060
It's good for you.
Good for everybody.
It's good for me.
I like it.
I enjoy it.

512
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:25.680
I benefit.
We live in a dream.
Aubrey.

513
00:29:25.681 --> 00:29:26.770
Marcus,

514
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:31.790
it makes no sense because the people before us fucked it up so hard that we're

515
00:29:32.851 --> 00:29:35.960
running on the momentum of these knucklehead decisions.

516
00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.440
These fucking dummies had made an embarrassing ones.
You're like,

517
00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.790
when native Americans call,
like,
you know,
we want packer Arlin and like,

518
00:29:42.791 --> 00:29:45.320
what are they talking about?
Oh,
you don't want to know,
but what,

519
00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:46.163
what are they talking about?

520
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:50.650
We read this and he started reading about what the fuck happened to native

521
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:55.300
Americans when the Europeans got here.
Like it's an unheard of genocide.

522
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.940
I mean it's one of the things that never gets discussed,

523
00:29:57.941 --> 00:30:00.010
but there were people here,

524
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.160
there weren't just a few if with thousands and thousands and thousands of people

525
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.990
who had lived the same way for hundreds and hundreds of years.

526
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:12.453
And we,

527
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:17.760
not me not you people that somehow another built this place way before we came

528
00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:23.100
along.
They,
they,
they fuck those people.
Oh yeah.
They came across in these,

529
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:26.100
she stole from him and fought with him and shot him.
And

530
00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.720
<v 5>the disregard for human human beings is,</v>

531
00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:34.620
has been so prevalent throughout history.
And even now there's,

532
00:30:34.621 --> 00:30:37.830
you can see this kind of disregard and all of these corporations and everything,

533
00:30:37.831 --> 00:30:42.030
they're covering up.
I've been surprised this year.
And looking back at 2013,

534
00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:45.840
how much it extends,
you know,
like even,
uh,
you know,

535
00:30:45.841 --> 00:30:47.310
we mentioned amber lines before,

536
00:30:47.311 --> 00:30:52.290
but then her expo say on CNN and then all of a sudden,
you know,
you realize,

537
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:55.500
oh,
I thought it was kind of like anchorman where they just kind of report stuff

538
00:30:55.501 --> 00:30:57.570
that would be interesting to people.

539
00:30:57.571 --> 00:31:01.230
But really actually they have other agendas in Bahrain is paying the

540
00:31:01.231 --> 00:31:04.590
dictatorship in Bahrain is paying them money to do,
you know,

541
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:08.160
hype stories for him.
And then you're like,
okay,
so that's way more corrupt.

542
00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.970
And then you see the blackfish documentary and you see how fucked up and corrupt

543
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.660
seaworld is changing stories about why these orchids are going off and killing

544
00:31:15.661 --> 00:31:16.680
people,
you know?

545
00:31:16.681 --> 00:31:21.681
And then you keep looking at these different areas and seeing how much is

546
00:31:22.321 --> 00:31:23.640
actually corrupt and fucked up.

547
00:31:23.641 --> 00:31:26.460
And then of course the Snowden thing with the NSA,

548
00:31:26.461 --> 00:31:30.750
I mean go on down the line and it's like one after the other.

549
00:31:30.751 --> 00:31:34.800
You can just count where that money's going to and what their response is going

550
00:31:34.801 --> 00:31:35.634
to be.

551
00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.840
<v 0>Gotta be careful be Marcus.</v>

552
00:31:37.841 --> 00:31:41.440
There's a problem with all this thinking and this thinking ignores Tamar.

553
00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:44.320
Read something.
There are terrorists out there,

554
00:31:44.321 --> 00:31:47.320
Robert Democracy hate us for our freedom.

555
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.550
You don't understand because you live a privileged life.

556
00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:56.760
That cushy life of a civilian protected by the soldiers out there fighting for

557
00:31:57.251 --> 00:32:01.600
freedom.
You don't understand.
I'll be Marcus.
I must have missed it.

558
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:06.310
I must've missed,
they got us wrapped up in some crazy shit.

559
00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.550
Could you imagine if your friend came to you and go,
listen dude,
uh,

560
00:32:09.551 --> 00:32:13.120
I know you're enjoying a good time here in southern California and you've got a

561
00:32:13.121 --> 00:32:15.100
pool in the backyard that you barbecue in,

562
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.430
but we're on a team and uh,

563
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.850
you and I on a team and I got some problems with some dudes and Africa.

564
00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:25.120
So we're going to do,
we're going to go there.
You get to live there.

565
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.020
I'm going to pay you about 100 bucks a week and a,

566
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:32.440
you just going to dodge bullets and shoot people you don't know.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay,

567
00:32:32.441 --> 00:32:36.340
here we go.
You'd be like,
what the fuck,
man,
I gotta move away from Chris.

568
00:32:36.341 --> 00:32:40.190
He's crazy y'all.
He's telling me I'm in,
we're going to war with people

569
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.460
<v 6>in Africa.
Okay,
I'm living in Cleveland.
I got to go to Africa.</v>

570
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.840
What is happening here,
Chris,
you crazy.
I'm not going with you man.
Dude,

571
00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:50.940
we were on a team and it's your civic duty.
I've got you.

572
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:54.800
You scribbled on a piece of paper and I've see I have a video of you scribbling

573
00:32:54.801 --> 00:32:55.990
on this piece of paper.
Dot.

574
00:32:55.991 --> 00:33:00.020
Agrees that I get to use you for six years.

575
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.120
<v 1>Hers.
That's what you know.
One of the things,</v>

576
00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.970
and one of the things I haven't been on since I read sex at Tom,

577
00:33:05.971 --> 00:33:09.540
but one of the things that really impressed upon me is that the organizational

578
00:33:09.541 --> 00:33:13.770
structures of the human beings,
what we're designed to do,
and most primates,

579
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.950
you know,
fall,
falls in line with what they called the Dunbar number,

580
00:33:16.951 --> 00:33:20.970
which is somewhere between 50 to 150 people.
And if you add it for you,

581
00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:25.470
maybe for you,
maybe I get about 500 in there.
Well,
if you had,

582
00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:28.770
if you have that many people and you're making decisions,
what's best for them.

583
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:33.060
You don't do this crazy shit,
you know,
you don't have these crazy thoughts.

584
00:33:33.061 --> 00:33:36.570
He say,
okay,
what's going to be best for this?
150 people?
Well,
these people are,

585
00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.190
they're going to go out and they're going to hear some money.

586
00:33:38.191 --> 00:33:39.290
These people are gonna,
you know,

587
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:42.630
take care of the dance lessons or whatever the fuck you want to do for the
tribe.

588
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:44.310
But it makes sense at that point.

589
00:33:44.311 --> 00:33:48.700
But then you get these large ass numbers and these manipulations and this

590
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.620
anonymity and things get really wonky.
Well,
anonymity is,

591
00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.310
it's one step on the way to know more anonymity.
Ever.

592
00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.660
Anonymity came along in a way where you can communicate with me what it was
like.

593
00:34:00.661 --> 00:34:04.080
It was like the first echoes of a new error when people started to be able to

594
00:34:04.081 --> 00:34:05.610
communicate with each other online.

595
00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:09.870
And like when you read like evil youtube comments or someone just stuck in a
tax,

596
00:34:09.871 --> 00:34:12.960
people on Twitter,
some girl said something on Twitter,

597
00:34:12.961 --> 00:34:14.400
I don't remember what it was,

598
00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:18.250
<v 6>but it was like,
she was like a teeny bopper girl.
And,
uh,</v>

599
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:22.840
this troll Internet troll,
I read the responses and it's like,

600
00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:27.130
I hope a demon each.
You're rotten cunt,
you whore.

601
00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.960
Oh,
a demon eats your rotten con you whore.
And I'm like,

602
00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:35.560
oh my gosh.
Like nobody knows who that guy is.

603
00:34:35.561 --> 00:34:39.280
It's Trixie seven oh five.
He's got a picture.
It's a Elica.
Oh,

604
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.370
it looks like a tricksy like a,
what are those things?
You know,
like a Pixie,

605
00:34:42.371 --> 00:34:45.220
like a fairy.
Like that's his avatar.
And he says,
oh,

606
00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:49.380
he or she says the most horrible,
vicious,
evil shit.
You know,

607
00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:52.930
I don't know what the,
the actual,
um,
you know,
making up the name.

608
00:34:52.931 --> 00:34:56.980
But my point is that it was completely anonymous,
like this,

609
00:34:56.981 --> 00:34:59.290
this horrible thing that you could say to someone.

610
00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:02.560
He could shoot it out to them and for the first time you can touch them.

611
00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.060
You know,
if they read their Twitter,

612
00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.330
you can make them think that you think a terrible thought about them.

613
00:35:07.331 --> 00:35:10.090
And that's a tricky thing,
man.
It's a tricky thing because like,

614
00:35:10.091 --> 00:35:11.760
what are you doing when you're doing that?
Like,

615
00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.140
do you understand what you're doing because you're doing it just as if you were

616
00:35:14.141 --> 00:35:16.870
doing it to their face.
And if you're doing it to their face,

617
00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:20.710
you'd be a piece of shit,
right?
Yeah.
Right.
So why are you doing it this way?

618
00:35:20.711 --> 00:35:22.240
Just being sneaky.
Just like

619
00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:26.210
<v 1>I'm going to be none.
If you had the accountability of a tribe,
you know,</v>

620
00:35:26.211 --> 00:35:29.210
and you had 150 people,
let's say 120 650 is the limit.

621
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:31.190
People who knew you intimately well.

622
00:35:31.191 --> 00:35:34.010
And there was that one person who kept saying that to people in the tribe.

623
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.070
People would be like,
shut the fuck up.
Get out of.
So we don't

624
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.330
<v 5>need your nonsense.
But now it's just,
there's none of that accountability.</v>

625
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.370
And the other problem too is that,
you know,

626
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:46.500
without that kind of tribal structure,

627
00:35:46.501 --> 00:35:50.270
you're fucking stuck with whatever parent you got.
And that's your goal.

628
00:35:50.271 --> 00:35:52.460
And that's your lot.
And that's your mentor.
You know,

629
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:55.080
that's who's showing you the way,
you know,

630
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:58.900
there's no way for you to kind of variance,
this is kind of whack.

631
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.570
Let me go over here and stay with these guys.

632
00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.570
<v 0>Yeah,
there's nowhere where you look at it and you go do,</v>

633
00:36:02.571 --> 00:36:06.350
oh my dad's kind of a Douche.
Yeah.
Wish I had a better dad.
Right?

634
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.190
People I've met that didn't like their dad,
they're like,
yeah,

635
00:36:09.191 --> 00:36:12.830
my dad's fucking Dick.
Wish I had my neighbor's dad and neighbor.

636
00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:16.420
Billy's dad took him fishing.
He's a great guy.
I never hit him.
Right?

637
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.300
Yeah.
You can't choose man or can you talk?

638
00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.370
Some people believe I'll be Marcus.

639
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:27.130
You've chosen every single thing that happens to you in this life in advance,

640
00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:31.210
all to benefit a certain thing that you need to see,

641
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:36.060
all to expose you to just the right amount of knowledge and the right dosages

642
00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:39.100
until one day at appeals apart,
the egg of the universe,

643
00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:44.320
and you get to look inside of the eternity of perfect existence and ultimate

644
00:36:44.321 --> 00:36:46.090
knowledge and truth.
Boom,

645
00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:48.040
and then that's what we're doing as we're going through life.

646
00:36:48.041 --> 00:36:49.090
We're going to call it a death.

647
00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:51.150
We're going to call it death while grandpa passed away.

648
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:52.750
Now grandpa got the fuck out of here.

649
00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.580
His body quit and then a big burst of psychedelic chemicals entered his brain

650
00:36:57.581 --> 00:37:02.020
and he stepped through a giant infinite kaleidoscope and met with the universal

651
00:37:02.021 --> 00:37:04.420
one.
GRANDPA's going to be okay.

652
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:08.810
<v 5>Yup.
Well,
the dream,
the dream ended for Grandpa because this is the dream.</v>

653
00:37:08.811 --> 00:37:13.520
And then you're going back to
that.
I hit be talking my book.

654
00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.290
That's what I'm saying.
I'll be Marcus.

655
00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:20.620
A lot of hippy talk from a guy who calls himself warrior poet and a fear factor

656
00:37:21.111 --> 00:37:25.280
host.
I'm not buying it.
I'm not buying all this hippie talk.
Yeah,

657
00:37:25.281 --> 00:37:27.410
I think that's the,
I was thinking about what it,

658
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.570
what it kind of is and if this is the dream.

659
00:37:29.571 --> 00:37:34.070
So the first step is to kind of wake up and realize that this,
this is the dream.

660
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:37.490
And then at a certain point you'd be like,
Oh fuck.
Well this is a dream.

661
00:37:37.491 --> 00:37:40.550
So maybe it'd be better to escape the dream.
And you start thinking,

662
00:37:40.551 --> 00:37:43.670
what's the point?
Well then the pitfall of that,
how you get over that,

663
00:37:43.671 --> 00:37:47.180
the next step is to just love the dream for what it is.
You know,
we're here,

664
00:37:47.181 --> 00:37:50.510
we get to experience life and everything that's in this,

665
00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:55.460
in this dimension that couldn't even be possible in an infinite dimension with

666
00:37:55.461 --> 00:37:58.550
infinite knowledge,
without skin to touch and you know,

667
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.900
taste buds to taste and you know,

668
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.580
sex organs to feel and everything that is unique about this.

669
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.860
So you've got to love the dream for what it is.

670
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:12.190
And then from there you got to realize that ultimately we're all in this dream

671
00:38:12.381 --> 00:38:15.680
together and it's all the kind of the same cocreated dream.

672
00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.460
And we have the ability to kind of manipulate that and improve the dream for

673
00:38:19.461 --> 00:38:21.770
other people or make the dream worse for other people.

674
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:26.180
We're all in this piece together and that's kind of what we're here to do,

675
00:38:26.181 --> 00:38:31.160
is to create,
not a nightmare for everybody,
but to create a cool fucking dream.

676
00:38:31.161 --> 00:38:35.150
So one day when the stream ends,
we can look back and say,
God,

677
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.390
that was a good dream.
You know,
let's do another one.

678
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:40.780
Let's go back to sleep again.
Let's see what happens the next time.
Well,

679
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:45.640
it's hard for people to grasp is that you don't know what's next.
It's hard.

680
00:38:45.641 --> 00:38:49.840
It's scary.
It freaks people out.
So they seek,
seek help,

681
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.460
<v 6>pills,
booze,</v>

682
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:56.290
bullshit and bad relationships and drama at work and all this nonsense you just

683
00:38:56.291 --> 00:39:01.210
filling up your stupid head with just to distract yourself from this ultimate

684
00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.800
fascinating existence that we find ourselves in where we,

685
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:07.720
we have no idea what's coming next.

686
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.540
We don't know what's going on right now anywhere except what's right in front of

687
00:39:10.541 --> 00:39:14.370
us.
And even then the wheels of perception,
they,
the they,

688
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:18.640
the ebb and flow depending on what chemicals even deuced into your body,

689
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:22.150
whether or not he smoked a joint or ate a mushroom or you know,

690
00:39:22.151 --> 00:39:23.530
there's a lot going on here.

691
00:39:23.531 --> 00:39:28.000
It's not just as simple as this flat consciousness that we all agree upon

692
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.590
because I'm not entirely sure that other people have the same experience that I

693
00:39:32.591 --> 00:39:37.591
do when I look at like some country music and I look at like some TV shows and I

694
00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:40.750
look at some,
I shouldn't even say country music,
a lot of pop music.

695
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.620
I actually probably like more country music now than even like hop music.

696
00:39:44.621 --> 00:39:48.190
We spent some good times in the country,
but I'm a big Dwight Yoakam fan.

697
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:52.240
I like my dog's named Johnny Cash.
I mean I,
I like some country music,

698
00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.420
but there's some really stupid shit out there.
Why is it,

699
00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:00.160
is it because they're dumber than me or they see in a different reality is

700
00:40:00.161 --> 00:40:04.060
reality.
Just like your nose.
Your nose is a nose.
My nose,
his nose.

701
00:40:04.061 --> 00:40:07.690
But if my nose was on your face,
I'd be like,
what did you do different?

702
00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.840
You did something different and if you put your nose on my face,
you'd be like,

703
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.200
do some going.
Your nose looks different or something.
It would be,

704
00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:18.190
we both have a notes.
It's very recognizable.
Neither one are distinct.
There's,

705
00:40:18.191 --> 00:40:21.940
there's nothing,
you know,
like w w we don't flatten boxers,
noses or anything.

706
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.020
They're both pretty normal.

707
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:26.950
But I know my nose and I know your nose and I know your nose isn't my nose.

708
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:31.120
How do I know the test?
Not like reality.
That reality.
Like what?

709
00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.410
What other people see?

710
00:40:32.411 --> 00:40:36.850
They're seeing it through a filter that makes things that suck come in at,

711
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:40.960
come out the bit a better shape they have.
It has a better smell to it.

712
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:43.390
Things that seems stupid to you to them.

713
00:40:43.391 --> 00:40:47.080
And I'll just fits right into this neuron and this,
this uh,
this,
uh,

714
00:40:47.081 --> 00:40:51.550
ability to interact with light accepts this shape better than that shape for

715
00:40:51.551 --> 00:40:54.070
some strange with orange has always been my favorite color.

716
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:56.890
Are you seeing the same color I am cause orange looks stupid.

717
00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.450
Have you like orange?
You want an orange car?
You fucking Weirdo.
You know,

718
00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:05.590
but you know what I mean?
It's like,
well why would you like orange?
Is it a,
is it,

719
00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:10.660
is it a taste thing or is it a taste thing and your world is different than

720
00:41:10.661 --> 00:41:11.170
mine?

721
00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:14.150
<v 5>I think what you're mentioning is really one of the key lessons that,</v>

722
00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:18.330
<v 6>but I'm mentioning his pot smoking nonsense.
Well I was just going to draw it</v>

723
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:21.920
<v 5>when I was on that.
When I did my,</v>

724
00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:26.360
my last Iowasca trip in Peru and I had the vision of the Eagle and that was the

725
00:41:26.361 --> 00:41:30.620
secret that he basically gave me is I'm flying along with this condor eagle.

726
00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:34.490
And the Eagle says to me,
you know,
you to know how to see better.

727
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.890
You see through everybody else's eyes and the message there was that everybody

728
00:41:39.891 --> 00:41:43.880
has their own perception.
And to really understand what you're going through,

729
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.590
what they're going through and seeing,

730
00:41:45.591 --> 00:41:49.400
you have to see what they see through their lens of perception.

731
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.310
And if you can do that,
you know,

732
00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.620
all a lot of this hate and a lot of this anger goes away.

733
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:57.080
What you feel instead can be maybe pity.

734
00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:01.340
Like I feel bad for this human look at the way the world appears to them.

735
00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:05.120
Look at the way you know that person is so quick to anger,

736
00:42:05.121 --> 00:42:07.370
so quick to hate when really,
you know,

737
00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:10.220
they could look at the same situation with love and feel happiness.

738
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:14.810
And so it shifts your,
your kind of opinion on things,
but no doubt about it.

739
00:42:14.811 --> 00:42:16.550
We look at things a different way.

740
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:20.110
And the recent studies on epigenetics will show that you know,

741
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:23.300
things you can change the way things appear,

742
00:42:23.301 --> 00:42:28.130
probably not only on a mental level but probably a genetic level based on your

743
00:42:28.131 --> 00:42:32.670
epigenetic manipulation of belief.
You know,
and,
and what you see and I,

744
00:42:32.671 --> 00:42:33.170
I think,

745
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:36.290
you know Bruce Lipton's doing a lot of good research in that and that's a really

746
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:38.750
exciting field.
But you know,

747
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.350
just because you have a certain lens of perception doesn't mean that that can't

748
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:44.360
change with your choices and with your belief.

749
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:47.210
<v 6>Yeah.
And that that change would help you.</v>

750
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:51.680
We wanna we want hang on to the way we are so badly because we don't want to

751
00:42:51.681 --> 00:42:54.580
admit that we were ever wrong.
If we'd met wherever wrong,

752
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.440
then we have this reevaluation of the value of self.

753
00:42:57.441 --> 00:43:01.190
Cause the value of self is very important.
And one of the important things,

754
00:43:01.191 --> 00:43:03.890
a lot of people I was at the right,
they want to be right.

755
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:07.790
Like a lot of times you get in an argument with someone and it a certain point

756
00:43:07.791 --> 00:43:10.460
in that you're like,
why are we even,
why am I upset about this?
Like,

757
00:43:10.461 --> 00:43:14.000
I have nothing to do with this lizard that lives in fucking the Komodo islands.

758
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.863
I have nothing to do with them.

759
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.140
But you're insisting that it lives all over the place.
And I'm telling you,

760
00:43:18.141 --> 00:43:21.590
it only lives there and it's fucking zoos.
And like,
why is this even,

761
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.700
why is this upsetting?
What is it about this?
What's really going on here?

762
00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:31.130
The people,
um,
we,
we developed patterns and attachments

763
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:36.110
<v 5>and attachments to your attached to the persona of the guy who's right about</v>

764
00:43:36.111 --> 00:43:40.130
random facts,
you know,
so when you're attached to that and it gets challenged,

765
00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:42.530
you identify with it,
that's part of you.

766
00:43:42.531 --> 00:43:45.230
So it's actually threatening a piece of view,

767
00:43:45.231 --> 00:43:48.040
which triggers the kind of fear mechanism.
Right.

768
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:52.090
<v 6>It's fascinating.
When you talk to someone in you,
I'm mean,
I,
uh,</v>

769
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.580
I would never say that I'm absolutely free of that.
Um,

770
00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:59.680
I'm not free of any human emotion or something,
but,
um,

771
00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:01.600
I'm pretty good at controlling that impulse.

772
00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:06.460
And I'm also pretty good at not being attached to ideas until I've like really

773
00:44:06.461 --> 00:44:10.480
extremely vetted them out and also vetted out the opposing idea.

774
00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:14.020
But I've had conversations with people where they'll say something and be like,

775
00:44:14.021 --> 00:44:16.840
I had a conversation with this kid where he was talking about a psychedelic

776
00:44:16.841 --> 00:44:20.350
mushrooms and he disagreed that he was like very adamant,
very smart kid,

777
00:44:20.351 --> 00:44:23.710
very young,
probably like maybe 20 and he was talking to me about how,
you know,

778
00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.250
I disagree with Terence,
we can a stone mushroom theory.
He goes,

779
00:44:27.251 --> 00:44:28.480
I think it's too simplistic.

780
00:44:28.481 --> 00:44:33.150
And it ignores the fact that there's many different strange things that are Uber

781
00:44:33.151 --> 00:44:35.520
complex all throughout the universe.
You know,
why?

782
00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:38.490
Why should we assume that human beings got this way because of one compound?

783
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:42.480
And I was like,
you're right.
The fuck do I know I don't know nothing about.

784
00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:45.790
And he was like,
he goes,
oh,
okay,
I can respect that.
I go,
yeah,
I mean,

785
00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.740
what did I do?
The research,
am I,
I dunno.
I,
I think it's a good idea.

786
00:44:49.741 --> 00:44:52.980
I think the idea is sound because I think that chimps,

787
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:58.590
obviously they think,
and mushrooms make me think in a completely unique way.

788
00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:00.600
And I think that if a chimp ate mushrooms,

789
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.310
it would probably affect the way he thinks.
I mean,

790
00:45:02.311 --> 00:45:03.740
it just seems to make sense to me.
Okay.

791
00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:05.870
<v 5>Doubt.
I mean,
we can see it.
I mean,
you look at,</v>

792
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:09.590
you look at the pictures of the dolphins who are just doing that fucking the

793
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:14.090
puffer fish toxin.
They're going to this surface and looking at their reflection,

794
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.660
you know,
at that,
at that point,
that has to be changing.

795
00:45:17.661 --> 00:45:22.310
Some of the usual usual pattern is probably find fish,
find fish,
let's find fish.

796
00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.170
Oh,
let's play,
let's fuck,
let's talk.
That's fine.
Fucking,

797
00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:30.260
and then all the sudden they stop all that and it quiet and they say,
wow,

798
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:33.890
look at me.
I'm a fucking dolphin.
And then,

799
00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:39.140
and then it's a different pathway that opens up and that's what happened in

800
00:45:39.641 --> 00:45:42.680
these monkeys to at a certain point or humanoids or whatever,

801
00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:45.080
what stage they were on.
At a certain point they're like,

802
00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:49.210
<v 6>Ooh,
yeah,
that's also why it's good to drink.
Yeah,</v>

803
00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:52.870
it's good he drank.
You know,
people don't want to,
he want you to say that.

804
00:45:52.871 --> 00:45:54.610
They don't want to hear that.
Let me ask you this.

805
00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:59.440
If it wasn't good to drink and alcohol's availables many places it is as it is,

806
00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:03.730
we would be insane.
Look how many places talk about the parable.

807
00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.820
He tells me there's no benefit in this.
This shit is okay.

808
00:46:06.821 --> 00:46:10.870
It's just killing people.
That's it.
That's it.
100%.
We'll kill certain people.

809
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:14.530
So to hammers,
I'm supposed to make them illegal.
So sort of cars.

810
00:46:14.531 --> 00:46:18.670
So we stopped driving.
Don't tell me that alcohol doesn't have some benefits.

811
00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:21.010
Okay it does.
Cause every time I drank I go,

812
00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:23.740
this is the last fucking time I'm doing this the next day.

813
00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:26.410
And you've got to still do it again.
This benefit,
it makes you,

814
00:46:26.411 --> 00:46:27.430
it makes things more fun.

815
00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.520
It puts you in a state that you probably wouldn't achieve if you weren't there.

816
00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:34.040
Cause you gotta be careful with it and a you shouldn't drink too much and is,

817
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:39.280
there's a fine line between having a good time and being fucked up and you don't

818
00:46:39.281 --> 00:46:41.440
want to cross that line.
You're having a good time is nice.

819
00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.450
Like having a good time,
have a couple of drinks,

820
00:46:43.451 --> 00:46:47.380
having a bunch of laughs and everything's sound in groovy the next day you're a

821
00:46:47.381 --> 00:46:51.760
little fucking out of it.
But smiling,
drink lots of water,
you're good.
But those,

822
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:54.490
those get wrecked in Miami nights.

823
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:57.000
<v 5>You know,
I can't die here.</v>

824
00:46:57.001 --> 00:47:01.320
You go to Mexico and do Tequila shots with some bandits.
Yeah.

825
00:47:01.321 --> 00:47:05.430
I think just doing it in a slightly more conscious ways.
I think the key,

826
00:47:05.431 --> 00:47:05.611
you know,

827
00:47:05.611 --> 00:47:08.760
I've certainly had some pretty aggressive party days in my life and I actually

828
00:47:08.761 --> 00:47:11.390
wrote a blog on it and it was party,
you know,

829
00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:14.580
basically saying party with awareness still going on,
you know,

830
00:47:14.581 --> 00:47:15.510
don't get to that point.

831
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:18.240
We would have to fucking restaurant yesterday and Santa Monica really cool.

832
00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:23.220
I was up at up at the top floor of the Huntley out in Santa Monica and it's 8:00

833
00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.260
PM and there's a girl in the ladies room.

834
00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:30.130
Whitney tells me who is just puking everywhere.
Just hammered

835
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.750
<v 0>and her for a girlfriend is like,
oh,</v>

836
00:47:31.751 --> 00:47:36.460
you got some drops on your shirts so I don't care.
Whoa.
8:00 PM on a Monday,

837
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.950
you know,
like don't take it to their,
you know,

838
00:47:38.951 --> 00:47:42.610
and what happens is they get these tasty drinks and it's like,

839
00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:47.530
just drink it like it's a drug and joy it just shake your liquor straight and

840
00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:50.830
take your beer or just drank one margarita.
You fucking pig

841
00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:57.250
down five of 'em dude.
All right,
that's fine.
Listen Buddy,
you know,

842
00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:00.040
what are you doing Mr?
Thrown up all over your shoes.

843
00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.830
How many Margaret did you drink?
How old are you?
What are you doing?

844
00:48:02.831 --> 00:48:05.800
You throw it up on your shoes.
If fucking 45 year old man,

845
00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:08.710
throw it up in your shoe.
You've got to get over that at certain point.

846
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:11.350
That's why the people who don't drink til super late,

847
00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:14.020
they're just kind of screwing themselves,
you know?
I mean,

848
00:48:14.021 --> 00:48:15.550
cause then at the point that they do,

849
00:48:15.551 --> 00:48:18.370
you're going to have to learn all that bullshit for yourself.

850
00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.260
What are you gonna do?
Are you going to go your whole life without booze?

851
00:48:20.261 --> 00:48:24.730
Congratulations.
Oh,
you didn't have as much fun.
Congratulations.

852
00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:29.740
It's so stupid.
But if you one of those people that can't,
I get it genetically.

853
00:48:29.741 --> 00:48:32.860
I know people for fact that cannot drink.

854
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:37.870
They just have that weird fucking thing in them.
They have a drink and then boom,

855
00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:42.490
the eyelid shut could junk.
They open up as a new person back there.
Yeah.

856
00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.400
That new person's like,
we got it in the new person.

857
00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:48.660
Just fucking take some luck.

858
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:53.590
Not Spill on any computers.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I flail my hands too much.

859
00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.570
I got to learn how to do podcasting without movement.

860
00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:59.200
This is only like the 18th time I've spilled coffee in this fucking place.

861
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:03.450
What do you think that is when there's that dramatic personality shift?
You know,

862
00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:07.840
cause probably alcoholism.
It's a disease.
I mean I a firmly,

863
00:49:07.841 --> 00:49:11.710
absolutely one when you know,
people say you know,
disease self control.

864
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:15.730
You can only say that.
You can only say that if you live that person's body,

865
00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.100
you cannot.
I've seen it.
I'm,
I'm a,

866
00:49:18.101 --> 00:49:23.101
I'm 100% sure that some people are out coal holics and that their family are

867
00:49:24.791 --> 00:49:25.630
alcoholics.

868
00:49:25.631 --> 00:49:30.280
And it mean it doesn't just go in these giant family waves because it's a

869
00:49:30.281 --> 00:49:32.800
tradition.
At least people can't drink.
Okay?

870
00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:35.740
They're not like some people can drink,
you can drink,
I can drink,

871
00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.640
but we know people who can't drink.
Okay.
And that shit is just what it is.

872
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:42.670
There's,
there's certain people,
you know,
they get a couple of drinks and I'm,

873
00:49:42.671 --> 00:49:45.200
I trying to have a conversation with some dude this weekend that I liked.

874
00:49:45.201 --> 00:49:47.080
He's a nice guy,
but he was fuck,

875
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:51.640
and he tried to come up to me and it was four o'clock in the afternoon.

876
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:56.290
And then I asked him if he's drunk and he says no.
And it's like,
bitch,

877
00:49:56.291 --> 00:50:01.150
you are fucked up.
How dare you?
You're so hammered.
You can't even talk.

878
00:50:01.151 --> 00:50:02.380
And you're telling me you're not drunk.

879
00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:05.860
It's like when you call somebody and you say,
are you awake?
They always say,
yes.

880
00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.490
Are you drunk?
No,
not true.

881
00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:13.730
The booze is talking to you.
Go into it.
If you tell him you drunk,

882
00:50:13.731 --> 00:50:16.330
he's going to tell you can't have anymore.
Come on,

883
00:50:16.331 --> 00:50:20.290
we can get a couple more tanks then it's only four o'clock he'll be fine.

884
00:50:20.291 --> 00:50:22.290
It was such a weird phenomenon.
You see,

885
00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:26.160
you'll see that that shift where it just looks like whatever,
you know,

886
00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:27.990
higher part was to be driving.
The

887
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:31.190
<v 5>ship is just gone,
you know?
And that that base,</v>

888
00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.650
it's just pure monkey that's there at that.

889
00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.010
<v 0>All you have to remember folks is some people are allergic to peanuts.</v>

890
00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:42.180
That's all you have to remember.
Some people eat peanuts and it's like you are I,

891
00:50:42.181 --> 00:50:44.400
peanuts are delicious and we enjoy them.
You know,

892
00:50:44.401 --> 00:50:46.620
you would you like some peanuts?
Yeah,
sure.
Man.
What do you got?

893
00:50:46.621 --> 00:50:50.930
I got honey roasted.
Oh Shit.
That's my honey roasted peanuts.
But other people,

894
00:50:50.931 --> 00:50:54.210
if that's poison,
that's death.
You know?

895
00:50:54.211 --> 00:50:58.110
That's always been my argument for like these doctor drew type characters that

896
00:50:58.111 --> 00:51:02.760
are like,
you know,
the amount of people addicted to day to marijuana is what?

897
00:51:02.761 --> 00:51:06.060
One eighth of the amount of people that die from peanuts.
What's the number?

898
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:09.690
You got a number?
I'm she do.
How about you say that?
Be More responsible.

899
00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:14.430
You're talking about a few Weirdos.
If there is an actual physical addiction,

900
00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:18.000
it's so rare that they don't even understand the mechanism behind it.

901
00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:20.820
They don't understand.
It's not like opiate addiction.

902
00:51:20.821 --> 00:51:23.100
It's not like the withdrawal the people get from alcohol,

903
00:51:23.101 --> 00:51:26.400
which can actually kill you.
People don't know that if you just,

904
00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:30.060
if you're a daily drunk and you get off alcohol,
you could die.

905
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:33.570
It's happened to people.
They suspect that's what happened to Amy Winehouse.

906
00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:37.160
They think that she might've just stopped drinking or tried to stop drinking and

907
00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:41.370
her body just shut the fuck down because it was just living with alcohol.

908
00:51:41.371 --> 00:51:44.790
It just adopted its systems to burn the alcohol.

909
00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:49.230
The adaptive human beings survives and the face of poison.

910
00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:51.850
<v 5>That's crazy.
Do you know there was,
I was reading and I,</v>

911
00:51:51.851 --> 00:51:54.420
I certainly need to do some followup research on it,

912
00:51:54.421 --> 00:51:57.450
but the same article that was talking about the epigenetics and Bruce Lipton,

913
00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.350
they were mentioning a case where there is somebody who had multiple personality

914
00:52:01.351 --> 00:52:05.160
disorder and they had,
so they had split personalities.

915
00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:08.760
One of their personalities.
If that person ate strawberries,

916
00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:12.270
they get totally fucked up like hives.
You know,

917
00:52:12.271 --> 00:52:13.800
all kinds of bad shit would happen.

918
00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:18.960
But if the other personality ate strawberries,
then they were fine.

919
00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:22.290
Now I've got to find this.
If anybody finds it out that that'd be yes.

920
00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:26.670
So I was reading the article,
uh,
it was basically,
did you say Bruce Lipton?
Yeah,

921
00:52:26.671 --> 00:52:29.660
it was quoting him alive and then it was talking about it.
But it,

922
00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:33.120
let's see if we can try and find if that's real,
because that is really,

923
00:52:33.121 --> 00:52:36.840
that is really interesting where they're basically saying that your belief can

924
00:52:36.841 --> 00:52:40.440
go so far as to maybe peanut allergies are too much,

925
00:52:40.441 --> 00:52:45.270
but maybe the strawberry allergies weak enough that it's malleable enough based

926
00:52:45.271 --> 00:52:48.770
on your mind,
you know?
So that would be a real interesting kind of point.

927
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:51.870
<v 0>He was an interesting guy.
We had him on the podcast a while back.</v>

928
00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:56.130
It's been a while.
He's a,
he's a very smart,
very educated,

929
00:52:56.131 --> 00:52:57.510
but very hippy as well.

930
00:52:57.730 --> 00:53:01.740
It's an interesting combination of like a super smart old hippie was a,

931
00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:04.380
it's kind of some,
some fascinating ideas.
I don't,

932
00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:07.700
I don't know if I buy it all it's,
but I don't apply myself,
you know,
I dunno.

933
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:11.160
I mean,
I don't know.
That's the only intelligent answers.
I don't know.

934
00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:15.090
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's all,
it's fascinating.
He's uh,
he's obviously,

935
00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:18.180
he's one of those guys that believes in the observer effect.

936
00:53:18.181 --> 00:53:22.350
It's like the pure observer effect of a quantum physics.
But what,

937
00:53:22.351 --> 00:53:26.130
from what I've understood by talking to actual is that

938
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.920
<v 6>a lot of people misrepresent what the observer effect is.</v>

939
00:53:28.921 --> 00:53:33.921
And what it has more to do with is actually measuring the particles themselves

940
00:53:34.051 --> 00:53:35.820
that you interact with them when you measure them.

941
00:53:35.821 --> 00:53:39.900
And that may very have very well have an effect on what we're still like see

942
00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:43.770
saying,
oh,
by observing them you have an effect.
You sort of,

943
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:48.360
but also by measuring them,
by measuring the observation,

944
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:52.020
like you have an effect on it.
Like you,
you have an effect on these particles.

945
00:53:52.021 --> 00:53:54.180
They interact with the whole universe all around you.
So yeah,

946
00:53:54.181 --> 00:53:58.140
it might be that we sort of control our reality is some sort of a strange way or

947
00:53:58.141 --> 00:54:02.460
it might be that our reality hinges upon a fucking billion different factors,

948
00:54:02.461 --> 00:54:06.090
only of which were aware maybe eight or nine because that's all we need.

949
00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:08.790
Just like if you wave your hand over an earthworm,
he has no fucking idea.

950
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:09.580
You're there.
Yeah.

951
00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:12.660
It doesn't need to know he lives in the ground or this is a fucking dream.

952
00:54:12.661 --> 00:54:14.520
And we are the dreamers,
the dreamers and we,

953
00:54:14.521 --> 00:54:19.050
so by being the dreamers we can alter temping Algo Nova Song.

954
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:20.251
But you know,

955
00:54:20.251 --> 00:54:24.390
of course there's multiple dreamers so just one person can't really alter that

956
00:54:24.391 --> 00:54:27.510
much but they can do a little bit,
they can push a few particles around this way.

957
00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:29.600
You know,
I mean,
I think that's the point that,

958
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:31.890
that Bruce is trying to make is that,
you know,

959
00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:36.780
without using that kind of analogy of the dream,
but basically saying we are,

960
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.100
you know,
in,

961
00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:43.050
in effect very much a part of this reality and we can control and maneuver

962
00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:45.660
different things that we are not aware that we can do.
Well,

963
00:54:45.661 --> 00:54:50.030
all we need is like a movie or a book or something that hits a switch that

964
00:54:50.031 --> 00:54:52.890
changes a thought that gets you inspired,
that gets you to act,

965
00:54:52.891 --> 00:54:55.770
it gets you to do something you haven't done before and then a year later you

966
00:54:55.771 --> 00:54:59.430
live in a different life.
Dude,
I read your book.
I lost a hundred pounds.

967
00:54:59.431 --> 00:55:04.350
I mean all that shit is there because people like looking for a spark.

968
00:55:04.351 --> 00:55:09.180
They know that this goofy ass way we're living is,
it's,
it's silly.

969
00:55:09.181 --> 00:55:11.910
If you could engineer reality from scratch,

970
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:17.150
you wouldn't engineer $13 trillion where the data corrupt fucking to pol

971
00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:21.930
political system,
a fucked up medical system,
fucked up educational system.

972
00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:25.770
It wouldn't engineer that he figured out like if,
I'm sorry,
g our people,

973
00:55:25.771 --> 00:55:28.380
the same people that invented fucking computers,

974
00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:31.200
they're the same people and this was their solution for government.

975
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:34.080
I don't buy that.
I don't buy the designer solution for money.

976
00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:38.490
The same people figured out how to send video through the fucking air across the

977
00:55:38.491 --> 00:55:40.890
country and the matter of seconds,

978
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:46.040
a network of impossible wireless towers that sends a fucking video of you skiing

979
00:55:47.251 --> 00:55:52.251
in Colorado to your friend in Florida and it sends it to women seconds.

980
00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:55.980
Like what you're telling me,
they can't make a better thing than money.

981
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:58.980
They can't make a better thing than an ATM machine.

982
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:04.020
They can't figure out something better than stocks and bonds and insider

983
00:56:04.021 --> 00:56:05.850
trading.
What the fuck is insider trading?

984
00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:08.640
You're not supposed to use your knowledge.
Wait a minute.

985
00:56:08.641 --> 00:56:13.540
You're running a system that if you know about something in advance,
you,

986
00:56:13.541 --> 00:56:18.360
you,
you can profit off that.
So if you know we,
I have to make you not profit.

987
00:56:18.361 --> 00:56:20.730
What the fuck are you talk?
What do you like?

988
00:56:20.731 --> 00:56:23.850
Scourge of knowledge that's going to work.
It's

989
00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:28.660
<v 5>just the way to get Martha Stewart.
They wanted to control Martha.</v>

990
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:33.580
Well we're very good problem solvers as as monkeys,
but the problems that have,

991
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:33.881
you know,

992
00:56:33.881 --> 00:56:38.881
a monetary gain tend to be the problems that we attack the most readily.

993
00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:42.910
Whereas some of the other kind of femoral problems,

994
00:56:42.911 --> 00:56:44.860
we try to attack those and really the wrong ways.

995
00:56:44.861 --> 00:56:47.290
We throw pills at them and you throw some stuff.
Actually,

996
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:49.330
one thing I wanted to bring up is,
you know,

997
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:54.070
part of something that I realized is,
you know,
for myself when I would track,

998
00:56:54.071 --> 00:56:58.240
and I'm,
I'm generally a pretty happy dude,
but the times when I'm not happy,

999
00:56:58.241 --> 00:56:59.470
I really spent some time,

1000
00:56:59.471 --> 00:57:02.410
actually the float tank helped me with this and as I was,
you know,

1001
00:57:02.411 --> 00:57:05.710
we got a great new float center in Austin and so I was going through there.

1002
00:57:05.711 --> 00:57:06.700
I was like,
all right man,

1003
00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:10.390
what's up with the fucking days where you're not happy and what's going on

1004
00:57:10.391 --> 00:57:13.840
because that shouldn't exist.
I have so,
you know,
such a great life.

1005
00:57:13.841 --> 00:57:16.600
But there's times where these fox come in and I was like,
all right,

1006
00:57:16.601 --> 00:57:21.310
when I'm not happy,
it's because I'm stressed out of something.
You know?

1007
00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:21.730
That's,

1008
00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:25.750
that's generally what's what's happening and what that's doing is taking me out

1009
00:57:25.751 --> 00:57:27.970
of the present moment.
I'm no longer in the present moment.

1010
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:31.450
I'm either worried about something in the past or I'm thinking about something

1011
00:57:31.451 --> 00:57:36.451
in the future and I'm not just living free in that moment to just enjoy what's

1012
00:57:37.061 --> 00:57:40.960
happening,
the conversation of others,
whatever else is going on,

1013
00:57:40.961 --> 00:57:45.610
I'm in my own head.
Well,
what's causing that?
Well,
what's causing that is fear.

1014
00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.580
At a certain point because you're stressed,
distressed,

1015
00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:52.420
the root of stress is fear.
You're either worried about something,
you know,

1016
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:53.440
losing something,

1017
00:57:53.441 --> 00:57:56.950
so you're afraid of that or you're afraid of something changing.

1018
00:57:56.951 --> 00:58:00.400
You're afraid of part of your identity changing and so,

1019
00:58:00.401 --> 00:58:02.110
but what's at the root of the fear then?

1020
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:04.420
So if we figure that fear is at the very base of that,

1021
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:08.230
what's at the root of the fear is attachment and identity.

1022
00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:10.690
And so if you're attached to,

1023
00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:13.990
even if I'm attached to something that I love very much,
like let's say on it,

1024
00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.200
you know,
I love it with,
I love that company.
I love what we're doing,

1025
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.090
but if I'm attached to it,

1026
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:23.890
then I'm terrified that something will happen to this and I'll cart start

1027
00:58:23.891 --> 00:58:26.950
creating these machinations in my head,
you know,

1028
00:58:26.951 --> 00:58:31.210
because it will feel like part of me is dying if,
if that goes away.

1029
00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:34.810
So if I can just remove the attachment and say,
Hey,
guess what?

1030
00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:37.300
I'm still a monkey.
I still got my hands.
I still,

1031
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.680
I'm still okay without all this other stuff,
without,
if,

1032
00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:44.290
if my relationships failed,
if everybody around me died,
you know,

1033
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.930
I love him very much and they add to the richness of my life.

1034
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:49.960
But to not be attached and to say,
you know what,

1035
00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:53.350
I'm going to enjoy the hell out of him,
but that's not me.
You know,

1036
00:58:53.351 --> 00:58:56.650
I'm still just a being that exists and I'll be okay.

1037
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:59.680
And then that starts to eradicate the fear.

1038
00:58:59.681 --> 00:59:02.680
And then when the fear starts to go away,
then the stress starts to go away.

1039
00:59:02.681 --> 00:59:04.030
When the stress starts to go away,

1040
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:07.000
you can live in the present moment and when you can be in the present moment,

1041
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:09.790
you can,
even if something's painful,
it's just pain.

1042
00:59:09.791 --> 00:59:13.480
It's not suffering so you can be happy.
And that was the fucking,

1043
00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:17.710
that was it for me.
Now doing that is super difficult.
Maybe for you.

1044
00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:22.550
I mean not so hot.
I got 150 dump on in there extra.

1045
00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:26.300
<v 0>I got plenty of room,
plenty of room in my brain.
Son.
Look at this man.</v>

1046
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:29.360
Look at this picture.
This is an MRI that someone posted on them.
The Rogan board,

1047
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:31.400
an Mri of a dude dying.

1048
00:59:32.370 --> 00:59:36.690
<v 1>Wow.
His brain's releasing all these endorphins.
Dhea is there.</v>

1049
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:40.300
Did they prove the DMT down?
Put the,
uh,
they haven't proved it.

1050
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:41.230
<v 0>Deep dump,</v>

1051
00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:46.230
but what they have proved is that the pineal gland in rats produces DMT rather

1052
00:59:46.361 --> 00:59:48.300
rats alive.
So they uh,

1053
00:59:48.370 --> 00:59:52.060
cut open a rat's head with a fucking hat shit and getting that little fucking

1054
00:59:52.061 --> 00:59:56.230
rat cock suckers head looked around and found out that um,

1055
00:59:57.290 --> 00:59:58.160
<v 1>the,
um,</v>

1056
00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:02.870
the rats do produce DMT and the actual pineal gland,

1057
01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:07.370
it says AMC in the corner there.
That's,
oh,
it's fake.
It's totally fake.

1058
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.180
That's totally fake then that's a scene from the walking dead and that is the

1059
01:00:11.181 --> 01:00:15.140
scene.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think what Bob,
of course it is,

1060
01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:17.870
well they don't have like lights to go off in your brain.

1061
01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:22.850
Like what's going on there?
You've got to fucking light show in your brain.

1062
01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:26.670
They uh,
it looks so fake to the cause.
Why,

1063
01:00:26.671 --> 01:00:28.790
why else can we see the blood vessels so clearly?

1064
01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:31.400
But everything else it's just that one pipe up to the head.

1065
01:00:31.401 --> 01:00:33.020
That's not how it fucking brains structured.

1066
01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:35.890
It's not all the pathways of veins and arteries are,

1067
01:00:35.891 --> 01:00:38.720
and your system is a lot of different shit going on.
If you ever read about the,

1068
01:00:38.721 --> 01:00:42.890
uh,
there's a letter from Aldous Huxley's wife who's that famous psychedelic

1069
01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.140
adventure wrote the island,

1070
01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:49.040
which is probably my favorite book and doors of perception.
And brave new world.

1071
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:51.380
He,
he died,
um,

1072
01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.040
after being administered a dose of Lsd by his wife.

1073
01:00:55.041 --> 01:00:59.570
And she tells this really moving writes is really moving letter about the whole

1074
01:00:59.571 --> 01:01:01.760
experience.
Have you got,
have you got a chance to read that ever?

1075
01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:04.310
No crazy bitch probably killed him.
She said,

1076
01:01:04.311 --> 01:01:08.470
well he told me to shoot him up with LSD at the end.
It was,

1077
01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:11.360
she had a bunch of people around.
There's the doctor.
Just kidding folks.

1078
01:01:11.361 --> 01:01:13.940
I don't really believe that.
Don't get mad at me and don't know.

1079
01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:18.740
I didn't really call her a bitch.
The person in my,
well,

1080
01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:19.890
so she,
you know,

1081
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.980
she tells a story of basically just coaching them through this kind of release

1082
01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:28.280
of the spirit.
Like it's all going to be easy.
It's going to be fine.

1083
01:01:28.281 --> 01:01:31.700
There's nothing but love and she's just coaches him through this.
And you know,

1084
01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:36.020
usually there's these big spasms at the end of death is your body's clinging to

1085
01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:39.840
life and whatever else is leaving and you shed and it's this,
this,

1086
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:45.320
and it goes.
But at,
you know,
with this Lsd and her kind of coaching him through,

1087
01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:50.300
it was just really kind of smooth pathway where you just kind of allowed the

1088
01:01:50.301 --> 01:01:53.090
spirit to exit.
And that's what the people who live with,
you know,

1089
01:01:53.091 --> 01:01:55.080
the Shamans and the medicine men,

1090
01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:59.150
they say observing their death is different than other people.

1091
01:01:59.151 --> 01:02:03.470
It's just they just go,
okay.
And allow that kind of transition to happen.

1092
01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:06.590
No one else would really do the trick.
Nyquil,

1093
01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.040
<v 0>if you get some of that old school nyquil before they outlawed it with the</v>

1094
01:02:10.041 --> 01:02:14.030
codine in it,
son drank a whole bottle of Nyquil and yeah,

1095
01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:18.650
<v 1>meet your maker.
You just be confused as fuck.
He was like,
what?</v>

1096
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:20.160
What happened to eve?
The mad

1097
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.930
<v 0>you wouldn't even,
you'd be cool with it.
You be like,</v>

1098
01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:25.980
I'm just nosy or mushroom.

1099
01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.130
I'm going to melt through this bed and right into the next dimension of

1100
01:02:29.131 --> 01:02:32.850
existence.
I'm just going to go way back right into it

1101
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:35.783
and expire.

1102
01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.940
<v 5>That's the,
uh,
you know,
go into that maps conference this year.</v>

1103
01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:44.210
Some of the best research is going on right now.

1104
01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:48.750
I tell people what maps are multidisciplinary association of Psychedelic studies

1105
01:02:48.751 --> 01:02:51.600
and they're on the forefront of doing a lot of the research on the different

1106
01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.970
psychedelic medicines.
A couple other groups,

1107
01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:57.120
the Heffter institute is really keen on the mushroom studies that they're doing

1108
01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:01.080
and they're doing a lot with palliative care people at the end of their life who

1109
01:03:01.081 --> 01:03:03.870
are suffering and generally just getting all these painkillers,

1110
01:03:03.871 --> 01:03:07.710
which kind of knock them out,
keep them sleepy,
keep them a little deranged.

1111
01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:12.210
And they started giving them,
you know,
mushrooms and they do a controlled trial,

1112
01:03:12.211 --> 01:03:13.560
placebo and mushrooms,

1113
01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:16.740
which is kind of absurd as they mentioned because you can totally tell when

1114
01:03:16.741 --> 01:03:17.060
something's,

1115
01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:19.740
<v 0>I'm not sure if someone's not,
I'm not sure.
Oh yeah,</v>

1116
01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:23.410
I totally got the mushroom dose,
Dude.
I'm tripping my balls.

1117
01:03:23.411 --> 01:03:27.250
All the clinician's kind of configure it out,
but it's tough to tough to go.

1118
01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.640
I think they give them Niacin or something if they for the placebo control,

1119
01:03:30.641 --> 01:03:34.900
just so they feel something.
Well if you weak minded,
you can,
uh,
you know,
you can,

1120
01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:38.930
you could be convinced that you're on a drug.
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm 100% company.

1121
01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:41.120
You can hypnotize somebody and could turn some.

1122
01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:43.700
So what was the results by the results?

1123
01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:45.550
<v 5>The results are just,
you know,
you start,</v>

1124
01:03:45.810 --> 01:03:48.750
these people are allowed to kind of write their stories and you can start

1125
01:03:48.751 --> 01:03:50.340
reading their stories about what,

1126
01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:54.720
how their whole interaction with their own life,
how they look at their life,

1127
01:03:54.721 --> 01:03:57.480
how they look at death,
how they look,
their relations with their family.

1128
01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:01.120
All of these things changing from these heroic doses of silicide,

1129
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:02.100
but at the end of their life.

1130
01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:06.000
<v 0>That's amazing.
You know,
it's really amazing.
It's easy to grow.
Yeah.</v>

1131
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:09.540
It's not hard.
It's not like corn,
you know,
if these pesticides,

1132
01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:13.170
is that going to eat it?
Scroll it.
You don't need that much either.

1133
01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:17.020
I know you don't need a lot.
It's an amazing secret.
It's,

1134
01:04:17.021 --> 01:04:21.390
it's amazing that something this powerful is somehow or another demonized.

1135
01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:23.010
It's something,
this,
uh,

1136
01:04:23.011 --> 01:04:27.000
this tense and this mind blowing is somehow know there've been put in the

1137
01:04:27.001 --> 01:04:30.600
category of things that we should have.
Follied keeps your sanity.

1138
01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:34.380
What are you going to let slip away to the world of fantasy?

1139
01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:38.520
You got to play world of Warcraft.
Aubrey,
you are a God damn grown man.

1140
01:04:38.521 --> 01:04:42.350
Don't you think it's time you started a family?
Pay Some fucking taxes.

1141
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:47.100
Did you hear what they did in France?
No.
Dude.
France,
Jack,

1142
01:04:47.101 --> 01:04:50.880
their tax rate up to 75% for rich people.

1143
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:56.490
That's rude for corporations and for like the wealthy top whatever percent.

1144
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:59.310
They just decided we're going to steal your money to fix our problems.

1145
01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.860
We're going to steal your money to fix her and competence.

1146
01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:05.760
The problem is is that the people who are taking the money are going to fucking

1147
01:05:05.761 --> 01:05:08.850
spend it and ridiculous the stupid way.
Exactly.

1148
01:05:08.851 --> 01:05:11.610
That's what pissed me off about reading the responses because all these fucking

1149
01:05:11.611 --> 01:05:14.580
haters out there,
then you're a good finally about time.

1150
01:05:14.581 --> 01:05:18.160
We need to do that in America.
Uh,
you want to give the government more

1151
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.160
<v 6>fucking money?
Yeah,
but you see what they're doing with the money we have.</v>

1152
01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.110
What could what?
They're doing this NSA shit.

1153
01:05:23.111 --> 01:05:25.660
That's who do they pay for that you did?
I did.
We paid for it.

1154
01:05:25.661 --> 01:05:27.940
We both paid for it.
We all paid for it.
You want to give them more,

1155
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:31.510
you want to give him more and let them just come up with Moore's way to fuck us

1156
01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:34.990
more.
More ways to lie to us.
Better ways to trick us.
Random people.

1157
01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.330
Better way to turn your fucking cell phone on while you're jerking off.
Oh,

1158
01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:40.150
you need more.
Look at this.

1159
01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:44.440
75% tax for top earners will be levied on company's proposal.

1160
01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:48.250
Infuriated business leaders in soccer clubs,
soccer clubs.
That means like a,

1161
01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.250
like a fucking soccer club.
Like one of their leagues.

1162
01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:54.490
They would call it a club like premier league.
So if they're making $100 million,

1163
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.280
the government wants seven,
eight,
five eve.

1164
01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:02.050
Tell me that fucking money.
We're doing the best we can.
No,

1165
01:06:02.051 --> 01:06:05.620
you don't deserve half of your money that you earned.
You got to get

1166
01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:11.740
<v 1>not even half,
75% what are rotten cunt of a country?</v>

1167
01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.780
It's brutal.
You imagine if you were living there,

1168
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:16.450
they wanted 75% but we're just going to move.
I mean,

1169
01:06:16.451 --> 01:06:20.140
it's going to be a mass exodus out of France that you're just stealing money.

1170
01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.320
You,
you know what you should say.
You should be able to say,
okay,
how about this?

1171
01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.910
How about instead of paying taxes,

1172
01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:30.120
we guarantee a certain amount of money will be funding funneled privately into

1173
01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:34.860
community centers and parks and libraries.
Yeah.

1174
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:38.230
We just guarantee that every business that makes x amount of dollars,

1175
01:06:38.231 --> 01:06:41.080
we'll get to choose which way their money goes.

1176
01:06:41.081 --> 01:06:43.960
Either you're getting trusted in the hand of the federal government,
which will

1177
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:48.350
<v 6>fucking do whatever they want and make FEMA camps or,
or</v>

1178
01:06:48.490 --> 01:06:53.050
<v 1>you could specifically have a channeled into,
no,
I cut a check to,
you know,</v>

1179
01:06:53.170 --> 01:06:56.910
this company that builds parks in bad neighborhoods so I don't need to pay you

1180
01:06:56.911 --> 01:06:57.970
anymore.
Oh No.

1181
01:06:57.971 --> 01:07:02.920
All my money went into making sure that the educators got raises and that people

1182
01:07:02.921 --> 01:07:07.921
who teach my fucking kids and school can pay their bills and not shit their

1183
01:07:08.171 --> 01:07:10.750
pants at the end of every fucking month because they don't have enough money for

1184
01:07:10.751 --> 01:07:11.840
food.
That's what,

1185
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:14.980
that's what what you're doing to teachers paying teachers $30,000 a year.

1186
01:07:14.981 --> 01:07:17.980
What the fuck kind of Shit is that?
It's ridiculous actually.
You know,

1187
01:07:17.981 --> 01:07:21.310
it's actually a brilliant thought and should be the way it goes.
I mean,

1188
01:07:21.311 --> 01:07:24.190
if everybody could make decisions to put it and you know,

1189
01:07:24.191 --> 01:07:28.030
you have to obviously have a certain amount of legitimate causes that everybody

1190
01:07:28.031 --> 01:07:29.020
kind of agrees on.

1191
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:34.000
But if you just took your money and let's say tax was 10% to maintain fucking

1192
01:07:34.001 --> 01:07:37.150
roads or police or whatever,
whatever you had to do as,

1193
01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:40.270
as like a very low percent.
And then the rest you just said,
all right,

1194
01:07:40.271 --> 01:07:43.840
now you've got to give the other 40 to shit that matters.
That matters to you.

1195
01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.660
All the sudden,
all the stuff that was important,
you know,

1196
01:07:46.661 --> 01:07:51.040
would get done in an effective and efficient manner because there would be

1197
01:07:51.041 --> 01:07:54.760
competition,
there would be people saying,
if you give money to me,
you know,

1198
01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:58.630
I'm going to put 90% of this money back into the cause you want rather than

1199
01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:02.770
fucking circulating and around losing 70%,
which is,
you know,

1200
01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:06.180
we already have that in place now with the different,
um,
you know,

1201
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:07.480
charities that you can give to,

1202
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:12.220
they exist and eventually the best ones will continue because they're doing the

1203
01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:14.080
most good.
You know?
And that's,

1204
01:08:14.081 --> 01:08:16.250
if you could create that system instead of these crazy

1205
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:19.520
<v 0>taxes,
shit,
would it be a lot better?
But give people two options,</v>

1206
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.200
option a or option B,

1207
01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:24.800
option a is he give the government all your money and you say,
hey,
good luck.

1208
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:28.220
Take care of my cash that I worked so hard for.
We love you.

1209
01:08:28.221 --> 01:08:30.920
I love the fact that you spy on me.
Here's,
here's some money,

1210
01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:36.110
here's some money that you have to give to some assholes who you're paying to

1211
01:08:36.111 --> 01:08:39.890
spy on you.
You're paying to protect you.
So they decided the world the way,

1212
01:08:39.891 --> 01:08:42.860
the best way to protect you to look at your Dick Pictures,
Mr Marcus,

1213
01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:46.010
I've got to get into your IFO and turn your camera on while you're taking a
shit.

1214
01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:46.611
You know,

1215
01:08:46.611 --> 01:08:50.000
that's the best way person gets in the podcast with this instead of the guy's a

1216
01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:54.260
good guy,
he's got a lot of knowledge.
You know that.
I mean that,
that,
that's a,

1217
01:08:54.261 --> 01:08:56.720
that's a ridiculous proposition.
It's a ridiculous,

1218
01:08:56.750 --> 01:09:00.110
absolutely insane proposition that you're paying someone to do that.

1219
01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:03.850
If you have two options,
one,
you could do that or to you,
can you,

1220
01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:07.880
are you made x amount of money?
Say me,
you made $50,000 this year.

1221
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:10.250
If you made $50,000 this year,
you know,

1222
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:15.370
x amount of hundred dollars should have to go towards these funds are towards,

1223
01:09:15.471 --> 01:09:16.520
you know,
whatever it is.

1224
01:09:16.521 --> 01:09:21.290
Either it's going to be an anonymous dump off at the federal government or
let's,

1225
01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:25.250
let's put specific things in the public's hand,
like say,
listen,

1226
01:09:25.251 --> 01:09:27.440
federal government,
we've been thinking and uh,

1227
01:09:27.441 --> 01:09:29.450
we just think you're too busy and this is what it is.

1228
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:32.630
You just got too much going on,
man.
You can't pay attention.
Look,
I know how I am.

1229
01:09:32.890 --> 01:09:36.290
Like when I got too much going on.
I'm a fucking,
I'm very flighty.

1230
01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:39.560
I can't get it together.
It's clear that you're,
you're in over your head,

1231
01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:44.420
so let's do this.
Let's have you guys only make like really important laws.

1232
01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:48.380
You work on that stuff.
We're kind making sure that you know,

1233
01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:51.960
big corporations can't dump shit into rivers.
You guys watching that?
He painted,

1234
01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.500
he didn't pay attention.
Yeah,
go fix that.

1235
01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.800
So fix that and only concentrate on that shit.

1236
01:09:57.801 --> 01:10:01.160
Can't use pesticides that are going to deplete the world's bee population.

1237
01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:04.130
From now on,
we're going to take over the military.

1238
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:08.390
We're going to take over food and we're going to take over education.

1239
01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:10.310
Just the people.
Look,
I'm not saying that we're going to,

1240
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:12.470
we're not going to stop you from running things we want.

1241
01:10:12.471 --> 01:10:16.370
Everyone thinks we just think you might have too much power,
too much power.

1242
01:10:16.371 --> 01:10:21.200
You seem like regular people and yet you decide wars could happen and that

1243
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:23.740
natural resources should be extracted from [inaudible].

1244
01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:25.760
How did you get to this position where you have that kind of power?

1245
01:10:25.761 --> 01:10:28.790
That's not what you should be there for.
Every category was donation based.

1246
01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:33.650
How many people would be ponying up to give $1 million for a new missile to go

1247
01:10:33.651 --> 01:10:36.350
launch at some point like,
oh yeah,

1248
01:10:36.351 --> 01:10:39.890
I'm going to take my tax dollars and give it to you cause I think I can get one

1249
01:10:39.891 --> 01:10:42.260
eighth of this new missile that's going to blow up.

1250
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:47.470
Maybe some questionably bad guys but likely some mix of good and bad people.

1251
01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:52.730
Government is a public funded gun nut.
That's what it is.
Have you ever met a gun?

1252
01:10:52.731 --> 01:10:55.640
Not like my friend Justin.
You Know My,
I love that dude.
He's a gun nut,

1253
01:10:55.641 --> 01:10:58.460
a legit gun night.
He's got hundreds of guns.
He's got guns everywhere.

1254
01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:00.230
He won't even tell you how many guns he has.

1255
01:11:00.231 --> 01:11:03.230
Cause if you knew how many guns he has,
he would go,
what the fuck dude?

1256
01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:06.290
Like he like somebody asked him this weekend how many guns you have.

1257
01:11:06.291 --> 01:11:10.040
I think Brian Callen did.
And he goes,
man,
if I even started going down that road,

1258
01:11:10.041 --> 01:11:14.640
you would think I'm crazy.
He like more than enough.

1259
01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:17.450
More than it.
I'll keep,
doesn't even say how many he does.

1260
01:11:17.451 --> 01:11:20.250
He probably don't even know.
He might not even know that's our government.

1261
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:21.480
Why do you have enough warheads?

1262
01:11:21.481 --> 01:11:24.660
Kill everyone in the planet a million times over.
Don't you just need a couple?

1263
01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:26.310
Like how many are enemies?

1264
01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:30.500
Are you looking to launch missiles that at any given time do you have to?
Oh,

1265
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:32.640
we have to be close to them.
Okay.
How close do you have to be?

1266
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.320
We have bases in like a hundred different fucking countries with killer weapons

1267
01:11:37.321 --> 01:11:40.950
in them.
Just sitting there waiting.
I'll fuck people off.
They talk some shit,

1268
01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:44.470
<v 1>Matt.
Insane.
Insane.
And then you know,</v>

1269
01:11:44.471 --> 01:11:49.471
you get the get the news media who's taking some payments to tell people what

1270
01:11:49.901 --> 01:11:53.530
they want to hear to support these crazy wars.
They fucked themselves.

1271
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:56.950
<v 0>They're a goddamned Don Henley song.
Kick him when the kicker,</v>

1272
01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:02.470
remember that dirty laundry?
That song was the shit back in the day,
man.

1273
01:12:02.471 --> 01:12:04.270
That song was a,
she did.
There was a,

1274
01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.410
there was like a poignant song that had a message that was a cool song about

1275
01:12:08.411 --> 01:12:11.890
this weirdness of people putting things on television.

1276
01:12:11.891 --> 01:12:13.830
It's negative to get people to go,
Oh and ah,

1277
01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.710
and you're in a way social engineering and that's all we had access to.

1278
01:12:17.711 --> 01:12:18.730
We couldn't do anything.
We,

1279
01:12:18.731 --> 01:12:22.140
the news was the fucking news was the fucking news and it took,

1280
01:12:22.141 --> 01:12:23.380
when Don Henley wrote that,

1281
01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:27.520
I mean they barely had cable when cable news was like just CNN.

1282
01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:30.220
There was no fox propaganda network.

1283
01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:33.850
There was no CMBC with all their fucking liberal silliness.
There's none of that.

1284
01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.220
It's receipt.
Which one is the liberal one?

1285
01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:41.080
MSNBC because I didn't want to him what it said,
silver play.
Is it a game?

1286
01:12:41.081 --> 01:12:43.780
There's a balancing act,
so we have to cover all our bases.

1287
01:12:43.781 --> 01:12:47.470
We've got our conservatives over on this hand and Alan Colmes steps and he's a

1288
01:12:47.471 --> 01:12:49.870
liberal,
but he's very wacky looking and it's easy to dismiss.

1289
01:12:49.871 --> 01:12:54.020
That's why we keep them on the network and then hot posey everywhere you look

1290
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:56.980
spread and Satan's message hot plus it,

1291
01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.130
crossing the legs back and forth.
If you have fat legs,

1292
01:13:00.131 --> 01:13:03.810
you can't work for Fox News period that you,
when you come in and yeah,

1293
01:13:03.850 --> 01:13:07.040
<v 1>come in your underwear.
Maybe they just say,
okay,
turn around,
you're hired,</v>

1294
01:13:07.041 --> 01:13:09.830
can you speak?
Do you know how to speak English?
And then you see,

1295
01:13:09.831 --> 01:13:13.210
so you get all this fame competition though that makes people think that they're

1296
01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:16.780
really trying hard to work shit.
And then you see those pictures from that,

1297
01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.660
that airplane flight where everybody's flying to Mandela's wet and they're like

1298
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:25.520
hanging out and George Bush or Obama,
they're being cooled their buddies.

1299
01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.310
It's all just the same shit.
You know,

1300
01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:32.320
they just fame this competition battling over these little details and shutting

1301
01:13:32.751 --> 01:13:37.100
down the government.
This is a grid lock.
They hate each other.
Hey,
don't,

1302
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:39.500
it's just the same fucking game that the same people.

1303
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:43.940
Could you imagine if you had an argument with someone and like say,
uh,
like

1304
01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.870
<v 0>all our friends out of all our friends,</v>

1305
01:13:45.871 --> 01:13:49.170
like you and Duncan got in an argument and you had a disagreement about

1306
01:13:49.171 --> 01:13:49.650
something.

1307
01:13:49.650 --> 01:13:53.460
So you came to us to discuss this disagreement and there was like maybe 10

1308
01:13:53.461 --> 01:13:54.990
people in the room and you start saying,

1309
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:58.380
my opponent has an idea of what happened that night,

1310
01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:00.660
but it's very different than mine.

1311
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:06.810
My opinion of what happened that night is based on fact.
You'd be like,
oh,

1312
01:14:06.811 --> 01:14:11.160
this is theatrical.
This is horse shit,
Arby's,
crazy.
Our be fucked up Dunkin.

1313
01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.100
And now he

1314
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.100
<v 6>and Doug,
he'd had,
he probably did something creepy and then he's,
he's,</v>

1315
01:14:15.101 --> 01:14:17.080
she's lying.
He's not telling the truth.
That's true.

1316
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:21.490
But we hear them say that and you just automatically say,
well,

1317
01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:24.560
that's how the president speaks.
That's how it guy speaks when he's making,
uh,

1318
01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:27.550
an important speech.
She's speaking this weird sort of fake way.

1319
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:31.750
And it's the same thing with the news guys.
Yeah.
When they're like,
you know,

1320
01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:36.910
the Obama administration announced the improvement in the economy to the tune of

1321
01:14:36.911 --> 01:14:41.840
200,000 jobs.
Dodododo Blah,
blah,

1322
01:14:41.841 --> 01:14:45.610
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
But bubba,
Bubba,
Bubba,
Bubba,

1323
01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:46.470
they're just like saint,

1324
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:50.640
they're talking in this professional rhythm of we'll be right back and every,

1325
01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:53.950
there's no sexiness.
That's everything's hidden.

1326
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:57.940
Even real sexiness is just,
you're allowed to be in your underwear,

1327
01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:02.380
but you can't go,
oh,
all right.
Anyway,

1328
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:09.040
<v 1>we'll be right back.
We'll be right back with more foxes,
no personality.</v>

1329
01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.970
You can only be a cunt or republican or hard ass.

1330
01:15:12.971 --> 01:15:16.000
You can be a hard ass and it could be a malty liberal,

1331
01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:19.070
but no other fucking real personality.
And then,
you know,

1332
01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:21.840
and then the other game that gets played too is,
you know,

1333
01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:23.500
there's these real issues going on,

1334
01:15:23.501 --> 01:15:26.260
really fucked up things that are happening that people should be paying

1335
01:15:26.261 --> 01:15:28.120
attention to,
like all the spying stuff.

1336
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:33.100
But then meanwhile it'll be 24 seven coverage about the knockout game.

1337
01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:35.590
You know,
that's something to be afraid of people.

1338
01:15:35.591 --> 01:15:38.860
You could just be walking down the street and some kid could punch you right in

1339
01:15:38.861 --> 01:15:43.570
the head and then you'll be knocked out and it's a rampant issue.
Okay.
Yeah,

1340
01:15:43.571 --> 01:15:44.231
it's fucked up.

1341
01:15:44.231 --> 01:15:47.680
Some kids are fucking assholes and they're punching people in the head for no

1342
01:15:47.681 --> 01:15:49.150
reason.
Well,
guess what?

1343
01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:52.630
They'd been shooting people for no reason for a long time too.

1344
01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.120
And Aubrey,
Marcus,

1345
01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:59.500
not good old fashioned white Americans.
Start to look at that and it's like,

1346
01:15:59.530 --> 01:16:04.000
this is just something to keep you distracted and keep you fucking not focused

1347
01:16:04.001 --> 01:16:05.530
on the real shit.
It isn't.
It isn't.

1348
01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:09.400
It's actually just we know you'll listen and that's how you sell cars.
You know?

1349
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:13.480
If I've got a Toyota commercial and the,
you know the commercial pays x amount.

1350
01:16:13.481 --> 01:16:16.600
If you get this kind of ratings,
but y amount,
if you get that kind of ranks,

1351
01:16:16.601 --> 01:16:19.630
I'm looking for y.
If the knockout games got to get me,
why

1352
01:16:20.190 --> 01:16:24.840
<v 6>is that a house in the Hamptons,
Aubrey Marcus,
a big place facing the ocean,</v>

1353
01:16:24.841 --> 01:16:29.430
so I'm going to stand outside with my big card and go fuck the world.
I win.

1354
01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.110
Yeah,
I'm on antidepressants,

1355
01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:35.660
but I got over a hundred million dollars or $100 million.

1356
01:16:35.670 --> 01:16:36.503
You Fuck?

1357
01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:40.450
<v 1>That's what it is.
It's the demon and all of us.
It's the apple come to life.</v>

1358
01:16:40.451 --> 01:16:45.100
The serpents,
apple.
I really think that a lot of this,
lot of this depression,

1359
01:16:45.101 --> 01:16:46.360
you mentioned the antidepressants.

1360
01:16:46.361 --> 01:16:49.270
I think a lot of it comes from when you've been doing,

1361
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:53.020
and sometimes I of course there's chemical reasons health and a lot of a lot of

1362
01:16:53.021 --> 01:16:54.460
people would tell three there's a lot of,

1363
01:16:54.461 --> 01:16:56.470
there's a lot of kind of physical stuff that can happen.

1364
01:16:56.471 --> 01:16:57.970
But I think with a lot of these people,

1365
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.690
they're depressed because whatever they know that they should do in their

1366
01:17:01.691 --> 01:17:03.520
deepest,
truest self,

1367
01:17:03.730 --> 01:17:08.290
that self that will exist beyond the confines of this dream,
that sa,

1368
01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:10.340
that part to almost

1369
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:14.420
<v 5>distanced themselves from this fucking monkey that's making these ridiculous</v>

1370
01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:16.910
choices,
lying to people,
hurting people.

1371
01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:19.390
So it starts to pull out and there's this vacuum,

1372
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.610
there's this void that's created inside people when their higher self,

1373
01:17:22.611 --> 01:17:25.340
their true itself,
whatever the language you want to use,

1374
01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:29.180
when that starts to go away because it's horrified at what this monkey's doing.

1375
01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:34.040
And then so you get this vacuum and you can't find a way to fill it.

1376
01:17:34.041 --> 01:17:37.100
You can't find a way to bring it back.
So you just shove it with pills.

1377
01:17:37.101 --> 01:17:42.101
So severs that communication even farther so you can't hear that lonely whisper

1378
01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:45.740
of your highest self saying,
please,
please come back,
please stop,

1379
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:48.100
please come back.
And you just don't even hear it anymore.

1380
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:50.870
But then you're even more fucked up and more sad.
You know?

1381
01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:54.980
I really think that that's a lot of what's going on and whether you want to take

1382
01:17:54.981 --> 01:17:59.150
that as literal or take that as just analogous to not being,

1383
01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:04.010
acting in accord with what you know at your deepest level is the right thing to

1384
01:18:04.011 --> 01:18:05.390
do.
I think that's a lot of the costs.

1385
01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:09.990
<v 6>It's,
it's certainly could be in some cases.
I mean,
you know,
who knows what the,</v>

1386
01:18:10.170 --> 01:18:11.820
I'm not a depressed person,

1387
01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:14.730
but I have friends that have had real struggles with depression.

1388
01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.400
People that I respect very much.
And um,

1389
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:19.830
and I know people that have benefited from medication.

1390
01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:22.770
I don't know what causes depression.
I don't know if it's environmental.

1391
01:18:22.771 --> 01:18:24.630
I don't know if it's chemical.
I don't know if it's genetic.

1392
01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.900
I think there's probably many,
many,
many,
many,
many,
many factors.

1393
01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:31.440
But I do know there are a lot of people that are depressed because of choices

1394
01:18:31.441 --> 01:18:34.980
they made in life and because of a road that they went down because of a path

1395
01:18:34.981 --> 01:18:37.140
they didn't pursue because of a passion.

1396
01:18:37.141 --> 01:18:41.880
They didn't indulge because of a friendship.
They didn't,
whatever,
you know,

1397
01:18:41.881 --> 01:18:45.810
whatever the fuck it is,
but whatever bumps people out,
there's a lot of factors.

1398
01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:47.820
It's not just genetic.
There's a lot of other shit.

1399
01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:51.960
And they've also said recently that exercise is proven to be as effective in

1400
01:18:51.961 --> 01:18:55.860
medication and treating people that have never taken a antidepressants.

1401
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:59.580
Like instead they've tried people on antidepressants and they've tried people to

1402
01:18:59.581 --> 01:19:02.610
just start really exercising on a regular basis and really get moving again.

1403
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:06.120
And they're like,
God,
I feel great.
This is amazing.
I've been doing that.

1404
01:19:06.121 --> 01:19:09.540
We take aerobics class and who takes the aerobics anymore?
I just make that up.

1405
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:12.140
I didn't even have aerobics class.
People are like,
with Jimmy,

1406
01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:15.990
you go new man camps now that happened is people,
it's crunchy socks.

1407
01:19:15.991 --> 01:19:19.520
You don't know.
You don't know bitch,
take a boxercise class,
you know,

1408
01:19:19.530 --> 01:19:23.160
go fucking go,
go figure out how to rollerskate.
It's fun.
You know,

1409
01:19:23.161 --> 01:19:25.660
go roller blading,
do something,
get your fucking heart pump.

1410
01:19:25.661 --> 01:19:29.230
And if you don't do that,
you are not going to feel as good.
Yeah.

1411
01:19:29.370 --> 01:19:32.430
And if you do do that,
then if there's still an issue,

1412
01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:34.980
okay then maybe you got something going on.

1413
01:19:35.010 --> 01:19:37.560
Cause it could've just been that you haven't fired your fucking engine up.

1414
01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.830
You haven't cleaned your pipes out.
You know,
you've got rust in your pipes,

1415
01:19:40.831 --> 01:19:43.950
ever go away on vacation,
you come back,
you turn your faucet on,
you're like,

1416
01:19:43.951 --> 01:19:46.980
what the fuck is,
that's Russ pitch and get some rust.
Your pipes.

1417
01:19:46.981 --> 01:19:47.970
You weren't using your pipes.

1418
01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:53.100
<v 5>Yeah,
no doubt.
Or when you've,
you know,
if you got a savage hangover,
you know,</v>

1419
01:19:53.101 --> 01:19:54.420
and sometimes you let that,

1420
01:19:54.570 --> 01:19:57.870
what's basically happening is you have a lot of toxins that have accumulated in

1421
01:19:57.871 --> 01:20:00.360
your body that your liver is trying to process out.

1422
01:20:00.361 --> 01:20:04.830
You're trying to kind of get back to this normal baseline baseline.
Right?

1423
01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:08.130
Well,
it's not as dramatic a hangover,
but

1424
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:12.570
<v 6>a lot of people are living their whole lives with a certain degree of food and</v>

1425
01:20:12.571 --> 01:20:16.820
booze and medication and whatever unhealthy lifestyle hangover that you need

1426
01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:20.610
<v 7>at my fuck.
And I saw boy fan,
ah,</v>

1427
01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:25.200
I'm mother fucking makes me depressed.
If it wasn't for him,
I swear to God,

1428
01:20:25.201 --> 01:20:27.660
I'd be like,
everyday is fucking Disney land.

1429
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:32.680
<v 6>Yeah,
man.
It's never,
and it's not,
and it's not whatever you're going through,</v>

1430
01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:34.510
you know,
I think it's not too late.

1431
01:20:34.511 --> 01:20:37.740
And I think that's one of the things that a lot of people think.
It's like,
ah,

1432
01:20:37.741 --> 01:20:41.380
I'm too fucking far gone.
Bullshit.
You know,
at any given point,

1433
01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:44.320
there's ample time to do anything that you still want to do.

1434
01:20:44.321 --> 01:20:45.870
There's time enough for greatness there.

1435
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:48.750
There's time enough to be the best you that you could be.
For sure.
Yeah.

1436
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:53.500
And it all just,
you know,
the problem is,
and I have been guilty of this myself,

1437
01:20:53.501 --> 01:20:57.910
100%.
I'm,
I'm,
you know,
I've seen for fairly carefree for the most of the time,

1438
01:20:57.911 --> 01:21:01.960
but I'm incredibly self critical,
very self critical.
I keep it together,

1439
01:21:02.230 --> 01:21:06.040
but I'm very,
very hard on myself like on a regular basis.
So when I look back,

1440
01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:09.880
if I look back on anything I've ever done,
mistakes I've ever made,
um,

1441
01:21:09.970 --> 01:21:13.930
like paths that I,
you know,
something that I put out that I didn't quite think,

1442
01:21:13.931 --> 01:21:14.201
man,

1443
01:21:14.201 --> 01:21:17.350
maybe I'll just wait three months before release that or maybe I should have,

1444
01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:17.771
you know,

1445
01:21:17.771 --> 01:21:22.000
reedited that blog post a couple more times before I put it online or those

1446
01:21:22.001 --> 01:21:23.620
things drive me fucking crazy.

1447
01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:26.380
But the shitty things that I've done have driven me crazy,

1448
01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:28.570
but yelling at someone,
I didn't have to yell at them for whatever.

1449
01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:32.740
But the most important thing is always for all people to recognize it.

1450
01:21:32.741 --> 01:21:36.430
You're not who you were a year ago.
You're not who you were five years ago.

1451
01:21:36.431 --> 01:21:39.160
You're not who you were last week.
You're who you are now.

1452
01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:41.050
And this is the only shit you have control over.

1453
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:45.760
So you got to regulate how much you dwell on regrets of the past.

1454
01:21:45.761 --> 01:21:49.090
You really gotta be careful because it's good to have a little,

1455
01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:50.650
because my regrets,

1456
01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:55.860
whether it's things of professional nature or the very few regrets friendship

1457
01:21:56.111 --> 01:22:00.210
wise,
which is one thing that makes me very happy.
Um,
but you know,
there's,

1458
01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:03.400
there's life is strange.
There's a lot going on,
there's a,

1459
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:05.620
there's a lot of factors happening in life.

1460
01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:11.400
But for sure who I am now wouldn't have ever happened if I didn't fuck up.

1461
01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.770
If I didn't make those mistakes,

1462
01:22:14.771 --> 01:22:18.220
I wouldn't have understand the importance of friendship and kindness.

1463
01:22:18.221 --> 01:22:21.910
And if I hadn't been cruel at some point in my life or someone hadn't been cruel

1464
01:22:21.911 --> 01:22:25.090
to me,
I wouldn't understand the beauty of love.
I would have to,

1465
01:22:25.330 --> 01:22:28.840
I wouldn't understand the full range of it cause I hadn't felt the sting of

1466
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:30.430
nobody ever punches you in the face.

1467
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:34.060
You don't really appreciate safety because a lot of people don't even understand

1468
01:22:34.061 --> 01:22:36.220
what safety is.
You put all,
we're safe,
we're safe.

1469
01:22:36.221 --> 01:22:39.460
But you were so not safe at any moment.
You know?

1470
01:22:39.461 --> 01:22:42.490
And when someone's punched you in the face a bunch of times and you've been in a

1471
01:22:42.491 --> 01:22:45.160
street fight with some guy who barely knew he got in an argument with,

1472
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:50.260
there's something about regular safety that's sweeter.
Yeah,
it's more delicious.

1473
01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:52.180
It's more delicious.
It's,

1474
01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:56.290
it's way better to drive your car straight after you almost lost control on a

1475
01:22:56.291 --> 01:23:00.330
turn.
They're like,
wow.
And then you get back straight.
Like,
whoa.

1476
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.980
I'm not saying that you should go sideways around corners,

1477
01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:07.090
but I am saying is that there's a fucking Yin and a Yang to this world,
man,

1478
01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:10.660
and you've got to fuel yourself with the fuck ups.

1479
01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:14.560
And most people get stuck in these patterns because they define themselves as a

1480
01:23:14.561 --> 01:23:17.890
fuck up or they define themselves on the person who doesn't follow through on

1481
01:23:17.891 --> 01:23:22.810
their ideas or a person who doesn't pursue their real interest in loves the

1482
01:23:22.811 --> 01:23:24.340
defined yourself by that.
Well,
you know,

1483
01:23:24.341 --> 01:23:27.400
I guess fucking when I start things and I quit.
No you don't.
No,

1484
01:23:27.401 --> 01:23:31.840
you have started things and you quit and it gives you a horrible sense of regret

1485
01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:34.780
that's made you define yourself by that.
You don't have to do that.

1486
01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:36.250
You don't have to do that.

1487
01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.850
<v 5>You gotta,
you gotta forgive.</v>

1488
01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.800
You gotta learn and you got to fully forgive yourself and people you know.

1489
01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:45.210
<v 6>Here's a big one.
The number one,
his number one,
write it down.</v>

1490
01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:46.890
Write down everything you want to do.

1491
01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:50.070
I don't mean crazy shit like I'm going to be the prince of Brunei.

1492
01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:53.730
I'm going to have,
based on the moon,
shut up.
This is what I want you to do,
right?

1493
01:23:54.090 --> 01:23:58.350
Write down what you would like to fix about your life and then just if you're 30

1494
01:23:58.351 --> 01:24:00.600
pounds overweight,
you want to lose 30 pounds.
Do it the right way.

1495
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:04.020
Go start eating vegetables,
monitor your calories.
Write down what you eat,

1496
01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:08.820
exercise every day.
Force yourself to do it.
Say you're the general.

1497
01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:11.850
The brain is a general,
the troops of the body.
The troops don't want to listen,

1498
01:24:11.851 --> 01:24:14.760
but you go fuck you.
You listen and you get up and you do it.

1499
01:24:14.850 --> 01:24:18.540
And then you get to write it down.
And if you don't write it down,
you don't eat.

1500
01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:22.830
You don't fuck you don't shirk off.
You don't shower.
Write that shit down.

1501
01:24:22.831 --> 01:24:24.720
So you do it.
It's like brushing your teeth.

1502
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:26.490
It's not something I want to brush my teeth today.

1503
01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:29.370
What do you want your teeth to rot out of your head?
You fucking dunce.

1504
01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:32.970
Just do it.
Just do it and make yourself do it.
And if you do that,

1505
01:24:32.971 --> 01:24:35.940
if you write shit down and do that,
you can change who the fuck you all.

1506
01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:39.300
And guess what?
My friends today is New Year's Eve.
That's my purpose.

1507
01:24:39.301 --> 01:24:43.260
Time to write down stuff and do it.
So it is about,

1508
01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:47.450
this is the getting together bitches episode.
This is to get it together,

1509
01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:47.791
bitches up.

1510
01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:50.400
It seems so simple that you just get a pad and it could change your life.

1511
01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.460
A pat can change in life.
So just focus on that shit.

1512
01:24:53.461 --> 01:24:56.460
If you spend as much time as you do the at something to jerk off.

1513
01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:59.040
I was like focusing on the problems that you've got in your life.

1514
01:24:59.310 --> 01:25:00.740
Focusing on the,
the,
the,

1515
01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:03.330
the arguments that you've been in with people and how much of it could have been

1516
01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:04.860
your fault.
How much of it?

1517
01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:09.990
30% if you eliminated that 30% would it be 100% no argument?

1518
01:25:09.991 --> 01:25:12.870
Or with this guy,
just be an asshole.
You know what?
Are you sure?

1519
01:25:12.930 --> 01:25:17.100
Are you sure it's not a little bit two people are at fault here will we

1520
01:25:17.101 --> 01:25:20.880
eliminate possibilities?
We look at things rigidly.

1521
01:25:20.881 --> 01:25:25.380
We except the patterns is being logical and all of that.

1522
01:25:25.381 --> 01:25:29.160
A roads when you take psychedelics,
and that's why it's illegal.

1523
01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:32.430
You got government.
That's why.
That's where the government's care.

1524
01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:36.300
<v 5>So the other thing,
so I think you're right on the money with writing this down,</v>

1525
01:25:36.301 --> 01:25:37.500
but the other thing you gotta do,

1526
01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:41.760
the other thing you got to do is in order to feel like you deserve the best

1527
01:25:41.761 --> 01:25:45.240
things in life,
you got to love yourself and you have to forgive yourself.

1528
01:25:45.241 --> 01:25:49.890
And so in order to fully love who you are and feel like you deserve the best

1529
01:25:49.891 --> 01:25:53.640
things in life,
you gotta,
you gotta forgive all of these past transgressions.

1530
01:25:53.641 --> 01:25:55.350
We're not perfect.
You've got to go back.

1531
01:25:55.351 --> 01:25:59.580
And instead of using this lash to go and last yourself,
oh,
I'm a fucking idiot.

1532
01:25:59.581 --> 01:26:04.550
I'm on that ass.
I'm an Asshole,
I'm a pussy,
whatever.
And you're just constantly,

1533
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:05.331
<v 1>I'm an,
you know,</v>

1534
01:26:05.331 --> 01:26:09.290
just lashing yourself and punishing yourself for not living up to these

1535
01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:13.370
standards that you have.
You got to stop that Shit and you got to say,
listen,

1536
01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:15.770
I'm not perfect.
I'm not a perfect being.

1537
01:26:15.771 --> 01:26:18.500
I'm here learning and trying to do my best,

1538
01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.320
but I fucking forgive myself for what's happened.

1539
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:25.040
That's in the past that was a different me,
you know,
I forgive myself,

1540
01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:28.880
I love myself and I deserve happiness now you sound like an asshole.

1541
01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:32.330
I talking Shit and you deserve and all these different things.

1542
01:26:32.331 --> 01:26:36.200
So I did you a raise.
No,
none of that just happened.

1543
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:39.740
I'd be happy if I had a new corvette with the roof.

1544
01:26:39.741 --> 01:26:44.741
Do you take only we as humans deserve is our own self love and r and the

1545
01:26:45.471 --> 01:26:50.370
opportunity for Hap and community.
You know,
it's like the scene in the fucking,

1546
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:54.290
the into the wild when a dummy dies in the trailer,
right.

1547
01:26:54.330 --> 01:26:57.860
And he's out there by himself and he realizes that you can't enjoy nature when

1548
01:26:57.861 --> 01:27:01.880
you're by yourself.
It's something you enjoy more when you share it.
For sure.

1549
01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:05.930
We know when you go somewhere,
you know,
if you go somewhere just to be somewhere,

1550
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:08.730
like if you're there by yourself,
it's really fascinating.
But if you,

1551
01:27:08.731 --> 01:27:11.930
there was someone else and you get to talk about it,
it's better.
It's better,

1552
01:27:12.170 --> 01:27:16.700
you know?
Yeah.
Try Scuba diving by yourself.
Sucks.
How do you see that fish?
Oh,

1553
01:27:16.701 --> 01:27:19.460
it was only me who saw that shit when a Brian Callahan,

1554
01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:23.570
<v 0>uh,
and uh,
Steve Rinella and I went to,
um,
and Ryan Callahan.</v>

1555
01:27:23.571 --> 01:27:28.571
What's a Montana and a went hunting like half of what was amazing about it was

1556
01:27:29.331 --> 01:27:33.050
talking about it with your friends.
What do you like?
This place is fucking crazy.

1557
01:27:33.051 --> 01:27:35.360
Like we're looking around like,
dude,
I feel like I'm in a dream.

1558
01:27:35.361 --> 01:27:37.460
Like this doesn't even seem like a real place on earth.

1559
01:27:37.690 --> 01:27:39.770
Seems like I landed on some planet somewhere.

1560
01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:44.390
There's no phone towers,
no planes flying overhead.

1561
01:27:44.391 --> 01:27:48.260
There's nothing going on over here.
Man.
Very rarely you'll see a plane.

1562
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:53.210
But most of the time what you see is just mountains and the hills in a river and

1563
01:27:53.211 --> 01:27:55.370
no fucking humans.
None.

1564
01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:58.820
And every now and then an animal running for its life scattered across the

1565
01:27:58.821 --> 01:27:59.654
ground.
Yeah.

1566
01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:03.590
It's fascinating because you're there with your friends and you're looking

1567
01:28:03.591 --> 01:28:05.870
around.
You're like,
dude,
this place is amazing.
Like this is nuts.

1568
01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.580
And like someone was explaining to you,

1569
01:28:07.581 --> 01:28:10.940
like Steve Rinella would explained that this used to be a fucking ocean.

1570
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.300
It was an inland sea.
It was like called the Great Western inland sea.

1571
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:15.290
That's what Montana is,

1572
01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:17.390
and all of that through the Missouri River and the breaks.

1573
01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.900
But if I was there by myself,
it would be cool.

1574
01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.770
But when you think with other people are like,
Whoa,
this is awesome.

1575
01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:27.010
Like you will see a cool movie with your friends.
You get out of there like,
dude,

1576
01:28:27.011 --> 01:28:30.720
that fucking drug.
It's,
you know?
Right.
It's like there's some,

1577
01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:34.070
it was just communities.
Fucking hugely important.

1578
01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.020
It's hugely important for all of us.

1579
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:41.240
Being nice and having Nice friends and having nice times together and sharing.

1580
01:28:41.690 --> 01:28:45.890
When you share and joy,
it makes your joy amplify.
You know,
you,

1581
01:28:45.891 --> 01:28:49.010
you have a couple of drinks with some friends and some laughs and he fucking

1582
01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:52.700
feeling great.
You feel better because they feel great to,
you know,

1583
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:56.990
if we're out there partying and Ari Shaffir sit in the corner crying and be
like,

1584
01:28:57.110 --> 01:29:01.710
aw,
this is no fun.
I can't enjoy my night and my reality,
not Ari's,

1585
01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:02.130
I don't know what's

1586
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:06.380
<v 5>wrong with that silly bitch.
You are naturally empathic beings,
socks.</v>

1587
01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:08.070
So if you're being,
you know,
if you're,

1588
01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:12.480
if you're pulling for everybody else to have this mutually good experience,

1589
01:29:12.481 --> 01:29:13.500
it's going to magnify.

1590
01:29:13.650 --> 01:29:16.620
But if you're causing other people to have a negative experience,

1591
01:29:16.621 --> 01:29:20.310
even if you think you're inoculated to it,
you're not,
you know,
we're,

1592
01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:21.750
we're empathetic beings.

1593
01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.540
You're going to feel the hurt that you're doing to that person.

1594
01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:27.990
<v 6>You might just think it's reality,
right?
Because it's always been your reality.</v>

1595
01:29:28.170 --> 01:29:28.891
But the reality is,

1596
01:29:28.891 --> 01:29:32.180
is a cause and effect of what you feel from the world you exist.

1597
01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:35.150
<v 5>Yeah.
And those other subconscious levels that you're not really,</v>

1598
01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:40.120
you don't think are bothering you.
But that'll cause some suffering later.

1599
01:29:40.210 --> 01:29:43.420
<v 6>It's just so hard for people to see that because we're so fucking selfish.</v>

1600
01:29:43.421 --> 01:29:47.290
We want what we want,
you know,
and we want to eat Doug Cooke,
he fucked my dark.

1601
01:29:47.530 --> 01:29:50.380
We want what we want right now.
I'm going to sloop totally goes.

1602
01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:52.540
We want what we want right now.
You know?

1603
01:29:52.541 --> 01:29:54.850
And that's like one of the biggest problems with people.

1604
01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:58.150
We get selfish and because of that selfishness,

1605
01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:01.870
we don't realize that like if we're pulling out,

1606
01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:04.000
we're putting out something negative,

1607
01:30:04.001 --> 01:30:07.660
we're also pulling probably the same amount of negativity back from the reaction

1608
01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:11.890
that our actions give to other people.
No doubt.
And we like that.

1609
01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:15.280
That thing of you being happy and having the best time of your best friends.

1610
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:18.070
And then one of your best friends is crying.
What happens to your good time?

1611
01:30:18.250 --> 01:30:20.350
It goes away.
Your good time goes away.

1612
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:23.530
If you're having the best time and you found out that your your best buddy,

1613
01:30:23.770 --> 01:30:28.240
his dog just died.
They're like,
oh dude,
I'm sorry shit.
And you're hugging.

1614
01:30:28.241 --> 01:30:33.040
The guy's crying and like,
I'm sorry man.
Where's you wish a good time?

1615
01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:37.690
You good times gone.
It's only good time for everybody has a good time.
Yeah.

1616
01:30:37.810 --> 01:30:42.520
The world has to recognize that it's only a good time if everybody is having a

1617
01:30:42.521 --> 01:30:43.120
good time.

1618
01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:47.620
If you are the head vampire sucking the blood of the earth out of a giant iron

1619
01:30:47.621 --> 01:30:48.100
too,

1620
01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:51.670
you've shoved into an artery and then you're shooting everybody who comes near

1621
01:30:51.671 --> 01:30:53.560
it,
you know,
and you're,
you know,

1622
01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:57.130
defending your land or whatever the fuck we're doing when we're sucking oil out

1623
01:30:57.131 --> 01:31:00.250
of the earth,
if that's what you're doing,
look how,

1624
01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.820
look how that impacts other people.
Look at the effects of what you've done.

1625
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.360
Look at the effects globally.
Look at the effects locally.

1626
01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:09.700
Look at the effects to your vampire personality.

1627
01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:13.810
Look at the effects like could you doing it's community dude.
It can't enjoy it.

1628
01:31:14.410 --> 01:31:17.920
<v 5>If everybody else is suffering.
And the even more radical belief systems,</v>

1629
01:31:17.921 --> 01:31:18.880
you know of like the,

1630
01:31:19.190 --> 01:31:24.190
the Hawaiian Kahunas and they would basically say that we are all the same

1631
01:31:24.730 --> 01:31:26.890
person basically anyways in person is the wrong way,

1632
01:31:26.891 --> 01:31:28.810
but all the same source anyways.

1633
01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:33.220
So it's not even actually in reality,
not in the dream.
And the dream,

1634
01:31:33.221 --> 01:31:34.870
it's possible,
but in reality,

1635
01:31:34.871 --> 01:31:39.460
it's not possible to do something bad to anybody else and not be doing it to

1636
01:31:39.461 --> 01:31:44.200
yourself because we're all these fragments of the same source,
allegedly.

1637
01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:47.320
That's what they would say.
And then it's of course a more radical belief.

1638
01:31:47.321 --> 01:31:49.990
But either way,
you know it's going to either,

1639
01:31:49.991 --> 01:31:53.740
whether you think of it as us being empathetic beings and picking up on,

1640
01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:56.320
you know,
energy of them suffering versus us,

1641
01:31:56.500 --> 01:32:00.640
or you want to take that radical belief and say we're all part of the same thing

1642
01:32:00.641 --> 01:32:03.940
anyways.
And so if you're doing harm to some people on this side,

1643
01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:07.990
even if you can't see it,
you're doing harm to the whole dream,
you know?
Yeah.

1644
01:32:08.050 --> 01:32:10.900
<v 6>Well,
you know what it's like,
it's like this.
This is how I look at it.</v>

1645
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:15.250
Like if you were a person who took your garbage out and just threw it in a pile

1646
01:32:15.251 --> 01:32:16.810
beside your beautiful house,
I would,

1647
01:32:16.811 --> 01:32:19.300
if you had a beautiful house with a gate around it and you just threw your

1648
01:32:19.301 --> 01:32:23.230
garbage over the fence and he created this giant fucking stinking pile of

1649
01:32:23.231 --> 01:32:26.230
garbage.
But everything inside the fence was beautiful.
What would I say?

1650
01:32:26.530 --> 01:32:29.230
I'd say you're doing a Shitty job of managing your environment.

1651
01:32:29.231 --> 01:32:32.320
Like what are you doing?
Stupid was stupid idea.
This is well,

1652
01:32:32.321 --> 01:32:36.580
that is like how most of life is lived.

1653
01:32:36.730 --> 01:32:41.320
Most of life is lived like an asshole that's throwing garbage over the top
fence.

1654
01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:44.620
Like,
what is,
what's in the ocean?
Should we do something about that?
Should that,

1655
01:32:44.650 --> 01:32:47.500
should we talk about that instead of the fucking guy who does fake sign language

1656
01:32:47.501 --> 01:32:50.860
at the Mendell a funeral.
How about the fucking,
that garbage thing and the ocean.

1657
01:32:50.890 --> 01:32:53.710
How about that?
You guys want to do something about that?
Like,
no,
nobody,

1658
01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:57.700
nobody even pays attention to it.
Just throw it over that fence.
Just a whatever,

1659
01:32:57.701 --> 01:32:59.220
whatever,
whatever.
It's,

1660
01:32:59.890 --> 01:33:03.850
we've done a terrible job of managing our environment.
It's terrible,
terrible,

1661
01:33:03.851 --> 01:33:04.684
terrible job.

1662
01:33:04.810 --> 01:33:09.730
<v 5>Yeah,
no doubt.
No doubt.
I mean,
I think one of the things that,</v>

1663
01:33:09.810 --> 01:33:10.390
you know,
all right,

1664
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:14.470
we're talking about doing things to other people and of course that a lot of

1665
01:33:14.471 --> 01:33:17.920
people get that and they'd say,
yeah,
yeah,
no,
no,
you gotta be good to people.

1666
01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:21.340
But I really think that a big problem is that people aren't good enough to

1667
01:33:21.341 --> 01:33:24.430
themselves.
And I,
you know,
I've harped on this point a few times now,

1668
01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:29.050
but it's sometimes you give yourself an excuse to be mean to yourself to be

1669
01:33:29.051 --> 01:33:33.300
right.
Like talk,
you know,
the things that we say to ourselves.
You know,

1670
01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:34.130
when we look in the mirror,

1671
01:33:34.130 --> 01:33:37.160
imagine like if you look in the mirror and you're not happy with something and

1672
01:33:37.161 --> 01:33:39.940
about your body and say,
Oh,
you,
you fat.
Fuck.

1673
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:44.900
Imagine if somebody else came in and said,
oh,
you fat.
Fuck,
he wasn't you.

1674
01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:47.890
You know,
it wasn't,
you're just joking.
Of course you knew you're like,

1675
01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:52.300
that is fucking so rude,
rude as fuck.
But we do that to ourselves constantly.

1676
01:33:52.301 --> 01:33:52.511
You know,

1677
01:33:52.511 --> 01:33:55.300
we tell he's just tell ourselves that we're stupid or we tell ourselves we're

1678
01:33:55.301 --> 01:33:58.060
not good enough.
We got to stop that shit too,

1679
01:33:58.210 --> 01:34:02.200
because that is directly affecting,
you know,
many different factors,

1680
01:34:02.201 --> 01:34:05.290
not only yourself,
but how you're going to interact with other people.

1681
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:09.550
We gotta be better to our fucking selves as well as being better to the rest of

1682
01:34:09.551 --> 01:34:12.670
the world.
But sometimes people can be great to the world,

1683
01:34:12.850 --> 01:34:16.750
but just ruthless to themselves,
you know?
And that Shit's got to stop to,
yeah.

1684
01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:17.980
Learn from it.
You know,

1685
01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:21.220
you can be tough on yourself to a certain point by demanding better.

1686
01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:25.660
I like to call it,
and I learned this from Don Miguel Ruiz,
a ruthless self love.

1687
01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:30.580
He's the,
uh,
he's,
he wrote mastery love the four agreements.

1688
01:34:30.581 --> 01:34:34.390
He's from the old Toltec lineage of,
of knowledge.
What does that mean?

1689
01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:37.140
Old Toltec lineage of,
well,
the Toltec,
you know,

1690
01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:41.560
they allegedly were the ones who taught cast Denita his philosophy about the

1691
01:34:41.561 --> 01:34:42.394
warrior path.

1692
01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:46.720
And they lived in certain parts of central Mexico and kept this belief system

1693
01:34:46.721 --> 01:34:50.980
and tech,
um,
tail t Wilcon was replaced where they live for a while.

1694
01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:52.650
And,
uh,
they had,
you know,

1695
01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:56.530
kind of a belief system that has a variety of different tenants.
You know,

1696
01:34:56.531 --> 01:34:58.100
they believe the world is what

1697
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:02.960
<v 1>they call them.
Totay you know,
this,
this fabrication of,
of existence.</v>

1698
01:35:02.961 --> 01:35:04.790
The dream basically is what they call it.

1699
01:35:04.791 --> 01:35:08.840
And we're at constant war with what they say is the parasite and the parasite.

1700
01:35:08.841 --> 01:35:11.060
Is that Steven Pressfield's resistance.

1701
01:35:11.061 --> 01:35:14.360
It's that antagonistic force that kind of bears down on us.

1702
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:18.530
And we are warriors because we're at constant battle with the parasite,

1703
01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:22.670
with those negative forces in our mind that are telling us we're not getting off

1704
01:35:22.671 --> 01:35:26.750
telling us that we aren't worthy of self love,
that we are part of,
you know,

1705
01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:31.130
worthy of the love of creation itself.
And so that's,
that's kind of his,

1706
01:35:31.131 --> 01:35:35.300
his philosophy.
But he termed that he coined the term ruthless self love.

1707
01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:39.260
And that's not the,
that's the self love of really giving a shit about somebody,

1708
01:35:39.261 --> 01:35:41.470
you know.
So if you see someone,
it's like,
uh,

1709
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:45.250
someone who's doing something that you know,
is really fucked up for him.

1710
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:47.230
You know,
if you say,
Oh yeah,
I love that guy,
but I,

1711
01:35:47.231 --> 01:35:50.390
I wouldn't tell him that he's really,
you know,
fucking himself up with this.

1712
01:35:50.391 --> 01:35:54.200
He's got this horrible girl and it's going to drive his life into the ground or

1713
01:35:54.201 --> 01:35:57.290
horrible guy and it's going to drive her life into the ground.
You know,

1714
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:59.800
electronic balance it out there.
Yeah.
Good.
Well,
Ruth,

1715
01:36:00.090 --> 01:36:04.640
ruthless self love is saying,
you know,
listen,
I'm going to tell you,

1716
01:36:04.641 --> 01:36:08.360
I'm going to tell you what's best for you.
Regardless.
I'll love you either way,

1717
01:36:08.570 --> 01:36:12.350
but I'm going to make sure that I'm giving you the best opportunity to win.

1718
01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:15.980
And that's how we should be with ourselves.
Not Coddle ourselves and say,
oh,

1719
01:36:15.981 --> 01:36:19.220
it's okay.
You know,
it's okay that you didn't start yet.
Maybe start next Monday.

1720
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:23.690
You know,
our roof itself,
lover,
I love myself enough to fucking demand.

1721
01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:28.690
Better to say I want more for my fucking life and I'm going to make it happen.

1722
01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:31.820
And not just say,
Oh,
you know,
it's okay man.
You need to do it all right.

1723
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.120
And then meanwhile,
the other time when you fail,
it's okay,

1724
01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.450
but ruthlessly self love,
forgive yourself for their failures,

1725
01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:41.960
but demand the very best.
And that's kind of the model variety,

1726
01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:45.740
how I think we should interact with ourselves.
It would certainly give people,

1727
01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:50.510
if you have more value for yourself,
you,
you know quite more value to yourself,

1728
01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:53.570
you,
you also will value more other people as well.

1729
01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.620
It's very difficult for us to value people above our own safety and health and

1730
01:36:57.890 --> 01:37:02.420
happiness.
It's not really within our best interest to do so.
So if we,

1731
01:37:02.421 --> 01:37:05.960
if we don't value ourself,
it's easy to treat other people like shit.

1732
01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:08.230
I treat myself like shit too.
Fuck you.

1733
01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:11.990
It's like when people throw their cigarettes out the window,
why they doing that?

1734
01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:14.240
Well,
they're doing that because they treat themselves like shit.

1735
01:37:14.241 --> 01:37:16.930
Why should they give a fuck about the earth?
Watch the give,

1736
01:37:16.931 --> 01:37:18.440
give a fuck about Laurel Canyon.

1737
01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:22.160
Flicked that thing off and if it starts a fire was me,
was me.

1738
01:37:22.161 --> 01:37:25.670
They get my fucking DNA.
They're going to get your DNA from your iPhone.

1739
01:37:25.690 --> 01:37:27.890
They're gonna find out that you were responsible for a fire,

1740
01:37:27.891 --> 01:37:29.810
that they've saved the fucking original cigarette,

1741
01:37:29.811 --> 01:37:32.510
but 35 years ago and you're gonna go to jail,

1742
01:37:32.511 --> 01:37:34.880
they're going to suck your blood out and use it to power old people,

1743
01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:39.110
old people that control the Federal Bank.
I think that,
you know,

1744
01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:43.990
that that's self love thing is,
uh,

1745
01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:46.370
it's an important factor that hardly ever gets discussed.

1746
01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:48.860
But I'm glad you brought that up because it is important.
And,

1747
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:51.590
and I started default for a lot of people.
No doubt,
no doubt.

1748
01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:54.260
And I think one of the,
one of the points that he makes that,
you know,

1749
01:37:54.261 --> 01:37:56.070
I don't know how literal you want to take this,

1750
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:57.680
<v 5>but I think it's worthy of mentioning his,</v>

1751
01:37:57.681 --> 01:38:02.490
he says that a person will only tolerate the amount of abuse from somebody else

1752
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.830
at levels equal to or less than the abuse that they give themselves.
You know?

1753
01:38:07.831 --> 01:38:09.330
So basically you won't,

1754
01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:13.290
you won't stand for anybody doing anything worse to you than what you do to

1755
01:38:13.291 --> 01:38:16.470
yourself.
That's just,
Oh fuck you man.
But if you,

1756
01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:20.580
but if you're in a constant level of really demeaning and beating yourself up,

1757
01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:24.120
you will take more abuse from other people.
But if you're not,
you know,

1758
01:38:24.121 --> 01:38:27.600
not in the habit of taking any of that shit and you really love yourself when

1759
01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:31.380
someone starts being mean or conti to you,
it's like,
what the fuck are you doing?

1760
01:38:31.381 --> 01:38:34.620
Yeah.
What's up with this?
I am not going to accept this.
This is,

1761
01:38:34.710 --> 01:38:39.030
this is intolerable.
You know,
go away.
Do something else.
Fix your problems.

1762
01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:42.410
And I think that's something interesting to bear in mind is that,
you know,

1763
01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:45.840
we're so bad to ourselves that we allow other people to do that.

1764
01:38:45.841 --> 01:38:49.170
But if you set that mark to how good you treat yourself,

1765
01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:51.660
you're not going to let anybody else fucking run all over you either.

1766
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:56.060
<v 6>Yeah,
you won't.
And that's a huge problem with a lot of people.
Um,
I mean,</v>

1767
01:38:56.090 --> 01:38:59.900
we all know someone that's been in an abusive relationship and here's a real

1768
01:38:59.901 --> 01:39:01.730
gender issue that I have a problem with.
Um,

1769
01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:04.250
there's a lot of people out there that for whatever reason,

1770
01:39:04.251 --> 01:39:07.760
they don't take seriously men that are in abusive relationships with women.

1771
01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:11.150
They take seriously women in abusive relationships with men because of the

1772
01:39:11.151 --> 01:39:14.960
violence possibility.
This is violence possibility on the other side as well.

1773
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:18.710
But more importantly,
forget about the violence.
It's not like violence is like,

1774
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:23.150
you know,
oh,
it's more bad.
It's all bad abuse,
mental,
physical,

1775
01:39:23.151 --> 01:39:26.720
psychological,
uh,
monetary abuse.

1776
01:39:26.930 --> 01:39:29.870
All of the things that happened to people when they're involved in horrible

1777
01:39:29.871 --> 01:39:31.550
relationships.
They're horrible.

1778
01:39:31.670 --> 01:39:34.610
We should hate assholes that are girls and assholes that are guys,

1779
01:39:34.611 --> 01:39:36.110
we should hate assholes.
That again,

1780
01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:39.590
and assholes that are lesbian and assholes that are transgender and assholes

1781
01:39:39.591 --> 01:39:40.310
that are straight.

1782
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:44.990
We should just hate assholes or at least despise them enough to let them know

1783
01:39:44.991 --> 01:39:48.860
the error of their ways that you're fucking up this vibe,
man.
It has no,

1784
01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:53.300
it doesn't have any bearing on you having a vagina.
And this idea that you know,

1785
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:58.390
a man who's being abused is somehow or another less valuable or less worthy of

1786
01:39:59.781 --> 01:40:04.070
attention,
all abuses or this cause someone steals pencils from your office.
Well,

1787
01:40:04.071 --> 01:40:06.200
what about if someone steals pencils?

1788
01:40:06.201 --> 01:40:09.470
You see a guy come in your office and steal these pencils and just walk out and

1789
01:40:09.471 --> 01:40:11.030
uh,
you go,
hey man,
why are you stealing pencils?
Yeah,

1790
01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:13.640
what about what's going on in the Congo right now?
You have to think about that.

1791
01:40:13.641 --> 01:40:16.100
Shoot everything with a comb.
You worried about fucking stealing.

1792
01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:18.220
People are stealing minerals of the Congo.
They're getting rich.

1793
01:40:18.221 --> 01:40:20.780
These people pours.
Fuck,
give me those pencils,
bitch.

1794
01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:22.850
And that's really what it's like.
It's like,
yes,

1795
01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:26.960
there's a sliding scale of abuse and it's certainly worse when a man beats up a

1796
01:40:26.961 --> 01:40:28.670
woman.
Then when a woman yells at a man,

1797
01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:32.930
it's certainly worse cause physical dangers involved.
However,
they both suck.

1798
01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:37.040
It sucks.
It sucks to see your buddy getting yelled at by his chick.
It sucks.

1799
01:40:37.041 --> 01:40:39.460
It sucks to see somebody getting tortured in a divorce settlement.
I've

1800
01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:43.540
<v 5>seen people that basically men you know,
that have this like shock collar on him,</v>

1801
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:44.980
you know,
and the,
and the,

1802
01:40:45.250 --> 01:40:49.390
their girlfriend holds the fucking key to this shock collar and every time they

1803
01:40:49.391 --> 01:40:52.930
step out of behavior that they want or they start to get too happy or they start

1804
01:40:52.931 --> 01:40:53.260
to,

1805
01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:58.260
it's Matt like just fucking hammering down on the shot caller.

1806
01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:02.970
These kind of emotional abuse and these emotional controls saying things in

1807
01:41:02.971 --> 01:41:06.090
front of their friends.
You know,
and it's brutal to see.
I mean,

1808
01:41:06.091 --> 01:41:08.100
of course our heart,
you know,

1809
01:41:08.190 --> 01:41:11.940
bleeds more for the physical trauma that a man can do to warm cause it's just

1810
01:41:11.941 --> 01:41:15.750
purely in just,
and it's hard.
It's really hard,
you know,
for,

1811
01:41:15.751 --> 01:41:18.630
I know people like us to even hear about.

1812
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:23.040
But that other abuses is bad as well and legit wound.
It's all bad.

1813
01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:26.040
<v 6>You know,
I watched that other abuse lead to physical death.</v>

1814
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:28.860
I watched it with Phil Hartman.
I watched his wife abuse him.

1815
01:41:28.861 --> 01:41:30.690
She used to verbally abuse him in public.

1816
01:41:30.691 --> 01:41:33.870
She used to verbally mock him in public and then she wound up shooting him and

1817
01:41:33.871 --> 01:41:37.770
killing him.
So it's not like those people that are doing evil to people,

1818
01:41:37.771 --> 01:41:41.760
they can ramp that shit up.
Okay.
And all of it's bad.
Cause yes,

1819
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.120
stealing pencils is not as bad as stealing all the Colton in Africa.

1820
01:41:45.210 --> 01:41:49.110
You're right,
however it don't steal my fucking pencils.
Get your own pencils.

1821
01:41:49.111 --> 01:41:52.350
You've been a dick.
You know,
and when someone's being a dick or being a deck,

1822
01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:55.110
they're being a dick and kicking your ass.
Well then they're even more of a dick.

1823
01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:57.210
But doesn't mean the first one wasn't a dick as well.

1824
01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:00.240
It's like we've got to acknowledge that all shit behavior,

1825
01:42:00.241 --> 01:42:01.950
whether it's fucking fully ramped up,

1826
01:42:01.951 --> 01:42:05.730
escalated like Phil Hartman's wife shooting him,
or whether it's a man,
you know,

1827
01:42:05.731 --> 01:42:10.350
yelling at his fucking dog,
you know,
it's all stupid.
It's all abusive,
you know,

1828
01:42:10.351 --> 01:42:12.630
it's all dogs.
Not cutting analogy.

1829
01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:17.010
She said mother or wife or something like that.
Um,

1830
01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:19.550
but was trying to mix it up.
I,
I think we,
we,

1831
01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:24.560
we have to recognize that all of that is dependent upon the only reason why it

1832
01:42:26.611 --> 01:42:30.300
would exist that you would deny that of a man being abused is,

1833
01:42:30.301 --> 01:42:33.750
is a traumatic and horrible thing as well is either a,

1834
01:42:33.751 --> 01:42:35.580
you haven't experienced it or be a hate men.

1835
01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:39.060
I do want men to suffer for the things that other men have done.
Do you like,

1836
01:42:39.061 --> 01:42:42.840
I'm a real confused as to why it's okay for you to be sexist,
right?

1837
01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:46.440
Like why is it okay for someone to be sexist as long as they do it under the

1838
01:42:46.441 --> 01:42:50.460
guise of being feminine or a feminist?
That seems crazy.

1839
01:42:50.970 --> 01:42:54.930
Like I've actually read that men's rights groups,
it was a radical feminist blog.

1840
01:42:54.930 --> 01:42:59.190
The men's rights groups are completely unnecessary because feminism will take

1841
01:42:59.191 --> 01:43:02.100
care of all inequality if you leave it up to feminism.

1842
01:43:02.130 --> 01:43:06.480
Once feminism has been addressed and women are created equally and paid equally,

1843
01:43:06.481 --> 01:43:10.380
then we can concentrate on men and the abuse that men suffer.

1844
01:43:10.381 --> 01:43:12.300
But until that balance is achieved,

1845
01:43:12.570 --> 01:43:16.650
it's not important to concentrate on men's issues.
I was like,
that is cute.

1846
01:43:18.150 --> 01:43:19.320
That's really convenient.

1847
01:43:19.321 --> 01:43:22.590
That's a convenient piece of logic and you've got to write it down without being

1848
01:43:22.591 --> 01:43:25.050
interrupted by someone with a brain that would go,

1849
01:43:25.051 --> 01:43:26.370
what the fuck are you talking about?

1850
01:43:26.371 --> 01:43:29.880
Someone who when you write things down like in a blog form or an article that

1851
01:43:29.881 --> 01:43:32.310
you published in a magazine,
it makes you feel snooty and smart.

1852
01:43:32.730 --> 01:43:36.060
You just having an argument and you're not letting other people contribute.

1853
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:40.500
That's exactly right.
I mean it's,
it's,
that's a country way to communicate.

1854
01:43:40.501 --> 01:43:43.600
If you're talking about a person or an idea,
it really is,
you know,

1855
01:43:43.610 --> 01:43:46.230
you're writing it all down without anybody interacting.

1856
01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:49.080
It's one thing if you're having like your point on it.

1857
01:43:49.410 --> 01:43:52.340
But it's another thing when you're accusing,
everyone is concerned

1858
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:55.060
<v 0>about men who get fucked over in divorce court that they don't need to do that.</v>

1859
01:43:55.061 --> 01:43:56.450
And I need to concentrate on women's rights.

1860
01:43:56.451 --> 01:44:00.620
Cause once women have totally listen,
stop.
That's crazy.

1861
01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:05.920
Just because it's not as bad to stop on a frog as it is to stomp on a dog.

1862
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:09.900
It's still kinda fucked if someone's stomps on a frog.
You know,

1863
01:44:09.901 --> 01:44:12.380
if you see guys stomp on a frog in front of you,
he did.

1864
01:44:12.381 --> 01:44:15.530
That guy doesn't even go to jail.
Do you know that?
But if he stomps on a puppy,

1865
01:44:15.650 --> 01:44:17.540
he's going to go to jail.
Well it's this,

1866
01:44:17.541 --> 01:44:21.940
it's perpetuates analogy perpetuates the problem.
Yeah.
You know,

1867
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:23.150
I mean if you don't,

1868
01:44:23.210 --> 01:44:27.530
if you counteract something that's out of balance with something equally and

1869
01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:30.380
maybe even more crazily out of balance the other way,

1870
01:44:30.490 --> 01:44:33.020
cause you think that'll draw it back,
that's not going to work.

1871
01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:35.420
If you're successful and you're take that line,

1872
01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:38.450
it's just going to cause another reaction the other way and you're going to get

1873
01:44:38.451 --> 01:44:41.480
this fucking Hatfield Mccoy bullshit.
You know,

1874
01:44:41.481 --> 01:44:45.440
really if you just stick with what's the truth,
hey,
be good to fucking people.

1875
01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:46.940
Either way.
Don't be it,

1876
01:44:47.210 --> 01:44:52.130
don't be a misogynist Dick and don't be a crazy feminist.
Be in the middle.

1877
01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:55.910
Respect each other for what they provide and what they offer and what you know,

1878
01:44:55.911 --> 01:44:58.790
what they bring to this world and just take the middle line.

1879
01:44:58.970 --> 01:45:03.410
I think that a way more powerful way to draw things towards the center where

1880
01:45:03.411 --> 01:45:05.840
shit is cool.
That sounds like,
like rape culture to me.

1881
01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:10.340
I'm not buying a word of it or your poet.
Yeah,

1882
01:45:10.810 --> 01:45:15.050
fucking for sure man.
But also I think I admire um,
like a,

1883
01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:16.220
a lot of the uh,

1884
01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:20.390
radical feminists for one thing that I think is like really kind of cool that

1885
01:45:20.391 --> 01:45:24.620
they've done what they've done is got people to debate things that weren't even

1886
01:45:24.621 --> 01:45:28.100
an issue before.
Not In an issue,
I should say,
weren't even on the table before,

1887
01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:31.340
like drinking and having sex with someone being raped.

1888
01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:35.930
Like they'd taken this crazy hard stance that anybody's had any sort of alcohol

1889
01:45:35.931 --> 01:45:39.710
in them.
If you have sex with them,
it's rape including men.

1890
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:42.500
Cause they have to do it that way.
You have to cover your basis.
You can't,

1891
01:45:42.501 --> 01:45:45.020
you can't have a double standard in that sense.
So they're saying women,

1892
01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:47.780
if you know your man has had something to drink,
do not have sex with them.

1893
01:45:47.781 --> 01:45:51.710
Cause if you do,
he cannot consent.
So that's rape.
It's absolutely fascinating.

1894
01:45:51.711 --> 01:45:54.350
Men have an automatic control for that.
You're drinking enough whiskey.

1895
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:59.170
You can't have sex unless you're like one of the crazy fucking candy flip and

1896
01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:02.930
dude's takes by Agora and drinks.
When I was dudes just like slug caught,
hell,

1897
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:07.790
I'm here for um,
if you,
uh,
if you think about that though,

1898
01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:10.310
I mean,
look,
look what they're saying there.
I mean,
look with,
uh,

1899
01:46:12.050 --> 01:46:15.230
you're saying that everybody who has sex with someone who's drinking is a
rapist.

1900
01:46:15.231 --> 01:46:18.350
That's crazy.
I think the whole world's a rapist.
If that's,
if that's the case,

1901
01:46:18.351 --> 01:46:21.950
that's a criteria.
But what's important is,
look,

1902
01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:25.580
I don't agree with them on that standard obviously,
but I think what support is,

1903
01:46:25.581 --> 01:46:27.860
they got the debate out.
All of a sudden people are talking about,

1904
01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:30.200
I'm talking about it.
I wasn't talking about it before,

1905
01:46:30.201 --> 01:46:32.060
but I shouldn't be talking about it cause it's fucked.

1906
01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:34.880
When you read about some story like that story in Ohio where these kids got this

1907
01:46:34.881 --> 01:46:37.700
girl drunk and passed around,
it's fucking horrific.

1908
01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:42.710
That's dehumanizing of a human.
Absolutely.
It makes you sick.

1909
01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:45.890
It makes you feel terrible.
Doping people,

1910
01:46:45.891 --> 01:46:49.350
drugging people or taking advantage of someone who's personally done it

1911
01:46:49.351 --> 01:46:50.184
themselves with it's,

1912
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:52.380
<v 6>they've made a bad decision and they've took a drug.</v>

1913
01:46:52.381 --> 01:46:57.120
It doesn't mean you could fuck them like that's crazy and that that's now being

1914
01:46:57.121 --> 01:46:58.980
talked about more.
I'm talking about it more.

1915
01:46:58.981 --> 01:47:00.000
I've heard people talk about it more.

1916
01:47:00.001 --> 01:47:03.840
I've read people debate it and argue it in in very strange ways,

1917
01:47:03.841 --> 01:47:07.290
but what I haven't heard is the one thing that I think is the most genius aspect

1918
01:47:07.291 --> 01:47:09.600
of the whole debate and said they made it a discussion.

1919
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:11.280
Now people are forced to talk about it.

1920
01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:15.130
Now people were forced to debate the broad spectrum that we have of,

1921
01:47:15.131 --> 01:47:17.070
of intoxication,

1922
01:47:17.370 --> 01:47:22.260
whether it's barely tipsy to uh,
feeling good too.
Oh Shit.

1923
01:47:22.261 --> 01:47:25.950
I shouldn't drive to.
I'm gonna I'm gonna throw up too.
You know,
too.

1924
01:47:25.951 --> 01:47:26.640
I'm blacked out.

1925
01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:30.720
There's like a lot of shit going on in there and sometimes it's okay to fuck
you.

1926
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:33.690
Some of those it's okay to fuck.
You know,

1927
01:47:33.691 --> 01:47:37.860
some of them it's okay to fuck it if you're like talking crazy and you know,

1928
01:47:37.861 --> 01:47:41.910
you could barely say your words.
No,
you can't fuck.
Yup.
Okay.

1929
01:47:41.911 --> 01:47:43.500
So it's like we've got to figure out what's rape.

1930
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:47.670
We've got to figure out what it is.
Is it one drink?
No,
it's not one drink.

1931
01:47:47.850 --> 01:47:50.940
Two drinks.
No.
Is it three drinks?
It's getting a little rapey.

1932
01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:54.240
Three drinks gets a little rapey right.
For drinks.
Ooh.

1933
01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:58.740
That's kind of rapey like how drunk,
how much do you weigh?
[inaudible] 98 mm.

1934
01:47:59.040 --> 01:47:59.910
Well,
how much did you drink?

1935
01:48:00.220 --> 01:48:03.160
<v 5>The problem I have with this,
this whole line of thinking though,</v>

1936
01:48:03.161 --> 01:48:08.161
is it's taking sex that can be consensual and fun as this has to be a predatory

1937
01:48:09.611 --> 01:48:11.140
act.
Yes.
You know what I mean?

1938
01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:13.510
<v 6>It can be just sex.
Not only that,</v>

1939
01:48:13.511 --> 01:48:18.010
they want you to maintain the same state that you were when you were wanting

1940
01:48:18.011 --> 01:48:20.410
that sex after the sex is over,

1941
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:24.910
or you somehow or another of con them into having sex by pretending that that

1942
01:48:24.911 --> 01:48:27.760
state was going to stay there because that's the state that you were at when we

1943
01:48:27.761 --> 01:48:31.310
were trying to get sex from them.
Like if you're just calm and pass like God,

1944
01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:33.400
you're so different when we're out.

1945
01:48:33.401 --> 01:48:37.870
You're kissing me and holding my hand and stroking my hair and now you just want

1946
01:48:37.871 --> 01:48:42.760
to talk like I'm your buddy.
God.
You're just so take me for granted.

1947
01:48:43.090 --> 01:48:46.300
Like,
oh my God,
do I have to maintain the same state all the time?

1948
01:48:46.301 --> 01:48:48.850
Like if you don't maintain the same state that you're in when you're looking for

1949
01:48:48.851 --> 01:48:53.380
sex somehow,
no.
You're a bad person.
Somehow know the possible Jesus Christ.

1950
01:48:53.381 --> 01:48:54.200
We're crazy.

1951
01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:57.590
<v 5>Yeah.
You,
you take all these things,
it just boils down to the same thing.</v>

1952
01:48:57.620 --> 01:48:59.780
Don't disrespect someone's,

1953
01:48:59.870 --> 01:49:03.330
<v 6>don't hang out with cats either.
When someone treats you like that.
Yeah,</v>

1954
01:49:03.331 --> 01:49:06.380
you didn't even,
you didn't even treat me like I'm,
she'd be like,

1955
01:49:06.381 --> 01:49:09.840
a prince says to you,
I should be like a queen.
I should be.

1956
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:11.690
He didn't treat her like your queen.

1957
01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:18.110
<v 5>There's so many.
You know,
I think the,
I think actually,
uh,</v>

1958
01:49:18.170 --> 01:49:21.260
Chris Ryan has a chapter in his book,
says everybody out of the closet.

1959
01:49:21.261 --> 01:49:26.261
And basically his point is that we're all spent so much time lying to each other

1960
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:30.650
about what we actually feel,
what's actually going on.
You know?
And it's just,

1961
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:34.400
it's just silly.
If we could just be a 100% fully open,

1962
01:49:34.610 --> 01:49:36.320
even if you don't act on it,
you know,

1963
01:49:36.321 --> 01:49:39.080
I'm not saying everybody go out and be polyamorous and do this,

1964
01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:43.220
but at least acknowledge the feelings that you're going through of where,

1965
01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:48.340
you know,
if you're done having sex with your woman and was fantasizing

1966
01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:51.880
<v 0>about somebody else,
okay.
That shit happens.
No,
no,
no.
It does not happen.</v>

1967
01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:55.240
I don't know what you're talking about,
but you're,
you know,

1968
01:49:55.241 --> 01:49:58.660
and if a beautiful girl walks by and you notice that's going to fucking happen

1969
01:49:58.661 --> 01:50:03.040
too.
We're fucking monkeys that likes sex.
We have huge testicles,

1970
01:50:03.130 --> 01:50:07.770
not like mine and normal line of fine.
You know,
just thinking about them,

1971
01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:09.790
what's going on and quit the lying.

1972
01:50:09.791 --> 01:50:14.200
And at least at that point you can make fair assessments and not get all

1973
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:18.100
offended by all this nonsense.
Think Duck Dynasty guy should cut his beard.

1974
01:50:18.101 --> 01:50:21.340
Is that what we're trying to say?
Is that,
that's what I heard.

1975
01:50:21.670 --> 01:50:23.980
What I heard is you're hiding behind that beard,
sir.

1976
01:50:24.010 --> 01:50:27.070
That beard is covering your need to stuff a cock in your mouth.

1977
01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:28.060
You're trying to make your,

1978
01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:32.440
your faces unattractive and central as possible by having all this hair grow off

1979
01:50:32.441 --> 01:50:35.020
of it.
Just to discourage the guy from fucking your face.

1980
01:50:35.290 --> 01:50:38.620
Because what really does want to be out there with ducks?

1981
01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:43.190
He just knows that the ducks,
usually it's only men out there.
You know,

1982
01:50:44.410 --> 01:50:46.120
if you're a gay guy,
duck hunting.
If you're gay,

1983
01:50:46.121 --> 01:50:50.170
guy would be like going shopping with girls that are really hot.
You know,
look,

1984
01:50:50.171 --> 01:50:52.090
you hang around with a bunch of fucking manly men.

1985
01:50:52.091 --> 01:50:55.840
You were in a hut in the middle of the swamp out of no where.
No one's around.

1986
01:50:55.841 --> 01:51:00.740
No one's going to know.
Come on man.
I'm hard.
Your heart.
That's what it's like.

1987
01:51:00.741 --> 01:51:01.090
He's like,

1988
01:51:01.090 --> 01:51:03.940
if you're hanging around with a bunch of really hot girls and they want to take

1989
01:51:03.941 --> 01:51:07.210
you shopping and cuddle,
let's watch TV together.
Okay,

1990
01:51:07.330 --> 01:51:10.180
so you're all cuddling in front of TV or are you cuddling in front of the

1991
01:51:10.181 --> 01:51:14.310
fucking,
the ducks,
the duck decoys.
Same Goddamn Shit for warmth.

1992
01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:16.230
If you had a bunch of really hot girlfriends,

1993
01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:18.520
they were all your friends and they're really hot and they wanted to watch TV

1994
01:51:18.521 --> 01:51:21.450
with you and they wanted you to just sit in with them and you all,
you know,

1995
01:51:21.470 --> 01:51:24.250
you'd pretend you liked fucking general hospital man.

1996
01:51:25.150 --> 01:51:26.470
Especially if you didn't get any posting.

1997
01:51:26.650 --> 01:51:30.250
I feel like some poor repressed gay guy that just really wants to soccer cock

1998
01:51:30.251 --> 01:51:34.090
but can't quite commit to it,
just fucking deal with the reality of his desires.

1999
01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:34.821
So what does he do?

2000
01:51:34.821 --> 01:51:38.170
It grows it's crazy beard and he gets in that hut with all these guys and just

2001
01:51:38.171 --> 01:51:39.880
goes,
I just want to fuck everyone in this hot.

2002
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:44.270
I just want to stick mine one of the miles wanting to ask and just fuck.

2003
01:51:44.271 --> 01:51:46.240
I'm back and forth.
But no,

2004
01:51:46.241 --> 01:51:49.940
I'm just going to evil site and coming out of my mouth and my asshole.

2005
01:51:50.590 --> 01:51:53.740
Never Shave your balls and grow your fucking face hair too.

2006
01:51:53.741 --> 01:51:56.290
It looks like Rumpelstiltskin.
That's what's going on man.

2007
01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:59.770
That very well could be since he became what's going on,
man.

2008
01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:03.070
It's just like you and uh oh they're my friends.
But you know,

2009
01:52:03.071 --> 01:52:04.090
we just watched TV together.

2010
01:52:04.091 --> 01:52:08.560
We cuddle and they put a leg over your leg and you know it's fucking cold in

2011
01:52:08.561 --> 01:52:08.981
that place.

2012
01:52:08.981 --> 01:52:13.080
You got to cuddle the stay warm just like it's called in the duck blind bunch a

2013
01:52:13.090 --> 01:52:16.030
man.
You're barely even touching each other cause you're wearing down and shit.

2014
01:52:16.031 --> 01:52:18.970
It's like,
man,
this down.
It feels really good on my cock.
Does it?

2015
01:52:19.450 --> 01:52:20.171
What does it feel like?

2016
01:52:20.171 --> 01:52:22.030
Can you feel it when someone touches your cock on the downswing?

2017
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:25.570
I don't know man.
I don't mean old think so all you would,
if I grabbed it,

2018
01:52:25.571 --> 01:52:29.860
pure bred or would let me,
let me just see if you could feel it.
Let's try it.

2019
01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:34.030
Let's just try it for,
I'll grab you.
Cocktail me if you feel it.
Not sure.

2020
01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:39.200
Do you feel now grab a little harder.
Know it.
Sure.
Do you feel now Condo,

2021
01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:41.950
I don't know.
Maybe while you weren't too many layers,

2022
01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:43.210
what's underneath this layer?

2023
01:52:43.450 --> 01:52:45.100
Do you get how many layers you got out at four or five?

2024
01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:47.570
Do you think the lower layers are just as strong?
Only one.

2025
01:52:47.571 --> 01:52:52.070
And to tell the next thing is these guys suck and your cock in the middle of a

2026
01:52:52.071 --> 01:52:56.070
fucking duck blind.
The other guy that tried to ignore it,
to call it duck,

2027
01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:58.400
some of them someone please animate this city,

2028
01:52:59.870 --> 01:53:02.610
caused it and send it in please.
And you got this,

2029
01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:07.660
you got the script all set out and over time that beard morphs into a handle pro

2030
01:53:08.170 --> 01:53:11.110
and snack ducks.
What they expect to get them out fucked.

2031
01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:14.030
What they do is they'll lie down on their back so they lead their head off the

2032
01:53:14.031 --> 01:53:17.390
edge of the bed he ever see like a Sasha grey porn when she gets throat fucked,

2033
01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:21.710
guy gets it.
Never gets that topic.
Just unbelievable.

2034
01:53:21.711 --> 01:53:24.860
Fucking physics involved here.
I don't know where the deck is disappearing,

2035
01:53:24.861 --> 01:53:27.830
but it's like fucking,
it's like going to see a what?
What's his name?

2036
01:53:27.831 --> 01:53:30.830
David Copperfield and Vega or Lance Armstrong.
Is that the other one?

2037
01:53:30.831 --> 01:53:34.550
Know that she's the fucking cracker angel.
Who's the the last one isn't there?

2038
01:53:35.010 --> 01:53:38.660
Chris Burton.
Lance Burton.
That's the guy.
Not Armstrong.
Whatever,

2039
01:53:38.661 --> 01:53:41.030
but that's what that beard is.
Science Burton made one of his testicles.

2040
01:53:41.110 --> 01:53:43.370
I mean Lance Armstrong made one of his testicles disappear.

2041
01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:46.040
They ramped up good around the wrist so they can get wheel.

2042
01:53:46.041 --> 01:53:48.550
Good grip on her face.
She just slug done phase.

2043
01:53:48.650 --> 01:53:51.020
That's why it's the only one reason to have a beard like that.

2044
01:53:51.050 --> 01:53:53.970
It's like getting your hair pulled.
So same thing.
Why?

2045
01:53:53.971 --> 01:53:55.490
Why do girls like long hair?
I Dunno,

2046
01:53:55.820 --> 01:53:58.820
but some girls like to get their hair parole fact they don't like it.

2047
01:53:58.830 --> 01:54:00.770
The end don't pull on the end.
You could break that.
It's really,

2048
01:54:00.860 --> 01:54:04.310
they want a handful and the back of the head.
Not too hard unless they're crazy.

2049
01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:06.110
And if they are only do it once and then get out of there.

2050
01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:09.380
Do you want to do to grow?
That's what's going on with that beard.

2051
01:54:09.381 --> 01:54:12.840
He just wants you to wrap your fucking restaurant on that pitch and gap Gooding

2052
01:54:12.870 --> 01:54:16.100
and I watch duck dynasty.
I never even thought of the large sack of potatoes.

2053
01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:19.160
Like if you had to carry a large sack of potatoes by the very top handle,

2054
01:54:19.161 --> 01:54:21.530
you'd have to get very good grip on it because it,
you know,

2055
01:54:21.770 --> 01:54:24.980
the logical way would do get underneath that 40 pound sack of potatoes.

2056
01:54:24.981 --> 01:54:26.300
But if you're going to carry it by the top,

2057
01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:28.160
you're going to have a fucking Kung Fu grip.

2058
01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:32.560
And I'm saying you got to grab that Shit.
That's what that beard,
the wraparound.

2059
01:54:35.330 --> 01:54:36.163
Right.

2060
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:42.230
And that's what you get for spewing a bunch of homophobic nonsense,

2061
01:54:42.710 --> 01:54:45.950
talking about assholes out of nowhere.
That's what's hilarious.
I mean,

2062
01:54:45.980 --> 01:54:48.470
weren't they talking about like ducks duck calls?

2063
01:54:48.471 --> 01:54:50.930
Are you going to duck show and all of a sudden it's like the problem is man's

2064
01:54:50.931 --> 01:54:54.920
ass holes.
People are choosing that over a girl.
Come on guys.
That was my case.

2065
01:54:54.921 --> 01:54:58.700
Sam,
what are you looking at there?
Come on.
Why are you choosing that butthole?

2066
01:54:58.730 --> 01:55:01.430
What's that all about?
What is that all about?

2067
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:03.410
Why are you talking about men's butts,
man?

2068
01:55:03.770 --> 01:55:06.020
Why are you worrying about dudes making choices?

2069
01:55:06.021 --> 01:55:09.800
Do you get angry when someone orders a fucking espresso?
I think it tastes gross.

2070
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:13.730
I hate espresso.
Come on guys,
have a cup of tea.

2071
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:18.670
Come on guys.
How about you?
Who?
Come on guys.
There's something there.
You're,

2072
01:55:18.690 --> 01:55:20.270
you're getting upset about someone's choices.

2073
01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:25.300
We're the only species that drum aggressively tries to limit each other's

2074
01:55:25.341 --> 01:55:28.100
pleasure constantly,
constantly.
You know,

2075
01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:31.970
like whatever makes the person happy.
We decide all that's okay,

2076
01:55:31.971 --> 01:55:33.800
but this isn't okay.
What the fuck?

2077
01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:36.890
If that makes that person happy and it's not hurting anybody.

2078
01:55:37.070 --> 01:55:39.800
Let's just draw one fucking line,
do whatever you want.

2079
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:44.010
As long as it doesn't hurt anybody or communally hurt by hurting the

2080
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:48.120
<v 5>environment.
You know,
that's it.
That's the fucking line hurt.
You know,</v>

2081
01:55:48.121 --> 01:55:49.860
don't hurt the earth and its creatures,

2082
01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:52.560
but do whatever the fuck else you want to do that makes you happy.

2083
01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:55.150
<v 6>We've got problems,
Aubrey.
There's the Yin and the Yang.
Again,</v>

2084
01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:59.680
you have to have this fucking horrible sense of being restricted in order to

2085
01:55:59.681 --> 01:56:03.370
really appreciate the freedom.
It's a trip.
The whole thing is a trip.

2086
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:06.490
We're sleeping right now,
dude.
We're attached baby by wires.

2087
01:56:06.491 --> 01:56:10.030
Most likely buy nano fibers that we can't even see.

2088
01:56:10.100 --> 01:56:14.730
Probably like some subatomic particles locked in somewhere in some strange dance

2089
01:56:15.070 --> 01:56:18.910
tunes us into this bizarre dimension and we like to think of as reality and we

2090
01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:22.870
knock on things and spill coffee on your laptop and it's gotta be real.

2091
01:56:22.871 --> 01:56:26.470
I had to go to the apple store.
They told me my hard drive was cook taught.

2092
01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:30.430
It's not real stupid.
There is no real,
that's the thing.

2093
01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:33.370
Nothing's real cause there is no real and if nothing's real,

2094
01:56:33.550 --> 01:56:38.550
if you realize that at the root of all reality is Adams and Adams are like

2095
01:56:39.041 --> 01:56:42.100
mostly bullshit.
Adam's like a big air balloon.

2096
01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:45.470
It's like a big helium balloon of bullshit.
Like there's,

2097
01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:48.070
there's a lot of space in there where there's nothing in there.

2098
01:56:48.071 --> 01:56:49.210
And then you go deep,
deep,
deep,

2099
01:56:49.211 --> 01:56:52.660
and then the shits like moving around and disappearing and reappearing and

2100
01:56:52.930 --> 01:56:54.520
existing in the same state,

2101
01:56:54.521 --> 01:56:58.750
spinning and still at the same time blinking in and out of existence,

2102
01:56:58.990 --> 01:57:03.990
being able to link up and somehow or another communicate with other atoms Tanium

2103
01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:08.830
all across the planet.
Like what is that?
That's magic.

2104
01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:13.280
That's craziness.
That's fantasy.
And that's reality.
That is that,

2105
01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:17.590
is that 100% sure.
Yes.
We,
we know what it is.
Okay.
So we're,

2106
01:57:17.591 --> 01:57:20.860
we are living in a dream.
We launder.
Percent are,

2107
01:57:21.010 --> 01:57:23.380
even if there's rules to this dream,
even if,
yeah,

2108
01:57:23.381 --> 01:57:25.390
you got to hit your brakes or you will hit the car in front of you,

2109
01:57:25.570 --> 01:57:29.260
it's still a fucking dream,
man.
Look at the subatomic particles.

2110
01:57:29.261 --> 01:57:33.010
Look at the lowest,
the smallest thing that we can observe,

2111
01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:37.000
the smallest thing that we could observe about this universe.
It's fucking magic.

2112
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:40.210
The smallest thing disappears.
Reappears,

2113
01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:44.020
spins and stay still and is there and it's gone.
We don't know where it went.

2114
01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:45.380
Fuck.

2115
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:47.670
<v 5>Well,
what?
The quantum entanglement things,</v>

2116
01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:51.620
something that nobody takes far enough.
You have these two linked photons,

2117
01:57:51.650 --> 01:57:55.100
one of them spinning one way.
You take it all the way across the world.

2118
01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:57.680
You could presumably take it all the way across the universe.

2119
01:57:57.950 --> 01:58:01.310
You do something to manipulate the way this one spins in the other

2120
01:58:01.311 --> 01:58:05.360
instantaneously spins that way as well.
Well,
what the fuck does that mean?

2121
01:58:05.361 --> 01:58:07.250
How does it happen?
It's not just an anomaly.

2122
01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:12.370
The only way that I can possibly explain that is that there is some other

2123
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:18.110
mechanism of communication that doesn't have to follow these Newtonian laws of

2124
01:58:18.111 --> 01:58:21.080
sending some kind of signal by light or whatever.

2125
01:58:21.110 --> 01:58:22.490
There's another fucking dimension.

2126
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:27.140
You know there's something else out there that is not explainable by what we

2127
01:58:27.141 --> 01:58:29.530
think is science.
Yeah.

2128
01:58:29.670 --> 01:58:31.290
<v 6>As long as the science is correct.</v>

2129
01:58:31.291 --> 01:58:33.470
And I assume it is because I haven't heard it criticized.

2130
01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:38.160
It's not like it's under debate.
So those are the guys who understand it.
Agree.

2131
01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:41.110
At least for the most part I should.
I'm sure there's probably a few that don't.

2132
01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:43.300
I haven't heard anything.
I don't know.
I don't,
I haven't heard it either,

2133
01:58:43.301 --> 01:58:45.310
but I just want to hedge my bets,
I'm sure.

2134
01:58:45.340 --> 01:58:47.740
But the bottom line is you and I don't even understand what the fuck they're

2135
01:58:47.741 --> 01:58:48.520
saying,

2136
01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:52.030
but the people who do understand it are pretty much had a consensus that this is

2137
01:58:52.031 --> 01:58:55.060
actually going on and,
and they just put it in a drawer.
Okay.

2138
01:58:55.090 --> 01:58:59.630
That's quantum entanglement.
Good.
Ooh,
why?
How's that?
Yeah.

2139
01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:03.950
It happens faster than the speed of light and it violates everything.

2140
01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:08.140
So if that's the case,
if that is the case and it appears to be,
so what is,

2141
01:59:08.141 --> 01:59:11.170
what is going on here?
What is really going on here?
I hate what is going on here.

2142
01:59:11.530 --> 01:59:13.240
What is this thing?
You know,
Deepak Chopra,

2143
01:59:13.241 --> 01:59:17.530
who I think for the most part is a guy who means,
well,
I really do believe that.

2144
01:59:17.590 --> 01:59:20.410
I think when I see him talk and I see these,

2145
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:23.650
these speeches that he gives when he gets clouded by actual scientists,

2146
01:59:23.651 --> 01:59:26.620
especially over the use of the word quantum and things along those lines,
right.

2147
01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:28.780
I think he,
at the very least,

2148
01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:33.960
he projects a much more positive view of the possibilities of living life.

2149
01:59:34.630 --> 01:59:37.600
Then a lot of people do,
you know,
maybe his jargon is incorrect.

2150
01:59:37.601 --> 01:59:40.720
Sometimes we talks about quantum this and quantum that and maybe some of the

2151
01:59:40.721 --> 01:59:44.260
stuff that he says like Kara Santa Maria who's awesome and very smart.

2152
01:59:44.261 --> 01:59:46.960
She said she,
she doesn't like him just because he's a Wu peddler.

2153
01:59:47.470 --> 01:59:51.330
She called him a Wu peddler.
I fucking love that.
Oop.

2154
01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:52.840
Had little cause that's what it is.
Like he'll,

2155
01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:56.460
he'll start talking about the quantum and you know,
the,
the spirit and the,

2156
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:58.570
you know,
he'll start talking about he'll,

2157
01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:02.680
he'll sell you on a bunch of shit that maybe he doesn't really understand

2158
02:00:02.681 --> 02:00:03.910
himself,
you know,

2159
02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:08.590
but it least what he's saying is being fairly positive.

2160
02:00:08.650 --> 02:00:11.710
And this is one of the things he talked about in this debate with Richard

2161
02:00:11.710 --> 02:00:13.960
Dawkins and Dawkins,
just like,
you know,

2162
02:00:13.961 --> 02:00:18.310
Dawkins seems to be like a brilliant guy that's tired of dummies and he can't a

2163
02:00:18.311 --> 02:00:19.420
little cunty in his old age,

2164
02:00:19.421 --> 02:00:23.070
he likes to yell at people and call people are ridiculous.
And he would say,

2165
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:26.690
Depok quoted someone,
I don't know if he's wrong or right,
but,
uh,

2166
02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:30.190
Dawkins said he should sue you.
He should sue you for that quote.

2167
02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:32.860
He should sue you.
I mean,

2168
02:00:32.861 --> 02:00:35.980
this is like where you're talking about the existence of God and the spiritual

2169
02:00:35.981 --> 02:00:38.380
realm and all these different things that are debating and he's like,

2170
02:00:38.381 --> 02:00:40.210
you should sue you.
Really.

2171
02:00:40.330 --> 02:00:42.220
Do you think someone should have to go to court for that,

2172
02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:46.540
for misrepresenting something so silly?
I don't even remember what it was,

2173
02:00:46.541 --> 02:00:48.120
but it was some,
some quantum FAQ.

2174
02:00:49.330 --> 02:00:53.650
People love pretty pitting these polar opposites up against each other,
you know,

2175
02:00:53.651 --> 02:00:54.221
because,

2176
02:00:54.221 --> 02:00:58.240
and then they both battle it out and really they're both right about half the

2177
02:00:58.241 --> 02:01:02.200
shit talking about doctors need to do drugs.
He just does.
He,
you know,

2178
02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:03.580
he always talks about,
you know,

2179
02:01:03.670 --> 02:01:08.260
perhaps I would do psychedelics in a controlled environment.
Maybe LSD.

2180
02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:13.120
He's such a brilliant guy,
but if he did one mushroom trip,
one Iowasca trip,

2181
02:01:13.121 --> 02:01:17.720
just one pot Brownie and getting an isolation tank,
he would realize like,
Oh man,

2182
02:01:17.770 --> 02:01:22.590
I could just relax here.
Holy Jesus Christ.
Let me just sit back here.
Okay.

2183
02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:25.330
There's more people on my side that,
okay,
okay.
I mean,
I'm very defensive.

2184
02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:28.750
Let me just sit down.
Depok over.
Fancy to talk about is I will ask a trip.

2185
02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:32.950
I could have Depok on the podcast and talk to them and not get angry at him even

2186
02:01:32.951 --> 02:01:37.150
though I think sometimes he's silly.
You know,
sometimes I think you silly,

2187
02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:40.760
I think,
but I think he's,
he's not silly evil.
He's not silly.

2188
02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:43.310
Donald Trump where he wants to fucking credit for everything.

2189
02:01:43.311 --> 02:01:46.310
I created this fucking,
and he's not that.
He knows that kind of silly.

2190
02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:49.880
He's not dot dominator silly to different kinds of silly,
it's like a silly,

2191
02:01:49.881 --> 02:01:52.670
where he's trying to,
he's not the same guy he was a year ago either.

2192
02:01:52.671 --> 02:01:55.670
He's not the same guy he was 10 years ago.
Yeah.
It applies to him as well.

2193
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:59.250
Even though he's public.
He's a work in progress like all of us.
Okay.

2194
02:01:59.550 --> 02:02:04.480
<v 5>Yeah.
I mean your criticism is maybe he lost that realization that hey,</v>

2195
02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:06.050
maybe I really don't know.
You know,

2196
02:02:06.110 --> 02:02:09.530
maybe he's lost a little of that humility of saying,
I don't really know,

2197
02:02:09.531 --> 02:02:12.230
but I think this might be a way,
and at least if it's not,

2198
02:02:12.410 --> 02:02:16.550
it's a good way to think about it that will help you lead a better life.
I think.

2199
02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:19.250
Um,
William James was one of the,

2200
02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:24.220
one of the guys who really did a good job of that saying basically,
you know,

2201
02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:27.920
if I may be right about this way of thinking,

2202
02:02:27.950 --> 02:02:32.150
but even if I'm not thinking this way,
allows me to lead a better life.

2203
02:02:32.151 --> 02:02:36.800
And I think he was talking about um,
will and he was basically saying,

2204
02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:37.460
look,

2205
02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:41.360
I don't know if we have freewill or I don't know if everything we do is based on

2206
02:02:41.361 --> 02:02:44.030
a causal chain of events that we really can't control.

2207
02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:49.420
But thinking about freewill in a way that it does exist allows me to live a

2208
02:02:50.001 --> 02:02:51.830
better life.
And so guess what,

2209
02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:56.630
I am a proponent of free will because that allows me to live a better life that

2210
02:02:56.631 --> 02:03:00.590
way.
Cause I feel like I have more flexibility,
more choice.
I'm a happier person.

2211
02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:04.000
And I think sometimes people forget some of that too.
You know?

2212
02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:06.890
I mean there's something to be said for thinking about things.

2213
02:03:06.891 --> 02:03:09.350
Even if you don't know,
you know,
think about things in a,

2214
02:03:09.351 --> 02:03:13.280
in a way that's gonna allow you to lead the best life and you know,

2215
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:15.650
way better than if you don't know anyways,

2216
02:03:15.710 --> 02:03:17.810
you think about something in a way that fucking sucks.

2217
02:03:17.811 --> 02:03:19.760
Like I'm going to go to hell for sure.

2218
02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:24.890
Well if you're wrong in that you've lived a life being afraid and being worried

2219
02:03:24.891 --> 02:03:29.570
about shit,
man,
you are wrong.
Might as well think in a positive way.
And still,

2220
02:03:29.571 --> 02:03:31.430
you still may turn out to be wrong,
but hey,

2221
02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:33.230
along the way you lived in a better way.

2222
02:03:33.700 --> 02:03:36.340
<v 6>Yeah.
It sounds like someone is starting a cult.
That's what I just heard.</v>

2223
02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:40.780
I heard Aubrey's.
Yeah.
No,
no doubt man.
I mean there's a,

2224
02:03:40.890 --> 02:03:44.110
I think it couldn't,
it might not be either or as well.

2225
02:03:44.111 --> 02:03:47.810
It might be another one of those situations.
Yeah.
You know,
it,
uh,

2226
02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:51.130
there's,
I think there's a lot of things going on.

2227
02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:53.500
There's a lot of things going on in this life and um,

2228
02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:56.020
I think we should acknowledge all of them.
You know,

2229
02:03:56.021 --> 02:03:59.290
we should acknowledge the most importantly,
the mystery of it all.

2230
02:03:59.350 --> 02:04:02.440
That's one of the big things that drives me crazy about someone when they say,

2231
02:04:02.710 --> 02:04:05.470
you know,
that this is this and that is that in the,
you know,

2232
02:04:05.471 --> 02:04:08.470
the way you should live is this,
and the way the government should do is that,

2233
02:04:08.471 --> 02:04:13.240
and the way we're going to solve this is by that.
Like maybe,
maybe not,
maybe not.

2234
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.780
Like are you,

2235
02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:16.600
are you really so sure that you're paying attention to what the fuck is going
on?

2236
02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:19.980
We're flying through space like we're in a space ship.

2237
02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:21.730
If the spaceship was a hundred feet wide,

2238
02:04:21.731 --> 02:04:23.530
you'd be freaking the fuck out right now.

2239
02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:25.090
The only reason why you're not freaking out,

2240
02:04:25.091 --> 02:04:28.510
it's because it's like thousands of miles wide,
but it's still a space ship.

2241
02:04:28.570 --> 02:04:31.990
You're on this spinning fucking thing and at nighttime you could see the space

2242
02:04:31.991 --> 02:04:35.320
you're flying through and you're spinning a thousand miles an hour in a circle

2243
02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:40.230
and your hose floating this giant nuclear explosion and that's around other

2244
02:04:40.290 --> 02:04:45.290
bigger rocks that are flying behind you and gas giants and then other galaxies

2245
02:04:45.841 --> 02:04:50.370
and other universes and on and on and on and you just hurdling through it while

2246
02:04:50.371 --> 02:04:53.430
you're worried about what's on TV and why the walking dead is so many

2247
02:04:53.431 --> 02:04:56.310
commercials and why gas is $4

2248
02:04:57.040 --> 02:04:59.850
<v 1>if you imagine,
if this was,
let's say,</v>

2249
02:04:59.970 --> 02:05:03.660
put yourself in a position where this really was a dream and you had a lucid

2250
02:05:03.661 --> 02:05:05.130
dream where you're aware,
you know,

2251
02:05:05.370 --> 02:05:07.320
is that what you would want to do with your dream?

2252
02:05:07.321 --> 02:05:10.830
If you're going to sleep at night and you were saying you would worry about all

2253
02:05:10.831 --> 02:05:13.680
of these inane things,
never actually be in the present moment,

2254
02:05:13.681 --> 02:05:17.940
never taken adventure,
never go on a risk,
never love because you could get hurt.

2255
02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:21.330
No.
If you,
if this,
if you really did treat this like a dream,

2256
02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:24.990
you would do as much cool shit as possible.
You know,
put his,

2257
02:05:24.991 --> 02:05:29.850
put as many good things into that dream as you possibly could and not not be so

2258
02:05:29.851 --> 02:05:33.230
fucking stressed out about all this nonsense.
You know?
And,

2259
02:05:33.231 --> 02:05:37.020
and I think we've been talking a lot,
it's kinda been the theme of this podcast,

2260
02:05:37.021 --> 02:05:40.770
but if you actually did,
if this was a lucid dream,
you know,

2261
02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:42.570
you would live it in a different way.

2262
02:05:42.570 --> 02:05:44.610
You would live it to have some fun and enjoy it.

2263
02:05:44.820 --> 02:05:49.140
What can I fly all my lucid dreams?
I want to fly or breathe under water.

2264
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:52.500
Breathing underwater is cool too.
That's a good one.
Yeah,

2265
02:05:52.530 --> 02:05:56.370
it would be very strange if one day it was proven that we are really living in

2266
02:05:56.371 --> 02:05:58.020
some sort of self created reality.

2267
02:05:58.350 --> 02:06:01.890
It would be like a really traumatizing for a lot of people that have fucked it

2268
02:06:01.891 --> 02:06:04.260
up.
He'd be like,
this is what I made.
But it's like,

2269
02:06:04.261 --> 02:06:07.170
remember when you were in school and like there was a project and you had to use

2270
02:06:07.171 --> 02:06:11.010
your hand and make a Turkey and you put your hand down and you drew around and

2271
02:06:11.011 --> 02:06:11.581
then you know,

2272
02:06:11.581 --> 02:06:14.430
everybody did their own little Turkey painted it and then the teacher would put

2273
02:06:14.431 --> 02:06:15.900
them up in there and I'll look at them and some people's,

2274
02:06:15.901 --> 02:06:18.060
Turkey's looked like dog shit.
I looked,

2275
02:06:18.061 --> 02:06:19.830
I didn't know what the fuck a Turkey looked like.

2276
02:06:19.950 --> 02:06:21.960
They didn't even know how to draw around their hand.

2277
02:06:21.961 --> 02:06:23.370
Like everything was a disaster.

2278
02:06:23.610 --> 02:06:27.520
And other people that beautiful darkies well your life is a work of art.
Your,

2279
02:06:27.630 --> 02:06:31.620
your life is like a hand Turkey that you make in grade school.
It's,

2280
02:06:31.621 --> 02:06:34.320
you could do whatever you want with that thing.
You can make it super dope,

2281
02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:35.310
you know,
and you can,

2282
02:06:35.310 --> 02:06:37.980
you can make it so it looks really cool if you put the effort and time into it,

2283
02:06:37.981 --> 02:06:39.000
if you really focus on it.

2284
02:06:39.330 --> 02:06:43.590
Or You could just half ass that motherfucker and draw a bunch of squiggly
things.

2285
02:06:43.591 --> 02:06:44.940
Don't look anything like fingers.

2286
02:06:44.941 --> 02:06:49.140
Some eyeballs are floating above his stupid fake Turkey head.
Yup.

2287
02:06:49.230 --> 02:06:51.060
And everybody's like,
what the Fuck's wrong with Bob?

2288
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:54.930
Just look on test takers can try.
I think one of the,

2289
02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:58.080
one of the coolest pieces that I've seen,
and I have to go to the bathroom,

2290
02:06:58.081 --> 02:07:01.570
so I don't know if you want to play out,
but it's a Alan,
it's called Alan Watts.

2291
02:07:01.571 --> 02:07:04.490
Inception is the name of the video on Google.
And he talks about,

2292
02:07:04.491 --> 02:07:06.570
it's a great video.
Yeah,
right.
We'll play that.

2293
02:07:06.571 --> 02:07:07.850
We'll play then you can take your tinkle.

2294
02:07:07.980 --> 02:07:09.360
How that's gotta be at least three minutes.

2295
02:07:14.110 --> 02:07:18.000
It's four and a half,
four and a half minutes.
That's crazy.
What a break.

2296
02:07:18.180 --> 02:07:21.840
This is almost like a commercial,
but it's Alan Watts.
And before you,
uh,

2297
02:07:21.930 --> 02:07:25.830
take this as gospel,
remember Alan Watts drank himself to death.

2298
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:32.750
No one's brought to be able to alter your time sense and slip,

2299
02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:36.250
say 75 years of subjective time

2300
02:07:36.970 --> 02:07:41.860
<v 4>into eight hours of sleep.
You would,</v>

2301
02:07:41.861 --> 02:07:44.650
I suppose start out by

2302
02:07:46.210 --> 02:07:47.770
fulfilling all your wishes.

2303
02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:54.670
You could design for yourself what would be the most ecstatic life?

2304
02:07:56.980 --> 02:08:00.940
Love Affairs,
banquets,
dancing girls,

2305
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:05.590
wonderful journeys,
gardens,

2306
02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:07.060
music beyond belief.

2307
02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:15.310
And then after a couple of months of this sort of thing,

2308
02:08:15.311 --> 02:08:16.550
at 75 years and night

2309
02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:22.120
you'll be getting a little a taste for something different.

2310
02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:29.400
You would move over to an adventurous dimension.
Well,

2311
02:08:29.670 --> 02:08:33.280
there was sudden dangers involved with the thrill of dealing with dangerous.

2312
02:08:34.270 --> 02:08:37.180
And you could rescue princesses from dragons

2313
02:08:39.550 --> 02:08:41.260
and go on dangerous journeys,

2314
02:08:45.010 --> 02:08:46.930
make wonderful explosions and blow them up.

2315
02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:51.350
Eventually get into contest with enemies.

2316
02:08:54.350 --> 02:08:58.840
And after you're done that for some time you think of a new wrinkle

2317
02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:05.350
to forget that you would review
so that you would think it was all for real

2318
02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:09.280
and to be anxious

2319
02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:13.720
because it'd be so great when you woke up.

2320
02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:18.820
And then you say,
well

2321
02:09:20.660 --> 02:09:24.520
like children who dare each other on things.
How far out could you get?

2322
02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:30.730
What could you take?
What dimension of being lost?

2323
02:09:33.250 --> 02:09:36.130
Abandonment of your power,
what dimension of that could you stand?

2324
02:09:36.970 --> 02:09:39.370
You could ask yourself this cause you know you would eventually wake up

2325
02:09:42.190 --> 02:09:45.250
and I feel gone on doing this and see for some time it would suddenly find

2326
02:09:45.251 --> 02:09:48.430
yourself
sitting around in this room

2327
02:09:49.930 --> 02:09:52.810
with all your personal involvements problems

2328
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:58.840
talking with me.
How do you know that that's not what you're doing

2329
02:10:03.310 --> 02:10:05.200
because after all,
what would you do if you would god

2330
02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:10.870
give you a,
well there is the self

2331
02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:14.590
in the Upanishads,
the basic text.

2332
02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:20.760
One of them stops out beginning and looking around and said,

2333
02:10:22.460 --> 02:10:23.293
I have

2334
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:30.030
messages that everyone to this day when asked who is that as it is

2335
02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:41.660
you
keep hearing is clipping.
What is that?

2336
02:10:42.020 --> 02:10:44.840
Just the video and in this sense that you knew everything.

2337
02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:51.660
You wouldn't be bored

2338
02:10:57.140 --> 02:10:57.973
because

2339
02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:05.760
<v 1>looking at it from another way we push technology to its furthest possible</v>

2340
02:11:06.551 --> 02:11:11.260
development and we had instead of a dial telephone on one's desk,

2341
02:11:12.430 --> 02:11:14.740
a more complex system of buttons.

2342
02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:16.900
<v 4>Yeah</v>

2343
02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:17.770
<v 1>and one top</v>

2344
02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:22.480
would give you anything you wondered Aladdin's lamp.

2345
02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:29.280
You would eventually have to introduce a button labeled surprise

2346
02:11:33.410 --> 02:11:37.340
because all perfectly known futures as I pointed out our past,

2347
02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:41.810
they have happened virtually.

2348
02:11:45.220 --> 02:11:50.090
It is only the true future is a surprise.
So if you were God,

2349
02:11:51.110 --> 02:11:55.110
you would say to yourself,
mine got lost

2350
02:11:59.790 --> 02:12:04.020
Alan.
Alan Watts was bad.
Motherfucker.
That's a powerful shit.

2351
02:12:04.350 --> 02:12:09.210
You would have to say surprise me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's it.
Yeah.

2352
02:12:09.211 --> 02:12:10.920
That's a fascinating way of looking at things too.

2353
02:12:11.260 --> 02:12:13.730
It's fascinating way of looking at,
uh,
the,

2354
02:12:13.830 --> 02:12:18.830
at the past and it opens up the possibility to realize maybe this is the best

2355
02:12:18.901 --> 02:12:20.100
fucking possible world.

2356
02:12:20.101 --> 02:12:23.370
If you're just sitting around in a place where every future is perfectly known

2357
02:12:23.371 --> 02:12:25.290
and there's no surprise,
what do you want?

2358
02:12:25.530 --> 02:12:29.760
You want an opportunity to live in a crazy world like this where shit can go

2359
02:12:29.761 --> 02:12:33.900
wrong,
things can go bad or things can go brilliantly.
Well,
you know,

2360
02:12:33.901 --> 02:12:36.770
you have genuine surprise.
Yeah.
It's like that.

2361
02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:40.040
I was doing a bit about the simulation theory and it was basically saying that,

2362
02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:42.170
I mean the bed,
the,
the basic premises,

2363
02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:45.880
the bit was like if you were an alien living in some sexist world where you

2364
02:12:45.881 --> 02:12:49.800
communicate with thoughts and you don't have a penis and your body is smooth and

2365
02:12:49.801 --> 02:12:54.801
there's no danger because you literally have the control over the very Adams of

2366
02:12:54.871 --> 02:12:58.770
reality itself.
You can walk through walls,
you can never die.
That was the case.

2367
02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:02.640
What would you want to do?
I Dunno what I think I might want to drive a Mustang.

2368
02:13:02.641 --> 02:13:06.540
Get my check sock.
That's what I,
I had that same thought at this last UFC.

2369
02:13:06.541 --> 02:13:11.070
We were at amazing fucking car and I was thinking at a certain point the aliens,

2370
02:13:11.071 --> 02:13:12.210
if they exist in the world,

2371
02:13:12.211 --> 02:13:15.820
like they're so fucking jealous of us of the chaos because we could,

2372
02:13:15.870 --> 02:13:19.800
we get to experience this and be a part of something that they would never even

2373
02:13:19.801 --> 02:13:23.340
conceive of doing in their advanced civilization.
Again,

2374
02:13:23.341 --> 02:13:27.500
I think part of appreciating pieces,
understanding violence,
you know,

2375
02:13:27.540 --> 02:13:30.030
in a certain way or at least some,
some form of it.

2376
02:13:30.270 --> 02:13:32.190
I've been talking a lot about this lately

2377
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:36.120
<v 6>and it's something I'm really starting to dwell on is that,
um,</v>

2378
02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:41.300
I think it's very difficult for people to get peace without experiencing some

2379
02:13:42.031 --> 02:13:46.770
sort of pain.
And it doesn't have to be paying as far as like tragedies in life,

2380
02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:51.420
you know,
horrible relationships,
but getting fired and becoming homeless,

2381
02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:54.270
it can also be a fucking absolutely brutal workout.

2382
02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:58.170
It can also be pushing yourself to run that flight of stairs for that last time

2383
02:13:58.171 --> 02:14:01.890
where you don't want to and you force yourself to fucking power through it and

2384
02:14:01.891 --> 02:14:04.650
you become exhausted.
But then you're at peace for like the rest of the day.

2385
02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:06.840
Accomplishing your goals,
forcing your body to the limit,

2386
02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:11.880
making your body explode over and over again to get away with all this stored up

2387
02:14:12.031 --> 02:14:17.031
crazy old primate bullshit that you have clogging up your fucking veins.

2388
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:20.160
And that's that.
That's a real aspect of life.

2389
02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:22.800
That's underlooked and underappreciated and,
and,

2390
02:14:23.090 --> 02:14:26.760
and undereducated w that's,
that's something that people teach.

2391
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:29.970
It's not something that people tell you in school.
Hey listen,
you guys,

2392
02:14:29.971 --> 02:14:31.110
you guys all got hard.

2393
02:14:31.111 --> 02:14:35.000
Dick's and you're crazy right now we need to do is get a fucking sandbag,

2394
02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:37.530
throw it over your shoulder and run up that hill.
Okay.

2395
02:14:37.531 --> 02:14:41.130
And then go back down and then throw it on the other shoulder and run up that

2396
02:14:41.131 --> 02:14:44.580
fucking hill.
Come on man.
Just do it.
Trust me.
You'll feel way better.

2397
02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:48.060
And if you like,
you can do it.
Oh well then you're going to be a failure in life.

2398
02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:48.960
Do you know that Johnny?

2399
02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:51.750
Cause he's going to be times in life where you don't want to do something,

2400
02:14:51.751 --> 02:14:55.650
but you can do it.
And when you say you can't,
instead of,
I don't want to,

2401
02:14:55.740 --> 02:14:58.200
I don't want to feel anymore pain and own a feeling more tired.

2402
02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:02.430
You said can't you define yourself and you define yourself as a big fat pussy

2403
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:04.590
and not even the good car.
Cause most posts,
he's really good.

2404
02:15:05.090 --> 02:15:09.210
You're the bad kind of place,
right?
Fat,
pussy,
like that fucking sand bag.

2405
02:15:09.230 --> 02:15:10.280
I brought that out batch.

2406
02:15:11.570 --> 02:15:14.760
So everybody admires the drill sergeant and full metal jacket.

2407
02:15:14.790 --> 02:15:17.970
As crazy as he was,
he knew what it took to make a Goddamn fucking soldier.

2408
02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:20.970
He knew that he was going to scream at you and he was going to give you any love

2409
02:15:21.180 --> 02:15:25.620
outstanding who's going to talk to you about psychopaths and reward you for

2410
02:15:25.621 --> 02:15:28.440
knowing about them when they were talking about like who shot Kennedy,

2411
02:15:28.441 --> 02:15:33.330
Lee Harvey Oswald.
Char.
Yeah.
Outstanding.
Midnight.
It's Tate's marine.

2412
02:15:34.020 --> 02:15:37.200
You know,
he brought you right into it.
That's why people like that scene,

2413
02:15:37.230 --> 02:15:39.060
they liked that scene because they know that's what it takes.

2414
02:15:40.010 --> 02:15:41.690
<v 5>Yup.
I mean,
I think without,</v>

2415
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:45.860
we live in a world now where there's none of those physical dangers,
you know,

2416
02:15:45.861 --> 02:15:48.020
we don't have to run from tigers usually.
I mean,

2417
02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:49.850
of course some people still do run from tigers,

2418
02:15:50.210 --> 02:15:54.390
but we don't have people who are trying to attack us and steal our,
uh,

2419
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:58.040
our mates and our food and our resources and animals.

2420
02:15:58.370 --> 02:16:02.150
So a lot of people get to lax and comfortable and thinking,
oh,
well fuck it.

2421
02:16:02.151 --> 02:16:03.110
I don't really need to do it.

2422
02:16:03.290 --> 02:16:07.790
But what they're forgetting is that the human organism is designed to work and

2423
02:16:08.030 --> 02:16:12.180
be a working organ.
It's designed to fucking work,
you know,

2424
02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:15.590
and designed to prepare for these situations.
Even if they aren't real.

2425
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:20.270
And so the psychological and physiological effects are more important than the

2426
02:16:20.271 --> 02:16:23.840
actual,
yeah.
Okay.
I could hurdle offense if the dog was chasing me,

2427
02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:25.910
which can occasionally be important.

2428
02:16:25.911 --> 02:16:29.270
But what's more important is that you're putting your body in that optimal

2429
02:16:29.380 --> 02:16:33.500
condition for what it was designed to do.
It's designed to work,
you know,

2430
02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:34.990
the human body's designed to work.

2431
02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:38.790
The human mind is designed to solve puzzles and you know,

2432
02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:43.420
all together we're here to,
you know,
enjoy a fucking cool ass dream.
Yeah.

2433
02:16:43.490 --> 02:16:48.050
<v 0>Maybe or were fucking just trying to solve a riddle that's impossible to solve.</v>

2434
02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:50.990
Try and pretend that we've got some holes in this crazy experience

2435
02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:54.640
<v 5>just to live your life and don't be a bitch.
Be Nice and be honest,</v>

2436
02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:57.700
be honest with yourself and be nice to yourself.
There's a,

2437
02:16:57.701 --> 02:17:00.620
there's a Buddhist cone,
which I've really taken a fancy term.

2438
02:17:00.650 --> 02:17:02.290
That cone is a guest,
like a parable.

2439
02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:07.300
And the parable is there's this man who's walking through the jungle and he sees

2440
02:17:07.301 --> 02:17:09.040
a tiger and the tiger starts to chase him.

2441
02:17:09.041 --> 02:17:12.640
And the only way he can get away from this tiger is he sees some vines that are

2442
02:17:12.641 --> 02:17:13.780
going down the end of a cliff.

2443
02:17:13.781 --> 02:17:17.260
So he grabs one of the vines and he jumps and he repels down the cliff and the

2444
02:17:17.261 --> 02:17:19.120
tiger can't climb down the vine and cliff.

2445
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:20.890
So the Tigers waiting for him at the top,

2446
02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:24.730
but then he looks down below and he sees that there's another tiger waiting for

2447
02:17:24.731 --> 02:17:27.280
him at the bottom of the cliff.
So he's kind of fucked.

2448
02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:32.260
And then up a little bit higher on the vine,
he sees two mice,
a black mice,

2449
02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:36.730
black mountain and white mouse.
And they're both knowing at the vine that he has.

2450
02:17:37.420 --> 02:17:38.380
And then he says,
well,

2451
02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:41.680
and he looks to his right and he sees a little strawberry patch there and they

2452
02:17:41.681 --> 02:17:46.180
have some strawberries.
So the man just holds onto the vine,
goes,
reaches over,

2453
02:17:46.210 --> 02:17:49.900
grabs strawberry,
and it's the best fucking strawberry he's ever tasted.

2454
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:52.440
That's a great story.
Yeah.
And so the,

2455
02:17:52.441 --> 02:17:56.710
the idea is that the tiger on the top is the pain from your past.
You know,

2456
02:17:56.711 --> 02:18:00.160
in the tiger on the bottom is your worry about the future and time.

2457
02:18:00.161 --> 02:18:03.670
Are these mice that are constantly eating away at your life and what do you have

2458
02:18:03.671 --> 02:18:07.060
to do?
All you have to do is just eat the strawberries as they come.

2459
02:18:07.250 --> 02:18:08.660
<v 0>As soon as you're done eating a strawberry,</v>

2460
02:18:08.661 --> 02:18:10.340
I'm drop kicking that tie on the bottom,

2461
02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:12.920
but I'm going to do is I'm going to hang on to that rope and the moment,

2462
02:18:12.921 --> 02:18:16.070
those fucking Catie rats chewing through that rope.

2463
02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:17.660
I'm going down like a flying side,

2464
02:18:17.661 --> 02:18:21.290
taking a Bruce Lee movie right to the top of that stupid fucking Tiger's head.

2465
02:18:21.291 --> 02:18:23.810
He's not even gonna know what's happening.
No one ever landed on him before.

2466
02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:26.480
Not The way I'm going to land on him,
Bro.
I'm going to land on them.

2467
02:18:26.481 --> 02:18:29.570
I knock them out with a side kick and then I take his back with the rope with

2468
02:18:29.571 --> 02:18:32.570
the remaining.
See,
I've got this shit planned out.

2469
02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:37.280
If I'm falling any less than you know,
anything more than a hundred feet.
I'm Ted,

2470
02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:40.730
but I think I'm a 70 feet.
I'm going to side kick them right in the fucking head.

2471
02:18:42.310 --> 02:18:45.860
He's going out with the beginning.
Is he keeled?
Choke.

2472
02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:49.010
I've got a strong as he bro,
that was my number one key move.

2473
02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:53.000
Zeke you'll chokes are good,
but it's not like a bow and arrow.
Well,
no,
no.

2474
02:18:53.001 --> 02:18:57.020
Zeke you'll choke is um,
um,
it's a a choke where you,
uh,

2475
02:18:57.021 --> 02:18:58.790
you actually use your color like this.

2476
02:19:00.850 --> 02:19:04.490
You do it across the face like this and it's a,
a geek choke,

2477
02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:07.160
but there's a no arm.
There's no armor.
Zeke,
you'll choke that.

2478
02:19:07.161 --> 02:19:11.240
Someone tried this weekend but they didn't pull it off.
Goddammit.

2479
02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:15.950
I forget who it was.
Might've been,
might've been the Ronda Rousey fight.
No,

2480
02:19:16.220 --> 02:19:19.220
God dammit.
I can't remember.
So many fights.
So many awesome fights this weekend.

2481
02:19:19.430 --> 02:19:22.360
But it didn't work.
That's why I don't remember it.
But the no arm is eagle.

2482
02:19:22.361 --> 02:19:26.570
You'll choke is a,
that's not a Zq.
Uh,
the no armor Zeke,
you'll choke.

2483
02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:30.230
You essentially have the head trapped like this.

2484
02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:34.610
And then you like rear naked choke in the back like you know,

2485
02:19:34.611 --> 02:19:37.580
like behind like a reverse,
like rear naked choke.

2486
02:19:37.610 --> 02:19:41.030
That position where you a karate chop the back of the neck and you choke a guy

2487
02:19:41.031 --> 02:19:43.480
out with your shin across there.
You ever see a Zeke?

2488
02:19:43.490 --> 02:19:47.900
You'll that's a [inaudible] with the Geeky,
but he's not doing it right.

2489
02:19:48.110 --> 02:19:52.650
Motherfucker.
Don't show me shit examples like I've got a shitty week.
Um,

2490
02:19:53.870 --> 02:19:56.720
but it's um,
you know when you rear naked choke somebody,

2491
02:19:56.750 --> 02:19:58.250
the arm goes underneath the chin,

2492
02:19:58.251 --> 02:20:00.890
the forum goes across the neck and then you karate chop the back of the neck.

2493
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:02.390
You essentially do the same technique,

2494
02:20:02.391 --> 02:20:04.850
but you do it from the front and he cried a chopped the front of the neck.

2495
02:20:04.900 --> 02:20:06.230
It doesn't have the same amount of leverage though.

2496
02:20:06.231 --> 02:20:07.920
It's not the Chins of the way.
It's,

2497
02:20:07.921 --> 02:20:09.980
it's about enough to fucking take a tiger down.

2498
02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:15.270
Guy Like me gets hauled that tiger.
Yeah,
I'll take that function cube.

2499
02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:18.020
Imagine you land on that tiger.
The tiger would fucking,
first of all,

2500
02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:23.180
Swat you out of there like a palm palm and just drive you into the ground with

2501
02:20:23.181 --> 02:20:25.760
all his extra thousand pounds.
As you're coming down.

2502
02:20:26.090 --> 02:20:28.760
He probably knows how to kill goats to try to land on them.
What's the,

2503
02:20:28.761 --> 02:20:31.640
what's the largest big cat that you think you could take?

2504
02:20:31.790 --> 02:20:34.490
I don't know if I could take my house cat.
I think my house cat knows.

2505
02:20:34.491 --> 02:20:37.280
I know where the food is,
so they know that they don't give me a hard time.

2506
02:20:37.281 --> 02:20:41.600
This is a classic video of a tiger jumping up on a guy who's on a fucking

2507
02:20:41.601 --> 02:20:44.330
elephant.
Oh God.
Fuck.

2508
02:20:44.331 --> 02:20:49.150
That guy's armed up to just shredded his arm.
Yeah,
with just one club.

2509
02:20:49.151 --> 02:20:52.910
But the,
the distance,
those things can jump.
It's just so stunning.

2510
02:20:53.900 --> 02:20:57.560
And they have razors for hands.
I mean,
look at this thing,

2511
02:20:57.561 --> 02:20:59.900
jump up and just rip him apart.

2512
02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:05.320
It's so fucked up to see that you're such a weakened soft little bitch.

2513
02:21:05.870 --> 02:21:10.400
Nothing.
Yeah.
You're looking at in that field you don't see shit.
Well,

2514
02:21:10.401 --> 02:21:13.880
that's the thing about these things in the grass in India especially,
you know,

2515
02:21:13.881 --> 02:21:18.190
there was a bit in my talking about I'd be mowing lawns all.
Yeah.

2516
02:21:18.420 --> 02:21:21.350
I was like not want to let your lawn overgrow.

2517
02:21:21.410 --> 02:21:25.730
There was a bit in my talking monkeys in space,
uh,
um,
comedy special.

2518
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:30.320
That was about true story about the cinder bands were over the last 200 years,

2519
02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:35.510
tigers have killed 300,000 people in the center bands.
What?
Yes.
Yeah.

2520
02:21:35.511 --> 02:21:36.920
Over the last 200 years,
I'll say it again.

2521
02:21:37.070 --> 02:21:40.670
Tigers have killed 300,000 people.

2522
02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:43.490
They kill people all the fucking time there.

2523
02:21:43.550 --> 02:21:47.810
And there's a story that I told them in my special about this one tiger that

2524
02:21:47.811 --> 02:21:52.730
killed three men on a boat of five swam out to the boat.

2525
02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:54.770
And I didn't even know tigers could swim,

2526
02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:57.830
but apparently it's swimming faster than five guys can row a boat,

2527
02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:01.430
climbed into the boat,
killed the guy,
dragged his body to the shore,

2528
02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:04.670
dropped it off,
hot back in the water,
swim back out to the boat,

2529
02:22:04.671 --> 02:22:08.180
killed another guy,
took him into the water dragon,
did it three times,

2530
02:22:09.800 --> 02:22:13.550
killed three guys in a boat of five.
And they just do it all the time.

2531
02:22:13.820 --> 02:22:15.770
And they say that because of the typhoons,
you know the people,

2532
02:22:15.771 --> 02:22:20.330
they're extremely poor and a lot of them,
they,
they live in like rural villages.

2533
02:22:20.331 --> 02:22:23.690
And,
and when the floods hit,
like if this typhoons,

2534
02:22:23.691 --> 02:22:27.060
a lot of people die and the getting to the river and the Tigers become

2535
02:22:27.061 --> 02:22:29.430
accustomed to the taste of human flesh because of this.

2536
02:22:29.730 --> 02:22:32.790
And then there's another theory about the water there because the water there is

2537
02:22:32.791 --> 02:22:35.370
very brackish and the Tigers have no other water to drink.

2538
02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:39.030
So this heavy salt content water apparently irritates the fuck out of them.

2539
02:22:39.390 --> 02:22:42.300
It makes them extremely aggressive cause they're constantly agitated.

2540
02:22:42.660 --> 02:22:47.520
So they're just their bodies like and then just it and they just jump in that

2541
02:22:47.521 --> 02:22:50.640
water and roid rage on you and pull the fucking person out of the boat.

2542
02:22:50.641 --> 02:22:52.170
And if it's that prevalent,

2543
02:22:52.171 --> 02:22:55.950
you think they would be a little bit better at fighting off tigers.

2544
02:22:55.950 --> 02:22:58.880
Like the mastectomy.
They protect them.
Yeah.

2545
02:22:58.890 --> 02:23:01.680
But at least you have to defend your life when it happens though.

2546
02:23:01.681 --> 02:23:04.770
Not like saying going out and hunting them.
Obviously we know how to deplete,

2547
02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:06.810
you know,
a species from the face of the earth.

2548
02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:08.690
But I'm saying like even the Messiah,

2549
02:23:08.700 --> 02:23:11.700
the way they designed their spears or partly for people,

2550
02:23:11.701 --> 02:23:14.090
but also partly for fucking lions,
you know,

2551
02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:17.460
so that they don't even fear the lions really when they're in the group with

2552
02:23:17.461 --> 02:23:20.190
their,
cause they have,
you know,
they know they got the range on them,

2553
02:23:20.450 --> 02:23:23.550
but they can't get to him at least fucking,
I watched the knife,

2554
02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:26.490
the knife channel QVC at least get one of those,
you know,

2555
02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:29.900
$10 Ninja swords that you can keep that motherfucker away.

2556
02:23:30.390 --> 02:23:32.160
I don't think you understand what a tiger is,
son,

2557
02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:34.320
and then just sort of going to do a goddamn thing.

2558
02:23:34.590 --> 02:23:36.420
You're never going to get much happier with that.

2559
02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:40.470
Especially if it's swimming up to your boat.
Got No chance.
You got no chance.

2560
02:23:40.680 --> 02:23:42.960
They're going to get you.
It's so big.

2561
02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:45.780
You're not going to hack through all that meat.
It's going to get in there.

2562
02:23:45.781 --> 02:23:47.310
It's going to be so mad at you for cutting it.

2563
02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:48.780
It's gonna rip you to little pieces.

2564
02:23:48.781 --> 02:23:53.730
Dick burst the animal like it's like saying if I fought Tyson,
what I'll do is,

2565
02:23:53.790 --> 02:23:56.310
first of all,
I poke him in the eyes and then I kick him in the nuts.

2566
02:23:56.520 --> 02:23:59.040
There's always that one guy that we talked to,
the how to plan and bro,

2567
02:23:59.041 --> 02:24:01.350
they ain't never fuck with me.
I bite,
I bite motherfucker.

2568
02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:04.500
We didn't know Tyson bit people back in the day,
but that's what people think of.

2569
02:24:04.501 --> 02:24:07.980
They think they would how they would deal with a tiger maybe so you can't,

2570
02:24:08.010 --> 02:24:12.960
he can't do a God damn it.
I would definitely have some,
oh shit.
Yeah,

2571
02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:16.950
it'd be nice.
That's a tiger being nice that's playing.

2572
02:24:17.820 --> 02:24:21.900
That's you have no chance.
If that thing was angry you,
God damn it,

2573
02:24:21.901 --> 02:24:25.490
there's no chance and last year have guns.
I'll fog and

2574
02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:30.090
I'll punch a hole through your reality son.

2575
02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:32.790
If I have a rifle of a high powered rifle,
you know?
Yeah,

2576
02:24:32.791 --> 02:24:35.550
I'll fuck a tiger up at a rifle,
but I wouldn't want to.

2577
02:24:35.730 --> 02:24:39.480
You know how intense you would be on making the shot correctly,

2578
02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:41.340
how much you'd be fucking shaking if there was,

2579
02:24:41.341 --> 02:24:44.040
I taught grammar in the water and you know you only have a certain amount of

2580
02:24:44.041 --> 02:24:46.590
space to hit this motherfucker.
You have what?
What if you pulled the trigger?

2581
02:24:46.591 --> 02:24:49.440
It goes click and you got a bad bullet.
Fuck.

2582
02:24:49.500 --> 02:24:51.930
How many seconds did it take for that thing to get on you?
You're dead.

2583
02:24:51.930 --> 02:24:53.820
You're dead.
It that I saw that fucking video.

2584
02:24:53.821 --> 02:24:58.620
They were selling craziest videos at 2013 this dude goes to assassinate somebody

2585
02:24:58.621 --> 02:25:01.590
giving a speech and he's seen that he runs up,

2586
02:25:01.740 --> 02:25:06.150
has the gun right to his head and gun jam right there and then the fucking

2587
02:25:06.151 --> 02:25:08.970
security guards just beat the shit out of it.
That was crazy.

2588
02:25:08.971 --> 02:25:12.090
That was a crash or something along those lines.
Something like that.

2589
02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:17.640
What's that Bulgari area?
Wow.
Wild Shit.
Yeah man.

2590
02:25:17.641 --> 02:25:20.400
That shit goes down.
Well,
how about Kim Jong?
Ooh,
look at that guy.

2591
02:25:20.401 --> 02:25:22.440
He was walked up to him,
pull the trigger and nothing.

2592
02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:25.330
What you do that and you shoot for a double sign.
No one's shooting that.

2593
02:25:25.350 --> 02:25:28.480
There you go.
And then we do.
When you get them down,
where?

2594
02:25:28.481 --> 02:25:32.680
Where's the soccer kicks folks?
You got the guy down?
No one's soccer kicking him.

2595
02:25:32.710 --> 02:25:35.380
Are you crazy?
This guy had a gun.
You supposed to soccer.

2596
02:25:35.381 --> 02:25:38.350
Kick the shit out of that dude.
There's the soccer kicks.
I saw a little.

2597
02:25:38.530 --> 02:25:42.910
I didn't see enough.
Yeah,
a little sidekick.
Action.
There we go.

2598
02:25:44.620 --> 02:25:47.080
Why are they holding people back?
Oh,
there's a little kick to the head.

2599
02:25:47.140 --> 02:25:48.550
They're not doing a good job of holding them down.

2600
02:25:48.551 --> 02:25:51.850
The guys got good fucking take down defense.
I'll give them that strong guy.

2601
02:25:52.660 --> 02:25:54.790
They should kick that guy.
Why are you punching her?
Are you're gonna hurt?

2602
02:25:54.791 --> 02:25:58.600
Your hands are going to get teeth marks all over him when he's down.
Stomp,
stomp,

2603
02:25:58.601 --> 02:26:02.890
stomp.
While they're beating the shit.
He's in their phones now.
Yeah,

2604
02:26:02.891 --> 02:26:05.840
it's not good enough.
You've kissed,
got to keep kicking lazy bitches.

2605
02:26:05.841 --> 02:26:09.650
That guy's going to wake up and you're not done.
You're,

2606
02:26:09.900 --> 02:26:12.360
that was some crazy shit.
I mean,
imagine you just,

2607
02:26:13.390 --> 02:26:17.060
just knowing that you're that guy and your life was saved by gun jams.

2608
02:26:17.410 --> 02:26:21.370
How about the North Koreans and the Kim Jong Uhmm killed his uncle.
He was like,

2609
02:26:21.371 --> 02:26:23.260
yeah,
you know what I'm fucking done with you.

2610
02:26:23.261 --> 02:26:26.510
Dude killed his uncle and then gave his wife some sort of a res.

2611
02:26:26.780 --> 02:26:30.350
Kim's wife's like some new promotion.
The Guy,
he's,
he killed it,

2612
02:26:30.390 --> 02:26:35.080
gave his wife a Gig.
Wow.
Whoa,
whoa son.
And it's song call.

2613
02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:38.830
Well,
he's like,
yeah,
you know,
can't have you around anymore.

2614
02:26:38.831 --> 02:26:41.860
And Dennis robins like,
listen man,
I'm just going over there to play basketball.

2615
02:26:42.250 --> 02:26:44.230
You know,
dude has some problems with his uncle.

2616
02:26:44.231 --> 02:26:48.500
I don't know nothing about all that.
Dennis Robbins still going to go over there,

2617
02:26:48.530 --> 02:26:53.290
play basketball.
That's a weird fucking world tennis.
Don't do that.

2618
02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:56.590
Then it's Dennis wore a wedding dress through his wedding.
I know.

2619
02:26:56.591 --> 02:26:57.181
Could you imagine though,

2620
02:26:57.181 --> 02:26:59.620
if Dennis was the guy that talked this guy into peace and harmony,

2621
02:26:59.780 --> 02:27:03.780
what if Dennis goes over there with Mtma Kim,
John's uncle Ken filling rooms.

2622
02:27:03.780 --> 02:27:08.550
Definitely.
Wow.
Wow.
That's what he said.
Remove the filter.
Go.

2623
02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:12.370
So,
hey,
we don't,
we don't know.
Maybe his uncle was a real piece of shit.

2624
02:27:12.460 --> 02:27:15.850
How about that?
That's possible too.
I'm just talking a lot of junk.
I'm really,

2625
02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:19.170
I'm still stuck on your Dennis Rodman.
Bring it to the Mtma over there.

2626
02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:24.070
That's the move.
He's got access.
Oh,
you know he does.
If he got Kim Jong,
Ooh,

2627
02:27:24.100 --> 02:27:27.490
like Super Fun.
Maybe he did.
Maybe that's why Kim Jong home killed his uncle.

2628
02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:29.890
Maybe you just realize like,
my uncle's an asshole.

2629
02:27:29.891 --> 02:27:33.010
Everybody else is so cool around here.
There's only one way for peace on earth.

2630
02:27:33.450 --> 02:27:38.160
He said some shit about Rodman.
Could be fuck that Rodman.
Yeah.
Fuck that nigger.

2631
02:27:38.170 --> 02:27:41.380
We as pills.
What?
What'd you say,
uncle?

2632
02:27:42.490 --> 02:27:46.080
Fucking racist bastard.
Shoot him wife starts crying.

2633
02:27:46.230 --> 02:27:48.310
This is good news and bad news.

2634
02:27:52.810 --> 02:27:53.980
The bad news is,
is dead.

2635
02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:57.190
The good news is he can't tell you not to buy shoes anymore.
All right?
Okay.

2636
02:27:57.191 --> 02:27:59.830
And I'm going to give you a rate by a little by all kinds of shapes.

2637
02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:03.550
Rodman's bringing some of the good Molly.
We both know that guy was a dick.

2638
02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:07.030
All right,
speaking of Dick,
you ever seen Robin's Dick?
Do you want to?

2639
02:28:07.450 --> 02:28:12.100
Cause I know him.
It's always wet.
It's like a snake.
It's black like the night,

2640
02:28:12.410 --> 02:28:15.640
and it looks like the aliens tongue,
it comes down.
It's just,

2641
02:28:15.641 --> 02:28:17.670
it's almost like it's lubed.

2642
02:28:17.950 --> 02:28:22.230
Like from the jump dripping glistening.
It has a shell,

2643
02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:24.950
<v 6>like the teeth on the aliens are going to pull those teeth doubts.</v>

2644
02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:28.770
Then that fucking all that saliva dripping.

2645
02:28:29.310 --> 02:28:33.230
It turns out the Dennis Rodman's testicles don't exude sweat,

2646
02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:36.500
but rather saliva.
It could be one of those science shows.

2647
02:28:36.860 --> 02:28:41.860
Is it true that Dennis Rodman's penis trip saliva dean,

2648
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:43.063
yes.

2649
02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:48.260
In a very unusual circumstance that science has yet to explain.

2650
02:28:48.830 --> 02:28:53.360
They've recognized a Dennis Rodman is have a special species of Dick slingers

2651
02:28:53.810 --> 02:28:55.820
self lubing Dick slingers

2652
02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:01.580
order to compensate for his overtly large member.
Yes.

2653
02:29:01.610 --> 02:29:03.800
It just exudes lube.

2654
02:29:03.801 --> 02:29:07.010
It's far more viscous than Astroglide.

2655
02:29:07.011 --> 02:29:08.840
They're fascinated by this loop and they're like,

2656
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:13.400
this could solve friction in the universe is lube is so good.

2657
02:29:13.401 --> 02:29:14.780
They're gonna use it for motor oil.

2658
02:29:14.781 --> 02:29:18.460
Now they're going to clone Dennis Rodman's Dick Saliva.
So anyways,

2659
02:29:18.660 --> 02:29:23.660
we'll go 30% faster using pissed pound isolated is get 10% more miles per gallon

2660
02:29:25.161 --> 02:29:28.610
when they travel through Dennis Rodman's,
his cock saliva.

2661
02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:32.570
Then like mobile one mobile ones inefficient.
That's not good.
You know,

2662
02:29:32.571 --> 02:29:35.210
that's fucking gets hot so wide.
It can get hot,
real hot.

2663
02:29:35.450 --> 02:29:37.790
Dennis Robbins Saliva never boils.

2664
02:29:37.870 --> 02:29:42.650
We get that athletes on his Dick's probably like my arm.

2665
02:29:44.540 --> 02:29:48.010
I would reconcile it.
Were there any better way to end this podcast?
Tom?

2666
02:29:48.020 --> 02:29:50.360
I think we've gone full circle.
Yeah,
let's talk about those,

2667
02:29:50.490 --> 02:29:52.990
these crazy vitamin tests because I wanted,

2668
02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.220
one of the things I wanted to talk to you about,
uh,

2669
02:29:55.430 --> 02:29:58.220
when we're here as one of the things that you and I talked about on the phone

2670
02:29:58.490 --> 02:29:59.323
about,
um,

2671
02:29:59.420 --> 02:30:04.280
this weird fucking vitamins study that came out where they're like,

2672
02:30:04.281 --> 02:30:04.760
you know,

2673
02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:09.650
multivitamins don't do any good and can fact possibly harm case closed.

2674
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:15.070
And they based it on these three ridiculous studies that are so ridiculous.

2675
02:30:15.860 --> 02:30:19.430
In terms of the,
the context of saying that vitamins don't help you,

2676
02:30:19.580 --> 02:30:24.080
it's so irresponsible what they said in relation to their actual findings that I

2677
02:30:24.081 --> 02:30:25.280
almost feel like they're trolling.

2678
02:30:25.500 --> 02:30:29.060
I almost feel like they wanted to get people to talk about it or they wanted to

2679
02:30:29.061 --> 02:30:31.670
get it out there because someone,

2680
02:30:31.671 --> 02:30:36.470
whether it's the pharmaceutical people or whoever perceives supplements and

2681
02:30:36.471 --> 02:30:36.801
vitamins,

2682
02:30:36.801 --> 02:30:41.210
supplements to be some sort of a competition is trying to discredit the idea

2683
02:30:41.360 --> 02:30:45.650
that scientific analysis of nutrients and extracting them in a very specific

2684
02:30:45.651 --> 02:30:46.310
form,

2685
02:30:46.310 --> 02:30:50.780
knowing that very specific form has a very specific reaction in the human body

2686
02:30:50.781 --> 02:30:53.390
is nonsense.
Why are we giving people shots of [inaudible]?

2687
02:30:53.490 --> 02:30:57.770
Can you explain why vitamin C cure scurvy was,
what the fuck are you saying?

2688
02:30:57.950 --> 02:31:00.740
Multivitamins don't help.
They're no good really.

2689
02:31:00.741 --> 02:31:04.130
And based on what now tell the people based on what now this is where it gets

2690
02:31:04.131 --> 02:31:05.270
squirrely.
Yeah.

2691
02:31:05.271 --> 02:31:08.000
So they did the three studies and one of the studies that they showed and

2692
02:31:08.001 --> 02:31:09.400
basically,
you know,
first of all,

2693
02:31:09.420 --> 02:31:13.190
these are just run of the mill cheap as they come.
Multivitamins,

2694
02:31:13.220 --> 02:31:17.030
lot of synthetic sources,
you know,
certainly not the optimal way to do it,

2695
02:31:17.031 --> 02:31:20.250
but any hard ass one of,
yeah.
So

2696
02:31:20.670 --> 02:31:25.140
<v 5>they give these people who had already suffered one kind of heart attack or some</v>

2697
02:31:25.141 --> 02:31:27.720
kind of cardio,
a failure of some sort,

2698
02:31:27.930 --> 02:31:32.460
and then they give him multivitamins and see if they reduce the amount of

2699
02:31:32.461 --> 02:31:35.760
continued problems that these people have with their hearts.
Well,

2700
02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:39.090
at the point that you already had a heart attack and then you give somebody

2701
02:31:39.091 --> 02:31:39.924
multivitamins,

2702
02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:43.590
maybe that's not enough to stem the tide of degenerative heart disease.

2703
02:31:43.591 --> 02:31:48.300
So that study showed no benefit from multivitamins.
They did another one of,

2704
02:31:48.330 --> 02:31:52.680
in studying people who are at high risk for cognitive decline,

2705
02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:55.620
older men at like a 65 and over,

2706
02:31:56.130 --> 02:32:01.080
and they gave him multivitamins and multivitamins didn't show that they cured

2707
02:32:01.081 --> 02:32:04.080
the potential for Alzheimer's and degenerative brain conditions.

2708
02:32:04.470 --> 02:32:07.380
And so they take these studies and then there's some other study we're actually

2709
02:32:07.381 --> 02:32:10.050
did show some,
some benefit that they kind of lumped in there,

2710
02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:14.580
but they take these and then they say,
make this absurdly broad statement,

2711
02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.070
multivitamins don't work,
case closed.

2712
02:32:17.080 --> 02:32:19.800
And then a lot of the headlines said supplements don't work,

2713
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:22.470
case closed and so what you know,

2714
02:32:22.770 --> 02:32:27.600
obviously this is saying that in these two specific very high risk instances,

2715
02:32:27.690 --> 02:32:32.690
some very cheaply made multivitamins aren't going to be enough to change the

2716
02:32:32.821 --> 02:32:34.890
tide of events that are going to happen.

2717
02:32:35.310 --> 02:32:39.720
But then you can look at a lot of other events and I think probably I listed in

2718
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:40.441
my article,

2719
02:32:40.441 --> 02:32:44.610
I listed five of the Pub Med studies that are out there and some are showing

2720
02:32:44.611 --> 02:32:45.720
benefit for mood,

2721
02:32:45.721 --> 02:32:50.010
some are showing different benefit for quality of life markers in double blind

2722
02:32:50.011 --> 02:32:52.980
placebo controlled studies with these very same multivitamins.

2723
02:32:53.220 --> 02:32:57.510
But the most telling one I thought was they did a study where they took juvenile

2724
02:32:57.511 --> 02:33:01.390
delinquents and they gave some of them multivitamin,

2725
02:33:01.391 --> 02:33:05.130
some of them are placebo and then they studied their rate of recidivism,

2726
02:33:05.131 --> 02:33:06.660
the rate of delinquency,

2727
02:33:06.930 --> 02:33:11.930
and there was a 50% improvement in those people who receive the multivitamin.

2728
02:33:12.440 --> 02:33:15.210
<v 6>Well not only that,
two of the three things,
it is important that you,</v>

2729
02:33:15.240 --> 02:33:17.870
you talked about earlier of the three studies that they cited,

2730
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:21.710
two of the three were negative.
One was fairly positive.
Yeah.

2731
02:33:21.890 --> 02:33:25.070
This is the fairly positive on a previously released study concluded that

2732
02:33:25.071 --> 02:33:29.120
limited evidence supports any benefit from vitamin and mineral supplementation

2733
02:33:29.121 --> 02:33:31.610
for the prevention of cancer or cardiovascular disease.

2734
02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:36.820
But two trials found small borderline significant benefit from multivitamin

2735
02:33:36.981 --> 02:33:41.390
supplements on cancer in men only and no effect on cardiovascular disease.

2736
02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:46.250
So shitty vitamins to people who are dying helped a little.
Helped a little.

2737
02:33:46.700 --> 02:33:47.001
Okay.

2738
02:33:47.001 --> 02:33:51.710
Why is that saying that vitamins don't work and the idea that all vitamins are

2739
02:33:51.711 --> 02:33:54.110
created equal is preposterous.

2740
02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:59.030
And there by saying multivitamins,
you're including plant based vitamins,

2741
02:33:59.031 --> 02:34:00.020
extractions,

2742
02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:04.400
plant extractions from super nutrient dense foods that have been shown through

2743
02:34:04.401 --> 02:34:08.480
rehydration to have significant health benefits.
What are you talking about?

2744
02:34:08.660 --> 02:34:11.240
Like what exactly you guys doing it?
Why are you doing it?

2745
02:34:11.450 --> 02:34:15.350
Because it seems like you trying to get people unhealthy.
Why wouldn't you spend,

2746
02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:16.910
I mean that doesn't make any sense at all.

2747
02:34:16.911 --> 02:34:20.230
Why you spend time studying the difference between multivitamins and Nance form

2748
02:34:20.380 --> 02:34:24.180
and say like a superfood supplement or massive amounts of a,
you know,

2749
02:34:24.190 --> 02:34:26.710
dietary Greens,
dried greens,
you know,
the,

2750
02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:28.780
what if you add that to your diet three times a day,

2751
02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:30.910
how much of an increase without having the benefits of health,

2752
02:34:31.030 --> 02:34:34.060
how about let's study healthy people and see if we can keep them healthy instead

2753
02:34:34.061 --> 02:34:37.900
of waiting for old dudes that have already had heart attacks and see if a hard

2754
02:34:37.901 --> 02:34:41.670
pill fixes them.
Like what kind of stupid fucking stuff.

2755
02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:43.460
<v 5>Yeah,
it's,
it's really,</v>

2756
02:34:43.580 --> 02:34:47.510
it's really bad how that all came out and especially because most people just

2757
02:34:47.511 --> 02:34:51.320
read the headlines and so they'll use that excuse and a lot of the headlines are

2758
02:34:51.321 --> 02:34:55.820
generalizations.
You know,
the headlines say case closed supplements don't work.

2759
02:34:55.821 --> 02:34:59.210
I saw that as a headline and a bunch of things.
First of all,
that's not true.

2760
02:34:59.240 --> 02:34:59.811
I mean,
yes,

2761
02:34:59.811 --> 02:35:03.770
these studies were valid for these type of vitamins in these type of conditions.

2762
02:35:03.980 --> 02:35:07.610
But there's also tons of studies that show positive benefits,
you know,

2763
02:35:07.611 --> 02:35:10.490
and it's just really ashamed when that starts to happen.

2764
02:35:10.491 --> 02:35:13.730
And it makes you question,
you know,
in those situations you follow the money.

2765
02:35:13.731 --> 02:35:17.930
Who's to benefit from blowing this out of proportion the wrong way.
And you know,

2766
02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:20.560
there's a lot of money in sick people and you know,
and,

2767
02:35:20.561 --> 02:35:23.120
and I don't know how much that plays in effect.
Look,
I don't have,

2768
02:35:23.390 --> 02:35:27.830
I don't have the,
the,
the vision to see behind all the scenes of what's going on.

2769
02:35:27.831 --> 02:35:31.940
But it makes you at least question why this is getting so ridiculously out of

2770
02:35:31.941 --> 02:35:32.330
proportion.

2771
02:35:32.330 --> 02:35:33.900
<v 6>And even if not,
even if,
you know,</v>

2772
02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:36.230
we're being conspiratorial and seeing things that way.

2773
02:35:36.231 --> 02:35:39.290
And even if what's really going on is that people want it to get attention for

2774
02:35:39.291 --> 02:35:43.580
their work.
So they trolled us and they said case closed and everybody bit.

2775
02:35:43.790 --> 02:35:47.120
And so then their work got published and downloaded and everybody got excited

2776
02:35:47.121 --> 02:35:50.090
about it.
And then there's people I told you vitamins are nonsense.

2777
02:35:50.310 --> 02:35:51.850
Those nonsense haters,
you know,

2778
02:35:51.851 --> 02:35:53.900
there's a lot of people that hate nonsense in any shape or form.

2779
02:35:53.901 --> 02:35:56.660
And if you show up mushrooms going to save the world.

2780
02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:01.040
And those nonsense lovers are nonsense haters.

2781
02:36:01.100 --> 02:36:03.140
They just go right along with it and you know,

2782
02:36:03.141 --> 02:36:06.020
you get people to pay attention to you.
We've got people to pay attention.

2783
02:36:06.021 --> 02:36:08.920
This guy,
I don't know.
I don't even know who the fuck this guy is.
You know?

2784
02:36:08.930 --> 02:36:10.220
I don't know who made those studies.

2785
02:36:10.221 --> 02:36:12.530
I don't know who concluded it or why they published it,

2786
02:36:12.531 --> 02:36:14.090
but I do know that it made me talk about it.

2787
02:36:14.210 --> 02:36:17.840
<v 5>Yeah.
And that he was successful in doing that.
It really interesting,</v>

2788
02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:22.210
interesting world.
You know,
I think,
I think the good thing is is that you know,

2789
02:36:22.220 --> 02:36:26.360
the people who are really paying attention and hopefully can dig a little deeper

2790
02:36:26.361 --> 02:36:29.240
and go through the bullshit.
I think if this came out,
you know,

2791
02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:32.000
before pre Internet and this was just all over the news,

2792
02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:34.100
it gets way more damaging.
You know there was,

2793
02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:38.420
there was a report that caught wind like this about Mtma that talking to the

2794
02:36:38.421 --> 02:36:41.600
guys at maps,
they're still dealing with the fallout from some of this.

2795
02:36:41.870 --> 02:36:46.870
They did a study on Mtma that showed high levels of neuro toxicity and it just

2796
02:36:46.881 --> 02:36:49.580
hit every piece of news is right along.

2797
02:36:49.940 --> 02:36:53.150
And everybody picked it up and the whole world kind of took notice of it.

2798
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:56.780
And then about two years later they went back and looked at the compounds use

2799
02:36:57.020 --> 02:37:01.040
and said,
oh whoops,
that wasn't Mtma.
That was speed.

2800
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:03.600
And then so they do,

2801
02:37:03.620 --> 02:37:08.090
they write a retraction and too late everybody said,

2802
02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:11.120
ah Mtma fucking melt your brain bro.

2803
02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:14.370
Cause they got that first bit in and then you know,

2804
02:37:14.660 --> 02:37:16.340
the wasn't there to debunk it.

2805
02:37:16.341 --> 02:37:19.460
The people weren't there to do bucket and it just didn't,
didn't take off.

2806
02:37:19.461 --> 02:37:24.461
And now still that's a headwind preventing people from getting really solid PTSD

2807
02:37:25.101 --> 02:37:29.300
and other types of psychological care because of some of this misinformation

2808
02:37:29.301 --> 02:37:30.030
that came out.

2809
02:37:30.030 --> 02:37:33.420
<v 6>Yeah,
it gets real tricky because if you're not the type of person that's online</v>

2810
02:37:33.421 --> 02:37:36.750
research and this stuff every day when these stories come out and you sort of

2811
02:37:36.751 --> 02:37:37.770
recite what you've heard,

2812
02:37:38.220 --> 02:37:41.460
you can fuck up some people around whose lives cause you know,
they could,

2813
02:37:41.490 --> 02:37:45.450
they could really believe some of the things that people have a falsely.

2814
02:37:45.890 --> 02:37:50.700
If the problem is it's impossible to take it out once it's out there,

2815
02:37:50.790 --> 02:37:52.020
it's impossible to take it out.

2816
02:37:52.170 --> 02:37:54.810
So if you start telling people that vitamins aren't going to help you and

2817
02:37:54.811 --> 02:37:57.270
vitamins actually could have helped them,
like God,
man,

2818
02:37:57.271 --> 02:37:59.460
you're kind of responsible for them getting fucked up.

2819
02:37:59.910 --> 02:38:03.000
Like if people get sick and that's sickness could have been prevented because of

2820
02:38:03.001 --> 02:38:07.920
vitamins like God,
it's the 10 that your diet is not important.

2821
02:38:07.921 --> 02:38:11.000
Pretend it's supplements and nutrition is not important.
Well,
what would it need?

2822
02:38:11.010 --> 02:38:14.220
What does nutrition,
do we know the basic elements of,
of,

2823
02:38:14.221 --> 02:38:17.550
of food that are nutritious.
Uh,
kind of.
Yeah.
Kind of.

2824
02:38:17.551 --> 02:38:21.930
Do you know why science,
that's what people are.
People like,
you know,

2825
02:38:21.931 --> 02:38:23.520
like there's no science behind these vitamins.

2826
02:38:23.610 --> 02:38:27.000
How the fuck do you think they got there?
Do you think hippies made vitamins?

2827
02:38:27.060 --> 02:38:30.510
Do you think hippies and other differences?
You vitamin A and B and C and d.

2828
02:38:30.780 --> 02:38:35.690
Come on son.
This is all science.
Science has figured out these vitamins.
Okay.

2829
02:38:36.350 --> 02:38:38.370
These,
yeah,
there's rocks that you swallow.

2830
02:38:38.371 --> 02:38:41.970
The blue rocks and those aren't so good for you.
Yeah.
You know why?

2831
02:38:41.971 --> 02:38:43.830
Because your body doesn't know what the fuck that is.
Yeah.

2832
02:38:43.860 --> 02:38:46.140
It doesn't look like food so far from food.

2833
02:38:46.170 --> 02:38:48.750
Your body doesn't know why he's throwing some stomach acid on it,

2834
02:38:48.751 --> 02:38:52.620
but it seems like nothing's happening.
Let's just shit this out dude.
This shit.

2835
02:38:52.650 --> 02:38:57.020
I think we're supposed to eat the rock dude.
I'm on the fucking guy upstairs.

2836
02:38:57.060 --> 02:38:58.740
Not that's too,
but he's not feeding us rocks.

2837
02:38:58.741 --> 02:39:01.620
This snuck en mass and we probably put in his mouth while he's sleeping.

2838
02:39:02.070 --> 02:39:04.170
The stupid fucking Blue Rock.

2839
02:39:05.310 --> 02:39:08.910
<v 5>Yeah.
You mean eat a healthy diet?
Eat a very varied in balanced diet.</v>

2840
02:39:08.911 --> 02:39:10.950
And when you wanted to get these nutrients,
you know,

2841
02:39:10.980 --> 02:39:12.720
go to the most natural source possible.

2842
02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:16.470
Go back to the Himalayan salt has great minerals that are,
you know,

2843
02:39:16.620 --> 02:39:20.250
difficult to get in the soil that keeps getting overused,
fresh vegetables,

2844
02:39:20.490 --> 02:39:22.350
fresh fruit,
fresh vegetables and fruits.

2845
02:39:22.351 --> 02:39:24.180
And if you can't get fresh vegetables and fruits,

2846
02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:28.440
well get the freeze dried powdered stuff,
you know,
and,
and take that as well.

2847
02:39:28.441 --> 02:39:30.600
That'll help cover your basis.
And right

2848
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:34.650
<v 6>for this game,
meat gave me Ganymede Amit.</v>

2849
02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:38.270
That's what I love,
dude.
I am a dictate to deer meat.

2850
02:39:38.510 --> 02:39:43.070
Venison is fucking spectacular.
I feel better when I eat it.

2851
02:39:43.100 --> 02:39:44.330
It tastes better.

2852
02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:49.040
I feel better about the whole process knowing that this animal live totally wild

2853
02:39:49.041 --> 02:39:52.880
until it got hit by a bullet.
And the food is fucking fantastic for you.

2854
02:39:52.881 --> 02:39:55.280
Lean and rich and vitamins

2855
02:39:55.630 --> 02:39:58.580
<v 5>and these animals are out eating.
You know the other way to get around it,</v>

2856
02:39:58.581 --> 02:40:03.220
if you're eating an animal that's eating tons of varied Greens and really doing

2857
02:40:03.221 --> 02:40:04.320
great things for its health,

2858
02:40:04.330 --> 02:40:07.630
well that'll pass through to the meat that nutritional pass through.

2859
02:40:07.631 --> 02:40:10.090
So that's how a lot of people used to get their nutrition.
Yeah,

2860
02:40:10.091 --> 02:40:12.610
maybe they didn't eat the grass,
but guess what?

2861
02:40:12.611 --> 02:40:14.040
Their animals that they are eating

2862
02:40:14.190 --> 02:40:17.130
<v 0>did eat the grass and they did eat the berries and they did eat all the other</v>

2863
02:40:17.131 --> 02:40:21.000
stuff so that stuff pass through and you get that with game meat or grass fed

2864
02:40:21.001 --> 02:40:25.020
beef.
I have a perfect example.
Two of my chickens,
my chickens eat grass.

2865
02:40:25.021 --> 02:40:28.290
I let my chickens free range during the day and they eat grass in there.

2866
02:40:28.291 --> 02:40:31.550
Yolks are like this bright orange.
He's like,

2867
02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:34.250
he's really rich orange and then I'll go to a diner,

2868
02:40:34.330 --> 02:40:38.610
I'll order some eggs and you need,
he gave you a regular and Ailes is dead.

2869
02:40:38.611 --> 02:40:42.630
Yellow Egg.
I never knew man.
I always knew it.
I thought an egg was an egg.

2870
02:40:42.660 --> 02:40:45.320
Eggs are good for you.
I thought an egg was an egg high in protein,

2871
02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:47.370
lots of essential fatty acids and all that stuff.

2872
02:40:47.640 --> 02:40:51.730
I just thought it was just eggs.
No,
no.
My eggs taste different man.
They,

2873
02:40:51.731 --> 02:40:53.610
these chickens,
first of all it's chickens.

2874
02:40:53.910 --> 02:40:57.600
They live in a yard where they run around and they all live together.

2875
02:40:57.601 --> 02:41:00.750
They have like this little community and they have plenty space and they eat,

2876
02:41:00.850 --> 02:41:03.810
you know,
fucking grass.
And one of them got canc though.

2877
02:41:04.170 --> 02:41:07.020
I don't know who ganged it either.
It was my dog.

2878
02:41:07.740 --> 02:41:11.700
My dog is one suspect.
He might've ate the whole thing cause there's no feathers.

2879
02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:16.080
If it was my dog.
It's very clever.
What do you think at heart?
More likely arc.

2880
02:41:16.170 --> 02:41:19.410
I think a hawk.
Got It.
Cause there are a lot and it was a little dumb one.

2881
02:41:19.770 --> 02:41:22.800
We have a bunch of different kinds of eggs are a bunch of different kinds of egg

2882
02:41:22.801 --> 02:41:23.850
laying,
laying chickens.

2883
02:41:24.180 --> 02:41:27.420
But there's the big difference in the way their food tastes based in their diet.

2884
02:41:27.690 --> 02:41:29.520
If I leave them in their camp,
their pen,

2885
02:41:29.521 --> 02:41:32.490
they're big a house thing and just feed them in there.

2886
02:41:32.580 --> 02:41:35.190
You know they have this big walk in thing.
They got plenty of room.

2887
02:41:35.191 --> 02:41:36.810
Even if I didn't like let them out in the yard,

2888
02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:40.380
there's plenty of room for them to get around,
but their food tastes different.

2889
02:41:40.381 --> 02:41:44.340
The eggs,
they produce taste different.
They don't taste so good.
They look,

2890
02:41:44.341 --> 02:41:45.174
don't look so good.

2891
02:41:45.510 --> 02:41:48.060
They're missing something when they're out there picking in the grass all the

2892
02:41:48.061 --> 02:41:49.080
time.
It just comes back.

2893
02:41:49.081 --> 02:41:52.650
All of these shortcuts that we make and do to our food and think it's not making

2894
02:41:52.651 --> 02:41:55.590
a difference.
It all adds up,
you know,
and all that adds up.

2895
02:41:55.650 --> 02:41:59.130
The closer you can get to,
you know,
the natural state of how you were,

2896
02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:02.850
how we evolved alongside the eat,
the healthier you're going to be,

2897
02:42:02.851 --> 02:42:05.010
the happier you're going to be about yourself and your health.

2898
02:42:05.070 --> 02:42:07.200
I want you to ask yourself,
why is there corn in my shit?

2899
02:42:11.370 --> 02:42:14.820
Why did that go through?
Why?
Where did what happened in my body that it didn't?

2900
02:42:15.180 --> 02:42:17.760
Is that not food?
What's going on here?
Why is that?

2901
02:42:17.970 --> 02:42:21.330
These corns just floating around and went all the way through the whole machine.

2902
02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:25.250
If it came out,
it's corn.
It doesn't even come out,
chewed,
swallow,

2903
02:42:25.251 --> 02:42:28.820
spoonful of corn.
It just comes out looking exactly like corn.

2904
02:42:28.830 --> 02:42:31.290
It's like deflated corn.
Like whatever's in has gone,

2905
02:42:31.291 --> 02:42:34.160
but the outside still there kind of rehydrates else.

2906
02:42:34.580 --> 02:42:38.100
Tough is that stuff except popcorn.
Popcorn seems to go right.
True.

2907
02:42:38.790 --> 02:42:42.600
Popcorn seems to get smashed up and you know,
corn meal,
fine,
everything's good,

2908
02:42:43.170 --> 02:42:47.400
but popcorn or corn,
corn,
corn on the cob.
And got shit comes out weird.

2909
02:42:47.990 --> 02:42:51.450
We shouldn't be eating that,
but yet eat the eat the purple corn.

2910
02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:52.830
That stuff's good for you.
But yet,

2911
02:42:52.831 --> 02:42:56.130
why is corn so yummy and so that with a little butter,

2912
02:42:56.430 --> 02:42:57.480
tell me what's wrong there.

2913
02:42:57.960 --> 02:43:01.110
There's something absolutely delicious about corn with butter.

2914
02:43:01.111 --> 02:43:03.680
Even if you shit it out,
even if it's bad for your heart with a butter,

2915
02:43:03.690 --> 02:43:05.280
a little hint,
a little grass fed butter,

2916
02:43:05.281 --> 02:43:07.380
little Himalayan salt and some non GMO corn.

2917
02:43:07.381 --> 02:43:09.930
You've got a barbecue party so it was blue corn,

2918
02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:14.650
non GMO corn or did they fuck that shit?
They could fuck that shit up too.

2919
02:43:14.651 --> 02:43:17.890
But the purple corn from Peru is really good.

2920
02:43:17.891 --> 02:43:21.250
One of the highest antioxidant levels of any food in the world.

2921
02:43:21.610 --> 02:43:24.640
Can we grow it up here or is it like cocaine?
I don't know.

2922
02:43:24.641 --> 02:43:27.980
I don't think it grows particularly well here.
Damaged super high altitudes.

2923
02:43:27.981 --> 02:43:32.160
So we need to get Monsanto on the fucking GMO.
Yeah,
they'll modify that shit.

2924
02:43:32.170 --> 02:43:33.640
Modify that.
Shits with gross,

2925
02:43:33.641 --> 02:43:36.700
grow it and the Goddamn everglades after they're done with it.
Yeah,

2926
02:43:36.910 --> 02:43:41.680
the girl on the moon and a fucking Frisbee.
All Right,

2927
02:43:41.681 --> 02:43:44.680
ladies and gentlemen,
we're out of time,
but this was awesome as always.

2928
02:43:44.681 --> 02:43:48.460
This is the new year podcast.
So,
uh,
it was kind of a,

2929
02:43:48.461 --> 02:43:50.860
a little on the self-helpy side,
but,
uh,

2930
02:43:50.861 --> 02:43:53.200
I think we do that for our own benefit as well as for yours.

2931
02:43:53.201 --> 02:43:55.810
These are just ideas we bounce around on and you know,

2932
02:43:55.840 --> 02:43:57.310
we're just figuring it out ourselves.

2933
02:43:57.530 --> 02:44:02.080
But it's one of the reasons why we're able to do this is,
uh,

2934
02:44:02.410 --> 02:44:04.540
that you guys are listening that we,
you know,

2935
02:44:04.541 --> 02:44:07.870
we couldn't just sit here by ourselves and have this go out into a vacuum.

2936
02:44:08.050 --> 02:44:10.690
W W we wouldn't,
it wouldn't be the same thing.

2937
02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:15.190
It is much like subatomic particles.
It relies upon the observer.
Absolutely.

2938
02:44:15.191 --> 02:44:18.790
The Observer affects the outcome.
So,
uh,
thank you to you guys.
Yeah,

2939
02:44:18.791 --> 02:44:21.190
you guys are all part of this in some weird way and I don't,

2940
02:44:21.460 --> 02:44:23.470
I don't understand it any more than you understand it.

2941
02:44:23.740 --> 02:44:25.510
Thanks to everybody came out to Vegas this weekend.

2942
02:44:25.511 --> 02:44:29.110
We had a great fucking time and we're going to do more of those big nutty shows

2943
02:44:29.350 --> 02:44:30.131
with Joey Diaz,

2944
02:44:30.131 --> 02:44:33.580
Ari Shaffir and Brian Cowen that there was like the first one that we did at the

2945
02:44:33.581 --> 02:44:35.500
Mirage and it was fucking insanity.
It was,

2946
02:44:35.890 --> 02:44:38.920
it was one of the more fun shows I've ever done.
It was probably the hardest.

2947
02:44:38.921 --> 02:44:43.270
I've laughed in a long fucking time.
Oh my God,
it was fantastic.
Um,

2948
02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:47.020
happy new year everybody.
But remember there is no new year.
It's all bullshit.

2949
02:44:47.050 --> 02:44:50.890
Okay.
You just alive now.
This is the only time that's a real,
if you have kids,

2950
02:44:50.891 --> 02:44:52.150
I get it.
If you have,
you know,

2951
02:44:52.151 --> 02:44:56.590
a needy boyfriend or girlfriend that likes to fucking go,
three,
two,
one,

2952
02:44:57.660 --> 02:44:58.493

2954

2955
02:45:03.430 --> 02:45:04.730

Shit's ridiculous.
