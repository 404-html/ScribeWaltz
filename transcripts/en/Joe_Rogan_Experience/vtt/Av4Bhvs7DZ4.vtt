00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:29.454
<v Speaker 1>I've got to do something.</v>

28
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.321
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

29
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:31.501
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

30
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:31.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

31
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.521
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

32
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:32.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>on Hollywood in the sense that I was in New York and working at the daily show,</v>

34
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:39.840
<v Speaker 1>which is next to the horse stables for central park.</v>

35
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

36
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I should say W it's a great showbiz story.</v>

37
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.111
<v Speaker 1>I guess so,</v>

38
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:43.470
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

39
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.470
<v Speaker 1>It went from being like a PA to the executive producer of the daily show and</v>

40
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking awesome.</v>

41
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

42
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>well it was good.</v>

43
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.060
<v Speaker 1>It was not the,</v>

44
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that that was going to happen.</v>

46
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>I got a job,</v>

47
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do comedy.</v>

48
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do standup,</v>

49
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>but I went to college,</v>

50
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>so I felt weird coming out of college and tell my parents I was just going to be</v>

51
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 1>competing it,</v>

52
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>like yeah,</v>

54
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>remember all that money and stuff.</v>

55
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm just going to tell jokes like I come from like,</v>

56
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>my dad was like an old school Italian guy.</v>

58
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Like he doesn't understand this kind of stuff.</v>

59
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:12.991
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

60
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

61
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.243
<v Speaker 1>What about a job?</v>

62
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.881
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

63
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:15.661
<v Speaker 1>Like get a job.</v>

64
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Like he would have been happier if I said I was going to be a,</v>

65
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>like a mailman or an electrician,</v>

66
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:23.190
<v Speaker 1>like that would have made more sense than a job in TV.</v>

67
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>So we're comedy in general,</v>

68
00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>so I got the job through were and like that could at least justify the love of</v>

69
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

70
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of makes sense.</v>

71
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.961
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

72
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:31.231
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

73
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm working in the serious business.</v>

74
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

75
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Leave television shows were very successful,</v>

76
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>or at least I had to go somewhere.</v>

77
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.903
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what?</v>

78
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a big part of it.</v>

79
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:41.071
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

80
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:41.511
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

81
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:43.220
<v Speaker 1>what do you do when the morning when the alarm was on?</v>

82
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.351
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

83
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:46.270
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to get up in the morning cause you just work at night and comedy</v>

84
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.123
<v Speaker 1>clubs like what?</v>

85
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

86
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>the comics that we know that don't do anything during the,</v>

87
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 1>during the doll.</v>

88
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean they'd just fuck off completely and totally get on stage,</v>

90
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>which I'm always quite jealous of actually.</v>

91
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:57.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

92
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

93
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.340
<v Speaker 1>but I always had that feeling when people go,</v>

94
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>how do you do both?</v>

95
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.391
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

96
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>

97
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.700
<v Speaker 1>once during the day,</v>

98
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:03.271
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

99
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 1>So that's one way to do both though.</v>

100
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:06.121
<v Speaker 1>As I got older,</v>

101
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>I got more tired at night and it's harder to go out and do clubs after the daily</v>

102
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:10.200
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

103
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.561
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

104
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:10.861
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

105
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>It's the hardest thing in the world when you,</v>

106
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 1>when you're on a set,</v>

107
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 1>not the hardest thing in the world.</v>

108
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't look compared to anything else.</v>

109
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 1>It's really easy.</v>

110
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>It's as easy as fuck.</v>

111
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:20.341
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

112
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:21.390
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to work.</v>

113
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:22.051
<v Speaker 1>What I was going to say,</v>

114
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 1>it's the hardest thing in the world to work a full time job and then try to go</v>

115
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:27.620
<v Speaker 1>out and pursue something because you're all your,</v>

116
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>your juice has gone.</v>

117
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>

118
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

119
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>anything you're trying to do that's like athletes that have full time jobs,</v>

120
00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>like fighters at a fulltime jobs.</v>

121
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.491
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

122
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:36.001
<v Speaker 1>that's hard.</v>

123
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's even harder because they have hours of training they have to put in</v>

124
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

125
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>But just when you're done at the end of the day,</v>

126
00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:42.331
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

127
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>You want to get a bite to eat,</v>

128
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.570
<v Speaker 1>watch TV.</v>

129
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to except for your notes and fucking yet or the,</v>

130
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.961
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

131
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:52.100
<v Speaker 1>the other thing was too is still not even at a place where like I walk in with</v>

132
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:52.831
<v Speaker 1>club and they're let go,</v>

133
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>just get right up.</v>

134
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.780
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

135
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.011
<v Speaker 1>usually they're like,</v>

137
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:58.490
<v Speaker 1>why don't you clean up this mess at 1:30 AM you know?</v>

138
00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

139
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.573
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

140
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>so for me it was a lot of,</v>

141
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>it was just I loved doing the time,</v>

142
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you've got to hang out at the club and then,</v>

143
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

145
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

146
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>my bigger problem was because then I have fun hanging out with other comics and</v>

147
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:10.871
<v Speaker 1>I have afterwards,</v>

148
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I have a couple of drinks and cause I know like the harder problem was getting</v>

149
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>up the next morning and be three hours.</v>

150
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

151
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>So that's where I started to have that.</v>

152
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

153
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.361
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

155
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing,</v>

156
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>the thing that was good about my day job is it got me better at comedy,</v>

157
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't really lose the like sort of experience.</v>

158
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>I think I would've gotten on stage what I didn't get by doing it every night for</v>

159
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 1>a while was a,</v>

160
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>like seasoned on stage.</v>

162
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>It took me a little longer to get like comfortable on stage to get back into the</v>

163
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>groove.</v>

164
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

165
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.620
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

166
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

167
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.033
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

168
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.441
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

169
00:03:42.441 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

170
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>it was a good experience.</v>

171
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Pa was fun.</v>

172
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

173
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.850
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those stories that you're going to ruin the expectations for every</v>

174
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 1>fucking kid who,</v>

175
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.450
<v Speaker 1>everybody there obviously I have to say at the daily show because it's been on</v>

176
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 1>so long at John's such a cool guy and like really gave people opportunities</v>

177
00:03:58.271 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

178
00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

179
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 1>I was among the first people to kind of make that journey,</v>

180
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>but now have not been the only one.</v>

181
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.120
<v Speaker 1>That writer there was a PA that's amazing.</v>

182
00:04:08.121 --> 00:04:08.840
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of the EPA,</v>

183
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.830
<v Speaker 1>the eps and peas and stuff where Peter's,</v>

184
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.961
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

185
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:12.500
<v Speaker 1>like people can,</v>

186
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>that's like a farm system almost for good writing and producing.</v>

188
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty cool.</v>

189
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>That's fantastic.</v>

190
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 1>And it's become like for a lot of people how they get the news.</v>

191
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

192
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:23.404
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>

193
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that weird?</v>

194
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Like that?</v>

195
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.690
<v Speaker 1>That's how people get the new John Stewart.</v>

196
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

197
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 1>People tell me that a lot.</v>

198
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.581
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

199
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:30.681
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

200
00:04:30.681 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 1>I guess where I get my news and I get it.</v>

201
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember being in college would go to college,</v>

202
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:35.134
<v Speaker 1>kids get their news.</v>

203
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I didn't even watch the news when I was in college.</v>

204
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:37.691
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

205
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:38.111
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

206
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:38.890
<v Speaker 1>you're in college,</v>

207
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 1>so I guess it's better than nothing.</v>

209
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.561
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

210
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:42.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

211
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 1>I always tell people it's a good place to start to get interested in a topic and</v>

212
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 1>then go off and do your own research or whatever you want.</v>

213
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Because when people get into political debates off of like emails and like daily</v>

214
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>show clips and they were like,</v>

215
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:55.690
<v Speaker 1>that's actually not true.</v>

216
00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:55.961
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

217
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:56.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

218
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:59.350
<v Speaker 1>they don't have like a real understanding of each story necessarily,</v>

219
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

220
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

221
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.631
<v Speaker 1>It's weird thing,</v>

222
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:01.991
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

223
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>When you're,</v>

224
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.951
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

225
00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:07.951
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing a television show that's also an educational show and also has</v>

226
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 1>like a very progressive point of view are very,</v>

227
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.710
<v Speaker 1>what you would think of when you think of John Stewart is like very intelligent,</v>

228
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:15.544
<v Speaker 1>very progressive,</v>

229
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 1>mocking of both the left and the right when they do ridiculous shit.</v>

230
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

231
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.000
<v Speaker 1>But it's gotta be funny for sure.</v>

232
00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a hard job.</v>

233
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

234
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Well it's really hard for him.</v>

235
00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 1>For me it was a lot easier cause I got to watch him do it.</v>

236
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

237
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.351
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

238
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing about John that's amazing is he does all,</v>

239
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 1>he's involved from 9:00 AM through the end of the show obviously when he hosts</v>

240
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:36.700
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

241
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.533
<v Speaker 1>But in other words,</v>

242
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.860
<v Speaker 1>she so intimately involved and he's so smart and so sharp that like when he's in</v>

243
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:42.694
<v Speaker 1>the chair,</v>

244
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>I never worried about a joke not working because even when they didn't work,</v>

245
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 1>he just would like call an audible and his own head and then like remember a</v>

246
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:54.640
<v Speaker 1>joke from like the 90 and meeting that he liked that didn't make the script and</v>

247
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>throw that in or it's pretty amazing to watch him to sitting in the studio</v>

248
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:03.101
<v Speaker 1>because he'll change a joke in prompter as a prompter scrolling and then later</v>

249
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:04.890
<v Speaker 1>there's a call back to the joke.</v>

250
00:06:04.891 --> 00:06:08.980
<v Speaker 1>He changed and he remembers the change the callback or skip the call back.</v>

251
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.820
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

252
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sitting there with the script watching the prompter going,</v>

253
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

254
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

255
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.761
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

256
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:14.940
<v Speaker 1>here comes the callback.</v>

257
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Like we're screwed,</v>

258
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

259
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.230
<v Speaker 1>and then he's just jumps it or,</v>

260
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

261
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.020
<v Speaker 1>or tags it with the jokey.</v>

262
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

263
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

264
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 1>It's really like watching</v>

265
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 1>for that long too.</v>

266
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.181
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

267
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking smooth.</v>

268
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 1>He's so used to that Gig.</v>

269
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Like for Jimmy Fallon or me for Seth Meyers who tried the same sort of an</v>

270
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 1>impromptu ad Lib.</v>

271
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 1>They might pull it off,</v>

272
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 1>but Jon Stewart has been doing it forever.</v>

273
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

274
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Forever and ever.</v>

275
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.391
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

276
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

277
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 1>And he also,</v>

278
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:43.514
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

279
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

280
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

281
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.640
<v Speaker 1>and he also just knows a lot.</v>

282
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>What does a good comic too.</v>

283
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

284
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.791
<v Speaker 1>He's a great comic,</v>

285
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:51.520
<v Speaker 1>but he also just knows,</v>

286
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 1>he understands comedy in a way that,</v>

287
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.611
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

288
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:56.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure those,</v>

289
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.411

293
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 1>I just never worked with them in that capacity.</v>

294
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:03.350
<v Speaker 1>So I know John understands it,</v>

295
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:04.190
<v Speaker 1>like music,</v>

296
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.053
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

297
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.481
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

298
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:06.111
<v Speaker 1>that won't work.</v>

299
00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:06.944
<v Speaker 1>This will work.</v>

300
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

301
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.000
<v Speaker 1>and people go,</v>

302
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 1>how do you know something's going to work before you try it?</v>

303
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

304
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.710
<v Speaker 1>you just kind of know.</v>

305
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.201
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

306
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:13.040
<v Speaker 1>You just kind of know.</v>

307
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.191
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

308
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 1>he also has a very specific voice.</v>

309
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:18.140
<v Speaker 1>He knows his voice and his style of delivery.</v>

310
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.033
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

311
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.431
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

312
00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:19.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

313
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:20.151
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

314
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:20.600
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

315
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascinating show because it's very political,</v>

316
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.670
<v Speaker 1>but yet very funny.</v>

317
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.590
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

318
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.110
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't sacrifice like going for funny.</v>

319
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

320
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Like to try to look like less silly or try to look dignified.</v>

321
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:36.740
<v Speaker 1>He's not trying to monologue it.</v>

322
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:37.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

323
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:37.131
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

324
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:38.690
<v Speaker 1>he's just making this stuff.</v>

325
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 1>It's funny as you can and sometimes he gets extremely animated and it's fucking</v>

326
00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:42.541
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

327
00:07:42.541 --> 00:07:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

328
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.610
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

329
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

330
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.043
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

331
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.520
<v Speaker 1>he's versatile in that sense.</v>

332
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Like he can really do and he tied comedy.</v>

333
00:07:48.381 --> 00:07:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

334
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.543
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

335
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.330
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

336
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.163
<v Speaker 1>as far as it,</v>

337
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:51.891
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

338
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 1>cause it really is,</v>

339
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 1>and people,</v>

340
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.160
<v Speaker 1>there's always bothers people so much that was wanting to go,</v>

341
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:55.341
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

342
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:57.770
<v Speaker 1>what they think the daily show us that can agenda.</v>

343
00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.041
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

344
00:07:58.041 --> 00:07:59.420
<v Speaker 1>we're all sitting around in a circle be like,</v>

345
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:00.780
<v Speaker 1>how do we screw the right?</v>

346
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

347
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.511
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

348
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:03.170
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

349
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

350
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 1>people don't believe that.</v>

351
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:05.090
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>

352
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:05.241
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

353
00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:07.150
<v Speaker 1>you're just hiding behind the fact that it's a comedy show.</v>

354
00:08:07.151 --> 00:08:07.341
<v Speaker 1>He'd go,</v>

355
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

356
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Doing comedy is really hard.</v>

357
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.090
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to hide.</v>

358
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Like we still have to take the stories.</v>

359
00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:13.220
<v Speaker 1>We still tried to get everything right.</v>

360
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:15.410
<v Speaker 1>We have people who fact check.</v>

361
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy there named Adam maciato coffee was like just a guru of</v>

362
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:23.540
<v Speaker 1>information and we'll come in to the rewrite room between rehearsal and the show</v>

363
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 1>after we change a joke and I go,</v>

364
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.300
<v Speaker 1>you can't say this this way cause it's statistically inaccurate to like</v>

365
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.380
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'm like,</v>

366
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:30.861
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

367
00:08:30.861 --> 00:08:31.694
<v Speaker 1>no one's going to care.</v>

368
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that,</v>

369
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying it's not even,</v>

370
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.690
<v Speaker 1>it was a we're,</v>

371
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:36.530
<v Speaker 1>we're so we're,</v>

372
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:39.150
<v Speaker 1>we really fact check stuff that goes out but the,</v>

373
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:39.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

374
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 1>so it really,</v>

375
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:43.250
<v Speaker 1>a big part of the day is figuring out how to tell the story,</v>

376
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:46.070
<v Speaker 1>the narrative and then adding the jokes is why you have,</v>

377
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:46.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

378
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.540
<v Speaker 1>writers and guys like John,</v>

379
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:48.374
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

380
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.520
<v Speaker 1>then you can pile on the funny,</v>

381
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 1>but funny is the most important thing.</v>

382
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.070
<v Speaker 1>There really is.</v>

383
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 1>That's what's so fun.</v>

384
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.140
<v Speaker 1>That's why I stayed so long because it's not like a,</v>

385
00:08:55.141 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

386
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

387
00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

388
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>there's no like movement happening.</v>

389
00:08:58.231 --> 00:08:59.280
<v Speaker 1>There was just a comedy show.</v>

390
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why everybody who gets so attached to it,</v>

391
00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:02.881
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy.</v>

392
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:07.881
<v Speaker 1>It's like they want it almost to be more ideologically driven than it is.</v>

393
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:08.790
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

394
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:09.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like people would,</v>

395
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.730
<v Speaker 1>they would want it if he said something ridiculous,</v>

396
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 1>supportive and supportive of Obama,</v>

397
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.520
<v Speaker 1>they would like it.</v>

398
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

399
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>But if Obama fucks up,</v>

400
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:17.430
<v Speaker 1>he goes after him too all the time.</v>

401
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

402
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the thing.</v>

403
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

404
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 1>The show really became what it is or what people think of it as now during the</v>

405
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:25.020
<v Speaker 1>Bush administration.</v>

406
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:30.140
<v Speaker 1>So I think people really associated with being this like hardcore left wing a</v>

407
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 1>show and it definitely slants laughed.</v>

408
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:38.181
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's hard sometimes for it not to within in comedy because everything</v>

409
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.770
<v Speaker 1>that's when you're pointing out some things are just straight up absurd.</v>

410
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

411
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.790
<v Speaker 1>It's hard sometimes not to seem left cause you're throwing away like,</v>

412
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.211
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

413
00:09:48.211 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

414
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.240
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's what people go.</v>

415
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Why don't people do a right wing daily show?</v>

416
00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:53.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

417
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.900
<v Speaker 1>it's not really a left or a right thing.</v>

418
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:58.290
<v Speaker 1>It's just a lot of times comedy is dismissive of people taking themselves too</v>

419
00:09:58.291 --> 00:09:58.891
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

420
00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:03.180
<v Speaker 1>And Conservatives have a tendency to take things very seriously.</v>

421
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:03.811
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

422
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:05.430
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what they are.</v>

423
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:06.870
<v Speaker 1>They're conservative,</v>

424
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.700
<v Speaker 1>exacting,</v>

425
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.331
<v Speaker 1>more centered.</v>

426
00:10:08.331 --> 00:10:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Comic by nature is the guy sitting in the back of the classroom being like,</v>

427
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.781
<v Speaker 1>look at his dick.</v>

428
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:13.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

429
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like you don't really care.</v>

430
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.020
<v Speaker 1>You know what the person's saying,</v>

431
00:10:16.021 --> 00:10:18.210
<v Speaker 1>you're just finding places to get a laugh.</v>

432
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.710
<v Speaker 1>And I think so for us,</v>

433
00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 1>like when the left does sort of things,</v>

434
00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:22.350
<v Speaker 1>which is also quite frequent,</v>

435
00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:23.910
<v Speaker 1>like occupy Wall Street.</v>

436
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

437
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Was a perfect example of my favorite times at the daily show.</v>

438
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Well were like ripping the left and new asshole and the audience,</v>

439
00:10:30.341 --> 00:10:31.290
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm in the studio,</v>

440
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:32.124
<v Speaker 1>we're used to be.</v>

441
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.270
<v Speaker 1>And the audience is like,</v>

442
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:37.010
<v Speaker 1>what are you guys doing man John,</v>

443
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 1>this is our movement man.</v>

444
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:38.671
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>

445
00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 1>and they'll let you know I don't like they,</v>

446
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.700
<v Speaker 1>if they zip up their zip,</v>

447
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:42.091
<v Speaker 1>he's over there.</v>

448
00:10:42.091 --> 00:10:43.740
<v Speaker 1>John Stewart for president t shirts.</v>

449
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

450
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

451
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.500
<v Speaker 1>And for me it was like we crush those dudes and then I'd go to the desk between</v>

452
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:50.370
<v Speaker 1>commercials and we'd be like,</v>

453
00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:51.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

454
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:51.903
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

455
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

456
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.050
<v Speaker 1>it's a standups mentality.</v>

457
00:10:54.051 --> 00:10:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Like do you feel the crowd?</v>

458
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:55.321
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

459
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I just came back from Madison,</v>

460
00:10:56.521 --> 00:10:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Wisconsin this weekend.</v>

461
00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.190
<v Speaker 1>And it's an amazing city.</v>

462
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

463
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.370
<v Speaker 1>the club is awesome.</v>

464
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:03.540
<v Speaker 1>The shows were so fun,</v>

465
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.950
<v Speaker 1>but they were,</v>

466
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 1>it was grown.</v>

467
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:05.850
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

468
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.400
<v Speaker 1>there were groans from the crowd on certain things I would say,</v>

469
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:09.960
<v Speaker 1>cause it was this college town,</v>

470
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:10.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

471
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.690
<v Speaker 1>And colleges now are really at like,</v>

472
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.050
<v Speaker 1>I know that's like a,</v>

473
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 1>a taboo right wing thing to say,</v>

474
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:21.141
<v Speaker 1>but there's a left wing political correctness in college now that is an extreme</v>

475
00:11:21.721 --> 00:11:22.410
<v Speaker 1>extreme.</v>

476
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.680
<v Speaker 1>And I remember like 10 years ago doing a college gig is very different than now.</v>

477
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:26.960
<v Speaker 1>You make a joke about being like,</v>

478
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.150
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

479
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.660
<v Speaker 1>And that was happening in Madison and there's,</v>

480
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

481
00:11:31.501 --> 00:11:32.071
<v Speaker 1>as a comic,</v>

482
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:32.281
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

483
00:11:32.281 --> 00:11:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Like you feel that from the crowd and you go,</v>

484
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:34.531
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

485
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:35.340

486
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

487
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.240

488
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:36.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.890

495
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.310
<v Speaker 1>We were going after Hillary in Oh eight same thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

499
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Doing what we do and making fun of people who were in charge,</v>

500
00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:50.700
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
