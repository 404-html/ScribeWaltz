1
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.180
So your new meal,

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.100
it seems like it goes right.
Yup.
So it wasn't new mail.
What are we doing?

3
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.840
Trans Care People?
Yes.
The Joe Rogan experience podcast tonight.
Tonight.

4
00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:21.260
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Pasadena Ice House should be getting crazy.

5
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.850
We got Ian Edwards is going to be up a Duncan Trussell be there,

6
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.210

We're trying to get Brody,
so tex protein,

7
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.800
tell him invited and I'll give a live update.
Pleasure.

8
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.680
Uh,
Brody can't.
Thanks for a lot of a bitch.
I got somebody else.
Yeah,

9
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.110
I tried.
I tried to call Todd glass so they didn't call us back.

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.300
Maybe talk about as busy,
maybe talk glasses.
Too important for us.

11
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.110
They reached out of the country type glasses being hilarious.
Always hilarious.

12
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.050
It's fucking awesome.
It's,
we've got to get them in here.
It's an oversight.

13
00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:57.410
We got to get Patton Oswald in there too of hockey.
So police harass him.

14
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.460
I'm dumb.
Don't really.
But yes,
do it.
Uh,
the jury of the spirits podcast.
Oh,

15
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.670
go to [inaudible] dot.
TV If you want to find out.

16
00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:08.810
Brian's got shows coming up in Ohio,
I believe,
November 11th and sold out.
Right.

17
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:09.760
But you added sorrows.

18
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.120
We have November 8th in Dayton and November 10th and Columbus and there's more

19
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:17.080
shows being added and Tommy Segura is on the line up to it.

20
00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:19.010
And if you never seen Tom in this,
what I said yesterday,

21
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:21.020
I really think he's one of the best comics in the country.

22
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.080
He's a fucking awesome guy too.
And he's just hilarious.

23
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:26.630
He's really good right now.
I mean,
he's,
he was always really good,

24
00:01:26.631 --> 00:01:28.740
but he's even better now.
Last time I saw him,

25
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:32.170
it's was just fucking murdering at the Ice House.
Will be the ice house tonight.

26
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.740
10 o'clock,
$15 show this weekend.
Uh,

27
00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:38.420
I think it's totally sold out.
Sold out.

28
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.880
They were begging me to get tickets for them and I'm like,
God,

29
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.390
what am I supposed in Minneapolis pitch?
Sorry.
We'll next place.

30
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.480
Next time we'll do it.
We'll just get a bigger place.
We'll be back though.

31
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.910
Don't sweat it.
Um,
and um,

32
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.240
then of course the end of the world show December 21st,
2012,

33
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.430
those dates of hoping that that one's on live nation and you could find it.

34
00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:02.630
I'll find it on my Twitter feed somewhere.
Don't be lazy.
Just Google it.
Don't go,

35
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.350
don't get scalped but it's me,
honey,
honey band,
Doug,

36
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:11.150
Stan hope and Joey Diaz.
This shit is going to be epic,
Ladies and gentlemen.

37
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.440
All right.
Just,
just imagine that experience and if the mines are right,

38
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.550
we partied together,

39
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.660
we party together while the earth gets hit by a giant asteroid or the aliens

40
00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:21.710
land or

41
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
Kim Kardashians becomes president or whatever the fuck's going to happen that's

42
00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:27.750
going to make it go wrong.
Uh,

43
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.080
we're also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com oh,

44
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:33.170
I got new t shirts into the higher primates shirts are and the people keep

45
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:34.970
asking and I got some new designs that we're working on.

46
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.600
Two killer wants to Mike's Mike Maxwell pieces that are awesome.

47
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.870
More monkey related bullshit.
Ladies and gentlemen,

48
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.980
the higher-primate.com is the name of my tee shirt company does.
They're all,

49
00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:49.700
that's all mine.
That's why it's so childish.
It's why it's monkeys and mushrooms,

50
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.180
but it a few aliens and there's like monkeys playing chess with aliens.

51
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.810
I like how your,
your,
your monkeys and aliens and I'm cats and boots.
Yeah,

52
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.740
we're a mess.
Whereas if we have a cartoon,
you're a monkey and I'm a cat.
Okay,

53
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:06.120
let's do it right.
Well where's the alien for them?
Uh,
that could be our guest.

54
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.110
The alien to us there does the overlord,
uh,

55
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:16.111
on it.com o n n I t just got in new BLENDTEC blenders.

56
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:20.560
And if you go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash blender and you pick up one

57
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:21.394
of these blenders,

58
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.640
you also get a free can of hemp force protein powder,

59
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:30.850
which is a amazing protein powder that we sell.

60
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.090
That is the best quality hand parts that you can buy.

61
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.220
It also has maca in it and has raw cocoa in it.
And uh,
it's the shit's not cheap,

62
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.020
but it's fucking delicious.

63
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.410
And one of the reasons why it's not cheap because our government is a fucking

64
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:49.330
mess and they don't let you grow hemp.
It's,
it's really silly hemp you can buy.

65
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.360
This is how it works.
You can buy hemp,

66
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.540
you can bring into the country you,
once you get it into the country,

67
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:58.030
you can sell it,
but you can't grow it here.

68
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.880
It's really an insult to the American farmer and the American entrepreneur.

69
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.540
Someone who would want to do that,

70
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:07.180
who would want to open up the hemp farm and grow some hemp,

71
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:09.780
which by the way is completely non-psychoactive.

72
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.210
There's zero in it that can get you high.
It doesn't get you high.

73
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:16.730
It's not what it is.
It's a totally different thing.
It's a textile.
It's,

74
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.430
it's an oil.
It's,
you know,
it's,
it's seeds that you can,
you know,

75
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.730
make salads with where it's very high in protein and high in amino acids.

76
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.050
It's like an amazing plant.

77
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:28.690
There's all sorts of great stuff you can get out of hemp,

78
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.720
but it's illegal because we're silly pitches.

79
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.190
This country is run by silly pitches,
period.
That if you don't correct that,

80
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:38.590
you're silly bitch.
It's just,
there's no getting around that.

81
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:42.220
It's the dumbest law ever because it's not even a drug law.
It's a law.

82
00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:44.860
About a useful plant that's related to a drug.

83
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:48.610
It's like arresting you because your cousin's a fucking crook.
It's stupid.

84
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.740
It doesn't make any sense.
But,
so that's the deal with,
with hemp force.
Uh,

85
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.490
if you get a new BLENDTEC blender,

86
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:58.660
and I've been talking about these Kale shakes that I drink every morning and a

87
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:00.250
lot of people,
uh,
who have tried it,

88
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:04.720
have really found some great benefits from it.
The way it makes you feel,

89
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.490
you feel so clean,

90
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:09.130
you feel like you have all these fucking nutrients in your body.
It's like,

91
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.700
besides vitamins mean vitamins and supplements are important,

92
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:17.180
but what's really important is nutrient dense foods.
You know,
you're really shit,

93
00:05:17.181 --> 00:05:22.180
drank a lot of water and eat green leafy vegetables and the best way to eat it

94
00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:25.810
for me as these Kale shakes I have every day and I do it now with a Blendtec

95
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:27.370
blender,
it's the best one we can find.

96
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.030
And we sell it quite a bit cheaper than the manufacturer.

97
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.040
Retail as a manufacturer retails like almost $200 more than what we sell it for.

98
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.100
We tried to sell you the best shit possible at reasonable prices.

99
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.130
It's not easy to do the the kettle bells for instance.

100
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.090
Those are hard to sell cheap because we're sending you fucking giant metal

101
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:49.240
objects.
They're like really heavy,
but they last forever.

102
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.600
They're the best quality we could possibly get and we sell them in a very

103
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:55.480
reasonable rate and we,
we guarantee everything we have,

104
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:58.820
especially the supplements you,
a lot of people,
they have a,

105
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:02.630
a lot of doubts about supplements.
People think certain supplements are placebos.

106
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.400
I don't want anybody ever feeling ripped off.
So if you buy anything from on it,

107
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.840
any supplement you have 30 days or rather,
the first 30 pills that you buy,

108
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.860
there's 100% money back guarantee.
If you take it and you don't like it,

109
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:18.510
you say this,
you don't even have to return the product.
You just say,
this ain't,

110
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.830
this isn't doing anything for me.
That is a,

111
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.150
how convinced we are that we're selling only the best quality ingredients that

112
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:28.460
are definitely beneficial for people.
And B,

113
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.750
how we go into this in the spirit of not ever wanting anybody to ever feel

114
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:34.370
ripped off.
No one's trying to rip you off.

115
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:38.660
We're trying to sell you the best shit possible that I use on a daily basis,

116
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.250
whether it's Alpha brain,

117
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:44.810
which is a blend of cognitive enhancers that I find to be fucking awesome video

118
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:49.090
game dudes are in love with that shit.
Now I'm getting a lot of people from,
uh,

119
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.840
the pool playing world Max,
I believe,

120
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:54.140
started taking Alpha brain and he's letting people know about it and people have

121
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:57.530
been asking me about it.
Poker players are huge on that shit.

122
00:06:57.531 --> 00:07:00.260
There's a bunch of poker players who were sponsored by,
by on it.

123
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:01.950
They're just huge believers,
uh,

124
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.830
cause its nutrients that enhance your brain's ability to fire correctly,

125
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:10.610
to come up with answers quick to just to,
to work and be smooth.

126
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.520
And it's not a drug,
it's not a speedy thing.

127
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:16.580
It's not anything that's gonna make you feel like shit when you come off of it.

128
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:19.100
It's not addictive.
It's a nutrient.
Because you know,

129
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.010
the other question that people have about hemp force protein powder will make me

130
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:24.170
test positive for marijuana.
No,
it will not.

131
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.940
But poppy seed bagels will make you test positive for heroin.
That's a fact.

132
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.810
That's weird,
but that's fact.
Totally unrelated.
All right.

133
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.730
Can you sell some kettlebells?
Get some fucking battle.

134
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:37.970
Rob's become all manly and shit and if you want to buy some supplements,

135
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:39.230
if you use a code name,
Rogan,

136
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:43.790
you will save 10% off any and all them bitches.
Okay.

137
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.670
All right.
Victor Conte is here.
Ladies and gentlemen,

138
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.750
we're going to get to the bottom of a lot of serious shit in the sports world.

139
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.040
Hit The music.
Brian,

140
00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.980
the Joe Rogan experience

141
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.020
<v 0>my day.
Joe Rogan podcast by night</v>

142
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.590
<v 1>never feels real to the music place and it feels like we're really doing this.</v>

143
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.920
Thank you,
sir,
for coming on the podcast,
sir.
I really appreciate it.
You know,

144
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.520
you're a very controversial figure for people who don't know,

145
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.040
you're the guy who was a,
correct me if I'm wrong,
you were the head ball coach.

146
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:22.780
Is that the correct way to spell it or say it balco you were at the head of the,

147
00:08:22.781 --> 00:08:23.260
uh,

148
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.930
Balco labs that were making these undetectable steroids and you were a hooking

149
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.860
athletes up and then advising them how to beat the system.
And,
uh,
how'd you,

150
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:32.830
how'd you get involved in that?

151
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.030
<v 2>You know,
my life mantra Joe is,
is if it's not fun,
I don't do it.</v>

152
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:42.390
It was fun.
So I was having fun.
Right.
It was a,

153
00:08:42.391 --> 00:08:46.820
the challenge of being in the trenches and,
uh,
you know,

154
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.720
being involved in a number of projects and a number of sports and going after

155
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:53.660
those historic records.
Was it a fun,

156
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:57.270
because you were sorta cheating the system?
Like,
was that part of the fun of it?

157
00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:02.150
They were being naughty?
You know,
it was more about,
uh,

158
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.750
previous to that I had developed a product called Zma that had made a

159
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:10.470
significant amount of money.
And I think like anyone else that,
um,

160
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.580
got to a point where they didn't have to worry about paying the mortgage and so

161
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:18.960
on,
I,
uh,
decided what is it that I really liked to do?

162
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.000
And that was,
uh,
being in the trenches and help athletes and,

163
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.520
and,
uh,
try to do historic thing.

164
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.300
So whether it be go to the Superbowl with teams or go to world championships or

165
00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:32.830
Olympics or whatever it was a,

166
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:38.130
we would set specific goals like the Tim Montgomery project called project world

167
00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:42.390
record.
We set out,
um,
I recruited and hired a bunch of people,

168
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:45.430
including Ben Johnson's,
coach,
Charlie Francis,
to uh,

169
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.680
to create the world's fastest human is one of the projects that we had.

170
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.010
And we did end up eventually doing that piece is Christ.

171
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.850
So you looked at it as sort of a science project sort of a thing.

172
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.930
The challenge and the fun and excitement a lot of people thought because it was

173
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:05.460
an IRS led investigation that it was all about the money at absolutely the

174
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:07.540
farthest thing from the truth.
Uh,

175
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:12.570
ultimately I pled to probably many consider the smallest money laundering case

176
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:16.560
and the history of the United States in an amount of $100.

177
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.450
And how long they put you in jail for that.

178
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.780
I spent four months in a minimum security prison camp,
uh,

179
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.700
where they were smoking weed and,
and uh,
no.

180
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.330
Oh yeah.
The,
the,
this uh,
talk about,
uh,
uh,

181
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.580
made me Syrians disen rat on them cause then they'll,

182
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.240
they'll tighten down with people that are in there right now.
Well,

183
00:10:39.241 --> 00:10:42.140
I told you earlier before you started that,
uh,

184
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.330
one of your friends that you had on your show,
Tommy Chong,

185
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.450
he's already ratted on him.
In fact,
he ratted on him,

186
00:10:48.451 --> 00:10:51.930
on the Dave Letterman show when I was in.
Oh,
did he really?
Damn,
man,

187
00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:55.200
you got to keep that quiet.
If it's an easy jail,
you know,

188
00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:56.610
you don't want to fuck it up for people.

189
00:10:56.611 --> 00:10:58.830
There's a lot of angry republicans out there.
They're like,
wait,

190
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.380
it's fucking painful.
They're supposed to bring your jail.

191
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.380
It's supposed to be grand punished.
How do we keep our kids safe?

192
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.770
It was a sports complex.
Was it really?

193
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.440
So you just worked out and hung out and slow,
you know,

194
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:13.840
to make a long story short,
the first morning when I woke up and I,

195
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.860
it was kind of a university campus like setting and I walked out and in the

196
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:23.790
middle of the courtyard,
it was a huge sign and it said,
Sports Complex,

197
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.830
uh,
basketball,
football,
baseball,
soccer,
botchy ball,

198
00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:33.570
volleyball,
handball.
Wow.
And I looked,
uh,
you know,

199
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.381
around and I,

200
00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:39.360
there was about 500 guys there and they all had all sorts of equipment,
you know,

201
00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:44.190
somewhere there was a soccer game and a and a baseball game and all going on.

202
00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:47.060
And then,
uh,
I looked over and I saw the,
uh,

203
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.350
the rec center and I walked over to that and walked in and there were six pool

204
00:11:52.351 --> 00:11:55.690
tables and foosball tables,
ping pong tables.

205
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.560
And then I went through this door and it was this huge music department.

206
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:04.000
Three different musical groups were,
were practicing and,
and I said,
well,

207
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.510
do they have concerts here?
Oh yeah,
we have a routine on Friday nights.

208
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:11.690
We have the bands playing,
we have concerts outside.
That's

209
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.280
sounds awesome.
This is my first,
you know,
10 minutes out on the,
uh,

210
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.750
on the compound.
I started walking around with some guys around the,
uh,

211
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.160
the walking track and I went,
I said,
are they smoking weed here?
I said,
yeah,

212
00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:28.660
what's some weak?
Can't go fuck.
I said,
I listen,

213
00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:31.070
I don't want anything to do with this kind of stuff.
I don't know.

214
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.890
You don't get in any,
any more trouble.
And I'm already in.
Did they,

215
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.930
do they test people?
How could you smoke weed if the,
I mean,
don't they test them?

216
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:42.910
Well,
first of all,
there's no fences around the place.
Right.
Every 200 feet,

217
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:46.810
they have a,
a sign on a steak that says out of bounds.

218
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.970
I got there in December 1st of 2005,
uh,

219
00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:56.260
that Christmas,
about 25 guys just walked up to the freeway and have their,

220
00:12:56.261 --> 00:13:00.250
the road and,
and have their families pick them up and they left.
Wow.

221
00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:02.200
So it was kind of an honor system,
but yeah.

222
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.290
Anything that you wanted a alcohol,

223
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.430
any and every type you wanted was $20 for eight ounces.
They had math,

224
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:12.760
they had steroids.
I,

225
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.190
if I,
you know,

226
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.470
I didn't take me long to figure out that they had several really nice looking

227
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:25.690
female correction officers there,
you know,
hair done up and you know,

228
00:13:25.691 --> 00:13:29.500
big chest and it was kind of stunning to me in the guy said,
listen,

229
00:13:29.501 --> 00:13:33.340
do you want some action?
Wait a minute,
that's awesome.

230
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:37.810
Telling me the straight scoop.
The female corrections officers were also hookers.

231
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.610
My understanding is on average they were making 30,000 a month.

232
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.980
You're going to jail.
You want me to do to try and go to jail or

233
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.590
do the fat baggy coats that hate their wives.

234
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.670
It's like gimme near a pool table and it's fucking play basketball with the
boys.

235
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.870
Let's all get arrested together please.
I swear to God,

236
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.320
I swear to God the guy and that they have cubes.

237
00:14:02.321 --> 00:14:06.280
It's a 12 by 12 concrete block that is six feet high,
not cells.

238
00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:07.420
They just have an open door.

239
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:12.750
And this young kid came in that same first day that I was there and my a QB was

240
00:14:13.331 --> 00:14:17.470
a guy named eval was his name and he said Eva and I have to do something bad

241
00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:19.450
cause cause I'm scheduled to go home tomorrow.

242
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:25.150
I said your skin has to go home and you,
you want to stay here?
He said,

243
00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:28.630
yeah,
if I go home I got to start paying rent.
Oh Wow.

244
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.230
Well that really does happen and people write to become really
institutionalized.

245
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.260
There's these people that they go to jail for a long time when they become like

246
00:14:35.261 --> 00:14:39.730
almost programmed to have a real hard time adjusting.
Well the,
the,

247
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:44.020
the amazing part of the story is is that the federal taxpayers were paying

248
00:14:44.021 --> 00:14:46.670
$100,000 a day for me to be in there.

249
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:51.320
100,000 for you just yeah,
you,
ABC Nightline news.

250
00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:53.770
Martin Bashir announced that night that I went in there,

251
00:14:53.771 --> 00:14:57.260
they had a special and he said that they had spent investigating and prosecuting

252
00:14:57.261 --> 00:15:01.490
me.
Of course I was the first one in,
they'd spent 12 point $7 million.

253
00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:04.630
So divide that by 120 days.
It's 100 grand.
Yeah.

254
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:05.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

255
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:09.720
It gets really weird when it gets to these a performance enhancing drug trials,

256
00:15:09.721 --> 00:15:11.740
like they go way out of bounds.
It's,

257
00:15:11.741 --> 00:15:15.910
it's really interesting how we just sort of accept that,
you know,
uh,
like we,

258
00:15:15.911 --> 00:15:16.744
we this,

259
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:21.450
these congressional hearings that they have for perjury about fucking steroids

260
00:15:21.451 --> 00:15:23.100
in baseball.
Like really?

261
00:15:23.101 --> 00:15:25.920
Is that what we're using congress four in the middle of two wars,

262
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.010
we're going to make sure that some guy wasn't on growth.
You know,

263
00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:31.140
like what the fuck is wrong with people?

264
00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:35.100
It's really strange that they concentrate on it so much,
you know,

265
00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:38.970
and then they make it this massive deal.
It's certainly a debatable issue.

266
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.210
There's no question about it.
But the,

267
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.540
the prevalence of all sorts of different things that are enhancing performance

268
00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:49.650
available at every single vitamin store all over the country.

269
00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:54.270
They're there all the time.
And those are legal.
So because they're legal,
you say,

270
00:15:54.271 --> 00:15:57.810
well that's okay.
Well their performance enhancing drugs,
okay,
these are,

271
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.360
these are compounds,
molecules,
these are different.

272
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.540
There's a bunch of different things he could buy at GNC and then we'll fucking

273
00:16:03.541 --> 00:16:05.880
help you recover faster.
They will help you get stronger.

274
00:16:05.881 --> 00:16:09.420
They will give you more testosterone.
They just will.
They will.
These are legal.

275
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:14.340
They exist.
So the weirdness of deciding that,

276
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.490
you know,
Roger Clemens shouldn't be taking growth and if he is taken growth,

277
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.010
he should tell the truth about it.
And if he doesn't tell the truth about it,

278
00:16:20.011 --> 00:16:23.490
we're going to drag you in front of fucking Congress.
Like,
Whoa,

279
00:16:23.491 --> 00:16:27.720
you guys took it too far.
He's a fucking baseball player.
He's a baseball player.

280
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.620
You're mad that he didn't tell the truth about a,

281
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:35.130
about a hormone that that makes him better at age 40.
Come on man,

282
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.130
what the fuck are we wasting our money on?
This is ridiculous.

283
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.920
It doesn't make any sense that they would spend so much money doing that.

284
00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:46.800
Did you start off using steroids with athletes or did you slowly work into it?

285
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.020
<v 2>I was a musician for many years.
I played the bass with um,</v>

286
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.050
a group called tower power and also thereafter with the jazz pianist,

287
00:16:57.051 --> 00:16:57.861
Herbie Hancock.

288
00:16:57.861 --> 00:17:02.861
And I made 17 different cds that were in the store are still available and,

289
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.610
and uh,
I was looking for a way to get off the road and into,

290
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:12.670
in 1983 I was 33 at the time and uh,

291
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.090
my cousin's roommate was a guy that had bought this,

292
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:22.310
it's called an ICP is the acronym inductively coupled plasma atomic emissions

293
00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:24.560
spectrometer.
I see.
Get Tower power plan there.

294
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.590
You can just call it as the same picket that I was in the bandwidth.

295
00:17:27.591 --> 00:17:31.040
There's my cousin Bruce who was you guys.
He's the,
uh,

296
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.900
can we that Lenny is the um,
well let's,

297
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.490
in fact Lenny Williams just sang the national anthem with the giants came last

298
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.840
night and forgot the words.
Where are you in this?

299
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:45.050
Let me say this.
May or may not have been the period ramen.
The band,

300
00:17:45.051 --> 00:17:46.820
I can't tell these are all the same guys,

301
00:17:46.821 --> 00:17:49.470
but this may have been a bit before I joined the band.

302
00:17:49.471 --> 00:17:53.490
I don't see unknots Rocco is playing here.
The original bass player.
I,

303
00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:58.290
this is the guy that I replaced.
That's a huge band.
10.
There were 10 guys.

304
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:03.030
Do you guys want us to tore it up on the road?
Had a lot of fun.
I bet you did.

305
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.760
I had a lot of fun.
So you went from that,
how do you go from that to,

306
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:11.000
so I was looking them for a way to make money and uh,
this guy,
Jack Cameron,
uh,

307
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:15.750
that had graduated with my cousin from UFC had started a lab in Santa Barbara

308
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:20.370
and he bought this piece of equipment that could analyze,
uh,

309
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:25.590
any sort of biological fluid,
tissue,
blood,
urine,
uh,

310
00:18:25.591 --> 00:18:28.890
but they mainly use these pieces of equipment.

311
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.300
His actual contract that he had at the time was with Hughes aircraft and they

312
00:18:33.301 --> 00:18:37.350
would drain the oil from the engines on a jet and analyze,

313
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.670
um,

314
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:43.410
the oil for the concentration of metals so they would know when to replace the

315
00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:47.930
engine parts.
And,
but he also knew that there was an application of this,
uh,

316
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.810
in terms of,
uh,
medical and specifically sport application.

317
00:18:51.811 --> 00:18:54.250
And he knew that I was a track athlete and in,
um,

318
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.630
in high school and college and he said,
I've got an idea.
And he,

319
00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:58.920
he pitched this to me.

320
00:18:58.921 --> 00:19:01.740
I went down to Santa Barbara where the equipment was at that time.

321
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:05.970
And long story short,
I couldn't even pronounce the name of the instrument.

322
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:11.010
I said,
sure,
it sounds like a good idea to me.
Um,
I could buy it for $25.
I mean,

323
00:19:11.011 --> 00:19:15.420
excuse me,
$10 and analysis and sell it for $25 and analysis.

324
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.530
So I was in business.
He flew up to the bay area and,

325
00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.950
and hooked me up with a few medical doctors and they started using the service.

326
00:19:22.951 --> 00:19:27.930
And you had no background.
I had no background whatsoever whatsoever.
And uh,

327
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.640
but you know,
I always had people have called it Victor's knack and,

328
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.450
and so I founded back on March of 1984.
Well,

329
00:19:36.451 --> 00:19:39.530
immediately I started,
you know,

330
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.460
hooking up with world class athletes.

331
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:44.610
The first one was Alberto Salazar who was the world record holder in the

332
00:19:44.611 --> 00:19:48.000
marathon at the time.
They'd won the New York City Marathon two or three times.

333
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.390
And shortly after,
it was Matt Biondi,

334
00:19:50.391 --> 00:19:53.490
who at that time was the world's fastest swimmer who wants seven or eight gold

335
00:19:53.491 --> 00:19:57.810
medals in the Olympics in 1988 and it just continue.
The next thing you know,

336
00:19:57.811 --> 00:20:01.380
I had the professional football players and,
and uh,

337
00:20:01.381 --> 00:20:05.150
so I started building this database and I just kind of learned as I went along.

338
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.920
And,
and,
uh,
eventually I did learn how to,

339
00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.480
to run an operate the equipment and we became fully,
um,

340
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.090
medicare certified and licensed and,
and,
uh,
so,

341
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.480
so what exactly were you doing for these athletes from nicely while we were

342
00:20:18.481 --> 00:20:22.320
analyzing a ma,
we called it multiple compartment,

343
00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:27.120
multi element analysis.
So we would look at,
at up to 40 different elements,

344
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.100
predominantly minerals and trace elements,

345
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.290
and we'd centrifuge the blood separated into the fluid portion,

346
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.810
the plasma or serum and the pack cells or red blood cells.

347
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:41.370
We looked at whole blood,
we looked at urine.
So we calculate their retention,

348
00:20:41.371 --> 00:20:43.820
excretion and,
and all these ratios.

349
00:20:43.821 --> 00:20:48.130
And then I would develop individualized nutrition programs for the athletes in a

350
00:20:48.131 --> 00:20:52.540
short period of time.
Um,
I had,

351
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.050
they'll Roman our ski,
uh,
showed up at Palcos door.

352
00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:01.200
It was when he left the 40 niners in 95 and then he went to Philadelphia for a

353
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:03.670
year and had a great season.
Even one game.

354
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:06.280
He had 24 tackles in a game following year.

355
00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:09.190
He became the leader of the Denver Broncos.

356
00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.330
I talked with our Arthur's a porn who was the team physician of the Broncos.

357
00:21:13.331 --> 00:21:17.470
He probably still is today,
but he,
but he was then went to training camp,

358
00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:19.810
a tested every one of the players,

359
00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:24.190
a blood and urine samples and created an individual nutrition program for all 85

360
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:26.770
guys and training camp.
Long story short,

361
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.050
they not only won the Superbowl that year,

362
00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:33.220
but they won the Superbowl the following year.
It just kind of right time,

363
00:21:33.221 --> 00:21:35.170
right place,
right ideas.
Uh,

364
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.250
so this kind of created a lot of attention regarding what I was doing.

365
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.840
And previous to that though,
I had,
um,

366
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:46.950
went to the Olympics in 1988 and I'd worked with a 25 athletes,

367
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.210
judo athletes,
track athletes,
uh,
and Matt Biondi the swimmer.

368
00:21:52.211 --> 00:21:56.230
Long story short of those 25 athletes that I helped,

369
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.590
they brought back a total of 15 metals with a whole United States team,

370
00:21:59.591 --> 00:22:03.550
brought back 97 so 20% of the metals that came back were people that I had been

371
00:22:03.551 --> 00:22:07.320
helping.
Well,
so I says,
oh,

372
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.880
this was all the gent has this.

373
00:22:09.881 --> 00:22:14.780
This was from 84 through 2000 this is just a mineral vitamins.

374
00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.180
It was all legit.
Now did I know that some of these guys,

375
00:22:19.181 --> 00:22:23.620
as an example,
in 88 I worked with all the shot putters,
hammer throwers,

376
00:22:23.621 --> 00:22:28.340
discus throwers.
Well of course you,
the guys were all doing stuff.
You know,

377
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:33.460
I knew that they were doing stuff,
but I wasn't involved directly in that.

378
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.120
So you were just brought in as the the analyst.

379
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.250
The nutritionist is what I did.
I provided nutritional supplements based on,

380
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.080
on the comprehensive blood and urine test.
How were those guys?

381
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.890
How did they pass tests?
Do they have it timed?
Is that what they were doing?

382
00:22:47.891 --> 00:22:52.891
Of course they would just take her off and pass and here's where the big turn

383
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.280
occurred after the 88 Olympics.

384
00:22:57.281 --> 00:23:02.281
And I dunno if you've recently watched this 9.79 asterik program that has been

385
00:23:02.291 --> 00:23:06.280
on ESPN,
the 30,
30 about Ben Johnson.
No,
I haven't seen that.
It's a,

386
00:23:06.281 --> 00:23:10.720
it's a very interesting documentary and I was there in [inaudible] 88 standing

387
00:23:10.721 --> 00:23:13.030
at the finish line when he ran nine 79.

388
00:23:13.031 --> 00:23:16.960
And all of this came down and long story short,
all these eight guys,

389
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.440
one at a time,
you know,

390
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:22.330
since then have either been busted or admitted that they were using performance

391
00:23:22.331 --> 00:23:24.100
enhancing drugs.
Of course he was not,

392
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:29.590
he was not the only one but very interesting program.
And,
and uh,

393
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:34.290
thereafter,
um,
four years later in 1992,
uh,

394
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.520
at the track and field trials in New Orleans,

395
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:41.560
I had befriended this Olympic official and I was working,
uh,

396
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.230
with one of the same shot putters Greg for,
uh,

397
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.990
who in 1992 at the farthest thrown in the world at 72,
one and a half.

398
00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.760
And at these trials he tested positive.

399
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.600
So this guy,
which we won't name,

400
00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.020
but he lives here in southern California,
he was an Olympic official.

401
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.470
He's no longer involved with track and field,
but,
but at that time he was,

402
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:08.510
and he said,
call me and said,
your boy tested positive.
He said,
you're kidding.

403
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.400
So I,
I called Greg,
told him,
he told his wife,
Mary,

404
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.680
you know,
this was what he was going to do.

405
00:24:15.681 --> 00:24:17.690
Now he's going to have to look for a job.
I mean,
he was,

406
00:24:17.691 --> 00:24:21.860
this was quite upsetting to him.
And then three or four days later,

407
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:25.340
I get a call back from the same guy.
And he said,
well,

408
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:29.960
one of the oldest states when at TAC,
it used to be called the athletic congress.

409
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:33.860
Now it's USACF,
TF,
United States track and field.
And he said,
uh,

410
00:24:33.861 --> 00:24:37.570
one of the elder states when passed away,
and,
uh,

411
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:41.600
they had a reception afterwards and some of these big dogs within the

412
00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:46.100
organization got together and decided that it was time to sweep these five

413
00:24:46.101 --> 00:24:49.820
positive drug tests that,
uh,
that they came up with under the rug.

414
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.520
So tell your boys off the hook.
Wow.

415
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.720
So once I had firsthand knowledge of this,
that you know,

416
00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.290
and I also knew that there were other positive drug tests that were covered up

417
00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:05.210
and in 1988 and soul.
So this weighed on me for a while.
Uh,

418
00:25:05.211 --> 00:25:09.670
and it wasn't until 2000 when when I was at,
uh,

419
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.620
Mister Olympia bodybuilding contest in Las Vegas.

420
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:17.270
And the guy that made the original stock of the clear that was involved in Balco

421
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.270
Patrick Arnold,
he's going,
hey,
I've got some stuff.

422
00:25:20.271 --> 00:25:22.220
He called his stuff and he said,
I,
you know,

423
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.910
I don't think it will cause a positive test.
It,
it,
he wouldn't know for sure.

424
00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:30.200
He said,
well,
may,
you know,
it seems to enhance recovery,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

425
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:34.940
So I bought some of this stuff from him for about $150,
I think.

426
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:39.290
Did you ask him like how it works?
You know,
I still didn't,

427
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.380
now I can tell you exactly what it was.
It was something called nor bowl-a-thon,

428
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.520
which is an anabolic steroid that was developed in the 1960s.
Uh,

429
00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:51.380
there were liver toxicity issues about it and they never brought it to market.

430
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.120
So he saw this in the Merck index and you know,
made this stuff.

431
00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.380
And so the bottom line is that,
uh,
I gave,

432
00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:04.520
I took some myself for four consecutive days in a row and I was trying to,

433
00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:07.220
it was a suppression test.
I was trying to determine,
you know,

434
00:26:07.221 --> 00:26:09.590
does it have an affinity for the androgen receptor?

435
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:14.360
And each and every day my own endogenous production of testosterone went down to

436
00:26:14.361 --> 00:26:15.110
zero.

437
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:20.110
After four days I realized that it does have an affinity for the receptor is

438
00:26:20.571 --> 00:26:23.150
anabolic.
It's very potent.

439
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.470
So the first thing I did was diluted by 50% and change the frequency in dosage

440
00:26:27.471 --> 00:26:32.340
schedule compared to what he was using.
But,
uh,
shortly thereafter,
you know,
with,

441
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.790
with this reduced dosage,
I started giving it to,

442
00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:39.980
to various athletes and I also had it tested and it came back clean.

443
00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:43.770
So it was undetectable.

444
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.090
So it was undetectable because people just didn't know what it was.
No,

445
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.520
because they,
what they have is a,
first of all,

446
00:26:51.521 --> 00:26:54.630
all the rules changed when,
when Balco and the balco case,

447
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.010
we're talking pre balco.
Okay.

448
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:02.850
They have a list of about a 30 to 35 anabolic steroids.

449
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.110
And for each one of those,

450
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:07.860
they have what's called a mass spectrogram fragmentation pattern.
It's like a,

451
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:08.880
it's like a thumbprint,

452
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:13.470
so they can measure all these peaks and it either matches or doesn't.

453
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:18.420
So they're looking for specific things,
specific,

454
00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:23.310
a pattern of a specific anabolic steroid.
So if you've got one that's not,

455
00:27:23.311 --> 00:27:27.120
doesn't have the fingerprint,
there is no match,
well then they can't see it,

456
00:27:27.121 --> 00:27:31.650
so to speak.
Wow.
So however,
that's all changed now.

457
00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:35.040
Now they,
they,
uh,
if you want me to explain that,
I can explain to you why,

458
00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.060
what's the difference?
They changed all the laws.
Bucko changed everything.
Um,

459
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:43.860
he used to be two tiers of the first is that,
um,
uh,

460
00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:47.940
for an anabolic steroid is that it's similar in structure to testosterone,

461
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:53.570
all anabolic steroids or modified or,
or derivatives of testosterone.
Okay.

462
00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:58.970
The second prong was that there had to be some sort of scientific evidence

463
00:27:59.581 --> 00:28:03.640
proving that it created the protein synthesis,
that it,

464
00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:07.530
that it promoted muscle growth.
Well,
in this case there was,

465
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:11.220
there was science to promoted this.
They just couldn't see it.

466
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:16.290
Now they've removed that second prong.
So even if they don't at the time,

467
00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:20.190
you know,
I'm the one that made up the name the clear later they said,
well,

468
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:25.140
you know,
have you this t h g,
you know,
did you,
what about thcs?
So what's that?

469
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.380
A Tetra Hydro gesture known,
never heard of it.

470
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.510
I didn't know what they were even talking about.

471
00:28:30.511 --> 00:28:33.330
And this is what the chemists through reverse engineering we're able to do to

472
00:28:33.331 --> 00:28:35.580
figure out,
you know,
what that was,

473
00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.550
but understand that was two versions of the clear.

474
00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:40.410
The first was the snore Bola phone.

475
00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:45.980
And then I had access to all kinds of inside information within the Olympic

476
00:28:47.971 --> 00:28:49.260
testing network.

477
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:54.620
And what I mean by that is let's talk about where they do the testing now for

478
00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:57.660
Usada,
for Vata,

479
00:28:57.661 --> 00:29:02.420
for everybody at the Ucla Olympic Analytical Laboratory near Los Angeles,
uh,

480
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.400
Ucla by the campus.
Um,
there was a guy that,

481
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:07.740
that actually,

482
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:13.790
he was the assistant to Don Catlin was there for 15 years and he left.

483
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.050
And I knew somebody that knew him.
And long story short,
I ended up hiring him.

484
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:23.610
So I had,
you know,
obviously he knew people in the lab.
Uh,

485
00:29:23.611 --> 00:29:28.611
he actually told me that this original species of the clear on nor bola phone

486
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:34.410
that he personally had went to rifle laboratories in 1982 when they built the

487
00:29:34.411 --> 00:29:35.910
lab.
Uh,

488
00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:39.630
and the purpose was for the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

489
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.040
And he went to Don Catlin and said,

490
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:47.940
you need to create a test for this substance.

491
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:52.930
It's in this merch index.
Guys could get this,
they could make this,

492
00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:54.910
it could be everywhere and you wouldn't know it.

493
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:58.750
So he brought it to his attention in his own words.
He said,
well they,
you know,

494
00:29:58.751 --> 00:30:03.390
Don Catlin kind of told me to blow it out my ass and he,

495
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.530
they just ignored him.
Well,

496
00:30:05.531 --> 00:30:09.010
exactly what he predicted happened.

497
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:13.360
And that's in about 1997 Patrick saw this,

498
00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:18.520
he made this,
it got out there,
he gave some to me.

499
00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:21.370
So I gave it to all these Olympic athletes.

500
00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:26.260
But an interesting aspect of this story,
and this has been out there before,

501
00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:29.860
but I,
I don't know that many within the world of MMA know this,

502
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.510
but Patrick made like a gallon of this stuff.

503
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:39.160
We only needed a couple of drops.
How did you do?
What did it work?

504
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.310
I mean it was a very powerful anabolic steroid,

505
00:30:42.311 --> 00:30:46.000
but it's sublingual Trump an eyedropper and you'd put a couple of drops under

506
00:30:46.001 --> 00:30:50.890
your tongue.
Now here's what I was told.
I don't want to create more,

507
00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.110
you know,
multimillion dollar lawsuits against me.

508
00:30:53.111 --> 00:30:57.640
But here's the story that I was told.
He sold a whole bunch of this stuff,

509
00:30:57.641 --> 00:31:01.210
like a gallon to Bob Sapp,
one fighter.

510
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:08.150
And my understanding is this stuff was all over the NFL.
It was,
I,

511
00:31:08.151 --> 00:31:11.260
I guess that during this time you'd bid was out of the NFL and I think there was

512
00:31:11.261 --> 00:31:14.920
a period of time when he played in the Canadian league before he went to Japan,

513
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.900
uh,
to do the k one fighting.

514
00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:21.100
But the point is this stuff was very widely distributed,

515
00:31:21.101 --> 00:31:22.180
is my understanding.

516
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:26.040
<v 1>Bob Sapp got to a level that was like,
well,</v>

517
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:31.080
I couldn't even say cartoonish because it was more like a CGI who was like,

518
00:31:31.121 --> 00:31:31.954
he was like,

519
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.680
he was the first guy ever that could have played the incredible hulk.

520
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:39.340
Like he really could have played the hulk because he was that big.

521
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:43.390
I mean like Lou Ferrigno and when he played the hulk,
he's like a bodybuilder.

522
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.840
I mean,
he was very well built,
who's was obviously very muscular,

523
00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.430
but he wasn't ridiculous.

524
00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:53.530
There's something about Bob Sapp when he was 370 pounds with a six pack.

525
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.460
That was just,
it was just ridiculous.

526
00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:00.460
He probably didn't know there was a connection between balco and Bob Sapp.
No,

527
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.500
no,
no,
no.
He bought a and that stuff.

528
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.130
Just think about how much of I said No.
All you had to do,

529
00:32:09.131 --> 00:32:10.630
I mean that pull up a picture of him,

530
00:32:10.631 --> 00:32:14.920
Brian pull up a picture of SAP versus Nogueira look in Google images,

531
00:32:14.921 --> 00:32:18.520
Bob Sapp versus no gear.
The photos are so ridiculous,

532
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.350
you can't even believe he's a real human.

533
00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.650
<v 2>So anyway,
I,
because I had a lot of uh,
I suppose to care,</v>

534
00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.120
I had a lot of contacts,
you know,

535
00:32:27.121 --> 00:32:32.121
within within the Olympic testing facilities and so on that the,

536
00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:40.730
they found some quote peculiar metabolites in the urine of Marion Jones and

537
00:32:41.511 --> 00:32:44.840
other athletes.
So they started asking athletes,

538
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:49.310
the actual testers that go out to these athletes,
um,
you know,

539
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:52.010
training facilities and without naming names,

540
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:54.650
but a guy that was on the team in 2000 that the,

541
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.030
I think he got fourth in the discus from,
from the u s he didn't get a medal,

542
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.490
but there you go.

543
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:03.100
<v 3>The size of him,</v>

544
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:08.670
the video of in the beginning pulled to do the very beginning of the match

545
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.500
because when he's about to what they're both about the fight,
like even before,

546
00:33:13.501 --> 00:33:16.470
like when they're in their stand in the center of the ring and the referee says,

547
00:33:16.471 --> 00:33:20.130
go,
you see him?
Oh this is the second round.
He's already tired.

548
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:24.840
Look at the fucking size of him.
Oh my God,
that guy was big.

549
00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:27.460
<v 2>I'm sorry.
So continue.
So</v>

550
00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.390
I get a call from,

551
00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.470
from a guy that I'm working with a shot putter who's friends with this.

552
00:33:34.471 --> 00:33:37.440
It was on the Olympic team with its discus thrower and he said,
hey,

553
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.820
they're asking questions.
What do we know about this balco laboratories?
You know,

554
00:33:41.821 --> 00:33:45.840
is there any connection?
And here's what we're trying to figure out.

555
00:33:45.841 --> 00:33:46.770
What is this stuff?

556
00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:51.240
And so the bottom line is we just switched over and had,

557
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.240
so there was another undetectable that was ready to go.

558
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.690
So we just carried that one and brought the second generation out.

559
00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:02.080
<v 3>Damn.
He didn't even slow down,
didn't even slow down.
And you just think you were,</v>

560
00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:03.070
did you think that the whole,

561
00:34:03.071 --> 00:34:06.550
because of you knowing that the Olympic Committee had fudge some tests,

562
00:34:06.551 --> 00:34:08.860
did you just think the whole thing was bullshit and then you're going to get

563
00:34:08.861 --> 00:34:09.694
through it?

564
00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:13.980
<v 2>I did.
I subconsciously,
I had this,
um,</v>

565
00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:16.240
<v 4>yeah.</v>

566
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.520
<v 2>I mean,
my plan didn't work out.</v>

567
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:23.790
It was because I knew this guy that told me all this on the inside was a very

568
00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:27.940
credible,
uh,
you know,
guys,

569
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:30.970
a Japanese follow that really had a high level of integrity.

570
00:34:30.971 --> 00:34:34.750
He left the whole Olympic track and field movement.
He,

571
00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:38.950
he worked there after with many famous,
uh,
tennis players,

572
00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:42.010
Wimbledon champions and a whole list of,

573
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:47.020
I worked with a lot of different Mike Michael Chang,
uh,
Yvonne Lendl,

574
00:34:47.021 --> 00:34:51.550
a Greg Reduced Ski Sharapova,
uh,
many,

575
00:34:51.551 --> 00:34:56.470
many great.
Uh,
he was a trainer and uh,
I,

576
00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:00.370
my thought was if they come after me,
my,

577
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.220
my get out of jail ticket,
so to speak would be,

578
00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.490
we'll just subpoena this guy and he can tell what he knows about what

579
00:35:06.491 --> 00:35:11.050
everybody's doing.
And then I realized that,
that,
you know,

580
00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.100
if there was a,
if he was subpoenaed and he was under oath,

581
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.210
that would be one thing.

582
00:35:16.211 --> 00:35:19.030
If there was a congressional committee hearing that would be another,

583
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.230
but I'm not just going to send reporters to his house and destroy this guy's

584
00:35:23.231 --> 00:35:28.020
life.
And,
uh,
it became better in the case,
uh,

585
00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.020
of Balco for me to,
um,

586
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:35.360
do this global plea bargain.

587
00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:40.780
And the way that all came down was because I knew that they had lied on in many

588
00:35:41.071 --> 00:35:44.970
of the memorandums and it was all sorts of bad stuff that the government had

589
00:35:44.971 --> 00:35:49.770
done.
And I learned about this and used it in terms of leverage.

590
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.510
And literally the way the Balco case ended is I dictated all the terms and

591
00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:57.990
conditions of,
of what I would get and,
and,
um,

592
00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:00.870
was able to do so for the other guys like Barry Bonds,
his trainer,

593
00:36:00.871 --> 00:36:04.590
Greg Anderson and Jim Valenti and Remy court chimney.

594
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:08.940
And honest to God,
I had seen Martha Stewart,
uh,

595
00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.520
she kind of went in over a holiday period,

596
00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:13.650
was in there five months and I thought,
you know what,

597
00:36:13.651 --> 00:36:17.550
to be away from my business and do what I needed to do.
If I can plan this right,

598
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:22.820
I'll just accept foreign for four months in a minimum security prison and four

599
00:36:23.371 --> 00:36:26.940
months of ankle bracelet and a,
that way I can continue.

600
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.760
The VP of Balco got straight probation,

601
00:36:29.761 --> 00:36:31.800
so he was able to continue to run my business.

602
00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:36.980
I was able to continue to have my income at the same level and this protected

603
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.080
everybody from having to come forward and testify in a trial.

604
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:48.710
So I what led you to start giving them illegal substances or substances?

605
00:36:49.381 --> 00:36:50.760
Either you knew what cheating.
Well,

606
00:36:50.761 --> 00:36:53.130
you have to understand in the beginning it started with the clear,

607
00:36:53.131 --> 00:36:56.700
I didn't consider it to be an illegal substance because when the guy said he had

608
00:36:56.701 --> 00:36:58.850
this stuff,
you didn't think it was illegal.
Well,

609
00:36:58.851 --> 00:37:02.850
I didn't really know what it was.
I,
this guy also introduced a,

610
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.910
a pro hormones.
If you remember when Mark Mcgwire,

611
00:37:05.911 --> 00:37:08.400
they found the sports illustrated writer,

612
00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:12.870
Steven Wilson had found it in his locker and everything broke about Andrew

613
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:15.810
Stanton island.
This is the guy that introduced and to the United States market.

614
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.360
So I wasn't sure what it was.

615
00:37:18.361 --> 00:37:23.361
I mean literally there were three different species and later I saw when they

616
00:37:25.411 --> 00:37:27.360
tried to smuggle this through customs in Canada.

617
00:37:27.361 --> 00:37:32.361
But what I'd seen all the bottles and the first one said nor stuff the second

618
00:37:32.911 --> 00:37:37.590
one sentence,
give it the trend stuff and the third one says new stuff.

619
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:42.000
And so you've just given us the people,
you know,
did I give the kit?

620
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:46.680
Then I did testing and then you got to understand that all these athletes that

621
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:50.550
work with me routinely,
they were on a very short leash,

622
00:37:50.551 --> 00:37:53.730
meaning they got a three week on,
one week off cycle,

623
00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.880
and if they didn't come back and have their blood tested so we could monitor

624
00:37:56.881 --> 00:38:00.150
liver function,
kidney function,
cluster,
all fractions and all the rest,

625
00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.220
that that was the end of the supply.

626
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:07.490
So in my mind I was helping them do what in almost every case they were already

627
00:38:08.581 --> 00:38:12.450
doing themselves only they were buying it out of trunks of cars in dark alleys

628
00:38:12.451 --> 00:38:13.530
behind gyms.

629
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.790
I owned a fully licensed clinical laboratory where we could do all these testing

630
00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:18.581
and,

631
00:38:18.581 --> 00:38:22.440
and then they would have the opportunity to make more informed decisions and in

632
00:38:22.441 --> 00:38:25.860
most cases they use much lower dosages,
which were equally,

633
00:38:25.861 --> 00:38:29.730
if not more effective at a certain point in time when you were initially working

634
00:38:29.731 --> 00:38:32.940
with people and just giving them nutrition and then realizing that some of them

635
00:38:32.941 --> 00:38:36.610
were doing steroids.
Did you just that it's an inevitability,

636
00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:39.520
<v 3>it's just a part of a sports period.
High Level Sports.</v>

637
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.280
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

638
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.850
<v 3>Like I say,
once I gathered this information that everybody's in on it,</v>

639
00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:50.100
meaning the Olympic officials are actually covering up positive drug tests at an

640
00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.280
Olympic Games.
Um,

641
00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.130
I had been on the sideline from 92 and for eight years and,

642
00:38:55.140 --> 00:39:00.140
and just at a certain point I made that decision to go down that slippery slope

643
00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:05.310
and I was at the right decision.
Obviously not in many respects.

644
00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:09.270
You say you didn't know what it was and you didn't think it was illegal,

645
00:39:09.271 --> 00:39:12.180
but as soon as they were looking for you changed it.
Wow.

646
00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:16.740
You knew that there was something that was probably unkosher about it.
Well,

647
00:39:16.741 --> 00:39:20.390
and then once I had,
this was a rationalization in my mind,
right?

648
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.930
Helping people do things that you know more safely.
I mean,
but it's,

649
00:39:24.931 --> 00:39:27.510
part of it was wrong.
I was all wrong.
So let,
let me,

650
00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:32.190
let me say that because thereafter,
once you cross that line,

651
00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:37.470
then we started using all sorts of other things,
EPO,

652
00:39:37.471 --> 00:39:40.680
growth,
hormone,
thyroid,
you know,
uh,

653
00:39:40.681 --> 00:39:44.040
all sorts of stimulants that were undetectable.
Uh,
you know,

654
00:39:44.041 --> 00:39:47.160
there was seven or eight or nine different drugs that,
that,
uh,

655
00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:52.230
these athletes were using.
Oh,
I see.
So it was sort of a,
once it started,

656
00:39:52.231 --> 00:39:54.900
the snowball started rolling and then you just started collecting,

657
00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.710
collecting drug that you're doing.
You know,
it's the,

658
00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:03.000
everything that works in the beginning when I tell you that I hired Charlie

659
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.680
Francis and he came down for this project.

660
00:40:04.681 --> 00:40:07.050
And if you've ever listened to any of the things that you've said,

661
00:40:07.051 --> 00:40:11.850
I'm not saying it's right,
but it's the use or lose mentality,
right?

662
00:40:11.851 --> 00:40:13.440
You know,
the other guys doing it,

663
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.680
you feel you got to do what you gotta do in order to be competitive.

664
00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:18.120
And you know,

665
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:21.930
I don't know that I agree with this now and I've said this myself before that,

666
00:40:21.931 --> 00:40:22.051
you know,

667
00:40:22.051 --> 00:40:25.400
it's not cheating if everyone's doing it where it probably is because everyone,

668
00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.800
it's a level playing field.
It's just not the one everyone thought it was.
Right.

669
00:40:28.801 --> 00:40:31.110
And is that what's going on right now in professional sports?

670
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.080
You know,
it's,
um,

671
00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:39.610
is it possible to have athletes that you see today in professional sports

672
00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:43.690
without performance enhancing drugs?
Isn't it,
is it possible just through,

673
00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.200
you know,

674
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.370
the natural selection of big athletic people dating big athletic people and

675
00:40:48.371 --> 00:40:50.590
making big athletic kids question.

676
00:40:50.591 --> 00:40:54.970
There are athletes that have broke world records and won Olympic gold medals on

677
00:40:54.971 --> 00:40:59.470
the nat naturally.
Absolutely.
That can happen,
but those are freaks.

678
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.500
They're genetic freaks and there's not diminish them.

679
00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:04.240
There's not that many of them.

680
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:07.150
And then there's guys like Armstrong's that might be a freak

681
00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:12.040
and it looks like it was doing something like,
then they say Armstrong,

682
00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.800
Lance Armstrong has an abnormally large heart and they're like,

683
00:41:14.801 --> 00:41:18.560
he processes blood better than the average person does just naturally and

684
00:41:18.561 --> 00:41:19.394
genetically.

685
00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:20.400
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

686
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.310
<v 3>Yeah.
But it's like you saying bolt and he's got all these gifts.
But you know,</v>

687
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:29.040
my,
I'm highly suspicious that not only he's on drugs,

688
00:41:29.041 --> 00:41:33.950
but most of the track athletes that are on the Jamaican island or on drugs.

689
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.200
<v 2>What are they on?
If you had to guess,</v>

690
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:41.300
if I had to guess seven or eight different drugs.
Um,
my sense is that,
um,

691
00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.200
well let me back up and put this in perspective.

692
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:50.600
If you heard the name memo Heredia no memo.
A memo is this nickname.

693
00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:55.280
It's actually Angel Heredia in the Balco case.
This is the guy,

694
00:41:55.281 --> 00:41:59.510
there were two people that were at the very top of the food chain.

695
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:03.800
Angel was one of them.
He was a discus thrower from,
uh,

696
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:06.320
from Texas a and,
m.

697
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:11.650
And he was the supplier for Trevor Graham and Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery in

698
00:42:12.021 --> 00:42:16.220
the sprint capitol group that was in Raleigh,
North Carolina,
that,
uh,

699
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:19.310
won a whole bunch of Olympic gold medals and so on.

700
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:23.570
They ended up indicting Trevor Marion's coach,
uh,

701
00:42:23.571 --> 00:42:25.100
for lying to a federal agent.

702
00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:29.940
This guy came and testified against,
uh,

703
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:34.790
Trevor and he got leniency in exchange for that.

704
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:38.540
So he never got any consequences whatsoever.
He was the guy making all the money,

705
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:41.930
was at the top of the food chain.
He was the main dealer.
Well,

706
00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:46.310
he's now works with one mil.
Manwell Marquez.
Who's fighting Manny Pacquiao next.

707
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.480
Yeah,
I saw that.
I saw that people were very suspicious.
He changed his name.

708
00:42:50.481 --> 00:42:54.470
If you remember,
all of a sudden,
I'm the one that saw him on Hbo,
24,
seven.
I said,

709
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.720
oh my God,
that's memo.
And,
and he,

710
00:42:56.721 --> 00:43:00.020
his real name is Heredia and all of a sudden it was Angel Hernandez.

711
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.680
So he changed his name and thought nobody would recognize him.
And of course,

712
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:05.480
and so the,
the word is,

713
00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:10.430
and the stream under the bus is that he's working with the Jamaican athletes.

714
00:43:10.431 --> 00:43:13.670
He,
he's uh,
he's said as much in,

715
00:43:13.671 --> 00:43:15.650
in UK interviews.

716
00:43:15.651 --> 00:43:20.651
And I know somebody who saw him after Usain bolt ran a nine 69 and did

717
00:43:20.901 --> 00:43:24.320
everything they did in,
in Beijing at the Olympics,

718
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:27.230
at the world championships the following year.
So

719
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:32.300
<v 1>point is,
is it possible that this guy is just doing it legally now?</v>

720
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.330
And that's why no one another,

721
00:43:33.331 --> 00:43:37.430
because people are testing positive one memoir Marquez.
No.
Impossible.
No,

722
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.820
because they don't have any testing.
What testing is Juan Manwell mark has doing?

723
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:44.300
Well,
I don't know.
I mean it's,
it didn't he get tested in Vegas?

724
00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:48.790
<v 2>Well,
that's about tapering off and just,
you know,</v>

725
00:43:48.791 --> 00:43:51.640
you have to be dumb.
That's Iq testing.
That's not drug testing.

726
00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:55.940
<v 1>I see.
So,
um,
these but these Olympic athletes</v>

727
00:43:56.190 --> 00:44:00.650
<v 2>tested,
correct?
Well,
even that's relatively easy to circumvent.
How's that?</v>

728
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:04.490
Well,
let's just,
okay.
You want me to explain exactly how you can,

729
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:07.970
<v 1>sure.
Let's pretend I'm Hussein both data.
I'm fucking awesome.</v>

730
00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:11.110
Just when the Olympics,
what are you going to do now?
Here's the fun,

731
00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.570
<v 2>here's the way it works.
And this is the big loophole.</v>

732
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:19.230
You get to miss tests in any given 18 month period as an Olympic athlete.

733
00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.770
So it was just like getting a speeding ticket on your driving record.

734
00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:28.870
So here you are low,
you have a whereabouts form,
you fill it out and you say,

735
00:44:28.871 --> 00:44:31.770
I'm going to be at training center x and you don't go there.

736
00:44:31.771 --> 00:44:34.260
You go to training center.
Why?
Well,

737
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:37.680
the odds are I've calculated about 25 to one that they're not going to go to

738
00:44:37.681 --> 00:44:39.540
that training center.
But even if they do,

739
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:44.220
the worst scenario is it's like being up to bat and American baseball game

740
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:47.820
strike one.
Does that mean you're out?
They don't disclose that.

741
00:44:47.821 --> 00:44:48.960
Nobody gets told that.

742
00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:53.961
So if you go and you win the Olympics and you test positive for steroids,

743
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:58.080
it's just a strike.
They just burn.
I don't use positive,

744
00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.960
I'm s I'm talking about a missed test.

745
00:45:00.961 --> 00:45:05.010
Miss test this task like you were supposed to take it but you didn't show up.

746
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:08.460
You didn't show up.
Okay,
so that's strike one.
Okay,
that's true.

747
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:12.360
That's the downside.
Okay.
First of all,
there's no transparency,
so nobody knows.

748
00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:16.040
So you missed the test.
We still have to test that strike one.
Well,
no,
no,

749
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:19.440
they don't come right back the next day.
What they do is the,

750
00:45:19.441 --> 00:45:22.350
they say they sent you a letter and say,
Hey,
you missed this test.

751
00:45:22.351 --> 00:45:23.460
Show up at this hearing and,

752
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:27.300
and you can give us a reasonable explanation or present exceptional

753
00:45:27.301 --> 00:45:30.750
circumstances are,
you can argue this or you get the strike.

754
00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:35.890
This is for the Olympics.
You feel at this.
Okay,
then,
okay,
so you're,

755
00:45:35.891 --> 00:45:39.240
you're six months out from the Olympics.
You do this two or three times.

756
00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.870
Maybe they come one time to get one strike.
Then they,

757
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:45.660
you do it again and they come and they're really targeting you now.

758
00:45:45.661 --> 00:45:49.950
So they come back a second time and you're not there and it's striked too,

759
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:53.310
right?
You go to the Olympics,
you win the gold medal,

760
00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:57.000
you cash in and you get all the endorsement money.
Well,
the time is rolling.

761
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:59.550
How much,
how many days could it possibly be?
Well,

762
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:01.800
the whole period of time you're not,

763
00:46:01.801 --> 00:46:06.450
you can't have three tests in any given 18 month period.
You can have to,

764
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:10.440
otherwise they suspend your license.
Or once you've got to Ms Tests,

765
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:15.120
you cannot take any more chances in terms of using drugs until the oldest miss

766
00:46:15.121 --> 00:46:18.450
test falls off your record.
Just like a ticket on your driving record.

767
00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:23.600
Makes Sense.
So when you know that you're positive,
you just miss your tests,

768
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:27.720
you just,
yeah.
You make yourself unavailable.
Jesus crafts.

769
00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:32.010
What happened with Marian?
No.
What's her name?
Uh,
the tennis player.

770
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.550
What are the girls names?
The big ones.
The will,

771
00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:37.170
the way the Williams and the other one.
One of them,

772
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.870
they came to her house for a random drug test.

773
00:46:39.871 --> 00:46:43.410
So she went in her panic room and called the police.
What?

774
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:47.230
She thought she didn't give a sample.
Awesome.
So let's,
Oh fuck.

775
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:51.510
So here's the bottom line.
What happened?
Is there any consequence?
I don't know.

776
00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:54.630
She got a miss test it.
Nobody ever knew about it.
But basically that's,

777
00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.240
that is a tennis thing.
I've never heard of that before.

778
00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:58.440
Have you ever heard about this?

779
00:46:58.441 --> 00:47:01.070
That's why they have what they call a whereabouts form.

780
00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:04.860
You have to fill these forms out.
You can communicate by email,
text message,

781
00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:07.620
let them know where you are and if they decide to show up,

782
00:47:07.621 --> 00:47:11.820
but let's put it in perspective.
They on average,

783
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:17.240
they test about twice a year out of competition,

784
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.760
meaning they show up and you know unexpected.

785
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:25.170
Now let's not count the Times that they test you at a competition.

786
00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:30.280
You know,
let's talk about baseball for a minute.
They test these players

787
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:34.000
<v 5>twice a year.
The first test is at training camp.
That's announced testing.</v>

788
00:47:34.001 --> 00:47:36.580
That's Iq testing.
How dumb do you have to be to be caught?

789
00:47:36.581 --> 00:47:40.480
Then you just know that the taper times a certain amount,
you go off,
he show up,

790
00:47:40.481 --> 00:47:41.890
you get your test.
Well,

791
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:45.400
if they're not targeting you and they have no reason to target at target,

792
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:49.060
you then here's what the guys say,
okay,

793
00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:53.610
it's April 1st.
By the first week of May I get my second test,
green light.

794
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:56.320
She is all the stuff we like is,
we already had a second test.

795
00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:02.220
<v 3>So you for one month you played baseball until you have your mandatory second</v>

796
00:48:02.221 --> 00:48:05.580
test.
It could be a month and you just choose to the walls.

797
00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:09.130
Let's look at the statistics here.
Here,
here,
most of them

798
00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:14.210
<v 5>gains for four Olympic athletes and for Ma NFL and major league baseball and</v>

799
00:48:16.891 --> 00:48:21.090
professional sports during the off season,

800
00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:25.830
they load up on all kinds of performance enhancing drugs,

801
00:48:25.831 --> 00:48:30.831
including anabolic steroids and do intensive weight training for four or five

802
00:48:31.831 --> 00:48:36.270
months.
And the gains they make,
what kind of gains can you make?

803
00:48:36.271 --> 00:48:40.220
Tiny Tim,
Tim Montgomery that,
that broke the world record.
Uh,
the,

804
00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:43.860
with the project world record that I talked about earlier,
he,

805
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:48.950
in eight weeks he came anyway at one 48 he put on 28 pounds of muscle in eight

806
00:48:50.401 --> 00:48:50.731
weeks.

807
00:48:50.731 --> 00:48:55.731
It's bench press went from two 40 to 65 to three 45 and eight weeks.

808
00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:00.450
So a lot can be done in four or five months using powerful drugs.

809
00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:02.880
Those gains carry over.

810
00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:07.770
So when when these athletes are doing all these spectacular things at the

811
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:07.920
Olympic Games,

812
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:11.280
it's not because they're using the drugs at the Olympics or just before the

813
00:49:11.281 --> 00:49:14.970
Olympics.
They've used them for five months during the off season.

814
00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:19.970
<v 3>What if we had an all roid Olympics?
Would it be much different?</v>

815
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:24.920
While the surveys show that that's what people really want
to,

816
00:49:24.921 --> 00:49:25.754
they really,
yeah.

817
00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:29.500
You can see that survey that was getting surveyed who is getting served.

818
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:32.100
That's all surveys suck.
Those every fucking,

819
00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:35.270
every poll that's ever existed sucks.
Your here was this survey

820
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:40.070
<v 5>be and it was before the 2004 Olympic Games and aphids and the question they ask</v>

821
00:49:40.071 --> 00:49:41.630
and it was a sports illustrated,
they said,

822
00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.840
would you rather see a new world record of 9.65 which would even be the record

823
00:49:48.021 --> 00:49:53.021
now by a guy that you knew was used to the gills or see a guy run 10 20 knowing

824
00:49:53.631 --> 00:49:57.080
he's completely clean.
70% said gimme the world record.

825
00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.200
<v 3>Wow,
that's weird.</v>

826
00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:02.920
I'd rather see a guy jumped like a mile up in the air then you know the seven

827
00:50:02.921 --> 00:50:04.060
feet.
Yeah.
Like,

828
00:50:04.061 --> 00:50:07.510
if there was a pill that you can take the actually turned you into the hulk and

829
00:50:07.511 --> 00:50:10.210
you could literally jump a mile into the air like the hulk could,

830
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:14.830
who wouldn't take that?
You need crazy not to take that.

831
00:50:14.831 --> 00:50:18.640
And you don't want to be the hub.
Really?
What's wrong with you?

832
00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:20.770
It's not meaning it have to smash everything,

833
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:25.290
but just knowing you could jump to a fucking,
you know,
the airplane,

834
00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.520
I would give that pill that David Lee Roth and immediately you're bulletproof

835
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.700
<v 1>and you can jump up to airplanes.
You don't want to do that.
Okay?</v>

836
00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:37.110
It's fuck is wrong with you,
becomes what the fuck is wrong with you.
Um,

837
00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:40.760
at any point in time while you're doing this and you're caught up,
you know,

838
00:50:40.761 --> 00:50:44.980
you're going from being totally natural to work with a clear to all of the

839
00:50:44.981 --> 00:50:47.780
sudden you'd give guys EPO and growth and all this different stuff.

840
00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:51.110
Does any point in time go,
man,
this is not what I set up to do.

841
00:50:51.111 --> 00:50:53.830
I just wanted to be in the hunt.
I did,
didn't know the hunt.

842
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:56.780
It wasn't like he didn't know the hunt was dirty until he got in it.

843
00:50:56.781 --> 00:50:58.910
And then once you run it and like,
well this is how you do business,

844
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:03.500
<v 5>you get that shirt.
I knew that it was dirty.
It was the,
you know,</v>

845
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:08.660
that rationale and I told you that I used before of you,

846
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:10.900
you feel that you've got to do which you,

847
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:14.900
you need to do in order to be competitive and it's the user lose.

848
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:18.620
If you don't use drugs then,

849
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:21.470
except for this rare freak that you mentioned that,

850
00:51:21.471 --> 00:51:23.990
that can do this without the use of drugs.

851
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:27.030
<v 1>Why?
No,
there's a lot of MMA fighters that don't use drugs.</v>

852
00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:31.320
They won't use drugs and they don't use drugs to maybe a small handful of them,

853
00:51:31.321 --> 00:51:35.040
but they're very proud of it.
Like Bj Penn obviously being one of the most vocal,

854
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:39.840
uh,
but there's,
there's a lot of guys who just won't.

855
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:44.010
But how many guys do you think are using?
My guests is about 50%.

856
00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:48.870
50% of MMA athletes or professional.
What about professional athletes?
Period?

857
00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.000
Depends on the sport.
Football.

858
00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:53.173
<v 4>Okay.</v>

859
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:56.470
<v 5>Tisdale's,
which I can't do it once again.
It's,</v>

860
00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:00.680
I want to go back and try to put this into perspective and I'll do it,

861
00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.400
cause I know the numbers with baseball,
but this would also apply to football.

862
00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.920
The major league players,

863
00:52:08.921 --> 00:52:13.921
union baseball player's Union contract with MLB enables them to test 375 players

864
00:52:18.221 --> 00:52:19.240
during the off season.

865
00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:23.560
So that's about 31% of all the players in the league.

866
00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.890
And this is during the off season.
They've agreed to this.

867
00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:31.150
If you go back and look at the last five years of statistics,

868
00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:35.080
you see that on average they only test about 50 players.

869
00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:40.380
So which is less than 5% so if those who receive the majority of the financial

870
00:52:41.351 --> 00:52:46.351
gain from major league baseball and control the drug testing have every right to

871
00:52:47.051 --> 00:52:51.400
test,
these players are at least 31% or 375 players.

872
00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:56.400
Why do they test only 50 and they tried to argue this with me.
And,

873
00:52:56.460 --> 00:53:00.490
and you know,
I've,
I know a lot of major league baseball players and I,

874
00:53:00.491 --> 00:53:04.060
and I talked to him and I know that there's a guy that's maybe one of the

875
00:53:04.061 --> 00:53:09.061
highest paid players in the history of the league and his entire career,

876
00:53:09.401 --> 00:53:13.360
which we won't say exactly,
but more than 15 year career,

877
00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:18.250
he's only been tested one time during the off season.
They just don't do it.

878
00:53:18.251 --> 00:53:20.170
What I'm saying is I believe there's,
they don't,

879
00:53:20.171 --> 00:53:23.350
they lack a genuine interest in catching these athletes.

880
00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:27.740
They want to promote this,
that they're for clean sport.
They wanted to,

881
00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:31.620
to uh,
you know,
they're trying to reduce the drugs,

882
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:36.330
but they just don't take their hook and line and Poland throw it in the pond to

883
00:53:36.331 --> 00:53:39.660
try to catch the fish when the fish are biting.
And why is that?

884
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:41.280
It's bad for business.

885
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:45.150
<v 1>So it's sort of a charade.
They pretend to try to clean up the sport,</v>

886
00:53:45.151 --> 00:53:46.950
but they really,
they have to keep it light,

887
00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:50.910
otherwise it'll ruin the game because the athletes need it in order to play at

888
00:53:50.911 --> 00:53:55.880
that level.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now I'm tracking field.
What percentage of traffic

889
00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:56.733
<v 5>and field they think,</v>

890
00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:01.390
well that's a history of really being dirty for a very long period of time.

891
00:54:01.391 --> 00:54:03.670
I mean,
uh,
where you can see this,

892
00:54:03.671 --> 00:54:08.671
and I'll give you an obvious example and that is with the women because they

893
00:54:09.011 --> 00:54:12.970
typically have about 10% the amount of testosterone compared to a male.

894
00:54:12.971 --> 00:54:16.720
So the effects are much greater on a woman than they are on a man.

895
00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:22.260
If you go back and look at the women's records in track and field 100 200400800

896
00:54:24.461 --> 00:54:28.930
1500 meter,
100 hurdles,
400 hurdles and those 70 events,

897
00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:34.920
the world and Olympic records are from the 1970s and eighties

898
00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:40.420
you got faster.
Mondo tracks now better spikes,

899
00:54:40.421 --> 00:54:44.770
all sorts of additional training equipment and you would expect them to run

900
00:54:44.771 --> 00:54:49.450
faster at the Olympic Games.
The winter runs around 49 seconds.
In the,

901
00:54:49.451 --> 00:54:54.451
in the 400 meter world record is 47 60 and I was like 12 meters faster.

902
00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:59.410
If you superimpose these records from the world and Olympic records compared to

903
00:54:59.411 --> 00:55:03.100
what they just did at the Olympic Games,
you would see that there.
It's,

904
00:55:03.101 --> 00:55:07.810
it's a joke.
They're there,
EH,
the world record in the hundred meters,
just 10 49.

905
00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:13.000
So they ran whatever it was,
10 78 or maybe 10 70.
Uh,

906
00:55:13.001 --> 00:55:17.560
the world record in the 200 2134 they run whatever it is,
2180,

907
00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:22.240
but it's five meters slower 30 years later.
So what does that tell you?

908
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:26.770
That obviously these records are tainted.
Wow.

909
00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:31.210
So,
and every time these athletes step up to the starting blocks,

910
00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:34.030
if you're an a at a world championships,
you're an Olympic Games,

911
00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.460
you see these records come up.

912
00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:40.540
So they're not just competing against the athletes in the lanes next to them.

913
00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:43.390
They're competing against these world and Olympic records,

914
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:45.160
which are obviously tainted.

915
00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:48.880
And all the women now in track and field complained about this routinely that,

916
00:55:48.881 --> 00:55:52.960
listen,
we can't get anywhere near these records.
So what does that mean?

917
00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:58.830
<v 1>So they,
WWF,
wait,</v>

918
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.710
can do ramp up and ramp up the Olympic track and field record book.
Yeah.

919
00:56:02.711 --> 00:56:04.090
What are you going to do with the Tour de France?

920
00:56:04.091 --> 00:56:07.600
They said that if they take it away from Lance Armstrong and you have to give it

921
00:56:07.601 --> 00:56:11.470
to the next runner up that didn't test positive on a drug test,

922
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:13.900
it would be 27th place.

923
00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:17.080
<v 5>Well,
there you go.
That's you know,</v>

924
00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:22.570
I don't know if you remember back in 2003 but this was right before balco was

925
00:56:22.571 --> 00:56:23.140
raided.

926
00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:27.940
I was helping a girl named Kelly White and she won was the first ever American

927
00:56:27.941 --> 00:56:32.770
to win double gold in the hundred and 200 meters.
Um,
here's what happened.

928
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:37.180
Uh,
after the,
and she shows she tested positive and they took the metals away.

929
00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:39.130
Within a short period of time,

930
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:42.910
the silver medalist tested positive and the bronze medal is tested positive.

931
00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:46.330
Now in that particular race of the eight girls,

932
00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:51.750
I believe that 100% of those girls were all on drugs.

933
00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:54.490
I personally gave five of those girls drugs.

934
00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:58.060
<v 3>What kind of drugs was given besides ecstasy?</v>

935
00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:01.840
Take performance enhancing drugs combination,

936
00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:05.620
give it to a lot of different things.
EPO,
growth,
hormone,
the clear,

937
00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.270
they're all on EPO.

938
00:57:07.271 --> 00:57:10.870
An EPO is essentially simulates what it's like to live at high altitude or your

939
00:57:10.871 --> 00:57:14.480
mouth produces more red blood cells.
You know,

940
00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:17.110
are you going to get the same types of results,

941
00:57:17.111 --> 00:57:21.490
training at high altitude that you will from from using EPO?
The answer's no.

942
00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:25.060
So epls more strong and much more powerful.
Wow.

943
00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:29.050
Like much more powerful.
Like how many times more powerful?
Well,

944
00:57:29.051 --> 00:57:32.250
let's say that a normal hematocrit is for,

945
00:57:32.251 --> 00:57:37.251
for females around 40 and for a male is around 45 43 what is hermatocrit exactly

946
00:57:38.651 --> 00:57:41.890
that same percentage of red blood cells to total whole blood volume.

947
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:44.620
You look at it and you spin it down in a centrifuge.

948
00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.680
The top 55% is is the

949
00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:52.660
<v 5>plasma or serum it's called and the bottom 45% is the pack cells.</v>

950
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:55.960
Now the word out there was that,
that you know Lance Armstrong,

951
00:57:56.050 --> 00:58:01.050
the target was about 55% but I've seen another thing you have to understand is

952
00:58:01.481 --> 00:58:06.040
that all anabolic steroids,
including the granddaddy of them,
all testosterone,

953
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:10.900
significantly increased red blood cell production.
And I've tested many,

954
00:58:10.901 --> 00:58:15.790
many of the top bodybuilders in the history of the sport.

955
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:21.070
And you see guys coming back at 57 58,
59% hematocrit,
very,

956
00:58:21.071 --> 00:58:24.250
very thick blood.
This is obviously dangerous.

957
00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:28.240
Well most of them are not taking EPL.
They get this,

958
00:58:28.241 --> 00:58:30.970
this increase in hematic rate from anabolic steroids.

959
00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:35.390
<v 3>So the antibiotics teller steroids increase endurance in the same exact way as</v>

960
00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:39.680
is capable of doing.
Is that what you're saying?
Yes.
Wow.
I didn't know that.

961
00:58:39.681 --> 00:58:42.710
But everybody thinks of steroids is actually being bad for your cardio when it

962
00:58:42.711 --> 00:58:45.320
comes to fighters because they put up so much muscle mass when they were on

963
00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:48.770
steroids and that demands resources and that means the blood vessels have to

964
00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:50.110
travel farther are there.

965
00:58:50.350 --> 00:58:54.280
<v 5>And the other thing that that's bad about that a lot of people don't understand</v>

966
00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:58.330
is,
and of course,
track and field,
they know this very well,

967
00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:03.630
is you are much stronger and much faster off steroids than on steroids.

968
00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:10.750
Really not.
Let me give you an example.
This guy,
uh,

969
00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:14.540
the 10 months,
same Tim Montgomery,
that,
that I helped at at one point,
uh,

970
00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:16.930
to break the world record and become the world's fastest human.

971
00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:22.260
He had bought $16,000 with the drugs in early the year and in 2000 he'd run

972
00:59:23.811 --> 00:59:28.710
about a little quicker than 10 flat and he run nine 92 and he said,
uh,

973
00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:31.220
listen,
I bought all these drugs,
I took all these drugs.

974
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:35.690
I'm running 10:20 AM two meters slower.
What's the deal?
He said,
Tim,

975
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:41.150
get off.
Just go off.
They work through cell volumization,

976
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:45.440
they pump you up,
they make you tight,
they make you slow.

977
00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:49.670
And they also don't understand some of the taper roster to freeze your strength.

978
00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.460
They increase your strength.
So tapering,

979
00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:56.060
maintain that strength every single for two weeks.
After you go off,

980
00:59:56.090 --> 00:59:58.160
you maintain 100% of the strength.

981
00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:03.230
But now you have a normal fluid balance and your muscles are much more relaxed

982
01:00:03.231 --> 01:00:04.700
and much faster

983
01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:08.860
<v 1>now.
So these,
the really hardcore steroids you're talking about,
like the,</v>

984
01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:13.240
the ones that people get tested for like extremely antabolic ones or basically

985
01:00:13.241 --> 01:00:13.540
even

986
01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:16.420
<v 5>regular testosterone.
All of them,
as you know,
they're all anabolic,</v>

987
01:00:16.421 --> 01:00:18.740
androgenic summer more one way or than the other.

988
01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:21.600
<v 1>And so is it just getting a certain amount of testosterone in your system and</v>

989
01:00:21.601 --> 01:00:22.434
that makes everything

990
01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:26.320
<v 5>off is the whole point.
Right?
You and a lot of guys don't understand.</v>

991
01:00:26.321 --> 01:00:30.280
He was trying to run fast while he was on.
And so what happened?

992
01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.810
He followed my advice.

993
01:00:31.811 --> 01:00:36.811
He went off and sure enough about three weeks later he ran two meters faster

994
01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:41.580
<v 1>being.
So it's because he kept the gains of being on the drugs,</v>

995
01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:45.120
but then the drug's negative effects wore off,
which is

996
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:49.910
<v 5>tight,
that when you're not,
you know,
you're much slower.</v>

997
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:54.330
So I don't care what you're doing,
if it would MMA fighting or,

998
01:00:54.331 --> 01:00:56.450
or playing baseball,
you,

999
01:00:56.451 --> 01:01:01.430
you would be much quicker by being off instead of on.

1000
01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:03.950
So I don't perform your best when you're on steroids.

1001
01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:04.331
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1002
01:01:04.331 --> 01:01:08.680
So steroids allow you to perform your best dirt because they build you up so

1003
01:01:08.681 --> 01:01:11.740
much in training that you almost have like supernatural strength.

1004
01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:15.730
And then when you're off of them,
then you perform at your best.
That's it.
Okay.

1005
01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:21.090
So it's a complicated sort of a timing situation with fighting isn't it?

1006
01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.080
They used to say 10 day taper,

1007
01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:27.330
<v 5>they used to say 10 day taper and,
and I believe in,</v>

1008
01:01:27.331 --> 01:01:29.690
and now I know that there are a number of,
or

1009
01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:34.390
<v 1>people that use believe the best is a 14 day taper now for,
um,</v>

1010
01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:36.930
for MMA fighters,

1011
01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:41.190
especially since MMA is such a controversial sport as this,

1012
01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.070
and there's so many instances of guys getting caught with PE ds,

1013
01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:49.470
it's so commonplace.
It's almost like every time the,
the tests come out,

1014
01:01:49.471 --> 01:01:52.980
all fighters tested for UFC one x and x,
whatever it is,

1015
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:57.210
I cross my fingers like please don't be fucking positive because so many guys

1016
01:01:57.211 --> 01:02:00.780
test positive,
but then you don't see them for a year and it's like,
ah,
it's,

1017
01:02:00.781 --> 01:02:04.850
it's annoying that guy like Overeem,
when he tested positive,
like,
you know,

1018
01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:08.190
the matches we missed out on because this guy has got to sit out for a year.

1019
01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:12.000
It's fucking,
it's crazy bad advice.
Yeah.
Well,

1020
01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:16.110
in his situation,
absolutely.
But you're,
you're working with guys.

1021
01:02:16.111 --> 01:02:20.520
He worked with Kyle Kingsbury and no Neato Donaire and no Neato fucking amazing.

1022
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.790
<v 3>The other night,
woof,
that kid is,
that kid is dynamite.</v>

1023
01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:28.110
He is one of the best living boxers right now.

1024
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:32.070
You're very smart boxer.
Yeah.
He could tell his timing,

1025
01:02:32.071 --> 01:02:36.510
his technique and he's also very aggressive and I'd love watching that kid
fight.

1026
01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:38.850
He is,
he is fantastic.
And you work it with him.

1027
01:02:38.851 --> 01:02:41.370
You worked with Kyle Kingsbury and who else are you working with them?

1028
01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:45.320
Well I Lee.
Okay.
Going away.
Um,

1029
01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:49.560
there are other top UFC fighters that uh,

1030
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.970
that do come to me and that I have tested and a consultation for and some of

1031
01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:56.590
these choose to keep it on the [inaudible] on the download.

1032
01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.540
And that's how I was going to ask you.

1033
01:02:57.550 --> 01:03:00.930
Since the MMA is such a controversial sport and you have this crazy past,

1034
01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.800
you know,
you're one of the few guys that actually did time for it,
you know,
uh,

1035
01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:08.040
what is it like when these guys,
you know,

1036
01:03:08.041 --> 01:03:10.430
when you approach these guys and have conversations with these guys,
is it,

1037
01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.490
are people reluctant to work?

1038
01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:16.230
We're very open and forgiving and I greatly appreciate that opportunity.

1039
01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:20.760
And others just are afraid of the,
the downside,
the stigma that,
you know,

1040
01:03:20.761 --> 01:03:22.500
they're gonna,
they're gonna think that they're on steroids.

1041
01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:26.880
Where in reality the guys that come to me and the guys that work with me are

1042
01:03:26.881 --> 01:03:28.680
probably some of the cleanest guys out there.

1043
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.500
Kyle Kingsbury's is a fucking awesome guy,
puts a,

1044
01:03:31.501 --> 01:03:36.370
it puts a target on their back up a little bit.
Right.
Kyle Kingsbury's what a,

1045
01:03:36.371 --> 01:03:38.940
what a nice guy that guy is and what a ballsy guy.

1046
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.700
I mean he's only been doing martial arts for a short amount of time.

1047
01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:45.240
It was essentially like a football player,
wasn't he?
Yeah.
Big.

1048
01:03:45.241 --> 01:03:48.030
He played football and Arabs,
they fucking super athlete kid.

1049
01:03:48.031 --> 01:03:51.360
What a stud and he started really learning how to fight in the,

1050
01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:55.150
the biggest organization in the world.
It's kind crazy cause he's,

1051
01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:58.680
he's a very ballsy dude for taking that up.
And he's a,
he's a great fighter.

1052
01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:02.160
He's just,
he's just a fucking heart and determination.
He's so tough.

1053
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.540
But I mean he's fighting guys like Galvet to Sherra.

1054
01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:08.870
Glover has just so many years of training and experience elements.

1055
01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:13.320
It's kind of crazy that Kyle is a fighting all these really,
really tough guys.

1056
01:04:13.321 --> 01:04:17.520
It's that he's taken a,
a wild road to mixed martial arts,

1057
01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:21.750
a success as a career.
He's got a tough road,

1058
01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:26.310
but he's a great guy.
And a you work with him and you work with know Nieto.

1059
01:04:26.311 --> 01:04:29.880
And what do you do for these guys?
Well,

1060
01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:34.860
the first thing is to test their blood and,
and um,
she,

1061
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:39.360
if there's any weak links and the nutritional chain and create a program that

1062
01:04:39.361 --> 01:04:41.580
will help them to achieve an optimal balance.

1063
01:04:41.581 --> 01:04:43.440
It's not about mega doses of anything.

1064
01:04:43.441 --> 01:04:47.490
It's just a correcting weak links or depletions and deficiencies.

1065
01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:52.110
And then secondly,
uh,
we have athletes where a memory belt,

1066
01:04:52.111 --> 01:04:57.030
which collects all sorts of different data.
Um,
caloric expenditure,

1067
01:04:57.031 --> 01:05:00.330
a Vo,
two Max ventilation.
Um,

1068
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:04.470
the training load,
uh,
you were,
while you work out,

1069
01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.560
you wear it around your chest.
Can you wear away spar

1070
01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.870
Jiu Jitsu,
kickboxing and everything.
It just doesn't,

1071
01:05:11.871 --> 01:05:14.530
it doesn't move or it doesn't even seem waterproof.
Of course guy,

1072
01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:17.980
you'd have to wear a shirt over the top of it.
But you know,
grappling,
it may

1073
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.680
<v 2>be a problem,
but a lot of guys that I work with have this.</v>

1074
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.260
And then we collect that data and,

1075
01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:26.470
and you can graphically display it on a big screen TV that we have in my

1076
01:05:26.471 --> 01:05:30.970
conference room and we,
it's an index of a,
of their physical fitness.

1077
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:33.640
We measure a lot of these um,

1078
01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:37.870
parameters that indicate overtraining.
I'm,
I'm just,

1079
01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:40.490
first thing I do is,
is,
uh,

1080
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:45.600
and it seems like most of the boxers and MMA fighters have this two a day,

1081
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.300
six days,
a week and Sundays off.

1082
01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.600
And it's just too much.

1083
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:57.630
And what I mean by that is you see immune system suppression,

1084
01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:01.990
their white blood cell count,

1085
01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:06.190
normal say is about seven and these guys will go outside the loan to the range

1086
01:06:06.191 --> 01:06:11.191
at foreign down into the threes is something we discovered with Kyle early on.

1087
01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.500
Said,
listen to you,
you're,
you're overtraining.
If you keep this up,

1088
01:06:14.501 --> 01:06:19.440
you're going to end up being sick.
So this more,
there is no pain,

1089
01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.640
there's no pain is just weakness leaving the body.
All the,

1090
01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:26.090
everybody has a different constitution.
What you do for training,
you know,

1091
01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:29.860
what works for you may be completely different than works for Kyle or no Neato

1092
01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:30.880
or anybody else.

1093
01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:36.100
So I don't like athletes training more than three days in a row.

1094
01:06:36.101 --> 01:06:40.690
So typically what I suggest is they train Monday,
Tuesday,
Wednesday,

1095
01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:43.810
Thursdays off.
When you say off,
um,
can you have an active rest day?

1096
01:06:43.811 --> 01:06:47.830
Like what if he just drilled technique and disliked a lot of times all want them

1097
01:06:47.831 --> 01:06:51.640
to do,
you know,
art therapy,
active release technologies,

1098
01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:55.210
therapy or tissue massage,
um,
you know,

1099
01:06:55.211 --> 01:07:00.211
but rest and recover and sleep in and then Friday and Saturday and Sunday.

1100
01:07:01.110 --> 01:07:03.310
So active release you're talking about,

1101
01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:06.340
that's where they put pressure at the actual point and they move the lamb

1102
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:10.540
instead of massaging,
they,
they actually move your good time massage type thing.

1103
01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:14.620
Yeah.
This is something that all the top guys,
tiger woods and,

1104
01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:18.490
and a rod and all these guys that were going to a guy named Mark Lens say,
who,

1105
01:07:18.491 --> 01:07:22.210
who,
uh,
is in Toronto.
He's one of the top guys in the country.

1106
01:07:22.211 --> 01:07:23.710
I met him through Romo,

1107
01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.890
but it's something a lot of people have been trained in under mark,

1108
01:07:26.891 --> 01:07:31.010
but he works with a lot of the hockey teams.
And so this is really a,
you know,

1109
01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:35.830
a lot of the top names are using art applied,
uh,
uh,

1110
01:07:36.270 --> 01:07:40.180
this,
this specific technology that applied release,
is that what it's called?

1111
01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.840
Technology active release tech activities technology.

1112
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:47.320
And the idea is just to keep everything loose or like what is it?

1113
01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:51.030
And sometimes they even have two people do it on you at the same time and hit

1114
01:07:51.031 --> 01:07:53.560
one will apply the pressure and the other will move the limb.

1115
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:58.060
And of course it's to open that up and free these toxins that accumulated in

1116
01:07:58.061 --> 01:08:01.660
various places of the body.
Toxins accumulate.
That's what it is.

1117
01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:02.950
When you're feeling sore,

1118
01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:07.750
there's a toxins or it's damaged metabolic waste byproducts is specifically what

1119
01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:12.540
it is.
That's what people don't quite understand about.
Um,

1120
01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:16.130
muscle soreness.
The use of EPO,
let's talk about

1121
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.963
<v 5>that for a minute.
Okay.</v>

1122
01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:22.120
Everybody thinks that it helps to deliver more oxygen molecules to muscle

1123
01:08:22.641 --> 01:08:26.780
tissue.
And it does,
but it's two way street,

1124
01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:28.010
meaning once,

1125
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:29.010
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1126
01:08:29.010 --> 01:08:32.280
<v 5>the red blood cell is there and dumping the oxygen,</v>

1127
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:36.540
it picks up lactic acid,
ammonia,
carbon dioxide,

1128
01:08:36.541 --> 01:08:39.450
these metabolic waste byproducts and removes those.

1129
01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:43.800
So you're delaying the onset,
the accumulation of lactic acid.

1130
01:08:43.801 --> 01:08:48.240
So it really helps with endurance.
Not because it's just delivering the oxygen,

1131
01:08:48.241 --> 01:08:51.150
but because it's removing these metabolic waste,

1132
01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:54.870
which are toxic byproducts from the system.
And interesting.

1133
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:56.263
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1134
01:08:56.330 --> 01:08:59.420
<v 3>So these different various drugs,</v>

1135
01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.540
some of them are still not illegal,
is that correct?

1136
01:09:02.541 --> 01:09:06.770
As an EPO still they don't test for it in certain places.

1137
01:09:06.771 --> 01:09:09.310
The state commissions don't test for it.
So that's,

1138
01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:14.240
that's my big argument about what the state commissions are doing is,
is the the,

1139
01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.700
they don't test for EPO.
Yeah,
I read that and I'm like,

1140
01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:20.120
I heard they don't test for that was,
that's a crazy thing for growth hormone.

1141
01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:25.100
They don't test for synthetic testosterone.
So when they say,
wow,

1142
01:09:25.101 --> 01:09:28.010
these guys are getting busted,
you know,
all the time.

1143
01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:31.340
Could you imagine if they had effective testing?
What would be going on?

1144
01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:34.070
So these guys are getting busted because they're dumb.
Is that what it is?

1145
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:36.050
They're just,
they're doing something dumb.
They're not,

1146
01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.240
they're not talking to a guy,

1147
01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:41.330
a knowledgeable guy that could sort of read their blood work and tell them

1148
01:09:41.331 --> 01:09:45.260
beforehand whether or not they're taking them out the right amount of time off

1149
01:09:45.261 --> 01:09:46.090
of it.
Is that what it is?

1150
01:09:46.090 --> 01:09:49.880
Let's talk about a specific case to illustrate what you just said.
Okay.

1151
01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:52.740
Lamont Peterson and the boxer that,
uh,

1152
01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:57.260
tested positive for synthetic testosterone.
Yes.
He went,
you work with them car?

1153
01:09:57.261 --> 01:09:58.460
No,
you don't.
No,

1154
01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:03.080
<v 5>but Vada the group that does testing is the one that busted him for synthetic</v>

1155
01:10:03.081 --> 01:10:04.490
testosterone.
But here's what happened.

1156
01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:09.680
He went to a doctor in Las Vegas and his,

1157
01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:10.700
his,
uh,

1158
01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:15.470
total testosterone was five 63 perfectly normal loan under the ranges depending

1159
01:10:15.471 --> 01:10:20.270
upon lab with various lab,
your lab at like two 50 to 300.
So he's at five 63,

1160
01:10:20.271 --> 01:10:23.860
perfectly normal.
They found his free testosterone.
The,

1161
01:10:23.861 --> 01:10:28.670
the active portion that binds to the energy and receptor was a little bit low.

1162
01:10:28.671 --> 01:10:30.650
Well that could have been,
you know,

1163
01:10:30.651 --> 01:10:35.640
he was overtraining and all he needed was a few days of rest.
But this doctor,
uh,

1164
01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:36.523
told him,

1165
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:38.080
<v 4>okay,</v>

1166
01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.690
<v 5>let's just put this testosterone pellet in you.</v>

1167
01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:45.280
So they made a little surgical incision,
inserted a palette.

1168
01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:49.480
This palette time releases about seven milligrams a day,

1169
01:10:49.481 --> 01:10:53.450
which is about your body's normal production.
And,
and they,

1170
01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:56.250
you don't even need a stitch,
they just put a little butterfly over.

1171
01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:01.680
So he fights Amir Khan for the world title and they test him and he's negative.

1172
01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:07.030
Now in Nevada,
in New York,

1173
01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:11.200
in Washington DC,
they use the 61 to e ratio.

1174
01:11:12.010 --> 01:11:14.430
So he was well below,
there was no issues.

1175
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:19.290
<v 2>Soon as he enrolled in Nevada testing where they,
this is what they do,</v>

1176
01:11:19.291 --> 01:11:21.890
that's different than other testing,
uh,

1177
01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:24.690
associations is every single sample.

1178
01:11:24.691 --> 01:11:27.840
They use the cir carbon isotope ratio testing,

1179
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:33.120
which can differentiate between endogenous production and exoticness

1180
01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:37.020
testosterone,
whether it be patched cream,
clear injection.
Okay.

1181
01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:42.530
So his tee ratio came back at 3.77 to one will.

1182
01:11:43.921 --> 01:11:48.600
Even the highest Olympic standard is four to one he is negative,
right,

1183
01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.900
but if you use this more sophisticated technology,

1184
01:11:52.410 --> 01:11:56.750
he came back and they identified that he had synthetic testosterone and his

1185
01:11:56.751 --> 01:11:59.040
system and of course later it came out.
Oh by the way,

1186
01:11:59.041 --> 01:12:02.490
I've got this pellet and my butt and,
and here's the reason.

1187
01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:07.760
Now I was told by somebody that I know that referred him to a doctor.

1188
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.410
It has to be a doctor.
It's that said,

1189
01:12:10.411 --> 01:12:14.010
don't be surprised if there's a hundred boxers out there that have these pellets

1190
01:12:14.011 --> 01:12:14.844
in there button.

1191
01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:19.040
Now this pellet thing is a new thing I just heard about this couple.

1192
01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:22.530
The first time I heard about it was a couple of months ago and I thought someone

1193
01:12:22.531 --> 01:12:23.990
was joking with me.
No,
they,

1194
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:27.510
they insert a bunch of pellets in them and they slowly dissolve and I was like,

1195
01:12:27.511 --> 01:12:31.740
that's fucking time released and typically you have to replace the pellet every

1196
01:12:31.741 --> 01:12:35.250
five months.
I can feel it in my butt.
I was like,
what are you doing?

1197
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:38.910
Get bigger ones.
If you want one,
well,
they have different doses,

1198
01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:43.920
decides to go have different strengths,
200 milligram through 800 milligram.

1199
01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:45.410
Oh really?
Interesting.

1200
01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:49.110
So now what do you think about testosterone replacement for professional

1201
01:12:49.111 --> 01:12:49.591
athletes?

1202
01:12:49.591 --> 01:12:53.880
It's a very controversial subject and one of the reasons is there's guys that

1203
01:12:53.881 --> 01:12:56.070
are in their twenties that are on it.
Well,

1204
01:12:56.100 --> 01:13:00.780
let's talk about that for a minute and I don't want to try to shed some new

1205
01:13:00.781 --> 01:13:03.870
light on that because I've heard a lot of arguments.

1206
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:05.700
I watched a little bit of your segment,

1207
01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:09.520
which Hell Sona and now he's saying it's legal,
it's legal,
you know,

1208
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:13.290
and be able to do this and and so on.
Um,

1209
01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:15.330
I don't think he's right.
Uh,
he,

1210
01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:19.090
he obviously was suspended in the state of California.

1211
01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:22.110
Whatever he did wasn't,
not only was it not legal,

1212
01:13:22.111 --> 01:13:24.270
I guess now if he's using it and,

1213
01:13:24.271 --> 01:13:28.200
and he is regulated by the state that he fights him and he's got a therapeutic

1214
01:13:28.201 --> 01:13:31.680
use exemption.
It is legal.
Yeah.
Okay.

1215
01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:34.050
But I know when he was suspended,

1216
01:13:34.051 --> 01:13:36.840
it was not when he fought Sylvan in the state of California.

1217
01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:40.710
But here's something that I want to talk about for just a minute.

1218
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:45.720
With anabolic steroids.
Every single steroid,

1219
01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:50.400
the test is qualitative.
It's not quantitative.

1220
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:55.530
Many,
you can't have a certain amount and it's okay like caffeine,

1221
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:58.530
but if you have too much and there's an allowable limit,

1222
01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:04.160
so if you've got a microscopic part per trillion and it's even there and it can

1223
01:14:04.291 --> 01:14:08.430
be identified,
that's it.
Your band,
it's a prohibited substance.

1224
01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:12.850
Well,
in the case of TRT,
when you're talking about,

1225
01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:15.310
and they use the word bio identical,

1226
01:14:15.311 --> 01:14:20.311
that's a very misleading term because that's what this doctor told Lamont

1227
01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:23.470
Peterson.
Well,
it's bio identical.
They won't cause a positive test.

1228
01:14:23.471 --> 01:14:27.430
You can take this stuff.
He has no clue what he's talking about.
Okay.

1229
01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:34.000
The background is this.
Your body makes testosterone out of cholesterol,

1230
01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:39.460
all forms,
injectable patches,
creams,
clear,
uh,
patches,

1231
01:14:39.461 --> 01:14:42.100
whatever it is,
the delivery system,

1232
01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:46.270
it's either made out of soy based plant or Yam.

1233
01:14:47.290 --> 01:14:52.090
So they use a test that's carbon isotope ratio test where they look at what they

1234
01:14:52.091 --> 01:14:54.700
call the [inaudible] 13 [inaudible] 12 ratio,

1235
01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:00.240
and they can differentiate between endogenous and exogenous.

1236
01:15:00.431 --> 01:15:04.390
Your body produced it or it's coming from outside and it's a year,

1237
01:15:04.391 --> 01:15:06.580
either positive or you're not.
Right.

1238
01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:11.590
So if it's even there and your body didn't produce it for all anabolic steroids,

1239
01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:16.900
you're suspended.
It's the same thing with,
with TRT.
It's,

1240
01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:21.340
it's a foreign substance.
Your Body didn't make it.
It's coming from outside.

1241
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:25.600
Make sense?
So it's not about being quantitative,
meaning well,

1242
01:15:25.601 --> 01:15:28.270
you can have only a certain amount in your urine.
Now,

1243
01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:33.190
and I want to talk about this for a minute,
of up to four to one.
That's not true.

1244
01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:36.790
If the testers use this carbon isotope ratio test,

1245
01:15:36.791 --> 01:15:38.290
I'm gonna give you a specific example.

1246
01:15:38.530 --> 01:15:43.530
In 2006 Justin Gatlin who won the gold medal in 2004 and the 100 meters,

1247
01:15:45.490 --> 01:15:50.490
somebody drop dime on him and they said this guy is using testosterone.

1248
01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:54.280
So they went to him based on this intelligence,

1249
01:15:54.281 --> 01:15:56.630
collected a sample and it came back.

1250
01:15:56.631 --> 01:15:59.680
He t ratio was 0.5 to one.

1251
01:15:59.950 --> 01:16:04.210
It was lower than one to one yet with carbon isotope ratio.

1252
01:16:04.211 --> 01:16:09.211
They found out this guy used this exogenous form of testosterone and they banned

1253
01:16:10.421 --> 01:16:12.850
him.
This make sense?

1254
01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:14.520
<v 3>Yeah,
I understand that.
But that's the Olympics.</v>

1255
01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:18.030
The Nevada State Athletic Commission allows for testosterone replacement.

1256
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:21.060
What is drawing a pedic use exemption.
Right,

1257
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:25.800
but with a therapeutic use exemption will fade.
Go to them.
The doctor says,
Hey,

1258
01:16:25.801 --> 01:16:27.150
this guy's got low testosterone.

1259
01:16:27.151 --> 01:16:29.760
There's a bunch of fighters that are operating under that now.
It's not unique.

1260
01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:33.310
So that's not the Olympics.
You're talking about these guys or no,

1261
01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:37.820
he's the Olympics.
You're talking about MMA or boxing commission?

1262
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:41.760
I'm talking about this.
I'm talking about fighters.
If they have an exemption,

1263
01:16:42.150 --> 01:16:44.310
then it's legal,
like chill said.
Right,

1264
01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:48.300
but so even though it's not produced by your body,

1265
01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:52.310
even though it is a foreign substance,
it's still not,
she had a prescription.

1266
01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.720
They could use any other way,

1267
01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:58.720
<v 2>one of the available tremble loan or are Primo Bolen or parable on our or any</v>

1268
01:16:58.721 --> 01:17:00.750
other steroid.
If a doctor Said said,

1269
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:04.590
<v 3>you can use this and you could get a therapeutic use exemption and use it,</v>

1270
01:17:04.650 --> 01:17:06.410
could you?
Of course,

1271
01:17:06.450 --> 01:17:10.490
you sure can you get a therapeutic use exemption for steroids or can you only

1272
01:17:10.491 --> 01:17:13.220
get a therapeutic use exemption for testosterone replacement?

1273
01:17:14.050 --> 01:17:17.530
It seems like it's only you replacing what actually exists.

1274
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:22.190
It's medically indicated for.
So do they give,
uh,

1275
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:25.700
AIDS patients for wasting syndrome?
Do they give them other sorts of skills?

1276
01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:28.060
You don't need medical needs.
The answer's yes.
Well,

1277
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:32.120
hyperactive people can't even take a,
like,
you can't even take Ritalin.

1278
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:36.980
Like you can't take a,
what is the one that everybody loves?
Adderall.

1279
01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.540
Adderall,
that Adderall stuff.

1280
01:17:39.230 --> 01:17:42.140
Apparently there's something called [inaudible] Gill.
Do you know what that is?

1281
01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.790
It's provigil.
Provigil modafinil.
That's,

1282
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:48.730
that's what I got busted for.
Did you really?
Wow.

1283
01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:51.500
How was the first guy that was given us to world class athletes?

1284
01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.320
That's what Kelly,
that's house for.
Yeah.

1285
01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:56.900
This is what they give to the fighter pilots and helicopter pilots and they use

1286
01:17:56.901 --> 01:17:58.490
it in the military.
That's what I get.

1287
01:17:58.491 --> 01:18:02.240
That's the first positive test that came down associated with me was Kelly White

1288
01:18:02.241 --> 01:18:06.260
with provigil in 2003.
Provigil is what,
uh,
Dave Asprey texts.

1289
01:18:06.261 --> 01:18:09.140
He didn't tell us that.
Yeah.
It's called a wakefulness promoting agent.

1290
01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.800
That date crazy bulletproof exec guy that got it takes provigil it takes me like

1291
01:18:12.801 --> 01:18:16.310
every day there's a whole video of him promoting it and they make them not take

1292
01:18:16.311 --> 01:18:19.310
it for a couple of days and he's talking about how cloudy is and then he takes

1293
01:18:19.311 --> 01:18:20.690
it and he works 20 hours a day.

1294
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:23.750
Like there's a little more to his story that when he was telling us,

1295
01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:28.010
I feel like he left that out.
Yeah,
that's pretty important.

1296
01:18:28.011 --> 01:18:31.820
That is pretty important.
I think it's like a form of kind of like an Adderall.

1297
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:35.300
Is that what it is?
And more intense Saturday.
I don't know if it's more intense.

1298
01:18:35.301 --> 01:18:38.570
I just think it's different.
It sounds pretty in government's involved.

1299
01:18:38.571 --> 01:18:42.940
It's probably the more intense,
I think everybody,
I think a lot of silica,
the uh,

1300
01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.770
the argument was that a lot of silicone valley exec sir,

1301
01:18:45.771 --> 01:18:48.920
our high on this stuff all day long.
I need to get him college students.

1302
01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:49.880
College students.
Yeah.

1303
01:18:49.881 --> 01:18:53.450
There was an article that said how many Silicone Valley exacts or hop up on

1304
01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:57.560
provigil provigil provigil apparently it's the fucking drug of choice.

1305
01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.240
He told he didn't tell us about that.
He's like,

1306
01:18:59.241 --> 01:19:01.450
I'm eating Yak meat and shit like calming effect.

1307
01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:04.770
You're on fucking speed kind of hearing you gotta eat,
can't hear every day.

1308
01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:10.070
He was talking to us about all these great things and I really believe him about

1309
01:19:10.071 --> 01:19:13.460
all those great things.
But I think the speed helps him too.
Yeah,

1310
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:16.160
that's probably the number one thing.
The you're,

1311
01:19:16.161 --> 01:19:20.600
you're on top of shit because you're unfucking speed man.
If the difference,

1312
01:19:20.601 --> 01:19:21.321
but awesome.
Speed.

1313
01:19:21.321 --> 01:19:24.950
I hear the difference with Olympic caliber testing and what the Nevada state

1314
01:19:24.951 --> 01:19:28.460
athletic commission is doing,
giving these guys these TRTs is,

1315
01:19:28.461 --> 01:19:33.230
it's completely different standard.
I mean,
I don't think any of these,

1316
01:19:33.231 --> 01:19:38.000
these guys that the six or whatever it is,
MMA fighters that have these,

1317
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:42.280
these therapeutic use exemptions for testosterone,
Nevada,
there's a lot ever.

1318
01:19:42.281 --> 01:19:43.940
It is whatever it is,

1319
01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:48.320
the number in Olympic sport,
uh,

1320
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:53.570
for who knows a hundred thousand athletes,
you know,

1321
01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.330
there's ten thousand eleven thousand that compete at the Olympics.

1322
01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:59.750
The total in that group is something like 24.

1323
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:05.240
You've already got 10 out of 375 guys and,
and,

1324
01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:08.220
and the UFC.
Yeah.

1325
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.590
<v 1>But you also have to deal with the fact that these guys are,</v>

1326
01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:14.190
they're getting a lot of head trauma and head trauma reduces your body's ability

1327
01:20:14.191 --> 01:20:17.790
to produce testosterone.
Right.
I agree that that's certainly a factor.
Yeah,

1328
01:20:17.791 --> 01:20:22.340
that's it.
That's a sort of a,
an unknown factor.
And that's happening too.

1329
01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:26.370
That's one of the reasons for depression and a lot of athletes that have gotten

1330
01:20:26.371 --> 01:20:30.480
a lot of head trauma,
the pituitary gland is apparently very sensitive.
It's not,

1331
01:20:30.570 --> 01:20:33.000
it doesn't like get knocked the fuck out.
And you know,

1332
01:20:33.001 --> 01:20:37.140
if it happens a few times it could,
it can get damaged and it can,
uh,

1333
01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:40.080
it can stop your,
your ability to produce hormones that are regular rate

1334
01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:44.360
<v 2>and,
and if it's a proper medical diagnosis,</v>

1335
01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:49.520
which takes about four months to be properly done,

1336
01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:54.640
not,
you know,
one test and hey,
everything looks good and,
and,

1337
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:55.880
and get the subscription.

1338
01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:59.570
I mean there's all sorts of things that if you wanted to manipulate the system,

1339
01:20:59.571 --> 01:21:00.590
you use steroids.

1340
01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:03.980
It suppresses your endogenous production to get a low reading and you get a

1341
01:21:03.981 --> 01:21:08.200
scrip.
Yes,
that's common sewing all.
It's very easy to,

1342
01:21:08.201 --> 01:21:12.710
to to trick the system if the standard is very low like it is in Nevada

1343
01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:16.860
<v 1>and also the ethical way to treat a patient would be to try to address their</v>

1344
01:21:16.861 --> 01:21:21.420
nutrition and minerals and vitamins first before you would introduce some sort

1345
01:21:21.421 --> 01:21:24.720
of IG.
Dot.
What is it x dodginess how you say exogenous,

1346
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:28.650
exogenous for you introduce a foreign form of hormone.

1347
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.250
<v 2>That's exactly what I said about Lamont Peterson.</v>

1348
01:21:31.251 --> 01:21:36.251
When the guy one test and I put the pellet in rest of the guy for a week and

1349
01:21:36.651 --> 01:21:38.300
come back and take a second measurement,

1350
01:21:38.301 --> 01:21:43.180
makes sure before you do this procedure and they,
it's just,
you know,
wham Bam.

1351
01:21:43.181 --> 01:21:47.870
And,
and,
and then they're in and,
and it is what it is and it's,
uh,

1352
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:53.020
it's something that I'm not sure it may or may not be medically indicated in,

1353
01:21:53.021 --> 01:21:56.390
in each one of these cases where the,
these guys are being granted the,

1354
01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:57.250
these exemptions,

1355
01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:57.611
<v 1>the,</v>

1356
01:21:57.611 --> 01:22:02.380
the issue be it sort of gets to a point where the door's already open.

1357
01:22:02.381 --> 01:22:06.720
So now what it's like when he got [inaudible] and,
uh,
Dan Henderson,

1358
01:22:06.730 --> 01:22:09.610
these are the,
you know,
the vocal ones who have,
uh,

1359
01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:13.690
talked openly about it and it's quite a few other guys that did to fill Forrest

1360
01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:16.120
Griffin was just on it for his last fight and you know,

1361
01:22:16.150 --> 01:22:18.640
becomes one of those issues where you're like,
okay,
uh,

1362
01:22:18.641 --> 01:22:22.630
at what point in time did we take a look at this cause one of two things is

1363
01:22:22.631 --> 01:22:25.300
going on,
right?
These guys are in their thirties,
they need testosterone.

1364
01:22:25.301 --> 01:22:29.650
So it's either they're taking damage and the damages is messing up their body.

1365
01:22:29.651 --> 01:22:33.370
And if that's the case,
should they really be competing combat sports.

1366
01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:36.080
And if they,
if the only way for them to compete at their,

1367
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:39.850
their own best level and combat sports is to take hormones.

1368
01:22:40.150 --> 01:22:44.530
It might be time to compete this top competing in combat sports.
I mean you,
you,

1369
01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:44.861
you know,

1370
01:22:44.861 --> 01:22:48.170
if you want to live the rest of your life and take synthetic hormones and,

1371
01:22:48.171 --> 01:22:50.260
and feel better because you take them,
that's one thing.

1372
01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:53.050
But maybe you shouldn't be getting hit in the head anymore too.

1373
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:55.420
And someone needs to say that at a certain point in time,

1374
01:22:55.421 --> 01:22:58.070
there should be a masters category over a certain age.
What?

1375
01:22:58.090 --> 01:23:02.680
It should be a reason why.
Why is it 25 year old man on testosterone?

1376
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:06.070
What's going on?
You need to tell him you need gotta be a reason.

1377
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:10.570
<v 3>And it can't simply be that he took testosterone for a while and fucked up his</v>

1378
01:23:10.571 --> 01:23:15.280
balls because that seems to me that's,
that's like,
you know,

1379
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:17.890
that's a,
that's a mess.
Like if fee,
if you do that,

1380
01:23:17.891 --> 01:23:20.440
I mean I'm not saying that you shouldn't ever be able to compete anymore,

1381
01:23:20.441 --> 01:23:22.930
but I'm kind of saying that because you,

1382
01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:27.010
you're going to always have a level that's like constant and consistent and

1383
01:23:27.011 --> 01:23:29.680
artificial and it has nothing to do with your,
you know,

1384
01:23:29.681 --> 01:23:31.720
how you're taking care of your body.

1385
01:23:31.721 --> 01:23:33.820
It has to do with what you're sticking in a CC,

1386
01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:39.110
where you're sticking in a needle that gets a little weird and when they argue

1387
01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:43.500
about,
well it's the standard deviation.
I hear Keith Kaiser talk about,

1388
01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:44.770
well I'm worried about this guy,

1389
01:23:44.771 --> 01:23:48.940
this one out of 500 or one out of a thousand that may have this level and you

1390
01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:49.300
know,

1391
01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:53.140
how about all the other guys that are competing against guys that may have a

1392
01:23:53.141 --> 01:23:57.610
competitive advantage because they've hoodwinked the system to get,
you know,

1393
01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:00.040
a competitive edge by using testosterone.

1394
01:24:00.190 --> 01:24:03.340
How about giving vision checks for those people that you have for judges?

1395
01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:06.130
How about that?
How about asking them what is it?
What's a triangle?

1396
01:24:06.131 --> 01:24:09.370
A Clark can show me on somebody when a triangle looks like and his elk here,

1397
01:24:09.371 --> 01:24:12.400
or is he in trouble?
What's going on here?
This is a choke or is this not a choke?

1398
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:15.970
This is t cause this kind of about the top or is this nothing you do you even

1399
01:24:15.971 --> 01:24:17.680
fucking know.
There's some of that,

1400
01:24:17.681 --> 01:24:19.750
some of the scorecards that come in and you just go,

1401
01:24:19.751 --> 01:24:24.751
how is that even possible that in the super bowl of MMA at the top of the peak,

1402
01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:29.080
these athletic commissions are providing these judges and they're providing them

1403
01:24:29.081 --> 01:24:33.700
over and over again and the same ones make terrible decisions after terrible

1404
01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:37.750
decisions he needs.
They need to clean up a lot of that shit.
I agree.

1405
01:24:37.810 --> 01:24:42.220
It drives me fucking crazy when I see a guy fight his heart out and I see a bad

1406
01:24:42.221 --> 01:24:46.990
decision that drives me nuts.
Man.
That is a sad,
sad thing to see,

1407
01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:51.610
to see in competence and nonsense cost someone a victory and to see that look on

1408
01:24:51.611 --> 01:24:53.650
their face.
Like I know I fucking beat that guy.

1409
01:24:53.651 --> 01:24:56.380
And then you go over the watch the tape.
But maybe I was biased.

1410
01:24:56.381 --> 01:24:59.420
Maybe I was there.
Maybe.
Maybe I was looking at it the wrong way.

1411
01:24:59.421 --> 01:25:02.110
And let me watch it again.
And you watch it again.
It's like what the fuck?

1412
01:25:02.111 --> 01:25:07.030
Who the fuck was,
it doesn't even make any sense in a word.

1413
01:25:07.031 --> 01:25:11.030
What you just said too about all of the above is it's a mess.
Yeah.
It's,

1414
01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:13.930
everything's a mess,
right?
Politics are a mess.
This is a mass,

1415
01:25:13.931 --> 01:25:17.530
the Olympics or mass,
all of it's a mess.
So you,

1416
01:25:17.531 --> 01:25:22.060
what you do with these guys like Kyle Kingsbury and no Neato Dinair is a,

1417
01:25:22.061 --> 01:25:27.061
you keep them on the straight and narrow with the best possible legal ways of

1418
01:25:27.581 --> 01:25:31.180
helping your body.
Yes.
And to make sure they're not,

1419
01:25:31.181 --> 01:25:34.510
what does Zma Zinc,
magnesium,

1420
01:25:34.511 --> 01:25:36.400
what else is in the zinc,

1421
01:25:36.401 --> 01:25:41.170
magnesium and vitamin B six and its specific forms of zinc and magnesium that

1422
01:25:41.171 --> 01:25:43.380
are very bioavailable and uh,

1423
01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:47.710
it's actually the very first product that was introduced to the sports nutrition

1424
01:25:47.711 --> 01:25:49.150
market,
uh,

1425
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:54.040
to specifically enhance sleep efficiency and a product that you take at night

1426
01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:58.150
before you go to bed and it boost testosterone to it,
doesn't it?
Well,

1427
01:25:58.270 --> 01:26:02.890
a number of things happen during sleep.
Uh,

1428
01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:03.793
the

1429
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.110
<v 2>first time that you're,</v>

1430
01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:10.120
you'd go through about three cycles of five stages and when you get to,

1431
01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:16.430
it looks like three years in a row.
So when you get to the bottom of this,

1432
01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:20.750
it's called Delta or slow wave or stage three,
stage four sleep.

1433
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:22.460
The first time that you're,

1434
01:26:22.670 --> 01:26:27.560
you go into this very deep sleep where your heart rate is significantly reduced,

1435
01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:33.040
70% of your body's out daily output of growth hormone is released in a,

1436
01:26:33.311 --> 01:26:37.100
in a single burst.
This mass that they can measure.

1437
01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.520
And there's all sorts of things that,
um,

1438
01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:45.640
light sound temperature that can affect you not going into a very deep sleep.

1439
01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:51.470
So that's one of the things is to target relaxing the body with magnesium and

1440
01:26:51.471 --> 01:26:53.960
getting you into a very deep and restful sleep.

1441
01:26:53.961 --> 01:26:57.450
And the little bit of B six is to double the absorption of both the,

1442
01:26:57.500 --> 01:26:58.970
the zinc and magnesium.

1443
01:26:59.210 --> 01:27:03.860
So the first half of sleep is when most of your daily output of growth hormone

1444
01:27:03.861 --> 01:27:04.694
is released.

1445
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:09.410
The second four hours is when your system produces testosterone.

1446
01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:13.070
So this is why guys wake up with a woody,
uh,

1447
01:27:13.071 --> 01:27:17.120
your testosterone level is double in the morning compared to what it is in the

1448
01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:17.953
evening.

1449
01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:23.410
So I realized that when do you maximize tissue repair,

1450
01:27:23.481 --> 01:27:25.640
healing,
recovery,
regeneration,

1451
01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:28.700
and that's at night when you're sleeping.

1452
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:34.160
So that's why I put together that formula.
It was instantly a very huge success.

1453
01:27:34.161 --> 01:27:38.060
Selling hundreds of thousands of bottles a month and now there's over 130

1454
01:27:38.061 --> 01:27:41.740
companies selling it worldwide.
It's everywhere and it's,

1455
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:47.480
there was no competition.
You had pre workout,
post workout,
meal replacements,

1456
01:27:47.481 --> 01:27:52.310
diet supplements,
but not asleep product.
So when it got introduced,

1457
01:27:52.311 --> 01:27:56.170
uh,
it became very successful and continues to be very successful.

1458
01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:57.350
You heard a secretary open,

1459
01:27:58.690 --> 01:28:02.560
<v 1>it's a new light bulbs,
Somol growth hormone replacement.</v>

1460
01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:06.100
You spray it on your tongue.
That's a arginine.
All these different,
the,

1461
01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:09.720
you think it works?
I don't know.
I don't think it does.
No.
I think this one has,

1462
01:28:09.721 --> 01:28:14.200
one has tasks behind that.
It's by a doctor,
Dr. Mark Gordon.
He's the guy that,
uh,

1463
01:28:14.201 --> 01:28:17.740
was famous for working with James Tony and a bunch of other athletes,

1464
01:28:18.010 --> 01:28:20.920
works with a lot of us soldiers that have traumatic brain injury.

1465
01:28:21.450 --> 01:28:23.280
If the basis is Arginine,

1466
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:25.390
<v 2>the original song,
don't listen to me,
dude,</v>

1467
01:28:25.391 --> 01:28:28.060
where they show the connection between our Janine and,

1468
01:28:28.110 --> 01:28:31.120
and growth hormone levels was an Italian study.

1469
01:28:31.450 --> 01:28:36.450
But to get any increase in growth hormone took 17 grams or 17,000 milligrams of

1470
01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:41.200
arginine.
You'd have to take a whole bottle.

1471
01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.970
<v 1>Yeah.
No,
that's,
it's,
there's something about the way.
Um,
they've,
uh,
they've,</v>

1472
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:50.570
they've made us light bulbs,
so delivery,
um,

1473
01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:54.760
something about the way they've used frequency to ceiling wall.
Yeah.

1474
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:58.880
But the way they've managed to make the molecule smaller by some,

1475
01:28:58.910 --> 01:29:02.130
some sort of a process.
It was explained to me by a guy way

1476
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:04.080
<v 3>fucking smarter than me.
But uh,</v>

1477
01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:08.620
because of the fact that it fits into your blood cells,
that in this light bill,

1478
01:29:08.621 --> 01:29:11.730
some old delivery,
that it actually is effective supposedly,

1479
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.170
but it's a bunch of amino acids and other different things that they've shown in

1480
01:29:16.171 --> 01:29:20.100
clinical tests of over 11 different years of a bunch of various tasks that,

1481
01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:23.400
that it's effective.
Do you need a prescription for your boner cream?

1482
01:29:23.970 --> 01:29:28.890
You have Boehner cream,
I mean,
steroid cream for men.
Zma is not a boner cream.

1483
01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:33.810
No.
The stuff that you put on at night,
this Zma Zinc,
magnesium helps.

1484
01:29:34.210 --> 01:29:37.840
We have two forums is can you have a quiz?
You know,
we have a,
uh,

1485
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:41.220
a powdered drink.
Oh,
okay.
You can't see,
cause if you had a Korean,

1486
01:29:41.221 --> 01:29:46.140
Brian would beat off.
Why'd you think it was a great hire?
He said boner.
Well,

1487
01:29:46.141 --> 01:29:50.170
it's uh,
it's minerals,
right?
I mean,
are amino acids right?
It's and then rolls in.

1488
01:29:50.171 --> 01:29:54.750
It does have my fine and,
and some amino acids in it.
Yes.
Aspartic acid.
It does.

1489
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:57.180
I know.
Argentines good to take at night too,
right,
isn't it?

1490
01:29:57.630 --> 01:30:01.100
There's a lot of things that you should take at night that are really,
I,

1491
01:30:01.150 --> 01:30:05.580
you know,
I'm a big fan of,
of a case in my cellar protein to take at night.

1492
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:09.570
There's other better forms like whey protein isolates that have a higher rate of

1493
01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:13.620
prose protein synthesis that to take immediately after you work out.

1494
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:14.880
But when you're sleeping,

1495
01:30:14.881 --> 01:30:19.440
you need to type that will bring that positive nitrogen balance for a longer

1496
01:30:19.441 --> 01:30:23.640
period of time where whey protein isolates a,
the effect is about three hours.

1497
01:30:23.641 --> 01:30:28.260
The case in my sellers about seven hours.
Is that why people take um,
uh,

1498
01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:31.410
cottage cheese at nine too?
Cause it takes a long time to digest.

1499
01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:34.650
So it gives you a slow,
a slow burn protein.

1500
01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:39.630
And do you make athletes wake up to take protein or is that bullshit you meet in

1501
01:30:39.631 --> 01:30:40.850
the middle of the night?
I hear that

1502
01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:45.750
fanatical bodybuilders wake up in the middle of the night to do it.

1503
01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:49.170
An injection of growth hormone.
Jesus Christ.
I didn't mean that.

1504
01:30:49.171 --> 01:30:51.390
I meant did they get up in the middle of the night and drink a shake?

1505
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:54.570
I've heard like,
what's that chick's name that was in that movie,

1506
01:30:54.571 --> 01:30:58.170
million dollar baby.
She got all yoked Hilary swank.

1507
01:30:59.190 --> 01:31:01.020
I always thought she was hot.
A lot of people don't,

1508
01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:03.570
they think she's kind of manly.
I think you're fucking crazy.

1509
01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:07.590
So it's buckwild too,
man.
You know what I'm saying,
victor.
But anyway,

1510
01:31:07.591 --> 01:31:10.640
she got real yoked when she was in that movie and uh,

1511
01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.080
she said that she had to get up in the middle of the night and drink protein

1512
01:31:13.081 --> 01:31:16.750
shakes.
You know,
one of the other very important things that,
uh,

1513
01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:21.630
uh,
I think people overlook is hydration,
right?

1514
01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:26.000
I see a lot of guys MMA fighters that just,
uh,

1515
01:31:26.250 --> 01:31:29.190
are dehydrated and I just don't,
um,

1516
01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:32.460
they don't drink adequate fluids.
Uh,

1517
01:31:33.150 --> 01:31:35.070
I don't know if I should talk about a specific guy,

1518
01:31:35.071 --> 01:31:40.071
but there's a high level MMA guy that just was having all sorts of issues with

1519
01:31:40.351 --> 01:31:43.980
his training and performance and he was dried up like a prune.

1520
01:31:44.010 --> 01:31:48.270
Who is an Josh Thompson.
Really?
Wow.

1521
01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:52.890
Well he looks fucking tremendous.
And his last fight,
did you work with him?
Yes.

1522
01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:56.610
Well it makes sense cause he's like one of those Bressler dudes that would

1523
01:31:56.611 --> 01:32:00.010
probably overtrain a little bit and wine up and just kind of

1524
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:02.740
<v 1>suck it up and keep going.
But he,
he uh,</v>

1525
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:07.990
<v 2>apparently his wife helps him and,
and whatever time it is,
he goes to train,</v>

1526
01:32:07.991 --> 01:32:11.020
she gets up and takes the bottles of water and puts numbers on them.

1527
01:32:11.021 --> 01:32:15.460
And by the time she gets home,
he better have been sixth one before it goes on.

1528
01:32:15.461 --> 01:32:19.120
But he's drinking about 10,
16 ounce bottles of water a day,

1529
01:32:19.130 --> 01:32:20.440
an hour before he just,

1530
01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:23.530
whenever he was thirsty or it didn't even really think about it.

1531
01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:27.100
And through the testing we were able to determine that he was just very

1532
01:32:27.101 --> 01:32:32.101
dehydrated and that just that one simple piece of information and change

1533
01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:33.940
according to,
you know,

1534
01:32:33.970 --> 01:32:37.900
Javier Mendez is coach made a huge difference and in his training and

1535
01:32:37.901 --> 01:32:38.734
performance.

1536
01:32:38.890 --> 01:32:39.071
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1537
01:32:39.071 --> 01:32:43.540
I found out that I was dehydrated once by taking one of those a body fat test

1538
01:32:43.541 --> 01:32:46.630
where you stand on something where it,
it registered.

1539
01:32:46.631 --> 01:32:51.631
I'd taken one recently and it registered me like three or 4% higher body fat

1540
01:32:51.731 --> 01:32:54.850
that I knew I was and I was like,
that's crazy.
I go,
that seems weird.

1541
01:32:54.851 --> 01:32:57.070
Is it like not that accurate?
And he's like,

1542
01:32:57.100 --> 01:33:00.820
the only time it's inaccurate is if you're dehydrated.
And I was like,
oh,

1543
01:33:00.821 --> 01:33:04.930
I'm dehydrated.
And so I started drinking water again.
I drank water,

1544
01:33:04.931 --> 01:33:08.230
took it again and my body fat was 4% lower.

1545
01:33:08.710 --> 01:33:13.270
It was like it was reads an electrical frequency through your body and when

1546
01:33:13.271 --> 01:33:18.040
there's no water in your body,
it's not firing as good.
It's more resistance.

1547
01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:22.330
And so your whole body operates with more resistance.
It has less,

1548
01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:26.470
less energy.
It had literally has a less electricity pulsing through it.

1549
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:31.570
That's one of the things that I have these MMA fighters.

1550
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:36.820
<v 2>Boxers do.
A lot of times they have to cut obviously to make weight.</v>

1551
01:33:37.670 --> 01:33:41.320
Um,
there's a number of things involved there,

1552
01:33:41.321 --> 01:33:46.321
but when it comes time after the way in to to replay hyper hydrate,

1553
01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:51.960
I have him take Celtic Sea salt and a quarter teaspoon and 16 ounces of water

1554
01:33:53.950 --> 01:33:58.950
and a a drink at least two before they shift over to a Cytomax or pedialyte or

1555
01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.440
some other form of electric light replacement.
Who's teaspoons of the salts?

1556
01:34:03.450 --> 01:34:05.830
They'll quarter,
quarter to quarter teaspoon,

1557
01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:10.510
which would have about five,
600 milligrams of sodium.

1558
01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:14.400
<v 1>So all in all a half a teaspoon in two glasses of water.
That's right.</v>

1559
01:34:14.630 --> 01:34:16.530
It would be the first thing after the way in.

1560
01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:18.150
That was one of the things that Dave Asprey,

1561
01:34:18.151 --> 01:34:21.660
it said that he does every morning so that people are missing out on that.
And,

1562
01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:23.160
and the reason

1563
01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:25.180
<v 2>a lot of people don't realize this,</v>

1564
01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:30.360
but seawater has almost the identical concentration of minerals and trace

1565
01:34:32.021 --> 01:34:36.430
elements as the fluid portion in your blood called serum or plasma.

1566
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.000
So by far the highest concentration of any men roller element is sodium at about

1567
01:34:43.091 --> 01:34:44.500
3000 parts per million.

1568
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:48.610
But you also have calcium at about a hundred parts.

1569
01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.370
Potassium and phosphorus are about 150 parts.

1570
01:34:51.730 --> 01:34:54.460
These other trace elements are very important.

1571
01:34:54.730 --> 01:34:57.950
So when it comes time to replete,
come back up,

1572
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:02.150
<v 3>you want to have the exact same ratio of all these minerals and trace elements</v>

1573
01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:06.320
in your system first.
And of course the sodium is what causes the retention.

1574
01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:10.940
Where I've got guys,
you know,
do this before they fight as well cause you,
you'll,

1575
01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:13.730
you'll retain throughout the course of a fight.
The uh,

1576
01:35:14.210 --> 01:35:17.840
the amount of fluid that you retained is much greater if you sodium load.

1577
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:19.123
What a tricky,

1578
01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:23.480
tricky fucking thing it is that everybody is like 90 plus whatever it is,

1579
01:35:23.481 --> 01:35:26.900
percent water,
whatever.
What percentage is it?
Probably 70.

1580
01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:31.970
We live next to the ocean and we can't even drink that shit that fucked up.

1581
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.150
You can't even drink it.
It's like that's on in nature's like,
you know what?

1582
01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:37.220
We've got to make it a way harder for you to get water.

1583
01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:38.960
If we let you guys drink all this water,

1584
01:35:38.961 --> 01:35:43.580
there'd be no ocean could drink all the water.
We just suck it right out.

1585
01:35:43.610 --> 01:35:44.720
And then secondly,

1586
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:48.650
what a lot of people don't realize is that your skin is the,

1587
01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:51.020
is the largest organ in your body.

1588
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:56.590
So I have guys take a bath after the weigh in but not hot bath cause it's

1589
01:35:57.501 --> 01:35:58.940
thermogenic.
It would go out,

1590
01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:04.040
they do that to cut but room temperature bass for 10 minutes and their,

1591
01:36:04.041 --> 01:36:04.980
their water,
their,

1592
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.000
their systems soaks water like a sponge and Epsom salts is an excellent source

1593
01:36:10.341 --> 01:36:15.020
of magnesium.
You absorb magnesium through your skin through Epsom salt baths.

1594
01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:17.090
That's why people have always,
you know like people say,

1595
01:36:17.091 --> 01:36:19.720
oh you take an Epsom salt bath.
Like what the fuck is that going to do for you?

1596
01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:21.320
It sounds like stupid.

1597
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:25.410
But then you realize that your skin actually absorbs the magnesium from that
APP.

1598
01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:30.710
Very important for muscle relaxation.
You know,
people that drink Epson salt.
Yeah.

1599
01:36:30.711 --> 01:36:35.180
That's only to just still below it out.
You got a problem,
man,

1600
01:36:35.210 --> 01:36:38.030
that will blow it out.
Your system just goes released.

1601
01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:42.860
That's how the girls in la stay fat.
Yeah.
You'll find pieces of your furniture,

1602
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:47.360
you know,
you ate
flying out of your ass into the toilet.

1603
01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:49.011
You'd be surprised.

1604
01:36:49.011 --> 01:36:52.400
These basic things we're talking about that the guys at the very top,

1605
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:57.110
just like Josh as an example,
you never let mean,
he's just train hard,

1606
01:36:57.750 --> 01:37:00.690
train like crazy.
And I said,
listen,
you know,

1607
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:03.260
we found something here that could be very important.

1608
01:37:03.261 --> 01:37:06.050
His last fight with Gilbert Melendez,
he looks sensational.

1609
01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:10.100
If you can attribute that to you,
uh,
figuring out that he was a dehydrated,

1610
01:37:10.101 --> 01:37:13.210
that's amazing because that was the,
you know,
I know,
uh,

1611
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:15.800
that they've had fights before and,
and Gills,

1612
01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:18.320
a fucking super tough guy and that was the best.
Josh.

1613
01:37:18.330 --> 01:37:22.010
It never looked against him.
He looks sensational.
Just a great fight.

1614
01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:25.250
It was one of those fights where you're kind of sad that anybody,
one,
you know,

1615
01:37:25.251 --> 01:37:29.780
it's like that was such a,
it was such a close fight.
I'm certainly not a judge,

1616
01:37:29.781 --> 01:37:33.970
but I thought Josh did Goodwin.
I thought he could've won easily.
Uh,
it could,

1617
01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:38.810
I mean he had a lot of sweet takedowns to where he was a sort of choke slamming

1618
01:37:38.811 --> 01:37:42.470
them,
you know,
tripping them and you know,
it was just,
he just looked great.

1619
01:37:42.650 --> 01:37:45.530
He had great endurance,
fought well on his feet and it's just great.

1620
01:37:45.531 --> 01:37:48.190
Fight Melendez is fucking awesome.
I love watching snack.

1621
01:37:48.191 --> 01:37:51.440
I imagine the effect if we're talking about the red blood cells or are

1622
01:37:51.441 --> 01:37:56.070
delivering oxygen and removing these metabolic

1623
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:59.670
<v 2>waste byproducts with every breath.
Well,
if you're well hydrated,</v>

1624
01:37:59.671 --> 01:38:03.310
it's like having an eight lane freeway and all of a sudden you get dehydrated

1625
01:38:03.311 --> 01:38:05.610
and now you get a three lane freeway.
How many bots?

1626
01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:09.420
A lot more difficult to deliver and pick up and remove when you're not well

1627
01:38:09.421 --> 01:38:13.840
hydrated.
So the sodium and carbohydrate and other things that can help,
you know,

1628
01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:17.190
you will sweat less,
you will retain,
uh,
the fluids.

1629
01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:21.330
It will tremendously improve your stamina and endurance.
Sodium,

1630
01:38:21.810 --> 01:38:23.370
sodium,
and carbs.

1631
01:38:23.470 --> 01:38:27.730
<v 1>People have always told you all your life.
Keep away from salt.
Sodium is bad.</v>

1632
01:38:27.731 --> 01:38:30.340
So do you,
makes you retain water and get fat and have heart attacks.

1633
01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:35.440
Isn't that funny?
Victor Conti and Dave Aspery are telling you to put sea salt.

1634
01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:40.060
Dave went as far as Himalayan sea salt because he's that kind of pimp,
you know.

1635
01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.080
Well,
and they're not all the same.
So He's right.

1636
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:45.910
There are some sea salt that doesn't have these other minerals and trace

1637
01:38:45.911 --> 01:38:49.780
elements that I'm talking about.
I've,
I've had athletes by the wrong type.
Oh,

1638
01:38:49.810 --> 01:38:52.360
well he says you should get that stuff too because there's less pollution.

1639
01:38:52.361 --> 01:38:56.080
It's impure.
Um,
now when you see like top,

1640
01:38:56.081 --> 01:38:59.290
do you do monitor top training camp?
So you see like,
like the,

1641
01:38:59.291 --> 01:39:02.200
the Diaz brothers and Cesar Gracie's and you see those guys?

1642
01:39:02.350 --> 01:39:06.640
Do you try to figure out,
okay,
who's working smart?
Who's,
who's using,
you know,

1643
01:39:06.641 --> 01:39:09.560
the,
the proper blood testing and finding out what their,
you know,

1644
01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:12.700
nutritional requirements are and who's just going old school,

1645
01:39:12.710 --> 01:39:16.420
rocky drinking eggs in the morning and running hills.
Usually I just come to me,

1646
01:39:16.421 --> 01:39:18.540
I don't,
you know,
I'm not a hired gun.

1647
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:20.890
I don't go out to different camps or different fighters.

1648
01:39:20.891 --> 01:39:22.060
You don't pay attention to it at all?

1649
01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:22.681
<v 2>Well I do,</v>

1650
01:39:22.681 --> 01:39:27.600
but a lot of people come to me and want me to go to Mexico or come to Los

1651
01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:30.610
Angeles.
I'm 62 Kinda semiretired.

1652
01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:34.770
I'm right down the street from undisputed boxing gym where we're not Ito trains

1653
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:38.430
there in San Carlos,
about four miles from my house.
Um,

1654
01:39:38.431 --> 01:39:43.020
so athletes that want to come to where I am,
that's where Josh comes.

1655
01:39:43.021 --> 01:39:46.110
That's where Kyle comes.
Um,
then I work with them.
So,

1656
01:39:46.111 --> 01:39:50.820
so I'm just really not out there pursuing opportunities.
I,
if it's fun,

1657
01:39:50.850 --> 01:39:55.560
like I said,
that's my mantra.
If it's not fun,
I don't do it.
Uh,
then,
then,

1658
01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:57.930
and the chemistry's right then,
then I help people.

1659
01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.850
But I certainly don't do it for the money.
It's,

1660
01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:03.480
it's a really about just enjoying being in the trenches with athletes.

1661
01:40:03.850 --> 01:40:04.121
<v 1>Now,</v>

1662
01:40:04.121 --> 01:40:09.121
this a Veda testing stands for the voluntary anti doping association.

1663
01:40:09.221 --> 01:40:11.450
Is that what it is now?
This is a,

1664
01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:15.490
for people that want to go above and beyond the requirements of athletic

1665
01:40:15.491 --> 01:40:17.950
commissions.
That's for people that are saying,
okay,

1666
01:40:17.951 --> 01:40:22.060
I'm going to show the world that regardless of whether or not you think that the

1667
01:40:22.210 --> 01:40:24.760
flooded commissions,
urine tests are flimsy,

1668
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.990
we're going to take some like voluntary tests that are much more stringent.

1669
01:40:28.991 --> 01:40:33.280
We're going to find exogenous testosterone.

1670
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:37.980
<v 2>What's the word here is voluntary.
Yes.
So some people,</v>

1671
01:40:37.981 --> 01:40:41.700
there's this whole deal with the quote Olympic style testing,

1672
01:40:41.701 --> 01:40:45.030
which I is not really what it is,
but God started with Floyd Mayweather.

1673
01:40:45.810 --> 01:40:50.280
He was the one that was demanding with Shane Mosley and Victor Ortiz and these

1674
01:40:50.281 --> 01:40:53.260
other guys that he's fought,
that everybody that fights him,
you know,

1675
01:40:53.261 --> 01:40:55.930
if you want to fight the best,
you've got to take the test,
right.

1676
01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:58.270
Mantra that that.
Um,

1677
01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.680
but that's really not Olympic style testing that we're doesn't apply at all.

1678
01:41:02.681 --> 01:41:07.681
To me because at the core of that definition is 24 seven three 65 and as I said

1679
01:41:08.111 --> 01:41:10.840
earlier,
if he's doing this eight weeks out from a fight,

1680
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:13.960
of course if you're hungry,
a half loaf of bread is better than none,

1681
01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:17.560
but what was he doing six and nine months before as we talked about,

1682
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:20.740
so you could load up like crazy for months and months,

1683
01:41:20.741 --> 01:41:24.850
still retain some of the benefits of then show up and retain a lot of the

1684
01:41:24.851 --> 01:41:27.640
benefits and then show up at a fight and say,
okay,

1685
01:41:27.641 --> 01:41:30.730
you're the guy when you're ready to go into the testing and then drag him into

1686
01:41:30.731 --> 01:41:31.660
it the following day.

1687
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:34.450
<v 1>Is it a case of where there's smoke?
There's fire,</v>

1688
01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:37.930
I mean with all these like many pack yet there's a perfect sample.

1689
01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:41.710
Manny Pacquiao was,
he's gone through eight different weight classes.

1690
01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:45.160
Manny Pacquiao started off what was the a hundred and what?

1691
01:41:45.161 --> 01:41:48.730
606 pounds all the way up to,
what was he fighting?

1692
01:41:48.731 --> 01:41:51.600
You know when you fought Margarito how big was Margaret Margaret?

1693
01:41:51.601 --> 01:41:55.240
I was like one 68 in an hour,
but in there he was like one 68.
I mean,

1694
01:41:55.241 --> 01:42:00.180
that's incredible.
To go from one oh six to fighting a big guy like Margarita.
Um,

1695
01:42:00.220 --> 01:42:03.940
you know,
a lot of people have accused him of stuff.
Do you know anything?

1696
01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:08.290
<v 2>I'm highly suspicious.
I've said this publicly.
I mean,</v>

1697
01:42:08.330 --> 01:42:13.300
there's no doubt in my mind that when you're not subjected to testing and uh,

1698
01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:17.500
you know,
I do,
I think it's been going on for a very long time,
including,

1699
01:42:17.890 --> 01:42:20.500
you know,
back in the Philippines.
That's my opinion is yes,

1700
01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:24.580
I believe that he's been doing stuff.
So it,
it's a,

1701
01:42:24.670 --> 01:42:29.350
but I want to go back for just a minute to what you were asking about Vata and,

1702
01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:32.920
and the vault aspects being voluntary.

1703
01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:37.440
And this is what no Nieto is doing now is he just stepped up and,

1704
01:42:37.441 --> 01:42:41.290
and this is the great thing that's different than you saw the or commission

1705
01:42:41.291 --> 01:42:44.050
testing is that both fighters,
you know,

1706
01:42:44.090 --> 01:42:47.200
or wherever they're fighting or going to be subjected to the same testing or

1707
01:42:47.201 --> 01:42:47.711
these guys,

1708
01:42:47.711 --> 01:42:52.540
now we want a contract and we're both gonna do this testing and here she was

1709
01:42:52.541 --> 01:42:55.420
going to do it.
It's going to be bothered.
It's going to be you solder,
whatever.

1710
01:42:56.290 --> 01:43:00.910
Uh,
no needs,
needs have just entered a 24,
seven,
three 65.

1711
01:43:00.970 --> 01:43:03.280
He's in the pool just like an Olympic athlete.

1712
01:43:03.490 --> 01:43:08.260
And whenever they come and he's able to do this on an individual basis.

1713
01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:12.010
So if his opponent wants to do it,
great.
If he doesn't want to do it,

1714
01:43:12.011 --> 01:43:15.100
he offered it to the guy from Japan that he fought the other night.

1715
01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:19.450
I didn't have an interest.
Okay,
well it didn't have an interest,

1716
01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:22.060
but no neato wants to show his fans and,

1717
01:43:22.061 --> 01:43:26.350
and lead by example and show his sport that he's the real deal.

1718
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:28.700
That he has nothing to hide and everything to prove.

1719
01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:32.510
<v 1>Yes it is.
Yeah.
You have something to do with Vida,</v>

1720
01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:37.180
<v 2>you know,
I provide consultation Nevada and people talk about that.</v>

1721
01:43:37.181 --> 01:43:39.220
Is there a conflict of interest and so on.

1722
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:44.530
I became an antidoping advocate in 2005 that's when you went to jail?

1723
01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:46.870
No,
I,
yeah,
that is when I went to jail.
That's good.

1724
01:43:46.871 --> 01:43:48.220
But that's a good reason to become.

1725
01:43:48.450 --> 01:43:51.380
Like obviously this show was actually the about was actually before I went to

1726
01:43:51.381 --> 01:43:55.130
jail.
I met twice with Usada.
Uh,

1727
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:59.960
and it wasn't to give information on,
on anybody.
I didn't rat on anybody.

1728
01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:01.760
I didn't talk about specific athletes.

1729
01:44:01.761 --> 01:44:05.570
It was just to talk to them about methods that I use to circumvent the testing

1730
01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:07.220
and where are these loopholes were.

1731
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:12.310
So like a hacker could give a company advice on how to keep their system from

1732
01:44:12.441 --> 01:44:15.410
getting hacked exactly what I did.
And so I helped them.

1733
01:44:15.411 --> 01:44:18.860
I had three different meetings with them and went over thousands of pages of

1734
01:44:18.861 --> 01:44:22.070
documents and,
and it wasn't an exchange for leniency.

1735
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:24.720
I got nothing out of it other than me trying to,

1736
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:28.850
to make a contribution to the collective effort.
Thereafter,

1737
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:33.140
I helped a Dwayne chambers are,
or that I worked with,
uh,
uh,

1738
01:44:33.141 --> 01:44:34.100
from the UK.

1739
01:44:34.130 --> 01:44:39.130
And he asked me to write a paper that listed every single drug that I gave him,

1740
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:44.930
the purpose,
the frequency of the dosage of the brand,
uh,
which I did.

1741
01:44:45.170 --> 01:44:50.170
And so he submitted that to the UK anti-doping and then some people from BBC,

1742
01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:54.650
you know,
asked me for my prescription,
how would you clean this up?

1743
01:44:54.651 --> 01:44:57.040
And so I wrote a paper about,
you know,

1744
01:44:57.050 --> 01:44:59.960
how the testing could be set up in a way that would be much more effective.

1745
01:44:59.961 --> 01:45:04.690
And that got submitted to,
uh,
to water.
And eventually they reached out to me and,

1746
01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:08.660
and flew me to New York.
And I met with the chairman at that time,
Dick Pound,

1747
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:12.890
and spent a lot of time with him and on him.
He liked that pain,

1748
01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:18.830
dig pound the account.
Uh,
and so anyway,
so,

1749
01:45:18.831 --> 01:45:22.610
so I provided consultation with them and I've worked on them with several

1750
01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:23.900
different projects.

1751
01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:27.950
And so Martin or Goodman from Vada reached out to me and yes,

1752
01:45:27.951 --> 01:45:32.720
I provided consultation to her and there are been formerly of the Nevada State

1753
01:45:32.721 --> 01:45:33.620
Athletic Commission.
Yes.

1754
01:45:33.650 --> 01:45:37.580
She was the chairman of the medical advisory board for nine years.

1755
01:45:37.581 --> 01:45:42.260
And her significant other who's also the vice president of Awda is skip is flip

1756
01:45:42.261 --> 01:45:46.260
Hemanth ski.
Who was the chairman of that same uh,

1757
01:45:46.261 --> 01:45:49.280
Nevada medical advisory board for her for a decade before that.

1758
01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:52.970
He's actually the guy that implemented the very first anabolic steroid testing

1759
01:45:52.971 --> 01:45:53.804
in the state of Nevada.

1760
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:58.870
Now how is the distinction made between what is legal and what is illegal Zma

1761
01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:04.310
even though it's effective and it makes your body produce more testosterone and

1762
01:46:04.311 --> 01:46:06.110
growth hormone and all this good stuff.
That's it.

1763
01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:10.790
Legal things have a committee and it's,
you know,

1764
01:46:10.850 --> 01:46:14.810
they have a strong pivoted substances list.
But is it based on efficacy?

1765
01:46:14.811 --> 01:46:18.280
Because if that's the case wizened Zma where you're saying anything that works

1766
01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:23.330
is performance enhancing.
So where do you draw that line?
Very good question.

1767
01:46:23.630 --> 01:46:28.630
And I'll tell you the interesting aspect and drastic difference between state

1768
01:46:29.601 --> 01:46:32.480
commissions and water.

1769
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:35.870
And you saw [inaudible] and Vata or anybody that follows the the world

1770
01:46:35.871 --> 01:46:40.871
anti-doping code is the way their system works is everything is illegal unless

1771
01:46:41.241 --> 01:46:45.620
you,
you,
uh,
get permission from us.
So any drug,

1772
01:46:45.770 --> 01:46:47.780
I mean the,
the whatever it is.

1773
01:46:47.781 --> 01:46:50.500
So if you go to them when you say you need testosterone

1774
01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:52.860
<v 3>and you submit your medical records and you get one,</v>

1775
01:46:53.010 --> 01:46:57.700
but that's even actually more restrictive,
if that makes sense.
So unless,

1776
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:59.580
you know,
you just have to make a declaration,

1777
01:46:59.581 --> 01:47:03.090
you have to tell us what you're taking in advance and if we don't like what it

1778
01:47:03.091 --> 01:47:04.410
is,
then we'll let you know.

1779
01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:08.340
Do you feel like testosterone replacement shouldn't be a part of any sport?

1780
01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:09.600
Do you feel like it's,

1781
01:47:09.601 --> 01:47:14.601
it's just might as well be cheating or it's just too easy to manipulate or it's

1782
01:47:14.671 --> 01:47:16.530
very easy to manipulate?
I,

1783
01:47:16.531 --> 01:47:19.860
I've talked about this as an example with baseball players when they had a

1784
01:47:19.861 --> 01:47:22.470
couple of positive tests for synthetic testosterone recently,

1785
01:47:22.471 --> 01:47:26.100
actually three of them.
And there's been seven or eight in the last six months.

1786
01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:29.820
<v 5>Um,
these fast acting creams and gels,</v>

1787
01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:33.780
they can play a game 10 o'clock.
They rub this cream on after the game,

1788
01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:38.120
it peaks it about four hours.
And the system aiding with recovery and,

1789
01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:42.320
and tissue repair by eight hours,
they're back down to baseline.
But,

1790
01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:45.360
but six hours later,
they're below the four to one t ratio.

1791
01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:50.660
So they can use it every single day to enhance recovery after games and they

1792
01:47:50.791 --> 01:47:51.870
will never test positive.

1793
01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:56.490
<v 3>Wow.
And how long does this stay inside your system for?
Like Beta test?</v>

1794
01:47:57.050 --> 01:47:59.900
<v 5>What I,
what I recommend.
And in fact,</v>

1795
01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:04.790
before Ryan Braun,
the MVP who tested positive,

1796
01:48:04.850 --> 01:48:09.170
that was the home run guy.
Uh,
and in fact,
he's up this year,

1797
01:48:09.171 --> 01:48:10.400
I think for the same title,

1798
01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:14.660
but I said back then when they got ready to introduce growth hormone,

1799
01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:19.550
that was a huge mistake and it was a waste of money.
Growth Hormone,

1800
01:48:19.551 --> 01:48:20.450
in my opinion.

1801
01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:26.080
And according to the researchers at Stanford does not enhance performance.

1802
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:29.690
Will it help you burn body fat?
Yes.

1803
01:48:29.691 --> 01:48:32.570
Will it help you make your muscles bigger?
Yes.

1804
01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:35.360
Will it help accelerate the healing and tissue repair?

1805
01:48:35.361 --> 01:48:38.480
Connective Tissue Ligament Tendon type type injury?
Yes.

1806
01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:42.290
Does it make your muscles stronger and faster?
The answer's no,

1807
01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:47.340
<v 3>but it helps you heal.
So if you're recovering,
it helps you recover quicker from,</v>

1808
01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:49.980
you know,
you can work out harder.
So it doesn't hence,

1809
01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:52.950
well the studies that they've done,

1810
01:48:52.951 --> 01:48:56.330
there's no science showing that it makes you stronger or faster.
Right.

1811
01:48:56.340 --> 01:49:00.120
But isn't that sort of illogical?
We listened to what we just said.

1812
01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:04.740
I understand it.
So like I said,
it burns body fat,
makes the muscles bigger,

1813
01:49:04.770 --> 01:49:08.630
makes the tissue,
doesn't make you stronger or faster.
Right.

1814
01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.660
Bottom line is if it's for cosmetics and you're a bodybuilder,
no,
no,
no.

1815
01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:16.710
You said it makes tissue recover faster and that is the point of working out

1816
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:19.260
your workout.
Your tissue breaks down,

1817
01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:24.270
it gets stronger and it heals quicker if you're on growth hormone.
That alone.

1818
01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:27.150
So you're saying in recovery and benefit means you can train and get a deeper

1819
01:49:27.151 --> 01:49:30.030
training load.
Yeah.
It allows you to train harder.

1820
01:49:30.031 --> 01:49:32.100
It allows you to recover faster than normal,

1821
01:49:32.101 --> 01:49:34.260
which is a big part of what training is all about.

1822
01:49:34.261 --> 01:49:37.380
Training is not just training and you get stronger.
The harder you work,

1823
01:49:37.381 --> 01:49:39.360
you get stronger,
you know,
you have to recover.

1824
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:42.750
And if you're recovering in an unnatural rate because you're taking growth

1825
01:49:42.751 --> 01:49:46.020
hormone,
then guess what?
Growth Hormone is allowing you to get stronger.

1826
01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:47.280
Here's the argument.

1827
01:49:47.410 --> 01:49:51.090
I don't think you can compare testosterone to growth hormone.

1828
01:49:52.330 --> 01:49:52.650
Correct.

1829
01:49:52.650 --> 01:49:57.510
<v 5>Anabolic testosterone is classified as an anti catabolic agent.</v>

1830
01:49:57.630 --> 01:49:59.520
It's not even classified as being anabolic.

1831
01:49:59.550 --> 01:50:03.330
<v 3>All I'm saying is that you can't say,
I mean whatever their study says,</v>

1832
01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:06.480
it doesn't make you stronger.
That's silly.
That's a silly study.

1833
01:50:06.690 --> 01:50:09.060
It allows you to train harder.
Let me back up.

1834
01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:14.240
It was a review of every single study ever performed and not a single one of

1835
01:50:14.641 --> 01:50:16.590
them showed that it did make you stronger,
faster.

1836
01:50:16.930 --> 01:50:18.570
So why do all the review article,

1837
01:50:18.810 --> 01:50:23.550
but all these athletes take it and they all claim that it makes them stronger.

1838
01:50:23.610 --> 01:50:25.470
It helps.
You want to know why?
Yes,

1839
01:50:26.210 --> 01:50:30.740
<v 5>because they stack it with steroids and the steroids help you create the protein</v>

1840
01:50:30.741 --> 01:50:32.240
synthesis.
It's a leap frog.

1841
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:37.070
You make the gains and then it helps you with the retention of those gains.

1842
01:50:37.210 --> 01:50:41.320
<v 3>So the growth hormone and the steroids together are effective.</v>

1843
01:50:41.321 --> 01:50:44.230
The growth hormone by itself does not make you stronger.

1844
01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:48.730
Candy flats it their candy in like a motherfucker,
Brian.
Wow.

1845
01:50:48.731 --> 01:50:53.000
And how did all this information get mainstream mean?

1846
01:50:53.001 --> 01:50:55.020
Was it Soviet scientists?
Like who,

1847
01:50:55.050 --> 01:50:59.230
who was the first person to figure out how to manipulate hormones and add

1848
01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:02.760
different things and you know,
okay,
we'll,
we'll,
we'll talk about that

1849
01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:07.240
<v 5>Diana Ball,
the first American steroid in a minute,
which they,
this guy's Ziglar,</v>

1850
01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:10.390
a weightlifting coach for the United States in the 50s.
Got It.

1851
01:51:10.391 --> 01:51:13.060
From the Soviet block.
You knew they were doing stuff,

1852
01:51:13.090 --> 01:51:16.750
but I want to go back to this other point about testosterone.

1853
01:51:16.830 --> 01:51:20.970
<v 3>Okay,
please do.
Um,
now I forgot what I was saying.
How dare you,</v>

1854
01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:24.270
you want them to go back but you don't know where the fuck you going.
Well,

1855
01:51:24.271 --> 01:51:29.040
what we were talking about was introducing artificial testosterone and whether

1856
01:51:29.041 --> 01:51:29.874
or not artificial,

1857
01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:34.720
<v 5>okay.
It was about baseball and Ryan Braun and,
and the specific test.</v>

1858
01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:39.070
And I got a call from,
from the editor,
Terry Thompson,

1859
01:51:39.071 --> 01:51:41.590
a of the New York Daily News Sports Department.

1860
01:51:41.591 --> 01:51:45.610
And she was asking for my comment about that they are going to do this growth

1861
01:51:45.611 --> 01:51:49.620
hormone test and baseball and introduce it,
the minor leagues.
I said there,

1862
01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:54.720
it's not the highest and best priority for the funds that are available to do

1863
01:51:54.941 --> 01:51:57.910
testing.
They need to introduce this cir,

1864
01:51:57.911 --> 01:52:02.911
this carbon isotope ratio testing because that has a significant effect upon

1865
01:52:03.401 --> 01:52:07.060
performance and the players are doing it on a daily basis and they're coming

1866
01:52:07.061 --> 01:52:11.020
back under the four to one and it's a huge you loophole and they should,

1867
01:52:11.021 --> 01:52:15.250
instead of doing this with growth hormone,
which is an anti catabolic agent,

1868
01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:20.580
you could eliminate the use of the anabolic agent testosterone with those exact

1869
01:52:21.161 --> 01:52:23.320
same dollars.
They both cost about $400.

1870
01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:31.170
<v 3>Okay.
All of this was,
again,
this is some of his legal,</v>

1871
01:52:31.230 --> 01:52:34.980
some of it's illegal growth hormone across the board as illegal.
Correct.

1872
01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:38.350
Everyone says it's illegal.
Now there's a lot of people that,

1873
01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:43.800
<v 5>a lot of other factors I'm in,
doctors are prescribing it.
It's off label use.
Uh,</v>

1874
01:52:44.250 --> 01:52:45.790
uh,
you know,
that's,

1875
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:47.720
<v 2>I don't know about the legality of it.</v>

1876
01:52:47.721 --> 01:52:52.100
But then you know places like Florida and Arizona and Nevada,

1877
01:52:52.101 --> 01:52:55.730
there's a lot of these clinics that are for anti aging longevity purposes.

1878
01:52:55.731 --> 01:52:56.564
I'm sure they're there.

1879
01:52:57.670 --> 01:53:01.060
<v 1>Yeah,
no,
that's not what I mean.
I mean for sports,
I mean like for MMA,</v>

1880
01:53:01.061 --> 01:53:05.110
no one's legal team to have testosterone or to have human growth hormone.

1881
01:53:05.230 --> 01:53:08.050
I've never heard of human growth hormone exemption because they can't test for

1882
01:53:08.051 --> 01:53:08.884
it.
Correct.

1883
01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:11.900
<v 2>I don't believe they have an effective test for it.</v>

1884
01:53:11.901 --> 01:53:15.080
They've actually got two tests for it and they use both of them at the regional

1885
01:53:15.081 --> 01:53:18.890
Olympic Games,
but they don't last very long at the most.

1886
01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:22.850
After an injection they can possibly detect it maybe up to 36 hours.

1887
01:53:24.130 --> 01:53:26.950
<v 1>What is the,
what's the future when it comes to this stuff?</v>

1888
01:53:26.951 --> 01:53:30.440
Because it makes me think that if you're sticking pellets and your ass and

1889
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:33.400
butterflying them in there and all the different stuff,

1890
01:53:33.401 --> 01:53:37.330
the creams and all this different jazz,
when owl,
how far away,

1891
01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:40.840
how far are we from real genetic manipulation?

1892
01:53:41.170 --> 01:53:45.980
How far are we from something that changes human beings on,
you know,
on the,
the,

1893
01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.460
the level of the information.
That's inside their cells.

1894
01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:53.360
<v 2>I don't think it's all that that close really talking about when,
when is it?</v>

1895
01:53:53.361 --> 01:53:56.870
Is it going to be at the Athens Olympics?
Is it going to be in Beijing?

1896
01:53:56.871 --> 01:54:00.680
Is it going to be in London?
I'm an I still don't see gene doping.

1897
01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:05.420
Do you think that it's possible?
Yeah,
it seems inevitable.
That's my question.

1898
01:54:05.421 --> 01:54:06.070
You're saying,

1899
01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:10.100
you know it's possible I might not see in a week or a month or a couple of,

1900
01:54:10.101 --> 01:54:14.270
it's prohibited and they're attempting to develop a test for it and they're

1901
01:54:14.271 --> 01:54:17.780
working in conjunction with these companies that are manufacturing these

1902
01:54:17.781 --> 01:54:19.380
products and signed it happen.

1903
01:54:19.810 --> 01:54:22.270
<v 1>Isn't Monsanto involved in genetics now?</v>

1904
01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:28.450
I believe Monsanto is involved that they did.
It was maybe that pharmaceuticals,

1905
01:54:28.451 --> 01:54:29.320
whatever the fuck it was,

1906
01:54:29.530 --> 01:54:34.530
he got to get a company like Monsanto involved in the whole sports doping,

1907
01:54:35.170 --> 01:54:37.450
performance enhancing.
They'll figure out some shit.

1908
01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:39.330
They'll figure out how genetically modified.

1909
01:54:39.650 --> 01:54:44.510
<v 2>I want to go back and clarify.
You know,
my position,
what I think about you,</v>

1910
01:54:44.810 --> 01:54:47.950
the use of testosterone and because of the,

1911
01:54:48.010 --> 01:54:52.930
you have the ability through this carbon isotope ratio testing to differentiate

1912
01:54:52.931 --> 01:54:57.910
between endogenous and exogenous testosterone,
regardless of the delivery system,

1913
01:54:58.210 --> 01:55:02.020
that it should be classified like all the rest of the anabolic steroids.

1914
01:55:02.021 --> 01:55:04.300
In other words,
it's not quantitative.

1915
01:55:04.301 --> 01:55:08.920
Well you can have up to four to one or you can have,
you know,
allowed so much,

1916
01:55:08.921 --> 01:55:13.600
but over that it either has to be,
it's qualitative.

1917
01:55:13.630 --> 01:55:16.860
You can either do it or you can't.
You're either pregnant or you're not.
This,

1918
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:19.690
as soon as you allow it on a,
on a quantitative basis,

1919
01:55:20.050 --> 01:55:23.380
you're going to have the abuse that we're seeing now.
I mean it's,
it's,

1920
01:55:23.710 --> 01:55:28.450
and where do you draw that line?
What is abuse and what's not?
I mean it's,

1921
01:55:28.451 --> 01:55:29.680
it's,
it's a mess.

1922
01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:35.800
<v 1>Yeah,
it is a,
it's an interesting philosophical debate.</v>

1923
01:55:36.070 --> 01:55:37.330
You know about what you know,

1924
01:55:37.570 --> 01:55:42.570
like I've heard guys say that they would take testosterone and they would take

1925
01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:47.040
<v 3>human growth hormone when they,
you know,
get to be 50 years old,</v>

1926
01:55:47.041 --> 01:55:50.280
but they will not take it while they're fighting because they don't want to ever

1927
01:55:50.281 --> 01:55:53.820
think.
The only reason why I got here is because I cheated because I had to take

1928
01:55:53.821 --> 01:55:54.181
something.

1929
01:55:54.181 --> 01:55:57.020
I couldn't just do it with my willpower and I couldn't just do that with,

1930
01:55:57.030 --> 01:56:01.620
with do it with my discipline.
And then you got guys who just,
you know,

1931
01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:04.530
rampage says he just started taking,
it never felt better.

1932
01:56:04.531 --> 01:56:08.190
I said it was like really down in the dumps.
It's really bothering him now.

1933
01:56:08.191 --> 01:56:12.060
He's taking in.
He's well,
it's recreational.
It does make you feel good.

1934
01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:16.170
I'm sure you probably know.
Well,
it's also,
it doesn't just make you feel good.

1935
01:56:16.171 --> 01:56:21.050
It actually makes your body performed bat of course.
So is that fair?
How,

1936
01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:25.500
what happens there?
I mean it's obviously legal.
They made it legal in Nevada.

1937
01:56:25.501 --> 01:56:28.770
They've,
uh,
in most,
you know,
in California,

1938
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:32.790
California even made medical marijuana legal.
So,
I mean you can,

1939
01:56:32.791 --> 01:56:36.800
you can have medical marijuana exemptions now.
So there it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,

1940
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:41.040
it's allowed.
So is that a mistake?
I don't think it's a mistake.

1941
01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:43.780
You know,
I have a lot of personal friends that,

1942
01:56:43.810 --> 01:56:45.780
that are on testosterone replacement therapy.

1943
01:56:45.781 --> 01:56:47.730
Are they professional athletes that the fighters?
No.

1944
01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:49.380
So that's where it gets weird,
right?

1945
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:55.030
I back in pre balco rate days from 1996 through to 2003 I was on TRT

1946
01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:03.930
and absolutely loved the effects.
Moderately.

1947
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:06.420
Yeah.
Well you weren't fighting.
The real question is,

1948
01:57:06.421 --> 01:57:10.440
should it be okay for guys to compete in a sport where you're,

1949
01:57:10.441 --> 01:57:13.110
your goal is to punch someone in the head and you're,

1950
01:57:13.111 --> 01:57:17.610
you can turn your body into a far more efficient killing machine when you're too

1951
01:57:17.611 --> 01:57:18.420
stuck on the sauce.

1952
01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:23.250
And there's absolutely no doubt about the effects and how the tremendous,

1953
01:57:23.610 --> 01:57:28.580
tremendous advantage that it gives you in terms of,
of power and speed.
It's huge.

1954
01:57:28.650 --> 01:57:31.920
Well,
that's why it's weird.
It's like,
it's like this is a different sport.

1955
01:57:31.921 --> 01:57:34.620
It's not a,
it's not as simple as,
you know,

1956
01:57:34.621 --> 01:57:36.470
you just want to look better or you want to know,
no,

1957
01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:40.170
you can hurt someone more and you could hurt someone in a situation where maybe

1958
01:57:40.171 --> 01:57:41.940
you couldn't hurt them.
You know,

1959
01:57:41.941 --> 01:57:45.750
like when Cyborg tested positive and everybody will said,
you know,

1960
01:57:45.850 --> 01:57:50.670
first of all they said Duh.
And then after they said,
Duh,
they said,
well,
you know,

1961
01:57:50.671 --> 01:57:53.700
think about like the beating that she gave Gina Carano.

1962
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:57.370
Would she have even been able to do that if she was natural,

1963
01:57:57.371 --> 01:58:01.350
if she wasn't just ridiculously freakish man,
like strong.

1964
01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:04.050
And she says it's the only time she ever did anything and who the fuck am I

1965
01:58:04.051 --> 01:58:08.580
guess?
But from what I've talked to,
we had a hormone doctor on the show.

1966
01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:10.680
He's got doctor Steve Graham and he said,

1967
01:58:10.681 --> 01:58:13.230
that's not even possible for a woman to look like that if she's not taking

1968
01:58:13.231 --> 01:58:16.920
testosterone.
I have a friend named Bill Romanowski who once said,

1969
01:58:17.670 --> 01:58:21.870
as soon as an athlete starts to use drugs,
they become a liar.
Yeah.

1970
01:58:22.380 --> 01:58:25.890
Especially in a sport like that and MMA and you're,
you know,
you're a woman,

1971
01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:26.761
you know,

1972
01:58:26.761 --> 01:58:30.360
no moment wants to admit she's got man juice inside of her flowing through our

1973
01:58:30.361 --> 01:58:34.770
veins for Cerner.
Look all manly.
I went to get some of this testosterone.

1974
01:58:34.830 --> 01:58:39.460
I saw it,
I saw the other day.
I think about how when he turned 35 years,

1975
01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:41.890
your body just starts losing it like crazy.

1976
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.890
I don't think I had any to begin with.
So now I'm like negative.

1977
01:58:44.891 --> 01:58:49.050
I think you're like a void.
Your girl,
the girl.
But the sip appeared,

1978
01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:51.130
but the symptoms,
the symptoms were like,
you know,

1979
01:58:51.131 --> 01:58:55.540
you're just like really tired and were also smoke cigarettes.

1980
01:58:56.110 --> 01:59:00.010
The research is that at 30 years of age

1981
01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:05.230
<v 2>you began to decline by about 1% per year.</v>

1982
01:59:05.530 --> 01:59:10.420
So by the time you're 45,
you might have a a 15% reduction.

1983
01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:15.730
And at this recent,
uh,
uh,
association of Ringside Physicians Meeting,

1984
01:59:15.731 --> 01:59:20.731
they presented some data and they said that of the men over 45,

1985
01:59:21.340 --> 01:59:26.340
that 8% had a medical need for testosterone replacement therapy.

1986
01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:30.760
So it's not like you hit 35 and it's over.
There's a very gradual

1987
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:31.520
<v 3>flying,
right.</v>

1988
01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:35.270
Well it's also what we talked about earlier that an ethical person when they

1989
01:59:35.271 --> 01:59:39.020
want to adjust your hormones,
the first thing I'm going to look at is your diet,

1990
01:59:39.021 --> 01:59:42.890
your exercise and your sleep patterns.
This mother fucker is a mess and you know,

1991
01:59:42.900 --> 01:59:46.720
he wants to stick pellets in his ass and just looking for ways to Helton is

1992
01:59:46.721 --> 01:59:51.440
asked why it's always really,
really tired.
So once in sweetie,

1993
01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:54.650
not that healthy and you know that you're smoking cigarettes.

1994
01:59:54.651 --> 01:59:57.780
And so one of the least tell him,
tell him about cigarettes.
Victor Year,

1995
01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:02.850
you're a math science.
Do you want one?
They're loaded with cabinet,

1996
02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:03.201
which,

1997
02:00:03.201 --> 02:00:08.201
which inhibits the absorption of zinc and zinc reduction lowers uh,

1998
02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:12.080
androgen receptors and increases estrogen receptors.

1999
02:00:12.290 --> 02:00:14.670
So keep smoking and you'll become more feminine.

2000
02:00:14.671 --> 02:00:18.670
And if you don't have zinc in your body,
you have smaller loads.
That's right.

2001
02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:23.620
Let's see.
Internal volume.
I must have reduced.
It must have a lot of,
he said,

2002
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:25.640
I think the way I said it sounded sexy though.

2003
02:00:26.030 --> 02:00:29.400
Smaller loads like semen reduction and hospital observed.

2004
02:00:29.490 --> 02:00:32.600
There's a famous study by Dr Ohm and he couldn't,

2005
02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:34.530
<v 2>he was trying to figure out why</v>

2006
02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:41.600
alcoholics develop feminine light characteristics and alcohol depletes zinc.

2007
02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:48.920
And over time he gets over time that reduces your testosterone,

2008
02:00:49.711 --> 02:00:54.711
that reduces the number and size of androgen receptors and then increases the

2009
02:00:54.991 --> 02:00:59.730
number of estrogen receptors.
So if you're an alcoholic,

2010
02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:04.540
<v 3>eat better load up on zinc.
I need to get some zinc,
zinc and water.
Yeah.</v>

2011
02:01:04.541 --> 02:01:07.270
What alcohol is also an Immuno suppressant,
right?

2012
02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:11.200
What does exactly does that do to your,
your system when you drink and zincs?

2013
02:01:11.201 --> 02:01:15.600
A very powerful,
uh,
immunostimulant you know,
every,
you know about zinc,

2014
02:01:15.790 --> 02:01:19.040
throat laws,
injures and sync is everywhere.
It's great when you're sitting there.

2015
02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:19.903
Very good.

2016
02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:24.970
<v 2>Anabolic of all,
uh,
uh,
minerals.
Really.
Absolutely.</v>

2017
02:01:24.971 --> 02:01:27.160
It's,
it's,
there's no question at first it was in,

2018
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:30.040
in many different diseased populations.

2019
02:01:30.041 --> 02:01:34.150
You never heard about the discovery of zinc deficiency?
I have,
yeah.

2020
02:01:34.270 --> 02:01:39.200
Andre [inaudible] in 1961 and in Iran.
And then I confirmed a study and,

2021
02:01:39.250 --> 02:01:42.940
and again,
in 63 and Egypt,
long story short,
they had a,

2022
02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:46.610
a group of a teenage male boys with,

2023
02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:49.780
with a dwarf dwarfism and hypogonadism.

2024
02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:54.230
And they found out that was a high percentage of clay in the Diet that was

2025
02:01:54.231 --> 02:01:56.030
inhibiting the absorption of zinc.

2026
02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:59.660
And they gave them 50 milligrams of zinc a day.
And in a period of one year,

2027
02:01:59.661 --> 02:02:04.280
they grew over a foot in height and the size of their sexual organs over
doubled.

2028
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:08.690
How much sinks that I take every day,
like 200 milligrams.

2029
02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:11.000
Like zinc makes you tick gross on.

2030
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:13.670
Is it safe to take zinc every day or is that something he's just went to

2031
02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:16.820
unlimited access?
Yeah,
I wouldn't take the,

2032
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:19.970
the upper limit they say is 40 milligrams.
Uh,

2033
02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.540
Zma contains 30 milligrams per serving.
Cma.
I wouldn't go,

2034
02:02:23.570 --> 02:02:27.050
I wouldn't go too crazy because then you lower copper and then he started having

2035
02:02:27.051 --> 02:02:29.300
connective tissue,
ligament,
tendon type issues.

2036
02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:35.070
<v 3>So,
uh,
how much a day,
how many grams?
30 30 milligrams,</v>

2037
02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:37.770
30 milligrams,
30 milligrams of a bio available.

2038
02:02:37.770 --> 02:02:39.210
<v 2>Well,
form,
they're not all the same.</v>

2039
02:02:39.211 --> 02:02:44.211
Don't go to a Walgreens or cvs and buy some cheap a forum.

2040
02:02:44.581 --> 02:02:49.260
The one you want to avoid is any sort of zinc gluconate or zinc oxide or zinc

2041
02:02:49.261 --> 02:02:53.430
sulfate.
The,
the absorption is very,
very low.
So you want the zinc,

2042
02:02:53.530 --> 02:02:57.120
Matthias [inaudible] or zinc citrate,

2043
02:02:57.150 --> 02:03:01.410
or there's other forms that a zinc,
a spar Tate,
um,

2044
02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:04.650
that are much more bioavailable.
Is there a certain brand,
and I said,

2045
02:03:04.651 --> 02:03:08.820
look for or that you recommend,
what's your brand?
Well,

2046
02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:11.760
you just branded CMA is,
is look on the label.

2047
02:03:11.761 --> 02:03:16.250
If it says Zma has a trademark of snack,
then you know,
it comes from,
from a,

2048
02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:19.350
it's the real deal that comes originally from me.
But it's,
do

2049
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:23.940
<v 3>you have your muscle farm?
Has It,
uh,
optimum has at twin lab?</v>

2050
02:03:23.941 --> 02:03:28.430
Has It,
uh,
almost every company out there has it.
Do you have a zero is,

2051
02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:31.410
have you given a big bulk?
Oh,
thumbs up.

2052
02:03:31.740 --> 02:03:35.580
Like Victor Conte a big smiling face.
It doesn't,
no,

2053
02:03:35.581 --> 02:03:40.260
it has the double bicep.
Newman Newman's own pizza sauce.

2054
02:03:40.350 --> 02:03:44.070
You know,
it wasn't Newman's own popcorn.
He's got his face.
He should go for that.

2055
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:48.810
You're online of
the [inaudible] approved,

2056
02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:53.790
um,
purchased.
Did you just get some damn look at you?
That's how,

2057
02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.520
that's how serious Brian is about as testosterone depletion.

2058
02:03:57.190 --> 02:04:01.020
That's the healthiest way to do it at zinc.
Well,
it,
you know,

2059
02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:04.210
you gotta look at the food sources there.

2060
02:04:04.211 --> 02:04:09.150
The reason I would recommend that you do it in supplements is by a 10 fold

2061
02:04:09.151 --> 02:04:13.650
factor.
The highest food source for zinc is oysters,

2062
02:04:14.130 --> 02:04:18.810
which is always people say,
hell yeah,
it's an aphrodisiac and all of this that,

2063
02:04:18.811 --> 02:04:23.070
so that's how a lot of people that don't,
some people do like oysters.

2064
02:04:23.070 --> 02:04:25.560
A lot of people do not.
How many oysters do you have to eat?

2065
02:04:25.561 --> 02:04:30.270
Two to run up to half a candidate.
I have,
I can't,
you know the little cams.

2066
02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:35.950
Jesus.
What the fuck?
Seton camp grass fed.
That's bullshit.
What do you get?

2067
02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:39.260
You're fresh.
You're going to go the bar.
You got to get it.
Yeah,

2068
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:40.830
because if you get them in a can,
man,

2069
02:04:40.831 --> 02:04:43.470
you're getting all the shit that's in a cam,
you know,

2070
02:04:43.471 --> 02:04:46.090
like sodium and other preservatives.
And do you,

2071
02:04:46.170 --> 02:04:49.670
I guess they don't have the same issues that sardines do,
but canned sardines.
I,

2072
02:04:49.770 --> 02:04:53.640
I,
uh,
I had my blood work done and it showed high levels of arsenic.

2073
02:04:53.670 --> 02:04:58.320
You were talking about a nutritionally dense foods earlier in the greens.

2074
02:04:58.710 --> 02:05:03.510
They're also loaded with cholesterol.
Take a supplement.
No oysters.

2075
02:05:03.540 --> 02:05:05.410
Oh,
I was like,
what the fuck are you doing?

2076
02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:10.080
Is a lot of restaurant chains as Christ oysters,
oysters.
Well,

2077
02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:12.840
so we're quoting the guys like Rob Wolf,
these Paleo guys.

2078
02:05:12.841 --> 02:05:17.190
I say cholesterol is not the problem.
That the problem is that people are,

2079
02:05:17.191 --> 02:05:17.940
first of all,
they're,

2080
02:05:17.940 --> 02:05:22.140
they're eating a bunch of shitty foods and that they're eating a bunch of grains

2081
02:05:22.141 --> 02:05:27.141
and pastas and gluten based products and that they're not getting fat from

2082
02:05:27.481 --> 02:05:31.880
animals that live off a healthy diet,
grasp at diets,
you know,
and that,

2083
02:05:31.950 --> 02:05:36.950
that a body that lives under a grass fed meat and grass fed milk is actually a

2084
02:05:37.621 --> 02:05:41.490
far healthier than cows that are eating grains and fucking up their entire body

2085
02:05:41.491 --> 02:05:46.470
so that they can have good marbling for the steak.
Do you,
uh,
advise fighters on,

2086
02:05:46.471 --> 02:05:50.690
uh,
what type of protein they take in their body?
And how do you do that?
Well,

2087
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:54.030
they're different species at different times.
Sometimes you take a blend,

2088
02:05:54.031 --> 02:05:57.120
sometimes you take a,
you're talking about protein powders.

2089
02:05:57.120 --> 02:05:59.910
Are you talking about animals and sources?
Food.
I mean,
you,

2090
02:05:59.911 --> 02:06:03.390
you can protein powder all you want,
but at the end of the day there's this,

2091
02:06:03.410 --> 02:06:07.320
there's benefits to animal protein that you're not going to get from a way.

2092
02:06:07.530 --> 02:06:11.060
It's like wait powder.
Right,
right,
right.
What do you,
what do you advise,

2093
02:06:11.070 --> 02:06:15.450
don't make civic recommendations about what type of meat and and um,

2094
02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:19.320
in terms of food sources,
it doesn't have enough of an impact with compliance.
No,

2095
02:06:19.321 --> 02:06:23.400
I think it's important,
but if you had to advise and if someone,
uh,

2096
02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:26.400
what you want them to listen to you,
what would you say?
Like as far as like,

2097
02:06:26.401 --> 02:06:29.420
if you had to give,
if someone has the,
your ear,
they,

2098
02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:32.130
they give you their ear rather than 100% of were like,
listen,

2099
02:06:32.131 --> 02:06:34.950
please tell me everything to do.
What should I eat?

2100
02:06:35.070 --> 02:06:39.720
You mean in terms of optimal could fish and and optimal success?
Yeah.

2101
02:06:39.870 --> 02:06:44.280
Well what can we think about red meat that I advise people is cut it up into

2102
02:06:44.281 --> 02:06:46.500
small pieces.
You don't want these big chunks.

2103
02:06:46.501 --> 02:06:49.020
They're very difficult to digest and metabolize,

2104
02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:51.870
so a lot of guys really when they're starving to make weight,
they,

2105
02:06:51.890 --> 02:06:53.140
they'd be four or fight,

2106
02:06:53.170 --> 02:06:58.050
they want to eat red meat and I was advisor then cut it up into very small

2107
02:06:58.051 --> 02:07:01.110
pieces because you can really slow things down by trying to digest the big

2108
02:07:01.111 --> 02:07:04.530
chunks of meat and you should really chew the shit out of it to cut it up.

2109
02:07:04.531 --> 02:07:06.900
Really small pieces.
A lot of people don't like to chew their food.

2110
02:07:06.901 --> 02:07:11.730
They just like the wolf.
It have some sort of a lean,
lean hamburger,

2111
02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:17.030
good pasta and big chunks of meat all together.

2112
02:07:17.260 --> 02:07:21.810
Shut the fuck up,
bitch.
That's all of the garden.
You know?
You don't know.

2113
02:07:21.811 --> 02:07:25.380
You come here for one show,
I'm here for 300 of my hair.
That's olive garden.

2114
02:07:25.381 --> 02:07:29.510
Hundreds of times kid brings us no need to his favorite place.
He goes,

2115
02:07:32.190 --> 02:07:36.490
what have you done,
Mr Pie?
I hate to let the cat out of the bag,

2116
02:07:36.491 --> 02:07:39.830
but I've been with him to always talk before the show.
You talked,

2117
02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.020
you talked before the show Brian and they cheated.
Do you enjoy it yourself,
sir?

2118
02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:48.430
I'm sorry for sniffling in front of a microphone.
Ladies and gentlemen.

2119
02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:51.280
I like how you said yesterday you were like,
I never,
I don't,

2120
02:07:51.550 --> 02:07:54.100
this is rare as fucking traveled from Brazil.

2121
02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:59.380
I was hung over just two brouchers some Zma so Saturday night I had a little

2122
02:07:59.381 --> 02:08:04.120
absent with,
oh you did?
Yeah,
like they were legit stuff.
How was it?

2123
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:05.350
Fucking ridiculous.

2124
02:08:05.590 --> 02:08:09.970
But he don't feel good the next day and then I flew so I caught a little wee bit

2125
02:08:09.971 --> 02:08:12.910
of a cold.
It's rare for me,
but it's not even a real cold.

2126
02:08:12.911 --> 02:08:15.670
It's just sniffles like,
uh,
I worked out,
I felt great.

2127
02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:20.530
I just got this little sniffle thing going on and I also drank some milk because

2128
02:08:20.531 --> 02:08:25.000
I don't give a fuck.
They say,
Joe,
did Milko make your body produced more phlegm?

2129
02:08:25.330 --> 02:08:28.520
Well then it should stop being delicious cause I'm just going to have to file.

2130
02:08:28.521 --> 02:08:32.140
I'm not just going to eat my cookies without milk.
Son of a bitch.

2131
02:08:32.170 --> 02:08:36.940
I know what the fuck I'm doing.
I'm 11 life.
God dammit.
Live a life.

2132
02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:40.960
If it's not fun,
don't do it.
Come on man.
This exactly.
But you know,

2133
02:08:40.961 --> 02:08:42.730
I don't want to get arrested for cookies and milk.

2134
02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:45.880
Have you seen these people that are getting arrested for,
for raw milk though?

2135
02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:48.100
I say nothing.
I got a contact high in here.

2136
02:08:50.190 --> 02:08:53.100
You got one the moment you walked in.
What do you,

2137
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:55.720
what do you think about these people that are getting arrested for raw milk?

2138
02:08:55.721 --> 02:08:57.160
I mean to you and nutrition fan.

2139
02:08:57.180 --> 02:09:01.780
Are you just a fan of what works on performance athletes?
More about that.
That,

2140
02:09:01.781 --> 02:09:05.200
yeah.
So what do you eat yourself?
You just see it like a fucking wild animal.

2141
02:09:05.201 --> 02:09:09.400
Eat whatever you want.
Burgers.
But my wife cooks and she's the best in the world.

2142
02:09:09.730 --> 02:09:12.970
Is it Asian?
Oh,
here you go.
She Sam Simon,

2143
02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:17.680
you should go to the off guard with Brian.
Double Dare to Asian.
Double date.

2144
02:09:17.890 --> 02:09:21.820
Fucking freak.
Yeah.
Um,

2145
02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:24.850
so you,
uh,
do you train yourself?

2146
02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:26.350
<v 2>Do you exercise?
You know,</v>

2147
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:32.470
I actually came here through the airport in a wheelchair,

2148
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:36.740
a wheelchair.
I've got,
I've got some health issues that I'm dealing with now.

2149
02:09:36.741 --> 02:09:41.741
The bottom vertebrate brace slipped forward about 30% and I've got a pinched

2150
02:09:42.231 --> 02:09:45.860
nerve and it's really even difficult to walk.
Whoa.

2151
02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:49.210
I've been having some pretty serious health issues and,

2152
02:09:49.610 --> 02:09:53.690
and I go tomorrow for an MRI and then it's likely I'm going to have to have

2153
02:09:53.691 --> 02:09:57.020
surgery.
So most recently I've been really struggling with a lot of pain.

2154
02:09:57.260 --> 02:10:00.170
How did you a injury?
So I don't know.

2155
02:10:00.171 --> 02:10:04.050
I was a triple jumper and in high school and college and,

2156
02:10:04.051 --> 02:10:08.630
and maybe that was a part of it.
It could be genetic.
The doctor said,
uh,

2157
02:10:08.660 --> 02:10:10.970
I've had this for a long time.

2158
02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:14.960
I mean throughout the whole balco trial back from 2004 forward,

2159
02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:19.590
I would have difficulty even standing up.
Uh,
we went and made 15 appearances in,

2160
02:10:19.591 --> 02:10:23.330
in federal court.
So I've always had this problem.
But then I,
you know,

2161
02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:28.160
a while back,
it just,
um,
this bottom disc just slip or vertebrae,

2162
02:10:28.161 --> 02:10:31.280
excuse me,
slipped forward and started pinching the nerve.

2163
02:10:31.281 --> 02:10:34.850
And I've been really having problems.
I haven't been.
Um,

2164
02:10:35.660 --> 02:10:37.130
I would just think that,
you know,

2165
02:10:37.131 --> 02:10:40.130
working with all these guys and helping all these athletes,

2166
02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:42.280
you'd want to try some of that shit.
Oh yeah.

2167
02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:45.980
Barry bonds keeps coming back and bigger and bigger.
Like God damn,
very.

2168
02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:48.880
How's it feel?
Come on man.
What's it like being super bad?

2169
02:10:48.881 --> 02:10:52.620
I was the original Guinea pig for a lot of this stuff,
you know?

2170
02:10:52.670 --> 02:10:53.630
And what was it me,

2171
02:10:53.631 --> 02:10:58.040
you really felt a significant difference between how you felt?
Absolutely.

2172
02:10:58.190 --> 02:11:00.170
I mean for about seven years,
but then once,

2173
02:11:00.410 --> 02:11:05.210
once the 26 man Swat team with helicopters and assault rifles and flak jackets

2174
02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:08.000
came crashing through the door,
things changed.

2175
02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:12.560
Was It really 26 people would come to get you absolutely crazy.

2176
02:11:12.590 --> 02:11:16.890
I mean just,
they're back in the original building and it was just like a,

2177
02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:19.730
you would imagine a swat team going after bank.
Robert's Ge,

2178
02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:23.420
they pulled up and six,
seven black cars.
They filed out.

2179
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:25.700
They all got their guns and gotten a row.

2180
02:11:25.701 --> 02:11:29.000
I could see him through the window and then they just crashed through the front

2181
02:11:29.001 --> 02:11:33.580
door screaming.
Anybody got any weapons?
All the guns being pointed at us.
And,

2182
02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:38.990
and uh,
three of us came over the window.

2183
02:11:38.991 --> 02:11:43.430
No,
it was my VP and the office manager.
Wow.

2184
02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:46.280
And it was a crazy,
crazy experience.

2185
02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:50.870
And so did you have any inkling that this was going to ever happen?
Oh,

2186
02:11:50.871 --> 02:11:53.090
I knew they were coming.
You knew there were come.
Absolutely.

2187
02:11:53.190 --> 02:11:57.620
They were going through my trash every single week for an entire year.

2188
02:11:57.890 --> 02:12:02.180
They were copying my mail on a daily basis.
The mail man told us,
um,

2189
02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:08.270
here's,
here's basically what happened.
A guy across the freeway from Balco,

2190
02:12:08.330 --> 02:12:10.190
uh,
called up and said,

2191
02:12:10.910 --> 02:12:14.450
you guys need to come get your trash out of my trash band because,
uh,
you know,

2192
02:12:14.451 --> 02:12:15.590
I'm going to call the police.

2193
02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:20.630
So we went over there and found our garbage and brought it back over and have

2194
02:12:20.631 --> 02:12:25.310
the big black garbage bag and inside all the little white garbage bags

2195
02:12:25.311 --> 02:12:29.570
throughout the whole 7,000 square foot lab facility.
Uh,

2196
02:12:29.571 --> 02:12:33.230
you could see that they'd been going through these.
And then,
uh,

2197
02:12:33.290 --> 02:12:35.870
so we got a call a couple of weeks later and he said,
listen,

2198
02:12:35.871 --> 02:12:39.140
I told you to get this stuff out of here.
So,
uh,

2199
02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:41.810
we went back over there and got it again.
So I decided,
you know what,

2200
02:12:41.811 --> 02:12:43.190
let's just call the police ourselves.

2201
02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:46.880
So we called the Burlingame police department that came out,

2202
02:12:47.150 --> 02:12:50.730
we filed a police report.
They went over and,
uh,
Jeff Nowviskie was,

2203
02:12:50.731 --> 02:12:54.440
was illegally dumping the trash while eating a whatever the penal code is for

2204
02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:57.620
using somebody else's dumpster and a,

2205
02:12:57.621 --> 02:13:02.440
so they ended up writing an article about this in the Berlin game boutique and

2206
02:13:02.441 --> 02:13:04.940
village or the little rag newspaper there in Burlingame.

2207
02:13:05.330 --> 02:13:08.960
And apparently they delivered it to Novitsky his door and he realized that we

2208
02:13:08.961 --> 02:13:12.410
were onto him.
So shortly thereafter he became the swat team.

2209
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:16.340
They thought we were going to cover up all the evidence and destroy things.

2210
02:13:16.341 --> 02:13:17.880
They needed to act quickly.
So they,

2211
02:13:18.210 --> 02:13:22.670
they hustled and put together the Swat team and there was customs and you know,

2212
02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:27.170
narcotics,
IRS and you know,
many different agencies.

2213
02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:32.070
How stressful was that for you?
Well,
it was crazy.
I mean,
I,

2214
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:36.950
<v 5>it was surreal.
I would see a swat team,
well not,
I,</v>

2215
02:13:37.060 --> 02:13:39.900
you probably don't remember this,
but they had it on CNN.

2216
02:13:39.930 --> 02:13:42.180
It was all staged.

2217
02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:45.270
And how I know this is the,

2218
02:13:45.271 --> 02:13:48.730
soon as they came after us inside the building with the guns and they marched us

2219
02:13:48.731 --> 02:13:52.290
to the front door,
we sat in the lobby and I could look right out the front door.

2220
02:13:52.770 --> 02:13:56.760
And next thing you know,
here comes the,
uh,
the ABC,

2221
02:13:56.761 --> 02:13:59.400
the NBC,
the CBS,
uh,

2222
02:13:59.850 --> 02:14:04.680
trucks and up go the satellite dishes and like,
well,
Bam,

2223
02:14:04.681 --> 02:14:08.670
I don't understand.
I within a minute's time,
here's all the news.
And in fact,

2224
02:14:08.700 --> 02:14:13.700
ultimately I was able to get one of the people at NBC through a reporter that I

2225
02:14:13.921 --> 02:14:18.720
knew who had taken a picture of the helicopter.
And as it turned out,

2226
02:14:18.721 --> 02:14:19.940
they,
they,
you know,

2227
02:14:19.950 --> 02:14:24.950
said in the these legal documents that they didn't have a helicopter there,

2228
02:14:25.570 --> 02:14:25.900
but,

2229
02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:29.310
but it was hovering so close to the front door that the louvers over the window

2230
02:14:29.311 --> 02:14:33.990
actually cracked from the vibration.
And,
and I managed to get the,
uh,

2231
02:14:35.310 --> 02:14:36.430
a picture of,

2232
02:14:36.590 --> 02:14:41.160
of the helicopter and get the number off of it and trace it over the,

2233
02:14:41.161 --> 02:14:43.590
the bay there to Hayward.

2234
02:14:43.710 --> 02:14:47.700
And it was a company called helling that we went to their website and they did

2235
02:14:47.730 --> 02:14:51.990
all sorts of governmental work,
including the transport of nine us presidents.

2236
02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:56.490
So clearly it was them.
They just misrepresented this what we're really happened,

2237
02:14:56.850 --> 02:14:57.810
uh,
that day.

2238
02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:02.960
So what I'm trying to say is I found out that they contacted these news casters,

2239
02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:08.550
this is all illegal by the way.
They contacted these newscasters and said,

2240
02:15:08.730 --> 02:15:13.730
parked down the street with your vans and we're going to raid this place,

2241
02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:15.870
this balco laboratories,

2242
02:15:16.230 --> 02:15:19.980
and we don't want you to film the actual raid,

2243
02:15:19.981 --> 02:15:24.020
but we want you to get the aftermath.
So,

2244
02:15:24.030 --> 02:15:28.200
so it was all shades for television.
I mean,
this was,
I mean,

2245
02:15:28.201 --> 02:15:29.070
think about this.

2246
02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:34.220
I believe that this was in part a diversion of distraction from the war in Iraq.

2247
02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:41.400
I mean,
Whoa,
all of a sudden I became the Saddam Hussein of sport.

2248
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:42.630
I was this bad guy.

2249
02:15:43.450 --> 02:15:47.550
President Bush was talking about this in the state of the Union address.

2250
02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:51.000
John Ashcroft,
the u s attorney general is,

2251
02:15:51.020 --> 02:15:55.890
is announcing my indictment on the steps of the White House.
Um,
listen,

2252
02:15:55.891 --> 02:15:57.930
I pled guilty to,
uh,

2253
02:15:58.140 --> 02:16:02.280
I don't know if he had to know about units of a and the federal guidelines,

2254
02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:04.350
but at that particular time,

2255
02:16:04.370 --> 02:16:07.560
a 10 CC bottle is one unit of any type of steroid.

2256
02:16:07.710 --> 02:16:12.660
50 pills of any type of steroid was one unit.
Uh,

2257
02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:14.460
I pled to 25 units.

2258
02:16:14.461 --> 02:16:17.760
Understand that that's less than an ounce of marijuana.

2259
02:16:19.110 --> 02:16:23.430
So why would you bring all this firepower,
all these helicopters,

2260
02:16:23.670 --> 02:16:28.140
all this news media,
the whole thing was stage 25 units.

2261
02:16:28.590 --> 02:16:29.800
Will that fit in a bag?

2262
02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:30.710
<v 2>Well,</v>

2263
02:16:30.710 --> 02:16:35.710
it would be 25 bottles of steroids that would have 50 tablets or it would be 25,

2264
02:16:36.550 --> 02:16:40.390
a 10 cc bottles so easily.
That's the first little amount.

2265
02:16:40.391 --> 02:16:42.910
Folks who can't wrap their head around it,
it would go in a lunchbox.

2266
02:16:43.090 --> 02:16:44.120
It would go in a lunchbox.

2267
02:16:44.170 --> 02:16:48.430
The total value of everything that they found was less than $1,500.

2268
02:16:48.790 --> 02:16:53.060
<v 1>So they came in with 26 dudes in swat gear for</v>

2269
02:16:54.140 --> 02:16:56.750
<v 2>got the salt rifles.
But Penn does.
Yeah,</v>

2270
02:16:58.030 --> 02:17:02.570
so you get what I'm saying?
They knew that they had the names,

2271
02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:06.470
they knew that it was Barry bonds and Marion Jones.
Why do they care so much?

2272
02:17:06.471 --> 02:17:06.891
What is the,

2273
02:17:06.891 --> 02:17:11.450
what is the motivation behind chase the athletes about trophy hunting from day

2274
02:17:11.451 --> 02:17:15.800
number one because you have,
you know,
there were 10 baseball players.

2275
02:17:16.370 --> 02:17:19.580
Of those 10 I've got every single one of the grand jury testimonies.

2276
02:17:19.610 --> 02:17:24.530
They basically said the exact same thing as Barry bonds.
He was the only one,

2277
02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:26.690
I believe it's clearly selective prosecution.

2278
02:17:26.691 --> 02:17:28.400
He was the only one that was indicted.

2279
02:17:29.090 --> 02:17:33.410
So it was all about making an example because he's a famous guy because he's

2280
02:17:33.770 --> 02:17:35.690
famous and he will bring the most headlines

2281
02:17:35.770 --> 02:17:37.870
<v 1>and he was the guy who was knocking in the most home runs.</v>

2282
02:17:37.930 --> 02:17:41.860
So go after him and they didn't have enough money to prosecute everybody.

2283
02:17:41.861 --> 02:17:42.694
Is that what it was?

2284
02:17:42.770 --> 02:17:47.050
State's budget's didn't have enough money to prosecute all the athletes or did

2285
02:17:47.051 --> 02:17:50.500
they have some sort of a deal with baseball?
I count.
Does that work?

2286
02:17:51.870 --> 02:17:54.240
<v 2>Well,
you hear all sorts of numbers,
you know,</v>

2287
02:17:54.241 --> 02:17:57.600
55 60 and beyond.
Even before they,

2288
02:17:57.601 --> 02:18:02.450
they took Barry bonds and you know,
aside from balco with his own trial on,

2289
02:18:02.510 --> 02:18:06.030
on perjury,
I,
they probably spent $100 million.

2290
02:18:08.420 --> 02:18:13.140
It's hard to understand,
you know,
why they,
they look,

2291
02:18:13.650 --> 02:18:18.390
think about this aspect.
Novitsky Hey,
let me tell you how balco really started.

2292
02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:22.530
Okay.
There's no,
no one's heard this story back in,

2293
02:18:22.580 --> 02:18:23.820
in 1992

2294
02:18:25.770 --> 02:18:28.300
I was working with track athletes including Greg to false.

2295
02:18:28.350 --> 02:18:29.970
The guy that I told you that,
uh,

2296
02:18:30.090 --> 02:18:34.050
tested positive and they covered up his drug test.
And I was at the,
uh,

2297
02:18:34.110 --> 02:18:37.260
Bruce Jenner classic in San Jose at San Jose City College.

2298
02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:40.360
And I was working with a number of athletes that,
uh,

2299
02:18:40.410 --> 02:18:42.030
went to the college of San Mateo,

2300
02:18:42.060 --> 02:18:44.460
which is where no neato still does this track training.

2301
02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:48.900
And Greg's coach,
we won't name him for now,

2302
02:18:48.901 --> 02:18:52.920
was there and I saw him,
he was about 57 at the time.

2303
02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:55.950
Now he's probably 70 years old,
but he's still coaches up there.

2304
02:18:56.430 --> 02:19:00.510
And I walked up to the bend of the,
the,
uh,
200 meters.

2305
02:19:00.511 --> 02:19:01.800
They were getting ready to start the race.

2306
02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:05.680
And all of a sudden I realized that one of the young girl,

2307
02:19:05.681 --> 02:19:09.120
she was 19 at the time,
she became a national javelin champion,

2308
02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:13.980
was standing there with,
uh,
with his coach and I,

2309
02:19:13.981 --> 02:19:17.550
and all of a sudden she started scratching his arm and he started rubbing her.

2310
02:19:17.551 --> 02:19:21.460
And you could see the,
there was a little something going on there,
sex up.

2311
02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:26.300
The coach was doing the you son of a,
so I went back to Greg.

2312
02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:30.890
I said,
Greg G,
do you know that your coach is doing the student?

2313
02:19:31.490 --> 02:19:33.170
And he said,
dude,
you don't know the half of it.

2314
02:19:33.171 --> 02:19:35.540
We go to these meets and you know,
we can't find them.

2315
02:19:35.541 --> 02:19:36.810
And then we stumbled our way.
You know,

2316
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:39.830
we look all over the stadium and by the time we get out to his van,

2317
02:19:39.831 --> 02:19:43.160
he comes stumbling out,
you know,
buckling up his pants and stuff.

2318
02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:46.160
And so this had been going on for a long time.

2319
02:19:46.700 --> 02:19:51.700
While he told this person that I knew now just so happened that his boss was a

2320
02:19:52.191 --> 02:19:55.130
stockholder in balco.
He was afraid he was going to lose his job.

2321
02:19:55.131 --> 02:19:59.870
He was at San Francisco fireman in a day and he coached part time from that day

2322
02:19:59.871 --> 02:20:00.704
on.

2323
02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:05.300
That guy hated my guts every single time my name came up.

2324
02:20:05.301 --> 02:20:08.150
It was bad things to say.
Well,

2325
02:20:08.151 --> 02:20:13.151
his younger brother is the coach of the high school where Greg's kids went.

2326
02:20:13.161 --> 02:20:17.990
That's right over the freeway from,
from Balco.
His best friend is Jeff Novitsky.

2327
02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:23.000
So this is like a really bad grade.
Got Mad at me.

2328
02:20:23.060 --> 02:20:27.110
I have to follow it because when he found out I was given designers start to two

2329
02:20:27.111 --> 02:20:30.890
athletes,
he told his coach who told his brother,

2330
02:20:30.891 --> 02:20:34.370
who told him to [inaudible] and if [inaudible] knew that was Barry bonds and all

2331
02:20:34.371 --> 02:20:35.510
these elite athletes.

2332
02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:40.090
So for one year he came every single Monday night across the freeway live.

2333
02:20:40.091 --> 02:20:44.150
Ray still lives right over the freeway and with through my trash until he found

2334
02:20:44.151 --> 02:20:47.330
enough evidence to go to the prosecutor,

2335
02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:52.360
Jeff Ned row and get $300 to buy a membership to the world's gym right next door

2336
02:20:52.371 --> 02:20:56.720
to balco.
There were Barry bonds was trained by Greg Anderson.
And uh,

2337
02:20:56.930 --> 02:21:01.760
so all I'm saying is it was,
this is,
this is really how it started

2338
02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:06.200
and the rest is history as they sow trophy hunting.

2339
02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:11.260
So essentially prosecutors that wanted a big name case to make their careers.

2340
02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:15.530
And so they went after guys like Barry Bonds didn't go off to Mark McGuire that

2341
02:21:15.531 --> 02:21:19.460
much though,
Huh?
Well,
that was earlier.
Yeah.

2342
02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:22.640
That was five years earlier than this.
This was in 2003.

2343
02:21:22.670 --> 02:21:25.070
But when he came out and we wanted to get that coaching job,

2344
02:21:25.071 --> 02:21:28.130
he had a sort of admit that he took steroids,
right?
Yeah,
he did.

2345
02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:30.950
But everybody was like,
yeah,
it's okay.
You're a white guy,

2346
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:35.000
Barry bonds guys.
Well,

2347
02:21:35.001 --> 02:21:39.100
it is what it is in all of this.
That's the,

2348
02:21:39.101 --> 02:21:42.530
the the bottom line.
When I,
when I say an earlier,

2349
02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:45.920
I said what you had described was a mess.

2350
02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:49.070
This is a mess in my opinion.

2351
02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:52.130
What you have is one group of cheaters,

2352
02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:58.120
the athletes and those helping them being chased by another group of cheaters,

2353
02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:01.430
the law enforcement and anti-doping,

2354
02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:05.730
and they cheat equally as much if not more so than the athlete.

2355
02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:09.530
The anti-doping people cheat other than what you said before,
where they,

2356
02:22:09.531 --> 02:22:13.250
they get rid of some positive tests.
How the,
that was a while ago,
right?

2357
02:22:13.251 --> 02:22:14.084
There was all,

2358
02:22:14.110 --> 02:22:18.270
it's absolute propaganda by the government as well as the anti-doping really.

2359
02:22:18.470 --> 02:22:20.840
W let me give you an example.
Okay.
Kelly White,

2360
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:24.840
the one that I told you tested positive for Modafinil.
The very first one.
Yes.

2361
02:22:24.860 --> 02:22:26.370
When they came to her,

2362
02:22:26.370 --> 02:22:27.203
<v 5>they said,</v>

2363
02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:32.360
and this is what they do and why I'm so grateful that I never considered

2364
02:22:32.911 --> 02:22:35.220
cooperating with them in any way,
shape or form.

2365
02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:38.370
But they came to her and they said,
listen,
you're gonna get a two year ban,

2366
02:22:38.371 --> 02:22:41.640
will reinstate you in one year if you cooperate.
Here's what we want you to do.

2367
02:22:42.390 --> 02:22:47.280
They wrote a script and they had her go around all over New York,

2368
02:22:47.310 --> 02:22:48.690
Copenhagen,
London,

2369
02:22:48.691 --> 02:22:53.691
all these different places and tell lies that they knew were absolute lies.

2370
02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:58.260
In other words,
she'd used drugs for 2000,
2001,
2000,
two,

2371
02:22:58.261 --> 02:23:02.550
2003.
I,
they got all the,
the drug calendars they had them.

2372
02:23:03.180 --> 02:23:07.800
But the story was I went to this big bad wolf victor,

2373
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:09.750
and he told me that it was vitamins,

2374
02:23:09.751 --> 02:23:12.780
but two weeks later he called and told me that it was the real stuff.

2375
02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:17.960
And then I didn't take it again all the way until 2003 and then from March until

2376
02:23:18.571 --> 02:23:20.970
I became the double world champion.
Then I took him again.

2377
02:23:21.930 --> 02:23:26.250
She lied to the grand jury.
It said she,
she didn't inject EPO.

2378
02:23:26.430 --> 02:23:27.480
She committed perjury.

2379
02:23:27.481 --> 02:23:32.460
They never went after her at all while proof that she committed.
Absolutely.

2380
02:23:32.461 --> 02:23:36.010
She's on,
she's been with the black,
uh,
uh,
Guy,
uh,

2381
02:23:36.030 --> 02:23:39.990
James Brown on Hbo.
Real sports.
Later he says,

2382
02:23:39.991 --> 02:23:44.880
and I've got this video.
Did you use EPO?
Yes,
I did.
Well,
did you inject it?

2383
02:23:44.910 --> 02:23:49.830
Yes.
Where did you inject it?
On my stomach.
Was it painful?
Yes,
it was.
Well,

2384
02:23:49.831 --> 02:23:53.190
to the grand jury,
she said,
oh no,
I didn't use it.
They gave it to me,

2385
02:23:53.191 --> 02:23:57.600
but I flushed it down the toilet.
Whoa.
So she's absolutely lied,

2386
02:23:57.601 --> 02:24:00.720
committed perjury,
Sbo.
I mean,

2387
02:24:01.300 --> 02:24:05.580
I've got the video and the,
and the,
the grand jury transcript,
but here's,

2388
02:24:05.581 --> 02:24:10.440
here's how they play.
Then they came back to her and they said,

2389
02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:12.660
okay,
well you've done all these things.

2390
02:24:12.660 --> 02:24:14.520
You've testified against all these people.

2391
02:24:14.521 --> 02:24:18.150
You've said everything that we want you to say.
And she said,
great,

2392
02:24:18.151 --> 02:24:21.990
now reinstate me and let me get back on the track.
And I said,
oh,
well by the way,

2393
02:24:21.991 --> 02:24:24.240
we forgot to tell you,
Kelly,

2394
02:24:24.450 --> 02:24:27.180
you got to go to the IWF in every single penny.

2395
02:24:27.181 --> 02:24:29.460
You know that $350,000 that you made,

2396
02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:32.520
pay it all back to them and maybe they'll let you back.

2397
02:24:33.450 --> 02:24:36.360
You have to pay back everything you've ever earned as a track and field athlete.

2398
02:24:36.420 --> 02:24:38.370
Well,
they didn't tell her that upfront.

2399
02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:41.600
This is the kind of stuff that they do to,

2400
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:45.300
to anyone and everyone that does cooperate with them.
At the end of the day.

2401
02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:49.260
Let's look at this now.
Let's take it a step forward with Floyd Landis.

2402
02:24:49.261 --> 02:24:53.400
Remember when there was going to be the the whistle blower that they had the $30

2403
02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:56.970
million and he was going to get a certain percentage of that 10% or $3 million

2404
02:24:57.120 --> 02:25:00.850
and he filed a federal claim and he was cooperating with them and then at the

2405
02:25:00.850 --> 02:25:04.030
end of the day and now they charging him,
they're charging him with what?

2406
02:25:04.450 --> 02:25:06.360
What a fraud.

2407
02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:10.260
He raised $2 million by selling a book telling people he was clean when he knew

2408
02:25:10.261 --> 02:25:12.450
he was dirty.
Wow.

2409
02:25:13.940 --> 02:25:18.840
So all I'm saying is they,
they,
they,
they delete stuff in reports.

2410
02:25:18.841 --> 02:25:22.040
They say things that people,
me personally,
they,

2411
02:25:22.250 --> 02:25:25.630
they said that I said things the day of the raid that I never said and the

2412
02:25:25.631 --> 02:25:29.170
things that I did say,
they deleted it from the report.
Now understand,

2413
02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:34.200
I filed a declaration under penalty of perjury with the federal courts saying

2414
02:25:34.571 --> 02:25:38.320
that these guys lied in every single thing they said in this memorandum of

2415
02:25:38.321 --> 02:25:42.820
interview.
And all of this is missing from this memorandum of activity.
Will,

2416
02:25:42.821 --> 02:25:44.620
you don't see them coming after me for perjury?

2417
02:25:46.570 --> 02:25:50.020
<v 1>What hap complicated.
It's getting a little convoluted here.
Well,</v>

2418
02:25:50.021 --> 02:25:53.410
fortunately I see what you're saying and I see that you're saying that they're

2419
02:25:53.710 --> 02:25:56.440
corrupt and that class,

2420
02:25:56.530 --> 02:26:00.130
because both sides are cheating to win both sides of cheating to when I see what

2421
02:26:00.131 --> 02:26:01.540
you're saying,
prosecutors,
a cheating,

2422
02:26:01.541 --> 02:26:05.530
and that's often the case that people complained about all sorts of situations

2423
02:26:05.531 --> 02:26:07.660
where people get busted for something that the cops want to,

2424
02:26:07.990 --> 02:26:10.150
they want to pin them with the crime.

2425
02:26:10.151 --> 02:26:15.151
So they will sometimes manufacturer evidence and they will sometimes manipulate

2426
02:26:15.611 --> 02:26:19.210
the law.
There was some times and then what it takes to get the bad guy,

2427
02:26:19.810 --> 02:26:23.560
but the bad guy here it's,
it gets a little bit,
you know,

2428
02:26:23.561 --> 02:26:25.390
it's like who's the bad guy?
Is the bad guy,

2429
02:26:25.391 --> 02:26:29.560
the guy who took steroids so he could hit the ball better or is the bad guy,

2430
02:26:29.561 --> 02:26:34.190
the guy that spent hundreds of millions of dollars tax payer's money that could

2431
02:26:34.191 --> 02:26:38.830
have been spent on schools that could have been spent on health care,

2432
02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:42.400
lunch,
electricity,
different things,

2433
02:26:42.460 --> 02:26:44.350
all sorts of caught hire more cops.

2434
02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:48.820
Instead they spend it going after a fucking baseball player.
It's a,

2435
02:26:48.860 --> 02:26:51.160
we have a wacky set of priorities.

2436
02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:53.950
It's all that over that witch hunt shit.

2437
02:26:53.970 --> 02:26:57.360
Is that over or are they still doing that with guys?
Uh,
it's still going on.

2438
02:26:58.060 --> 02:27:00.190
Didn't mark wouldn't,
no.
Uh,
didn't,
um,

2439
02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:04.230
Roger Clemens just get off the whole thing and now he's going to start playing

2440
02:27:04.231 --> 02:27:05.064
baseball again

2441
02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:11.680
<v 5>at 50.
Yeah.
That brings up something.
I don't know that I can,
yeah,</v>

2442
02:27:11.770 --> 02:27:15.490
I don't think he will,
but there is talk about it.
I know he pitched,

2443
02:27:15.491 --> 02:27:20.430
you mean like a minor league?
They're in Texas.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

2444
02:27:21.070 --> 02:27:26.070
my understanding is that in a couple weeks,

2445
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:32.590
this is,
I've been told it's 99% sure that it's going to happen.

2446
02:27:32.770 --> 02:27:37.330
They're supposed to be in an event at Ucla,
uh,
an open

2447
02:27:38.860 --> 02:27:42.040
town hall type setting.
Uh,
there,
uh,

2448
02:27:42.041 --> 02:27:45.100
I was supposed to be on showtime with,
uh,

2449
02:27:46.030 --> 02:27:47.380
a panel of experts,

2450
02:27:47.530 --> 02:27:51.970
myself included and five or six other guys that,
that,
uh,

2451
02:27:52.570 --> 02:27:57.240
uh,
and the question is,
um,
baseball steroid era,
uh,

2452
02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:00.370
Barry bonds,
the greatest hitter of his generation.
Roger Clemens,

2453
02:28:00.371 --> 02:28:02.650
the greatest picture of his generation.

2454
02:28:02.770 --> 02:28:07.170
Do they belong in the in Baseball Hall of fame?
Who's going to be an interesting

2455
02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:10.920
<v 1>debate?
That is an interesting debate.
Um,
Carl Lewis,</v>

2456
02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:16.400
Ben Johnson tested positive and lost his gold medal because he tested positive

2457
02:28:16.771 --> 02:28:19.410
but didn't call Louis test positive that Olympics as well

2458
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:22.250
<v 5>earlier did.
Yes.</v>

2459
02:28:24.470 --> 02:28:29.160
So at the trials,
this all came out in 1988 well,
let,
let's,

2460
02:28:29.310 --> 02:28:31.400
let me put that in context of the statistics.

2461
02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:35.960
They had a hundred positive tests.

2462
02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:38.150
The United States Olympic Committee,

2463
02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:43.240
and listen back in 1988 50 of those were covered up those 50 athletes.

2464
02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:49.010
They won 19 Olympic medals.

2465
02:28:49.660 --> 02:28:53.390
<v 1>The ones that were covered up and Carl is one of those.
Oh my God.
No.</v>

2466
02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:56.650
How do they do that?
How do they decide who was covered up and who doesn't?

2467
02:28:56.890 --> 02:28:58.480
<v 5>Well,
library,
no.</v>

2468
02:28:58.481 --> 02:29:03.481
What happened was that they were doing a task and the this committee and all the

2469
02:29:04.031 --> 02:29:05.020
minutes or it came out,

2470
02:29:05.021 --> 02:29:10.021
this was published in 2009 in the Orange County register and they basically

2471
02:29:10.241 --> 02:29:13.450
said,
well listen,
our whole team will,
you know,

2472
02:29:13.630 --> 02:29:16.750
a lot of it will not be going to the Olympics if we come out with this.

2473
02:29:16.900 --> 02:29:20.920
So let's just say that this particular testing was experimental and let's take

2474
02:29:20.921 --> 02:29:22.930
the B sample and poured down the drain.

2475
02:29:23.670 --> 02:29:24.503
<v 1>Whoa.</v>

2476
02:29:24.780 --> 02:29:27.870
Because it was just too costly for the teams as far as records are concerned.

2477
02:29:28.230 --> 02:29:31.200
As far as what would rather tell him going possible.

2478
02:29:31.740 --> 02:29:35.300
<v 5>Present the United States,
that is the group where they had,</v>

2479
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:37.010
they had a hundred positives,

2480
02:29:37.011 --> 02:29:41.380
50 were covered up these and selectively that he was one of those,
those 50

2481
02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:46.190
<v 1>there was always a deal with a that Olympics that there was corruption that</v>

2482
02:29:46.191 --> 02:29:51.020
Olympics because of Roy Jones loss in the finals against the Korean fighter,

2483
02:29:51.350 --> 02:29:56.350
which was one of the worst shitty decisions in boxing history or Roy Jones lit

2484
02:29:57.291 --> 02:30:01.010
this kid up like a Christmas tree and at the end of it they gave the decision to

2485
02:30:01.011 --> 02:30:03.230
the Korean and everybody weighed us wine.
Why?

2486
02:30:03.800 --> 02:30:05.930
I mean it was one of the most read in Korea.

2487
02:30:05.960 --> 02:30:09.110
It was one of the most ridiculous shows of corruption ever.

2488
02:30:09.180 --> 02:30:14.180
<v 5>So let me suggest that when you can watch this recent 9.79 asterik show,</v>

2489
02:30:17.760 --> 02:30:20.520
because they interview all the eight guys that were in the race.

2490
02:30:20.521 --> 02:30:24.570
But the most interesting part is a friend of Carl Lewis's and they even

2491
02:30:24.571 --> 02:30:29.550
interviewed as manager Joe Douglas got into the actual drug testing room where

2492
02:30:29.551 --> 02:30:34.100
Ben Johnson was.
And Charlie had told me this as well,
listen,
the,
the,
the,

2493
02:30:34.110 --> 02:30:34.943
this is a,

2494
02:30:34.950 --> 02:30:39.450
was a set up here and he was drinking beer to show he could urinate.

2495
02:30:39.930 --> 02:30:44.760
And they actually showed pictures on this show of this guy sitting next to Ben

2496
02:30:44.760 --> 02:30:48.150
Johnson and the beer.
And he wouldn't go on camera,

2497
02:30:48.151 --> 02:30:50.960
but at the end and turn it always said that it was sabotage,

2498
02:30:50.961 --> 02:30:54.420
that somebody spiked his,
his beer with us,
the nozzle,

2499
02:30:54.421 --> 02:30:57.470
all a winstrol tablet.
And uh,

2500
02:30:57.960 --> 02:31:00.480
when they asked the guy to go on the record,
he said,
no,

2501
02:31:00.481 --> 02:31:04.760
but he made a statement and they said,
well,
did you,
you know,
did you,
uh,

2502
02:31:05.220 --> 02:31:09.570
sabotage Ben Johnson and put a,
a winstrol tablet in his beer?

2503
02:31:09.720 --> 02:31:12.270
And he said,
maybe I did and maybe I didn't.

2504
02:31:13.880 --> 02:31:14.630
<v 1>Wait a minute.</v>

2505
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:17.920
So Ben Johnson wasn't on steroids when he competed in the Olympic Games.

2506
02:31:17.930 --> 02:31:20.040
He was clearly on,
because it all

2507
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:24.390
<v 5>came out in the Dublin inquiry later when when they brought in all the athletes</v>

2508
02:31:24.391 --> 02:31:29.340
and his team
a point where he was in undetectable levels for tests,

2509
02:31:29.341 --> 02:31:32.730
they just tapered oftentime cause there was no out of competition testing.

2510
02:31:32.731 --> 02:31:33.750
So they'd done this many,

2511
02:31:33.751 --> 02:31:38.250
many times and they just would go off three weeks out knowing that it would take

2512
02:31:38.251 --> 02:31:39.360
that long to clear.

2513
02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:43.050
They'd done it many world championships and other meats before and that

2514
02:31:43.051 --> 02:31:46.350
particular competition,
he came up positive.

2515
02:31:46.370 --> 02:31:49.110
<v 3>It didn't he come up really positive too,
like well look,</v>

2516
02:31:49.120 --> 02:31:53.380
it would've been a huge mistake.
Yes.
Yeah,
it was a little obvious.
Wow,

2517
02:31:53.381 --> 02:31:55.300
that's amazing.
So he was sabotaged.

2518
02:31:55.540 --> 02:31:59.860
So it's like everybody knew don't cue the beach,
whatever music.

2519
02:32:00.490 --> 02:32:02.350
Everybody knew that it was a,

2520
02:32:02.840 --> 02:32:06.440
<v 5>well this is this what the guy was taking this story.
Hi,
first of all,</v>

2521
02:32:06.441 --> 02:32:11.060
how did that guy get in there?
Yeah,
that's the question.
And he's Carl Lewis,

2522
02:32:11.061 --> 02:32:12.920
his friend,
and Joe Douglas said,

2523
02:32:12.921 --> 02:32:16.640
we managed to do what it took to get the credentials to get the guy in there.

2524
02:32:17.590 --> 02:32:19.690
<v 3>So this is always going to be two people who cheat.</v>

2525
02:32:20.120 --> 02:32:21.430
There's always going to be weirdness.

2526
02:32:21.790 --> 02:32:26.710
What'd you think about like a Margarita with the loaded gloves?
Well,

2527
02:32:26.711 --> 02:32:31.480
that was really bad.
That was the one that,
do you remember the Billy resto days?

2528
02:32:32.410 --> 02:32:34.790
Panama Lewis and Gusto?
The hold,

2529
02:32:35.010 --> 02:32:39.730
they took the hide out of a kid's gloves or think Billy custody.

2530
02:32:39.760 --> 02:32:44.530
Not Billy Costello,
I forgot the kid's name,
but uh,
it went blind.
Went blind,

2531
02:32:44.531 --> 02:32:48.060
lost part of his vision.
Couldn't box again.
That's his full intention.
Yeah,

2532
02:32:48.220 --> 02:32:50.140
it's a,
there's always been cheating,
man.

2533
02:32:50.260 --> 02:32:53.470
So He's been cheating people just winning.
It's so fucking awesome.

2534
02:32:55.090 --> 02:32:57.030
How do you keep guys from cheating now if you're,

2535
02:32:57.040 --> 02:32:59.710
if you're working with all these athletes and you have this past,

2536
02:32:59.980 --> 02:33:01.900
I mean obviously the threat of going back to jail,

2537
02:33:01.901 --> 02:33:03.880
I'm sure shit isn't enticing to you,

2538
02:33:04.180 --> 02:33:06.790
but how do you keep athletes on the straight now?

2539
02:33:07.810 --> 02:33:12.670
The only way that's going to happen is if the people that make the majority of

2540
02:33:12.671 --> 02:33:17.590
the money from sport,
whether that be baseball,
football,
UFC,
Olympics,

2541
02:33:17.591 --> 02:33:21.220
whoever it is,
when they develop a genuine interest,

2542
02:33:21.280 --> 02:33:24.940
then they can implement a reasonably effective testing program.

2543
02:33:25.210 --> 02:33:28.770
While you're not relies on state athletic commissions,
you know,
it's uh,

2544
02:33:28.830 --> 02:33:29.663
it's over.
It's,

2545
02:33:29.790 --> 02:33:32.710
it could be said that it's overstepping their boundaries if they incorporate

2546
02:33:32.711 --> 02:33:33.491
their own testing.

2547
02:33:33.491 --> 02:33:35.830
It's almost like saying you don't know what you're doing in Nevada state

2548
02:33:35.831 --> 02:33:38.790
athletic commission.
We're going to do our own shit.
Cause that,

2549
02:33:38.810 --> 02:33:40.360
is that a religion?
I'm an argument or,
no,

2550
02:33:42.930 --> 02:33:45.940
I mean it seems like if you want the sanctioning of an athletic commission,

2551
02:33:45.941 --> 02:33:49.240
the idea is that they get paid to do that.
They get paid to test people.

2552
02:33:49.450 --> 02:33:51.550
So if you come in and you know,
you say,
look,

2553
02:33:51.551 --> 02:33:54.580
we're going to do your job because you suck at it like that,
that could,

2554
02:33:54.610 --> 02:33:56.680
that could ruffle feathers.
No,
of course.

2555
02:33:57.220 --> 02:33:59.060
But it should be done anyways that we were saying you,

2556
02:33:59.110 --> 02:34:01.600
you need a certain standardization,

2557
02:34:01.790 --> 02:34:05.440
but those athletic commissions are not providing that.
Absolutely not.

2558
02:34:05.470 --> 02:34:07.930
The level of testing they provide is an absolute joke.

2559
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:11.590
So they provide a level of testing that is through urine only,
correct?

2560
02:34:11.980 --> 02:34:15.640
That's correct.
And it needs to be through blood and needs to be through both.

2561
02:34:15.910 --> 02:34:20.470
Both blood and like EPO is urine.
They don't do EPO.
Okay.

2562
02:34:21.150 --> 02:34:24.460
The carbon isotope ratio for synthetic testosterone,
that's a urine test.

2563
02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:28.990
I wrote a,
I'd rather read a defense.
Someone was saying,
well,

2564
02:34:29.020 --> 02:34:33.580
boxers,
a EPO is not really a drug that concerns us because boxers don't use it.

2565
02:34:33.850 --> 02:34:38.350
No.
I was like,
what am I,
let me say this.
If I had to pick a single drug,

2566
02:34:38.351 --> 02:34:42.430
that would be the most powerful performance enhancer.

2567
02:34:43.210 --> 02:34:46.750
It's EPO.
Yeah.
How could they possibly say that?
I read that and I was like,

2568
02:34:46.751 --> 02:34:51.220
that is the most ridiculous.
Robert Voi and David Watson,

2569
02:34:51.221 --> 02:34:54.940
this was at a hearing with Keith Kaiser,

2570
02:34:54.941 --> 02:34:56.380
the Nevada State Athletic Commission.

2571
02:34:56.381 --> 02:34:59.680
They got up and then there was a headline that said,
uh,
you know,

2572
02:34:59.681 --> 02:35:04.660
you're on testing,
knock kales blood testing.
They were saying,
you don't need to.

2573
02:35:04.661 --> 02:35:08.500
Why do you need to do this test?
Why do you need to test for EPO?

2574
02:35:08.501 --> 02:35:12.730
Nobody's using EPO,
but that's an endurance.
I mean,
how could anybody say that?

2575
02:35:12.910 --> 02:35:16.450
It's an endurance enhancer and a massive endurance in heads in a word.

2576
02:35:16.870 --> 02:35:19.300
I don't care who you are.
Uh,

2577
02:35:19.450 --> 02:35:24.450
Dwayne chambers described it best one time when he said it turns you into a

2578
02:35:24.521 --> 02:35:27.550
machine.
How many MMA fighters do you think are on EPL?

2579
02:35:32.580 --> 02:35:35.100
Well,
often total of all performance announcing drugs,

2580
02:35:35.101 --> 02:35:40.101
it's in the neighborhood of 50% maybe 20% so 20% capacity would be at APL.

2581
02:35:40.830 --> 02:35:44.280
So when you see people with ridiculous cardio and they can go five rounds at

2582
02:35:44.281 --> 02:35:47.670
100% clip,
you get suspicious.
It's fair,

2583
02:35:47.700 --> 02:35:51.270
very easy to get this stuff and use this stuff.
And there's no test for it.

2584
02:35:51.330 --> 02:35:54.760
In the blue curve.
There is a test for it.
But I'm saying in the,
in Nevada,
Nevada,

2585
02:35:55.440 --> 02:35:58.470
California doesn't do it in New York,
doesn't do a state commissions,

2586
02:35:58.471 --> 02:35:59.430
do not do it.

2587
02:35:59.730 --> 02:36:04.730
They only test for what they test for testosterone versus epitestosterone

2588
02:36:05.881 --> 02:36:09.720
ratios.
They test for things that are,
it's minimal testing,
right.
And,

2589
02:36:09.740 --> 02:36:12.450
and the panel of anabolic steroids.

2590
02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:17.600
So you get that panel of about 30 to 35 steroids plus the t ratio is included.

2591
02:36:18.180 --> 02:36:21.930
Long story short,
I used to buy those tests from quest diagnostic,

2592
02:36:21.931 --> 02:36:26.580
the exact company that does the Nevada state athletic commission testing for $80

2593
02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:30.320
so what would a blood test?
A blood in urine,

2594
02:36:30.330 --> 02:36:33.720
the the correct type of testing costs.
How much difference are we talking about?

2595
02:36:33.870 --> 02:36:38.010
Pos or $400 test?
Growth Hormone is a $400 test.
Okay,

2596
02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:40.530
so those are two different tests.
Let's round it off.

2597
02:36:40.531 --> 02:36:43.560
Let's call it $1,000 so you're dealing with 11 fighters,

2598
02:36:43.561 --> 02:36:48.150
22 five two $22,000 so $22,000 savings.

2599
02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:49.340
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2600
02:36:49.340 --> 02:36:50.990
<v 3>How much are they getting paid for those events though?</v>

2601
02:36:51.430 --> 02:36:53.450
It seems like they're probably getting a lot of money for those events.

2602
02:36:53.451 --> 02:36:56.300
They can't talk about $22,000 for proper testing.

2603
02:36:57.500 --> 02:36:58.760
Do you think they have pressure?

2604
02:36:58.850 --> 02:37:03.440
Do you think that it's like the casinos scholars?
No need to get crazy.

2605
02:37:03.830 --> 02:37:08.830
You're testing a little about the potential for financial loss and is it all

2606
02:37:08.901 --> 02:37:13.310
about the,
the image?
Like it looks like they're testing,
but meanwhile they're,

2607
02:37:13.370 --> 02:37:16.070
they're,
they're,
they're just making it so

2608
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:20.030
<v 2>that they know,
they tell you how to cheat because they say,
listen,</v>

2609
02:37:20.031 --> 02:37:24.410
come in here and you're good.
Yeah.
So you're like,
okay,
yes.
Wow.

2610
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:27.810
What can be done?
What can we do,
uh,

2611
02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:31.880
implement reasonably effective testing and that you don't have to go crazy.

2612
02:37:31.910 --> 02:37:35.000
What do they do if they find out when they implement recently effective Tesla,

2613
02:37:35.070 --> 02:37:35.960
everybody's on.

2614
02:37:36.170 --> 02:37:39.950
And then when everybody gets off the performance socks and it becomes like women

2615
02:37:39.951 --> 02:37:42.010
trying to chase those Olympics,
uh,

2616
02:37:42.011 --> 02:37:46.100
metals at the Russians made when they were hopped up on Dick Sauce.
Okay.

2617
02:37:46.101 --> 02:37:50.630
I think that answer has been provided,
um,
by baseball.

2618
02:37:51.530 --> 02:37:54.290
Look at the home run totals.
Right.
But they only did it,
test it twice.

2619
02:37:54.291 --> 02:37:58.880
He said it tested twice.
And that's a very small amount of,
when I say reasonable,

2620
02:37:58.881 --> 02:38:03.590
that's not reasonable.
The point is beef,
they had no testing.

2621
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:07.670
Uh,
they started in 2004.
So back in the day,

2622
02:38:07.671 --> 02:38:12.080
there was no testing,
which meant that's like back in the flow,
Joe Days,

2623
02:38:12.410 --> 02:38:15.710
you do whatever you want as much as you want at any time.

2624
02:38:15.890 --> 02:38:19.340
And nobody's paying attention.
Flo Jo died,
right?
Yes.
She's,

2625
02:38:19.970 --> 02:38:23.360
she dies a result of performance enhancing drugs.
My opinion,

2626
02:38:23.361 --> 02:38:26.540
I think there's a connection.
What did she die of?
Listen,

2627
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:30.590
I've said this before and,
and uh,
uh,
I will,

2628
02:38:30.650 --> 02:38:34.730
I've been told that there were three positive drug tests that were covered up at

2629
02:38:34.731 --> 02:38:37.360
the Olympic Games and you have to look at,

2630
02:38:37.580 --> 02:38:42.410
at the highly suspicious nature of what happened with Flo Jo.

2631
02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:47.330
She was 27 years old at the height of her economic earning potential.

2632
02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:52.280
She came home from the Olympic Games and retired.
Does that make sense?

2633
02:38:52.610 --> 02:38:56.200
No.
Okay.
No it doesn't.
So what do you think was wrong?
Well,
sorry.

2634
02:38:56.270 --> 02:38:59.930
I've been told that there were three positive drug tests and that she was one of

2635
02:38:59.931 --> 02:39:04.220
them.
Now you call it a rumor,
call it what you want,
but,
but I believe that,
uh,

2636
02:39:04.221 --> 02:39:08.210
you know,
I was told three specific names of all gold medalist.

2637
02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:10.900
So they essentially told her it's time to wrap it up because we know you're

2638
02:39:10.930 --> 02:39:14.960
cheating.
Well,
she was an interesting case too because she was a,
I wouldn't,

2639
02:39:14.961 --> 02:39:16.580
I wouldn't say a mediocre runner,

2640
02:39:16.790 --> 02:39:21.020
but she was nowhere near the level that she was at her prime just a couple of

2641
02:39:21.021 --> 02:39:24.230
years previous to that,
in the 84 Olympics,

2642
02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:29.500
her hundred meter best was 10 96 and 200 meter was 2196 four years later in

2643
02:39:30.481 --> 02:39:34.970
[inaudible] 88 Adh rent 2134,
so 96 to 34,

2644
02:39:35.270 --> 02:39:36.920
five,
six meters faster.

2645
02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:41.450
And from 10 96 to 10 49 which is four or five meters faster,

2646
02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:44.270
she says grace,
that's fast.

2647
02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:48.140
Imagine if you're running and she's five meters ahead of you.

2648
02:39:48.170 --> 02:39:51.560
Many people said that they sold her all kinds of drugs.
Uh,

2649
02:39:51.561 --> 02:39:55.940
a 400 meter runner from,
I believe he was from Seattle.
Darryl Robinson,

2650
02:39:56.200 --> 02:39:59.300
you know,
came forward on the today show and said that,
listen,

2651
02:39:59.301 --> 02:40:04.280
I sold her all kinds of drugs.
So that was a sad story.
27 years old.

2652
02:40:04.281 --> 02:40:06.830
How old was she when she died?
38 or nine.

2653
02:40:08.330 --> 02:40:11.480
That's a sad story.
Now.
Uh,
Lance Armstrong,

2654
02:40:12.190 --> 02:40:15.770
they're going to get this car it seems like now.
What are some today?
Yeah,

2655
02:40:15.860 --> 02:40:18.300
like Nike dropped him today and he read,

2656
02:40:18.301 --> 02:40:21.660
he stepped down from his position with live strong.
Yeah.

2657
02:40:21.661 --> 02:40:25.800
So it seems like the walls are closing in on him now.
This is a,

2658
02:40:25.801 --> 02:40:29.490
that's two things to happen in one day like that it seems like it's almost over.

2659
02:40:29.730 --> 02:40:34.560
But they,
they have like 500 negative tests from this guy.

2660
02:40:35.050 --> 02:40:39.050
Some say that's an inflated number.
It was closer.
He claims five to 600.

2661
02:40:39.051 --> 02:40:43.380
Literally it's 20.
So what does that tell you?
Say It's,
say it's 250,
let's,

2662
02:40:43.381 --> 02:40:45.390
let's cut his number and has,
did it right.

2663
02:40:45.391 --> 02:40:49.440
What does that tell you about the effectiveness of the testing?
Says it's shit,

2664
02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:51.780
especially with the blood doping,
right?

2665
02:40:51.781 --> 02:40:54.920
Because they can't really tell that you did that.
How did they tell that you,

2666
02:40:54.921 --> 02:40:57.690
you took your blood and froze it and then stuck it back in your body?

2667
02:40:57.691 --> 02:41:02.430
How are they there?
Some,
they can look at a percentage,
uh,
of,
of young,

2668
02:41:02.431 --> 02:41:06.300
middle aged and older red blood cells.
And if that percentage is outside,

2669
02:41:06.301 --> 02:41:08.970
then have they ever brought a case and made it stick?

2670
02:41:09.180 --> 02:41:13.320
It's very tough because that's subjective a test,
but here,

2671
02:41:13.321 --> 02:41:14.400
here's you know,

2672
02:41:14.710 --> 02:41:19.710
just this is a rumor that I heard but it makes a lot of sense.

2673
02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:21.293
Um,

2674
02:41:21.480 --> 02:41:26.480
I th this is what I believe they do is during each and every stage they wait

2675
02:41:26.551 --> 02:41:29.980
until they know the testing window is over and then they reinfuse their,

2676
02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:33.450
their red blood cells,
they come back at the end of the stage,

2677
02:41:33.810 --> 02:41:37.290
they extract those red blood cells.
So if they get tested in the morning,

2678
02:41:37.291 --> 02:41:39.720
they're going to be within the normal range.

2679
02:41:40.380 --> 02:41:44.940
They also take testosterone either by cream gel or patch,

2680
02:41:45.390 --> 02:41:48.540
which as I talked about with baseball players,
it goes up and goes down.

2681
02:41:48.541 --> 02:41:51.570
So by that time in the morning when you would be tested,
you,

2682
02:41:51.571 --> 02:41:53.430
it'd be within the normal t ratio.

2683
02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:57.400
The joke that was going around was that with Floyd Landis that the,

2684
02:41:57.420 --> 02:42:01.590
he had horrible stage 16 came in that night and got drunk and forgot to take the

2685
02:42:01.591 --> 02:42:06.330
patch off.
Tested positive 11 to one is t ratio in the morning.

2686
02:42:06.420 --> 02:42:09.360
Really.
Whether that's true or not,
I don't know.

2687
02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:14.660
But what I'm saying is they're now using this term right under the testers

2688
02:42:16.951 --> 02:42:20.970
noses,
meaning they're doing this on a daily basis.

2689
02:42:21.080 --> 02:42:22.560
And did Lance Armstrong,

2690
02:42:22.650 --> 02:42:25.550
Lance Armstrong get away with it for so long because he was the poster boy

2691
02:42:25.570 --> 02:42:27.720
because he was the golden child.
Well,

2692
02:42:27.721 --> 02:42:32.250
they supposedly now or accusing the cycling union,

2693
02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:36.720
um,
of helping cover up a positive drug test where he,

2694
02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:40.500
he gave $100,000 to them and the next thing you know,

2695
02:42:40.501 --> 02:42:44.760
they had a 60 to $70,000 a piece of equipment that they were using in the

2696
02:42:44.761 --> 02:42:49.320
laboratory.
Um,
do I think it's possible?

2697
02:42:49.321 --> 02:42:54.270
I do,
you know,
will that ever get to a court of law with a,

2698
02:42:54.271 --> 02:42:59.180
with a beyond a reasonable doubt standard?
I don't know,
but were,

2699
02:42:59.210 --> 02:43:03.480
there are a lot of people in on it.
Of course.
That's my opinion there.

2700
02:43:03.481 --> 02:43:06.300
This just didn't happen.
You know,
many people knew about this,

2701
02:43:06.301 --> 02:43:09.290
that were involved in the business.
It was good for business.
Uh,

2702
02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:11.980
and a lot of people were making a lot of money and I think a lot of people were

2703
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:14.950
<v 5>looking the other way.
This is such a fascinating subject.
I'm,</v>

2704
02:43:14.970 --> 02:43:18.700
I'm so obsessed with the idea of this constant desire to like,

2705
02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:20.080
especially in track and field,

2706
02:43:20.081 --> 02:43:24.700
to just shave tenths of a second in seconds off of your time and you know it.

2707
02:43:24.701 --> 02:43:26.950
So let's talk about that for just a second.

2708
02:43:26.951 --> 02:43:31.951
Cause I wrote an article about this in the New York Daily News back starting and

2709
02:43:32.890 --> 02:43:35.710
it was right before the Beijing Olympics in 2008.

2710
02:43:36.070 --> 02:43:40.210
And this was when it first came to my attention and I,
my opinion is that memo,

2711
02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:42.920
the same guy that was in the balco case,

2712
02:43:43.290 --> 02:43:45.730
Novitsky got no consequence and he's still out there.

2713
02:43:46.030 --> 02:43:51.030
But I s I watched the women's a hundred meter final at the Jamaican trials and

2714
02:43:53.110 --> 02:43:56.890
Veronica Campbell was an Olympic gold medalist and a world champion.

2715
02:43:56.891 --> 02:44:01.510
And I mean really just one of the best sprinters we expected to win both events

2716
02:44:01.511 --> 02:44:02.344
at the trials.

2717
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:06.640
She ran a very fast 10 88 and came in fourth.

2718
02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:11.770
Didn't even make the team,
and the hundred meters said,
who are these people,

2719
02:44:11.771 --> 02:44:14.590
these other girls?
Where are they coming from?
Well,

2720
02:44:14.591 --> 02:44:16.580
let's go back and look at Shellyann Frazier,

2721
02:44:16.690 --> 02:44:20.530
who's won the gold medal in London and won the gold medal in Beijing.

2722
02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:26.040
And if you go back and look at the Times that she ran in 2007 a year before the

2723
02:44:27.430 --> 02:44:27.640
Beijing Olympics,

2724
02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:32.640
she ran a 1135 she showed up at Beijing rent 10 78 that's five meters faster.

2725
02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:41.140
Now here's my experience with Kelly White.
I helped her.

2726
02:44:41.141 --> 02:44:44.020
She obviously use drugs and she became a double world champion.

2727
02:44:44.350 --> 02:44:49.350
Her lifetime PR was 1119 I gave her very sophisticated drug regimen.

2728
02:44:50.470 --> 02:44:55.470
She rent 10 10 85 so she went from 1119 to 10 85 this Jamaican girl went from

2729
02:44:56.111 --> 02:45:01.111
1135 to 10 78 how do you improve five meters in one year?

2730
02:45:02.110 --> 02:45:05.860
So what happened at the Olympics?
They want gold,
silver,
bronze,

2731
02:45:05.861 --> 02:45:10.390
and the 100 meter of this very small country wins all three metals in the

2732
02:45:10.390 --> 02:45:12.130
hundred meters.
But let's fast forward.

2733
02:45:12.580 --> 02:45:17.580
What just happened in London is from the exact same coach Glen Mills.

2734
02:45:18.851 --> 02:45:23.680
They're on this very small island and the 200 meter they went gold,

2735
02:45:23.681 --> 02:45:28.300
silver and bronze,
all three places,
not just from the same,
same.

2736
02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:30.850
There's two track clubs,
MVP and racers,
track club,

2737
02:45:30.851 --> 02:45:35.470
which is you saying bolts to a team.
They won the gold,

2738
02:45:35.471 --> 02:45:38.710
silver and bronze in the hundred meters.
They won gold and silver,

2739
02:45:39.220 --> 02:45:42.150
so they won five out of the six gold medals in this.

2740
02:45:42.170 --> 02:45:43.900
What are they the same coach?
What are they doing?

2741
02:45:46.270 --> 02:45:49.390
Probably a lot of stuff and to just doing my opinion,

2742
02:45:49.391 --> 02:45:52.930
tapering off before the Olympics and still keeping the effects because they

2743
02:45:52.931 --> 02:45:57.931
don't go there during the off season that I described that October through

2744
02:45:58.300 --> 02:46:02.590
January period I believe it's just open season greenlight use and do whatever

2745
02:46:02.591 --> 02:46:04.720
you want.
What's going to happen if they ever do that?

2746
02:46:04.721 --> 02:46:08.590
How much are Tom's going to drop?
Significantly significant.

2747
02:46:08.630 --> 02:46:10.460
I mean real significant

2748
02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:12.890
<v 1>track and field.
It's just completely infested.</v>

2749
02:46:13.130 --> 02:46:16.130
<v 5>Absolutely.
And then here,
here's what comes next.</v>

2750
02:46:16.580 --> 02:46:18.200
Then the coach says,

2751
02:46:18.201 --> 02:46:22.910
not only are my guys so good if I could have had five guys on the team,

2752
02:46:22.911 --> 02:46:26.720
we would have won the first five places and sure enough in the,

2753
02:46:26.721 --> 02:46:31.190
in the remainder of the season they had about five more meets after the Olympics

2754
02:46:31.191 --> 02:46:36.191
in London to more guidance from the all training partners ran times faster than

2755
02:46:36.651 --> 02:46:38.000
everybody else in the world.

2756
02:46:38.090 --> 02:46:43.090
So the top five times and the 200 meters in the world are all from the same code

2757
02:46:43.851 --> 02:46:44.200
coach.

2758
02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:46.170
<v 1>You going to get a Jamaican hitman knocking on your door,</v>

2759
02:46:46.430 --> 02:46:49.080
Vic dip conte want to talk to you man,

2760
02:46:49.530 --> 02:46:52.620
you got a problem with Jamaicans running fast.

2761
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:58.290
It's the mountain yams.
Yeah.
Mon Yams are the shit and Jakks too,
right?

2762
02:46:58.291 --> 02:47:01.140
Brian Acme me.
Acme.
It's supposed to be good.

2763
02:47:01.380 --> 02:47:06.210
Victus a shitstorm you stirred up for sure.
And uh,
I believe you.

2764
02:47:06.211 --> 02:47:09.360
I believe you're telling the truth and it's a fascinating subject to me.

2765
02:47:09.600 --> 02:47:12.480
It seems like that it's a big charade.

2766
02:47:12.540 --> 02:47:14.780
Especially it seems like with track and field.
I mean not,

2767
02:47:14.790 --> 02:47:18.270
that just seems really kind of like a crazy game mean.

2768
02:47:18.450 --> 02:47:21.660
It's just everybody's doing it and so you have to do it in order to be the best

2769
02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:24.930
to the times with the women athletes.
That's the most telling.

2770
02:47:24.931 --> 02:47:28.500
That's crazy that they can even come close to those because those were more just

2771
02:47:28.501 --> 02:47:31.650
ball and they were just taking crazy roids.
They can't do that anymore.

2772
02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:36.300
They have to be careful now.
Wow.
Fascinating.
Fascinating Shit.
Well listen,

2773

thank you very much for your time.
I really appreciate it.

2774
02:47:39.061 --> 02:47:40.650
People want to get ahold of you on Twitter.

2775
02:47:41.090 --> 02:47:45.270
You could find victor on Twitter under Victor Con C.
O.
N.

Victor Conte on Twitter and a separate website that they can go to to read

2778
02:47:50.731 --> 02:47:54.600
anything.
The snack.com s and a c.com.

2779
02:47:55.140 --> 02:47:59.220
What does that stand for?
Scientific nutrition for advanced conditioning.
Okay,

2780
02:47:59.221 --> 02:48:03.660
and that's your why.
Why conditioning with a k?
No,
it's SNAC.
Oh,

2781
02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:07.920
it's nice snack like sna,
sna.
See,
with no kid myself,

2782
02:48:07.921 --> 02:48:10.710
I wanted it to be stupid and wanted to be like comedy with a k,

2783
02:48:10.711 --> 02:48:13.440
like the comedy writing comedy corner cake cake.

2784
02:48:13.441 --> 02:48:17.490
How many corner they do that in my world,
my world is more silly than your world.

2785
02:48:17.790 --> 02:48:19.950
My world,
if they tested positive for marijuana,

2786
02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:22.560
we would lose half the great comics of the world.
More than than half.

2787
02:48:22.561 --> 02:48:25.370
More than them.
Yeah.
We have a performance enhancing drugs too.

2788
02:48:26.070 --> 02:48:27.000
They're just more subtle.

2789
02:48:27.030 --> 02:48:30.920
You're a very fun and smart guy and I really joined BM here with thank you sir.

2790
02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:32.960
Thank you for coming on.
It was a good,
good conversation.

2791
02:48:32.961 --> 02:48:35.010
It that's very enlightening.
I really enjoyed it.

2792
02:48:35.011 --> 02:48:36.720
Thank you for being so forthcoming and uh,

2793
02:48:36.990 --> 02:48:39.540
I think a lot of people got a lot of information out there.

2794
02:48:39.541 --> 02:48:42.870
Letting light enlightened a lot of peoples to how things really work behind the

2795
02:48:42.871 --> 02:48:44.200
scenes,
especially in track and field.

2796
02:48:44.580 --> 02:48:47.220
An area that I had never had any knowledge about whatsoever.

2797
02:48:47.221 --> 02:48:48.840
And the whole Bosco story.

2798
02:48:48.870 --> 02:48:51.870
It's a fascinating story and I'm glad you're on the straight and narrow,
sir.

2799
02:48:52.080 --> 02:48:53.760
And you're partying with Tommy John,

2800
02:48:53.850 --> 02:48:56.910
Tommy Chong rather in the joint and the joint playing pool.

2801
02:48:57.240 --> 02:49:01.800
Who the fuck fucking ice hockey and shit in the joint kept massages getting

2802
02:49:01.801 --> 02:49:06.750
blown by your fucking CEO.
How crazy is that?
Hot Chicks.
It's hookers.

2803
02:49:07.170 --> 02:49:09.810
Eat Sushi every night.
You can't say,

2804
02:49:09.811 --> 02:49:12.750
can you say what prison it was the Taft prison.

2805
02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:17.340
Go say that 20 miles east of Bakersfield.

2806
02:49:17.420 --> 02:49:21.300
And by the way,
law enforcement officers,
please don't arrest these ladies.

2807
02:49:22.050 --> 02:49:26.490
What's wrong with a little extra money on the side?
Stop Hating.

2808
02:49:26.970 --> 02:49:29.010
Everybody needs to fucking relaxed in this country.

2809
02:49:29.011 --> 02:49:31.800
We've got a bunch of grown adults telling other grown adults what they can and

2810
02:49:31.801 --> 02:49:33.210
can't do.
And some of them,

2811
02:49:33.211 --> 02:49:36.180
they stick them in jails and then the other grown adults blown for money.

2812
02:49:36.450 --> 02:49:40.860
And I have a problem with that.
Victor,
you got a problem with that?
No,
no,
no ways.

2813
02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:43.500
Gentlemen.
There will be no podcast tomorrow folks.

2814
02:49:43.501 --> 02:49:46.170
And they will be none next week either.
Cause next week,
uh,

2815
02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:51.120
I got to go out of town.
Um,
but uh,
we'll be back.
We'll back strong.

2816
02:49:51.360 --> 02:49:54.900
We got a lot of people coming up next month.
One of them is,
uh,

2817
02:49:54.930 --> 02:49:59.010
doctor Peter Duesberg who is the biologist from the University of California,

2818
02:49:59.011 --> 02:50:01.650
Berkeley and he doesn't believe that HIV causes AIDS.

2819
02:50:01.651 --> 02:50:04.950
And this is going to get a really weird,
we should bring aids blended into that

2820
02:50:06.870 --> 02:50:10.980
data.
I don't know.
I,
we have to,

2821
02:50:10.981 --> 02:50:12.240
I know this is a very,

2822
02:50:12.900 --> 02:50:16.830
this is another case where I'm too stupid to really have this conversation with

2823
02:50:16.831 --> 02:50:17.161
this guy,

2824
02:50:17.161 --> 02:50:21.840
so I'm going to have him on and then I am sure there will be people that want to

2825
02:50:21.841 --> 02:50:22.710
provide a rebuttal.

2826
02:50:22.711 --> 02:50:27.711
I will find someone who is actually scientifically able to break down what was

2827
02:50:29.101 --> 02:50:31.080
wrong with mom.
Mr Duesberg said,

2828
02:50:31.260 --> 02:50:34.590
and I will allow the two of them if Mr Duisburg wants to come back to do it

2829
02:50:34.591 --> 02:50:37.540
together.
It's so fascinating.
I'm sorry.
Ah,

2830
02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:40.230
I don't know if doctor Jerkin hang in that you've got to have a,

2831
02:50:40.231 --> 02:50:44.040
like a biologist.
You have to have somebody who understands retroviruses.

2832
02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:47.700
I just made a bunch of noises with my mouth.
I don't even know what they mean.

2833
02:50:48.030 --> 02:50:52.260
That's the problem.
I don't know what the fuck are retro viruses.
It's like older.

2834
02:50:52.261 --> 02:50:56.640
It's like you buy it and use store.
Listen folks and blog and podcast is over.

2835
