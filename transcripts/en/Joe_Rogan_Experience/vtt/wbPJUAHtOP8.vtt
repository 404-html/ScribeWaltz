1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.570
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I was just on the phone with Alex Van Halen and talking to him about we're going</v>

3
00:00:05.711 --> 00:00:09.490
<v Speaker 1>to be playing at the Tokyo Dome work playing at the big arenas.</v>

4
00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:10.480
<v Speaker 1>They're in Japan.</v>

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.820
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to remind him of exactly what you just described that in the United</v>

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.070
<v Speaker 1>States and in Europe you have was like an idling cheer.</v>

8
00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:24.110
<v Speaker 1>A screen that's Ms. Lynch.</v>

9
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.850
<v Speaker 1>It's constant like a car idling.</v>

10
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.613
<v Speaker 1>Idols.</v>

12
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Like a drag racer.</v>

13
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Pluto to be bad,</v>

14
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.450
<v Speaker 1>like you depend on it the way you do your Shpiel,</v>

<v Speaker 1>your punctuation,</v>

17
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.880
<v Speaker 1>you know these delays be eating pudding.</v>

18
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.230
<v Speaker 1>You let them go.</v>

19
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Do you stand now?</v>

20
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Say the next thing that you're going to say.</v>

21
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:47.094
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>so you're listening with that and uh,</v>

24
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>when American just cheer there's,</v>

25
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>it's like a car like,</v>

26
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>well I think it's called blower wine.</v>

27
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.453
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

28
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.550
<v Speaker 1>And it goes for a long time and if you're waiting like to say something next or</v>

29
00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:07.691
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

30
00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:11.270
<v Speaker 1>you're listening for that and you're listening for it to hit a certain point.</v>

31
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Volume wise.</v>

32
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Your duration wise that you interrupt.</v>

33
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

34
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit like a dance you follow up.</v>

35
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

36
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.720
<v Speaker 1>if people are making the long noise,</v>

37
00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:23.770
<v Speaker 1>they enjoy them shops,</v>

38
00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:24.101
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

39
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Let them enjoy themselves.</v>

40
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.640
<v Speaker 1>They love hearing their own power.</v>

41
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.331
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

42
00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:29.920
<v Speaker 1>we are strong or wonderful.</v>

43
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 1>We're young and skinny</v>

44
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.100
<v Speaker 1>is that night in Japan,</v>

45
00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:37.720
<v Speaker 1>you don't get that correct.</v>

46
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.280
<v Speaker 1>You get the Yes,</v>

47
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.403
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

48
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

49
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.320
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like a cheering for the ball,</v>

50
00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:47.890
<v Speaker 1>getting spiked in a volleyball tournament and it's quick,</v>

51
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.120
<v Speaker 1>very quick.</v>

52
00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:50.170
<v Speaker 1>And I had said to Al,</v>

53
00:01:50.171 --> 00:01:51.250
<v Speaker 1>you got to remember,</v>

54
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>think back how fast the cheer is here that we can't depend on that idling screen</v>

55
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

56
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 1>and the comedy show and be weird where we get it laughing like,</v>

57
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.420
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

58
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.680
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

59
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.040
<v Speaker 1>I call it rat pack style,</v>

61
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

62
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.540
<v Speaker 1>it's just where you've made a connection with the audience,</v>

63
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>if pretty much no matter what you say,</v>

64
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.880
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's delivered in the right tone with the right mood is you're a</v>

65
00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:19.520
<v Speaker 1>host,</v>

66
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.880
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

67
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.730
<v Speaker 1>The worst that I can be on stage is a host.</v>

68
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.670
<v Speaker 1>The best is a really funny house.</v>

69
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

70
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Or are really smart house there.</v>

71
00:02:28.821 --> 00:02:29.654
<v Speaker 1>They'd have fun.</v>

72
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.270
<v Speaker 1>You're there to help them.</v>

73
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

74
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.940
<v Speaker 1>So the worst that the least I can do is be a good host.</v>

75
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.760
<v Speaker 1>And that means keep the spirit you have to pay.</v>

76
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

77
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.710
<v Speaker 1>especially if something goes wrong.</v>

78
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.341
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

79
00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:43.630
<v Speaker 1>the plumbing just exploded,</v>

80
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.653
<v Speaker 1>cried,</v>

81
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>then everybody did.</v>

82
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's instantly,</v>

83
00:02:49.571 --> 00:02:49.961
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

84
00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:50.291
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

85
00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:51.220
<v Speaker 1>It's an adventure,</v>

86
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:52.791
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to,</v>

88
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

89
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

90
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.080
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

91
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

92
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.693
<v Speaker 1>That's horrible.</v>

93
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

94
00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:58.594
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

95
00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>I want to be here.</v>

96
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>This isn't fun.</v>

97
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>This is now turning into something other than that's up to the host.</v>

98
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

99
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 1>On a good night.</v>

100
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.610
<v Speaker 1>If you get everybody kind of Holman and bubbling and well fed and watered and</v>

101
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.470
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

103
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>pretty much anything you say can be,</v>

105
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

106
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit funny.</v>

107
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

108
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>And every now and then I hit a moment.</v>

109
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

110
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm just Sammy Davis.</v>

111
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever end up at all when you were done?</v>

112
00:03:29.631 --> 00:03:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Just straight standup?</v>

113
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.311
<v Speaker 1>You ever tried to do that?</v>

114
00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:32.144
<v Speaker 1>Ever have?</v>

115
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

116
00:03:33.351 --> 00:03:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have the,</v>

117
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a dining.</v>

118
00:03:35.331 --> 00:03:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I got the cards for it.</v>

119
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.150
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy because you,</v>

120
00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>you kind of do it a little on stage.</v>

121
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

122
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 1>It's just a tiny bit enough to sneak up and tap the door and run back.</v>

123
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

124
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.180
<v Speaker 1>And then that immediately hit the music.</v>

125
00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

126

128
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I can draw that door anywhere on thin air and go look a song</v>
