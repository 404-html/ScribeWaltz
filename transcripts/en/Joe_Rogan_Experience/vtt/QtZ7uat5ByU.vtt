00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.110

<v Speaker 1>human flip flop.</v>

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.840
<v Speaker 1>You could hide a q tip from where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ankles,</v>

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.290
<v Speaker 1>the calves go into the ankle if you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>just tuck one in there and not even see </v>

5

<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about that too.</v>

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>The thing that you least have a sympathy</v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone who's overweight.</v>

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.200

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

8
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>I sympathize with people who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>glandular problems,</v>

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>but if you're just a fat fuck,</v>

17
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:51.390

<v Speaker 2>And I kind of enjoyed it was different.</v>

18
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel more comfortable with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body too?</v>

19
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 2>Because you look,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was kind of like,</v>

23
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.560
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's skin and boobs everywhere and </v>

24

<v Speaker 2>You ever feel uncomfortable about any </v>

25
00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 2>one of these folds in her stomach?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just weird,</v>

26
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 2>like I don't want to do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was definitely interesting.</v>

27
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Who was it that told us that only fucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a shirt on?</v>

28
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.640

<v Speaker 1>if you were banging.</v>

31
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

32
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're banging,</v>

33
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>it might've been Louie ck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We don't give a fuck.</v>

89
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.480
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know if a girl has big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bushy eyebrows.</v>

90

<v Speaker 1>But she falls in love and you're </v>

97
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.420

<v Speaker 1>I don't think any brand would bother me </v>

98
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.420
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

99
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Hairy legs are tripped up facial hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The girl,</v>

100
00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:15.570
<v Speaker 1>when I was really young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

101
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.620
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

102
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was going to an all girls school.</v>

103
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.110
<v Speaker 1>She's going to an all girls college and </v>
<v Speaker 1>her and her friends wouldn't shave their</v>

104
00:04:22.111 --> 00:04:27.111
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like super feminist hippie </v>

105
00:04:27.111 --> 00:04:27.540
<v Speaker 1>checks and this just did not work out.</v>

106
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.050
<v Speaker 1>The conversations that we had where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

107
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.080
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went to this completely all girl </v>

108
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.380
<v Speaker 1>school that was like super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like super ultra liberal,</v>

109
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.610
<v Speaker 1>ultra socialist ideals and the view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world was very strange and they </v>

110
00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:45.720
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't shave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should women have to shave?</v>

111
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Shave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how about we both shaved?</v>

112
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>If the only way to get you to shave is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I have the shale.</v>

113
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking shave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind having shaved legs.</v>

114
00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll do it if you'll do it.</v>

115
00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>I can't fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hobbit lady.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

117
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:02.510
<v Speaker 1>that's just the trip man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

118
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Girls don't be having here on your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please stop that.</v>

119
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.940
<v Speaker 1>But that's been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this female's shaving has been </v>

120
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.940
<v Speaker 1>going on for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

121
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.470
<v Speaker 1>But what is the reason for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there an evolutionary reason?</v>

122
00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Why are we so much more attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>less hair and why his hair disgusting to</v>

123
00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:20.520
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a hygiene thing for pussy?</v>

124
00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must be a hygiene thing,</v>

125
00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:23.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you got all that crazy here.</v>

126
00:05:23.641 --> 00:05:24.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

127
00:05:24.441 --> 00:05:25.890
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know what the fuck is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

128
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.350
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what's cleaner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Visual creatures too.</v>

129
00:05:28.351 --> 00:05:31.290
<v Speaker 1>So at the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some guys like hairy pussies,</v>

130
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.270
<v Speaker 2>hairy pussies on the comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Harry is very 2010,</v>

131
00:05:35.271 --> 00:05:37.340
<v Speaker 2>so Ayesha Gray and some of these girls </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>

132
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.630
<v Speaker 2>they're rocking it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got the bus,</v>

133
00:05:38.631 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 2>but they cut it off right at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

134
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean they don't go all the way through</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the.</v>

135
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.780
<v Speaker 1>So the little top Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't hair butthole Bush go.</v>

136
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do they do?</v>

137
00:05:49.311 --> 00:05:54.311
<v Speaker 1>They wax around all that laser and laser</v>
<v Speaker 1>just keep a landing patch or tweezed </v>

138
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>whole triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that</v>

139
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 3>like a defiance thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm going to redefine my sexuality.</v>

140
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just that people get so </v>
<v Speaker 3>accustomed.</v>

141
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 3>The one thing that the new is hot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably it'll go in 10 years.</v>

142
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 3>So gray fascinates me</v>

143
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.380
<v Speaker 1>and one of the reasons why she </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinates me is because she's like the </v>

144
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.710
<v Speaker 1>girl that like somehow or another is I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>free of the porn and more into moral </v>

145
00:06:19.501 --> 00:06:23.140
<v Speaker 1>like of mainstream [inaudible] people's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>people's thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

147
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Like she's not just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

148
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.780
<v Speaker 1>she's like elevated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's left the just the total porn </v>

149
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.710
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's permeated regular pop culture.</v>

150
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.120
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's strange when something like </v>

151
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.120
<v Speaker 1>that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how does one do that?</v>

152
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always like,</v>

153
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.040
<v Speaker 1>there's people that are like super </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful at something like Lance </v>

154
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

155
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 1>there's the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy rides the bike,</v>

156
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Jenna Jameson,</v>

157
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Speaker 1>there's the super porn star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:53.981
<v Speaker 1>she's the one and then there was a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>that get through the traci lords that </v>

159
00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 1>get through and then other people know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about them,</v>

160
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Sasha gray is one,</v>

161
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.610
<v Speaker 1>she's a unique one.</v>

162
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.690
<v Speaker 3>She is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's interesting because she's on </v>

163
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.690
<v Speaker 3>the very hardcore side of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

164
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.290
<v Speaker 3>of the business too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she's no holds barred.</v>

165
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

166
00:07:06.401 --> 00:07:11.401
<v Speaker 3>whatever she's down with and she.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she kinda does it in a way where </v>

167
00:07:11.401 --> 00:07:14.671
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to explore all of the sides of </v>

168
00:07:14.671 --> 00:07:14.800
<v Speaker 3>sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the dark side.</v>

169
00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:17.230
<v Speaker 3>So she kinda has owned it from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning.</v>

170
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.360
<v Speaker 3>I think at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's made it better.</v>

171
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.280
<v Speaker 3>You don't feel like Sasha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

172
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.440
<v Speaker 3>our poor Sasha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like Sasha was doing what she wants </v>

173
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.020
<v Speaker 3>to do and she's doing it on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that I think has helped her out a lot</v>

174
00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:31.080
<v Speaker 3>and then she got a big break with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

175
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Steven Soderbergh film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that as,</v>

176
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.690
<v Speaker 3>as a little tough to watch the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>

177
00:07:37.691 --> 00:07:38.690
<v Speaker 3>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was cool.</v>

178
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.720
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

179
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.430
<v Speaker 3>I would have liked it as a short movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

180
00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:43.530
<v Speaker 3>like she reluctant to say it.</v>

181
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.020
<v Speaker 3>So I do know Sasha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

182
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.030
<v Speaker 3>some of these girls will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was an awesome actor,</v>

183
00:07:49.031 --> 00:07:52.060
<v Speaker 3>will look what you had to work with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it was a cool feeling,</v>

184
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't drag that on for an hour </v>

185
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.120
<v Speaker 3>and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what's the cool feeling?</v>

186
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.231
<v Speaker 3>What is the movie about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of this very dark kind of </v>

187
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:01.231
<v Speaker 3>artistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

188
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.460
<v Speaker 3>analysis of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a call girl,</v>

189
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how that interaction is.</v>

190
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.630
<v Speaker 3>But it could have been done with one </v>
<v Speaker 3>scene.</v>

191
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Like you get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get,</v>

192
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.940
<v Speaker 3>you get the feeling you get how this </v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction goes.</v>

193
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.980
<v Speaker 3>So in the girlfriend experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is she providing like an intimate call </v>

194
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:18.250
<v Speaker 3>girl experience that it's like having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend?</v>

195
00:08:18.251 --> 00:08:19.340
<v Speaker 3>Is that promises?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

196
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.270
<v Speaker 3>I saw like two minutes of it once on </v>
<v Speaker 3>television about right.</v>

197
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.640
<v Speaker 3>Really minutes was the last to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy and hugging him and then they </v>

198
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.390
<v Speaker 3>cut the black and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is that?</v>

199
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.940
<v Speaker 3>Just kind of a snippet that lasts a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit too long.</v>

200
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.920
<v Speaker 3>That's a fucking strange thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

201
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.660
<v Speaker 3>You ever have a buddy that's in love </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a prostitute?</v>

202
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.090
<v Speaker 3>I've had guys fall in love with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>stripper.</v>

203
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:42.280
<v Speaker 3>The t pains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

204
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.260
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend who was in love with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>prostitute.</v>

205
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.470
<v Speaker 3>He was a guy used to play pool with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very nice guy,</v>

206
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.970
<v Speaker 3>but he was unfortunate looking and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did not do very well with the ladies</v>

207
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.690
<v Speaker 1>and he would go to this massage parlor </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get jerked off by this one and a,</v>

208
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.940
<v Speaker 1>it was like one of those creepy massage </v>
<v Speaker 1>parlors,</v>

209
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:04.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it wasn't really a massage parlor </v>

210
00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:04.941
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

211
00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:04.941
<v Speaker 1>they like rub your back and then just </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

212
00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:05.190
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull your Dick out,</v>

213
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:06.730
<v Speaker 1>let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

214
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.840
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to ask her out to dinner </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside and she wouldn't go out with </v>

215
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.171
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was trying to figure out like </v>

216
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:16.171
<v Speaker 1>he's asking me what I should do at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>magic words are,</v>

217
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:18.240
<v Speaker 1>what should I do to get her to come out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me?</v>

218
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 1>I really would like to see her outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the club.</v>

219
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

220
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:27.530
<v Speaker 1>you're on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the threads like that,</v>

221
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.140
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things wrong with what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to do.</v>

222
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

223
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

224
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.540
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens then?</v>

225
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:38.740
<v Speaker 1>You become boyfriend and girlfriend and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she agrees,</v>

226
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.480
<v Speaker 1>looks and no more in the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only hand jobs from now on.</v>

227
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 1>Like do you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you come to an agreement or just </v>

228
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 1>accept the fact that this is what she </v>
<v Speaker 1>does at work?</v>

229
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 1>That's work for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tough.</v>

230
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

231
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.430
<v Speaker 1>It's strange that we're so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so genetically attached.</v>

232
00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:58.540
<v Speaker 1>We're so genetically attached to control</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

233
00:09:58.541 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

234
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:05.330
<v Speaker 1>you could have a wife that was a massage</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapist and she could be a great deep </v>

235
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:05.520
<v Speaker 1>tissues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll let her,</v>

236
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:07.400
<v Speaker 1>let her rub your Bob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

237
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.260
<v Speaker 1>your wife's going to rub me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She could've rubbed me with oil all over</v>

238
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:15.261
<v Speaker 1>my back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And am I going to grown while she's </v>

239
00:10:15.261 --> 00:10:15.261
<v Speaker 1>rubbing me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go,</v>

240
00:10:15.261 --> 00:10:15.530
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

241
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.880
<v Speaker 1>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to be cool with that.</v>

242
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay because it's just rubbing your</v>

243
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:25.041
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if she rubs your Dick and you make </v>

244
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:25.041
<v Speaker 1>those same noises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

245
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.460
<v Speaker 1>basically she's doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just massaging you,</v>

246
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 1>but it just feels way better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it feels too good.</v>

247
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much.</v>

248
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to her rubbing on your deck.</v>

249
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.600
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We draw the line.</v>

250
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.360
<v Speaker 3>It's a funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a funny paradigm and it's certainly</v>

251
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.960
<v Speaker 3>always been one sided.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

252
00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.150
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even want to check who does </v>
<v Speaker 1>massages.</v>

253
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would feel creeped out.</v>

254
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.700
<v Speaker 1>I get a bunch of my buddies come over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

255
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:47.770
<v Speaker 1>and massage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

256
00:10:47.771 --> 00:10:51.050
<v Speaker 1>what could you imagine if you had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>check that was doing massages and you're</v>

257
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:56.070
<v Speaker 1>really into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one of your buddies started </v>

258
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:56.070
<v Speaker 1>getting massages from her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

259
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:56.070

261
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.830

<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for the big tip.</v>

262
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the best.</v>

263
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the best.</v>

<v Speaker 1>When's the next one?</v>

266
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.730
<v Speaker 1>When we doing this again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Goddammit,</v>

269
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:20.350
<v Speaker 1>you're causing pleasure with your hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rubbing his ass cheeks.</v>

270
00:11:20.351 --> 00:11:22.180
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>

271
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:28.900
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because you have those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those conversations like would you tell </v>

272
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.600
<v Speaker 1>me if mark got a hard on while you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>massaged them?</v>

273
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.180
<v Speaker 1>What are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop it.</v>

274
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

275
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.970
<v Speaker 3>There's a real distinction for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

276
00:11:37.971 --> 00:11:41.810
<v Speaker 3>and there's some people who won't let </v>
<v Speaker 3>their girls get a massage like I have.</v>

277
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

278
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:48.070
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They won't let them get a massage from </v>

279
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:48.130
<v Speaker 3>another male Zeus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

280
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.570
<v Speaker 3>and that's some Taliban type shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

281
00:11:50.571 --> 00:11:53.620
<v Speaker 3>and then it just as a whole variety of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>

282
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different levels of what people are </v>

283
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:58.710
<v Speaker 3>comfortable with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

284
00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.690
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking seen you naked and robin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

285
00:12:01.891 --> 00:12:03.710
<v Speaker 3>it's good to look at your booth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

286
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.650
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

287
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:07.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting paradigm.</v>

288
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

289
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.830
<v Speaker 3>I think I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>

290
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and my girl have a very,</v>

291
00:12:12.461 --> 00:12:14.170
<v Speaker 3>like very open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honest,</v>

292
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship and she killed him.</v>

293
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:19.240
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't respect,</v>

294
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.890
<v Speaker 3>we respect each other's ability to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to go out and experience things.</v>

295
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:28.900
<v Speaker 3>But Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marcus's Tampax is brought to you by the</v>

296
00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:31.110
<v Speaker 3>fleshlight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please continue with it.</v>

297
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 3>But there would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

298
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.030
<v Speaker 3>there's a real hard line between like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

299
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Like I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

300
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:42.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally cool with her getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>massaged and even in like some perfect </v>

301
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.771
<v Speaker 3>circumstance where there was some unit </v>
<v Speaker 3>who needed to manually get her off at </v>

302
00:12:46.771 --> 00:12:48.370
<v Speaker 3>some point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I would be cool with that.</v>

303
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:50.310
<v Speaker 3>But at no point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you know,</v>

304
00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:51.730
<v Speaker 3>whatever they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't exist anymore,</v>

305
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.570
<v Speaker 1>be cool with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do they still exist?</v>

306
00:12:54.571 --> 00:12:55.800
<v Speaker 1>They should chop your balls off.</v>

307
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.540
<v Speaker 3>Some situation where it was very </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanical.</v>

308
00:12:58.541 --> 00:13:01.160
<v Speaker 3>She goes in for a service he </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanically gets right.</v>

309
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.990
<v Speaker 3>But at the point where it's like he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>lusting and she's lost a mare.</v>

310
00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:06.820
<v Speaker 3>That's when the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when the board,</v>

311
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:11.290
<v Speaker 3>that's where the fucking hard line is </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bloomberg at about it.</v>

312
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:13.580
<v Speaker 3>And they'll last just physical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

313
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.280
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's for me.</v>

314
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.520
<v Speaker 3>I can make the connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same as rubbing the back or </v>

315
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.070
<v Speaker 3>doing something like that is the same as</v>
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

316
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.490
<v Speaker 1>to jerk off salon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go there.</v>

317
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Just some girl just rubs your balls that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot oil and jerks you off and that's it.</v>

318
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing was going on.</v>

319
00:13:30.731 --> 00:13:33.410
<v Speaker 1>She kind of fairly mechanical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

320
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:34.670
<v Speaker 1>That was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was awesome.</v>

321
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:39.730
<v Speaker 1>I got rid of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not like you go out and talk about your </v>

322
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:40.820
<v Speaker 1>childhood and I don't even know my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

323
00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know my dad either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where they've seen.</v>

324
00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:49.191
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hands laying in the field looking </v>

325
00:13:49.191 --> 00:13:49.191
<v Speaker 1>up at the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck all that,</v>

326
00:13:49.191 --> 00:13:50.420
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just bullshit.</v>

327
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:58.220
<v Speaker 1>They're good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real question is going to be what </v>

328
00:14:00.081 --> 00:14:05.081
<v Speaker 1>happens when we create artificial people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fuck them and are people even going </v>

329
00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:06.560
<v Speaker 1>to bother with relationships?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real question.</v>

330
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.800
<v Speaker 1>You are on the brink of this with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>flashlight thing because now you guys </v>

331
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.240
<v Speaker 1>are the first people that have created </v>
<v Speaker 1>an effective artificial vagina.</v>

332
00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.570
<v Speaker 1>All those other ones are bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those blow up dolls.</v>

333
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.310
<v Speaker 1>Those are for Bachelor Party gag gift </v>
<v Speaker 1>bags.</v>

334
00:14:20.311 --> 00:14:21.260
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are silly.</v>

335
00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Nobody really fucks blow up dolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do,</v>

336
00:14:23.331 --> 00:14:24.920
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're better off jerking off.</v>

337
00:14:24.921 --> 00:14:27.110
<v Speaker 1>You might fuck one once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not good.</v>

338
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys have engineered a true </v>

339
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:32.570
<v Speaker 1>artificial vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is just step one.</v>

340
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Remember when tvs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go over your grandfather's </v>

341
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.911
<v Speaker 1>house and the TV was this big giant ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking cabinet and the TV itself was </v>

342
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:44.411
<v Speaker 1>only like 11 inches across and you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking monstrous piece of </v>

343
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:47.650
<v Speaker 1>furniture with tubes and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bag of wires and memory,</v>

344
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.990
<v Speaker 1>sometimes sparks would come out the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd have to open up that there was</v>

345
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:56.110
<v Speaker 1>a particle board back to it and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>unscrew it and pull it back and look </v>

346
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:59.570
<v Speaker 1>inside the bowels of this fucking beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now look at it.</v>

347
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:02.570
<v Speaker 1>You can watch your little iphone slips </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your pocket,</v>

348
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.730
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's way higher resolution.</v>

349
00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:09.731
<v Speaker 1>So much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much better experience watching a movie </v>

350
00:15:09.731 --> 00:15:11.690
<v Speaker 1>on your iphone than it is one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid tvs or an I pad.</v>

351
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

352
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.710
<v Speaker 1>the ipad of the fake pussies coming.</v>

353
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:17.440
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

354
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:18.760
<v Speaker 3>hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flashlight will be the ones.</v>

355
00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:24.050
<v Speaker 3>Do you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So are you guys working with genetic </v>

356
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.050
<v Speaker 3>engineers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you on the cusp of nanotechnology?</v>

357
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

358
00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.050
<v Speaker 3>All of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of.</v>

359
00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:26.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a golden goose.</v>

360
00:15:26.811 --> 00:15:29.690
<v Speaker 3>Like the more realistic you can get it </v>
<v Speaker 3>interactive,</v>

361
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:34.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fully people have tried to do it </v>

362
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:34.720
<v Speaker 3>but no one's done it well yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So obviously we're looking into it.</v>

363
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.251
<v Speaker 3>I mean things have to evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a flashlight looking into </v>

364
00:15:39.251 --> 00:15:39.251
<v Speaker 3>robotics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

365
00:15:39.251 --> 00:15:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Well to a certain one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robotics just said just leave it.</v>

366
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't want to get too much into</v>

367
00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:50.541
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we've certainly explored all those </v>

368
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:50.541
<v Speaker 3>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even making it so that they can register</v>

369
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:52.050
<v Speaker 3>your performance so you could almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

370
00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:57.051
<v Speaker 3>log in and see your performance is </v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to somebody else on your </v>

371
00:15:57.051 --> 00:16:00.410
<v Speaker 3>machine courts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you register?</v>

372
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.640
<v Speaker 3>You have high scores like high score.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are devaluing the personal </v>

373
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.780
<v Speaker 3>experience too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're taking it too far,</v>

374
00:16:06.781 --> 00:16:11.781
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two thousand strokes shouldn't be like </v>

375
00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:11.781
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

376
00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:12.750
<v Speaker 3>you're not fucking a person who is </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to make feel good.</v>

377
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.640
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to shoot him</v>

378
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.030
<v Speaker 1>load.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

379
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.400
<v Speaker 1>if I do this 10 times that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it taking so long?</v>

380
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should have,</v>

381
00:16:20.261 --> 00:16:23.860
<v Speaker 2>you should have like fleshlight pants </v>
<v Speaker 2>for gay guys that like the,</v>

382
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.260
<v Speaker 2>there's like a thing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The end of the fleshlight.</v>

383
00:16:26.261 --> 00:16:28.200
<v Speaker 2>So it goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're assholes.</v>

384
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.630
<v Speaker 2>When other guys fuck the other guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels better.</v>

385
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>

386
00:16:32.251 --> 00:16:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Like it feels like a pussy adapter for </v>
<v Speaker 2>another guy's asshole.</v>

387
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.110
<v Speaker 3>How do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't like the feeling of guys.</v>

388
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:37.990
<v Speaker 3>Assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

389
00:16:37.991 --> 00:16:42.991
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying mix it up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They only have one type dude is fucking </v>

390
00:16:42.991 --> 00:16:43.450
<v Speaker 3>you in the buddy's fucking you in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>butt.</v>

391
00:16:43.451 --> 00:16:45.910
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is kind of a filter for that.</v>

392
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.300
<v Speaker 3>Something rather disturbing is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually happened except uh,</v>

393
00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.710
<v Speaker 3>the guy just put the fleshlight straight</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his butt.</v>

394
00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see that.</v>

395
00:16:56.931 --> 00:17:00.610
<v Speaker 3>But our flesh Jack team informed me </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a video.</v>

396
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:05.660
<v Speaker 3>This video is a video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys stuffed the flashlight up his </v>

397
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.100
<v Speaker 3>button and another guy fucked the flush </v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

398
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.090
<v Speaker 3>Would that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would that make you gay?</v>

399
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:13.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure about that if you do fish </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the but it's gay.</v>

400
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you.</v>

401
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying if a guy fucks you,</v>

402
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.550
<v Speaker 3>your flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

403
00:17:19.551 --> 00:17:22.070
<v Speaker 3>See if you stuck a flashlight up your </v>
<v Speaker 3>ass that's gay.</v>

404
00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Or if the guy fucks your flashlight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's touching.</v>

405
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Is he getting at what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you just fucking a rubber vagina?</v>

406
00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:31.040
<v Speaker 3>It's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're somehow touching a guy getting</v>

407
00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.360
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if you don't touch them?</v>

408
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.920
<v Speaker 3>What if you just assume like a high </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain guide?</v>

409
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Spread your legs apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He keeps his legs closed.</v>

410
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:44.480
<v Speaker 3>Want me to say no for a reason was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>queer queer?</v>

411
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.450
<v Speaker 3>That would be weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

412
00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:56.451
<v Speaker 3>one of our most popular selling units,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called the stamina training unit </v>

413
00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:57.300
<v Speaker 3>though this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

414
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.120
<v Speaker 3>the concept is basically that your hand </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't feel anything like posting,</v>

415
00:18:01.121 --> 00:18:04.560
<v Speaker 3>so it doesn't prepare you to have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of anxiety,</v>

416
00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:09.561
<v Speaker 3>performance anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who don't last long enough to </v>

417
00:18:09.561 --> 00:18:09.561
<v Speaker 3>last longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

418
00:18:09.561 --> 00:18:14.150
<v Speaker 3>we've been able to give them a product </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very like highly sensitive inner </v>

419
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.050
<v Speaker 3>canal so they can use it and get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit more prepared.</v>

420
00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:18.810
<v Speaker 3>And sensitize the people love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we get feedback like,</v>

421
00:18:18.811 --> 00:18:20.490
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you so much.</v>

422
00:18:20.491 --> 00:18:21.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

423
00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:23.760
<v Speaker 3>I've always had problems with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now I've gotten a lot better.</v>

424
00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time you actually stick your </v>

425
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:28.900
<v Speaker 1>dick inside a vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

426
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.220
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time I had sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came in one second.</v>

427
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.790
<v Speaker 1>I came in one second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stuck at it.</v>

428
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.580
<v Speaker 1>I pulled it out and there was just loads</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

429
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I barely made it.</v>

430
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Barely made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have no idea what that's going to feel </v>

431
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.181
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time I blew a load I was in </v>

432
00:18:46.181 --> 00:18:46.550
<v Speaker 1>shock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know that I wasn't.</v>

433
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Nobody told me Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

434
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents didn't tell me anything.</v>

435
00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.780
<v Speaker 1>And when I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was like 14 or 15,</v>

436
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.960
<v Speaker 1>15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My girlfriend blooming and I busted one </v>

437
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.680
<v Speaker 1>in her mouth and my ears rang and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

438
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.050
<v Speaker 1>what the hell was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

439
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.510
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like stuff comes out of you.</v>

440
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Like you could feel it come on.</v>

441
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.520
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

442
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I've been building up to it.</v>

443
00:19:09.651 --> 00:19:14.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that there was even an </v>

444
00:19:14.651 --> 00:19:16.511
<v Speaker 1>orgasm thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recall it being like a 32nd or </v>

445
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:21.830
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A ridiculous amount that's fucking ears </v>

446
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:22.520
<v Speaker 1>rang for the first time I came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ears rang.</v>

447
00:19:22.521 --> 00:19:24.110
<v Speaker 1>They haven't ranked sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

448
00:19:24.111 --> 00:19:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Because I never gave myself a day one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day off since.</v>

449
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did one time for my website.</v>

450
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:36.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like 30 days or something like </v>

451
00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.040
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to do.</v>

452
00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.040
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

453
00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.040
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

454
00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.510
<v Speaker 1>you never recaptured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they say with heroin addicts </v>

455
00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.020
<v Speaker 1>the first time they shoot heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just insanely beautiful experience.</v>

456
00:19:42.021 --> 00:19:44.180
<v Speaker 1>And from then on you're chasing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dragon Dragon here.</v>

457
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that expression?</v>

458
00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

459
00:19:46.461 --> 00:19:49.070
<v Speaker 1>The first load you blow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like it's good as it gets.</v>

460
00:19:49.071 --> 00:19:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Kids love it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it.</v>

461
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.130
<v Speaker 1>But the experience is so rough that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

462
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just nervous.</v>

463
00:19:56.611 --> 00:19:57.440
<v Speaker 3>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

464
00:19:57.441 --> 00:20:02.441
<v Speaker 3>I remember the first time I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to use this condom and </v>

465
00:20:02.441 --> 00:20:02.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm going into the bathroom and I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

466
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:03.850
<v Speaker 3>it's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

467
00:20:03.851 --> 00:20:08.851
<v Speaker 3>And she's in the bed and she's ready and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like literally like the face was </v>

468
00:20:08.851 --> 00:20:10.320
<v Speaker 3>hot and I just came out and just gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

469
00:20:10.321 --> 00:20:11.250
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

470
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.130
<v Speaker 3>We got to come up with a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>paradigm to make this happen.</v>

471
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

472
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:16.770
<v Speaker 3>and eventually you figure it out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

473
00:20:16.771 --> 00:20:19.400
<v Speaker 3>But that first time is fucking brutal to</v>

474
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:25.180
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about these fighters </v>

475
00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:25.490
<v Speaker 1>that hold off for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

476
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:30.590
<v Speaker 1>They're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're distracting the shit out of </v>

477
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.590
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

478
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.590
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a really bad at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so silly.</v>

479
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No writing,</v>

480
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.770
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no tests,</v>

481
00:20:34.771 --> 00:20:39.771
<v Speaker 1>no studies done ever that show a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decrease in performance due to the fact </v>

482
00:20:39.771 --> 00:20:44.151
<v Speaker 1>that you're having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the distraction that you would </v>

483
00:20:44.151 --> 00:20:45.360
<v Speaker 1>get from not having sex would be way </v>
<v Speaker 1>more problematic.</v>

484
00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 1>That would fuck you up more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will up your train of thought.</v>

485
00:20:48.071 --> 00:20:53.071
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't want to fight you on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get some pussy fucking late when he got </v>

486
00:20:53.071 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 1>laid in eight weeks when going through </v>
<v Speaker 1>training camp.</v>

487
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.510
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seemed.</v>

488
00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.520
<v Speaker 1>They seemed to say that it builds </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression that they just want to </v>

489
00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.890
<v Speaker 1>conquer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it does,</v>

490
00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:07.891
<v Speaker 1>but just aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you need a fucking professional cage </v>

491
00:21:08.441 --> 00:21:09.130
<v Speaker 1>fighter already?</v>

492
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Chances are you're aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

493
00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.030
<v Speaker 1>you really need to be more fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>under a better ground game though,</v>

494
00:21:16.031 --> 00:21:21.031
<v Speaker 1>because they always want to get on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground who used to fight and he used to </v>

495
00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:24.040
<v Speaker 1>fuck right before he fought Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should be the end of discussion.</v>

496
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

497
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.130
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand from sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>intercourse.</v>

498
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:32.131
<v Speaker 1>It just is a natural feeling for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just had to make sure I was relaxed </v>

499
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:37.320
<v Speaker 1>before my big fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those all tyson training videos are </v>

500
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:37.320
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The passwords,</v>

501
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.090
<v Speaker 1>his early fights man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Marvis frazier,</v>

502
00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.750
<v Speaker 1>you're wanting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tamara was frazier fight.</v>

503
00:21:40.751 --> 00:21:45.751
<v Speaker 1>That was a salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just ran up to that regular dude and </v>

504
00:21:45.751 --> 00:21:45.751
<v Speaker 1>beat the fuck out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

505
00:21:45.751 --> 00:21:49.330
<v Speaker 1>His Super Alpha body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit didn't even make any sense.</v>

506
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:54.450
<v Speaker 1>He came out of nowhere and got everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>excited about fighting again for the </v>

507
00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.410
<v Speaker 1>longest time after Mohammed Ali.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gave a fuck about boxing.</v>

508
00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Larry Holmes era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like,</v>

509
00:21:58.571 --> 00:22:03.571
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Larry Holmes was fighting pink </v>

510
00:22:03.571 --> 00:22:03.571

<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if they ever fought,</v>

511
00:22:03.571 --> 00:22:04.570
<v Speaker 1>but you know my point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

512
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:05.650
<v Speaker 1>who gives a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

514
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Michael Dokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

515
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:13.770
<v Speaker 1>You know that all of a sudden this crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker moving 100 times faster </v>

516
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:17.320
<v Speaker 1>than everybody else and just smashing </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the face at will.</v>

517
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 1>That's what we wanted to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't want to see that.</v>

518
00:22:19.781 --> 00:22:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Those fights were fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to see us salts two minutes.</v>

519
00:22:24.311 --> 00:22:25.210
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was worth it.</v>

520
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Not really though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get pissed off.</v>

521
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.930
<v Speaker 1>You have a bunch of friends over for </v>
<v Speaker 1>review because nobody gives a fuck about</v>

522
00:22:31.931 --> 00:22:34.330
<v Speaker 1>the prelims and boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the beautiful things about</v>

523
00:22:34.331 --> 00:22:36.520
<v Speaker 1>the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got a UFC card.</v>

524
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:41.730
<v Speaker 1>You're not just getting the main event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting a fuck load of other </v>

525
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:42.330
<v Speaker 1>flights and they're all well matched and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all people you give a shit about</v>

526
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:42.750
<v Speaker 1>are all.</v>

527
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:47.760
<v Speaker 1>They're all exciting fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones that actually make </v>

528
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:47.760
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bunch of shit to watch.</v>

529
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.110
<v Speaker 1>So if the end fight is only like 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds,</v>

530
00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Anderson Silva and you know James </v>

531
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Irvin or something like Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

532
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:55.950
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel ripped off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

533
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.960
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw a lot of shit before we saw those</v>

534
00:22:58.961 --> 00:22:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Tyson fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

535
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I'd have friends saying I ain't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought.</v>

536
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.770
<v Speaker 1>The last one was 34 could circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

537
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's kind of an epic moment.</v>

538
00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.850
<v Speaker 1>The one I missed was the one where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost a.</v>

539
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I saw because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who fucking beat the shit out of this </v>

540
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:19.621
<v Speaker 1>guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buster Douglas was like 60 to one </v>

541
00:23:19.621 --> 00:23:19.621
<v Speaker 1>underdog or something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

542
00:23:19.621 --> 00:23:20.560
<v Speaker 1>What was the other?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was something Nutty,</v>

543
00:23:20.561 --> 00:23:22.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like 31 or something.</v>

544
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.930
<v Speaker 1>You got the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I remember I watched it,</v>

545
00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I watched the tape and I was convinced </v>
<v Speaker 1>whilst watching the tape that he was </v>

546
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:31.050
<v Speaker 1>going to win.</v>

547
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyson's going to win this.</v>

548
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he's gonna win.</v>

549
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I know he got knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was watching a fucking replay of </v>

550
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.050
<v Speaker 1>it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going to win this.</v>

551
00:23:38.051 --> 00:23:43.051
<v Speaker 1>I know he's got a big fucking joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

552
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.190
<v Speaker 1>You can't be losing ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't lose.</v>

553
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.400
<v Speaker 1>It's important that when you're a kid to</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that there are human beings,</v>

554
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:54.670
<v Speaker 1>that everyone's just a human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a few people that just </v>

555
00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:54.710
<v Speaker 1>pass that human being marked in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

556
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:57.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Mike Tyson or meeting somebody,</v>

557
00:23:57.591 --> 00:24:00.620
<v Speaker 1>meeting some famous dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met ace freely when I was a little kid</v>

558
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.590
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden he was just as dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>kiss for people don't know.</v>

560

<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my uncle used to work in an advertising </v>

<v Speaker 1>a sudden this dude walks in and it's ace</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I was a huge kiss fan and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even have makeup on.</v>

565
00:24:16.821 --> 00:24:18.260
<v Speaker 1>This is back when kiss wore makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

566
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.020

<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe that dude was right </v>

568
00:24:26.021 --> 00:24:27.140

<v Speaker 1>that people think that way about.</v>

572
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I met Kenny loggins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty cool.</v>

573
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.330

<v Speaker 1>always use.</v>

593
00:25:32.091 --> 00:25:34.580

594
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.520

<v Speaker 1>Why is it that it was the amount?</v>

595
00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the emasculation that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented.</v>

596
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:46.630
<v Speaker 1>He represents dudes married to women.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I like a sport jacket and he got your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking sport.</v>

608
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what raised the ire and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating shit.</v>

609
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:14.570
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of the show.</v>

610
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.960
<v Speaker 1>That was the romantic ending it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenny G.</v>

611
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.110
<v Speaker 1>before we go July,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought a gift for a.</v>

612
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you got Brian here?</v>

613
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.110
<v Speaker 1>What do you got?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

614
00:26:24.111 --> 00:26:24.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

615
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:30.010
<v Speaker 1>people kind of overlook a lot of very </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal and very cool substances that are </v>

616
00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:30.940
<v Speaker 1>available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

617
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.230
<v Speaker 1>so I brought you guys some Blue Lotus </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil.</v>

618
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

619
00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:39.161
<v Speaker 1>Lotus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lotus oil was historically prize from </v>

620
00:26:39.161 --> 00:26:42.021
<v Speaker 1>the land of the Lotus eaters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of gives you this euphoric feeling </v>

621
00:26:42.021 --> 00:26:42.950
<v Speaker 1>and it's existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Hindu art work,</v>

622
00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 1>the lotus flower.</v>

623
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually,</v>

624
00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:48.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite they taste like a ton of lotus oil</v>

625
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.720
<v Speaker 1>to make this one little vial here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This might be,</v>

626
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.210
<v Speaker 1>it might be loud as I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

627
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

628
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.620
<v Speaker 1>So it's a little vial here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me open this up here.</v>

629
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.220
<v Speaker 1>That did extract like out of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>and thousands and thousands of loads.</v>

630
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.940
<v Speaker 1>It's an actual ton of pedals to make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pedals 2000 pounds to make that little </v>

631
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.940
<v Speaker 1>vial and you make a little of that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

632
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.490
<v Speaker 1>So then they make this vow is to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

633
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:19.491
<v Speaker 1>he dropped it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be an issue.</v>

634
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:26.490
<v Speaker 1>So a large is 2000 pedals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must be 2000 pounds.</v>

635
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I mean 2000 pound believable.</v>

636
00:27:28.521 --> 00:27:33.521
<v Speaker 3>So it makes it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an ounce of the oil and what does </v>

637
00:27:33.521 --> 00:27:36.500
<v Speaker 3>it look like in a room like this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

638
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:39.030
<v Speaker 3>So it was very pricey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I took that,</v>

639
00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.770
<v Speaker 3>I actually review it on my blog where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you pull it down to us and you can check</v>

640
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.100
<v Speaker 3>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I took it.</v>

641
00:27:46.101 --> 00:27:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you had a third one?</v>

642
00:27:48.311 --> 00:27:50.300
<v Speaker 3>But you've had about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had about a half of a mile.</v>

643
00:27:50.301 --> 00:27:55.301
<v Speaker 3>It kind of comes out tufts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I gave it a stiff shake because that </v>

644
00:27:55.301 --> 00:27:55.301
<v Speaker 3>what you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

645
00:27:55.301 --> 00:27:55.640
<v Speaker 3>This was full and there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

646
00:27:55.641 --> 00:27:56.990
<v Speaker 3>this is brand new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is brand new.</v>

647
00:27:56.991 --> 00:27:58.250
<v Speaker 3>It's brand new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is how it comes.</v>

648
00:27:58.251 --> 00:28:01.010
<v Speaker 3>It comes out for took maybe maybe about </v>
<v Speaker 3>half of that,</v>

649
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.730
<v Speaker 3>maybe took about half of that and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty Rad.</v>

650
00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.920
<v Speaker 3>You feel you feel very euphoric and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

651
00:28:07.921 --> 00:28:09.170
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

652
00:28:09.171 --> 00:28:12.620
<v Speaker 3>all your sensations feel good and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not overpowering.</v>

653
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.110
<v Speaker 3>It's not something that like takes you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and hit you with a hammer.</v>

654
00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.540
<v Speaker 3>But when you say I love you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your girlfriend,</v>

657
00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.810

<v Speaker 3>but it's like you really feel it.</v>

658
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.970
