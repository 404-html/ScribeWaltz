00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.570
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>And we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

4
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Gary Hydro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for coming man.</v>

5
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My pleasure.</v>

6
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.420
<v Speaker 1>The case against sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.750
<v Speaker 1>This is a for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a up.</v>

8
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to put this any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

9
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.520
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've kind of consumed sugar most of my </v>

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.731
<v Speaker 1>life until the last couple of years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I slowly sort of tapered off and about </v>

11
00:00:28.731 --> 00:00:30.810
<v Speaker 1>about a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe last February or so.</v>

12
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I just pretty much cut it all out except</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the occasional occasional dessert </v>

13
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.911
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're infinitely better quality of </v>

14
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:40.911
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel much better.</v>

15
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:45.680
<v Speaker 1>I have more energy and then I started </v>
<v Speaker 1>really getting into it and then I came </v>

16
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>across your work and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I want to know is first of all,</v>

17
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>how did you get involved in this and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much resistance have you fixed?</v>

18
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This being the sugarcane,</v>

19
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>this being the whole obesity diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition,</v>

20
00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:02.841
<v Speaker 1>we can get into all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the sugar one to me is absolutely </v>

21
00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>fascinating when you go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

22
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>if you've seen that sugar movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

23
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably in it I think.</v>

24
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I think you ought to come onto the </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking cereal boxes.</v>

25
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

26
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched it with my kids.</v>

28
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made my kids watch it and it's amazing</v>

29
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>a six year old watches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

31
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:21.690
<v Speaker 1>And then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is sugar in everything?</v>

32
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny because my kids lived with </v>

33
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 2>this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

34
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.090
<v Speaker 2>So we had just come back from spending </v>
<v Speaker 2>the holidays with my grandmother who </v>

35
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.270
<v Speaker 2>pumps them up with sugar while we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and there's nothing I can do with </v>

36
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.671
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we'd get back and I'm having them </v>

37
00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:39.671
<v Speaker 2>making my boy's dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're eight and 11 and uh,</v>

38
00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:44.200
<v Speaker 2>my wife's out and after the dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my eight year old says or weakened </v>

39
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 2>desert and my 11 year old goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

40
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.700
<v Speaker 1>nic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dad,</v>

41
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:47.900
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you crazy?</v>

42
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Wake up son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

43
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I got into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

45
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.260
<v Speaker 1>I was a physics major in college.</v>

46
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Shows was like hard science and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't any good at.</v>

47
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.140
<v Speaker 2>I got a c minus and quantum physics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>my advisor suggested I find another </v>

48
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.140
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So went into journalism,</v>

49
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:11.141
<v Speaker 2>started doing science writing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>early eighties because it was the only </v>

50
00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:12.650
<v Speaker 2>work I could get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then my first book I went to live at</v>

51
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.550
<v Speaker 2>cern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big particle accelerator lab outside</v>

52
00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:21.020
<v Speaker 2>of Geneva and I was what we would call </v>
<v Speaker 2>today embedded with the physicists and I</v>

53
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:23.660
<v Speaker 2>thought it was going to be following.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making this great discovery,</v>

54
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:28.661
<v Speaker 2>which is what the Nobel laureate who ran</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experiment was predicting and </v>

55
00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:30.680
<v Speaker 2>instead I spent 10 months watching them </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out how they screwed up.</v>

56
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a learning experience in how </v>

57
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.201
<v Speaker 2>to do science right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was obsessed with how hard it is </v>

58
00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:41.080
<v Speaker 2>to do good science and I had a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the physicists in the world really </v>

59
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.491
<v Speaker 2>didn't like this Nobel laureate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they were happy to point out to me </v>

60
00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:48.671
<v Speaker 2>how he was screwing up and how he </v>
<v Speaker 2>screwed up in the past and how he even </v>

61
00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:49.550
<v Speaker 2>screwed up the work that he won the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobel prize for.</v>

62
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after I came back I thought that was </v>

63
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.860
<v Speaker 2>actually paid six and the New York Post,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when my book came out,</v>

64
00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:02.861
<v Speaker 2>the headline was Aig had over Nobel </v>
<v Speaker 2>prize and this Nobel laureate who was </v>

65
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:06.450
<v Speaker 2>calling me an asshole in the newspaper </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm 29 years old.</v>

66
00:03:06.451 --> 00:03:07.440
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Assume my Jordan,</v>

67
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my career over.</v>

68
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 2>What was he calling you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>An asshole over.</v>

69
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I ended up writing an expo say,</v>

70
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 2>but what a bad scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was about the politics of science,</v>

71
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was,</v>

72
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I went to Stockholm with this guy when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he won the Nobel prize.</v>

73
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean we got our talks is fitted </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

74
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:26.881
<v Speaker 2>I was a guest at the Nobel dinner and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nobel banquet and the party that </v>

75
00:03:26.881 --> 00:03:31.861
<v Speaker 2>follows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the most fun I've ever had in </v>

76
00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:31.861
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

77
00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:31.861
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stockholm,</v>

78
00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 2>throw a party for the laureates and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

79
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 2>back then it was crazy.</v>

80
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

81
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:42.931
<v Speaker 2>so he was justifiably pissed off that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just wrote what I saw instead of what a </v>

82
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:47.371
<v Speaker 2>great man he thought he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought my career was going to be </v>

83
00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 2>over right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're called an asshole.</v>

84
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 2>And the papers when you were 29 year old</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists by Nobel laureate,</v>

85
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 2>but instead everybody I would interview </v>
<v Speaker 2>in science would say,</v>

86
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think that guy was bad,</v>

87
00:03:56.261 --> 00:04:01.261
<v Speaker 2>you should write about this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just started covering different </v>

88
00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:05.521
<v Speaker 2>aspects and it turns out you could get </v>
<v Speaker 2>along way in science if you're willing </v>

89
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 2>to sort of cut corners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's not actually cheating,</v>

90
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.910
<v Speaker 2>it's just you could discover a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff if you're not willing to do the </v>

91
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.910
<v Speaker 2>rigorous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>

92
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 2>critical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptical work to demonstrate that.</v>

93
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 2>Would you say you have discovered is </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

94
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote a book about something called</v>

95
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:27.511
<v Speaker 2>Cold Fusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a great scientific fiasco of </v>

96
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 2>the 20th century except for the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing about now.</v>

97
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 2>And some of my friends in the physics </v>
<v Speaker 2>community said,</v>

98
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 2>if you're interested in bad science book</v>
<v Speaker 2>was called bad science.</v>

99
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:41.191
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should look at this stuff in public </v>

100
00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:42.841
<v Speaker 2>health because it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I moved into public health </v>

101
00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:46.980
<v Speaker 2>beginning with this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>electromagnetic fields from power lines </v>

102
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 2>will cause brain cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leukemia and everything.</v>

103
00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:53.521
<v Speaker 2>I had learned about what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how rigorous and meticulous and </v>

104
00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:57.211
<v Speaker 2>skeptical and thoughtful you had to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get the right answer and physics.</v>

105
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:00.430
<v Speaker 2>The public health people didn't think it</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to do.</v>

106
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.460
<v Speaker 2>They thought it was kind of a luxury </v>
<v Speaker 2>because their science is harder and it </v>

107
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.821
<v Speaker 2>is kind of harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with like chronic </v>

108
00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:11.341
<v Speaker 2>diseases that happen over decades and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and messy systems and you can't </v>

109
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:16.531
<v Speaker 2>measure anything and everything I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned was that if you don't do this </v>

110
00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the wrong answer.</v>

111
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.200
<v Speaker 2>So by the late nineties I had stumbled </v>
<v Speaker 2>into nutrition research and this is </v>

112
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 2>maybe a longer story than you want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

113
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 2>I was living here in Venice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

114
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.420
<v Speaker 2>I was freelancing for the journal </v>
<v Speaker 2>Science,</v>

115
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 2>so was what's called a contributing </v>
<v Speaker 2>correspondent and I needed a paycheck to</v>

116
00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 2>pay my rent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I called my editor and I said,</v>

117
00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:41.731
<v Speaker 2>what do you got?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of story could I turn over </v>

118
00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:43.831
<v Speaker 2>quickly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said there was a diet study that </v>

119
00:05:43.831 --> 00:05:47.891
<v Speaker 2>was coming out in the New England </v>
<v Speaker 2>Journal of Medicine in two weeks and </v>

120
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:51.630
<v Speaker 2>they want to do an article about him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know is that this diet study </v>

121
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 2>had been leaked to science and advance </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the person who leaked that had given</v>

122
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 2>them a list of sources to talk to who </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaks a diet study right,</v>

123
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 2>to a trial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was a dash diet,</v>

124
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 2>dietary approaches to stop hypertension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the most today,</v>

125
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 2>US news and World Report says it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthiest diet in the world based on,</v>

126
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like force studies that did not </v>

127
00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.490
<v Speaker 2>demonstrate anything.</v>

128
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you do those stories as a </v>

129
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.981
<v Speaker 2>journalist is you interview the </v>
<v Speaker 2>principal investigator and you ask him </v>

130
00:06:23.981 --> 00:06:27.671
<v Speaker 2>who to talk to when he gives you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of names to talk to who can talk </v>

131
00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:27.671
<v Speaker 2>about the study even though it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>published.</v>

132
00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 2>And then you get three interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is enough to justify a page in the</v>

133
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:33.480
<v Speaker 2>magazine and you get your paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

134
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.920
<v Speaker 2>so I interviewed the Pie and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviewed one of the people on the </v>

135
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.131
<v Speaker 2>list of documents that had been leaked </v>
<v Speaker 2>to science and that was a former </v>

136
00:06:42.131 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 2>president of the American heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>association,</v>

137
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 2>and she told me she couldn't talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this study or she'd lose her funding.</v>

138
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.880
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on man,</v>

139
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:54.881
<v Speaker 2>this isn't Sanko era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union people don't lose their </v>

140
00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:56.690
<v Speaker 2>funding for talking to a journalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a diet study.</v>

141
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 2>And she refused to talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

142
00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 2>let's go off the record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>complete confidentiality if I'm going to</v>

143
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 2>miss a story that you're not telling me </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bad,</v>

144
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 2>couldn't get her to talk.</v>

145
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.000
<v Speaker 2>And then I call one of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Pi told me to talk to and he sounded</v>

146
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.420
<v Speaker 2>exactly like Walter Matthau on the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>side of the telephone was very weird and</v>

147
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:21.761
<v Speaker 2>Walter's starts yelling at me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no controversy over solid and </v>

148
00:07:21.761 --> 00:07:22.120
<v Speaker 2>high blood pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going.</v>

149
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:27.130
<v Speaker 2>But Walter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not calling about salt and high </v>

150
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.021
<v Speaker 2>blood pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm calling about this dash diet coming </v>

151
00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these keeps going on.</v>

152
00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 2>There's no controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence.</v>

153
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:33.110
<v Speaker 2>It's all doesn't cause high blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure.</v>

154
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.840
<v Speaker 2>So I get off the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call up my editor,</v>

155
00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:40.840
<v Speaker 2>I said I'm going to finish this story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had this former Aha presidency.</v>

156
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.800
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't talk to me and if she loses</v>
<v Speaker 2>her funding.</v>

157
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:46.250
<v Speaker 2>And then I had Walter Matthau yelling at</v>
<v Speaker 2>me that um,</v>

158
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 2>there's no controversy over in the high </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood pressure.</v>

159
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:52.790
<v Speaker 2>There must be a controversy over whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>salt causes high blood pressure.</v>

160
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to turn this story and pay </v>

161
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.131
<v Speaker 2>my rent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I spent the next nine months </v>

162
00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 2>doing an investigation for science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed I think 85 sources for one</v>

163
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 2>magazine article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got paid for like six weeks,</v>

164
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 2>pissed off my fiance at the time because</v>
<v Speaker 2>she thought she's going to date someone.</v>

165
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:12.750
<v Speaker 2>They should have a better sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

166
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.650
<v Speaker 2>work efficiency ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

167
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:22.420
<v Speaker 2>the conclusion was that the only way you</v>
<v Speaker 2>would believe that salt causes high </v>

168
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.261
<v Speaker 2>blood pressure from the studies that had</v>
<v Speaker 2>been done to that point was if God told </v>

169
00:08:26.261 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 2>you so perf personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could ignore all the evidence and</v>

170
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:33.530
<v Speaker 2>all the randomized control trials name </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the observational evidence.</v>

171
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 2>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what everyone had done.</v>

172
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did this start?</v>

173
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Because I had heard that before as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's heard that before and I had </v>

174
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:47.011
<v Speaker 1>read a long time ago that that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and that salt is actually an </v>

175
00:08:47.011 --> 00:08:50.551
<v Speaker 1>essential mineral and it's important for</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body and it doesn't cause high </v>

176
00:08:50.551 --> 00:08:52.300
<v Speaker 1>blood pressure and there's a host of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other factors should be considered.</v>

177
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.740
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

178
00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was kind intuitively.</v>

179
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 2>It was an interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make biological sense.</v>

180
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:01.220
<v Speaker 2>When you consume salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also have to take in water.</v>

181
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.890
<v Speaker 2>That's why they feed pretzels and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

182
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.900
<v Speaker 2>salty peanuts at bars because you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take in liquids so that you can </v>

183
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.581
<v Speaker 2>maintain the same sodium concentration </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your blood because your cells like </v>

184
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.120
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

185
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:20.121
<v Speaker 2>the chemical reactions that drive your </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells are dependent on the sodium ratio </v>

186
00:09:20.121 --> 00:09:21.720
<v Speaker 2>in the cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you take in more salt,</v>

187
00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:26.721
<v Speaker 2>you're going to drink more fluid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to have in a more </v>

188
00:09:26.721 --> 00:09:29.661
<v Speaker 2>fluid in your circulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to increase your blood </v>

189
00:09:29.661 --> 00:09:31.290
<v Speaker 2>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it does happen in a very short term.</v>

190
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:36.830
<v Speaker 2>But the question is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a chronic cause of high blood pressure </v>

191
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 2>and hypertension and once the </v>
<v Speaker 2>researchers decided was,</v>

192
00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:42.000
<v Speaker 2>and these guys are terrible scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

193
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:44.130
<v Speaker 2>I hate to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in my first book,</v>

194
00:09:44.131 --> 00:09:45.450
<v Speaker 2>good calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad calories,</v>

195
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:46.690
<v Speaker 2>in the epilogue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pointed out,</v>

196
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.130
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

197
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:52.131
<v Speaker 2>I never used the word scientist to </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe any of these people doing </v>

198
00:09:52.131 --> 00:09:56.210
<v Speaker 2>research except for a few specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>examples because they don't really </v>

199
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.300
<v Speaker 2>understand what science is and how to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

200
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:02.300
<v Speaker 2>And they weren't to their defense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just were never taught how to be </v>

201
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.351
<v Speaker 2>scientists or physicians and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutritionists who had a sloppy </v>

202
00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:11.571
<v Speaker 2>scientific training and they thought it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was easy and you get a hypothesis and </v>

203
00:10:11.571 --> 00:10:12.900
<v Speaker 2>you confirm the hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he didn't confirm it,</v>

204
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.890
<v Speaker 2>they thought it must be true anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you find the data.</v>

205
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:21.891
<v Speaker 2>When people talk about Cherry picking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means you find that data that does </v>

206
00:10:21.891 --> 00:10:26.121
<v Speaker 2>sort of confirm and you ignore the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

207
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:31.131
<v Speaker 2>that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote this article is called the </v>

208
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:31.131
<v Speaker 2>political science of salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

209
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.340
<v Speaker 2>won some awards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And while I was doing that,</v>

210
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Walter Matthau character took </v>

211
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.120
<v Speaker 2>credit not just for getting Americans to</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat less salt,</v>

212
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.330
<v Speaker 2>putting us on this low salt diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took credit for getting us on the low</v>

213
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:47.331
<v Speaker 2>fat diet that we were all waiting in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties and I got off the phone with </v>

214
00:10:47.331 --> 00:10:48.960
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called my editor at science and I said,</v>

215
00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:51.240
<v Speaker 2>when I'm done writing about salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to write about fat.</v>

216
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:56.570
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what the story is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this guy is clearly one of the five </v>

217
00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 2>were scientists I've ever interviewed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>

218
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.200
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I learned in my physics </v>

219
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.770
<v Speaker 2>period was at bad scientists never get </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right answer.</v>

220
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.280
<v Speaker 2>So I spent a year doing an investigation</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the journal Science on dietary fat </v>

221
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.940
<v Speaker 2>that paid for about two months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to be a trend here.</v>

222
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was bad.</v>

223
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.110
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>

224
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.780
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to do that to get the right </v>

225
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:23.780
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

226
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why so much has journalism is</v>

227
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.330
<v Speaker 2>so shallow is because if you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>put in the time you get paid for,</v>

228
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.170
<v Speaker 2>it's all you can do as a shallow job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody can afford to do that.</v>

229
00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:33.840
<v Speaker 2>I actually had corporate jobs that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed me,</v>

230
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like writing speeches and press releases</v>

231
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:39.120
<v Speaker 2>for IBM that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

232
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:44.121
<v Speaker 2>I really hated doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that paid well and like that was my </v>

233
00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:45.330
<v Speaker 2>corporate work so I could do the pro </v>
<v Speaker 2>bono stuff I cared about.</v>

234
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

235
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.110
<v Speaker 2>That story was the same unless God told </v>
<v Speaker 2>you personally.</v>

236
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:55.670
<v Speaker 2>So I ended up doing this cover story for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the New York Times magazine called what </v>

237
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 2>if it's all been a big fat lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which came out July 2002.</v>

238
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:03.811
<v Speaker 2>It was probably the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the top five most controversial </v>

239
00:12:03.811 --> 00:12:08.700
<v Speaker 2>articles ever ran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea was I wanted to see what </v>

240
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.990
<v Speaker 2>caused the obesity epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was what I pitched to the editor,</v>

241
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.970
<v Speaker 2>but we had this idea that you get fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>from eating dietary fat.</v>

242
00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:20.971
<v Speaker 2>That was actually the primary logic </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind putting the country on low fat </v>

243
00:12:20.971 --> 00:12:24.721
<v Speaker 2>diets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought it might help heart </v>

244
00:12:24.721 --> 00:12:26.701
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they hadn't been able to show it in </v>

245
00:12:26.701 --> 00:12:28.471
<v Speaker 2>trials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they just assumed if we ate less </v>

246
00:12:28.471 --> 00:12:28.471
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd lose weight because fat,</v>

247
00:12:28.471 --> 00:12:33.120
<v Speaker 2>denser calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was always this competing </v>

248
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.540
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis that had been buried and </v>
<v Speaker 2>swept aside and ignored and you know,</v>

249
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.600
<v Speaker 2>inhibited which was at the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the carbohydrates,</v>

250
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.390
<v Speaker 2>particularly sugar and refined grains.</v>

251
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.830
<v Speaker 2>And so when I got this cover story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a big book advance.</v>

252
00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:52.831
<v Speaker 2>Finally I could afford to do the book I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted it paid for four years of my </v>

253
00:12:52.831 --> 00:12:53.650
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The book took five.</v>

254
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same financial issues.</v>

255
00:12:58.061 --> 00:13:03.061
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I love it because people accused me </v>

256
00:13:03.061 --> 00:13:05.461
<v Speaker 2>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just going to write anything I </v>

257
00:13:05.461 --> 00:13:05.470
<v Speaker 2>could find for a paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I finally got a big paycheck.</v>

258
00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:10.471
<v Speaker 2>And so now one of the ideas there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerged out of my research.</v>

259
00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:15.850
<v Speaker 2>So even when I wrote the 2002 piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that we got fat because we ate</v>

260
00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:20.851
<v Speaker 2>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know there's a line in that article </v>

261
00:13:20.851 --> 00:13:23.191
<v Speaker 2>piece to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course has caused by consuming too </v>

262
00:13:23.191 --> 00:13:23.680
<v Speaker 2>many calories and we can more calories </v>
<v Speaker 2>than we consume.</v>

263
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.510
<v Speaker 2>By the time I was done with this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was one of the most inane</v>

264
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 2>scientific ideas that had ever come </v>
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>

265
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:36.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost incomprehensible to me even </v>

266
00:13:36.001 --> 00:13:38.341
<v Speaker 2>though I know exactly the history of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea and where it came from and why we </v>

267
00:13:38.341 --> 00:13:42.301
<v Speaker 2>believe that it's just crazy naive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the one that I get the </v>

268
00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:48.721
<v Speaker 2>feedback on because I'm out there saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>so 99 percent of obesity researchers and</v>

269
00:13:49.601 --> 00:13:54.601
<v Speaker 2>nutritionists and all our public health </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy is based fundamentally on this </v>

270
00:13:54.601 --> 00:13:59.551
<v Speaker 2>concept that we get because we eat too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much or too sedentary and what I was </v>

271
00:14:00.701 --> 00:14:03.220
<v Speaker 2>saying was not only is that naive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningless,</v>

272
00:14:03.221 --> 00:14:08.221
<v Speaker 2>it's a description.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an explanation and we could go </v>

273
00:14:08.221 --> 00:14:08.710
<v Speaker 2>into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly.</v>

274
00:14:08.711 --> 00:14:13.711
<v Speaker 2>Obesity is a hormonal metabolic defect </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact the best scientists in the </v>

275
00:14:13.711 --> 00:14:18.031
<v Speaker 2>world prior to World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best far and away the best medical </v>

276
00:14:18.031 --> 00:14:18.520
<v Speaker 2>science was done in Germany and Austria </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Europe.</v>

277
00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:23.560
<v Speaker 2>The US was a backwater of medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>science until postwar just,</v>

278
00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:28.060
<v Speaker 2>it was a backwater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually all science and these guys had</v>

279
00:14:28.061 --> 00:14:31.300
<v Speaker 2>concluded that obesity had to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolic hormonal defect,</v>

280
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.060
<v Speaker 2>but the American doctors were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

281
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:39.690
<v Speaker 2>the hormonal thing obesity's Ramona was </v>
<v Speaker 2>an excuse for fat people to not eat in </v>

282
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.610
<v Speaker 2>moderation and run marathons like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>saline people do,</v>

283
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:48.390
<v Speaker 2>and what I did is I brought that </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis sort of advantage with the </v>

284
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:53.161
<v Speaker 2>war literally evaporated with the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The German Austrian medical community </v>

285
00:14:53.161 --> 00:14:57.311
<v Speaker 2>evaporated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wanted nothing to do with these </v>

286
00:14:57.311 --> 00:14:58.220
<v Speaker 2>researchers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Ivy League universities had policies</v>

287
00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 2>in place to keep from being overrun by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish academicians from Europe,</v>

288
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:07.390
<v Speaker 2>so then physics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we embrace them because we had bombs to </v>

289
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.270
<v Speaker 2>build in a cold war to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but medicine and public health,</v>

290
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:13.271
<v Speaker 2>we wanted nothing to do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this hypothesis evaporates and </v>

291
00:15:13.271 --> 00:15:13.271
<v Speaker 2>postwar.</v>

292
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.910
<v Speaker 2>You get this creation of basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>obesity research created Denovo by </v>

293
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:25.001
<v Speaker 2>these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the young doctors have no </v>

294
00:15:25.001 --> 00:15:25.920
<v Speaker 2>scientific training who are leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who hate the German,</v>

295
00:15:25.921 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 2>so they're not going to pope the German </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>

296
00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:33.041
<v Speaker 2>even if they read it and nutritionists </v>
<v Speaker 2>who do animal research and never even </v>

297
00:15:33.041 --> 00:15:37.931
<v Speaker 2>studied obese people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you get this idea that it's an </v>

298
00:15:37.931 --> 00:15:37.931
<v Speaker 2>eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

299
00:15:37.931 --> 00:15:42.410
<v Speaker 2>it's a calorie overconsumption problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the 19 sixties.</v>

300
00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:47.471
<v Speaker 2>The field is dominated by psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 2>and psychiatrists who are studying ways </v>

301
00:15:47.471 --> 00:15:49.850
<v Speaker 2>to get obese people to just stop eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>so damn much.</v>

302
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.540
<v Speaker 2>They didn't try to make them exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>back then.</v>

303
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.950
<v Speaker 2>That was kind of torture they would push</v>
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

304
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.460
<v Speaker 2>So this was the thing I get feedback on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why I'm saying,</v>

305
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire medical nutritional obesity,</v>

306
00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:08.480
<v Speaker 2>diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogma is based on just a bad idea.</v>

307
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a failed paradigm and you know,</v>

308
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.900
<v Speaker 2>who's going to accept that coming from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalist.</v>

309
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.390
<v Speaker 2>So the answer is either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

310
00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:22.391
<v Speaker 2>I'm an idiot or I'm self interested and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm only making this up to get a </v>

311
00:16:22.391 --> 00:16:24.020
<v Speaker 2>paycheck or just wrong.</v>

312
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel vindicated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like when you see what's going on now</v>

313
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:32.680
<v Speaker 1>where it's a pretty much common </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that sugar is terrible for you</v>

314
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.860
<v Speaker 1>and that added sugar is a huge factor in</v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes and hypertension and heart </v>

315
00:16:38.411 --> 00:16:43.180
<v Speaker 1>disease and obesity and it's pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the board now.</v>

316
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Did you feel vindicated when you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

317
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:50.720
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing that the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though they're public health </v>

318
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.380
<v Speaker 2>organizations that are now saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

319
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:55.310
<v Speaker 2>gotta cut back on the sugar and putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>limits on sugar consumption.</v>

320
00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.640
<v Speaker 2>The logic is still that it's just empty </v>
<v Speaker 2>calories.</v>

321
00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:02.870
<v Speaker 2>That's still the logic by who though </v>
<v Speaker 2>they public health authorities,</v>

322
00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:04.440
<v Speaker 2>the researchers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

323
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Why do they lag so far behind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this is fascinating to me </v>

324
00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.651
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that there must be a guy </v>

325
00:17:12.651 --> 00:17:16.011
<v Speaker 1>like you who does what's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous and spending nine months on </v>

326
00:17:16.011 --> 00:17:20.210
<v Speaker 1>six weeks worth of pay and it does that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of shit because otherwise once an </v>

327
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:21.660
<v Speaker 1>idea is clearly established and gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeated,</v>

328
00:17:21.661 --> 00:17:24.300
<v Speaker 1>like salt causes hypertension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean God damn it.</v>

329
00:17:24.301 --> 00:17:25.740
<v Speaker 1>If you ask the average person on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>

330
00:17:25.741 --> 00:17:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does salt causes high blood pressure?</v>

331
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

332
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.140
<v Speaker 1>they just say it because it's like sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this peripheral idea.</v>

333
00:17:31.141 --> 00:17:33.390
<v Speaker 1>They hear it in the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't research it,</v>

334
00:17:33.391 --> 00:17:38.391
<v Speaker 1>they don't really look into it very far </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than maybe they read something </v>

335
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.931
<v Speaker 1>somewhere at one point in time and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just decide it's dogma and they </v>

336
00:17:41.931 --> 00:17:42.480
<v Speaker 1>repeat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>

337
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:47.520
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly difficult once an idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that gets established in our </v>

338
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.270
<v Speaker 1>society too to eradicate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

339
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.480
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing,</v>

340
00:17:51.481 --> 00:17:53.580
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of when you live in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

341
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:58.581
<v Speaker 2>in an institution where everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes exactly what you do and so the </v>

342
00:17:58.581 --> 00:17:59.010
<v Speaker 2>people you respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about it,</v>

343
00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:01.260
<v Speaker 2>the people you respect are the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who think like you do,</v>

344
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.990
<v Speaker 2>who agree with you on the important </v>
<v Speaker 2>points because you think,</v>

345
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:04.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're smart.</v>

346
00:18:04.711 --> 00:18:09.711
<v Speaker 2>They get it just like I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So institutions sort of collect group </v>

347
00:18:09.711 --> 00:18:14.631
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a natural emergent phenomenon </v>

348
00:18:14.631 --> 00:18:15.330
<v Speaker 2>from institutions and now if you look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the data,</v>

349
00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:17.190
<v Speaker 2>you're somebody like me and you come </v>
<v Speaker 2>along and you say,</v>

350
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:22.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't really buy this idea so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just empty calories.</v>

351
00:18:22.081 --> 00:18:24.450
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to look at the data and see</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it says,</v>

352
00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:29.451
<v Speaker 2>and now you try to convince your friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're wrong and now you're the </v>

353
00:18:29.451 --> 00:18:31.310
<v Speaker 2>heretic and you're the one who's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

354
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:36.320
<v Speaker 2>you're getting in arguments with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they make people uncomfortable </v>

355
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.830
<v Speaker 2>because you're trying to get them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change their minds about thumps and they</v>

356
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:40.610
<v Speaker 2>all believe and they've all been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

357
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.570
<v Speaker 2>they're successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're promoted,</v>

358
00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:47.571
<v Speaker 2>they're leaders in their field because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they believed this and now you're </v>

359
00:18:47.881 --> 00:18:52.090
<v Speaker 2>telling them that and people do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

360
00:18:52.091 --> 00:18:57.091
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this just keeps going and going and </v>

361
00:18:57.091 --> 00:18:57.091
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

362
00:18:57.091 --> 00:18:57.091
<v Speaker 2>And even to the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

363
00:18:57.091 --> 00:19:01.161
<v Speaker 2>just when my sugar book came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a book called the secret life </v>

364
00:19:01.161 --> 00:19:05.121
<v Speaker 2>of fat written by a phd and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's as though everything I've done in </v>

365
00:19:06.301 --> 00:19:10.500
<v Speaker 2>the past 15 years just who's never done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like somehow she managed to do an entire</v>

366
00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:13.440
<v Speaker 2>book on dietary fat where if anyone said</v>
<v Speaker 2>to her,</v>

367
00:19:13.441 --> 00:19:15.720
<v Speaker 2>talk to Tobbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if he's wrong,</v>

368
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.350
<v Speaker 2>his ideas are worth hearing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

369
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.720
<v Speaker 2>they're provocative and interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so sure he's wrong.</v>

370
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:27.230
<v Speaker 2>She decided not to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it sort of do you have the two was </v>

371
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.090
<v Speaker 2>her conclusion and effectively it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

372
00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:35.091
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all comes back effectively to energy </v>

373
00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:37.371
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could talk about the two </v>

374
00:19:37.371 --> 00:19:37.371
<v Speaker 2>overconsumption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

375
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.100
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what dogmas do.</v>

376
00:19:41.101 --> 00:19:41.900
<v Speaker 2>They just take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

377
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:46.970
<v Speaker 2>they reproduce themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they continue to grow there like tumors </v>

378
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:47.010
<v Speaker 2>for that fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

379
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:52.011
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically fight off all challenges </v>

380
00:19:52.011 --> 00:19:52.011
<v Speaker 2>they absorb around them.</v>

381
00:19:52.011 --> 00:19:54.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so somebody starts saying it's something</v>

382
00:19:54.751 --> 00:19:55.560
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually,</v>

383
00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:57.790
<v Speaker 2>ideally everything changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're,</v>

384
00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.820
<v Speaker 2>we're definitely winning the sugar </v>
<v Speaker 2>battle.</v>

385
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.940
<v Speaker 2>So in sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though that the official word is </v>

386
00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.521
<v Speaker 2>it's empty calories would just have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>consume less because they have this </v>

387
00:20:07.521 --> 00:20:10.350
<v Speaker 2>dogma that obesity is caused by </v>
<v Speaker 2>consuming too many calories.</v>

388
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.480
<v Speaker 2>So the way that a food influences your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body mass is through its caloric content</v>

389
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:18.750
<v Speaker 2>or how much of those calories you digest</v>
<v Speaker 2>and absorb.</v>

390
00:20:18.751 --> 00:20:23.460
<v Speaker 2>Because if it's got fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo excrete some and that's the,</v>

391
00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:28.461
<v Speaker 2>that's the wisdom of a calorie is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>calorie than the worst you could say </v>

392
00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:29.520
<v Speaker 2>about sugar is that it's empty calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got no vitamins and minerals,</v>

393
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:34.521
<v Speaker 2>micronutrients attached.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we consume too much of it and </v>

394
00:20:34.521 --> 00:20:35.940
<v Speaker 2>that people say it's the low hanging </v>
<v Speaker 2>fruit,</v>

395
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:41.330
<v Speaker 2>so it's not that it's uniquely toxic </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of it's uniquely toxic if it </v>

396
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:45.141
<v Speaker 2>actually causes disease and we can talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about clearly what I'm saying it causes </v>

397
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.690
<v Speaker 2>than a calorie isn't a calorie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you started doing this research and</v>

398
00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:53.630
<v Speaker 2>you started writing this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case against sugar w,</v>

399
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:58.630
<v Speaker 2>W,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when this was all unfolding in front of </v>

400
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.630
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you,</v>

401
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.630
<v Speaker 2>will you shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

402
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.550
<v Speaker 2>is this something that you were where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were saying,</v>

403
00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:05.551
<v Speaker 2>how am I a guy who got a c plus c minus?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to pump you up.</v>

404
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:09.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

405
00:21:09.961 --> 00:21:12.010
<v Speaker 2>how am I the guy who's figuring this </v>
<v Speaker 2>out?</v>

406
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.660
<v Speaker 2>How is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

407
00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:16.680
<v Speaker 2>So I understood why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is weird because again,</v>

408
00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.420
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

409
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:22.470
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I was in Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my book tour and I had dinner with the </v>

410
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:26.011
<v Speaker 2>former chief science medical science and</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical officer with the American </v>

411
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Diabetes Association.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So very influential,</v>

412
00:21:30.311 --> 00:21:35.311
<v Speaker 2>high ranking successful man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's completely convinced that I'm </v>

413
00:21:35.311 --> 00:21:35.311
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

414
00:21:35.311 --> 00:21:39.940
<v Speaker 2>why you believe this thing that obesity </v>
<v Speaker 2>is caused by eating too much and you </v>

415
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.801
<v Speaker 2>have no idea why you believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can tell you exactly the history of</v>

416
00:21:43.871 --> 00:21:48.871
<v Speaker 2>that belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like if we were talking about </v>

417
00:21:48.871 --> 00:21:49.240
<v Speaker 2>relativity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can go back to Einstein and you would</v>

418
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:51.940
<v Speaker 2>know about Einstein and even if we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking quantum physics,</v>

419
00:21:51.941 --> 00:21:56.941
<v Speaker 2>we'd go back to Isenberg and trodden </v>
<v Speaker 2>juror and bore and p and you'd know </v>

420
00:21:56.941 --> 00:22:01.231
<v Speaker 2>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this belief that you're </v>

421
00:22:01.231 --> 00:22:01.231
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally arguing is right.</v>

422
00:22:01.231 --> 00:22:01.780
<v Speaker 2>You don't understand where it comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

423
00:22:01.781 --> 00:22:04.360
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell you that and I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you the documents.</v>

424
00:22:04.361 --> 00:22:07.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you the papers where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it out competes,</v>

425
00:22:07.211 --> 00:22:12.211
<v Speaker 2>the hormonal metabolic idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to give you the competing </v>

426
00:22:12.211 --> 00:22:15.121
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis you didn't even know existed </v>
<v Speaker 2>until you and I talked.</v>

427
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:19.480
<v Speaker 2>You started reading my stuff and it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero influence on how this guy thinks.</v>

428
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.100
<v Speaker 2>He's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so convinced these.</v>

429
00:22:21.101 --> 00:22:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's terrifying.</v>

430
00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:27.820
<v Speaker 2>That's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When someone has that kind of influence </v>

431
00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:27.820
<v Speaker 2>over the American people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

432
00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.280
<v Speaker 2>and this is a thing you want somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>who does at least say Jesus,</v>

433
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:31.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought of that.</v>

434
00:22:31.691 --> 00:22:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Let me at least have them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me read these and get back to you is</v>

435
00:22:35.081 --> 00:22:36.430
<v Speaker 2>what you want them to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to.</v>

436
00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:41.490
<v Speaker 2>The problem of course is that if he </v>
<v Speaker 2>agrees to this and then he agrees that </v>

437
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:45.211
<v Speaker 2>you're correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that he's been saying up </v>

438
00:22:45.211 --> 00:22:45.211
<v Speaker 2>until now has been bullshit and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been misleading people.</v>

439
00:22:45.211 --> 00:22:48.310
<v Speaker 2>He has to apologize history as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once you do that,</v>

440
00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.370
<v Speaker 2>you lose your credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like ideally and science here,</v>

441
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best scientists,</v>

442
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:53.560
<v Speaker 2>the ones who say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

443
00:22:53.561 --> 00:22:54.560
<v Speaker 2>I was just wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

444
00:22:55.060 --> 00:23:00.060
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how they were actually when I was </v>

445
00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.691
<v Speaker 2>growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the estimate was five percent of the </v>

446
00:23:03.691 --> 00:23:06.031
<v Speaker 2>scientific community actually does good </v>
<v Speaker 2>science and the other 95 percent are </v>

447
00:23:06.031 --> 00:23:07.600
<v Speaker 2>sort of the chaff out of which you got </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get the wheat.</v>

448
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.480
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

449
00:23:10.481 --> 00:23:11.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to joke,</v>

450
00:23:11.951 --> 00:23:15.740
<v Speaker 2>imagine the American Heart Association </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing the press release to say like,</v>

451
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.580
<v Speaker 2>we were wrong about putting everybody on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a low fat diet.</v>

452
00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:23.610
<v Speaker 2>And it was a mistake and we're sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we apologize and maybe we killed </v>

453
00:23:23.891 --> 00:23:28.060
<v Speaker 2>some of your relatives prematurely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the reason you're fat and diabetic</v>

454
00:23:28.061 --> 00:23:31.570
<v Speaker 2>now is because of our advice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we got to right now,</v>

455
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:32.710
<v Speaker 2>they won't do it.</v>

456
00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.130
<v Speaker 2>He can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's public health wreck.</v>

457
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.900
<v Speaker 2>It's just they can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an untenable.</v>

458
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:42.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say the same thing if I'm wrong in </v>

459
00:23:42.901 --> 00:23:46.081
<v Speaker 2>my book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to have this argument with my </v>

460
00:23:46.081 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 2>cofounder of this nutrition science </v>
<v Speaker 2>initiative,</v>

461
00:23:46.161 --> 00:23:51.161
<v Speaker 2>this not for profit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd say you don't understand if I'm </v>

462
00:23:51.161 --> 00:23:51.290
<v Speaker 2>wrong and the major arguments in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

463
00:23:51.291 --> 00:23:54.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean clearly I'm going to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of the minor ones and you know,</v>

464
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:59.410
<v Speaker 2>chip away here and there are bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>scholarship that I should have tripled </v>

465
00:23:59.410 --> 00:23:59.750
<v Speaker 2>checked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I'm wrong in the major arguments,</v>

466
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.920
<v Speaker 2>I need a new line of work because I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>trust my judgment.</v>

467
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.330
<v Speaker 2>And everything I do as an investigative </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalist is dependent on me being able</v>

468
00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:10.550
<v Speaker 2>to trust my judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I'm wrong about this,</v>

469
00:24:10.551 --> 00:24:13.910
<v Speaker 2>like if I'm wrong about energy balance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to go sell shoes.</v>

470
00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:16.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way around it,</v>

471
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:16.880
<v Speaker 2>but this is.</v>

472
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:23.760
<v Speaker 1>I lost track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were we saying?</v>

473
00:24:23.761 --> 00:24:26.410
<v Speaker 1>What was the question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked too much.</v>

474
00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was asking you first of all,</v>

475
00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:36.050
<v Speaker 1>what is it like to have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding that all of what's being </v>

476
00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:39.390
<v Speaker 1>told to the American people is wrong and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you having this conversation.</v>

477
00:24:39.391 --> 00:24:41.070
<v Speaker 1>So how do I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I do it?</v>

478
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:42.050
<v Speaker 1>How do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I getting</v>

479
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:47.050
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me tell you why I was able to do </v>

480
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:47.050
<v Speaker 2>what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

481
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.550
<v Speaker 2>I was the first person who ever did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that simple.</v>

482
00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:53.120
<v Speaker 2>No one had ever done before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was timing.</v>

483
00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:58.121
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an obsessive research or is 145 </v>

484
00:24:58.461 --> 00:25:01.580
<v Speaker 2>people I interviewed for the fat story </v>
<v Speaker 2>for one magazine Article.</v>

485
00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:06.581
<v Speaker 2>I just keep asking questions and probing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and probing until every ism like </v>

486
00:25:06.581 --> 00:25:07.430
<v Speaker 2>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a great research.</v>

487
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:11.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a procrastination tool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I started this in 2002,</v>

488
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:16.721
<v Speaker 2>when I got the money to do the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet had come along and the </v>

489
00:25:16.721 --> 00:25:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Internet made it possible to find every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single primary source.</v>

490
00:25:19.611 --> 00:25:21.740
<v Speaker 2>Going back to the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like now,</v>

491
00:25:21.741 --> 00:25:25.550
<v Speaker 2>you could almost download them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but back then I had researchers,</v>

492
00:25:25.551 --> 00:25:27.860
<v Speaker 2>young students in in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York,</v>

493
00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:29.840
<v Speaker 2>La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose only job was.</v>

494
00:25:29.841 --> 00:25:34.841
<v Speaker 2>They'd get an email from me with 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>citations and then they'd go to the </v>

495
00:25:34.841 --> 00:25:39.251
<v Speaker 2>library and have to find every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all 50 in xerox them and then ship them </v>

496
00:25:39.251 --> 00:25:40.480
<v Speaker 2>back to me sometimes entire books from </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

497
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

498
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.960
<v Speaker 2>17 diabetes textbook that I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>find or I couldn't buy and bookstores </v>

499
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.560
<v Speaker 2>had put their used bookstores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put their catalogs online so you could </v>

500
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.180
<v Speaker 2>find all the books and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some 19,</v>

501
00:25:56.181 --> 00:25:59.090
<v Speaker 2>47 obesity conference.</v>

502
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.540
<v Speaker 2>The library that has it doesn't see any </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose for that anymore.</v>

503
00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:07.541
<v Speaker 2>So they basically give it to the local </v>
<v Speaker 2>bookstore and you can buy it for seven </v>

504
00:26:07.541 --> 00:26:08.450
<v Speaker 2>bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was able to recreate the history of</v>

505
00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:13.451
<v Speaker 2>obesity research from conference </v>
<v Speaker 2>proceedings were the only people doing </v>

506
00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:19.631
<v Speaker 2>research in the field would show up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would present their findings and </v>

507
00:26:19.631 --> 00:26:23.741
<v Speaker 2>then they would do a proceedings of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>findings and I could recreate all the </v>

508
00:26:23.741 --> 00:26:27.671
<v Speaker 2>thinking in the field and nobody had </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever bothered to do it before and it's </v>

509
00:26:27.671 --> 00:26:30.761
<v Speaker 2>kind of if they were good scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have because they would have </v>

510
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:36.070
<v Speaker 2>been obsessed with where their beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 2>came from and they would have been </v>

511
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:39.551
<v Speaker 2>questioning them and one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have done is gone back to do </v>

512
00:26:39.551 --> 00:26:42.941
<v Speaker 2>all this to see if some assumption they </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe is true is really based on fact.</v>

513
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:48.710
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't really know what science </v>

514
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:49.380
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't all that curious is one way</v>

515
00:26:49.381 --> 00:26:52.080
<v Speaker 2>to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so terrifying.</v>

516
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.940
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so terrifying.</v>

517
00:26:53.941 --> 00:26:58.020
<v Speaker 2>When you know you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think of what people.</v>

518
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.650
<v Speaker 2>Most people are busy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They work all day.</v>

519
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.190
<v Speaker 2>They have families,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have jobs,</v>

520
00:27:02.191 --> 00:27:07.191
<v Speaker 2>they have obligations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the time to do the </v>

521
00:27:07.191 --> 00:27:09.441
<v Speaker 2>research that you did about diet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>come to these shocking conclusions </v>

522
00:27:09.441 --> 00:27:09.810
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to happen,</v>

523
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:14.840
<v Speaker 2>but then they rely on the people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy from the diabetes association </v>

524
00:27:15.391 --> 00:27:20.391
<v Speaker 2>that's supposed to be telling you the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth and looking at the truth and he </v>

525
00:27:20.391 --> 00:27:20.670
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to do it because it makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>them look like an asshole.</v>

526
00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you will also rely on,</v>

527
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:27.261
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are so they read the review</v>
<v Speaker 2>articles and the reviewers and the </v>

528
00:27:27.261 --> 00:27:29.070
<v Speaker 2>editors of the journals want to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>influential review articles,</v>

529
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:34.730
<v Speaker 2>so they ask influential people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>field to do the review articles and </v>

530
00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:35.940
<v Speaker 2>those people are very busy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to do with and they're</v>

531
00:27:35.941 --> 00:27:36.220
<v Speaker 2>gonna.</v>

532
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.090
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They became influential by believing the</v>

533
00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:42.450
<v Speaker 2>conventional wisdom and propagating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conventional wisdom.</v>

534
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.510
<v Speaker 2>When you have committees do </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigations,</v>

535
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:50.810
<v Speaker 2>so every five years you get the dietary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Usta puts together a committee to </v>

536
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.370
<v Speaker 2>reassess the dietary guidelines that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they give out.</v>

537
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:58.910
<v Speaker 2>So the way the committees are formed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they usta picks a very influential </v>

538
00:27:58.910 --> 00:27:59.760
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most influential.</v>

539
00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:04.761
<v Speaker 2>They get to be the head of the committee</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's somebody who's believed the </v>

540
00:28:04.761 --> 00:28:05.310
<v Speaker 2>conventional wisdom and propagate it </v>
<v Speaker 2>their whole life.</v>

541
00:28:05.311 --> 00:28:10.200
<v Speaker 2>That's how they became influential and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then person picks people they respect to</v>

542
00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:12.540
<v Speaker 2>be on the committee and of course the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people they respect,</v>

543
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.720
<v Speaker 2>the people believe what they believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're the ones who seem smart.</v>

544
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:19.170
<v Speaker 2>They're not the heretics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the believers.</v>

545
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.380
<v Speaker 2>So you end up with a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start out just with a natural quest.</v>

546
00:28:22.381 --> 00:28:27.381
<v Speaker 2>We want to know if the guidelines are </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct and through this completely </v>

547
00:28:27.381 --> 00:28:30.741
<v Speaker 2>natural human process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up staffing the guy creating a </v>

548
00:28:30.741 --> 00:28:34.371
<v Speaker 2>committee that's going to recapitulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the conventional wisdom almost 100 </v>

549
00:28:34.371 --> 00:28:36.900
<v Speaker 2>percent and it's just the way things </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

550
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.900
<v Speaker 2>So you need people like me to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>across every once in a while,</v>

551
00:28:42.151 --> 00:28:45.030
<v Speaker 2>assuming I can write better when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like me are right.</v>

552
00:28:45.031 --> 00:28:50.031
<v Speaker 2>Then when they're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to get both types and </v>

553
00:28:50.031 --> 00:28:50.031
<v Speaker 2>we got to come along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to have the persistence,</v>

554
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:55.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that basically just keep doing what we </v>

555
00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:55.590
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was lucky that I also had this podium,</v>

556
00:28:55.591 --> 00:28:59.310
<v Speaker 2>the New York Times magazine editors </v>
<v Speaker 2>trusted me and liked my work.</v>

557
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:04.910
<v Speaker 2>The science editors trusted me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought I would be really good so I </v>

558
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.000
<v Speaker 2>could get an influential publications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have to,</v>

559
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:11.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>published to a blog and try to win </v>

560
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.750
<v Speaker 2>people over.</v>

561
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:17.900
<v Speaker 2>But from their perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just what do you do with </v>

562
00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.420
<v Speaker 2>someone like me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I argued,</v>

563
00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:21.030
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done this research.</v>

564
00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:22.320
<v Speaker 2>You haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

565
00:29:22.321 --> 00:29:23.970
<v Speaker 2>another way to think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

566
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.200
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

567
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:30.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got these obesity and diabetes </v>

568
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.230
<v Speaker 2>epidemics worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

569
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.920
<v Speaker 2>there should be horrifying to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

570
00:29:31.921 --> 00:29:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm in fairly recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

571
00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.270
<v Speaker 2>in terms of human history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of human history,</v>

572
00:29:36.271 --> 00:29:41.271
<v Speaker 2>so one of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I did in the case </v>

573
00:29:41.271 --> 00:29:43.461
<v Speaker 2>against sugar is I went back to find the</v>
<v Speaker 2>very beginnings of the epidemic in the </v>

574
00:29:43.461 --> 00:29:44.770
<v Speaker 2>United States because if you got an </v>
<v Speaker 2>epidemic,</v>

575
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:47.080
<v Speaker 2>like if we had the Zika epidemic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ebola,</v>

576
00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:49.240
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to try to figure out what's</v>

577
00:29:49.241 --> 00:29:54.241
<v Speaker 2>causing a bola by looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>patients who are getting off the </v>

578
00:29:54.241 --> 00:29:55.600
<v Speaker 2>airplane and Houston are showing up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hospital in New Jersey.</v>

579
00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.600
<v Speaker 2>You go back to Africa where it's densest</v>
<v Speaker 2>and where it started and you could </v>

580
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.861
<v Speaker 2>follow it to whatever animal got bit by </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever insect and whatever cave and </v>

581
00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:08.020
<v Speaker 2>that's a natural process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding an epidemic.</v>

582
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:11.630
<v Speaker 2>So I go back here and you can go back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

583
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:15.450
<v Speaker 2>the 19th century and there are hospitals</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the United States,</v>

584
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.820
<v Speaker 2>the date to pre 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 or 18,</v>

585
00:30:18.821 --> 00:30:21.880
<v Speaker 2>64 in the case of Philadelphia Hospital </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Pennsylvania.</v>

586
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:27.210
<v Speaker 2>And that their records anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go there and you can ask the archivist </v>

587
00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:31.800
<v Speaker 2>to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still have their case records from </v>

588
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.931
<v Speaker 2>the 19th century and you can have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>archivist pull up the case records and </v>

589
00:30:34.691 --> 00:30:39.691
<v Speaker 2>they will tell you how many cases of </v>
<v Speaker 2>diabetes were diagnosed in the </v>

590
00:30:39.691 --> 00:30:40.640
<v Speaker 2>hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

591
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.980
<v Speaker 2>any year from like in mass general </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospital in Boston.</v>

592
00:30:44.981 --> 00:30:46.810
<v Speaker 2>The record starting in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>24,</v>

593
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

594
00:30:48.131 --> 00:30:50.620
<v Speaker 2>one in 11 American diabetic.</v>

595
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are some populations like </v>

596
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:57.070
<v Speaker 2>native American populations where one in</v>
<v Speaker 2>two adults are diabetic.</v>

597
00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mass general hospital,</v>

598
00:31:00.041 --> 00:31:01.720
<v Speaker 2>that leading hospital in the country and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

599
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:06.840
<v Speaker 2>in Massachusetts in the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were year after year after year </v>

600
00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.740
<v Speaker 2>were hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had zero cases of diabetes and this</v>

601
00:31:08.741 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 2>was a terrible disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without insulin,</v>

602
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:14.290
<v Speaker 2>it's not a pleasure with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before insulin was discovered,</v>

603
00:31:14.291 --> 00:31:16.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean you go blind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kidney failure,</v>

604
00:31:16.631 --> 00:31:18.040
<v Speaker 2>gangrene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amputation.</v>

605
00:31:18.041 --> 00:31:23.041
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a difficult diagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there are the reasons to explain the</v>

606
00:31:23.411 --> 00:31:24.340
<v Speaker 2>absence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

607
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:29.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only people showed up in hospitals </v>

608
00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:32.700
<v Speaker 2>back in the 19th century were poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and poor people eat a lot less </v>

609
00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:33.460
<v Speaker 2>sugar than rich people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

610
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:38.520
<v Speaker 2>So enrich people got their own private </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor so they might not have shown up </v>

611
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.200
<v Speaker 2>in the diabetes in the medical record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can,</v>

612
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:43.960
<v Speaker 2>you got to always be skeptical of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think you're learning because that's</v>

613
00:31:43.961 --> 00:31:45.040
<v Speaker 2>what science is.</v>

614
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:50.850
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point I'm making is I went through </v>

615
00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.301
<v Speaker 2>the effort to do this one way or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other and that gives me a certain </v>

616
00:31:54.301 --> 00:31:56.350
<v Speaker 2>advantage that they don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they're good scientists,</v>

617
00:31:56.351 --> 00:31:59.980
<v Speaker 2>regardless of what they believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll say to themselves,</v>

618
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:32:01.151 --> 00:32:03.010
<v Speaker 2>I never thought of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never did that.</v>

620
00:32:03.011 --> 00:32:07.000
<v Speaker 2>I can think of these tabs is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe I should look into it.</v>

621
00:32:07.001 --> 00:32:12.001
<v Speaker 2>And where did it all start?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the u s it starts again in the </v>

622
00:32:12.001 --> 00:32:15.361
<v Speaker 2>second half of the 18 19th century and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it starts coincidentally with an </v>

623
00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:20.851
<v Speaker 2>explosion and sugar consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just in how much sugar we're </v>

624
00:32:20.851 --> 00:32:21.730
<v Speaker 2>consuming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who's consuming it,</v>

625
00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:26.500
<v Speaker 2>which is what's fascinating and scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So prior go back,</v>

626
00:32:26.501 --> 00:32:28.630
<v Speaker 2>say 200 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

627
00:32:28.631 --> 00:32:29.630
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

628
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:30.600
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>

629
00:32:30.601 --> 00:32:35.140
<v Speaker 2>we were probably getting about five </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds of sugar per capita in the United</v>

630
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:35.140
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>

631
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:40.140
<v Speaker 2>So that's about five pounds over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of a year per person per year.</v>

632
00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 2>So that's the equivalent of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the sugar,</v>

633
00:32:43.281 --> 00:32:48.281
<v Speaker 2>a one Coca Cola,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 ounce cokes worth of sugar every six </v>

634
00:32:48.281 --> 00:32:49.820
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was the head of the hilarious.</v>

635
00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.960
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's frightening because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's expensive back then,</v>

636
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The attitude back then,</v>

637
00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

638
00:32:57.351 --> 00:32:58.710
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

639
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.120
<v Speaker 2>well they desert courses hadn't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>been invented yet.</v>

640
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.560
<v Speaker 2>Really know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

641
00:33:03.561 --> 00:33:05.210
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wealthy would have dessert,</v>

642
00:33:05.211 --> 00:33:10.211
<v Speaker 2>so the wealthy and the wealthy are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones who would get diabetes and obesity </v>

643
00:33:10.611 --> 00:33:13.070
<v Speaker 2>and gout back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

644
00:33:13.071 --> 00:33:18.071
<v Speaker 2>so sugar has this curve where it goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>from being very rare and just sort of </v>

645
00:33:18.071 --> 00:33:21.551
<v Speaker 2>the luxury of royalty to the wealthy are</v>
<v Speaker 2>using it.</v>

646
00:33:22.611 --> 00:33:27.611
<v Speaker 2>And then finally with the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the industrial revolution and a late </v>

647
00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:33.940
<v Speaker 2>18th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then refining processes or improved </v>

648
00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.120
<v Speaker 2>and sugar starts to get cheaper.</v>

649
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.700
<v Speaker 2>And then during the Napoleonic wars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 18,</v>

650
00:33:37.701 --> 00:33:40.620
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when France has cut from the,</v>

651
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:44.120
<v Speaker 2>from their sugar supply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the English blockades,</v>

652
00:33:44.121 --> 00:33:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Napoleon says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

653
00:33:45.441 --> 00:33:50.441
<v Speaker 2>we got to figure out how to create our </v>
<v Speaker 2>own sugar in this clever Frenchmen and </v>

654
00:33:50.441 --> 00:33:51.710
<v Speaker 2>figures out how to get sugar from sugar </v>
<v Speaker 2>beets.</v>

655
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:55.850
<v Speaker 2>And the beet sugar industry takes off </v>
<v Speaker 2>around 1850.</v>

656
00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then with the beet sugar and street </v>

657
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.400
<v Speaker 2>and sugar in the northern hemisphere and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the temperate climates,</v>

658
00:34:01.401 --> 00:34:05.660
<v Speaker 2>and you could also grow sugar cane and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only in tropical climates.</v>

659
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:10.340
<v Speaker 2>So now sugar prices started to plummet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

660
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:13.790
<v Speaker 2>you think about all the ways we consume </v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar today.</v>

661
00:34:13.791 --> 00:34:15.290
<v Speaker 2>So candy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soft drinks,</v>

662
00:34:15.291 --> 00:34:16.460
<v Speaker 2>ice cream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chocolate.</v>

663
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:20.330
<v Speaker 2>The low fat desserts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low fat milk,</v>

664
00:34:20.331 --> 00:34:23.780
<v Speaker 2>low fat yogurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that existed until 1840.</v>

665
00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.510
<v Speaker 2>So 1840.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is He the start of the candy industry?</v>

666
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:30.810
<v Speaker 2>They started the chocolate industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lint brothers and Switzerland figure</v>

667
00:34:30.811 --> 00:34:32.420
<v Speaker 2>out how to make chocolate bars.</v>

668
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:37.450
<v Speaker 2>They're still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can still buy Lindt chocolate today </v>

669
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:37.520
<v Speaker 2>and it's pretty good actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

670
00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:42.580
<v Speaker 2>ice cream industry starts in the 1840 </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] soft drinks starting the 18 </v>

671
00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.560
<v Speaker 2>seventies with Dr Pepper than Coca Cola </v>
<v Speaker 2>than Pepsico.</v>

672
00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.860
<v Speaker 2>Dr Pepper was first Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pepper was first.</v>

673
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

674
00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like an afterthought.</v>

675
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

676
00:34:52.671 --> 00:34:53.380
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

677
00:34:53.381 --> 00:34:57.230
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have the marketing budgets of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Coca Cola people.</v>

678
00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:02.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so sugar starts becoming like women are </v>

679
00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.240
<v Speaker 2>targeted as cold as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's now cheap enough.</v>

680
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:10.270
<v Speaker 2>So the men get their alcohol and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes and the women get sugar and </v>

681
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:11.960
<v Speaker 2>the kids get sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first time in history,</v>

682
00:35:11.961 --> 00:35:16.961
<v Speaker 2>suddenly we have all these industries </v>
<v Speaker 2>created to basically target children as </v>

683
00:35:16.961 --> 00:35:18.830
<v Speaker 2>customers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think about it,</v>

684
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:23.930
<v Speaker 2>nobody's drinking cold drinks at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So refrigeration,</v>

685
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:29.200
<v Speaker 2>refrigeration until the 19 thirties and </v>
<v Speaker 2>no vending machines until the 19 </v>

686
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.400
<v Speaker 2>thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love this because I'm a science guy,</v>

687
00:35:31.401 --> 00:35:36.401
<v Speaker 2>but in doing my books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to become a historian and you </v>

688
00:35:36.401 --> 00:35:36.401
<v Speaker 2>just don't think about this stuff.</v>

689
00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.620
<v Speaker 2>So with the vending machines and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>refrigerators,</v>

690
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:43.950
<v Speaker 2>suddenly Coca Cola and Pepsico and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>start targeting,</v>

691
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:49.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start getting a six packs and the </v>

692
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:53.120
<v Speaker 2>cartons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cases of sodas and big bottles of soda </v>

693
00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.661
<v Speaker 2>that you could take home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put in your refrigerator and drink all </v>

694
00:35:56.661 --> 00:35:56.661
<v Speaker 2>day long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't do it before that,</v>

695
00:35:56.661 --> 00:35:59.040
<v Speaker 2>couldn't get ice cubes easily before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you couldn't even,</v>

696
00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:01.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote down in the summer,</v>

697
00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:06.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fruit juices come in in the 19 thirties,</v>

698
00:36:06.301 --> 00:36:09.480
<v Speaker 2>a California orange growers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one,</v>

699
00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:14.481
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's one of the people think </v>

700
00:36:14.481 --> 00:36:14.481
<v Speaker 2>is totally innocuous and actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy.</v>

701
00:36:14.481 --> 00:36:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's got all that vitamin C,</v>

702
00:36:14.971 --> 00:36:19.971
<v Speaker 2>which is explaining to people right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you're drinking a big glass of </v>

703
00:36:19.971 --> 00:36:23.181
<v Speaker 2>orange juice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might as well be drinking a pepsi </v>

704
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:23.181
<v Speaker 2>effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I believe.</v>

705
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:27.201
<v Speaker 2>So those are the two b.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got these complete putting </v>

706
00:36:27.201 --> 00:36:27.201
<v Speaker 2>nutritional paradigms.</v>

707
00:36:27.201 --> 00:36:28.040
<v Speaker 2>One says if it's got vitamins and </v>
<v Speaker 2>minerals in a telephone,</v>

708
00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a pepsi with vitamins and minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a pepsi with vitamins and minerals,</v>

709
00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:36.810
<v Speaker 2>take a vitamin pill and then drink a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pepsi and it's the same goddamn </v>

710
00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:36.810
<v Speaker 2>effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

711
00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:38.660
<v Speaker 2>it's so crazy to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always thought like,</v>

712
00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.650
<v Speaker 2>what's fresh squeezed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got Paul Pinot.</v>

713
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is when.</v>

714
00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:46.540
<v Speaker 2>So the California Orange Growers Forum </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunkist that was a consortium of </v>

715
00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.340
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had all these extra oranges,</v>

716
00:36:47.341 --> 00:36:52.341
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't sell at oranges are all </v>
<v Speaker 2>come and you coming along in one season.</v>

717
00:36:52.801 --> 00:36:55.260
<v Speaker 2>So back then without refrigeration and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars,</v>

718
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:58.350
<v Speaker 2>he could keep fruits kind of alive for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a year.</v>

719
00:36:58.351 --> 00:36:59.910
<v Speaker 2>By freezing them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

720
00:36:59.911 --> 00:37:01.800
<v Speaker 2>you had all these extra oranges you </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't sell.</v>

721
00:37:01.801 --> 00:37:06.750
<v Speaker 2>So they said let's get people to turn </v>
<v Speaker 2>into orange juice and we'll advertise at</v>

722
00:37:06.751 --> 00:37:11.060
<v Speaker 2>the vitamin C is good for the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition of the 19 twenties in 1930.</v>

723
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:16.070
<v Speaker 2>It was all about vitamin deficiency </v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases and so scurvy is caused by the </v>

724
00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:19.240
<v Speaker 2>absence of vitamin C and Barry Barry by </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin B and that,</v>

725
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.280
<v Speaker 2>that was the big news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the orange growers started pushing </v>

726
00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:24.660
<v Speaker 2>orange juice sawdust because it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C content.</v>

727
00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:30.380
<v Speaker 2>So now we're drinking fruit juices for </v>
<v Speaker 2>breakfast everyday and then post World </v>

728
00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.180
<v Speaker 2>War Two concentrates are created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was actually a defense,</v>

729
00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:38.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>World War II program to try and figure </v>

730
00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.911
<v Speaker 2>out how to create foods that soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 2>could take into battle and get their </v>

731
00:37:40.911 --> 00:37:43.770
<v Speaker 2>vitamins from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that comes along.</v>

732
00:37:43.771 --> 00:37:48.771
<v Speaker 2>And then the last one is sugary cereals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the scenario in the street was </v>

733
00:37:48.771 --> 00:37:51.660
<v Speaker 2>created by um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compost and Kellogg who are health nuts.</v>

734
00:37:51.661 --> 00:37:54.510
<v Speaker 2>They ran sanatoriums and Minnesota,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

735
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:59.430
<v Speaker 2>And they knew their health nutritionist </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to put sugar in anything.</v>

736
00:37:59.431 --> 00:38:01.540
<v Speaker 2>They had some huge fights over this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

737
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:07.950
<v Speaker 2>but 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>48 post release sugar crisps some.</v>

738
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.250
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

739
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:11.530
<v Speaker 2>30 percent sugar by calories or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

740
00:38:11.531 --> 00:38:16.531
<v Speaker 2>That's the first sugar coated cereal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for the next decade you can watch </v>

741
00:38:16.531 --> 00:38:20.210
<v Speaker 2>the cereal industries have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>internal battles where the marketing </v>

742
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:20.550
<v Speaker 2>people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need a sugar sweetened cereal.</v>

743
00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:25.660
<v Speaker 2>We've got to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be run out of the </v>

744
00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:25.660
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the health people are saying,</v>

745
00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:26.220
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no sugar is bad for you.</v>

746
00:38:26.221 --> 00:38:30.570
<v Speaker 2>And in every case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the marketers one by the 19 sixties,</v>

747
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:35.600
<v Speaker 2>not only do you have like all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these scenarios were 50 percent </v>

748
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 2>sugar by calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still are,</v>

749
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:41.730
<v Speaker 2>but you've got all these iconic TV shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were created just to sell sugar </v>

750
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.590
<v Speaker 2>cereals too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean rocky and bullwinkle,</v>

751
00:38:44.591 --> 00:38:46.540
<v Speaker 2>which is my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was heartbreaking.</v>

752
00:38:46.541 --> 00:38:49.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean those guys were created to sell </v>
<v Speaker 2>cereal to the women,</v>

753
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.520
<v Speaker 2>the comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comic,</v>

754
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:56.550
<v Speaker 2>the TV show that was created as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vehicle to market.</v>

755
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:59.950
<v Speaker 2>I forget which cereal it was which </v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

756
00:38:59.951 --> 00:39:01.250
<v Speaker 2>but all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

757
00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:03.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cartoon was an afterthought.</v>

758
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.870
<v Speaker 2>The cartoon was a method to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

759
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:11.350
<v Speaker 2>the cereal industry would hire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

760
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:16.380
<v Speaker 2>these brilliant public relations men who</v>
<v Speaker 2>would create these characters and then </v>

761
00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:20.800
<v Speaker 2>get Hollywood to create animated tv </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows with these characters.</v>

762
00:39:20.801 --> 00:39:24.340
<v Speaker 2>And then they would always sell the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar sweetened cereals.</v>

763
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now we're just,</v>

764
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:28.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think what happened to kids.</v>

765
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:34.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the obese and diabetic people in the </v>

766
00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:34.870
<v Speaker 2>world are the ones who started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all started as children,</v>

767
00:39:34.871 --> 00:39:38.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

768
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:39.450
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh five,</v>

769
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.090
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

770
00:39:40.091 --> 00:39:43.000
<v Speaker 2>updating 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they see sugar once a week,</v>

771
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they still went to the country store and</v>

772
00:39:45.941 --> 00:39:50.941
<v Speaker 2>when Uncle Ed is turned the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stick their hand in the sugar </v>

773
00:39:50.941 --> 00:39:53.950
<v Speaker 2>barrow and lick their fingers and alc by</v>
<v Speaker 2>1960.</v>

774
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:58.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like orange juice cereal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

775
00:39:58.031 --> 00:40:03.031
<v Speaker 2>sugary cereal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar on the sugary cereal for </v>

776
00:40:03.031 --> 00:40:03.031
<v Speaker 2>breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

777
00:40:03.031 --> 00:40:06.070
<v Speaker 2>a coke for a snack and candy bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same kind of foods for lunch.</v>

778
00:40:06.071 --> 00:40:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet most Americans didn't go more than</v>

779
00:40:08.891 --> 00:40:13.891
<v Speaker 2>three hours without a sugar dose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas 150 years earlier they'd had </v>

780
00:40:14.471 --> 00:40:19.471
<v Speaker 2>gone a week between doses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as this happens,</v>

781
00:40:19.481 --> 00:40:24.481
<v Speaker 2>you see these explosions and obesity and</v>
<v Speaker 2>diabetes that they're slow to build and </v>

782
00:40:25.361 --> 00:40:30.361
<v Speaker 2>I think I could eat that can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>explained to by the fact that mothers </v>

783
00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:31.990
<v Speaker 2>pass this on to their kids when the kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>are in the wound.</v>

784
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.240
<v Speaker 2>Is there a difference in how much of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference is there,</v>

785
00:40:34.241 --> 00:40:35.900
<v Speaker 2>if any between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

786
00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.920
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dietary diabetes or diet diabetes is </v>

787
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.380
<v Speaker 2>directly attributed to diet and genetic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

788
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:43.720
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are different.</v>

789
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:44.920
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are different types,</v>

790
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:49.950
<v Speaker 2>type one diabetes type one type one is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the acute form that hits mostly in </v>

791
00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:51.040
<v Speaker 2>childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

792
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.740
<v Speaker 2>and has a strong genetic component.</v>

793
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:57.780
<v Speaker 2>It's an auto immune disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean it's not </v>

794
00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.930
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally caused by sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by that I mean if we didn't never </v>

795
00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:04.051
<v Speaker 2>get around to eating sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't have type one diabetes and </v>

796
00:41:04.051 --> 00:41:06.880
<v Speaker 2>that really woke people that think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>type one diabetes,</v>

797
00:41:06.881 --> 00:41:11.680
<v Speaker 2>which is something that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people I know have and well,</v>

798
00:41:11.681 --> 00:41:14.170
<v Speaker 2>it's just genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just something you were born with.</v>

799
00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.050
<v Speaker 2>That's not necessarily true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

800
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:19.660
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't be born with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

801
00:41:19.661 --> 00:41:21.190
<v Speaker 2>it could be an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be genetic,</v>

802
00:41:21.191 --> 00:41:26.191
<v Speaker 2>but it still has to be triggered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be triggered by something in the </v>

803
00:41:26.191 --> 00:41:29.851
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these people with type one diabetes </v>

804
00:41:29.851 --> 00:41:30.550
<v Speaker 2>didn't have a poor diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't consume sugar,</v>

805
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:34.790
<v Speaker 2>didn't eat the average American diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>would never itself their mothers.</v>

806
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Maybe even more importantly in the womb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the womb.</v>

807
00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>

808
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:44.950
<v Speaker 2>The third to last chapter of my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lead to,</v>

809
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:51.371
<v Speaker 2>of the last three chapters before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>epilogue is called are called the if </v>

810
00:41:51.371 --> 00:41:51.371
<v Speaker 2>then problems.</v>

811
00:41:51.371 --> 00:41:53.030
<v Speaker 2>So let me lay out what I'm proposing </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

812
00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.940
<v Speaker 2>The case against sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the.</v>

813
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.140
<v Speaker 2>So the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a crime,</v>

814
00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.520
<v Speaker 2>I think of it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

815
00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:03.550
<v Speaker 2>we're in a courtroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a courtroom and there's a crime that's </v>

816
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:07.091
<v Speaker 2>committed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crime is epidemics of obesity and </v>

817
00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:09.491
<v Speaker 2>diabetes that happened whenever a </v>
<v Speaker 2>population transitions from their </v>

818
00:42:09.491 --> 00:42:11.570
<v Speaker 2>traditional diet to a western diet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle.</v>

819
00:42:11.571 --> 00:42:13.280
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't matter what the population</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

820
00:42:13.281 --> 00:42:16.350
<v Speaker 2>it can be the inuits living on like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Caribou and cme.</v>

821
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.670
<v Speaker 2>They could be Mussai living on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood,</v>

822
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:22.010
<v Speaker 2>milk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat from the cattle they heard.</v>

823
00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:27.020
<v Speaker 2>That could be agrarian populations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be south Pacific islanders </v>

824
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.640
<v Speaker 2>living on coconuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

825
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:32.300
<v Speaker 2>pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm aborigines in Australia,</v>

826
00:42:32.301 --> 00:42:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Middle Eastern populations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>African populations,</v>

827
00:42:34.851 --> 00:42:37.400
<v Speaker 2>European populations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does not matter.</v>

828
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Eventually they transition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see these epidemics of recent </v>

829
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:44.210
<v Speaker 2>diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the crime.</v>

830
00:42:44.211 --> 00:42:47.750
<v Speaker 2>So the argument I'm making is that sugar</v>
<v Speaker 2>is always at the scene of the crime in a</v>

831
00:42:47.751 --> 00:42:48.980
<v Speaker 2>population wide level.</v>

832
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.610
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of things that happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you transitioned to western diets.</v>

833
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:55.130
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of populations eat more meat,</v>

834
00:42:55.850 --> 00:43:00.850
<v Speaker 2>but some populations like the inuits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't eat more me because they </v>

835
00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:03.860
<v Speaker 2>reading or the native Americans of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plains Indians,</v>

836
00:43:03.861 --> 00:43:06.170
<v Speaker 2>they don't eat more meat because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were living on me to begin with,</v>

837
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.670
<v Speaker 2>but they also get obesity and diabetes </v>
<v Speaker 2>epidemics.</v>

838
00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:14.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to rule out meat on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>level and other people did as well.</v>

839
00:43:14.631 --> 00:43:19.631
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they become more sedentary when you're </v>

840
00:43:19.631 --> 00:43:19.631
<v Speaker 2>Westernized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get more labor saving devices,</v>

841
00:43:19.631 --> 00:43:21.050
<v Speaker 2>you dry places instead of walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>

842
00:43:21.051 --> 00:43:26.051
<v Speaker 2>So maybe it's sedentary behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could find populations that are </v>

843
00:43:26.051 --> 00:43:26.380
<v Speaker 2>incredibly physically active.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

844
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:32.470
<v Speaker 2>cane cut it there a in the natal region </v>
<v Speaker 2>of South Africa in the 18th century,</v>

845
00:43:33.201 --> 00:43:38.201
<v Speaker 2>they used to import a in the Indians </v>
<v Speaker 2>from India as indentured slaves,</v>

846
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:44.290
<v Speaker 2>indentured laborers effectively slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they call them indentured laborers </v>

847
00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:48.221
<v Speaker 2>to work in the sugar plantations and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cane cutters in the sugar plantations.</v>

848
00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:53.310
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the most energy intense </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs you can imagine than one estimate </v>

849
00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:54.470
<v Speaker 2>was they burned 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>calories a day.</v>

850
00:43:55.130 --> 00:44:00.130
<v Speaker 2>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these in the town Indians had among the </v>

851
00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:01.700
<v Speaker 2>highest rates of diabetes ever seen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ancestors,</v>

852
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:05.120
<v Speaker 2>the population from which they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>drawn in India,</v>

853
00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:10.121
<v Speaker 2>had virtually no diabetes and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>primary difference in their diet was a </v>

854
00:44:10.121 --> 00:44:13.991
<v Speaker 2>sugar consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could play this game where you </v>

855
00:44:13.991 --> 00:44:15.230
<v Speaker 2>isolate out populations and what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>find.</v>

856
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:20.290
<v Speaker 2>What I found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is no population when you get an </v>

857
00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:22.511
<v Speaker 2>obesity and diabetes epidemic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where sugar recent increases in sugar </v>

858
00:44:22.511 --> 00:44:26.080
<v Speaker 2>consumption habit occurred and by recent</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be 20 years ago,</v>

859
00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:31.100
<v Speaker 2>could be 50 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's always at the scene of the </v>

860
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:31.100
<v Speaker 2>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

861
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:36.560
<v Speaker 2>type two diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the common form that associates with </v>

862
00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:36.980
<v Speaker 2>excess weight is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

863
00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:42.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fundamentally the sort of what's </v>

864
00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:42.580
<v Speaker 2>called insulin resistance.</v>

865
00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:42.580
<v Speaker 2>So type one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

866
00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.460
<v Speaker 2>your pancreas doesn't secrete enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>insulin.</v>

867
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Type two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body is resistant to the insulin </v>

868
00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:51.500
<v Speaker 2>that your pancreas secretes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you gotTa pump,</v>

869
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:54.930
<v Speaker 2>you've got to secrete more and more to </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep your blood sugar under control.</v>

870
00:44:54.931 --> 00:44:59.931
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is eventually your pancreas</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets exhausted and the can't do it </v>

871
00:44:59.931 --> 00:45:04.431
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have a deficit of insulin </v>

872
00:45:04.431 --> 00:45:06.511
<v Speaker 2>and it looks like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The results were pretty much similar to </v>

873
00:45:06.511 --> 00:45:09.111
<v Speaker 2>type one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So insulin resistance is also very </v>

874
00:45:10.531 --> 00:45:14.070
<v Speaker 2>closely associated to obesity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we could discuss that as well.</v>

875
00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could look at these epidemics of </v>

876
00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:19.240
<v Speaker 2>obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diabetes,</v>

877
00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:19.830
<v Speaker 2>heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>

878
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dementia basically is manifestations of </v>

879
00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.251
<v Speaker 2>insulin resistance happening all around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world in different ways and </v>

880
00:45:28.251 --> 00:45:32.601
<v Speaker 2>different people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're all related to insulin </v>

881
00:45:32.601 --> 00:45:33.120
<v Speaker 2>resistance and insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you ask yourself,</v>

882
00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:38.121
<v Speaker 2>well causes the insulin resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the best researchers in the world who</v>

883
00:45:38.521 --> 00:45:42.120
<v Speaker 2>study insulin resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leading hypothesis is that it starts</v>

884
00:45:42.121 --> 00:45:46.350
<v Speaker 2>in the liver and it starts in the liver </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the conversion,</v>

885
00:45:46.351 --> 00:45:49.170
<v Speaker 2>with the accumulation of fats and liver </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells.</v>

886
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:54.440
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we also have an epidemic of what's </v>

887
00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.271
<v Speaker 2>called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country right now used to be 20 </v>

888
00:45:56.271 --> 00:45:57.780
<v Speaker 2>slash 30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm.</v>

889
00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:04.130
<v Speaker 2>If you've got fatty liver disease and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw your doctor and you told them </v>

890
00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:07.311
<v Speaker 2>you didn't drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would just assume you're lying </v>

891
00:46:07.311 --> 00:46:08.370
<v Speaker 2>because they clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alcoholics got fatty liver disease.</v>

892
00:46:08.371 --> 00:46:11.700
<v Speaker 2>But suddenly people started showing up </v>
<v Speaker 2>who swore they didn't drink,</v>

893
00:46:11.701 --> 00:46:16.701
<v Speaker 2>and then kids started showing up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatty liver disease who clearly didn't </v>

894
00:46:16.701 --> 00:46:20.421
<v Speaker 2>drink alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we got this concept nonalcoholic </v>

895
00:46:20.421 --> 00:46:24.381
<v Speaker 2>fatty liver disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically indistinguishable from </v>

896
00:46:24.381 --> 00:46:27.201
<v Speaker 2>the alcoholic kind and it's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The CDC estimates 40 million Americans </v>

897
00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:29.670
<v Speaker 2>have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it progresses,</v>

898
00:46:29.671 --> 00:46:34.671
<v Speaker 2>it can progress to what's called Nash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not alcoholics stereo </v>

899
00:46:34.671 --> 00:46:39.531
<v Speaker 2>hepatitis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eventually the need for liver </v>

900
00:46:39.531 --> 00:46:44.451
<v Speaker 2>transplant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Sugar Christ.</v>

901
00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Now I know like what are we talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about when we're talking about sugar?</v>

902
00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:52.971
<v Speaker 2>So sugar cane sugar beet sugar are </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically sucrose.</v>

903
00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:56.040
<v Speaker 2>That's a molecule of glucose bonded to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>molecule.</v>

904
00:46:56.041 --> 00:46:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Fructose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fructose makes it sweet.</v>

905
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:05.070
<v Speaker 2>High Fructose Corn Syrup is 45 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose,</v>

906
00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:08.460
<v Speaker 2>55 percent fructose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same chemical constituents.</v>

907
00:47:08.461 --> 00:47:13.461
<v Speaker 2>They're not bonded together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that makes a damn bit of </v>

908
00:47:13.461 --> 00:47:13.461
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people do.</v>

909
00:47:13.461 --> 00:47:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fructose is metabolized in your </v>

910
00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:21.231
<v Speaker 2>liver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the glucose gets into your </v>

911
00:47:21.231 --> 00:47:22.911
<v Speaker 2>bloodstream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like any other glucose from any </v>

912
00:47:22.911 --> 00:47:25.560
<v Speaker 2>other carbohydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fructose goes to your liver and your</v>

913
00:47:25.561 --> 00:47:30.561
<v Speaker 2>liver gets it in a high dose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say from an apple juice or </v>

914
00:47:30.561 --> 00:47:33.681
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has trouble dealing with that much </v>

915
00:47:33.681 --> 00:47:37.981
<v Speaker 2>fructose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never evolved to see a glass of </v>

916
00:47:37.981 --> 00:47:40.540
<v Speaker 2>apple juice for glass can of cokes worth</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fructose be delivered over the course</v>

917
00:47:40.541 --> 00:47:41.680
<v Speaker 2>of five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes,</v>

918
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:45.040
<v Speaker 2>probably even 30 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it converted into fat.</v>

919
00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:51.180
<v Speaker 2>So we have a condition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insulin resistant that's epidemic </v>

920
00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:53.761
<v Speaker 2>worldwide that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leading research in the country </v>

921
00:47:53.761 --> 00:47:58.081
<v Speaker 2>think is caused by the accumulation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat in liver cells and we've got a </v>

922
00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:04.320
<v Speaker 2>substance sugar that's been exploded in </v>
<v Speaker 2>use worldwide in which half of it is </v>

923
00:48:05.111 --> 00:48:09.670
<v Speaker 2>metabolized in the liver and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>converted into fat and liver cells.</v>

924
00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:15.360
<v Speaker 2>So it's like it's at the scene of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crime in populations and set the scene </v>

925
00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:19.171
<v Speaker 2>of the crime in a body and it's got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism.</v>

926
00:48:20.531 --> 00:48:24.250
<v Speaker 2>It's got the gun necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

927
00:48:24.251 --> 00:48:27.760
<v Speaker 2>you can match the bullets almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have the smoking gun.</v>

928
00:48:27.761 --> 00:48:29.540
<v Speaker 2>That's where the research falls short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

929
00:48:29.541 --> 00:48:33.730
<v Speaker 2>so this is the case I'm making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then if sugar causes insulin resistance,</v>

930
00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:39.650
<v Speaker 2>there are all kinds of downstream </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects including what mothers will do </v>

931
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.040
<v Speaker 2>to their children if they are insulin </v>
<v Speaker 2>resistant and have high blood sugar when</v>

932
00:48:42.041 --> 00:48:42.670
<v Speaker 2>they're pregnant.</v>

933
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

934
00:48:47.021 --> 00:48:48.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why my argument is,</v>

935
00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:50.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost too much.</v>

936
00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:55.440
<v Speaker 2>It would be easier if I just said it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>empty calories because you know what,</v>

937
00:48:55.911 --> 00:48:58.690
<v Speaker 2>what back against your book and against </v>
<v Speaker 2>your research,</v>

938
00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:00.070
<v Speaker 2>have you experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

939
00:49:00.071 --> 00:49:05.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people who just object to my </v>

940
00:49:05.071 --> 00:49:05.200
<v Speaker 2>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you debated these people?</v>

941
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the process of debating to have </v>

942
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:12.760
<v Speaker 2>them online now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The keto in Keto,</v>

943
00:49:12.761 --> 00:49:13.810
<v Speaker 2>one bound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called.</v>

944
00:49:13.811 --> 00:49:14.610
<v Speaker 2>I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

945
00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:15.640
<v Speaker 2>done this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm,</v>

946
00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:21.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of debates in science </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think they settled </v>

947
00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:23.971
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fans of people getting together </v>

948
00:49:23.971 --> 00:49:23.971
<v Speaker 2>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

949
00:49:23.971 --> 00:49:23.971
<v Speaker 2>you believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe this.</v>

950
00:49:23.971 --> 00:49:26.040
<v Speaker 2>What experiment can we do to find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's not,</v>

951
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:27.520
<v Speaker 2>who's the better rider?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

952
00:49:27.521 --> 00:49:30.430
<v Speaker 2>read a rhetorician I know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

953
00:49:30.431 --> 00:49:35.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was more charismatic point across </v>

954
00:49:35.431 --> 00:49:35.431
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

955
00:49:35.431 --> 00:49:36.820
<v Speaker 2>it's just that pallet in the obesity </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

956
00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:37.330
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

957
00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nutrition society's once a year </v>

958
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:43.930
<v Speaker 2>they'll have their annual conference </v>
<v Speaker 2>alva debate over this and everybody,</v>

959
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you did better,</v>

960
00:49:45.131 --> 00:49:47.140
<v Speaker 2>but nobody walks out of the debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

961
00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:49.450
<v Speaker 2>what experiment can we do to settle </v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

962
00:49:49.451 --> 00:49:51.550
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get me to have these epidemics</v>

963
00:49:51.551 --> 00:49:56.551
<v Speaker 2>are tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cost of obesity and diabetes in the </v>

964
00:49:56.551 --> 00:49:59.881
<v Speaker 2>US direct cost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the medical systems estimate is </v>

965
00:49:59.881 --> 00:49:59.881
<v Speaker 2>$2,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>

966
00:49:59.881 --> 00:50:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

967
00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:05.220
<v Speaker 2>a billion dollars a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What light direct cost to the healthcare</v>

968
00:50:06.611 --> 00:50:08.830
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three hundred $65 million dollars a year</v>

969
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:12.180
<v Speaker 2>just because of obesity and diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

970
00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:15.570
<v Speaker 2>And if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's $365,000,000,000.</v>

971
00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.910
<v Speaker 2>It is a direct cost to the tax burden on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the healthcare system,</v>

972
00:50:18.911 --> 00:50:22.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's a tremendous for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical industry,</v>

973
00:50:22.451 --> 00:50:24.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the physicians and the hospitals that</v>

974
00:50:24.581 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 2>are getting that money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they don't have quite much motivation</v>

975
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.890
<v Speaker 3>as might to stem this tide because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're profiting</v>

976
00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:35.430
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they even aware of the causes of it?</v>

977
00:50:35.431 --> 00:50:40.431
<v Speaker 1>If your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your work is so controversial and </v>

978
00:50:40.431 --> 00:50:43.821
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are disputing it or disputing this link </v>

979
00:50:43.821 --> 00:50:47.600
<v Speaker 1>between sugar and all these horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases and they're calling it empty </v>

980
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.631
<v Speaker 1>calories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this even something that in the </v>

981
00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:52.941
<v Speaker 1>medical community where they spend a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously short amount of time in </v>

982
00:50:52.941 --> 00:50:53.960
<v Speaker 1>school learning about nutrition and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

983
00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:55.770
<v Speaker 1>thank God for that because if they learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

984
00:50:55.771 --> 00:50:57.140
<v Speaker 1>they would learn the wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

985
00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Then they'd be dogmatic point now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well these people,</v>

986
00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:04.470
<v Speaker 1>they don't really have the information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

987
00:51:04.471 --> 00:51:05.610
<v Speaker 1>you can go ahead and blow your nose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

988
00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been struggling with it for </v>

989
00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.840
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had gary sick because he hasn't had </v>

990
00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:12.840
<v Speaker 1>enough sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen.</v>

991
00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

992
00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

993
00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:19.800
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me like they don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

994
00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the time to do the research</v>

995
00:51:22.291 --> 00:51:23.910
<v Speaker 1>that you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A very few people do.</v>

996
00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:27.560
<v Speaker 1>It really takes someone like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a maniac to go out there and,</v>

997
00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:32.640
<v Speaker 1>and stretch your finances and put </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in a bad position to and really</v>

998
00:51:33.031 --> 00:51:34.860
<v Speaker 1>be obsessive chasing this down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

999
00:51:34.861 --> 00:51:35.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

1000
00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:40.730
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean that you're supposed </v>

1001
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:40.730
<v Speaker 3>to believe somebody like me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1002
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:40.730
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1003
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:41.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to think,</v>

1004
00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:48.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagined some plumber came up to me one </v>

1005
00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:48.310
<v Speaker 3>day and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1006
00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:52.911
<v Speaker 3>I just spent like the last 10 years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>my life studying how to do termism and </v>

1007
00:51:53.551 --> 00:51:56.210
<v Speaker 3>I've written this book and you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it all wrong.</v>

1008
00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:58.850
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1009
00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:00.210
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1010
00:52:00.211 --> 00:52:00.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

1011
00:52:00.721 --> 00:52:02.010
<v Speaker 3>I'll take the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1012
00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:07.520
<v Speaker 3>and I can't wait to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I'm going to go home and I'm not </v>

1013
00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:10.730
<v Speaker 3>probably going to throw the book out </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the odds that that's a waste of </v>

1014
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:12.090
<v Speaker 3>time for me are enormous.</v>

1015
00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:17.620
<v Speaker 1>When one was the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did diabetes first sort of emerge </v>

1016
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:21.830
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in medical records?</v>

1017
00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Medical records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said</v>

1018
00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:26.350
<v Speaker 3>2000 years ago when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Hindu medical documents,</v>

1019
00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:30.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coincidentally with the beginning of the</v>

1020
00:52:30.071 --> 00:52:32.440
<v Speaker 3>sugar industry in northern India.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1021
00:52:32.441 --> 00:52:35.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean just give or take 200 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1022
00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:36.510
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1023
00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:39.920
<v Speaker 3>and even back then they speculate that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was caused by sugar.</v>

1024
00:52:39.921 --> 00:52:44.921
<v Speaker 3>Although I think for the wrong reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the diabetic urine and you're </v>

1025
00:52:44.921 --> 00:52:45.040
<v Speaker 3>pissing out a lot of glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1026
00:52:45.041 --> 00:52:47.440
<v Speaker 3>because your body can't handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's Sweden,</v>

1027
00:52:47.441 --> 00:52:52.441
<v Speaker 3>it'll attract flies and back then even </v>
<v Speaker 3>up until a 17th century,</v>

1028
00:52:52.571 --> 00:52:57.571
<v Speaker 3>part of classic medical practice was for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the physician to have his assistant </v>

1029
00:52:57.571 --> 00:52:58.590
<v Speaker 3>taste the urine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't.</v>

1030
00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.060
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have to do it himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>

1031
00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:01.660
<v Speaker 3>And that could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1032
00:53:01.661 --> 00:53:04.360
<v Speaker 3>one reason why a lot of diabetes went </v>
<v Speaker 3>undiagnosed.</v>

1033
00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:07.390
<v Speaker 3>People wouldn't drink the as people </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't drink the pis.</v>

1034
00:53:07.391 --> 00:53:08.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1035
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.210
<v Speaker 3>and you got to keep all this stuff in </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

1036
00:53:10.211 --> 00:53:14.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a ridiculous way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All they had,</v>

1037
00:53:14.051 --> 00:53:19.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>science is determined by the technology </v>

1038
00:53:19.051 --> 00:53:22.021
<v Speaker 3>available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the lessons that we can </v>

1039
00:53:22.021 --> 00:53:23.851
<v Speaker 3>get into this because all my books are </v>
<v Speaker 3>about good science and bad science that </v>

1040
00:53:23.851 --> 00:53:24.040
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope I understand what I'm doing.</v>

1041
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.820
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

1042
00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:28.500
<v Speaker 4>know if I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really bad.</v>

1043
00:53:28.501 --> 00:53:29.860
<v Speaker 4>It's embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1044
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:32.010
<v Speaker 4>I wake up at three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four in the morning and thinking,</v>

1045
00:53:32.011 --> 00:53:34.740
<v Speaker 4>why do I so obsessed about this calorie </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue?</v>

1046
00:53:34.741 --> 00:53:37.560
<v Speaker 4>Nobody else seems to care,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people do now,</v>

1047
00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:42.590
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you feel that we live in a very </v>

1048
00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:42.590
<v Speaker 4>small world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1049
00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:45.750
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean even with your whatever,</v>

1050
00:53:45.751 --> 00:53:49.140
<v Speaker 4>20 million downloads a month that all </v>
<v Speaker 4>your followers is not more than that.</v>

1051
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:54.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean think about how many of those </v>

1052
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.470
<v Speaker 4>voted for the current president for </v>
<v Speaker 4>instance.</v>

1053
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:55.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very.</v>

1054
00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:59.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad to hear it's a lot more because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get this out,</v>

1055
00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:04.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean even if it's just for this one </v>

1056
00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.621
<v Speaker 4>particular subject,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is probably the most </v>

1057
00:54:06.621 --> 00:54:08.931
<v Speaker 4>important subject today when in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 4>health and wellness and just optimizing </v>

1058
00:54:09.781 --> 00:54:13.770
<v Speaker 4>your existence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cutting out sugar and changing your diet</v>

1059
00:54:13.771 --> 00:54:17.760
<v Speaker 4>I think is one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 4>factors and living a healthier,</v>

1060
00:54:17.761 --> 00:54:20.750
<v Speaker 4>more productive life and also mental </v>
<v Speaker 4>clarity.</v>

1061
00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.250
<v Speaker 4>Well now let me ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you cut out sugar,</v>

1062
00:54:23.251 --> 00:54:27.870
<v Speaker 4>so you said you cut it out slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What were you eating at the time?</v>

1063
00:54:27.871 --> 00:54:32.871
<v Speaker 4>Because I gather I'd never ate bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The but I pastas and bread I eat.</v>

1064
00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:38.570
<v Speaker 4>I always supplemented with vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always worked out hard and I was </v>

1065
00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:39.270
<v Speaker 4>always lean because I worked out so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much,</v>

1066
00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:44.330
<v Speaker 4>so I never thought I had an issue with </v>
<v Speaker 4>fat or I never thought I had an issue </v>

1067
00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:45.810
<v Speaker 4>with any of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would get that crash.</v>

1068
00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:49.370
<v Speaker 4>I would did that in late afternoon crash</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this fucking insulin dump.</v>

1069
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:50.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to say,</v>

1070
00:54:50.671 --> 00:54:55.671
<v Speaker 4>I say I don't take naps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They take me like an hour after lunch </v>

1071
00:54:56.071 --> 00:54:57.870
<v Speaker 4>and I'd be interviewing some Nobel </v>
<v Speaker 4>prize.</v>

1072
00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:02.430
<v Speaker 4>What I'd have to think of an excuse to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get off because I was falling asleep.</v>

1073
00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.340
<v Speaker 4>Do you mean that doesn't happen to me </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore?</v>

1074
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:06.390
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fascinating.</v>

1075
00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:09.570
<v Speaker 4>It's unbelievably fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would never have guessed.</v>

1076
00:55:09.571 --> 00:55:14.571
<v Speaker 4>I would've thought you needed some sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of stimulant to keep you going like </v>

1077
00:55:14.571 --> 00:55:14.571
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although in all honesty,</v>

1078
00:55:14.571 --> 00:55:15.730
<v Speaker 4>we were both drinking bulletproof </v>
<v Speaker 4>coffees right now,</v>

1079
00:55:15.731 --> 00:55:17.850
<v Speaker 4>so we are getting some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stimulant.</v>

1080
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:18.780
<v Speaker 4>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't.</v>

1081
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:20.670
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1082
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:22.680
<v Speaker 4>but that's the book tour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1083
00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:26.160
<v Speaker 4>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you cut out the grains,</v>

1084
00:55:26.161 --> 00:55:27.060
<v Speaker 4>the bread,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pasta,</v>

1085
00:55:27.061 --> 00:55:28.770
<v Speaker 4>that's still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's glucose.</v>

1086
00:55:28.771 --> 00:55:33.060
<v Speaker 4>So were you eating sugar?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're drinking gatorade very rarely,</v>

1087
00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:36.060
<v Speaker 4>very rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was still eating pretty clean,</v>

1088
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:38.940
<v Speaker 4>like I would have dessert every now and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

1089
00:55:38.941 --> 00:55:40.810
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't more than a few times a </v>
<v Speaker 4>week.</v>

1090
00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:42.720
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't eating candy bars during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>

1091
00:55:42.721 --> 00:55:47.721
<v Speaker 4>but I was eating the occasional protein </v>
<v Speaker 4>bar that was loaded with sugar that I </v>

1092
00:55:47.721 --> 00:55:47.850
<v Speaker 4>didn't even think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I thought it was.</v>

1093
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:49.710
<v Speaker 4>Eating healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what gets me.</v>

1094
00:55:49.711 --> 00:55:51.960
<v Speaker 4>So once we got into this diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to this idea.</v>

1095
00:55:51.961 --> 00:55:55.200
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this was a second article I read,</v>

1096
00:55:55.201 --> 00:56:00.201
<v Speaker 4>so is there evidence to support this </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea we should be eating the low fat </v>

1097
00:56:00.201 --> 00:56:02.931
<v Speaker 4>diet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the second article I wrote and I </v>

1098
00:56:02.931 --> 00:56:05.541
<v Speaker 4>recreated the history of that and it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinating because once these people </v>

1099
00:56:05.541 --> 00:56:07.080
<v Speaker 4>got this idea that fat caused heart </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>

1100
00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:12.140
<v Speaker 4>So remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>science is determined by what you can </v>

1101
00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:14.151
<v Speaker 4>measure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the technology have tells you what </v>

1102
00:56:14.151 --> 00:56:14.151
<v Speaker 4>you can measure and what you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>measure,</v>

1103
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:19.870
<v Speaker 4>what you can ask questions about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then that gives you the answers and </v>

1104
00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:22.821
<v Speaker 4>if you're bad scientists forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's completely limited to the </v>

1105
00:56:22.821 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's an old joke in science</v>

1106
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.890
<v Speaker 3>called the drunk and the streetlight </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>

1107
00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:31.930
<v Speaker 3>do you ever hear about now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So guys walking down the street and he </v>

1108
00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:34.930
<v Speaker 3>comes upon a drawn coups crawling around</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his knees under a street light and he</v>

1109
00:56:34.931 --> 00:56:36.280
<v Speaker 3>says to the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

1110
00:56:36.281 --> 00:56:38.320
<v Speaker 3>And the guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking for my keys.</v>

1111
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:40.340
<v Speaker 3>And the guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so cisco,</v>

1112
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:42.670
<v Speaker 3>you lost them in the drunk goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where I lost them,</v>

1113
00:56:42.671 --> 00:56:45.810
<v Speaker 3>but this is where the light is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1114
00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:50.850
<v Speaker 3>So in science it's like what you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>measure is where the light is and you </v>

1115
00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:54.251
<v Speaker 3>got to remember that there's a universe </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there that you can't see yet </v>

1116
00:56:54.251 --> 00:56:54.850
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But most scientists,</v>

1117
00:56:54.851 --> 00:56:57.910
<v Speaker 3>most scientists don't realize that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just not good scientists.</v>

1118
00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:01.120
<v Speaker 3>So in the heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the light was on cholesterol.</v>

1119
00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:04.540
<v Speaker 3>That was at 1950 sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they could measure.</v>

1120
00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:07.510
<v Speaker 3>And they got this idea that it's caused </v>
<v Speaker 3>by dietary fat.</v>

1121
00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:11.890
<v Speaker 3>And because of that we just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1122
00:57:11.891 --> 00:57:16.891
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tested and tested this hypothesis </v>

1123
00:57:16.891 --> 00:57:19.621
<v Speaker 3>and kept being failed the test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't care because they </v>

1124
00:57:19.621 --> 00:57:22.621
<v Speaker 3>thought it had to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the 19 eighties we lock it in as </v>

1125
00:57:22.621 --> 00:57:26.680
<v Speaker 3>a dogma and now we have this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the healthy way to eat is a low fat diet</v>

1126
00:57:26.681 --> 00:57:31.270
<v Speaker 3>and you start making products where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>take the fat out of it and once you take</v>

1127
00:57:31.271 --> 00:57:34.030
<v Speaker 3>the fat out of something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't taste all that good.</v>

1128
00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:35.890
<v Speaker 3>Like yogurts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a classic example,</v>

1129
00:57:35.891 --> 00:57:40.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is fat and some modest amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of black posts.</v>

1130
00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:45.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if there's lactose in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and I should know this stuff because </v>

1131
00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:45.450
<v Speaker 3>then people say clearly you're not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutritionist,</v>

1132
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:49.900
<v Speaker 3>so they candy bars instead of eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>snickers bars,</v>

1133
00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:53.800
<v Speaker 3>which a high fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high sugar thing that we grew up on.</v>

1134
00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:59.250
<v Speaker 3>You create clif bars and nature's way </v>
<v Speaker 3>bars and all these low fat health food </v>

1135
00:57:59.651 --> 00:58:04.070
<v Speaker 3>bars that we think are healthy because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're low in fat.</v>

1136
00:58:04.071 --> 00:58:06.880
<v Speaker 3>They're loaded with carbs and they fill </v>
<v Speaker 3>them up with sugar.</v>

1137
00:58:06.881 --> 00:58:09.550
<v Speaker 3>And then to this day I'm wondering like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should I just let you know,</v>

1138
00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:13.720
<v Speaker 3>we have a drawer with these health food </v>
<v Speaker 3>bars at my wife.</v>

1139
00:58:13.721 --> 00:58:18.721
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the only parent in the family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my kids are in tortured by my food </v>

1140
00:58:18.721 --> 00:58:19.370
<v Speaker 3>beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1141
00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:24.570
<v Speaker 3>would they be healthier if they just ate</v>
<v Speaker 3>snickers bars like we did when we were </v>

1142
00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:25.360
<v Speaker 3>kids?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know what the answer is.</v>

1143
00:58:25.361 --> 00:58:27.130
<v Speaker 3>I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could argue it either way.</v>

1144
00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.490
<v Speaker 3>How could you argue it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That they would be healthier if they had</v>

1145
00:58:29.491 --> 00:58:30.970
<v Speaker 3>all that sugar?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1146
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.000
<v Speaker 3>they both have the sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you both like Lara bars versus </v>

1147
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.690
<v Speaker 3>those Lara bars?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really love those.</v>

1148
00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:40.270
<v Speaker 3>They taste good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're 19 fucking grams of sugar or</v>

1149
00:58:40.271 --> 00:58:45.271
<v Speaker 3>something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's only like the size of your </v>

1150
00:58:45.271 --> 00:58:45.271
<v Speaker 3>thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1151
00:58:45.271 --> 00:58:46.250
<v Speaker 3>So the basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the sugar content that</v>

1152
00:58:46.251 --> 00:58:50.140
<v Speaker 3>you can probably google it while we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about regular size snickers bar.</v>

1153
00:58:50.141 --> 00:58:53.140
<v Speaker 3>It's probably more than 19 grams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also got all that fat in it,</v>

1154
00:58:53.141 --> 00:58:55.630
<v Speaker 3>which will slow down the digestion of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sugar.</v>

1155
00:58:55.690 --> 00:59:00.690
<v Speaker 3>So a snickers bar arguably is better for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you than some of these really super </v>

1156
00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:05.011
<v Speaker 3>sugary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we think air quotes are healthy </v>

1157
00:59:05.011 --> 00:59:05.260
<v Speaker 3>snacks like trail bars and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1158
00:59:05.261 --> 00:59:07.530
<v Speaker 3>and the key word there is arguably it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we go,</v>

1159
00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:09.180
<v Speaker 3>20 grams of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what does that.</v>

1160
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:10.990
<v Speaker 3>A snickers bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot.</v>

1161
00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:11.980
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ.</v>

1162
00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:12.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a bigger.</v>

1163
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:16.120
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be a big way more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what about the law of in a way more.</v>

1164
00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:18.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a 44 grams.</v>

1165
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:21.530
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1166
00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:25.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those things.</v>

1167
00:59:25.341 --> 00:59:27.260
<v Speaker 4>Lara bars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>St.</v>

1168
00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:29.330
<v Speaker 4>Find out what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is in those bad boys?</v>

1169
00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:32.270
<v Speaker 4>Because I had one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bought one once.</v>

1170
00:59:32.271 --> 00:59:35.690
<v Speaker 4>This is before I had gone on my crusade </v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar.</v>

1171
00:59:35.691 --> 00:59:39.790
<v Speaker 4>It says wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they're fruit and nut bars.</v>

1172
00:59:39.791 --> 00:59:42.680
<v Speaker 4>So the question is how much sugar are in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fruit?</v>

1173
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:45.350
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you're looking at the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's a different one.</v>

1174
00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:47.150
<v Speaker 4>Which one are you looking at here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1175
00:59:47.151 --> 00:59:48.980
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it say here?</v>

1176
00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:50.590
<v Speaker 4>How many grams?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty grams.</v>

1177
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:52.150
<v Speaker 4>Twenty grams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's the same as this.</v>

1178
00:59:52.170 --> 00:59:54.540
<v Speaker 4>So why the fuck are they lying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No added sugar.</v>

1179
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:58.370
<v Speaker 4>It could be because it comes from fruit </v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar.</v>

1180
00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.860
<v Speaker 4>Your body doesn't know that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing a Goddamn game.</v>

1181
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.090
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're playing a game.</v>

1182
01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:04.750
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say.</v>

1183
01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:08.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm just curious how fruits and nuts in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their bars.</v>

1184
01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:11.340
<v Speaker 4>World Health Organization's recommended </v>
<v Speaker 4>daily sugar intake for adults.</v>

1185
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:15.680
<v Speaker 4>Five percent of daily caloric intake for</v>
<v Speaker 4>normal weight adult eating 2000 calories</v>

1186
01:00:15.681 --> 01:00:15.860
<v Speaker 4>a day.</v>

1187
01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:20.860
<v Speaker 4>That's 25 grams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now is that added sugar per day?</v>

1188
01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:22.970
<v Speaker 4>I mean when you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>lactose,</v>

1189
01:00:22.971 --> 01:00:25.160
<v Speaker 4>when you talk to me about fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's funny,</v>

1190
01:00:25.161 --> 01:00:30.161
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a friend just sent me an article today </v>

1191
01:00:30.161 --> 01:00:32.561
<v Speaker 4>on a European Journal of clinical </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrition where they were looking at </v>

1192
01:00:32.561 --> 01:00:35.921
<v Speaker 4>sugar content of children's diets in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Europe and they age one,</v>

1193
01:00:36.921 --> 01:00:40.160
<v Speaker 4>they were 30 percent of their calories </v>
<v Speaker 4>from sugar Jesus Christ,</v>

1194
01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:44.980
<v Speaker 4>but just trying to make sense of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I pretty sure that included lactose free</v>

1195
01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:47.460
<v Speaker 4>milk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was a primary source.</v>

1196
01:00:47.461 --> 01:00:49.910
<v Speaker 4>He said the primary source of the sugar </v>
<v Speaker 4>with dairy products.</v>

1197
01:00:49.911 --> 01:00:51.920
<v Speaker 4>It could also be from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1198
01:00:51.921 --> 01:00:56.300
<v Speaker 4>a Bot artificial formulas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People take that in consideration,</v>

1199
01:00:56.301 --> 01:00:57.380
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you two pieces of cheese,</v>

1200
01:00:57.381 --> 01:00:59.060
<v Speaker 4>you're getting some sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1201
01:00:59.061 --> 01:01:01.880
<v Speaker 4>Although again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheese once you process it,</v>

1202
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:05.020
<v Speaker 4>process and lose the lactose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1203
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:07.420
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sort of.</v>

1204
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:11.000
<v Speaker 4>But even the lactose is metabolized </v>
<v Speaker 4>differently than the fructose.</v>

1205
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000
<v Speaker 4>So I would argue that we evolved to </v>
<v Speaker 4>consume lactose at least until we were </v>

1206
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.350
<v Speaker 4>out in weaning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Few,</v>

1207
01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:19.880
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four years old.</v>

1208
01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:21.620
<v Speaker 4>Drank milk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1209
01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.020
<v Speaker 4>I actually gave up their right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for different reasons,</v>

1210
01:01:24.021 --> 01:01:29.021
<v Speaker 4>not because I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me it has unfortunate </v>

1211
01:01:29.021 --> 01:01:32.150
<v Speaker 4>gastrointestinal side effects that my </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole family could live without,</v>

1212
01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.550
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1213
01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:37.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go into a low carb,</v>

1214
01:01:37.911 --> 01:01:41.100
<v Speaker 4>high fat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is a help,</v>

1215
01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.530
<v Speaker 4>certainly those of us should be eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>or predisposed to get fat or diabetic.</v>

1216
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:47.350
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1217
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Cheese is a very valuable item with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Diet and clearly like the French and the</v>

1218
01:01:51.351 --> 01:01:56.351
<v Speaker 4>Swiss and even the Greeks had enormous </v>
<v Speaker 4>amounts of cheese and they live quite a </v>

1219
01:01:56.351 --> 01:01:58.280
<v Speaker 4>long time there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe in raw milk?</v>

1220
01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:01.010
<v Speaker 4>Have you attempted to try that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or raw cheese?</v>

1221
01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is My gut feeling from him or I'm a,</v>

1222
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:09.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I focus obsessively on one subject and </v>

1223
01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:11.730
<v Speaker 4>it's the carb content and the sugars and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the refined grains and the.</v>

1224
01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.280
<v Speaker 4>What's the cause of obesity?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1225
01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:16.190
<v Speaker 4>Raw milk doesn't enter into that </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussion.</v>

1226
01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:19.320
<v Speaker 4>And what Amanda about it is just from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the gastrointestinal issues,</v>

1227
01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:24.350
<v Speaker 4>because a lot of people believe that raw</v>
<v Speaker 4>milk with all the natural enzymes in it </v>

1228
01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:27.030
<v Speaker 4>is easier for your body to process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's quite possible,</v>

1229
01:02:27.031 --> 01:02:27.930
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>

1230
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:33.950
<v Speaker 4>if you're way weight easily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I wouldn't be recommending liquid </v>

1231
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:36.240
<v Speaker 4>carbs of any kind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including the lactose.</v>

1232
01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.200
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1233
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:43.370
<v Speaker 4>they look at the low carb diets </v>
<v Speaker 4>traditionally and historically they </v>

1234
01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:45.210
<v Speaker 4>never allowed for milk even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1235
01:02:45.211 --> 01:02:47.190
<v Speaker 4>you might go for a heavy cream or cream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1236
01:02:47.191 --> 01:02:51.690
<v Speaker 4>that sort of Atkins thing or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bulletproof coffee thing.</v>

1237
01:02:51.691 --> 01:02:56.691
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of people who are on the </v>

1238
01:02:56.691 --> 01:02:58.590
<v Speaker 4>key to genic diet that will actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>drink heavy cream.</v>

1239
01:02:58.810 --> 01:02:59.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friend Kyle,</v>

1240
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.760
<v Speaker 4>who actually was one of the first people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that turned me onto at Kingsbury,</v>

1241
01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:03.930
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1242
01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:09.020
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he carries around this little fucking </v>

1243
01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:09.020
<v Speaker 4>pint of heavy cream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's a savage.</v>

1244
01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:09.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1245
01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:14.690
<v Speaker 4>my uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>former collaborator Peter Attia who's </v>

1246
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.690
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1247
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:19.730
<v Speaker 4>Internet handle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One point I think was kidogenic man and </v>

1248
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:22.611
<v Speaker 4>he used to drink olive oil cheeses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cream a well because you've got to </v>

1249
01:03:22.611 --> 01:03:26.760
<v Speaker 4>really up the fat those diets for a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of people to get Cathartic.</v>

1250
01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:28.020
<v Speaker 4>Not everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

1251
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:31.660
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought I heard you were trying it.</v>

1252
01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:32.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1253
01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:34.920
<v Speaker 4>And what essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So tell me your diet.</v>

1254
01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.130
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1255
01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:38.850
<v Speaker 4>a lot of Avocados,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of coconut oil.</v>

1256
01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:44.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might eat a little bit more protein </v>

1257
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.180
<v Speaker 4>than I'm supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which unfortunately does convert back to</v>

1258
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:51.230
<v Speaker 4>sugar in your body of glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but easily much more easily processed </v>

1259
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:52.620
<v Speaker 4>obviously than high fructose corn syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1260
01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:58.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very little pastas or grains or breads </v>

1261
01:03:58.220 --> 01:03:59.340
<v Speaker 4>or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a rare thing that I eat that stuff.</v>

1262
01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:00.690
<v Speaker 4>Do you actually measure your ketones?</v>

1263
01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:03.720
<v Speaker 4>I've done it before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have a problem with those things.</v>

1264
01:04:03.721 --> 01:04:04.920
<v Speaker 4>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Jab,</v>

1265
01:04:04.921 --> 01:04:08.010
<v Speaker 4>your finger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too hard for me to get blood out.</v>

1266
01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:12.090
<v Speaker 4>I do a lot of Kettlebell stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>houses on my fingers and my hands,</v>

1267
01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:16.220
<v Speaker 4>so I have to actually go into the side </v>
<v Speaker 4>of my hand to get the blood I have to go</v>

1268
01:04:16.221 --> 01:04:20.790
<v Speaker 4>like above the fingerprints to the upper</v>
<v Speaker 4>skin area and squeeze out the blood.</v>

1269
01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:23.160
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I know when I'm in it.</v>

1270
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:26.340
<v Speaker 4>And also I take um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ketogenic supplements.</v>

1271
01:04:26.341 --> 01:04:30.100
<v Speaker 4>I'll take like a exoticness ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's this stuff called regenix.</v>

1272
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.490
<v Speaker 4>Is there anything that tastes decent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1273
01:04:32.491 --> 01:04:34.620
<v Speaker 4>Key genex tastes really good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tastes good.</v>

1274
01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:35.940
<v Speaker 4>It's a good drink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

1275
01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:40.970
<v Speaker 4>it's made by Dom D'agostino is one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the premier research scientists that's </v>

1276
01:04:42.001 --> 01:04:45.260
<v Speaker 4>devoted to a ketogenic diet and I heard </v>
<v Speaker 4>about him from Tim Ferriss,</v>

1277
01:04:45.261 --> 01:04:50.261
<v Speaker 4>his podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've read some of his work online </v>

1278
01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:51.780
<v Speaker 4>and listened to some of his lectures and</v>
<v Speaker 4>talks and um,</v>

1279
01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:54.000
<v Speaker 4>I find it a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1280
01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:59.350
<v Speaker 4>as far as like appetite suppressing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fantastic once your body starts </v>

1281
01:04:59.350 --> 01:05:01.470
<v Speaker 4>burning fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get that weird hunger thing.</v>

1282
01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:02.250
<v Speaker 4>Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1283
01:05:02.251 --> 01:05:05.350
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing because you're not just</v>
<v Speaker 4>mobilizing your fat,</v>

1284
01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:06.780
<v Speaker 4>burning it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all coming out.</v>

1285
01:05:06.781 --> 01:05:09.360
<v Speaker 4>It's not being your bodies and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold onto it.</v>

1286
01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:11.130
<v Speaker 4>You're not freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

1287
01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.380
<v Speaker 4>It's like when I was on a heavy carb </v>
<v Speaker 4>diet,</v>

1288
01:05:13.381 --> 01:05:15.550
<v Speaker 4>because I love pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>

1289
01:05:15.551 --> 01:05:18.550
<v Speaker 4>Love like Lasagna and linguine with </v>
<v Speaker 4>clams</v>

1290
01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>and it's just like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just love it.</v>

1291
01:05:20.171 --> 01:05:23.950
<v Speaker 1>It's fantastic and occasionally on </v>
<v Speaker 1>indulge as a rare treat now,</v>

1292
01:05:23.951 --> 01:05:28.951
<v Speaker 1>but when I was eating it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have this two or three hour post</v>

1293
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:31.720
<v Speaker 1>eating thing where that stuff would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

1294
01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:35.450
<v Speaker 1>It would all be digested and then I'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking starving in the next hour or so.</v>

1295
01:05:35.451 --> 01:05:39.640
<v Speaker 1>I remember the old joke about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Chinese like two hours later,</v>

1296
01:05:39.641 --> 01:05:40.970
<v Speaker 1>you're starving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1297
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body starts craving those </v>

1298
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:45.990
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates as simple car</v>

1299
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.240
<v Speaker 3>because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>

1300
01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:49.870
<v Speaker 3>You're burning the sugar so you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The carbs are converted to glucose.</v>

1301
01:05:49.871 --> 01:05:52.060
<v Speaker 3>You're burning the glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're secreting insulin,</v>

1302
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:54.960
<v Speaker 3>and the insulin is telling you fat to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hold onto fat.</v>

1303
01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:58.750
<v Speaker 3>This is my theory anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's backed up by the evidence,</v>

1304
01:05:58.751 --> 01:06:01.180
<v Speaker 3>so as the blood sugar starts coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

1305
01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:07.200
<v Speaker 3>your fat tissue is supposed to release </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fat and allow to come out and be </v>

1306
01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:11.611
<v Speaker 3>oxidized by the same cells and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mitochondria in your cells and this </v>

1307
01:06:11.611 --> 01:06:15.511
<v Speaker 3>famous krebs cycle that we're all </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to learn in like 11th grade </v>

1308
01:06:15.511 --> 01:06:18.040
<v Speaker 3>biology and could never remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Krebs cycle is just as happy to burn</v>

1309
01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:22.030
<v Speaker 3>fat as Carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if the insulin's high,</v>

1310
01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.990
<v Speaker 3>it's telling your Mitochondria to burn </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbs,</v>

1311
01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:31.350
<v Speaker 3>not fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's telling the fat cells to hold </v>

1312
01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:31.870
<v Speaker 3>onto fat and now you've just got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dearth of fuel.</v>

1313
01:06:31.871 --> 01:06:34.390
<v Speaker 3>It's actually telling your lean tissue </v>
<v Speaker 3>to hold onto protein,</v>

1314
01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:40.320
<v Speaker 3>so now your blood sugar's coming down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the insulin still elevated and </v>

1315
01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:44.080
<v Speaker 3>there's no fuels replacing the blood </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar and now you bonk,</v>

1316
01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:47.200
<v Speaker 3>you bonk or you start to panic or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1317
01:06:47.201 --> 01:06:49.830
<v Speaker 3>and this is why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1318
01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:52.600
<v Speaker 3>once we instituted this low fat thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people said,</v>

1319
01:06:52.601 --> 01:06:54.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans get fat because they snack all</v>

1320
01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:55.060
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

1321
01:06:55.060 --> 01:07:00.060
<v Speaker 3>They're constantly grazing where they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly grazing because their cells </v>

1322
01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.971
<v Speaker 3>are running out of fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No matter how much they're eating for </v>

1323
01:07:02.971 --> 01:07:04.570
<v Speaker 3>breakfast of their low fat stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're insulin is elevated,</v>

1324
01:07:04.571 --> 01:07:06.490
<v Speaker 3>their cells are gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanna burn carbs.</v>

1325
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:11.670
<v Speaker 3>And this is one of the observations you </v>
<v Speaker 3>found in the literature in the 1830 </v>

1326
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:14.650
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a Hungarian endocrinologist </v>

1327
01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:16.720
<v Speaker 3>working at northwestern university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You talked about some of his obese pay.</v>

1328
01:07:16.721 --> 01:07:21.721
<v Speaker 3>He said he had a patient who was an </v>
<v Speaker 3>obese Alondra's fused to eat laundry </v>

1329
01:07:21.721 --> 01:07:23.080
<v Speaker 3>starch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

1330
01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:27.210
<v Speaker 3>But that's what the fuck is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Laundry starch starch.</v>

1331
01:07:27.211 --> 01:07:28.600
<v Speaker 3>It's a carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1332
01:07:28.601 --> 01:07:30.100
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea.</v>

1333
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.310
<v Speaker 3>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your insulin is elevated,</v>

1334
01:07:33.311 --> 01:07:38.311
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates are your fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's singling your cells to burn glucose</v>

1335
01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:43.270
<v Speaker 3>and not to burn fat and not the burn </v>
<v Speaker 3>protein,</v>

1336
01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:46.720
<v Speaker 3>so carbs are your fuel there young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you need,</v>

1337
01:07:46.721 --> 01:07:51.721
<v Speaker 3>so when you start to get hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you crave that because that's the only </v>

1338
01:07:51.721 --> 01:07:51.721
<v Speaker 3>thing your cells are going to burn.</v>

1339
01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:56.770
<v Speaker 3>So then if you do like you try a get </v>
<v Speaker 3>agentic diet or low carb,</v>

1340
01:07:56.771 --> 01:08:01.771
<v Speaker 3>high fat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you wanna call it and you get </v>

1341
01:08:01.771 --> 01:08:01.840
<v Speaker 3>rid of the carbs and you get an effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your insulin comes down.</v>

1342
01:08:01.841 --> 01:08:04.990
<v Speaker 3>Then you get this natural thing where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you eat your store.</v>

1343
01:08:04.991 --> 01:08:06.760
<v Speaker 3>Some of the fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're burning fat.</v>

1344
01:08:06.761 --> 01:08:08.740
<v Speaker 3>When you're done burning the fat in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>bloodstream,</v>

1345
01:08:08.741 --> 01:08:13.741
<v Speaker 3>the fat comes out of yourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just nice cycle that's supposed </v>

1346
01:08:13.741 --> 01:08:17.101
<v Speaker 3>to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You always have enough fuel available </v>

1347
01:08:17.101 --> 01:08:19.490
<v Speaker 3>that you know you're not hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the common phenomenon.</v>

1348
01:08:19.530 --> 01:08:22.220
<v Speaker 3>It's the idea that suddenly I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>breakfast.</v>

1349
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:27.550
<v Speaker 3>The next thing I know it's two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three in the afternoon and I'm thinking </v>

1350
01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:29.900
<v Speaker 3>maybe I should eat lunch just because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>should eat lunch because I'm hungry.</v>

1351
01:08:29.901 --> 01:08:31.100
<v Speaker 3>Knox,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm starving.</v>

1352
01:08:31.101 --> 01:08:32.150
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they need lunch.</v>

1353
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:35.330
<v Speaker 3>He'll fall asleep afterwards because </v>
<v Speaker 3>your body has a fuel supply because your</v>

1354
01:08:35.331 --> 01:08:40.331
<v Speaker 3>body has a concept fullest by yourselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>or being fueled whether you're reading </v>

1355
01:08:40.331 --> 01:08:43.661
<v Speaker 3>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got an a fat in your body to live </v>

1356
01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:44.450
<v Speaker 3>for like a month even if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>relatively leave.</v>

1357
01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:49.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should point out that some high level </v>

1358
01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:51.671
<v Speaker 1>athletes are having an issue with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people that are used to burning off</v>

1359
01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:56.740
<v Speaker 1>massive amounts cowers during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mixed martial artists and things </v>

1360
01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:59.831
<v Speaker 1>along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them adapt to it fine and I </v>

1361
01:08:59.831 --> 01:09:00.470
<v Speaker 1>haven't had a great time with it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>find it easier to make weight and easier</v>

1362
01:09:00.471 --> 01:09:03.830
<v Speaker 1>to train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other ones say that they have just a</v>

1363
01:09:03.831 --> 01:09:06.410
<v Speaker 1>lack of that extra gear and training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1364
01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:09.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're doing it fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined,</v>

1365
01:09:09.741 --> 01:09:11.140
<v Speaker 1>like if they're monitoring their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketones.</v>

1366
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:14.870
<v Speaker 1>If they're really sure about their diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got it 75 slash 25.</v>

1367
01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:19.680
<v Speaker 3>Some of the earliest studies ever done </v>
<v Speaker 3>on this was by a guy named Steve Finney,</v>

1368
01:09:19.681 --> 01:09:24.681
<v Speaker 3>who's co author of two books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the art and science of low carb living </v>

1369
01:09:24.721 --> 01:09:29.721
<v Speaker 3>in the art and science of low carb </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance and Steve Back in the late </v>

1370
01:09:29.721 --> 01:09:30.090
<v Speaker 3>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early eighties.</v>

1371
01:09:30.091 --> 01:09:31.710
<v Speaker 3>He was at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's Vermont,</v>

1372
01:09:32.050 --> 01:09:37.050
<v Speaker 3>where there was a team of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>studying doing some interesting diet </v>

1373
01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:40.251
<v Speaker 3>experiments and he put professional bike</v>
<v Speaker 3>racers and ketogenic diets and measured </v>

1374
01:09:40.681 --> 01:09:45.681
<v Speaker 3>their performance versus their sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditional high carb diets and he keto </v>

1375
01:09:45.961 --> 01:09:50.961
<v Speaker 3>adapted them so they were fully adapted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to burning fat for fuel and from his </v>

1376
01:09:51.331 --> 01:09:56.331
<v Speaker 3>studies basically he said that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>more efficient until they have to push </v>

1377
01:09:57.811 --> 01:10:02.811
<v Speaker 3>that last sort of five percent out like </v>
<v Speaker 3>up a mountain marathon or getting to </v>

1378
01:10:02.811 --> 01:10:07.170
<v Speaker 3>heartbreak hill and the Boston marathon </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they lose that extra push.</v>

1379
01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:12.390
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what makes sense because that </v>

1380
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.390
<v Speaker 1>extra push is all what mixed martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts is about.</v>

1381
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That extra push is all about.</v>

1382
01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:16.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean in mma it's all about exploding </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're tired.</v>

1383
01:10:16.781 --> 01:10:21.781
<v Speaker 1>It's all about being able to manage your</v>
<v Speaker 1>endurance over the course of five </v>

1384
01:10:21.781 --> 01:10:26.011
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but figuring out these sprint times and </v>

1385
01:10:26.011 --> 01:10:26.011
<v Speaker 1>being able to squeeze the most out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those two.</v>

1386
01:10:26.011 --> 01:10:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Break your opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1387
01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of times it's based on how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much you have in the tank.</v>

1388
01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:34.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's the thing and I mean a lot </v>

1389
01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:34.660
<v Speaker 3>of it you should still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can still,</v>

1390
01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:37.340
<v Speaker 3>even though it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carb loading when it was first a sort of</v>

1391
01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:41.220
<v Speaker 3>perfected was the developed in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Scandinavia by.</v>

1392
01:10:41.221 --> 01:10:46.221
<v Speaker 3>I'm in back in the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was by the coaches have cross</v>

1393
01:10:46.461 --> 01:10:50.660
<v Speaker 3>country skiers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is an incredibly like physically a</v>

1394
01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:52.040
<v Speaker 3>burden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some brutal,</v>

1395
01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.060
<v Speaker 3>brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

1396
01:10:53.061 --> 01:10:58.061
<v Speaker 3>And they trained all year long on low </v>
<v Speaker 3>carb diets so they would train on low </v>

1397
01:10:58.061 --> 01:11:00.800
<v Speaker 3>carb diets and the idea was they would </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat the plate of pasta,</v>

1398
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the race and they would maximize their </v>

1399
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.891
<v Speaker 3>glycogen stores and they're living in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their cells and then when they needed </v>

1400
01:11:08.891 --> 01:11:08.891
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was there.</v>

1401
01:11:08.891 --> 01:11:10.000
<v Speaker 3>And is that have been proven efficient?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh?</v>

1402
01:11:10.001 --> 01:11:12.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was a great way for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it was.</v>

1403
01:11:12.681 --> 01:11:17.681
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point is at reading the low carb </v>

1404
01:11:17.681 --> 01:11:19.401
<v Speaker 3>diets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the until the year and then once </v>

1405
01:11:19.401 --> 01:11:22.730
<v Speaker 3>marathoner started doing everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought with marathon and she'd eat </v>

1406
01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:25.500
<v Speaker 3>carbs the night before a marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should always eat carbs.</v>

1407
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.500
<v Speaker 3>And then this idea that carpenter </v>
<v Speaker 3>heart-healthy came in and they just took</v>

1408
01:11:28.501 --> 01:11:29.550
<v Speaker 3>over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1409
01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:34.760
<v Speaker 3>but my area of expertise is by no means </v>
<v Speaker 3>like high performance athletes.</v>

1410
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:37.230
<v Speaker 3>There are people out there who could </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to you for,</v>

1411
01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:39.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll recommend some when we get off.</v>

1412
01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:43.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1413
01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:46.350
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting because even when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>read the debates about this stuff,</v>

1414
01:11:46.351 --> 01:11:50.280
<v Speaker 3>what the high performance athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see this and like outside magazine and</v>

1415
01:11:50.281 --> 01:11:55.281
<v Speaker 3>runner's world stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's this fundamental argument </v>

1416
01:11:55.281 --> 01:11:55.281
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1417
01:11:55.281 --> 01:11:55.950
<v Speaker 3>we don't get facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We too much.</v>

1418
01:11:55.951 --> 01:12:00.951
<v Speaker 3>We get fat because of carbohydrates in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our diet causes hormonal metabolic </v>

1419
01:12:00.951 --> 01:12:03.960
<v Speaker 3>dysregulation that makes us store </v>
<v Speaker 3>calories of fat and our fat cells.</v>

1420
01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:10.730
<v Speaker 3>And that implies that the healthiest </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet for those of us who get fat or </v>

1421
01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:11.420
<v Speaker 3>diets absent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1422
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:16.130
<v Speaker 3>easily digestible carbs and sugars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if athletes,</v>

1423
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:21.170
<v Speaker 3>very high performing athletes eat those </v>
<v Speaker 3>diets and don't perform better than </v>

1424
01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:25.221
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a good diet and therefore all </v>

1425
01:12:25.221 --> 01:12:26.400
<v Speaker 3>the rest of it is wrong and that's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

1426
01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:31.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of what Lance Armstrong needs </v>

1427
01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:32.640
<v Speaker 3>to win the Tour de France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

1428
01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:35.430
<v Speaker 3>doesn't tell me a hell of a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

1429
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shirley Maclaine talk weighs 300 pounds </v>

1430
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.680
<v Speaker 3>and can't lose that weight unless she </v>
<v Speaker 3>gives up carbohydrates,</v>

1431
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:46.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of that gets confounded in these</v>

1432
01:12:46.561 --> 01:12:51.561
<v Speaker 3>discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things I'm constantly </v>

1433
01:12:51.561 --> 01:12:54.021
<v Speaker 3>doing when I talk about this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying you got to keep your eye on a </v>

1434
01:12:54.021 --> 01:12:57.440
<v Speaker 3>question because we were all given </v>
<v Speaker 3>different answers to different </v>

1435
01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:01.491
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's the best diet for winning the </v>

1436
01:13:01.491 --> 01:13:04.161
<v Speaker 3>Tour de France or mma fight probably got</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the same themes that I'm </v>

1437
01:13:06.481 --> 01:13:11.481
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even then funny when sugar came in </v>

1438
01:13:11.481 --> 01:13:16.400
<v Speaker 3>beginning around the 18 nineties and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a cheap and easily available and </v>

1439
01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.600
<v Speaker 3>beach hooker was available element </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany.</v>

1440
01:13:17.650 --> 01:13:22.650
<v Speaker 3>The German army started testing sugar as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a performance enhancer and actually </v>

1441
01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:27.351
<v Speaker 3>doing sort of trials where they would </v>
<v Speaker 3>send troops out with or without sugar </v>

1442
01:13:27.351 --> 01:13:27.351
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1443
01:13:27.351 --> 01:13:32.300
<v Speaker 3>30 day marches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they would see when they came </v>

1444
01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.571
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which ones had more energy and the ones </v>

1445
01:13:35.571 --> 01:13:35.571
<v Speaker 3>who ate more sugar had more energy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1446
01:13:35.571 --> 01:13:37.350
<v Speaker 3>a mountain climbers started using it.</v>

1447
01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:40.800
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crew coach has started testing it on the</v>

1448
01:13:40.801 --> 01:13:42.780
<v Speaker 3>crew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like rowing back then was a,</v>

1449
01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:44.700
<v Speaker 3>among the most popular sports in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1450
01:13:44.701 --> 01:13:49.701
<v Speaker 3>And so they would give their rowers a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar and see if they perform better,</v>

1451
01:13:50.191 --> 01:13:55.191
<v Speaker 3>which they inevitably did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a great performance enhancing </v>

1452
01:13:55.191 --> 01:13:55.191
<v Speaker 3>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a psychoactive drug.</v>

1453
01:13:55.191 --> 01:13:56.730
<v Speaker 3>It kills pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

1454
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:57.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the joke.</v>

1455
01:13:57.481 --> 01:13:59.340
<v Speaker 3>It's quick energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sugar kills pain.</v>

1456
01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's why we give it the kids,</v>

1457
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:05.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your baby was he circumcised.</v>

1458
01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:09.090
<v Speaker 3>I've girls then okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not an issue.</v>

1459
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:11.790
<v Speaker 3>Boys circumcise them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give them a little bit of sugar.</v>

1460
01:14:12.330 --> 01:14:14.480
<v Speaker 3>You never heard of that though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1461
01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.500
<v Speaker 3>it's a distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a pain killer.</v>

1462
01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:22.501
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a wonderful psychoactive </v>

1463
01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:23.680
<v Speaker 3>properties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No short term side effects.</v>

1464
01:14:23.681 --> 01:14:24.510
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and me,</v>

1465
01:14:24.511 --> 01:14:27.520
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about must be talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a very minor if you also,</v>

1466
01:14:27.521 --> 01:14:30.070
<v Speaker 3>if you start with populations that never</v>
<v Speaker 3>consumed sugar,</v>

1467
01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:32.410
<v Speaker 3>babies never consumed it before you </v>
<v Speaker 3>came.</v>

1468
01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:37.420
<v Speaker 3>A little sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on day three you can circumcise </v>

1469
01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:37.420
<v Speaker 3>them and then they're just tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're fine.</v>

1470
01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:37.880
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

1471
01:14:37.881 --> 01:14:40.070
<v Speaker 3>I'll take it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to live with what,</v>

1472
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:41.770
<v Speaker 3>what am I gonna use that for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1473
01:14:41.771 --> 01:14:43.180
<v Speaker 3>when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're three days old,</v>

1474
01:14:43.181 --> 01:14:44.440
<v Speaker 3>you got no imagination.</v>

1475
01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:50.660
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We could talk about um,</v>

1476
01:14:52.290 --> 01:14:53.970
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1477
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.020
<v Speaker 5>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing,</v>

1478
01:14:55.021 --> 01:14:55.220
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1479
01:14:56.150 --> 01:14:59.340
<v Speaker 3>it's that it could be a performance </v>
<v Speaker 3>enhancing drug</v>

1480
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:04.750
<v Speaker 3>that would enhance the performance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>athletes at the highest level.</v>

1481
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't mean it doesn't have longterm </v>
<v Speaker 3>chronic affects,</v>

1482
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:11.530
<v Speaker 3>just like any other performance </v>
<v Speaker 3>enhancing drug.</v>

1483
01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:16.560
<v Speaker 3>So there's a big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are like say climbing k two </v>

1484
01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:20.160
<v Speaker 3>that need something to push them forward</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus the average person who likes to </v>

1485
01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.200
<v Speaker 3>play Racquetball and works a day job and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1486
01:15:23.201 --> 01:15:28.201
<v Speaker 3>and that kind of a diet and think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the athletic trainers who have </v>

1487
01:15:28.201 --> 01:15:32.281
<v Speaker 3>been telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the guys you work out with your </v>

1488
01:15:32.281 --> 01:15:32.281
<v Speaker 3>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1489
01:15:32.281 --> 01:15:35.331
<v Speaker 3>the lean muscular guys who never had an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ounce of fat in their lives and they're </v>

1490
01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:40.380
<v Speaker 3>saying we should all wheat carbs that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>should always sugar because I look how </v>

1491
01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:42.420
<v Speaker 3>well I process it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my argument is like,</v>

1492
01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:47.590
<v Speaker 3>if you think your body works the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>way as your cousin who weighs 300 pounds</v>

1493
01:15:47.591 --> 01:15:52.240
<v Speaker 3>and the only differences you exercise </v>
<v Speaker 3>more like that's a serious delusion.</v>

1494
01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:55.300
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're different people.</v>

1495
01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:56.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have siblings?</v>

1496
01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.740
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you all built in like a sister?</v>

1497
01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:03.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's mean she's,</v>

1498
01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she works out a little bit.</v>

1499
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:06.250
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not like I do,</v>

1500
01:16:06.251 --> 01:16:08.740
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have good genes in that regard.</v>

1501
01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:10.120
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid,</v>

1502
01:16:10.121 --> 01:16:12.910
<v Speaker 3>my older brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mathematician,</v>

1503
01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:17.110
<v Speaker 3>brilliant guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was always taller,</v>

1504
01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:19.660
<v Speaker 3>leaner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you could see the veins on his arms</v>

1505
01:16:19.661 --> 01:16:23.140
<v Speaker 3>and the ripples on his stomach just </v>
<v Speaker 3>seven years old by a lot by.</v>

1506
01:16:23.150 --> 01:16:26.350
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't genetic because I clearly had </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same gene to different body types.</v>

1507
01:16:26.351 --> 01:16:27.380
<v Speaker 3>But they vary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1508
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when he got to college,</v>

1509
01:16:29.261 --> 01:16:34.261
<v Speaker 3>he was a rower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't get over one 95 no matter </v>

1510
01:16:34.261 --> 01:16:34.540
<v Speaker 3>how much he ate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he used to say</v>

1511
01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:39.090
<v Speaker 3>never forget this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never get stuffed or just get bored</v>

1512
01:16:39.091 --> 01:16:43.170
<v Speaker 3>of eating after a few hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was shorter,</v>

1513
01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:44.940
<v Speaker 3>thicker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1514
01:16:44.941 --> 01:16:49.080
<v Speaker 3>I put on weight relatively easily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the time I was in high school,</v>

1515
01:16:49.081 --> 01:16:52.350
<v Speaker 3>I weighed one 95 when I was playing </v>
<v Speaker 3>division two,</v>

1516
01:16:52.351 --> 01:16:55.410
<v Speaker 3>college football,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could get up to 2:37</v>

1517
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:59.490
<v Speaker 3>and no matter how much I ate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could not get above 2:37</v>

1518
01:16:59.491 --> 01:17:01.110
<v Speaker 3>and I was three inches shorter than he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

1519
01:17:01.111 --> 01:17:03.180
<v Speaker 3>We just had different body types.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

1520
01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:08.240
<v Speaker 3>I've built muscle easier than he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I put on fat easier than he did.</v>

1521
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:13.270
<v Speaker 3>It had nothing to with how much we both </v>
<v Speaker 3>ate as much as we could in fact dinners </v>

1522
01:17:13.311 --> 01:17:15.860
<v Speaker 3>in our family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like 18 minutes because it was,</v>

1523
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:18.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mother was put down like you know,</v>

1524
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:23.110
<v Speaker 3>enough for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for eight people and if I didn't trust </v>

1525
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.110
<v Speaker 3>my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1526
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:24.490
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Started seven over seven,</v>

1527
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.300
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what she served.</v>

1528
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:33.270
<v Speaker 1>When you're looking at all this data and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're putting together this book and </v>

1529
01:17:33.341 --> 01:17:37.520
<v Speaker 1>you realize that you're going to drop </v>
<v Speaker 1>this mindblower on people that we're,</v>

1530
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:42.550
<v Speaker 1>we've been essentially misled by almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>every established organization when it </v>

1531
01:17:44.441 --> 01:17:49.441
<v Speaker 1>comes to health and diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you feeling when you're about to</v>

1532
01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:51.130
<v Speaker 1>release it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you has a 10.</v>

1533
01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Is this one thing we like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ?</v>

1534
01:17:52.961 --> 01:17:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Am I just do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1535
01:17:54.401 --> 01:17:57.760
<v Speaker 1>did you have this like incredible desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like double check,</v>

1536
01:17:57.761 --> 01:17:59.350
<v Speaker 1>triple check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quadruple check?</v>

1537
01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:04.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I should have the um.</v>

1538
01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:06.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first time this happened,</v>

1539
01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:12.040
<v Speaker 3>so the articles in science for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're using then create all that much </v>

1540
01:18:12.741 --> 01:18:13.520
<v Speaker 3>controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1541
01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:18.521
<v Speaker 3>they won awards and reporting awards and</v>
<v Speaker 3>know they were in books about the best </v>

1542
01:18:18.521 --> 01:18:21.770
<v Speaker 3>science writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nobody really cared.</v>

1543
01:18:21.771 --> 01:18:26.771
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was enough controversy </v>
<v Speaker 3>about whether this low fat diet for </v>

1544
01:18:26.771 --> 01:18:27.920
<v Speaker 3>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the right thing that I do.</v>

1545
01:18:27.921 --> 01:18:29.930
<v Speaker 3>This New York Times magazine article </v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

1546
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:34.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea was to go out and find out that</v>

1547
01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:39.700
<v Speaker 3>this was pitched in 2001 and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our awareness of the obesity epidemic </v>

1548
01:18:40.251 --> 01:18:45.251
<v Speaker 3>was only about three years old and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could pinpoint it in time from between </v>

1549
01:18:45.251 --> 01:18:47.600
<v Speaker 3>the late 19 seventies to the early 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>nineties,</v>

1550
01:18:47.601 --> 01:18:51.500
<v Speaker 3>two surveys that were done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And during those two surveys,</v>

1551
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:54.650
<v Speaker 3>the prevalence of obesity almost almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>doubled.</v>

1552
01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:57.020
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the percentage of Americans.</v>

1553
01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.840
<v Speaker 3>So you'd asked the question what caused </v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

1554
01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:03.980
<v Speaker 3>And I have two hypotheses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One was we had shifted the 19 sixties,</v>

1555
01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:09.010
<v Speaker 3>that conventional wisdom was that </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates are uniquely fattening.</v>

1556
01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:14.820
<v Speaker 3>Like one our line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I quote and two of my books was the </v>

1557
01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:17.740
<v Speaker 3>first sentence of a British journal of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nutrition Article Nineteen Sixty three </v>

1558
01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:20.210
<v Speaker 3>written by one of the two leading </v>
<v Speaker 3>British Dietitians was every woman knows</v>

1559
01:19:20.211 --> 01:19:23.690
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates are fattening and every </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman knew this car,</v>

1560
01:19:23.691 --> 01:19:24.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bread,</v>

1561
01:19:24.291 --> 01:19:25.370
<v Speaker 3>pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>potatoes,</v>

1562
01:19:25.371 --> 01:19:26.230
<v Speaker 3>rice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beer,</v>

1563
01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:27.180
<v Speaker 3>sweets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1564
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:29.310
<v Speaker 3>they'd go right to your hips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a.</v>

1565
01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:35.170
<v Speaker 3>and then we turned them into a heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy diet foods by the 19 eighties </v>

1566
01:19:35.170 --> 01:19:38.640
<v Speaker 3>and that happened between was </v>
<v Speaker 3>institutionalized between 1977 and 1984 </v>

1567
01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:44.141
<v Speaker 3>and [inaudible] 84 like the New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>Times health reporters writing or Beth </v>

1568
01:19:44.331 --> 01:19:49.331
<v Speaker 3>selling diet health cooking book called </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Good Food Book.</v>

1569
01:19:49.341 --> 01:19:50.240
<v Speaker 3>And she's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1570
01:19:50.241 --> 01:19:55.241
<v Speaker 3>we used to think carbs are fattening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now we should eat pasta and bread </v>

1571
01:19:55.241 --> 01:19:55.241
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

1572
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:58.220
<v Speaker 3>So that was one hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other was high fructose corn syrup,</v>

1573
01:19:58.221 --> 01:20:03.221
<v Speaker 3>which came in in 1977 and had sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>replaced sugar and Pepsi and coke by </v>

1574
01:20:03.221 --> 01:20:04.980
<v Speaker 3>1984.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

1575
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:10.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing that piece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized I find stumbled upon five </v>

1576
01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:12.981
<v Speaker 3>studies of the Atkins Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Atkins Diet is the scientists </v>

1577
01:20:13.651 --> 01:20:18.651
<v Speaker 3>call the anomalous observation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you're always looking for in </v>

1578
01:20:18.651 --> 01:20:18.780
<v Speaker 3>sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the anomalous observation,</v>

1579
01:20:18.781 --> 01:20:23.160
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing that doesn't fit with </v>
<v Speaker 3>any of your beliefs,</v>

1580
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:26.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a theory that says this,</v>

1581
01:20:26.311 --> 01:20:30.480
<v Speaker 3>and then you find that and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now you've got a way to come up with</v>

1582
01:20:30.481 --> 01:20:32.250
<v Speaker 3>a better theory because you got </v>
<v Speaker 3>something else,</v>

1583
01:20:32.251 --> 01:20:37.251
<v Speaker 3>you have to explain that you're present </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory doesn't and it's the anomalous </v>

1584
01:20:37.251 --> 01:20:41.001
<v Speaker 3>observations that move science forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the thing that just doesn't fit </v>

1585
01:20:41.001 --> 01:20:44.181
<v Speaker 3>with your belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's the Diet trials where he got </v>

1586
01:20:44.181 --> 01:20:46.350
<v Speaker 3>the atkins diet high in fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high in saturated fat.</v>

1587
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:47.790
<v Speaker 3>So she'll give you heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1588
01:20:47.791 --> 01:20:49.980
<v Speaker 3>double quarter pounder with cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no bun,</v>

1589
01:20:49.981 --> 01:20:53.070
<v Speaker 3>lobster Newberg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know eggs,</v>

1590
01:20:53.071 --> 01:20:54.480
<v Speaker 3>bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sausage,</v>

1591
01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.270
<v Speaker 3>and you're allowed to eat as much as you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

1592
01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.350
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a calorie restricted diet,</v>

1593
01:21:01.351 --> 01:21:03.450
<v Speaker 3>it's Ad Libitum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as you don't eat carbs,</v>

1594
01:21:03.451 --> 01:21:07.650
<v Speaker 3>you could have eight eggs for breakfast </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a rash for a bacon and you know,</v>

1595
01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:11.150
<v Speaker 3>whole chicken for lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the other theories,</v>

1596
01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:13.320
<v Speaker 3>theories of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to cause heart disease.</v>

1597
01:21:13.321 --> 01:21:18.321
<v Speaker 3>And the other theory is that the eat as </v>
<v Speaker 3>much as you want you to have a fat </v>

1598
01:21:18.321 --> 01:21:18.321
<v Speaker 3>person and as much as want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to get fatter,</v>

1599
01:21:18.321 --> 01:21:23.301
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we think they got fat to begin </v>

1600
01:21:23.301 --> 01:21:25.371
<v Speaker 3>with because they ate too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you compare those people to </v>

1601
01:21:25.371 --> 01:21:27.410
<v Speaker 3>people you put on an American heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>association,</v>

1602
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:31.500
<v Speaker 3>low fat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you tell them to calorie restrict my</v>

1603
01:21:31.501 --> 01:21:32.740
<v Speaker 3>repeating myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1604
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:33.970
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1605
01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:34.350
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>

1606
01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:39.410
<v Speaker 3>You know the ice cream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scoop size tuna salad on the lettuce </v>

1607
01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:41.940
<v Speaker 3>patty thing that we all went through at </v>
<v Speaker 3>some point in their life.</v>

1608
01:21:41.970 --> 01:21:45.270
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not you if you're naturally lane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1609
01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:49.350
<v Speaker 3>it all five of these trials and they'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>been done but not published yet,</v>

1610
01:21:49.351 --> 01:21:51.150
<v Speaker 3>and they'd been presented at </v>
<v Speaker 3>conferences.</v>

1611
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:56.450
<v Speaker 3>The people on the Atkins Diet not only </v>
<v Speaker 3>lost more weight than the ones on their </v>

1612
01:21:56.770 --> 01:21:59.090
<v Speaker 3>calorie restricted American heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>association,</v>

1613
01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:02.160
<v Speaker 3>low fat diet that a whole American </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were supposed to eating.</v>

1614
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:08.350
<v Speaker 3>So that refutes the eating too much </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis because these guys on the </v>

1615
01:22:08.431 --> 01:22:10.260
<v Speaker 3>atkins diet can eat as much as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

1616
01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:13.590
<v Speaker 3>but their heart disease risk factors are</v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

1617
01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:19.580
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're supposed to die of heart </v>

1618
01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:19.580
<v Speaker 3>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1619
01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:20.850
<v Speaker 3>eat the bake and a clogs your arteries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fall over dead,</v>

1620
01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:26.720
<v Speaker 3>but they were healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it refutes the heart disease thing </v>

1621
01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:27.060
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's the anomalous observation.</v>

1622
01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:32.420
<v Speaker 3>How do you explain that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If dietary fat causes heart disease and </v>

1623
01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:37.110
<v Speaker 3>eating too much cause obesity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I write this article,</v>

1624
01:22:37.890 --> 01:22:42.890
<v Speaker 3>I lead it with this young Harvard </v>
<v Speaker 3>endocrinologist pediatrician who's </v>

1625
01:22:44.041 --> 01:22:47.850
<v Speaker 3>feeding low carb diets to his patients </v>
<v Speaker 3>at Boston Children's hospital.</v>

1626
01:22:47.851 --> 01:22:50.490
<v Speaker 3>He's like politically acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's sincere,</v>

1627
01:22:50.491 --> 01:22:53.850
<v Speaker 3>he's at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to ease people into it.</v>

1628
01:22:55.660 --> 01:23:00.660
<v Speaker 3>And then I talked about the Atkins thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>down below and how Atkins had gotten </v>

1629
01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:04.431
<v Speaker 3>pilloried back in the late sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early seventies for telling people they </v>

1630
01:23:04.431 --> 01:23:06.340
<v Speaker 3>could eat these high fat diets because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we thought,</v>

1631
01:23:06.610 --> 01:23:11.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what these studies showed and the </v>

1632
01:23:11.610 --> 01:23:14.221
<v Speaker 3>editors at the New York Times magazine </v>
<v Speaker 3>said Atkins is the elephant in the </v>

1633
01:23:14.221 --> 01:23:16.810
<v Speaker 3>living room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like get rid of this Harvard guy.</v>

1634
01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Put them down below.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lead with the Atkins.</v>

1635
01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:20.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1636
01:23:20.891 --> 01:23:23.020
<v Speaker 3>they know how to get people to read an </v>
<v Speaker 3>article.</v>

1637
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:29.000
<v Speaker 3>So I write this lead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read it to my wife and a chair of the </v>

1638
01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:30.940
<v Speaker 3>American Medical Association,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the American Heart Association,</v>

1639
01:23:30.941 --> 01:23:35.410
<v Speaker 3>have a find yourself standing naked </v>
<v Speaker 3>nightmare in times square,</v>

1640
01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:40.440
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find yourself standing naked in times </v>

1641
01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:40.440
<v Speaker 3>square nightmare.</v>

1642
01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:44.250
<v Speaker 3>It's that all the advice they've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving to the American people about a </v>

1643
01:23:44.250 --> 01:23:47.701
<v Speaker 3>healthy diet for the last 50 years is </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong and maybe atkins was right all </v>

1644
01:23:47.711 --> 01:23:52.711
<v Speaker 3>along and maybe both and I read it to my</v>
<v Speaker 3>wife and I say they will never run this </v>

1645
01:23:52.711 --> 01:23:57.271
<v Speaker 3>in a million years and I emailed it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the editors and they don't change a word</v>

1646
01:23:58.690 --> 01:24:03.690
<v Speaker 3>and that's the lead of the magazine </v>
<v Speaker 3>article and then they put this picture </v>

1647
01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:05.530
<v Speaker 3>on the cover of the magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of cheap looking,</v>

1648
01:24:05.650 --> 01:24:10.000
<v Speaker 3>porterhouse steak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't go to photographer to make a</v>

1649
01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:11.810
<v Speaker 3>delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1650
01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:17.040
<v Speaker 3>and it's got a pat of butter and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>headline is what if it's all been a big </v>

1651
01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:20.230
<v Speaker 3>fat lie and I didn't stop them from </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it,</v>

1652
01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.560
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know what to expect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was going to be controversial.</v>

1653
01:24:23.561 --> 01:24:26.530
<v Speaker 3>Getting back to your question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tend to answer long winded.</v>

1654
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:32.430
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was going to be controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was going to be the most </v>

1655
01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:35.170
<v Speaker 3>controversial article they do run into a</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend of mine 10 years earlier,</v>

1656
01:24:35.171 --> 01:24:40.171
<v Speaker 3>had written an article about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>recycling is a complete waste of time </v>

1657
01:24:40.171 --> 01:24:42.700
<v Speaker 3>and money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea what was going to happen,</v>

1658
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:46.900
<v Speaker 3>no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I compare it to my boxing career.</v>

1659
01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:50.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was younger,</v>

1660
01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:51.250
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was at Harvard,</v>

1661
01:24:51.251 --> 01:24:52.930
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my best friend was a boxer.</v>

1662
01:24:52.931 --> 01:24:57.931
<v Speaker 3>He was a street Friday from Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Puerto Rican kid and a wonderful guy.</v>

1663
01:24:58.091 --> 01:25:00.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean everyone school loved them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then uh,</v>

1664
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:05.050
<v Speaker 3>he taught me how to box and we used to </v>
<v Speaker 3>box and the gym and I would do this sort</v>

1665
01:25:05.051 --> 01:25:09.250
<v Speaker 3>of Muhammad Ali imitation because that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I thought boxing was in 1977.</v>

1666
01:25:09.251 --> 01:25:13.660
<v Speaker 3>Then he actually had an amateur fight in</v>
<v Speaker 3>low mass and March 19,</v>

1667
01:25:13.661 --> 01:25:15.740
<v Speaker 3>77,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got killed in the flesh,</v>

1668
01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:16.360
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

1669
01:25:17.370 --> 01:25:19.630
<v Speaker 3>And of course me being young and stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1670
01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:24.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not enough to prevent me from </v>

1671
01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:24.810
<v Speaker 3>continuing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I moved to New York,</v>

1672
01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:25.120
<v Speaker 3>watch the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1673
01:25:25.121 --> 01:25:26.050
<v Speaker 3>we were there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There.</v>

1674
01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:31.080
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know what happened to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He danced into a right hook and went </v>

1675
01:25:32.051 --> 01:25:33.880
<v Speaker 3>over backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was frozen.</v>

1676
01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:37.510
<v Speaker 3>It was a plank of wood and his head </v>
<v Speaker 3>bounced off the Mat.</v>

1677
01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:39.340
<v Speaker 3>That is how I remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got notes.</v>

1678
01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:44.410
<v Speaker 3>My memory is right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the scariest things is when </v>

1679
01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:46.210
<v Speaker 3>the head bounces one of the worst ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get knocked out.</v>

1680
01:25:46.211 --> 01:25:48.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we knew it was bad,</v>

1681
01:25:48.941 --> 01:25:50.500
<v Speaker 3>but we didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't die.</v>

1682
01:25:50.501 --> 01:25:53.680
<v Speaker 3>He went into was in a coma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took him to the hospital.</v>

1683
01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:58.681
<v Speaker 3>We went all home and we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then a week later there's just no </v>

1684
01:25:58.681 --> 01:25:59.980
<v Speaker 3>brain activity and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This how I remember it.</v>

1685
01:25:59.981 --> 01:26:02.330
<v Speaker 3>I hope I'm doing them justice by getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>the memory right.</v>

1686
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nowadays you can google it and read </v>

1687
01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:09.050
<v Speaker 3>about the article in the Boston Globe </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it wasn't article.</v>

1688
01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:10.550
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I moved to New York.</v>

1689
01:26:10.551 --> 01:26:15.551
<v Speaker 3>I'd go to journalism school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who is norman mailer's </v>

1690
01:26:15.551 --> 01:26:18.941
<v Speaker 3>nephew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Norman mailer had a group of people </v>

1691
01:26:18.941 --> 01:26:21.980
<v Speaker 3>used to get together at the gramercy gym</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Saturday mornings in New York.</v>

1692
01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this another long winded answer to your </v>

1693
01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:27.020
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked about shaggy dog story.</v>

1694
01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:30.260
<v Speaker 3>So every Saturday morning we meet at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gramercy gym,</v>

1695
01:26:30.261 --> 01:26:35.261
<v Speaker 3>which is the 14th and around Lexington </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it was back then it was a very </v>

1696
01:26:35.261 --> 01:26:36.620
<v Speaker 3>seedy neighborhood and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1697
01:26:36.621 --> 01:26:38.130
<v Speaker 3>a classic gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1698
01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:43.250
<v Speaker 3>Classic boxing and some really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Ryan O'Neal was buddies with Norman</v>

1699
01:26:43.401 --> 01:26:46.730
<v Speaker 3>would show up once every three months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was a guy who ran,</v>

1700
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:49.310
<v Speaker 3>I forget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a porn magazine that was sold the</v>

1701
01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Brown paper bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would show up and then a half dozen </v>

1702
01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:57.700
<v Speaker 3>other people I had this friend Steve </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chow went on to,</v>

1703
01:26:57.710 --> 01:26:58.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1704
01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.930
<v Speaker 3>become uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>barry diller's righthand man.</v>

1705
01:27:01.930 --> 01:27:06.930
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood would actually been the </v>

1706
01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Valedictorian of our class at Harvard </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we would spar and um,</v>

1707
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:14.350
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed it and I got into it and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting the crap beat out of me first.</v>

1708
01:27:14.931 --> 01:27:16.460
<v Speaker 3>But eventually I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1709
01:27:16.461 --> 01:27:21.461
<v Speaker 3>I kept doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I decided to fight in the New </v>

1710
01:27:21.461 --> 01:27:21.461
<v Speaker 3>York golden gloves and write about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>for playboy.</v>

1711
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:23.240
<v Speaker 3>So the piece was called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1712
01:27:23.241 --> 01:27:25.920
<v Speaker 3>what a life is a standing eight count.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hello?</v>

1713
01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:28.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is after your friend died.</v>

1714
01:27:28.190 --> 01:27:30.170
<v Speaker 3>This is after my friend died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1715
01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:35.200
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point is kind of like going from </v>

1716
01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:39.611
<v Speaker 3>sparring to your first match now you had</v>
<v Speaker 3>a much more successful career than I </v>

1717
01:27:40.131 --> 01:27:42.760
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had two flights and I'm,</v>

1718
01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:48.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the first one because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Irish cop I was fighting got tired of </v>

1719
01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.760
<v Speaker 3>punching me and I finally thought if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit him back,</v>

1720
01:27:49.761 --> 01:27:51.040
<v Speaker 3>maybe that'll slow them down.</v>

1721
01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:56.080
<v Speaker 3>It worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that transition from sparring to </v>

1722
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:59.930
<v Speaker 3>being in the ring and having someone to </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat the crap out of you is like,</v>

1723
01:27:59.931 --> 01:28:04.931
<v Speaker 3>you just can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cannot conceive of what it's going </v>

1724
01:28:04.931 --> 01:28:06.700
<v Speaker 3>to be like until you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1725
01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:12.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you can remember back to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>first flight and you might've been more </v>

1726
01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:13.820
<v Speaker 3>of a natural animal than I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of a cerebral guy.</v>

1727
01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:17.420
<v Speaker 3>I think too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what it was like getting this</v>

1728
01:28:17.421 --> 01:28:22.421
<v Speaker 3>article published.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I knew it was going to be </v>

1729
01:28:22.421 --> 01:28:24.251
<v Speaker 3>controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want me to tell you the end of the </v>

1730
01:28:24.251 --> 01:28:24.251
<v Speaker 3>boxing story?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1731
01:28:24.251 --> 01:28:28.830
<v Speaker 3>And one of my first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knocked out this cop from Staten </v>

1732
01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:30.050
<v Speaker 3>Island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I was done.</v>

1733
01:28:30.051 --> 01:28:31.820
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't enjoy winning.</v>

1734
01:28:31.821 --> 01:28:35.390
<v Speaker 3>I did not enjoy knocking them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like anything about it.</v>

1735
01:28:35.391 --> 01:28:40.391
<v Speaker 3>This nose was not built for getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>pummeled and I was not a very good </v>

1736
01:28:40.391 --> 01:28:40.880
<v Speaker 3>defensive fighter.</v>

1737
01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:43.750
<v Speaker 3>And then the second fight I went up </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the guy who wanted,</v>

1738
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:47.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was the not the open category,</v>

1739
01:28:47.001 --> 01:28:52.001
<v Speaker 3>the 10 flights or less category and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked me out in a minute and 37 </v>

1740
01:28:52.001 --> 01:28:54.130
<v Speaker 3>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend who,</v>

1741
01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:59.200
<v Speaker 3>a photographer for life who came.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Norman mailer was at the flight to </v>

1742
01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:02.860
<v Speaker 3>Norman sitting there watching me get the</v>
<v Speaker 3>crap beat out of me and my friend was a </v>

1743
01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:07.430
<v Speaker 3>photographer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't have time to get her lens cap </v>

1744
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.430
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically she,</v>

1745
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:11.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that I have a photo that ran in </v>

1746
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:13.800
<v Speaker 3>playboy with the article which was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could she bring level when you see these</v>

1747
01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:17.010
<v Speaker 3>two big feet sticking up in this body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prone on the ring,</v>

1748
01:29:17.190 --> 01:29:20.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you get knocked unconscious when you</v>

1749
01:29:20.581 --> 01:29:25.581
<v Speaker 3>woke up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How terrified were you thinking at all </v>

1750
01:29:25.581 --> 01:29:25.581
<v Speaker 3>about your friend who died?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1751
01:29:25.650 --> 01:29:26.310
<v Speaker 3>that's the funny thing.</v>

1752
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought about it afterwards,</v>

1753
01:29:29.251 --> 01:29:32.580
<v Speaker 3>so it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently,</v>

1754
01:29:32.581 --> 01:29:33.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I woke up in the ring.</v>

1755
01:29:33.961 --> 01:29:36.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean I stood up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they raised the other guy's hand.</v>

1756
01:29:36.451 --> 01:29:39.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My memory of the fight at all,</v>

1757
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:44.510
<v Speaker 3>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit of like these roundhouses </v>

1758
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:48.890
<v Speaker 3>whizzing by my head and I had this </v>
<v Speaker 3>tendency I would like pull my head back </v>

1759
01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:50.820
<v Speaker 3>so I'm pulling my hands down instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible instinct.</v>

1760
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:56.110
<v Speaker 3>Natural for some strange reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to teach people to </v>

1761
01:29:56.110 --> 01:29:56.460
<v Speaker 3>not do the worst thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1762
01:29:56.461 --> 01:29:59.250
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if my career had lasted past that fight,</v>

1763
01:29:59.251 --> 01:30:02.100
<v Speaker 3>my very good coach would have broken it </v>
<v Speaker 3>down to me.</v>

1764
01:30:02.110 --> 01:30:04.290
<v Speaker 3>Would've said don't ever do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know.</v>

1765
01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:05.550
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1766
01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:10.880
<v Speaker 3>my memory is I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting outside the ring and the </v>

1767
01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:11.850
<v Speaker 3>doctor is saying to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know what your name is?</v>

1768
01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:16.880
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a period of my life was </v>

1769
01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:16.880
<v Speaker 3>clearly conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have no memory of it.</v>

1770
01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:18.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they,</v>

1771
01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.710
<v Speaker 3>they make you go to the hospital </v>
<v Speaker 3>afterwards to make sure you're not going</v>

1772
01:30:21.711 --> 01:30:26.711
<v Speaker 3>to die overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was in the emergency room and </v>

1773
01:30:26.711 --> 01:30:30.350
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy next to me who had had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>motorcycle accident and cabot cut him </v>

1774
01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:31.850
<v Speaker 3>off and he had the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking,</v>

1775
01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:35.820
<v Speaker 3>he was about my age Hispanic and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1776
01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:41.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing where there's no way you say </v>

1777
01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:44.901
<v Speaker 3>the next thing I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's this awareness that </v>

1778
01:30:44.901 --> 01:30:47.040
<v Speaker 3>there could vary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could very well have never been in.</v>

1779
01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:48.600
<v Speaker 3>Next thing I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1780
01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:52.890
<v Speaker 3>the moment could have just ended there </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what I started thinking about</v>

1781
01:30:52.891 --> 01:30:57.891
<v Speaker 3>my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was too busy getting mad at the </v>

1782
01:30:57.891 --> 01:31:00.621
<v Speaker 3>hospital attended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who kept telling me that my nose was </v>

1783
01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:01.140
<v Speaker 3>broken and I kept saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my nose isn't broken,</v>

1784
01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:01.890
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>

1785
01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:07.010
<v Speaker 3>This is the notes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was born with a man that's a broken </v>

1786
01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:07.290
<v Speaker 3>nose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know broken nose when I see one,</v>

1787
01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:09.810
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1788
01:31:09.811 --> 01:31:12.030
<v Speaker 3>that was a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I published this article.</v>

1789
01:31:12.031 --> 01:31:17.031
<v Speaker 3>I've got no idea what's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1790
01:31:17.190 --> 01:31:19.580
<v Speaker 3>it was like just the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1791
01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:25.040
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an enormous amount of media </v>

1792
01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.811
<v Speaker 3>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm doing tv shows and radio shows </v>

1793
01:31:26.811 --> 01:31:29.391
<v Speaker 3>and people are writing about me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people are attacking me because the </v>

1794
01:31:29.391 --> 01:31:30.510
<v Speaker 3>implication is not just did the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrition,</v>

1795
01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:35.750
<v Speaker 3>obesity community screw up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my journalist friends who have been </v>

1796
01:31:35.821 --> 01:31:39.660
<v Speaker 3>covering this field screwed up that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>got the wrong story.</v>

1797
01:31:39.690 --> 01:31:44.690
<v Speaker 3>They missed the story that I found and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants to think like that.</v>

1798
01:31:45.391 --> 01:31:47.070
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to think you're bad at </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you do.</v>

1799
01:31:47.071 --> 01:31:49.680
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1800
01:31:49.681 --> 01:31:52.590
<v Speaker 3>friends or writing articles about me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1801
01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:58.870
<v Speaker 3>one woman journalist in Boston or used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a good friend who thought it was </v>

1802
01:31:58.870 --> 01:32:01.330
<v Speaker 3>one of the five best writers in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

1803
01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:05.650
<v Speaker 3>science journalists in the country until</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a piece that came to a different</v>

1804
01:32:05.651 --> 01:32:10.300
<v Speaker 3>conclusion than a book she had written </v>
<v Speaker 3>on obesity and the headline and Newsweek</v>

1805
01:32:10.301 --> 01:32:13.390
<v Speaker 3>was it not the carbs stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1806
01:32:13.390 --> 01:32:18.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the center for science in the public </v>

1807
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:19.840
<v Speaker 3>interest did a piece called big fat lies</v>
<v Speaker 3>cover of their newspaper.</v>

1808
01:32:19.841 --> 01:32:23.260
<v Speaker 3>Basically explaining how I had screwed </v>
<v Speaker 3>up on everything I had screwed up.</v>

1809
01:32:23.261 --> 01:32:26.590
<v Speaker 3>Another journalist who had written a </v>
<v Speaker 3>book on obesity,</v>

1810
01:32:26.591 --> 01:32:31.330
<v Speaker 3>did a piece for reason magazine about </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the ways I had screwed up.</v>

1811
01:32:31.331 --> 01:32:36.331
<v Speaker 3>And Luckily I hadn't screwed up in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them so I could get back at them and </v>

1812
01:32:36.331 --> 01:32:36.331
<v Speaker 3>take them down.</v>

1813
01:32:36.331 --> 01:32:37.810
<v Speaker 1>But when you did get back at them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take them down,</v>

1814
01:32:37.811 --> 01:32:39.510
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a time where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

1815
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:41.710
<v Speaker 3>year was this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was 2002.</v>

1816
01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:44.530
<v Speaker 3>So you had a blog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you have none of that?</v>

1817
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:49.590
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well did you publish a center for </v>

1818
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:50.620
<v Speaker 3>Science?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the public interest piece,</v>

1819
01:32:50.621 --> 01:32:55.621
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't even let me respond.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reason magazine was interesting.</v>

1820
01:32:56.650 --> 01:32:59.020
<v Speaker 3>I called up the editors and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1821
01:32:59.021 --> 01:33:03.970
<v Speaker 3>this is just complete bullshit and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>got to let me respond.</v>

1822
01:33:03.971 --> 01:33:04.660
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1823
01:33:04.661 --> 01:33:06.700
<v Speaker 3>they didn't care because they put it </v>
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>

1824
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:09.550
<v Speaker 3>So with the is going to write for them </v>
<v Speaker 3>for free,</v>

1825
01:33:09.551 --> 01:33:11.170
<v Speaker 3>let them write for them for free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1826
01:33:11.171 --> 01:33:13.490
<v Speaker 3>and the more controversy brings more </v>
<v Speaker 3>readers.</v>

1827
01:33:13.491 --> 01:33:17.110
<v Speaker 3>So I spent the weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I wrote like a 9,000</v>

1828
01:33:17.111 --> 01:33:20.260
<v Speaker 3>word response and there's still some </v>
<v Speaker 3>great stuff in there were,</v>

1829
01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:23.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the very end of this thing,</v>

1830
01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:25.720
<v Speaker 3>I was pointing out every way this guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>had screwed up,</v>

1831
01:33:25.721 --> 01:33:30.340
<v Speaker 3>like taken down my article by saying I </v>
<v Speaker 3>made mistakes when he was the one making</v>

1832
01:33:30.341 --> 01:33:35.140
<v Speaker 3>mistakes in that last line was something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he had called my editor who had now</v>

1833
01:33:35.141 --> 01:33:40.141
<v Speaker 3>bought this book for a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had called my editor on the gate use </v>

1834
01:33:40.141 --> 01:33:44.731
<v Speaker 3>the last night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called them Richard Seagull or </v>

1835
01:33:44.731 --> 01:33:45.400
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the last line of the book wasn't just</v>

1836
01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:48.680
<v Speaker 3>the final word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My editor's name is not Richard Segal,</v>

1837
01:33:48.681 --> 01:33:50.540
<v Speaker 3>it's John Period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1838
01:33:50.650 --> 01:33:55.650
<v Speaker 3>9,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>word takedown and this guy ended up </v>

1839
01:33:55.650 --> 01:33:57.210
<v Speaker 3>never writing for reason magazine again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either graduations.</v>

1840
01:33:57.220 --> 01:33:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got rid of an asshole.</v>

1841
01:33:58.930 --> 01:33:59.260
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1842
01:33:59.450 --> 01:34:04.450
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the human ego is shocking and </v>

1843
01:34:04.450 --> 01:34:07.961
<v Speaker 1>horrifying because that's the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why someone would look at what </v>

1844
01:34:07.961 --> 01:34:11.651
<v Speaker 1>you wrote and step back and look at what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wrote and decide to attack.</v>

1845
01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Instead of deciding to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1846
01:34:13.371 --> 01:34:18.200
<v Speaker 1>this guy went deep with this research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to really look at this and I need</v>

1847
01:34:18.201 --> 01:34:23.201
<v Speaker 1>to really find out whether or not I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been incorrect and I need to really </v>

1848
01:34:23.201 --> 01:34:25.280
<v Speaker 1>reevaluate what kind of advice I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving to humans.</v>

1849
01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Think about the hundreds of thousands or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even millions of people that have </v>

1850
01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:34.061
<v Speaker 1>read articles from these people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave them poor advice and that advice </v>

1851
01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:37.010
<v Speaker 1>adversely affected their health </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly.</v>

1852
01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1853
01:34:37.511 --> 01:34:37.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1854
01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:42.970
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which that instead they cover their ass </v>

1855
01:34:42.970 --> 01:34:44.000
<v Speaker 1>enough program could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are wave that's remembering,</v>

1856
01:34:44.001 --> 01:34:45.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dietary mushrooms.</v>

1857
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:49.410
<v Speaker 3>We're a member of my brothers is at low </v>
<v Speaker 3>dose asset thing,</v>

1858
01:34:49.411 --> 01:34:52.040
<v Speaker 3>so it's like I could really transform my</v>
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>

1859
01:34:52.041 --> 01:34:53.630
<v Speaker 3>I could become a different person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1860
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:56.120
<v Speaker 3>Have you tried it before?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1861
01:34:56.150 --> 01:34:58.460
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little that I'll become a.</v>

1862
01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:00.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's going to happen.</v>

1863
01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:02.270
<v Speaker 3>I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1864
01:35:02.690 --> 01:35:07.690
<v Speaker 3>let me know after the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to have to be able to get to </v>

1865
01:35:07.690 --> 01:35:07.690
<v Speaker 3>burbank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Burbank on acid.</v>

1866
01:35:07.690 --> 01:35:08.480
<v Speaker 3>Best Way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

01:35:08.481 --> 01:35:09.420
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1868
01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Instinctively know where Jay Leno's </v>
<v Speaker 3>garage is?</v>

1869
01:35:11.890 --> 01:35:13.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like a beacon,</v>

1870
01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:18.620
<v Speaker 3>like seat above.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how you have a three d map and </v>

1871
01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:18.620
<v Speaker 3>it's got that little balloon where your </v>
<v Speaker 3>relocation.</v>

1872
01:35:18.650 --> 01:35:19.490
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were there.</v>

1873
01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:22.520
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live in Oakland.</v>

1874
01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:25.250
<v Speaker 3>We don't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't need help with cyber up.</v>

1875
01:35:25.251 --> 01:35:26.600
<v Speaker 3>There were good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1876
01:35:26.601 --> 01:35:27.260
<v Speaker 3>um.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1877
01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:28.640
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1878
01:35:28.641 --> 01:35:33.641
<v Speaker 3>it's a natural human tendency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wish you wish somebody would say,</v>

1879
01:35:35.630 --> 01:35:37.310
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never thought of this.</v>

1880
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:39.140
<v Speaker 3>That's all they need to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to say,</v>

1881
01:35:39.141 --> 01:35:42.710
<v Speaker 3>we never thought of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an interesting take.</v>

1882
01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:46.520
<v Speaker 3>Clearly the editors at the New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>Times magazine are really smart.</v>

1883
01:35:46.521 --> 01:35:51.521
<v Speaker 3>People thought this was interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact checkers fact check that </v>

1884
01:35:51.521 --> 01:35:56.171
<v Speaker 3>there's no mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why at least I was safe there </v>

1885
01:35:56.171 --> 01:35:56.720
<v Speaker 3>because they're really good fact checker</v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't rely on me.</v>

1886
01:35:57.890 --> 01:35:58.700
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we,</v>

1887
01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:03.220
<v Speaker 3>and it just doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1888
01:36:03.221 --> 01:36:08.221
<v Speaker 3>it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even afterwards I start doing this book </v>

1889
01:36:08.221 --> 01:36:12.840
<v Speaker 3>and now I'm going to interview hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 3>more people and you would expect that a </v>

1890
01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:16.231
<v Speaker 3>lot of the scientists aren't going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to me because they're going to be </v>

1891
01:36:16.231 --> 01:36:17.170
<v Speaker 3>so mad at me about this article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most of them actually were good.</v>

1892
01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:22.171
<v Speaker 3>There was one scientist I wanted to talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>to specifically because a guy I was </v>

1893
01:36:22.171 --> 01:36:24.340
<v Speaker 3>talking to said he hated your article.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was total crap,</v>

1894
01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:27.070
<v Speaker 3>so I sent him an email and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1895
01:36:27.130 --> 01:36:30.190
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to interview you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm right here.</v>

1896
01:36:30.191 --> 01:36:32.590
<v Speaker 3>He thought the article was total crap </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'd like to know why,</v>

1897
01:36:32.591 --> 01:36:37.591
<v Speaker 3>because if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to make sure I don't make those </v>

1898
01:36:37.591 --> 01:36:37.591
<v Speaker 3>mistakes again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1899
01:36:37.591 --> 01:36:42.031
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as you make sure you check all </v>

1900
01:36:42.031 --> 01:36:42.190
<v Speaker 3>my quotes because I don't trust you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get my quotes right,</v>

1901
01:36:42.191 --> 01:36:47.191
<v Speaker 3>because that was another story that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going around at the time and two weeks </v>

1902
01:36:48.511 --> 01:36:50.880
<v Speaker 3>later we get on the phone and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1903
01:36:50.881 --> 01:36:52.050
<v Speaker 3>I got to apologize</v>

1904
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:58.760
<v Speaker 3>when I read your article was so pissed </v>
<v Speaker 3>off by the title,</v>

1905
01:36:58.761 --> 01:37:03.410
<v Speaker 3>what if it's all been a big fat lie and </v>
<v Speaker 3>your holier than now smarter than we are</v>

1906
01:37:03.411 --> 01:37:08.390
<v Speaker 3>at attitude that I never actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought deeply about what you're saying.</v>

1907
01:37:09.230 --> 01:37:14.230
<v Speaker 3>And I pretty much agree with you now </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've read it again in context is </v>

1908
01:37:14.781 --> 01:37:16.850
<v Speaker 3>everything in these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1909
01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:19.250
<v Speaker 3>And I noticed that when I lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I give a lot of lectures.</v>

1910
01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:21.650
<v Speaker 3>I talked to the grand rounds and medical</v>
<v Speaker 3>schools.</v>

1911
01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:27.250
<v Speaker 3>If somebody introduces me to a room full</v>
<v Speaker 3>of doctors is this is a very well </v>

1912
01:37:27.250 --> 01:37:29.300
<v Speaker 3>respected journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's won all these awards,</v>

1913
01:37:29.301 --> 01:37:31.490
<v Speaker 3>including these influential public </v>
<v Speaker 3>health awards.</v>

1914
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:36.020
<v Speaker 3>He's written this incredibly thoughtful </v>
<v Speaker 3>provoking book and we managed to get him</v>

1915
01:37:36.021 --> 01:37:41.000
<v Speaker 3>here to give you the arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The doctors will be completely receptive</v>

1916
01:37:41.001 --> 01:37:44.540
<v Speaker 3>to everything I say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've also had people introduce me as,</v>

1917
01:37:44.541 --> 01:37:45.950
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's this Guy Taubes.</v>

1918
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:47.360
<v Speaker 3>He wrote this big book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>

1919
01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:50.270
<v Speaker 3>everything we say is wrong and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to give a lecture,</v>

1920
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:53.000
<v Speaker 3>and now it's like they're tuned out from</v>
<v Speaker 3>day one.</v>

1921
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:58.030
<v Speaker 3>From the moment I opened my mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're looking for reasons not to </v>

1922
01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:58.430
<v Speaker 3>believe a word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just crossed post sitting.</v>

1923
01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they're looking at the phones </v>

1924
01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:03.920
<v Speaker 3>five minutes later and checking their </v>
<v Speaker 3>email.</v>

1925
01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:08.330
<v Speaker 3>It sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So context is everything and by making </v>

1926
01:38:08.731 --> 01:38:13.731
<v Speaker 3>this article as controversial as it </v>
<v Speaker 3>could with putting actions in the lead </v>

1927
01:38:13.731 --> 01:38:18.020
<v Speaker 3>and porterhouse steak on the cover and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what if it's all been a big fat lie and </v>

1928
01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:20.430
<v Speaker 3>I actually wasn't calling it a lie as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of mistaken assumptions,</v>

1929
01:38:20.431 --> 01:38:22.980
<v Speaker 3>a lot of bad science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nobody lied.</v>

1930
01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.420
<v Speaker 3>Did you create it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the title?</v>

1931
01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:25.880
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't.</v>

1932
01:38:25.890 --> 01:38:26.940
<v Speaker 3>That's always what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1933
01:38:26.941 --> 01:38:30.000
<v Speaker 3>I didn't reject it on there so I get </v>
<v Speaker 3>right title,</v>

1934
01:38:30.150 --> 01:38:30.900
<v Speaker 3>but that's the thing.</v>

1935
01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:35.900
<v Speaker 3>So it got me a big book advance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It made it exceedingly controversial,</v>

1936
01:38:36.690 --> 01:38:41.690
<v Speaker 3>but it turned a lot of people off </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were being accused of </v>

1937
01:38:41.690 --> 01:38:43.200
<v Speaker 3>things they didn't want to think of </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

1938
01:38:43.201 --> 01:38:45.510
<v Speaker 3>especially the lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well perhaps the dam,</v>

1939
01:38:45.630 --> 01:38:50.630
<v Speaker 3>but initially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but over the course of time it's got a </v>

1940
01:38:50.630 --> 01:38:54.831
<v Speaker 3>lot of support behind it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so many people you've been </v>

1941
01:38:54.831 --> 01:38:55.710
<v Speaker 3>recommended to me by at least a half a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dozen people that I deeply respect.</v>

1942
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:57.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing.</v>

1943
01:38:57.271 --> 01:39:02.271
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an extraordinarily powerful </v>

1944
01:39:02.271 --> 01:39:03.360
<v Speaker 3>intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you experience and you weren't even</v>

1945
01:39:03.361 --> 01:39:04.650
<v Speaker 3>overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1946
01:39:04.651 --> 01:39:06.510
<v Speaker 3>this is a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1947
01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:11.600
<v Speaker 3>Two things that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I talked to my colleagues about </v>

1948
01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:15.771
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say it's like you're playing in a </v>

1949
01:39:15.771 --> 01:39:18.051
<v Speaker 3>poker game with a thousand people in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>establishment and they cheat because </v>

1950
01:39:18.421 --> 01:39:23.421
<v Speaker 3>they all talk to each other and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>share cards and they show each other </v>

1951
01:39:23.421 --> 01:39:23.421
<v Speaker 3>what they get.</v>

1952
01:39:23.421 --> 01:39:24.210
<v Speaker 3>They tell them what they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bet,</v>

1953
01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:29.840
<v Speaker 3>but God keeps stealing you for aces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got the best hand,</v>

1954
01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:35.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the best hand is you shift your </v>

1955
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.120
<v Speaker 3>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get rid of the carbs and you replace</v>

1956
01:39:36.121 --> 01:39:39.690
<v Speaker 3>them with fat and it does remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 3>things to most people.</v>

1957
01:39:39.810 --> 01:39:41.620
<v Speaker 3>Not all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1958
01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:44.340
<v Speaker 3>Because I want to talk to the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it doesn't work on.</v>

1959
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:49.550
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know what they're actually </v>

1960
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:50.040
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with people when they,</v>

1961
01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1962
01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:53.370
<v Speaker 3>it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so subjective and it's also,</v>

1963
01:39:53.371 --> 01:39:55.860
<v Speaker 3>you don't exactly know how they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1964
01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:56.590
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1965
01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:00.240
<v Speaker 3>what their diet is like in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>how would they cutting out carbs,</v>

1966
01:40:00.241 --> 01:40:01.590
<v Speaker 3>what kind of nutrients are they taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>in?</v>

1967
01:40:01.591 --> 01:40:03.920
<v Speaker 3>What's or what's the rest like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sleep.</v>

1968
01:40:03.921 --> 01:40:05.220
<v Speaker 3>Are they getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

1969
01:40:05.221 --> 01:40:06.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend,</v>

1970
01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:09.450
<v Speaker 3>a diet book author.</v>

1971
01:40:09.450 --> 01:40:11.610
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the smartest doctors out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1972
01:40:11.611 --> 01:40:13.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever he says,</v>

1973
01:40:13.021 --> 01:40:16.080
<v Speaker 3>it's always worth listening to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He believes that when people fail in the</v>

1974
01:40:16.081 --> 01:40:17.520
<v Speaker 3>die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter what age they are,</v>

1975
01:40:17.521 --> 01:40:22.521
<v Speaker 3>what sex they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the Diet doesn't return them to a </v>

1976
01:40:22.681 --> 01:40:27.681
<v Speaker 3>relatively healthy weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he believes it's because they're not </v>

1977
01:40:27.681 --> 01:40:30.870
<v Speaker 3>conforming to the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with him actually,</v>

1978
01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:32.050
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has more.</v>

1979
01:40:32.170 --> 01:40:33.450
<v Speaker 3>Any Diet period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1980
01:40:33.451 --> 01:40:35.880
<v Speaker 3>the low carb high fat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

1981
01:40:35.881 --> 01:40:40.881
<v Speaker 3>maybe they're reading too many nuts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's carbs and nuts or maybe they're </v>

1982
01:40:40.881 --> 01:40:44.211
<v Speaker 3>lying to him about what they're doing or</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're still having the occasional </v>

1983
01:40:44.211 --> 01:40:47.040
<v Speaker 3>sweet and clearly there are people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to compromise on these diets.</v>

1984
01:40:47.070 --> 01:40:52.070
<v Speaker 3>If I compromise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've been hearing so long that </v>

1985
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.070
<v Speaker 3>fat is bad for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

1986
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:53.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I'm going to restrict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1987
01:40:53.741 --> 01:40:57.700
<v Speaker 3>sugar and grain and starches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also gonna restrict fat.</v>

1988
01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:02.230
<v Speaker 3>Now you're reading skinless chicken </v>
<v Speaker 3>breasts with green vegetables and you're</v>

1989
01:41:02.231 --> 01:41:05.680
<v Speaker 3>not even putting butter on it and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>tastes awful and nobody's going to stick</v>

1990
01:41:05.681 --> 01:41:10.681
<v Speaker 3>to that diet anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in order to give the skinless </v>

1991
01:41:10.681 --> 01:41:13.060
<v Speaker 3>chicken breast some flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to marinate in some sugar,</v>

1992
01:41:14.230 --> 01:41:15.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1993
01:41:15.401 --> 01:41:20.401
<v Speaker 3>and the protein and they didn't wanna </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat a high protein diet because you're </v>

1994
01:41:20.401 --> 01:41:23.521
<v Speaker 3>going to convert the protein to glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of those amino acids and that's </v>

1995
01:41:23.521 --> 01:41:23.920
<v Speaker 3>going to raise blood sugar and that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a problem.</v>

1996
01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:29.460
<v Speaker 3>So maybe they're just doing them wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are a lot of hormones that </v>

1997
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.000
<v Speaker 3>influence fat accumulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is rumors had the Germans and </v>

1998
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.060
<v Speaker 3>Austrians had concluded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I didn't say this,</v>

1999
01:41:37.061 --> 01:41:39.700
<v Speaker 3>I can't even remember what I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing this book tour,</v>

2000
01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:43.540
<v Speaker 3>so I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Germans and Austrians Research said,</v>

2001
01:41:43.541 --> 01:41:48.541
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this has got to be a hormonal metabolic </v>

2002
01:41:48.541 --> 01:41:48.541
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

2003
01:41:48.541 --> 01:41:48.541
<v Speaker 3>The whole idea that it's just calories </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2004
01:41:48.541 --> 01:41:53.251
<v Speaker 3>calories out is it's an explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like somebody gets heavier,</v>

2005
01:41:53.410 --> 01:41:55.210
<v Speaker 3>they take in more calories than they </v>
<v Speaker 3>expend.</v>

2006
01:41:55.240 --> 01:42:00.000
<v Speaker 3>We know that it's like somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>accumulate energy and their fat tissue,</v>

2007
01:42:00.010 --> 01:42:01.780
<v Speaker 3>they were accumulating energy in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>

2008
01:42:01.781 --> 01:42:04.740
<v Speaker 3>which means they're taking in energy </v>
<v Speaker 3>more than they expected.</v>

2009
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:06.550
<v Speaker 3>That's just a description of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>

2010
01:42:06.551 --> 01:42:10.210
<v Speaker 3>It says nothing about why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know they're clearly.</v>

2011
01:42:10.211 --> 01:42:13.870
<v Speaker 3>Hormones play a huge role in fat </v>
<v Speaker 3>accumulation or men and women would look</v>

2012
01:42:13.871 --> 01:42:16.060
<v Speaker 3>identical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2013
01:42:16.061 --> 01:42:20.980
<v Speaker 3>so boys go through puberty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they lose fat and gain muscle.</v>

2014
01:42:21.340 --> 01:42:25.330
<v Speaker 3>Girls go through puberty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they gained fat and very specific places</v>

2015
01:42:25.331 --> 01:42:27.100
<v Speaker 3>like not everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2016
01:42:27.101 --> 01:42:32.101
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's designed to drive the boys crazy </v>

2017
01:42:32.101 --> 01:42:33.400
<v Speaker 3>and get some procreation going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's all hormonal.</v>

2018
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:36.880
<v Speaker 3>It's all estrogen and the girls </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone and the boys,</v>

2019
01:42:36.881 --> 01:42:38.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little mix going on.</v>

2020
01:42:39.190 --> 01:42:41.440
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter how many calories </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're consuming,</v>

2021
01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:45.000
<v Speaker 3>so these Germans and Austrians would say</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2022
01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:47.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's clearly a hormonal thing.</v>

2023
01:42:47.250 --> 01:42:52.250
<v Speaker 3>I meant the only way you could explain </v>
<v Speaker 3>obesity is a hormonal dysregulation,</v>

2024
01:42:52.271 --> 01:42:57.040
<v Speaker 3>and then in the sixties we learned that </v>
<v Speaker 3>insulin controls fat accumulation,</v>

2025
01:42:57.041 --> 01:43:02.041
<v Speaker 3>dominant hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these other hormones play a role as </v>

2026
01:43:02.041 --> 01:43:02.770
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So stress hormones play a role,</v>

2027
01:43:02.771 --> 01:43:07.771
<v Speaker 3>and sex hormones play a role,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so estrogen and testosterone both </v>

2028
01:43:07.771 --> 01:43:12.600
<v Speaker 3>inhibit an enzyme called lipoprotein </v>
<v Speaker 3>lipase that when it's on your fat cells </v>

2029
01:43:14.050 --> 01:43:19.050
<v Speaker 3>basically pulls fat out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>circulation and into the cell.</v>

2030
01:43:19.330 --> 01:43:24.330
<v Speaker 3>That's a simplistic way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you're pumping out estrogen and </v>

2031
01:43:24.330 --> 01:43:28.981
<v Speaker 3>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're inhibiting this enzyme which </v>

2032
01:43:28.981 --> 01:43:29.290
<v Speaker 3>inhibits fat accumulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you get older,</v>

2033
01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:33.070
<v Speaker 3>you secrete less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These hormones,</v>

2034
01:43:33.071 --> 01:43:37.000
<v Speaker 3>women go through menopause,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they secrete less estrogen.</v>

2035
01:43:37.001 --> 01:43:41.290
<v Speaker 3>The light bulb protein lipase is </v>
<v Speaker 3>upregulated on their fat cells,</v>

2036
01:43:41.291 --> 01:43:44.200
<v Speaker 3>so you get more of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it just starts accumulating fat.</v>

2037
01:43:44.230 --> 01:43:46.690
<v Speaker 3>No matter how much the woman wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat or exercise,</v>

2038
01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:49.570
<v Speaker 3>and this is why they put on fat when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they get older.</v>

2039
01:43:49.570 --> 01:43:52.940
<v Speaker 3>I think women are program to put on fat </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're pregnant.</v>

2040
01:43:52.941 --> 01:43:55.340
<v Speaker 3>Men are never really programmed to put </v>
<v Speaker 3>on fat,</v>

2041
01:43:55.580 --> 01:44:00.580
<v Speaker 3>but women have a fat accumulation </v>
<v Speaker 3>program when they're pregnant and it </v>

2042
01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:04.901
<v Speaker 3>sort of kicks in a little bit as they go</v>
<v Speaker 3>through menopause until I think </v>

2043
01:44:04.901 --> 01:44:06.580
<v Speaker 3>historically when you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>anecdotal evidence,</v>

2044
01:44:06.590 --> 01:44:07.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2045
01:44:07.821 --> 01:44:12.320
<v Speaker 3>older women have a much harder time </v>
<v Speaker 3>losing excess body fat,</v>

2046
01:44:12.321 --> 01:44:17.321
<v Speaker 3>even on very calorie carbohydrate </v>
<v Speaker 3>restricted ketogenetic diets and it </v>

2047
01:44:17.321 --> 01:44:22.220
<v Speaker 3>would be completely understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the argument I make is that the,</v>

2048
01:44:22.221 --> 01:44:24.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would still be the best diet,</v>

2049
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:27.350
<v Speaker 3>still be the leanest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could be,</v>

2050
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:33.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all intents and purposes by getting </v>

2051
01:44:33.790 --> 01:44:36.761
<v Speaker 3>rid of carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does not mean that it's gonna </v>

2052
01:44:36.761 --> 01:44:38.920
<v Speaker 3>work or it's going to work as much as </v>
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to because of these other </v>

2053
01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:41.510
<v Speaker 3>sex hormones and the influence on body </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat as well.</v>

2054
01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:45.080
<v Speaker 3>And perhaps the only way to adjust that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be extreme exercise,</v>

2055
01:44:45.081 --> 01:44:50.081
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like then don't have to go crazy </v>

2056
01:44:50.081 --> 01:44:50.081
<v Speaker 3>crossfit or start running up hills with </v>
<v Speaker 3>weights on them.</v>

2057
01:44:50.081 --> 01:44:50.180
<v Speaker 3>Something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2058
01:44:51.730 --> 01:44:54.320
<v Speaker 3>And that's a question I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that wouldn't address it.</v>

2059
01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:58.040
<v Speaker 3>That would be sort of a temporary fix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2060
01:44:58.041 --> 01:45:01.700
<v Speaker 3>So you might be able to stimulate some </v>
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>

2061
01:45:01.701 --> 01:45:03.590
<v Speaker 3>even testosterone production,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2062
01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:07.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but temporary fix,</v>

2063
01:45:07.081 --> 01:45:09.340
<v Speaker 3>unless you continue that activity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2064
01:45:09.341 --> 01:45:10.130
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is,</v>

2065
01:45:10.131 --> 01:45:12.530
<v Speaker 3>if it may be virtually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2066
01:45:12.531 --> 01:45:13.160
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2067
01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:16.670
<v Speaker 3>here's my issue with Cri.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2068
01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:22.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a harvard psychologist in the </v>

2069
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:27.140
<v Speaker 3>50 forties and fifties named William </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sheldon who came up with this idea.</v>

2070
01:45:27.141 --> 01:45:28.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Need some googling here,</v>

2071
01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:33.760
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have three different fundamental body </v>

2072
01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:37.631
<v Speaker 3>types.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's an echo more Sunday mezzo </v>

2073
01:45:37.631 --> 01:45:37.631
<v Speaker 3>morph.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2074
01:45:37.631 --> 01:45:39.500
<v Speaker 3>what was the endomorph which is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>obese one,</v>

2075
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:40.730
<v Speaker 3>endomorph endomorph.</v>

2076
01:45:40.730 --> 01:45:42.870
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and which the thin what act?</v>

2077
01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:45.080
<v Speaker 3>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can no more,</v>

2078
01:45:45.410 --> 01:45:49.180
<v Speaker 3>you could starve an ectomorph and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't turn them into an,</v>

2079
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:52.680
<v Speaker 3>you can starve an endo more if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn them into an Ectomorph,</v>

2080
01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:55.070
<v Speaker 3>you turn them into an a macerated </v>
<v Speaker 3>endomorph.</v>

2081
01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:57.530
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you cannot.</v>

2082
01:45:57.610 --> 01:46:00.130
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if it was his metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mine,</v>

2083
01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:02.840
<v Speaker 3>I forget now you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't starve a basset hound and turn</v>

2084
01:46:02.841 --> 01:46:06.140
<v Speaker 3>it into a greyhound and you just end up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a basset hound.</v>

2085
01:46:06.170 --> 01:46:11.170
<v Speaker 3>Genetic factors determined by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment with our ancestors </v>

2086
01:46:11.170 --> 01:46:11.170
<v Speaker 3>developed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2087
01:46:11.170 --> 01:46:13.250
<v Speaker 3>and the environment in the mother's womb</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

2088
01:46:13.251 --> 01:46:15.440
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2089
01:46:15.441 --> 01:46:17.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not necessarily,</v>

2090
01:46:17.091 --> 01:46:22.091
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic and it certainly biological </v>

2091
01:46:22.091 --> 01:46:22.091
<v Speaker 3>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows,</v>

2092
01:46:22.091 --> 01:46:22.091
<v Speaker 3>maybe that gut biome is involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I doubt it.</v>

2093
01:46:22.091 --> 01:46:24.380
<v Speaker 3>But there's also the shapes of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodies are radically different.</v>

2094
01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:27.020
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing with the shoulders and </v>
<v Speaker 3>morphs.</v>

2095
01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:27.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2096
01:46:27.771 --> 01:46:29.070
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My brother was an actor.</v>

2097
01:46:29.071 --> 01:46:34.071
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was always tall and thin and he got </v>

2098
01:46:34.071 --> 01:46:35.540
<v Speaker 3>one 95.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was buff,</v>

2099
01:46:35.541 --> 01:46:40.541
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could put on muscle much easier than </v>

2100
01:46:40.541 --> 01:46:40.541
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could put on fat.</v>

2101
01:46:40.541 --> 01:46:44.950
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend who was a taekwondo </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion in the eighties and he was six </v>

2102
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:46.580
<v Speaker 3>foot two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six foot maybe three.</v>

2103
01:46:46.850 --> 01:46:49.190
<v Speaker 3>And he fought at 147 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2104
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:51.970
<v Speaker 3>And you wouldn't get anywhere from six </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

2105
01:46:52.010 --> 01:46:53.430
<v Speaker 3>When I start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll start with,</v>

2106
01:46:53.431 --> 01:46:56.670
<v Speaker 3>I'll starve to death at one 75.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was in his hands.</v>

2107
01:46:56.671 --> 01:47:00.070
<v Speaker 3>It was in the shape of his face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was very narrow feet everything.</v>

2108
01:47:00.071 --> 01:47:01.590
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's how his body.</v>

2109
01:47:01.591 --> 01:47:05.670
<v Speaker 3>So part of this alternative hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I find so you know,</v>

2110
01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:07.320
<v Speaker 3>we believe today is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2111
01:47:07.321 --> 01:47:12.321
<v Speaker 3>the conventional thinking is how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>are we next besides drives,</v>

2112
01:47:12.811 --> 01:47:14.190
<v Speaker 3>how much fat do you accumulate?</v>

2113
01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:18.840
<v Speaker 3>And the alternative hypothesis is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>how much fat you accumulate is very well</v>

2114
01:47:18.841 --> 01:47:23.841
<v Speaker 3>regulated by the human body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other you could change that regulation </v>

2115
01:47:23.841 --> 01:47:27.291
<v Speaker 3>by changing the macronutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people who fat tissue doesn't want to</v>

2116
01:47:27.631 --> 01:47:30.210
<v Speaker 3>accumulate fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are constitutionally lean.</v>

2117
01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:34.890
<v Speaker 3>Your body when they eat a meal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't store it as fat temporarily.</v>

2118
01:47:34.891 --> 01:47:39.891
<v Speaker 3>They get a burn all those calories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the way they'd burn it in prior to </v>

2119
01:47:39.891 --> 01:47:40.950
<v Speaker 3>the 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a clinician studying obese,</v>

2120
01:47:40.951 --> 01:47:43.260
<v Speaker 3>you talked about the impulse to physical</v>
<v Speaker 3>activity.</v>

2121
01:47:44.010 --> 01:47:47.820
<v Speaker 3>So you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know Lance Armstrong eats a thousand</v>

2122
01:47:47.821 --> 01:47:52.050
<v Speaker 3>calories of pasta and his body doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to store it as fat.</v>

2123
01:47:52.051 --> 01:47:57.051
<v Speaker 3>It wants to burn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he goes for three hour bike ride </v>

2124
01:47:57.051 --> 01:47:59.871
<v Speaker 3>after lunch because his body's trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>desperately to get rid of those calories</v>

2125
01:48:00.361 --> 01:48:04.110
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't want a storm is fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have the thousand calories a pasta,</v>

2126
01:48:04.111 --> 01:48:07.560
<v Speaker 3>my body's happy storing fat and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>asleep an hour later.</v>

2127
01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:12.870
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not thicker and fatter than </v>
<v Speaker 3>Armstrong because I'm asleep.</v>

2128
01:48:13.110 --> 01:48:16.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm asleep because that's the way my </v>
<v Speaker 3>body processed carbs.</v>

2129
01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:22.520
<v Speaker 3>But is that a case of nature or nurture?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nature.</v>

2130
01:48:23.090 --> 01:48:24.330
<v Speaker 3>Hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's.</v>

2131
01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:29.331
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not because the nurture part is </v>

2132
01:48:29.331 --> 01:48:31.401
<v Speaker 3>healthy diet influences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I have exclusively fat and </v>

2133
01:48:31.401 --> 01:48:35.601
<v Speaker 3>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm eating a key to genic diet that </v>

2134
01:48:35.601 --> 01:48:38.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm minimizing fat accumulation of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>body wants to burn more calories.</v>

2135
01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:43.280
<v Speaker 3>So I am closer to being a lance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Lance Armstrong can be lean on his </v>

2136
01:48:44.730 --> 01:48:49.380
<v Speaker 3>high carb diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am closer to being Lance Armstrong,</v>

2137
01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:53.250
<v Speaker 3>like closest on a diet to absent doll </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates.</v>

2138
01:48:53.850 --> 01:48:55.650
<v Speaker 3>But I'm still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2139
01:48:55.651 --> 01:48:57.600
<v Speaker 3>now I'm just a bigger individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2140
01:48:57.601 --> 01:48:59.280
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about,</v>

2141
01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:01.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2142
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:07.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a friend of mine who </v>

2143
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.650
<v Speaker 3>was a freshman manager of my college </v>
<v Speaker 3>football team.</v>

2144
01:49:07.651 --> 01:49:08.670
<v Speaker 3>So this was harvard.</v>

2145
01:49:08.670 --> 01:49:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was division two football.</v>

2146
01:49:10.621 --> 01:49:12.880
<v Speaker 3>It was a lot of smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2147
01:49:13.530 --> 01:49:15.800
<v Speaker 3>guys who couldn't make it in division </v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

2148
01:49:15.810 --> 01:49:20.810
<v Speaker 3>We had kids who went to Harvard because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't get scholarships at Holy </v>

2149
01:49:20.810 --> 01:49:20.810
<v Speaker 3>Cross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they went,</v>

2150
01:49:20.810 --> 01:49:21.270
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll play football for Harvard.</v>

2151
01:49:21.271 --> 01:49:24.870
<v Speaker 3>They were local 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>76.</v>

2152
01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:27.510
<v Speaker 3>My senior year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest kid on our team,</v>

2153
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:32.990
<v Speaker 3>Danny tickets weighed 265 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six foot five from our standards.</v>

2154
01:49:33.781 --> 01:49:38.781
<v Speaker 3>Who was enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went off to play for the Chicago </v>

2155
01:49:38.781 --> 01:49:41.211
<v Speaker 3>bears for five or six years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we had one other offensive </v>

2156
01:49:41.211 --> 01:49:44.700
<v Speaker 3>lineman who was to 65 also six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>

2157
01:49:44.701 --> 01:49:45.570
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

2158
01:49:47.650 --> 01:49:51.280
<v Speaker 3>maybe two this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvard football team,</v>

2159
01:49:51.281 --> 01:49:54.190
<v Speaker 3>a smart kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same socioeconomic status.</v>

2160
01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:58.150
<v Speaker 3>The entire offense have they got I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 players over 300 pounds.</v>

2161
01:49:58.970 --> 01:50:01.810
<v Speaker 3>His cronies guys were enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are six slash seven,</v>

2162
01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:06.900
<v Speaker 3>300 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't grow people that big when I </v>

2163
01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:07.030
<v Speaker 3>was growing up.</v>

2164
01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:09.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean I could say maybe I didn't see </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

2165
01:50:10.630 --> 01:50:12.700
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they weren't around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they were six,</v>

2166
01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:15.730
<v Speaker 3>seven and they only weighed 2:30</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they weren't being bulked up.</v>

2167
01:50:15.731 --> 01:50:18.250
<v Speaker 3>So they were playing basketball instead </v>
<v Speaker 3>of football.</v>

2168
01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:23.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could imagine ways that that </v>

2169
01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:23.600
<v Speaker 3>confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but from our perception,</v>

2170
01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:28.231
<v Speaker 3>if you look just what happened when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a kid in early 19 sixties there,</v>

2171
01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:31.090
<v Speaker 3>as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was one,</v>

2172
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:36.390
<v Speaker 3>300 pounder in the NFL and the AFL,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two different leads back then.</v>

2173
01:50:37.121 --> 01:50:42.121
<v Speaker 3>Bob De remember his name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he played for the Boston Patriots and </v>

2174
01:50:42.121 --> 01:50:44.870
<v Speaker 3>his head was like small compared to his </v>
<v Speaker 3>body and he was a big fat guy.</v>

2175
01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:48.040
<v Speaker 3>You know what is there now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty,</v>

2176
01:50:48.041 --> 01:50:49.630
<v Speaker 3>30 per team.</v>

2177
01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a good example,</v>

2178
01:50:51.530 --> 01:50:56.530
<v Speaker 1>big George Foreman from 1970,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was when he fought Joe </v>

2179
01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Frazier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he only 217 pounds.</v>

2180
01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:01.030
<v Speaker 3>Is that George?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only way?</v>

2181
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when he came back,</v>

2182
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:06.110
<v Speaker 1>when he came back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he took a long time off,</v>

2183
01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:08.500
<v Speaker 1>he ate himself to be well over 300</v>

2184
01:51:10.210 --> 01:51:15.210
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the fat from the George Foreman </v>

2185
01:51:15.210 --> 01:51:15.210
<v Speaker 3>Grill</v>

2186
01:51:15.210 --> 01:51:19.510
<v Speaker 1>making low fat grows even after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but back in those days when he was a </v>

2187
01:51:19.541 --> 01:51:22.570
<v Speaker 1>terror before he fought Muhammad Ali,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's relatively small.</v>

2188
01:51:22.571 --> 01:51:27.571
<v Speaker 1>By today's standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at a UFC heavyweight </v>

2189
01:51:27.571 --> 01:51:27.571
<v Speaker 1>champions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steep emile chick,</v>

2190
01:51:27.571 --> 01:51:32.360
<v Speaker 1>I believe Steve a walks around about 240</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds and he's small compared to Brock </v>

2191
01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Lesnar who's 285 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like here's a good example that Jamie </v>

2192
01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:41.260
<v Speaker 1>just pulled up from 1927 guy blow your </v>
<v Speaker 1>nose man.</v>

2193
01:51:41.261 --> 01:51:43.650
<v Speaker 1>You figured me out the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2194
01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:45.640
<v Speaker 1>here everybody could hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>

2195
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:50.910
<v Speaker 1>they can hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 190 pounds Morris read but bad drew </v>

2196
01:51:52.661 --> 01:51:53.980
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you say that name B,</v>

2197
01:51:53.981 --> 01:51:55.360
<v Speaker 1>a d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>g,</v>

2198
01:51:55.420 --> 01:51:57.550
<v Speaker 1>r o bad bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That grow.</v>

2199
01:51:57.640 --> 01:51:59.700
<v Speaker 1>He's growing bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why he's only one 90.</v>

2200
01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:03.130
<v Speaker 1>He's six foot tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 90 and this is 19,</v>

2201
01:52:03.150 --> 01:52:08.150
<v Speaker 1>27.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He played offense and defense for the </v>

2202
01:52:08.150 --> 01:52:09.850
<v Speaker 1>New York giants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that guy is 10 pounds lighter than me</v>

2203
01:52:10.210 --> 01:52:11.440
<v Speaker 1>and I'm five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight.</v>

2204
01:52:12.010 --> 01:52:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's six foot tall and he's a pro </v>

2205
01:52:17.010 --> 01:52:17.010
<v Speaker 1>football player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking terrifying to me.</v>

2206
01:52:17.010 --> 01:52:20.320
<v Speaker 1>And then you go to 1967 and you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alan page.</v>

2207
01:52:20.321 --> 01:52:23.440
<v Speaker 1>He's six foot four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>245 pounds.</v>

2208
01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:28.470
<v Speaker 1>A relative giant in comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you go to 2006 and you have boy,</v>

2209
01:52:29.530 --> 01:52:31.740
<v Speaker 1>say that name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long have you got?</v>

2210
01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:32.590
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nada,</v>

2211
01:52:32.770 --> 01:52:33.790

2212
01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:39.120

<v Speaker 1>I think you don't pronounce the </v>

2213
01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Gentleman Pranab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She is.</v>

2214

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he is six foot four.</v>

2216
01:52:41.471 --> 01:52:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred 35 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a big old gut.</v>

2217
01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Him could lose some weight.</v>

2218
01:52:47.010 --> 01:52:49.370
<v Speaker 4>It's 45 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

2219
01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:51.170

<v Speaker 4>So He's a giant.</v>

2220
01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:56.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean people are just starting left </v>
<v Speaker 4>tackle for the Dallas cowboys right now.</v>

2221
01:52:56.301 --> 01:52:59.540
<v Speaker 4>I forget his name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just Google left tackle.</v>

2222
01:52:59.541 --> 01:53:03.680

<v Speaker 4>boxers today.</v>

2223
01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:08.710
<v Speaker 4>Tyrone Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's good to get a picture of it as a </v>

2224
01:53:10.311 --> 01:53:11.630
<v Speaker 4>big fella.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2225
01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:14.780
<v Speaker 4>Shirt off without the shirt off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go.</v>

2226
01:53:14.781 --> 01:53:15.530
<v Speaker 4>Pornographic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2227
01:53:15.531 --> 01:53:16.520
<v Speaker 4>So they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2228
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:18.690
<v Speaker 4>people didn't exist like that when I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>growing.</v>

2229
01:53:19.050 --> 01:53:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this new heavyweight that's </v>

2230
01:53:24.050 --> 01:53:26.910
<v Speaker 1>fighting for the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is Francis in Ghana and he's </v>

2231
01:53:26.910 --> 01:53:28.750
<v Speaker 1>one of the most exciting prospects in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC right now.</v>

2232
01:53:28.751 --> 01:53:33.751
<v Speaker 1>He's a heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's undefeated and he is fucking </v>

2233
01:53:33.751 --> 01:53:33.751
<v Speaker 1>enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2234
01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:35.740
<v Speaker 1>he is probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2235
01:53:35.741 --> 01:53:37.960
<v Speaker 1>go to that picture right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That far left far left.</v>

2236
01:53:37.961 --> 01:53:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Jamie upper left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2237
01:53:39.250 --> 01:53:43.180
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is a giant man.</v>

2238
01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal knockout artists too.</v>

2239
01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:51.240
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me go to go see if there's a </v>

2240
01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:54.331
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia on his size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure he's super lean </v>

2241
01:53:54.331 --> 01:53:56.110
<v Speaker 1>around 2:45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2242
01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:58.480
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're six foot four.</v>

2243
01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:02.440
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't say his weight right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says waiting anywhere there.</v>

2244
01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:04.930
<v Speaker 4>Two 50.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seven to 57.</v>

2245
01:54:06.050 --> 01:54:07.600
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's 40.</v>

2246
01:54:07.601 --> 01:54:12.390
<v Speaker 4>He's 40 pounds heavier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That may or may not be correct as far as</v>

2247
01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:13.840
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but close in.</v>

2248
01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those guys where he walks </v>

2249
01:54:18.850 --> 01:54:19.790
<v Speaker 1>into the octagon and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I do commentary,</v>

2250
01:54:19.791 --> 01:54:22.220
<v Speaker 1>I sit at a desk that's touching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>octagon.</v>

2251
01:54:22.221 --> 01:54:23.930
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a desk,</v>

2252
01:54:23.931 --> 01:54:25.310
<v Speaker 1>my notes are on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in front of me.</v>

2253
01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:30.170
<v Speaker 1>When he walks into the octagon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can feel his footsteps on my hands.</v>

2254
01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:32.450
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's made out of stone.</v>

2255
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:35.150
<v Speaker 1>And then when he hits people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just Jesus Christ,</v>

2256
01:54:35.151 --> 01:54:37.400
<v Speaker 1>you see the look on their face when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>hits him,</v>

2257
01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:39.330
<v Speaker 1>see if he can find like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

2258
01:54:39.700 --> 01:54:43.510
<v Speaker 4>quick highlight reel of this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was interesting.</v>

2259
01:54:43.511 --> 01:54:44.170
<v Speaker 4>Some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2260
01:54:44.171 --> 01:54:46.990
<v Speaker 4>training has changed dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like even for sure George,</v>

2261
01:54:46.991 --> 01:54:48.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2262
01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:51.250
<v Speaker 4>boxers didn't lift,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't do resistance training,</v>

2263
01:54:51.251 --> 01:54:56.251
<v Speaker 4>didn't do any of the bags back thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he didn't want to slow them </v>

2264
01:54:56.251 --> 01:54:58.630
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they led this boom.</v>

2265
01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:01.780
<v Speaker 4>He's a giant dude French too.</v>

2266
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>

2267
01:55:02.731 --> 01:55:06.420
<v Speaker 1>But I believe originally from Nigeria I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>

2268
01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:09.840
<v Speaker 1>And really look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>

2269
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:11.820
<v Speaker 1>big powerful guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying guy.</v>

2270
01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:14.270
<v Speaker 4>So here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of my pet theories,</v>

2271
01:55:14.290 --> 01:55:17.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why I let my kids have sugar by the way.</v>

2272
01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:20.880
<v Speaker 4>Ouch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The uh,</v>

2273
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:27.310
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things that happens when </v>

2274
01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:27.310
<v Speaker 4>you increase insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the sugar,</v>

2275
01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:30.831
<v Speaker 4>the sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because on some resistant that results </v>

2276
01:55:30.831 --> 01:55:32.100
<v Speaker 4>in chronic increases and insulin levels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So insulin stimulates fat accumulation,</v>

2277
01:55:32.101 --> 01:55:35.940
<v Speaker 4>but it also stimulates the secretion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>insulin,</v>

2278
01:55:35.941 --> 01:55:38.610
<v Speaker 4>like growth hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is similar to growth hormone.</v>

2279
01:55:38.611 --> 01:55:43.611
<v Speaker 4>So the reason we grow is not because </v>
<v Speaker 4>growth hormone drives tissues and </v>

2280
01:55:43.611 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 4>skeletal muscle grow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it drives</v>

2281
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:46.890
<v Speaker 3>into like growth factor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which then works on a local level.</v>

2282
01:55:48.630 --> 01:55:50.450
<v Speaker 3>So if you have more insulin in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

2283
01:55:50.451 --> 01:55:55.451
<v Speaker 3>you can have more insulin like growth </v>
<v Speaker 3>factor and it's going to be more </v>

2284
01:55:55.451 --> 01:55:55.451
<v Speaker 3>bioavailable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2285
01:55:55.451 --> 01:55:59.600
<v Speaker 3>there's these proteins binding proteins </v>
<v Speaker 3>that float around the bloodstream and </v>

2286
01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:03.621
<v Speaker 3>they'll bind to igf growth factor and </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it so can't get into cells or can't</v>

2287
01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:09.320
<v Speaker 3>bind to the receptors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you would expect as populations,</v>

2288
01:56:10.711 --> 01:56:13.590
<v Speaker 3>as populations have become more intense </v>
<v Speaker 3>in some resistance,</v>

2289
01:56:13.591 --> 01:56:18.090
<v Speaker 3>you would expect them to grow to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>taller as well as thicker and fatter and</v>

2290
01:56:18.091 --> 01:56:23.091
<v Speaker 3>more diabetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the classic observations as </v>

2291
01:56:23.091 --> 01:56:24.750
<v Speaker 3>populations become Westernized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get taller and this,</v>

2292
01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:29.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at medical records or army </v>

2293
01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:29.780
<v Speaker 3>records from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2294
01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:33.080
<v Speaker 3>the civil war and everybody weld them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're like five foot six and um,</v>

2295
01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:38.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now clearly the average height has gone </v>

2296
01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:38.730
<v Speaker 3>up and it's kind of leveled off a bit in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States.</v>

2297
01:56:38.730 --> 01:56:41.160
<v Speaker 3>But there's still countries in Europe or</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gotten higher.</v>

2298
01:56:41.161 --> 01:56:46.161
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that freaks me out</v>
<v Speaker 3>is when they go to Europe nowadays and </v>

2299
01:56:46.161 --> 01:56:49.160
<v Speaker 3>you're walking around a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>scandinavians and I feel petite Holland.</v>

2300
01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:54.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rich Man in Holland is over six foot </v>

2301
01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:54.380
<v Speaker 3>tall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was growing up I was definitively</v>

2302
01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:59.331
<v Speaker 3>tall and now I haven't shrunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it might be getting there </v>

2303
01:56:59.331 --> 01:57:00.510
<v Speaker 3>and now it's just like everyone seemed </v>
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

2304
01:57:00.511 --> 01:57:00.990
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

2305
01:57:00.991 --> 01:57:04.500
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the conventional thinking is they get</v>

2306
01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:09.680
<v Speaker 3>more calories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get more protein that you need the </v>

2307
01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:12.510
<v Speaker 3>protein for the growth and the calories </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's kind of the explanation,</v>

2308
01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:17.960
<v Speaker 3>but it could be that they get more sugar</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that drives vertical growth as well </v>

2309
01:57:18.091 --> 01:57:20.340
<v Speaker 3>as horizontal growth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And will that make sense?</v>

2310
01:57:20.341 --> 01:57:23.490
<v Speaker 3>Because don't bodybuilders like under </v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme situations,</v>

2311
01:57:23.491 --> 01:57:25.040
<v Speaker 3>don't they take insulin in order to.</v>

2312
01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:26.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2313
01:57:26.330 --> 01:57:29.100
<v Speaker 3>because it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll drive muscle development as well.</v>

2314
01:57:29.101 --> 01:57:29.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2315
01:57:29.461 --> 01:57:33.180
<v Speaker 3>it works as a growth hormone and igf is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a growth hormone.</v>

2316
01:57:33.181 --> 01:57:38.181
<v Speaker 3>So could there be an argument for </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilders to consume a diet that's </v>

2317
01:57:38.181 --> 01:57:41.500
<v Speaker 3>high in sugar in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to spike up that insulin to,</v>

2318
01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:46.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're getting out of my area of </v>

2319
01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:46.620
<v Speaker 3>expertise again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's funny,</v>

2320
01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:48.270
<v Speaker 3>when Arnold came over in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2321
01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:50.580
<v Speaker 3>one of the advantages he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other than,</v>

2322
01:57:50.610 --> 01:57:55.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive amounts of steroid consumption </v>

2323
01:57:55.610 --> 01:57:55.610
<v Speaker 3>was that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2324
01:57:55.680 --> 01:58:00.680
<v Speaker 3>I forget who his mentor was back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they put them on a very low carb </v>

2325
01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:01.500
<v Speaker 3>diet because that definitely cuts the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>

2326
01:58:01.501 --> 01:58:04.090
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is far out of my area of expertise,</v>

2327
01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:06.210
<v Speaker 3>but you get a bodybuilder and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you how they,</v>

2328
01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:07.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2329
01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:09.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2330
01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:13.710
<v Speaker 3>oscillate between the high carbs for </v>
<v Speaker 3>development,</v>

2331
01:58:13.711 --> 01:58:17.760
<v Speaker 3>high fat to cut the fat and get down to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this debate.</v>

2332
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Do you know Alan Aragon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2333
01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:20.130
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2334
01:58:20.131 --> 01:58:21.050
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know who that guy is.</v>

2335
01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:22.980
<v Speaker 3>So Allen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had a debate.</v>

2336
01:58:23.010 --> 01:58:24.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2337
01:58:24.061 --> 01:58:25.470
<v Speaker 3>he's very skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2338
01:58:25.690 --> 01:58:28.800
<v Speaker 3>it's a kind way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's a bit of A.</v>

2339
01:58:28.830 --> 01:58:30.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always wanted to ask him like,</v>

2340
01:58:30.661 --> 01:58:31.520
<v Speaker 3>Alan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you know,</v>

2341
01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:33.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this isn't.</v>

2342
01:58:34.100 --> 01:58:39.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm arguing that that defined his </v>
<v Speaker 3>position because he has no calories.</v>

2343
01:58:40.110 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 3>It's just all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you get people</v>

2344
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:44.920
<v Speaker 4>to exercise and off field turn an obese </v>
<v Speaker 4>person lean.</v>

2345
01:58:44.921 --> 01:58:45.760
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that,</v>

2346
01:58:45.970 --> 01:58:48.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the implication that it can happen,</v>

2347
01:58:48.250 --> 01:58:53.250
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck is going to do it the way </v>

2348
01:58:53.250 --> 01:58:55.711
<v Speaker 4>you would have to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would essentially have to starve </v>

2349
01:58:55.711 --> 01:58:55.711
<v Speaker 4>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2350
01:58:55.711 --> 01:58:57.610
<v Speaker 4>but this is the point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I could get it done that way.</v>

2351
01:58:57.640 --> 01:58:59.380
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't say any reason.</v>

2352
01:58:59.381 --> 01:59:01.480
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't say anything about why they </v>
<v Speaker 4>got fat to begin with.</v>

2353
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:06.510
<v Speaker 4>I didn't say anything about the damaging</v>
<v Speaker 4>effects of sugar and I could inhibit </v>

2354
01:59:06.510 --> 01:59:09.480
<v Speaker 4>your kid's growth by starving them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2355
01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:11.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they're going to be stunted.</v>

2356
01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:16.200
<v Speaker 4>But that doesn't mean they're growing </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they get to eat as much as they </v>

2357
01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:16.200
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're growing because their brains are</v>

2358
01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:18.700
<v Speaker 4>secreting growth hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stimulate igf.</v>

2359
01:59:18.701 --> 01:59:22.000
<v Speaker 4>And that makes them hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what is he denying about?</v>

2360
01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:23.250
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we rented</v>

2361
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:26.310
<v Speaker 3>Bait in England that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2362
01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:32.240
<v Speaker 3>it was about a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't quite understand what he was </v>

2363
01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:32.240
<v Speaker 3>denying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the interesting thing.</v>

2364
01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:36.981
<v Speaker 3>He basically was denying that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that obesity was a hormonal </v>

2365
01:59:37.291 --> 01:59:42.291
<v Speaker 3>metabolic disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a denied that a journalist knows </v>

2366
01:59:42.291 --> 01:59:45.441
<v Speaker 3>something that he doesn't and that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>advice he's been giving and that what </v>

2367
01:59:45.841 --> 01:59:49.010
<v Speaker 3>he's been voicing over the years is </v>
<v Speaker 3>right and what is,</v>

2368
01:59:49.011 --> 01:59:51.060
<v Speaker 3>does a medical background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2369
01:59:51.070 --> 01:59:53.360
<v Speaker 3>he's got no medical background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a physical trainer.</v>

2370
01:59:53.370 --> 01:59:57.270
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's an exercise physiologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's no more doctor and nutritionist and</v>

2371
01:59:57.271 --> 01:59:59.070
<v Speaker 3>I am the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2372
02:00:00.450 --> 02:00:04.080
<v Speaker 3>the point since I was looking for ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>to debate him.</v>

2373
02:00:04.081 --> 02:00:07.950
<v Speaker 3>So I found a clip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a need internet,</v>

2374
02:00:07.951 --> 02:00:12.951
<v Speaker 3>one of his lectures where he was talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how there was one particular </v>

2375
02:00:12.951 --> 02:00:13.210
<v Speaker 3>athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was training a bodybuilder.</v>

2376
02:00:13.230 --> 02:00:16.650
<v Speaker 3>He had to get maximum caught for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition.</v>

2377
02:00:16.651 --> 02:00:21.651
<v Speaker 3>So he cut his carbs down and if he cut </v>
<v Speaker 3>the carbs preferentially you do that </v>

2378
02:00:23.371 --> 02:00:28.371
<v Speaker 3>because you're going to reduce insulin </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to mobilize maximum </v>

2379
02:00:28.371 --> 02:00:31.011
<v Speaker 3>amount of fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get the most possible </v>

2380
02:00:31.011 --> 02:00:33.231
<v Speaker 3>fat out of the fat tissue by doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it clearly meant he believes what I </v>

2381
02:00:33.231 --> 02:00:34.200
<v Speaker 3>believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some people just,</v>

2382
02:00:34.380 --> 02:00:35.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to establish what,</v>

2383
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.280
<v Speaker 3>how did he respond to that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He laughed.</v>

2384
02:00:38.281 --> 02:00:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Everybody laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got kind of embarrassed,</v>

2385
02:00:40.141 --> 02:00:41.130
<v Speaker 3>but it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2386
02:00:41.370 --> 02:00:46.260
<v Speaker 3>it was an interesting debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a fitness expo in,</v>

2387
02:00:46.770 --> 02:00:48.020
<v Speaker 3>I forget what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2388
02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:50.940
<v Speaker 3>red brick town in England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2389
02:00:50.941 --> 02:00:51.770
<v Speaker 3>one of these.</v>

2390
02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:54.500
<v Speaker 4>The reason why I keep bringing him up is</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I've been.</v>

2391
02:00:55.340 --> 02:01:00.340
<v Speaker 4>I've been contacted by fans of his have </v>
<v Speaker 4>been in communication with him at one </v>

2392
02:01:01.101 --> 02:01:06.101
<v Speaker 4>point in time and I didn't realize how </v>
<v Speaker 4>strongly against this proposition he is </v>

2393
02:01:06.321 --> 02:01:06.890
<v Speaker 4>or this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2394
02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:10.430
<v Speaker 4>well you should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should get him to do the show.</v>

2395
02:01:10.431 --> 02:01:11.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's very chatty,</v>

2396
02:01:11.871 --> 02:01:16.871
<v Speaker 4>talkative guy and he'll explain it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and then you could argue and we </v>

2397
02:01:16.871 --> 02:01:16.871
<v Speaker 4>could argue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what it does,</v>

2398
02:01:16.871 --> 02:01:18.950
<v Speaker 4>what does he say about the impact of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar?</v>

2399
02:01:19.190 --> 02:01:24.190
<v Speaker 4>Like does he deny all these things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking to them about bds and we </v>

2400
02:01:24.190 --> 02:01:25.870
<v Speaker 4>did not say this debate.</v>

2401
02:01:26.410 --> 02:01:30.460
<v Speaker 3>I would hate to get Allan's position </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

2402
02:01:30.461 --> 02:01:34.930
<v Speaker 3>but if he's implying that obesity is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy balance problem,</v>

2403
02:01:34.931 --> 02:01:36.560
<v Speaker 3>it's calories in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>calories out.</v>

2404
02:01:36.561 --> 02:01:38.140
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seemed to be the argument.</v>

2405
02:01:38.141 --> 02:01:40.580
<v Speaker 3>He was defending vociferously when we </v>
<v Speaker 3>debated.</v>

2406
02:01:41.090 --> 02:01:46.090
<v Speaker 3>That in turn means that the only way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that foods can influence your body </v>

2407
02:01:46.090 --> 02:01:48.650
<v Speaker 3>weight is through their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a caloric content,</v>

2408
02:01:49.130 --> 02:01:52.970
<v Speaker 3>and that means sugar is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2409
02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.130
<v Speaker 3>an empty calorie than where she could </v>
<v Speaker 3>say about it.</v>

2410
02:01:55.450 --> 02:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Clearly not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If sugar actually does affect your </v>

2411
02:02:00.450 --> 02:02:02.470
<v Speaker 1>hormonal state and that affects the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body processes</v>

2412
02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:03.240
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so,</v>

2413
02:02:03.241 --> 02:02:06.570
<v Speaker 3>he went on insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he were to believe that,</v>

2414
02:02:06.571 --> 02:02:09.020
<v Speaker 3>then he would have been conceding that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>won the debates,</v>

2415
02:02:09.070 --> 02:02:13.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he clearly doesn't think I did.</v>

2416
02:02:13.051 --> 02:02:13.940
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2417
02:02:13.950 --> 02:02:18.950
<v Speaker 3>frankly I didn't because the crowd was </v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent with him when we started and</v>

2418
02:02:19.081 --> 02:02:21.390
<v Speaker 3>it was like 95 percent with them when we</v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

2419
02:02:22.230 --> 02:02:25.080
<v Speaker 3>But that's still pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I would argue.</v>

2420
02:02:25.081 --> 02:02:30.081
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I learned my lesson that you can't </v>

2421
02:02:30.081 --> 02:02:33.921
<v Speaker 3>win a debate when you're going in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone sides with your now why did </v>

2422
02:02:33.921 --> 02:02:36.400
<v Speaker 3>they all signed with him as they love </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar now?</v>

2423
02:02:36.450 --> 02:02:38.170
<v Speaker 3>What was under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't about sugars,</v>

2424
02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:43.180
<v Speaker 3>but the cause of obesity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were actually debating different </v>

2425
02:02:43.180 --> 02:02:43.180
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was kind of,</v>

2426
02:02:43.180 --> 02:02:47.660
<v Speaker 3>it was a weird situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I may have blocked it out of my </v>

2427
02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:47.660
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we were debating,</v>

2428
02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:48.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2429
02:02:48.151 --> 02:02:49.620
<v Speaker 3>my argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obesity,</v>

2430
02:02:49.710 --> 02:02:54.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm what I thought we were supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be debating was whether or not obesity </v>

2431
02:02:56.731 --> 02:03:01.731
<v Speaker 3>is caused by consuming too many calories</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the macronutrient contents </v>

2432
02:03:01.731 --> 02:03:05.481
<v Speaker 3>influencing this sort of hormonal </v>
<v Speaker 3>metabolic regulation of fat </v>

2433
02:03:05.481 --> 02:03:05.580
<v Speaker 3>accumulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2434
02:03:05.730 --> 02:03:10.730
<v Speaker 3>what we ended up debating was whether or</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the people in the audience would </v>

2435
02:03:10.730 --> 02:03:15.051
<v Speaker 3>rather be trained by Alan Aragon and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical trainer,</v>

2436
02:03:15.211 --> 02:03:20.211
<v Speaker 3>exercise physiologist or Gary Taubes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the journalist because that's kind of </v>

2437
02:03:20.211 --> 02:03:21.930
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is kind of ridiculous.</v>

2438
02:03:21.931 --> 02:03:25.260
<v Speaker 3>And it was a bizarre experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2439
02:03:25.270 --> 02:03:25.590
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2440
02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:27.810
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an interesting trip.</v>

2441
02:03:27.811 --> 02:03:28.800
<v Speaker 3>And you learn your lesson</v>

2442
02:03:29.250 --> 02:03:34.250
<v Speaker 1>conversations with people before and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the problem with those </v>

2443
02:03:34.250 --> 02:03:34.250
<v Speaker 1>conversations is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2444
02:03:34.250 --> 02:03:37.350
<v Speaker 1>you're taking a very simplistic approach</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a very complex scenario.</v>

2445
02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:42.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you did work out more and if you did </v>

2446
02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:45.381
<v Speaker 1>do all these different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to affect your body and </v>

2447
02:03:45.381 --> 02:03:47.871
<v Speaker 1>your hormone levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you start doing deep squats with </v>

2448
02:03:47.871 --> 02:03:48.300
<v Speaker 1>heavy weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start doing dead lifts and you start</v>

2449
02:03:49.170 --> 02:03:51.360
<v Speaker 1>putting a weight vest on that hiking up </v>
<v Speaker 1>hills,</v>

2450
02:03:51.361 --> 02:03:54.690
<v Speaker 1>you're going to massively affect the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body produces hormones.</v>

2451
02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Your body is going to ramp up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to deal with these new </v>

2452
02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:02.541
<v Speaker 1>domains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to change the way you partitioned </v>

2453
02:04:02.541 --> 02:04:02.541
<v Speaker 1>fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since things are gonna happen.</v>

2454
02:04:02.541 --> 02:04:07.340
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as simple as a lot of people </v>

2455
02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:07.740
<v Speaker 1>like to point it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people see they seem to want to</v>

2456
02:04:07.741 --> 02:04:10.290
<v Speaker 1>do it as a math problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2457
02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:11.940
<v Speaker 1>calories in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calories out.</v>

2458
02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

2459
02:04:12.190 --> 02:04:16.420
<v Speaker 3>just said that I gave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Altadena on Sunday talking at a</v>

2460
02:04:16.421 --> 02:04:19.750
<v Speaker 3>skeptic society meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll go to Altadena,</v>

2461
02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:21.220
<v Speaker 3>Michael Shermer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael,</v>

2462
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:27.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was during the torrential rain </v>

2463
02:04:27.310 --> 02:04:31.261
<v Speaker 3>storms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was touch and go getting there </v>

2464
02:04:31.261 --> 02:04:31.261
<v Speaker 3>because the roads were flooded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2465
02:04:31.570 --> 02:04:33.940
<v Speaker 3>just one guy sitting in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the front row,</v>

2466
02:04:33.941 --> 02:04:36.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a calorie restricted or you know,</v>

2467
02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.000
<v Speaker 3>one of these guys who eats like eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he lives on 1800 calories a day cause </v>

2468
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.340
<v Speaker 3>he's thinks he's going to live longer </v>
<v Speaker 3>and asked him if he wants to spar,</v>

2469
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:49.680
<v Speaker 3>I'll get tired and about 20 seconds.</v>

2470
02:04:52.490 --> 02:04:53.820
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2471
02:04:53.821 --> 02:04:56.300
<v Speaker 3>the other thing with those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot of muscle tone,</v>

2472
02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:58.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they don't have enough calories.</v>

2473
02:04:58.050 --> 02:05:00.420
<v Speaker 3>Dead Man walking so that anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to live forever.</v>

2474
02:05:00.430 --> 02:05:02.010
<v Speaker 3>And Skeleton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

2475
02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:07.230
<v Speaker 3>I did give a talk to the calorie </v>
<v Speaker 3>restriction society.</v>

2476
02:05:07.231 --> 02:05:12.231
<v Speaker 3>I'm digressing again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is in Novato north or San </v>

2477
02:05:12.231 --> 02:05:16.220
<v Speaker 3>Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I got one of the guys in the email </v>

2478
02:05:16.220 --> 02:05:17.871
<v Speaker 3>afterwards said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was explaining that I thought all </v>

2479
02:05:17.871 --> 02:05:20.481
<v Speaker 3>the benefits of calorie restriction come</v>
<v Speaker 3>from carbohydrate restriction because </v>

2480
02:05:20.481 --> 02:05:23.750
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of evidence suggesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>that wouldn't make sense if it is </v>

2481
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:25.320
<v Speaker 3>beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because these guys minimum minimize</v>

2482
02:05:25.321 --> 02:05:28.730
<v Speaker 3>insulin and igf secretion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2483
02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:32.460
<v Speaker 3>you can minimize insulin igf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just not eating the carbs.</v>

2484
02:05:32.461 --> 02:05:34.500
<v Speaker 3>And then you get the fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of your body,</v>

2485
02:05:34.501 --> 02:05:36.480
<v Speaker 3>so you get the calories you need to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>the protein,</v>

2486
02:05:36.481 --> 02:05:41.481
<v Speaker 3>you need to get the fat you need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't eat the thing that stimulates </v>

2487
02:05:41.481 --> 02:05:41.481
<v Speaker 3>insulin.</v>

2488
02:05:41.481 --> 02:05:44.810
<v Speaker 3>Igf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And after the lecture I got an email </v>

2489
02:05:44.810 --> 02:05:45.750
<v Speaker 3>from a guy in the audience who is part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this society who said,</v>

2490
02:05:45.751 --> 02:05:46.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to experiment.</v>

2491
02:05:46.981 --> 02:05:49.510
<v Speaker 3>I should get back with him to see what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

2492
02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:50.790
<v Speaker 3>It was like four years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2493
02:05:50.791 --> 02:05:52.680
<v Speaker 3>you look so much healthier than all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

2494
02:05:53.250 --> 02:05:58.250
<v Speaker 3>And your argument was compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to experiment to see if maybe </v>

2495
02:05:58.250 --> 02:06:01.620
<v Speaker 3>there's something to what you say and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to shift over from eating,</v>

2496
02:06:01.650 --> 02:06:06.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1800 calories of like 50 percent carbs </v>

2497
02:06:06.650 --> 02:06:10.790
<v Speaker 3>to 1800 or maybe 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>or who knows how many of protein and </v>

2498
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.790
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2499
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:11.090
<v Speaker 3>I had Dr</v>

2500
02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda Patrick on the other day and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was discussing some pretty compelling </v>

2501
02:06:16.200 --> 02:06:20.671
<v Speaker 1>evidence about the amount of time that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you eat during the day and intermittent </v>

2502
02:06:20.671 --> 02:06:24.241
<v Speaker 1>fasting and the importance of only </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating within a 10 hour period from the </v>

2503
02:06:24.241 --> 02:06:28.831
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wake up to the time you stopped </v>

2504
02:06:28.831 --> 02:06:29.050
<v Speaker 1>eating no more than 10 hours and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your day,</v>

2505
02:06:29.051 --> 02:06:31.750
<v Speaker 1>the remaining 14 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no food.</v>

2506
02:06:31.990 --> 02:06:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's interesting because even,</v>

2507
02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:38.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was talking about the massive </v>

2508
02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:40.741
<v Speaker 1>benefits of that and in terms of gaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lean muscle mass just from doing </v>

2509
02:06:40.741 --> 02:06:43.120
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>losing body fat just from doing that.</v>

2510
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:44.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2511
02:06:44.241 --> 02:06:46.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm skeptical of everything.</v>

2512
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:49.430
<v Speaker 3>I try to be as skeptical of my ideas as </v>
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>

2513
02:06:49.431 --> 02:06:52.400
<v Speaker 3>Although people say I fail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

2514
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:56.900
<v Speaker 3>I haven't read those studies closely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get them to you after we get out of</v>

2515
02:06:57.340 --> 02:07:00.200
<v Speaker 1>send it to you and send you the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual podcast itself.</v>

2516
02:07:00.201 --> 02:07:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll find it pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

2517
02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:03.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2518
02:07:03.481 --> 02:07:05.110
<v Speaker 3>the issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't doubt it works.</v>

2519
02:07:05.130 --> 02:07:07.850
<v Speaker 3>I know people who had trouble losing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2520
02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:12.880
<v Speaker 3>significant weight on low carb diets and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then switched intermittent fasting and </v>

2521
02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:13.810
<v Speaker 3>broke through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2522
02:07:14.690 --> 02:07:15.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2523
02:07:16.110 --> 02:07:19.070
<v Speaker 3>there are some people I know in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>field who I like,</v>

2524
02:07:19.071 --> 02:07:24.071
<v Speaker 3>who think that you might get excessive </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress hormone stimulation from the fast</v>

2525
02:07:24.141 --> 02:07:29.141
<v Speaker 3>thing so that the long term effects may </v>
<v Speaker 3>not be as beneficial as a kid agentic </v>

2526
02:07:29.151 --> 02:07:34.151
<v Speaker 3>diet where you're not a zero evidence of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that cortisol.</v>

2527
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be,</v>

2528
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:36.880
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my understanding,</v>

2529
02:07:36.881 --> 02:07:41.881
<v Speaker 4>I haven't paid a lot of attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but based on people with a carbohydrate </v>

2530
02:07:41.881 --> 02:07:44.260
<v Speaker 4>rich diet or people fat rich diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's Google.</v>

2531
02:07:44.261 --> 02:07:49.261
<v Speaker 4>I'm Steve Finney,</v>
<v Speaker 4>P H I n n e y and fasting.</v>

2532
02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:53.080
<v Speaker 4>I love this by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I don't need a memory.</v>

2533
02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:54.730
<v Speaker 4>All those concussions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2534
02:07:54.731 --> 02:07:56.860
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter anymore how many </v>
<v Speaker 4>concussions you have,</v>

2535
02:07:56.861 --> 02:07:58.570
<v Speaker 4>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think between football.</v>

2536
02:07:58.571 --> 02:08:03.571
<v Speaker 4>And so you say between football.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started thinking between football and </v>

2537
02:08:03.571 --> 02:08:05.800
<v Speaker 4>boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd say five or six.</v>

2538
02:08:05.820 --> 02:08:06.390
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2539
02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:09.250
<v Speaker 4>you got off light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did get off flight.</v>

2540
02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:11.920
<v Speaker 4>Steven Dot Finney on making a low carb </v>
<v Speaker 4>diet.</v>

2541
02:08:11.921 --> 02:08:14.800
<v Speaker 4>Sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want to do Steve Finney,</v>

2542
02:08:14.801 --> 02:08:18.100
<v Speaker 4>a intermittent try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Intermittent fast thing.</v>

2543
02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:22.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm uh,</v>

2544
02:08:22.810 --> 02:08:26.570
<v Speaker 4>let's see if we pull up low car </v>
<v Speaker 4>preserves.</v>

2545
02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:27.710
<v Speaker 4>Well that's obvious.</v>

2546
02:08:27.850 --> 02:08:29.880
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2547
02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:34.880
<v Speaker 4>cutting edge fat burning podcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2548
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:35.750
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're done.</v>

2549
02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.010
<v Speaker 4>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

2550
02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:38.710
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

2551
02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:42.650
<v Speaker 4>Between the world's most cutting edge </v>
<v Speaker 4>fat burning performance media plan,</v>

2552
02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:43.800
<v Speaker 4>the Keto Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2553
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:45.740
<v Speaker 4>Well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll get into that.</v>

2554
02:08:45.770 --> 02:08:50.770
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have much time left because </v>

2555
02:08:50.770 --> 02:08:50.770
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have to bail soon to </v>
<v Speaker 4>catch a flight.</v>

2556
02:08:50.770 --> 02:08:54.170
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't wanna I don't wanna make you </v>

2557
02:08:54.170 --> 02:08:54.170
<v Speaker 4>miss your flight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is um,</v>

2558
02:08:54.170 --> 02:08:58.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>another thing that people can look into </v>

2559
02:08:58.090 --> 02:08:58.240
<v Speaker 4>once they're done with the intro thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even the intermittent fast.</v>

2560
02:08:58.241 --> 02:09:01.490
<v Speaker 4>And the interesting thing is there's two</v>
<v Speaker 4>ways to think of it.</v>

2561
02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:02.440
<v Speaker 4>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2562
02:09:02.441 --> 02:09:03.250
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your reading life,</v>

2563
02:09:03.251 --> 02:09:05.300
<v Speaker 4>fewer calories and that's how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2564
02:09:05.301 --> 02:09:10.301
<v Speaker 4>And the other is you're maximizing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of time during the day when </v>

2565
02:09:10.301 --> 02:09:13.631
<v Speaker 4>insulin and igf are low and when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying eating fewer cowers because </v>

2566
02:09:13.761 --> 02:09:16.010
<v Speaker 4>that's not necessarily what they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking I'm talking about,</v>

2567
02:09:16.011 --> 02:09:19.640
<v Speaker 4>is taking time and allowing your body to</v>
<v Speaker 4>process all those nutrients.</v>

2568
02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:24.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And not using the resources that could </v>

2569
02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:25.190
<v Speaker 4>be developing muscle and in building </v>
<v Speaker 4>your body up.</v>

2570
02:09:25.191 --> 02:09:30.191
<v Speaker 4>So that would account for the increase </v>
<v Speaker 4>in lean muscle mass simply by following </v>

2571
02:09:30.191 --> 02:09:32.270
<v Speaker 4>this intermittent fasting program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although it's interesting,</v>

2572
02:09:32.271 --> 02:09:35.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you had this experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you went on the Ketogenic Diet.</v>

2573
02:09:35.931 --> 02:09:37.910
<v Speaker 4>So what I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you often read,</v>

2574
02:09:37.911 --> 02:09:38.780
<v Speaker 4>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you lose.</v>

2575
02:09:38.781 --> 02:09:43.781
<v Speaker 4>I was looking at a study today that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>done in one week study done like 1967 </v>

2576
02:09:43.781 --> 02:09:48.731
<v Speaker 4>where they lost more protein on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ketogenetic diet that a calorie </v>

2577
02:09:48.981 --> 02:09:51.200
<v Speaker 4>restricted diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were all calorie restricted.</v>

2578
02:09:51.980 --> 02:09:53.570
<v Speaker 4>But when I went on this diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was interesting.</v>

2579
02:09:53.571 --> 02:09:58.571
<v Speaker 4>My waist size went down and my jacket </v>
<v Speaker 4>size went up and I probably my upper </v>

2580
02:10:00.411 --> 02:10:05.411
<v Speaker 4>body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my lower body doesn't work because of </v>

2581
02:10:05.411 --> 02:10:08.410
<v Speaker 4>the cartilage in the knees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the other wonderful things football </v>

2582
02:10:08.410 --> 02:10:08.630
<v Speaker 4>left me with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

2583
02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:10.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2584
02:10:10.131 --> 02:10:12.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm stronger now than I was when I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>in college.</v>

2585
02:10:12.111 --> 02:10:14.510
<v Speaker 4>I was working out three hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell how old are you now?</v>

2586
02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:15.850
<v Speaker 4>Sixty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look.</v>

2587
02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:17.090
<v Speaker 4>Great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank you.</v>

2588
02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:18.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look good.</v>

2589
02:10:18.980 --> 02:10:21.980
<v Speaker 4>Too Cute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2590
02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:22.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

2591
02:10:22.731 --> 02:10:27.731
<v Speaker 4>so what's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The point is by changing the time at </v>

2592
02:10:28.041 --> 02:10:33.041
<v Speaker 4>which you reading,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I believe you could probably eat </v>

2593
02:10:33.041 --> 02:10:33.041
<v Speaker 4>this many calories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe need more calories by doing it.</v>

2594
02:10:33.041 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 4>It's not calorie thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's</v>

2595
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:38.980
<v Speaker 3>a how does your body respond to having </v>
<v Speaker 3>more time is low insulin levels </v>

2596
02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:44.380
<v Speaker 3>basically and low more time at low igf </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels and I could imagine even in the </v>

2597
02:10:45.051 --> 02:10:49.100
<v Speaker 3>low carb diets when people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>prescribing them 50 years ago,</v>

2598
02:10:49.101 --> 02:10:54.101
<v Speaker 3>60 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to prescribe a walk before </v>

2599
02:10:54.101 --> 02:10:56.771
<v Speaker 3>breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is interesting because that's the </v>

2600
02:10:56.771 --> 02:10:56.771
<v Speaker 3>time when your insulin levels are </v>
<v Speaker 3>lowest.</v>

2601
02:10:56.771 --> 02:11:00.080
<v Speaker 3>That's a time when you really mobilizing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fat from your fat tissue.</v>

2602
02:11:00.370 --> 02:11:01.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in that sense,</v>

2603
02:11:01.971 --> 02:11:06.971
<v Speaker 3>skipping breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prolonging the amount of time before </v>

2604
02:11:06.971 --> 02:11:09.941
<v Speaker 3>your first meal in the day would </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually maximize his time when you're </v>

2605
02:11:09.941 --> 02:11:13.841
<v Speaker 3>mobilizing fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have people prefer fasting </v>

2606
02:11:13.841 --> 02:11:13.841
<v Speaker 3>cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2607
02:11:13.841 --> 02:11:17.980
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they enjoy that wake up in the morning </v>

2608
02:11:17.980 --> 02:11:18.530
<v Speaker 3>and having hard cardio or some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard workout first thing in the morning.</v>

2609
02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:23.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's interesting because that's the </v>

2610
02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:25.120
<v Speaker 3>point of the day when they're most </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely to be burning fat rather than </v>

2611
02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:25.120
<v Speaker 3>glucose.</v>

2612
02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:27.050
<v Speaker 3>If they're not drinking a juice or soda </v>
<v Speaker 3>beforehand,</v>

2613
02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:30.920
<v Speaker 3>I could never do and I always wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to do cardio first.</v>

2614
02:11:30.921 --> 02:11:33.410
<v Speaker 3>We certainly could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just don't want to know.</v>

2615
02:11:33.411 --> 02:11:35.780
<v Speaker 3>I ended up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just elevated the whole day.</v>

2616
02:11:35.781 --> 02:11:39.980
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm dragging my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although I cannot wake up afterwards.</v>

2617
02:11:39.981 --> 02:11:43.130
<v Speaker 3>It's just my reality doesn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's even if I got you.</v>

2618
02:11:43.170 --> 02:11:45.320
<v Speaker 3>I got two kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a two boys,</v>

2619
02:11:45.321 --> 02:11:49.640
<v Speaker 3>11 and eight and I feed him breakfast in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the morning and I.</v>

2620
02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:52.730
<v Speaker 3>I Cook Him Dinner Maybe three times a </v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

2621
02:11:52.731 --> 02:11:57.731
<v Speaker 3>My wife's a vegetarian so I got to cook </v>
<v Speaker 3>the meat if I want them to eat animals </v>

2622
02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:01.460
<v Speaker 3>they have their body clocks are entirely</v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

2623
02:12:01.461 --> 02:12:06.020
<v Speaker 3>They have very different body types.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My youngest is not hungry in the morning</v>

2624
02:12:06.890 --> 02:12:09.620
<v Speaker 3>and my oldest is and my youngest at </v>
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

2625
02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:13.010
<v Speaker 3>like if you put pasta in front of him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would just keep eating it and needing</v>

2626
02:12:13.011 --> 02:12:14.630
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>needing it until you finally just say no</v>

2627
02:12:14.631 --> 02:12:15.740
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to blow up.</v>

2628
02:12:17.450 --> 02:12:21.110
<v Speaker 3>My eldest in the evening doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not interested in,</v>

2629
02:12:21.290 --> 02:12:22.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll eat a little bit.</v>

2630
02:12:22.670 --> 02:12:26.510
<v Speaker 3>He could skip dinner even like entirely </v>
<v Speaker 3>different body types,</v>

2631
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:31.750
<v Speaker 3>but timing of their hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has got to be related to insulin </v>

2632
02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:32.330
<v Speaker 3>secretion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other hormones,</v>

2633
02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:34.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bio rhythms,</v>

2634
02:12:34.610 --> 02:12:38.660
<v Speaker 3>so it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's different than that.</v>

2635
02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:42.950
<v Speaker 3>Biodiversity is a very important </v>
<v Speaker 3>consideration when you talking about any</v>

2636
02:12:42.951 --> 02:12:44.660
<v Speaker 3>kind of diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a Vegan diet,</v>

2637
02:12:44.661 --> 02:12:46.640
<v Speaker 3>a vegetarian diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ketogenic diet,</v>

2638
02:12:46.940 --> 02:12:49.490
<v Speaker 3>everybody's body responds differently to</v>
<v Speaker 3>different things,</v>

2639
02:12:49.550 --> 02:12:54.550
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying about getting back </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the case against sugar is we've got </v>

2640
02:12:54.550 --> 02:12:57.920
<v Speaker 3>obese and diabetic because of the sugar </v>
<v Speaker 3>and processed grains.</v>

2641
02:12:58.820 --> 02:13:03.820
<v Speaker 3>The people who became obese and diabetic</v>
<v Speaker 3>did so because of the sugar and the </v>

2642
02:13:04.581 --> 02:13:09.581
<v Speaker 3>process grades and that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their bodies all responded the same </v>

2643
02:13:09.581 --> 02:13:13.370
<v Speaker 3>regardless of what their geno type was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2644
02:13:13.670 --> 02:13:17.180
<v Speaker 3>And now when you want to get them back </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the edge,</v>

2645
02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:20.360
<v Speaker 3>that's where individual variation plays </v>
<v Speaker 3>a role.</v>

2646
02:13:20.361 --> 02:13:23.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean that guy mcdougall pushes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>starch diet.</v>

2647
02:13:23.211 --> 02:13:28.211
<v Speaker 3>He's got people on his website who swear</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they lost a hundred pounds eating </v>

2648
02:13:28.211 --> 02:13:31.661
<v Speaker 3>only potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think though that a lot of </v>

2649
02:13:31.661 --> 02:13:32.160
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you start concentrating</v>

2650
02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:37.280
<v Speaker 1>on losing weight and concentrating on </v>
<v Speaker 1>being healthy and concentrating on your </v>

2651
02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:40.881
<v Speaker 1>di,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make a concerted effort sort of </v>

2652
02:13:40.881 --> 02:13:40.881
<v Speaker 1>across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you just go,</v>

2653
02:13:40.881 --> 02:13:41.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm only gonna eat sweet potatoes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2654
02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:46.440
<v Speaker 1>and like it just the very act of </v>
<v Speaker 1>considering your diet and being </v>

2655
02:13:47.461 --> 02:13:49.410
<v Speaker 1>conscientious has an effect.</v>

2656
02:13:49.590 --> 02:13:51.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has an effect in many ways.</v>

2657
02:13:51.301 --> 02:13:56.301
<v Speaker 3>One of them is you do consistent things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are consistent things that </v>

2658
02:13:56.301 --> 02:13:58.080
<v Speaker 3>you don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like make the logo,</v>

2659
02:13:58.081 --> 02:14:03.081
<v Speaker 3>puts people on a starch diet and Atkins </v>
<v Speaker 3>puts them on a ketogenic diet and ornish</v>

2660
02:14:03.271 --> 02:14:08.271
<v Speaker 3>puts them on a 10 percent fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly vegetarian diet and nestled thien</v>

2661
02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:09.360
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2662
02:14:09.361 --> 02:14:12.030
<v Speaker 3>a low carb diet and none of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them say,</v>

2663
02:14:12.031 --> 02:14:14.340
<v Speaker 3>don't eat sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't drink soda.</v>

2664
02:14:14.341 --> 02:14:15.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't drink fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Juices,</v>

2665
02:14:15.780 --> 02:14:18.540
<v Speaker 3>don't eat white bread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they don't do it for the same reason</v>

2666
02:14:18.541 --> 02:14:21.060
<v Speaker 3>because it's good to stimulate insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2667
02:14:21.061 --> 02:14:22.680
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when they benefit,</v>

2668
02:14:23.790 --> 02:14:28.790
<v Speaker 3>you don't know if they benefited because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't eat meat or they didn't eat </v>

2669
02:14:28.830 --> 02:14:33.030
<v Speaker 3>gluten or they didn't eat sugar and </v>
<v Speaker 3>white bread and you know,</v>

2670
02:14:33.390 --> 02:14:38.390
<v Speaker 3>so the question then will become an even</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the ones who benefited like under </v>

2671
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:42.921
<v Speaker 3>McDougall diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that makes me suspicious is </v>

2672
02:14:42.921 --> 02:14:46.491
<v Speaker 3>the people we say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried Atkins and it didn't work for </v>

2673
02:14:46.491 --> 02:14:47.250
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is that that they really try it.</v>

2674
02:14:47.690 --> 02:14:52.690
<v Speaker 3>They try it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost 60 pounds and then went back to </v>

2675
02:14:52.690 --> 02:14:54.120
<v Speaker 3>eating carbs and gained it back and said</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Diet failed.</v>

2676
02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:58.350
<v Speaker 3>Did they just find it too hard to live </v>
<v Speaker 3>without their pastries?</v>

2677
02:14:58.380 --> 02:15:03.380
<v Speaker 3>But once they make duke came along and </v>
<v Speaker 3>put them on the potato diet or did he </v>

2678
02:15:03.380 --> 02:15:08.211
<v Speaker 3>just tell him to say that because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to point out that this works for </v>

2679
02:15:08.211 --> 02:15:09.570
<v Speaker 3>people that low carb does it and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just never know.</v>

2680
02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:13.200
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy world.</v>

2681
02:15:13.770 --> 02:15:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to tell when you're </v>

2682
02:15:18.770 --> 02:15:18.770
<v Speaker 1>dealing with anecdotal evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2683
02:15:18.770 --> 02:15:21.831
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard to tell when dealing with </v>

2684
02:15:21.831 --> 02:15:23.721
<v Speaker 1>personal experiences about what someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>says they did versus what they actually </v>

2685
02:15:23.721 --> 02:15:23.721
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

2686
02:15:23.721 --> 02:15:24.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one that's nobody knows.</v>

2687
02:15:24.341 --> 02:15:26.860
<v Speaker 3>And one of the great flow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's tons of.</v>

2688
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:31.870
<v Speaker 3>We could talk about the flaws in </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrition research for another three </v>

2689
02:15:31.870 --> 02:15:32.770
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'll be our next podcast.</v>

2690
02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:37.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting because I'm doing this </v>

2691
02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:37.790
<v Speaker 3>talk with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never done it like two,</v>

2692
02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:41.251
<v Speaker 3>three hour podcasts before and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like still laser focused and I could </v>

2693
02:15:41.251 --> 02:15:45.271
<v Speaker 3>imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm going to get in the ring </v>

2694
02:15:45.271 --> 02:15:45.271
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see it happening.</v>

2695
02:15:45.271 --> 02:15:46.450
<v Speaker 3>That exact thing that we discussed </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier about that,</v>

2696
02:15:46.451 --> 02:15:51.451
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need like five minutes of energy to </v>

2697
02:15:51.451 --> 02:15:52.840
<v Speaker 3>overwhelm your opponent and I could see </v>
<v Speaker 3>it happening here and I'm thinking,</v>

2698
02:15:52.841 --> 02:15:57.841
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't have a cold and I can </v>

2699
02:15:57.841 --> 02:15:57.841
<v Speaker 3>breathe through my nose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could take Joe,</v>

2700
02:15:57.841 --> 02:16:00.781
<v Speaker 3>we could go for seven hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can wear them out and if it gets bad </v>

2701
02:16:00.781 --> 02:16:01.780
<v Speaker 3>we'll take out the drugs and the Tequila</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'll see.</v>

2702
02:16:01.781 --> 02:16:04.250
<v Speaker 3>You know how there he's probably got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2703
02:16:04.251 --> 02:16:05.920
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get back in shape there.</v>

2704
02:16:06.010 --> 02:16:07.120
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

2705
02:16:07.150 --> 02:16:10.450
<v Speaker 3>So packet drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been a long time.</v>

2706
02:16:11.170 --> 02:16:13.670
<v Speaker 3>Well I got a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2707
02:16:13.671 --> 02:16:17.650
<v Speaker 3>establishment veneer that I got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>present to the world.</v>

2708
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:20.710
<v Speaker 3>Understand responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to get people who wear jackets and</v>

2709
02:16:20.711 --> 02:16:24.610
<v Speaker 3>ties and button down shirts from Brooks </v>
<v Speaker 3>brothers to take me seriously.</v>

2710
02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as weird as it sounds,</v>

2711
02:16:26.471 --> 02:16:28.120
<v Speaker 3>a lot of those fuckers are listening </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

2712
02:16:28.220 --> 02:16:30.160
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And done it for awhile.</v>

2713
02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:32.620
<v Speaker 1>This is a really important subject and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

2714
02:16:32.621 --> 02:16:37.621
<v Speaker 1>wrap this up here because I just want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much for writing that </v>

2715
02:16:37.621 --> 02:16:40.330
<v Speaker 1>book and taking the time to put it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that research,</v>

2716
02:16:40.331 --> 02:16:45.331
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against probably a lot of people's </v>

2717
02:16:45.331 --> 02:16:45.400
<v Speaker 1>advice and my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well her,</v>

2718
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:48.890

<v Speaker 1>in laws overall.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've made a substantial impact and </v>

2720
02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:56.671
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least a half a dozen people that I </v>

2721
02:16:56.671 --> 02:16:58.891
<v Speaker 1>deeply respected recommended your work </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm really glad I got a chance to </v>

2722
02:16:58.891 --> 02:17:02.101
<v Speaker 1>sit down and talk about this and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are going to benefit </v>

2723
02:17:02.101 --> 02:17:05.341
<v Speaker 1>from this podcast and this is one thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just sort of piling on top of a </v>

2724
02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:10.520
<v Speaker 1>massive amount of data that's now </v>
<v Speaker 1>available to people that lets them make </v>

2725
02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:10.520
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better food choice.</v>

2726
02:17:10.630 --> 02:17:15.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the one thing I was going to say </v>

2727
02:17:15.630 --> 02:17:17.371
<v Speaker 3>is what's really been the trump trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>card?</v>

2728
02:17:20.430 --> 02:17:22.890
<v Speaker 3>He's out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's really pushed,</v>

2729
02:17:22.891 --> 02:17:23.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2730
02:17:23.331 --> 02:17:26.140
<v Speaker 3>what's allows us to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2731
02:17:26.141 --> 02:17:30.910
<v Speaker 3>Which we couldn't win 50 years ago is he</v>
<v Speaker 3>internet and that,</v>

2732
02:17:30.911 --> 02:17:32.680
<v Speaker 3>and people can try these dive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember I said,</v>

2733
02:17:32.681 --> 02:17:34.010
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're dealt for aces.</v>

2734
02:17:34.030 --> 02:17:36.340
<v Speaker 3>The fact as you go on these diets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it helps people.</v>

2735
02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:38.020
<v Speaker 3>It helps them a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not everyone.</v>

2736
02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:40.570
<v Speaker 3>And we got distracted in some people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2737
02:17:40.571 --> 02:17:43.750
<v Speaker 3>maybe some people just have bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>reactions to cutting out all the carbs,</v>

2738
02:17:44.170 --> 02:17:46.600
<v Speaker 3>but for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some significant proportion,</v>

2739
02:17:46.601 --> 02:17:49.390
<v Speaker 3>they give up the carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're healthier and then they can talk</v>

2740
02:17:49.391 --> 02:17:51.760
<v Speaker 3>about on the Internet and they could </v>
<v Speaker 3>share with people and they don't have to</v>

2741
02:17:51.761 --> 02:17:54.730
<v Speaker 3>live in the same town or go to the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

2742
02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:58.750
<v Speaker 3>So the word gets out and then other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people want to be helped.</v>

2743
02:17:58.750 --> 02:17:59.230
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2744
02:17:59.231 --> 02:18:04.231
<v Speaker 3>even with physicians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like I got these doctors saying </v>

2745
02:18:04.231 --> 02:18:07.970
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you made medicine fund for me again </v>

2746
02:18:07.970 --> 02:18:09.130
<v Speaker 3>because I can help people and that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get spread around the Internet and they,</v>

2747
02:18:09.250 --> 02:18:14.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you create clusters and facebook groups </v>

2748
02:18:14.250 --> 02:18:15.310
<v Speaker 3>and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you create momentum and you break out of</v>

2749
02:18:15.311 --> 02:18:17.150
<v Speaker 3>the gatekeepers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no longer,</v>

2750
02:18:17.730 --> 02:18:21.940
<v Speaker 3>it's no longer just did I or did I not </v>
<v Speaker 3>get into the medical journal?</v>

2751
02:18:21.941 --> 02:18:23.950
<v Speaker 3>Was I influence enough to write this </v>
<v Speaker 3>review.</v>

2752
02:18:23.951 --> 02:18:25.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

2753
02:18:25.391 --> 02:18:30.391
<v Speaker 3>you said this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look at what happened to my </v>

2754
02:18:30.391 --> 02:18:30.880
<v Speaker 3>neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want that to happen to me.</v>

2755
02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:36.480
<v Speaker 3>And so you get this kind of revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's slow and it's takes time.</v>

2756
02:18:36.941 --> 02:18:37.660
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2757
02:18:37.661 --> 02:18:41.080
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of resistance and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetarian community,</v>

2758
02:18:41.081 --> 02:18:46.081
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they resist it because the implication </v>

2759
02:18:46.081 --> 02:18:46.320
<v Speaker 3>is that a lot of people will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthier for the Ada.</v>

2760
02:18:46.330 --> 02:18:48.290
<v Speaker 3>Animals said to Michael Pollan's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2761
02:18:48.291 --> 02:18:51.400
<v Speaker 3>eat food not too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly plants and for the,</v>

2762
02:18:51.970 --> 02:18:56.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obese diabetic individuals in the </v>

2763
02:18:56.970 --> 02:18:58.000
<v Speaker 3>country which represent virtually 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of Americans,</v>

2764
02:18:58.540 --> 02:18:59.650
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly animals.</v>

2765
02:19:00.050 --> 02:19:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping though that with the,</v>

2766
02:19:01.831 --> 02:19:02.180
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2767
02:19:02.181 --> 02:19:04.880
<v Speaker 1>there's been some really significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakthroughs over the last few years.</v>

2768
02:19:04.881 --> 02:19:08.690
<v Speaker 1>We had factory produced meat that does </v>
<v Speaker 1>not involve any animals dying,</v>

2769
02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:14.140
<v Speaker 1>their initial meet from a dead animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and reproduce it in factories and I </v>

2770
02:19:14.271 --> 02:19:19.271
<v Speaker 1>think we're probably just a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years away from mass production or </v>

2771
02:19:19.271 --> 02:19:19.271
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2772
02:19:19.271 --> 02:19:20.140
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that were in Missouri,</v>

2773
02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:21.710
<v Speaker 1>they're going to make low fat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2774
02:19:21.730 --> 02:19:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe with,</v>

2775
02:19:23.810 --> 02:19:28.810
<v Speaker 1>with what's going on right now and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding that people have versus </v>

2776
02:19:28.810 --> 02:19:28.810
<v Speaker 1>what they</v>

2777
02:19:28.810 --> 02:19:30.320
<v Speaker 4>had only five or six years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2778
02:19:30.370 --> 02:19:35.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's probably going to be a </v>

2779
02:19:35.370 --> 02:19:35.370
<v Speaker 4>market for high fat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope so.</v>

2780
02:19:35.370 --> 02:19:38.801
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna wait for you to try it and </v>

2781
02:19:38.801 --> 02:19:40.880
<v Speaker 4>telling that shows the benefit of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>a hunter.</v>

2782
02:19:40.970 --> 02:19:44.390
<v Speaker 4>So a kill my own meat is healthy as it </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets.</v>

2783
02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:45.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

2784
02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:47.020
<v Speaker 4>I sympathize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2785
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:49.520
<v Speaker 4>I completely understand where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetarians and the vegans can.</v>

2786
02:19:49.521 --> 02:19:50.340
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2787
02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:53.410
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I admire them as.</v>

2788
02:19:53.420 --> 02:19:57.050
<v Speaker 4>I really feel like anybody could eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like naturally sourced eggs.</v>

2789
02:19:57.260 --> 02:20:00.800
<v Speaker 4>Like I have chickens and they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't get harmed by me eating their</v>

2790
02:20:00.801 --> 02:20:05.801
<v Speaker 4>eggs at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They live a natural life and </v>

2791
02:20:05.801 --> 02:20:08.231
<v Speaker 4>everything's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no cruelty involved </v>

2792
02:20:08.231 --> 02:20:08.231
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those eggs are extremely healthy and</v>

2793
02:20:08.231 --> 02:20:09.910
<v Speaker 4>beneficial and that's some of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2794
02:20:10.100 --> 02:20:13.490
<v Speaker 4>emails I ever got were from Vegetarians </v>
<v Speaker 4>who said,</v>

2795
02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:14.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read your stuff.</v>

2796
02:20:14.690 --> 02:20:17.030
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought I'm intellectually open.</v>

2797
02:20:17.031 --> 02:20:20.150
<v Speaker 4>I'll read a couple of chapters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>decide it's full of shit,</v>

2798
02:20:20.151 --> 02:20:22.730
<v Speaker 4>and then I'll be able to close it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And much to my dismay,</v>

2799
02:20:22.731 --> 02:20:26.000
<v Speaker 4>I found your argument compelling and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them start eating,</v>

2800
02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:29.000
<v Speaker 4>start eating meat again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some just add eggs back to their diet,</v>

2801
02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:34.160
<v Speaker 4>thanks to the shoulder and the crap and </v>
<v Speaker 4>find that they're healthier and happier </v>

2802
02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:35.430
<v Speaker 4>and they feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>

2803
02:20:35.450 --> 02:20:38.510
<v Speaker 4>that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you don't convince,</v>

2804
02:20:38.511 --> 02:20:40.190
<v Speaker 4>when you see somebody say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2805
02:20:40.191 --> 02:20:40.730
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2806
02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:43.160
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do see your point.</v>

2807
02:20:43.161 --> 02:20:44.570
<v Speaker 4>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can change.</v>

2808
02:20:44.640 --> 02:20:49.640
<v Speaker 4>I feel like for people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eggs are the best compromise because </v>

2809
02:20:49.640 --> 02:20:50.180
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can easily digest them.</v>

2810
02:20:50.290 --> 02:20:53.180
<v Speaker 4>It's very few issues whatsoever with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2811
02:20:53.181 --> 02:20:54.560
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a yard,</v>

2812
02:20:54.740 --> 02:20:59.740
<v Speaker 4>you could have your own chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's not only that you can make </v>

2813
02:20:59.740 --> 02:20:59.740
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's they're like quick,</v>

2814
02:20:59.740 --> 02:21:04.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could scramble for eggs in the </v>

2815
02:21:04.090 --> 02:21:04.090
<v Speaker 4>morning and almost as much time as it </v>
<v Speaker 4>takes to poor salary.</v>

2816
02:21:04.090 --> 02:21:05.370
<v Speaker 4>I went to a ball cap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

2817
02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:06.900
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2818
02:21:07.010 --> 02:21:09.460
<v Speaker 4>So it sounds like I don't have time to </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat right.</v>

2819
02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:14.770
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't take a lot of work to be </v>

2820
02:21:14.770 --> 02:21:14.770
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people,</v>

2821
02:21:14.770 --> 02:21:14.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my oldest son,</v>

2822
02:21:14.770 --> 02:21:18.461
<v Speaker 4>I can't get them to eat an egg unless </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gotten motsa mixed in and maple </v>

2823
02:21:18.461 --> 02:21:20.060
<v Speaker 4>syrup port.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is.</v>

2824
02:21:20.061 --> 02:21:21.320
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of these things,</v>

2825
02:21:21.321 --> 02:21:23.210
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's poison to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But listen,</v>

2826
02:21:23.211 --> 02:21:24.990
<v Speaker 4>Gary,</v>
