<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

88
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.690
<v Speaker 1>So for some reason I got in the car and there was so much traffic.</v>

89
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.200
<v Speaker 1>I went from Laurel Canyon Rafford the van eyes,</v>

90
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.300
<v Speaker 1>cause I couldn't make a right turn,</v>

91
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.131
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

92
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand me guys as dirty years smoked the weed,</v>

93
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.070
<v Speaker 1>heroin every day.</v>

94
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't make a right turn.</v>

95
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>I kept thinking that I was not go off a cliff.</v>

96
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.080
<v Speaker 1>So finally I can make the right turn and I'm taking my shirt off at this point.</v>

97
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:30.601
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>

98
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm down to a Guinea tee shirt.</v>

99
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 1>The sunroof was open,</v>

100
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.531
<v Speaker 1>the windows are open,</v>

101
00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:37.380
<v Speaker 1>I got the eblast and finally after we realize it's going to make a right,</v>

102
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:38.091
<v Speaker 1>there's a right channel.</v>

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Right now I'm driving on sheet number.</v>

104
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.703
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

105
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking hot and I need something to drink,</v>

106
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:44.850
<v Speaker 1>but I'm cutting stone to get out of the fucking car.</v>

107
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.871
<v Speaker 1>So what do I do?</v>

108
00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:49.680

167
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz gave me once,</v>

168
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>gave me like some breath strips I guess is the first time I take him breath</v>

169
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:41.790
<v Speaker 1>strips and he was like,</v>

170
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.130
<v Speaker 1>eat two of these and I'm like,</v>

171
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.520
<v Speaker 1>I only took half of one of these knowing him and I was driving home on the</v>

172
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:53.360
<v Speaker 1>interstate and was like,</v>

173
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

174
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.150
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely the apocalypse world is ending.</v>

175
00:04:57.151 --> 00:04:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I see that clearly now there was a Mcdonald's,</v>

176
00:04:59.661 --> 00:05:03.570
<v Speaker 1>but now he's going to stop my car and run to the Mcdonald's to get a burger.</v>

177
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.040
<v Speaker 1>He's traffic wasn't moving.</v>

178
00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.500
<v Speaker 1>That's how bad the logic was working in my mind.</v>

179
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.921
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm laying in bed.</v>

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.800
<v Speaker 1>What is her name?</v>

203
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.221

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.343
<v Speaker 1>Judy.</v>

206
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

207
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.130
<v Speaker 1>so this is what happens.</v>

208
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:44.521
<v Speaker 1>She goes on to say,</v>

209
00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:45.354
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't have said her name,</v>

210
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.840
<v Speaker 1>she was on stage.</v>

211
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.650
<v Speaker 1>So she's,</v>

212
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.910
<v Speaker 1>she's on stage and she's not doing real well and we all barbecue now.</v>

213
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.780
<v Speaker 1>It was a small crowd.</v>

214
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>So watches onstage,</v>

215
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Joey into the back area,</v>

216
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 1>there's like this backstage area that's like in the,</v>

217
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:02.770
<v Speaker 1>or the O is a small room.</v>

218
00:06:02.771 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 1>It only seats about a buck 50 but it does have a stage with a little backstage</v>

219
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

220
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.490
<v Speaker 1>So Joey goes into the best day day.</v>

221
00:06:08.491 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Jerry,</v>

222
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>he goes to the backstage area,</v>

223
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 1>it takes off all his clothes and he waits.</v>

224
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 1>And so she's doing her act and when she gets to our punchlines,</v>

225
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.940
<v Speaker 1>she hits the punchline and Joey opens the curtains and shakes his thick and then</v>

226
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 1>closes them up real quick.</v>

227
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 1>And the people go crazy.</v>

228
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 1>And you see this spark in her eye,</v>

229
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.363
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

230
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.613
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>

231
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm finally doing it.</v>

232
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 1>You could see a relax and every time she had a punchline,</v>

233
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:36.640
<v Speaker 1>jelly would pop open.</v>

234
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 1>That curtain shakes day.</v>

235
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>They close it and the people were fucking just stomping their feet,</v>

236
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.131
<v Speaker 1>laughing,</v>

237
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 1>slapping their tables.</v>

238
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 1>She had so much confidence in the next night.</v>

239
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 1>You remember the last of the next time we saw her on stage and looked at the</v>

240
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:49.731
<v Speaker 1>same jokes,</v>

241
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 1>just just didn't,</v>

242
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.943
<v Speaker 1>didn't work.</v>

243
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.083
<v Speaker 1>It was like</v>

244
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.140
<v Speaker 1>she had the magic cause she had it for one night.</v>

245
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 3>But the weird thing is remember when Alison was on and we had talked about this</v>

246
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.260
<v Speaker 3>being a open mic comic and how a lot of these guys are doing these tricks and</v>

247
00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:08.200
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that Allison was talking about is how this guy wanted her to</v>

248
00:07:08.201 --> 00:07:13.201
<v Speaker 3>pay $100 in order to do five minutes in the belly ring belly room and she was</v>

249
00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:16.330
<v Speaker 3>going to do that because she thought that's what you had to do to be an open mic</v>

250
00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:17.590
<v Speaker 3>comic hundred dollars.</v>

251
00:07:17.591 --> 00:07:18.424
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

252
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.920

258
00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:28.050

259
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.930

326
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.940
<v Speaker 1>The reason why we never got arrested was because the guy that was my base was</v>

327
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 1>the chief's son when I was growing up.</v>

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.460
<v Speaker 1>They'll come back then don't make believe like they're looking for directions</v>

342
00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:54.061
<v Speaker 1>and then they'll go,</v>

350
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:02.514
<v Speaker 1>I'll suck your Dick.</v>

351
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.241

456
00:13:32.831 --> 00:13:33.820
