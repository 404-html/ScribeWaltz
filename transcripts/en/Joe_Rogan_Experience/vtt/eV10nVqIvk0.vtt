00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Good experience,</v>

2
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night.</v>

3
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.593
<v Speaker 1>All Day</v>

4
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.280
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be in shape.</v>

5
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 1>How many guys can you shoot with?</v>

6
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.563
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Those are tough to.</v>

8
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>I've seen.</v>

9
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I've seen really big guy is not going to pull just because it's an awkward and</v>

10
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

11
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a different deal</v>

12
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.240
<v Speaker 1>that feel that you're used to that.</v>

13
00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:54.074
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

14
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.003
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

15
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I like this because you can really get a good grip to all four fingers as</v>

16
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>opposed to like the thing wrapped around.</v>

17
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.120
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to see because normally you don't want to grip it [inaudible] like I,</v>

18
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't grip it at all because when you're gripping it,</v>

19
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>that's one more thing to like.</v>

20
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean if I'm gripping this,</v>

21
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

22
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>you can have pork on there and it's gonna.</v>

23
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna to pull it,</v>

24
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.271
<v Speaker 1>to pull it.</v>

25
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:25.104
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

26
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.943
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder,</v>

27
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.240
<v Speaker 1>are you still gripping when you're just relaxing to.</v>

28
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

29
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.240
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

30
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.661
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

31
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:32.670
<v Speaker 1>you want to be as relaxed as possible.</v>

32
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Don't come up to just put it here.</v>

34
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

35
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like with this second round,</v>

36
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.803
<v Speaker 1>give it good.</v>

37
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.531
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

38
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:11.364
<v Speaker 1>and you're used to it.</v>

39
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.910
<v Speaker 1>It was nice to be here.</v>

40
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.133
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

41
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.743
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

42
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.530
<v Speaker 1>So did you get a factor over a spider in this way?</v>

43
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Because they don't make a spider at 90 pounds with that carbon and with the it's</v>

44
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.210
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

45
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.170
<v Speaker 1>It's long.</v>

46
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.850
<v Speaker 1>So this is 30 inches and it's aluminum.</v>

47
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.393
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

48
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.360
<v Speaker 1>they just didn't want to do a 90 pounder and that they thought there might be or</v>

49
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:42.230
<v Speaker 1>they never said why,</v>

50
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.070
<v Speaker 1>but probably the engineer just sat there might be too much riser torquing or</v>

51
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.180
<v Speaker 1>whatever that much pounded show.</v>

52
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.590
<v Speaker 1>They don't even give me that one for people.</v>

53
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

54
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.823
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

55
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.903
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

56
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.350
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

57
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.190
<v Speaker 1>This is why.</v>

58
00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.083
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's,</v>

59
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh you don't need to shoot 90 pounds in the bows bowser so efficient.</v>

60
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.843
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

61
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>as much as I want.</v>

62
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.513
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

63
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

64
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.050
<v Speaker 1>it's 300 horsepower.</v>

65
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Good within $600 product.</v>

66
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 1>That's my monkey mindset.</v>

67
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

68
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.043
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

69
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.311
<v Speaker 1>I just think,</v>

70
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:21.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:22.384
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to</v>

72
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have had the chance to kill you,</v>

73
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 1>you go into the woods with like glocks and like a fucking Samurai sword or some</v>

75
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

76
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>like five miles away and then you shoot it and then you set it up.</v>

77
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's like big and scary when in reality it was like drinking water and taking</v>

78
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:48.391
<v Speaker 1>a shit but at the same dust as a pig from to home ranch fence up here guys,</v>

79
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.100
<v Speaker 1>we were upstanding.</v>

80
00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:53.280
<v Speaker 1>I'll share with shot for the teeth on that motherfucker.</v>

81
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.310
<v Speaker 1>These things are tough to when you eat them</v>

82
00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

83
00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.990
<v Speaker 1>This I shot,</v>

84
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>this one says to home ranch and so like a hour and half of it's a big fucking</v>

85
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.903
<v Speaker 1>swamp.</v>

86
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 1>It looks like that thing</v>

87
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 1>like or recommend your tongue.</v>

88
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not gaining.</v>

89
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 1>It tastes good but they're all muscle the muscle and you have to marry the shit</v>

90
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 1>out of me.</v>

91
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Like the Loin pork,</v>

92
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.331
<v Speaker 1>pork loin.</v>

93
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like the softest.</v>

94
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Most tend to have a regular pick.</v>

95
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.870
<v Speaker 1>But I'm like a wild pigs.</v>

96
00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 1>I eat a bodybuilder because like my kids were like why is this shit?</v>

97
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.360
<v Speaker 1>So Chili</v>

98
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 1>is everywhere.</v>

99
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 1>It's fighting over a mate which playing other people for like pissing territory.</v>

100
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

101
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty crazy.</v>

102
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>And they have so many of them.</v>

103
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 1>This one branch is 50,000 pigs,</v>

104
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.310
<v Speaker 1>$50,000 and they have at least 16 outlines,</v>

105
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 1>maybe 20 mountain lions.</v>

106
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.170
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know how many they have,</v>

107
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:01.840
<v Speaker 1>but they've got like a bunch of pictures from this one,</v>

108
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 1>the pond where the animals come to drink and they have like a bunch of different</v>

109
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:07.180
<v Speaker 1>model lines.</v>

110
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.910
<v Speaker 1>I could at least 16 of them that I take pictures with this camera trap.</v>

111
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:10.744
<v Speaker 1>They have their</v>

112
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>50,000 pigs.</v>

113
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Twenty minute live me.</v>

114
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking.</v>

115
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

116
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Wild Africa shit.</v>

117
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Pigs will kill you to pluck you out of the.</v>

118
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Well the big ones will,</v>

119
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.920
<v Speaker 1>they'll cut you up for sure.</v>

120
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 1>You know even if you get away those tasks is very dangerous,</v>

121
00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 1>but people certainly not from Pitt.</v>

122
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>I saw when I saw this,</v>

123
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.210
<v Speaker 1>this was like a water buffalo and it's baby was getting eaten by like two lions,</v>

124
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>jumbos baby and distinct.</v>

125
00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Just put his head down and they have like this specific trip where they put</v>

126
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 1>their horn almost as if it's rubbing the ground.</v>

127
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't get low enough to the.</v>

128
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 1>He was rubbing the foreign across the ground and as soon as he felt it near the</v>

129
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>cat,</v>

130
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>he just pulled it up and I'll fucking full grown bitch line flew in the air.</v>

131
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Is that a fucking water was cut from the.</v>

132
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 1>He'll do almost a had a hole in here.</v>

133
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>But when you saw it,</v>

134
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 1>he had cooked the skin itself here because the skin is so tight,</v>

135
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>the skin and this should just flew in the air.</v>

136

<v Speaker 1>So you fully flew by skin ripping documentary.</v>

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I've watched it.</v>

140
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 1>I've watched it like completely for like two months straight.</v>

141
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Then it's like,</v>

145
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 1>and the only thing they could do was fucking bang out.</v>

146
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.950
<v Speaker 1>It gets to the point where I was at a point where they're just like,</v>

147
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:34.784
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

148

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.930
<v Speaker 1>So I kinda like la gangs in the nineties.</v>

154
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.310
<v Speaker 1>It's way crazy.</v>

155
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Like father knows best and then right after I will slip don't ad is when the</v>

156
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 1>footage came out of the,</v>

157
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:52.851
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

158
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 1>the alligators in the same situation.</v>

159
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:55.280
<v Speaker 1>What was that called again?</v>

160
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

161
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 1>It's the triangulation.</v>

162
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:57.764
<v Speaker 1>What was the alligators?</v>

163
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Alligators fighting over to delegate or water buffalo shit.</v>

164
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:03.940
<v Speaker 1>The lion was cracking down</v>

165
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 1>and they were all trying to get like a.</v>

166
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 1>An animal.</v>

167
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

168
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

169
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 1>They're like fighting over the issue that I see that I love to watch his killer</v>

170
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 1>whales when they unison what's illustrated.</v>

171
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.740
<v Speaker 1>That DNA is mostly related to peck animals like wolves.</v>

172
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 1>They're smart as fuck,</v>

173
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:21.680
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

174
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Those things come after the election is this.</v>

175
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.100
<v Speaker 1>They showed them keeping a seal alive for like five,</v>

176
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:29.510
<v Speaker 1>six hours and what they say,</v>

177
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:33.110
<v Speaker 1>what sort of blue moon after they're done biting it and flipping it in the air</v>

178
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 1>and giving it to the baby,</v>

179
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.480
<v Speaker 1>they'll let one go.</v>

180
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Like once in a blue moon when I had to,</v>

181
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to fucking traumatized that type of must be traumatized,</v>

182
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 1>but every single one of them gets thrown into fucking air.</v>

183
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Flipped around for like four or five hours to show the baby how to do it because</v>

184
00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:55.301
<v Speaker 1>they always have like four big like adults and then they always have like a baby</v>

185
00:07:55.461 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 1>with them to teach and the baby does Elisha to you think that he's not working</v>

186
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.550
<v Speaker 1>to working.</v>

187
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.630
<v Speaker 1>You can see them pop up like that.</v>

188
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Just to remind the seal.</v>

189
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't come this way too.</v>

190
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the one where they had them on the Ice Shelf?</v>

191
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:08.744
<v Speaker 1>They had to</v>

192
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.900
<v Speaker 1>weigh in on one side and making them slide towards them and they were teaching</v>

193
00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:16.480
<v Speaker 1>the baby how to do it.</v>

194
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.990
<v Speaker 1>It was fine and as soon as he fell in the water,</v>

195
00:08:18.991 --> 00:08:21.260
<v Speaker 1>that was probably night night done.</v>

196
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Shut down the city for Nico to smart man.</v>

197
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Keeping them in the cage,</v>

198
00:08:26.241 --> 00:08:27.710
<v Speaker 1>keeping them in a fish tank like that.</v>

199
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:30.180
<v Speaker 1>It's just wait for it to us that slavery</v>

200
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:32.623
<v Speaker 1>slavery,</v>

201
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.550
<v Speaker 1>just because they don't understand what they're saying.</v>

202
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.280
<v Speaker 1>We pretended not just like almost like people.</v>

203
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.731
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

204
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Some dumb fucking people that I would think like a dolphin will probably smarter</v>

205
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:43.910
<v Speaker 1>than really fucking dumb.</v>

206
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Killer went up probably a lot of them.</v>

207
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.570
<v Speaker 1>They're really smart man.</v>

208
00:08:47.571 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 1>We just don't think of them as smart because we don't see them altering their</v>

209
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 1>environment like we do,</v>

210
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.210
<v Speaker 1>but if you pay attention to everything else,</v>

211
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

212
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:54.973
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

213
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 1>they have with good companions for life.</v>

214
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 1>They stick together with these parts.</v>

215
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>They have different dialects in different regions.</v>

216
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Might as well be people,</v>

217
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:03.690
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

218
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>we're just.</v>

219
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.630
<v Speaker 1>We're just saying they're not people because they don't change their</v>

220
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

221
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 1>but their smartest fucking people.</v>

222
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

223
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 1>They're just.</v>

224
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.920
<v Speaker 1>They're living in a different world,</v>

225
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.050
<v Speaker 1>but they don't wear nothing new.</v>

226
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 1>They don't wear anything.</v>

227
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.270
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

228
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 1>They don't build houses.</v>

229
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 1>They already got some flossing on</v>

230
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 1>a rolled up.</v>

231
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Rocking some shit though.</v>

232
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:23.490
<v Speaker 1>You'd think so different about them.</v>

233
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:24.803
<v Speaker 1>There were closed.</v>

234
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:25.780
<v Speaker 1>We were except Tuxedo.</v>

235
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Everyday though took seed.</v>

236
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I can wait to see what we're so goofy if they were wearing the shit that they</v>

237
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.040
<v Speaker 1>killed it,</v>

238
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.400
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

239
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.233
<v Speaker 1>oh</v>

240
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.210
<v Speaker 1>well that has a giant horn on.</v>

241
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 1>We came out with that.</v>

242
00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:46.734
<v Speaker 1>Is this cane</v>

243
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.053
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

244
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.423
<v Speaker 1>Unicorns?</v>

245
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.913
<v Speaker 1>There's just.</v>

246
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they have one.</v>

247
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.550
<v Speaker 1>There's one that has to,</v>

248
00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.551
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>

249
00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:04.551
<v Speaker 1>Which is why they were mistaken for like seeing animals and in Scandinavia they</v>

250
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:09.540
<v Speaker 1>used to sell the horn as like a fake unicorn bar and there were all kinds of</v>

251
00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:09.820
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

252
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Then it makes perfect sense when you look at.</v>

253
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Imagine what was in the water 10,000 years ago.</v>

254
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.900
<v Speaker 1>People didn't even know.</v>

255
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.540
<v Speaker 1>They had no idea what was out there.</v>

256
00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:25.541
<v Speaker 1>Like now we've only studied 90 percent of your social back then what they one,</v>

257
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.760
<v Speaker 1>one percent and I didn't know then</v>

258
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.840
<v Speaker 1>they had no idea what was in there and you could go out there for fucking days</v>

259
00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:34.290
<v Speaker 1>and days.</v>

260
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:34.711
<v Speaker 1>Never see.</v>

261
00:10:34.711 --> 00:10:35.221
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

262
00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:37.500
<v Speaker 1>And then there's things live underneath you the whole time.</v>

263
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Fuck fuck man.</v>

264
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:40.440
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

265
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.840
<v Speaker 1>that's the trippy shit of all time that people were willing to get that crazy a</v>

266
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.673
<v Speaker 1>few thousand years ago.</v>

267
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

268
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.030
<v Speaker 1>No documentaries to watch,</v>

269
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.130
<v Speaker 1>know Jacques Cousteau,</v>

271
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.900
<v Speaker 1>but they just found that no company.</v>

272
00:10:53.901 --> 00:10:55.290
<v Speaker 1>So giant squishy too.</v>

273
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about that dude that just survived?</v>

274
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:02.600
<v Speaker 1>He was out at sea for over a year and his partner ended up passing away,</v>

275
00:11:02.601 --> 00:11:02.731
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

276
00:11:02.731 --> 00:11:03.001
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

277
00:11:03.001 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

278
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.230
<v Speaker 1>she bought her some shit and family.</v>

279
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:10.370
<v Speaker 1>He's getting mad and he floated from like the Pacific coast of California.</v>

280
00:11:12.091 --> 00:11:14.620
<v Speaker 1>He floated to like some feet,</v>

281
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.560
<v Speaker 1>pretty much pronounced him dead because he was gone for a year.</v>

282
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 1>The rainwater and turtle blood,</v>

283
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.123
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

284
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Stay alive for over a year to 18 months.</v>

285
00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:24.144
<v Speaker 1>I was crushed.</v>

286
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:25.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

287
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:26.503
