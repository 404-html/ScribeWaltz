1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.040
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take like just one small example</v>

2
00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:06.710
<v Speaker 1>of how my belief system works about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this one thing called the</v>

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.660
<v Speaker 1>accumulation mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it a,</v>

5
00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:16.661
<v Speaker 1>I work online with people on fat loss</v>
<v Speaker 1>programs and when you really look at</v>

6
00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>their lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their into the cumulation mode of just</v>

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.510
<v Speaker 1>buying an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amassing all this stuff.</v>

8
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I've been in some people's homes where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shelves are just littered with stuff</v>

9
00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:30.230
<v Speaker 1>they never use or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or don't need,</v>

10
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

11
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.410
<v Speaker 1>they just have so much stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The attic is full of stuff.</v>

12
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 1>That garage is full of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they keep buying more and more.</v>

13
00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Adding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adding,</v>

14
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:37.754
<v Speaker 1>adding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adding.</v>

15
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Their bodies reflect this type of belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>system and for sure they're adding more</v>

16
00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:45.710
<v Speaker 1>cells under their agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just indulgent,</v>

17
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they find themselves over</v>

18
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.080
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating more than their fair share of the</v>

19
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.770
<v Speaker 1>natural resources of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taking more in A.</v>

20
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:59.771
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just like this whole belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>system in accumulation like I need to</v>

21
00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:02.330
<v Speaker 1>add,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to add is all subconscious.</v>

22
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one goes into it,</v>

23
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much do you sleep?</v>

24
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Maybe now that I'm doing all this crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

25
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.910
<v Speaker 2>three hours,</v>

<v Speaker 2>weren't doing this course?</v>

28
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 2>If I'm lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

30
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:18.530
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

31
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.750
<v Speaker 2>it has to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to worry the editing,</v>

32
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I have to do the notes at night so</v>

33
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.390
<v Speaker 2>that they can edit during the day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I go in at night and then now like</v>

34
00:01:26.391 --> 00:01:28.370
<v Speaker 2>with all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with radio as you know,</v>

35
00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:31.060
<v Speaker 2>like radio and all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a weird schedule to</v>

36
00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:33.680
<v Speaker 2>all of that and then doing shows at</v>
<v Speaker 2>night because I never stopped doing</v>

<v Speaker 2>five hours maybe.</v>

40
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Is that because you're all juiced up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with nicotine?</v>

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 1>So I walked into the gym and it was our</v>
<v Speaker 1>last skis first day at Jackson's too.</v>

119
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>when you see a guy on tv fighting all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

121
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:27.940
<v Speaker 1>then you run into me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

122
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I see.</v>

123
00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:29.741
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So then shopper last year in the ring,</v>

125
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>a first day spine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

126
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 1>fresh off the plane and we're sparring</v>
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>

127
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>So me and him are gone and it's a close</v>
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>

128
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad ass right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here we're going back and forth.</v>

129
00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:45.730
<v Speaker 1>People would literally stop and watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>his spar with just these dog rounds back</v>

130
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 1>and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five rounds in a row.</v>

131
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
