00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.500
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take like it's just one small</v>

2
00:00:03.501 --> 00:00:06.710
<v Speaker 1>example of like how my belief system</v>
<v Speaker 1>works about this.</v>

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this one thing called the</v>

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.580
<v Speaker 1>accumulation mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it,</v>

5
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work online with people on fat loss</v>

6
00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:19.160
<v Speaker 1>programs and when you really look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lifestyle,</v>

7
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.180
<v Speaker 1>their into the z accumulation mode of</v>
<v Speaker 1>just buying an amassing all of this</v>

8
00:00:23.181 --> 00:00:25.220
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in some people's homes where</v>

9
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.260
<v Speaker 1>the shelves are just littered with stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never use or don't need.</v>

10
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

11
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:33.410
<v Speaker 1>they just have so much stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The attic is full of stuff,</v>

12
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 1>the garage is full of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they keep buying more and more</v>

13
00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:36.920
<v Speaker 1>adding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adding,</v>

14
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:37.754
<v Speaker 1>adding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adding.</v>

15
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.560
<v Speaker 1>The body's reflect this type of belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>system and for sure they're adding more</v>

16
00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:45.710
<v Speaker 1>cells under their body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just indulge it,</v>

17
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.330
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they find themselves over</v>

18
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.110
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating more than their fair share of the</v>

19
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.710
<v Speaker 1>natural resources of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taking more n a,</v>

20
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just like this whole belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>system in accumulation.</v>

21
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Like I need to add,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to add is all subconscious.</v>

22
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one goes into it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I have to worry of the editing.</v>

33
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:21.381
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

34
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:24.080
<v Speaker 2>like I have to do the notes at night so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can edit during the day.</v>

35
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:27.020
<v Speaker 2>And then I go in at night and then now</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with all these,</v>

36
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:29.420
<v Speaker 2>like with radio as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like radio and all that stuff,</v>

42
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Is that because you're all juiced up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with nicotine all the time?</v>

118
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.340
<v Speaker 1>The two fighters that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first got into the game that I</v>

119
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:17.341
<v Speaker 1>admired and loved where Mirko Cro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cop and Andrea are Laski by two very</v>

120
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:18.910
<v Speaker 1>favorites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's who I wanted to be like.</v>

121
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 1>So I walked in the gym and it was our</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost keys first day at Jackson's too.</v>

122
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.520
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>when you seen a guy in TV fighting all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

124
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:27.940
<v Speaker 1>then you run into me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

125
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I see him like,</v>

126
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this under lawsky.</v>

127
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.110
<v Speaker 1>So then like I shop her last year in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ring,</v>

128
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>first day spine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

129
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>fresh off the plane and we're sparring</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

130
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>So me and him are gone and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a close round.</v>

131
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>He's a Badass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

132
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm are going back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would literally stop and watch a</v>

133
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 1>spar were just these dog rounds back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>

134
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>five rounds in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then later that night we grapple and</v>

135
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:53.740
<v Speaker 1>then the next morning I drink coffee</v>
<v Speaker 1>every morning.</v>

136
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or drinking coffee,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's not very warm person at all.</v>
