1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the eve of an epic weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fights we come to live to break this</v>

2
00:00:09.261 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 1>shit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Quito kid.</v>

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 1>What's up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro?</v>

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.043
<v Speaker 1>What's up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro?</v>

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shirt reminds me of something and</v>

6
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure out what it reminds</v>
<v Speaker 1>me of some Japanese in the summer.</v>

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>That was summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking summer.</v>

8
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.860
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the yellow and I gave you</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

9
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>The yellow one is so summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fighter and the kid shirt with</v>

10
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is such a perfect shirt for Brian.</v>

11
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.480
<v Speaker 1>All of his pictures should be him</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaping pretending to be a ballerina for</v>

12
00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>ells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The endless summer.</v>

13
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similar.</v>

14
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar.</v>

15
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.600
<v Speaker 1>So it's a collab with roots of faith</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we got the idea.</v>

16
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>That's this summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your summer?</v>

17
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Every day in Venice Beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

18
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're a bum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was summer though.</v>

19
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hottest fucking a nice Tan.</v>

20
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.370
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice Tan.</v>

21
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

22
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you right now.</v>

23
00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>You don't wanna be on Venice beach</v>
<v Speaker 1>during July.</v>

24
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Fourth at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that do I even posted?</v>

25
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>It was like the purge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was scared.</v>

26
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>I might get in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking google guns,</v>

27
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.230
<v Speaker 1>fireworks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke.</v>

28
00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy garments.</v>

29
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.020
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

30
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.390
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just shoot up in the air to those.</v>

31
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>But they're not like shooting towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ocean,</v>

32
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a rap video.</v>

33
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I'd fucking flew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was stressed to.</v>

34
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.600
<v Speaker 1>I've been to Venice a few times and</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I'm there I'm like,</v>

35
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:26.890
<v Speaker 1>why would anybody live here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

36
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>you live in the middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where secluded.</v>

37
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>I know that's your style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to be able to be more in the</v>

38
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.130
<v Speaker 1>middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go straight to the woods off</v>

39
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>

40
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Your kids might not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

41
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they'd like Venice either.</v>

42
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.490
<v Speaker 1>There's a comfortable medium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's parts of Venice like what?</v>

43
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Like you on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Kenny was just crowded as well.</v>

44
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:52.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a nice little restaurants there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good spot to drop.</v>

45
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Bank gets neat and true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's packed and feel happy that you</v>

46
00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>don't live there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.230
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See I live like away from the word</v>

48
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 1>slower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like del Rey,</v>

49
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>right on the beat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>

50
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 1>If you have like a Prius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good place to live because the</v>

51
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>parking spots were all like Prius sized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I can walk and that's why I</v>

52
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.960
<v Speaker 1>said because I like to be able to walk</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere to the genome.</v>

53
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ride my bike.</v>

54
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Run on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would run on the beach.</v>

55
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>We're here at Sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

56
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could run hills though.</v>

57
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>It's cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

58
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>He like to run the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't be a better path,</v>

60
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:26.004
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

61
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>You just like being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't.</v>

62
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>You don't want neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.460
<v Speaker 1>this overpopulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that I don't like neighbors.</v>

64
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a very clear overpopulation</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

65
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Like A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you I went to yellowstone a</v>

66
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks ago and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I got out of that about</v>

67
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.680
<v Speaker 1>being in Montana and Wyoming is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you feel more at peace when you</v>

68
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>look at nature and there's less people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more relaxing.</v>

69
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not the hustle.</v>

70
00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>I think you need both though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a reason why there's no one</v>

71
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in the middle of fucking nowhere.</v>

72
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Your neighbors were the grizzly bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the reason.</v>

73
00:02:58.441 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>The big reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The winter,</v>

74
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.370
<v Speaker 2>the winter comes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can keep that and you like that shit</v>

75
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 2>out of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just stay inside.</v>

76
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Make a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your kids are going to be miserable.</v>

77
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 2>You Muslim out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

78
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they enjoy it,</v>

79
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 2>so I saw a bunch of happy kids out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

80
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 2>If you move them out for good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have cell phones out there.</v>

81
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 2>They have internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very few differences culturally,</v>

82
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 2>friends to have each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

83
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of pizza there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just said there's 35,000 people in</v>

84
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:33.964
<v Speaker 2>the town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot.</v>

85
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's more than I thought.</v>

86
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 2>How many people are in Venice?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least a million to 20 million Venice.</v>

87
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Winning the size of a football field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a million people live in their.</v>

88
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.501
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abot.</v>

89
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 2>Kenny just got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not a good thing,</v>

90
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 2>but per square foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the most expensive street in Los</v>

91
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Angeles.</v>

92
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Just beat out rodale drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

93
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 2>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beyond me.</v>

94
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>

95
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 2>I've seen real estate in Venice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

96
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:05.470
<v Speaker 2>I saw a house that was for sale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was $14,000,000 and it was a house</v>

97
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 2>just to fucking house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's Venice man.</v>

98
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 2>It's to great restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendly people,</v>

99
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Venice foot guys walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not not,</v>

100
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:19.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know when,</v>

101
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 2>when I first moved there like way way</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the day I used to visit them</v>

102
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 2>there and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck are you doing here man?</v>

103
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Like why here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

104
00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 2>but when you first moved here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were you Hollywood?</v>

105
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I first lived in Burbank at one of those</v>

106
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Oakwood apartments and then I moved to</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Hollywood.</v>

107
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 2>My car got broken into and then I moved</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Encino.</v>

108
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean North Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a hustle too.</v>

109
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.543
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

110
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been in done that like city life.</v>

111
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.700
<v Speaker 2>It's just too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

112
00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:53.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think it's healthy.</v>

113
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 2>I think when mean I think you can deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it,</v>

114
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.280
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an effect of too many people on</v>

115
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 2>you all the time around you all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

116
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:03.281
<v Speaker 2>Buzz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buzz,</v>

117
00:05:03.281 --> 00:05:05.230

118
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.270
<v Speaker 2>I think it affects your thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

119
00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 2>I think it makes you accelerate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they did a study with a put cameras</v>

120
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:16.580
<v Speaker 2>up and cities and they monitored the</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of footsteps that people take per</v>

121
00:05:16.581 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 2>minute and through the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>footsteps that people take per minute</v>

122
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 2>and the amount of syllables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As people speak per minute,</v>

123
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 2>they can accurately determine how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>people live in that city.</v>

124
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

125
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Like down to like a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

126
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:32.180
<v Speaker 2>they can tell you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's one?</v>

127
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 2>This is 2 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a city of 5 million people.</v>

128
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.370
<v Speaker 2>This is a city of 6 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could tell by watching people walk</v>

129
00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:42.220
<v Speaker 2>and by listening to people talk because</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's too many people around,</v>

130
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 2>everything run ramps up and accelerates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was in Wyoming,</v>

131
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but driving around yellowstone,</v>

132
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:53.140
<v Speaker 2>it's so peaceful and relaxed and I came</v>
<v Speaker 2>back here and the moment we started</v>

133
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 2>driving home I started feeling it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

134
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>everyone's driving faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's cutting everybody</v>

135
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.910
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

136
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>this is a direct response to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>overpopulation issue.</v>

137
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Is it overpopulation or is it the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hustle?</v>

138
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:05.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this,</v>

139
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 1>the American mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hustle where you got to make money,</v>

140
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>get a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide.</v>

141
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.490
<v Speaker 1>If it was Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't hustling to go make money</v>

142
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 1>to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just cutting each other off.</v>

143
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bummer.</v>

144
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 1>And plus people don't really talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other anymore.</v>

145
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

146
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 1>well I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People aren't as valuable.</v>

147
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see those things about Pablo</v>

148
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Escobar that he's to light fires with</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a million dollars?</v>

149
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he had so much fucking money.</v>

150
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:37.670
<v Speaker 1>A million dollars wasn't shit to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happens with people.</v>

151
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 1>If you live in a place that has 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>million people stuffed into it,</v>

152
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 1>if you don't value people the way you</v>
<v Speaker 1>value people,</v>

153
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:46.940
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a small town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense,</v>

154
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.070
<v Speaker 1>but you also don't know him either</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't.</v>

155
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

156
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.430
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

157
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you'd know less people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is weird.</v>

158
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was talking to Jim Norton about</v>

159
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 1>that because Jim Norton lives in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>big ass apartment building in New York</v>

160
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>City and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody.</v>

161
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said hi once to a guy that's down</v>

162
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 1>the hallway from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody else in the</v>

163
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:06.680
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

164
00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:08.100
<v Speaker 1>how many people you think live in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings?</v>

165
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Which thousand dollars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe more than 1000 people in the</v>

166
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:13.880
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go out of your way though to</v>

167
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:15.940
<v Speaker 1>meet people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like last night I was at dinner at</v>

168
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Benihanas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When's the last time I went to Bennett?</v>

169
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 1>You kids like Benihanas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

170
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:21.750
<v Speaker 1>we go to that place right there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to.</v>

171
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Don't dot my girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her family.</v>

172
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we.</v>

173
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went there and they sit with you sit</v>

174
00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:29.340
<v Speaker 1>with random people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

175
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to start a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we were having dinner together.</v>

176
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:35.120
<v Speaker 1>We're here for the long haul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's can show just not getting your</v>

177
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:38.210
<v Speaker 1>steak and then dipping out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's throwing shrimp at your face and</v>

178
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:40.940
<v Speaker 1>all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying to talk to them and it was</v>

179
00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 1>exhausting man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you would think they wanted</v>

180
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 1>something from me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

181
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.111
<v Speaker 1>Like was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

182
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I literally just a friendly</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

183
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.970
<v Speaker 1>So it was weird because we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that last night.</v>

184
00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:50.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one really talks to each other</v>

185
00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:55.241
<v Speaker 1>anymore and this is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid I went to Benihanas and</v>

186
00:07:56.001 --> 00:08:00.650
<v Speaker 1>someone paid for my meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid for the table and I remember I word</v>

187
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:02.270
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken and shrimp and I only had like</v>

188
00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:06.190
<v Speaker 1>$20 in my pocket and I was so stressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had to drink water and all this</v>

189
00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:07.660
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So someone paid for the meal and it was</v>

190
00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:09.170
<v Speaker 1>like the best day of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

191
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:10.280
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to pay it forward.</v>

192
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.260
<v Speaker 1>So before we sat down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know anyone.</v>

193
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.420
<v Speaker 1>I just gave the lady my card behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

194
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:16.910
<v Speaker 1>like I'm gonna cover the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

195
00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:17.744
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

<v Speaker 1>People I'm trying to talk with.</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

253
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:47.730
<v Speaker 1>on the fucking warpath against Mitch</v>

254
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.700
<v Speaker 1>After dust employee a put a beating on</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and he did.</v>

<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

256
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.440
<v Speaker 1>He is this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is he now?</v>

257
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Forty two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 three.</v>

258
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.500
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing it for ever Griffin's</v>
<v Speaker 1>coach before.</v>

259
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Forces fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legendary Jim fighter.</v>

260
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Legendary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like before he ever became a UFC guy.</v>

261
00:11:07.681 --> 00:11:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody would talk about him</v>
<v Speaker 1>handling dudes.</v>

262
00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:11.970
<v Speaker 1>I've heard crazy stories about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough guy.</v>

263
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:12.923
<v Speaker 1>How old is he?</v>

264
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least 40,</v>

265
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.400
<v Speaker 1>41.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say 43.</v>

266
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:20.263
<v Speaker 3>Forty,</v>

267
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.113
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40.</v>

268
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Besides Dan Henderson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

269
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.280
<v Speaker 1>a Dan Anderson that young Anderson and</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and probably the same age.</v>

270
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Anderson's 40 now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

271
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.450
<v Speaker 1>but that the lighter weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tougher to maintain this long of a</v>

272
00:11:36.451 --> 00:11:38.430
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of these guys are pissed that</v>

273
00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:41.130
<v Speaker 1>they weren't 46 years ago when t e,</v>
<v Speaker 1>r,</v>

274
00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:44.770
<v Speaker 1>t was in full swing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were the glory days.</v>

275
00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:47.880
<v Speaker 1>The glory days that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

276
00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:48.491
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

277
00:11:48.491 --> 00:11:50.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't have flight path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you on fight pass,</v>

278
00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:54.850
<v Speaker 1>but if that dos Anjos and Eddie Alvarez</v>
<v Speaker 1>cards or that fight is a fight of the</v>

279
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got to play it on,</v>

280
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the people just for notoriety as a,</v>

281
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 1>as a world champion at 55,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hearing Alvarez stories that he's</v>

282
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:08.680
<v Speaker 1>training like a fucking demon man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

283
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:09.301
<v Speaker 1>I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

284
00:12:09.301 --> 00:12:10.840
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw his interview that he did where he</v>

285
00:12:10.841 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 1>said he did 150 rounds of sparring.</v>

286
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.820
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't believe in overtraining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me sir.</v>

287
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's science.</v>

288
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.380
<v Speaker 1>There's overtraining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

289
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:22.480
<v Speaker 1>I think someone just made that up</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't want to train that</v>

290
00:12:22.481 --> 00:12:23.314
<v Speaker 1>date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

291
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>

292
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:29.230
<v Speaker 1>you look at his last two fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We beat Pettis and he beat Melendez.</v>

293
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.730
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

294
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:31.571
<v Speaker 1>it's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

295
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:33.460
<v Speaker 1>granted he beat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not impressive.</v>

296
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.490
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not like the dream Eddie Alvarez or</v>

297
00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:39.640
<v Speaker 1>the belt or do knocking dudes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't see that Eddie Alvarez</v>

298
00:12:39.641 --> 00:12:41.690
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said that's that that was his</v>

299
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.960
<v Speaker 1>plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think that a good part of</v>

300
00:12:43.961 --> 00:12:46.390
<v Speaker 1>that is because of the competition that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's facing?</v>

301
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean he just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure he's facing the toughest guys in</v>

302
00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:52.540
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you change your fighting style?</v>

303
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:53.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think he's capable of</v>

304
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.480
<v Speaker 1>fighting the same way against those</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

305
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.870
<v Speaker 1>And winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that you can go balls</v>

306
00:12:58.871 --> 00:13:03.820
<v Speaker 1>out against pedis and just slug it out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with him the way he slugged it out with</v>

307
00:13:03.821 --> 00:13:06.760
<v Speaker 1>some guys and other organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

308
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:07.301
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

309
00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:09.010
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went kind of,</v>

310
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.490
<v Speaker 1>he traded with Melendez but he has like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this clinching game now,</v>

311
00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:13.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's this thing,</v>

312
00:13:13.531 --> 00:13:16.360
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't match up for him.</v>

313
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Melendez got a lot of miles on them now</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this stage of his career as well,</v>

314
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amanda's had some injuries and a bunch</v>

315
00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:23.380
<v Speaker 1>of issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

316
00:13:23.381 --> 00:13:25.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alvis had those fucking wars with</v>

317
00:13:25.901 --> 00:13:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Michael Chandler and you see how good</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Chandler looked the other day.</v>

318
00:13:28.691 --> 00:13:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

319
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.300
<v Speaker 1>he looked good and not just good because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the knockout punch.</v>

320
00:13:34.301 --> 00:13:36.640
<v Speaker 1>But look good before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his footwork and movement,</v>

321
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 1>everything looked good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see him in the UFC.</v>

322
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would too.</v>

323
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Especially after that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

324
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.910
<v Speaker 1>that one punch knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I bet spike is taking care of them.</v>

325
00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I bet they're giving them some good</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

326
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:47.920
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

327
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.400
<v Speaker 1>should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I had a discussion with metro and</v>

328
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.530
<v Speaker 1>the other day and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I discuss his financials but what he's</v>

329
00:13:53.531 --> 00:13:56.010
<v Speaker 1>getting paid and chandler being the</v>
<v Speaker 1>champ [inaudible],</v>

330
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he's getting that paper mitre</v>
<v Speaker 1>on almost got slept.</v>

331
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.650
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got wobbling just crazy and now he's</v>

332
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:04.810
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that's not good.</v>

333
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.040
<v Speaker 1>And he was saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>

334
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:06.821
<v Speaker 1>that's what I told him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

335
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:07.491
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not smart.</v>

336
00:14:07.491 --> 00:14:09.400
<v Speaker 1>And for what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's for a title.</v>

337
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.020
<v Speaker 1>If it's for a title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

338
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Go get your money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Become the champion.</v>

339
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Then rest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fighting some Schmuck,</v>

340
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Somali Thompson guy who fought in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>

341
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you want to fight in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>

342
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.800
<v Speaker 1>So he's going over there to beat this</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

343
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:21.791
<v Speaker 1>But then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

344
00:14:21.791 --> 00:14:23.140
<v Speaker 1>this so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're paying pain,</v>

345
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:24.880
<v Speaker 1>to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>

346
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't say this,</v>

347
00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:31.510
<v Speaker 1>but this is me gauging from his mantra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy work from where he's coming.</v>

348
00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Super easy work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he could probably be both guys in</v>

349
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:35.290
<v Speaker 1>the same night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

350
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.020
<v Speaker 1>But if he did get concussed in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

351
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.480
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he did 100 percent,</v>

352
00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:43.660
<v Speaker 1>he has brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brain suffered some sort of trauma.</v>

353
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't get wobbled and just like not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel anything yet.</v>

354
00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Sat down to like his knees went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his body sat down like it was a big</v>

355
00:14:50.531 --> 00:14:51.560
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been that way.</v>

356
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Like when he fought Roy Nelson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

357
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.060
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even out.</v>

358
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.913
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

359
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.280
<v Speaker 1>you got fucking rocked men maybe don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember it.</v>

360
00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>

361
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.410
<v Speaker 1>You had that brain trauma man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he sat down in the lights turn off</v>

362
00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:05.360
<v Speaker 1>even for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That counts.</v>

363
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>

364
00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:08.900
<v Speaker 1>The brain doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a football head,</v>

365
00:15:08.901 --> 00:15:11.450
<v Speaker 1>if it's punch kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't give a fuck.</v>

366
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.440
<v Speaker 1>It's the brain rattling around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guys take comfort in the fact that</v>

367
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:16.790
<v Speaker 1>there were still conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

368
00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:18.110
<v Speaker 1>was like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go out.</v>

369
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.570
<v Speaker 1>John Hendrick said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing with wonderboy.</v>

370
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go out and I get that,</v>

371
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.010
<v Speaker 1>but if that ref isn't there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your debt.</v>

372
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.570
<v Speaker 1>If this is the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dead.</v>

373
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

374
00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:30.800
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough call for him.</v>

375
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.270
<v Speaker 1>It's tough for Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just like,</v>

376
00:15:32.271 --> 00:15:33.071
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting this dude,</v>

377
00:15:33.071 --> 00:15:34.760
<v Speaker 1>this dude this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether payment of that get your money</v>

378
00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:36.170
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough because,</v>

379
00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:37.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he thinks he could stop it,</v>

380
00:15:37.851 --> 00:15:40.700
<v Speaker 1>but then those are the fights that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you can get fucked up in</v>

381
00:15:40.701 --> 00:15:44.060
<v Speaker 1>because you think it's an easy fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think?</v>

382
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's times where you step in and say,</v>

383
00:15:46.671 --> 00:15:48.830
<v Speaker 1>this is a fight that I can win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty easy.</v>

384
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.830
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's over the overconfidence,</v>

385
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.860
<v Speaker 1>but like rockhold and bisping for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rockhold was overconfident going into</v>

386
00:15:58.581 --> 00:16:00.230
<v Speaker 1>that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little too relaxed.</v>

387
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Almost disdainful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just did not give a fuck.</v>

388
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Just Dot Murray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I woke up my baby up.</v>

389
00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:07.683
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

390
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.310
<v Speaker 1>He jumped out of my seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so scared.</v>

391
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear John Jones talk about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a great point.</v>

392
00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear his interview?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd he say?</v>

393
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.630
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the media was like,</v>

394
00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:19.820
<v Speaker 1>you know all this criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get for Osp,</v>

395
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.200
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on home criticism.</v>

396
00:16:21.201 --> 00:16:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Let's just go over this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was brilliant shit.</v>

397
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.850
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you guys like to see?</v>

398
00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

399
00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:29.030
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was number six guys in the world,</v>

400
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.073
<v Speaker 1>South Ball.</v>

401
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.720
<v Speaker 1>They change it on four day notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some shit like that.</v>

402
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.360
<v Speaker 1>He was the explosive south pulse number</v>
<v Speaker 1>six in the world.</v>

403
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.540
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want me to to act and dance around</v>

404
00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:42.650
<v Speaker 1>and get knocked out like a Anderson</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silva did or maybe you wanted me to go</v>

405
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:44.360
<v Speaker 1>in there and not respect them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get knocked out.</v>

406
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Luke rockhold w and what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you guys want from me?</v>

407
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.373
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

408
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.410
<v Speaker 1>those guys will never be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like once they get knocked out like</v>

409
00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.450
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their legacy is over,</v>

410
00:16:53.451 --> 00:16:53.991
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

411
00:16:53.991 --> 00:16:55.390
<v Speaker 1>that won't be me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't go down.</v>

412
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Go down as the greatest job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will never see me like that.</v>

413
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.720
<v Speaker 1>John Smarter in his approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely smarter and his approach</v>

414
00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:04.370
<v Speaker 1>to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he takes them very seriously.</v>

415
00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Even if he's not 100 percent trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't fight reckless.</v>

416
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.560
<v Speaker 1>He fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fights,</v>

417
00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.500
<v Speaker 1>he takes chances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're calculated chances.</v>

418
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.380
<v Speaker 1>He's improvisational in his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his movements.</v>

419
00:17:15.381 --> 00:17:18.260
<v Speaker 1>But John's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean his,</v>

420
00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:23.300
<v Speaker 1>the reason why he's gotten into fights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not trained very much and you know</v>

421
00:17:23.301 --> 00:17:28.301
<v Speaker 1>and like been like fairly out of shape</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just his massive believer in what</v>

422
00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:31.100
<v Speaker 1>he's been able to pull off inside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>octagon.</v>

423
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.520
<v Speaker 1>But you would think especially out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was he 22 years old when he won the</v>

424
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.120
<v Speaker 1>world title against Shogun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see 1:28 against A.</v>

425
00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:39.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can show you a new work.</v>

426
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.110
<v Speaker 1>So when he's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

427
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:45.050
<v Speaker 1>if anyone's going to get overconfident</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do some bullshit,</v>

428
00:17:45.051 --> 00:17:46.860
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna be Jon Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

429
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.541
<v Speaker 1>That the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

430
00:17:47.541 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's pound for pound best</v>
<v Speaker 1>because look at the guys he's</v>

431
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.100
<v Speaker 2>fighting like DC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He only has one last thing.</v>

432
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Not all the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been that fight.</v>

433
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that close.</v>

434
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.200
<v Speaker 2>NDC got taken down and kind of broke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

435
00:18:01.201 --> 00:18:04.870
<v Speaker 2>So for the guys John's beating and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing to them,</v>

436
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:05.723
<v Speaker 2>that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

437
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.010
<v Speaker 2>he's pound for pound best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>WHO's mighty mouse by next</v>

438
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.820
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

439
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:12.863
<v Speaker 2>Cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

440
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.150
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very cool.</v>

441
00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.220
<v Speaker 2>There's no comp comp comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what's next for John?</v>

442
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.650
<v Speaker 2>Probably gastrin rumble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rumble.</v>

443
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:24.730
<v Speaker 2>He's just fucking monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Glover going to fight in a two O</v>

444
00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:27.600
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So perhaps a winter that.</v>

445
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.830
<v Speaker 2>And we saw how it went against.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just dismantled glover.</v>

446
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just saying at the margin of</v>

447
00:18:33.511 --> 00:18:35.730
<v Speaker 2>error for John and the way beating these</v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes,</v>

448
00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:37.140
<v Speaker 2>that's why he's pound for pound number</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

449
00:18:37.141 --> 00:18:37.974
<v Speaker 2>Greatest for me.</v>

450
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely an argument.</v>

451
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a subjective conversation.</v>

452
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:45.090
<v Speaker 2>I think when you look at the movements</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what mighty mouse was capable of</v>

453
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:47.080
<v Speaker 2>doing it inside the octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody touches,</v>

454
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.700
<v Speaker 2>but look at level of competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

455
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.480
<v Speaker 2>it's also because he's eliminating so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much competition.</v>

456
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.690
<v Speaker 2>Like what could he did to Benevidez?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benevidez is a world class fighter,</v>

457
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.550
<v Speaker 2>knocks him out in the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look what it does.</v>

458
00:18:56.551 --> 00:18:58.510
<v Speaker 2>A Henry Cejudo Olympic gold medal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Merck's.</v>

459
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had four fights.</v>

460
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had more than that,</v>

461
00:19:01.531 --> 00:19:03.660
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I saying in the UFC,</v>

462
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:04.680
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's not,</v>

463
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:09.830
<v Speaker 2>he's not this established bad ass like</v>
<v Speaker 2>St John's Merkin Gusta Fin v tour,</v>

464
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.700
<v Speaker 2>clover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clover trail,</v>

465
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.760
<v Speaker 2>like all these legends to good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

466
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.160
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that interview,</v>

467
00:19:17.161 --> 00:19:17.610
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

468
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:18.960
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so good man.</v>

469
00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.360
<v Speaker 2>Because do you guys are gonna criticize</v>
<v Speaker 2>me for this?</v>

470
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.040
<v Speaker 2>He was in Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

471
00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:24.810
<v Speaker 2>what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They overlooked her opponent.</v>

472
00:19:24.811 --> 00:19:26.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I respect on this p.</v>

473
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:27.451
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

474
00:19:27.451 --> 00:19:29.370
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think that performance was bad</v>

475
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.740
<v Speaker 2>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of respect for Osp.</v>

476
00:19:31.741 --> 00:19:35.040
<v Speaker 2>I think Osp is dangerous as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hits really hard.</v>

477
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.870
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's tough as shit.</v>

478
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.150
<v Speaker 2>And we saw that in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He broke his arm and the fourth round</v>

479
00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:40.800
<v Speaker 2>didn't say God damn thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

480
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.110
<v Speaker 2>very explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't fuck around with Osp and also</v>

481
00:19:44.111 --> 00:19:45.660
<v Speaker 2>a you to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know this like,</v>

482
00:19:45.661 --> 00:19:48.330
<v Speaker 2>it's when people that have never fought</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

483
00:19:48.331 --> 00:19:51.840
<v Speaker 2>when you change from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a traditional stance of south ball,</v>

484
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.270
<v Speaker 2>you're talking world of different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gap plans out the window,</v>

485
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.300
<v Speaker 2>especially with short notice is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

486
00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.350
<v Speaker 2>No it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

487
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.100
<v Speaker 2>and he did it because he realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

488
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was behind the eight ball already</v>

489
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.030
<v Speaker 2>going into that fight with all his</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal problems,</v>

490
00:20:06.031 --> 00:20:10.960
<v Speaker 2>all the bullshit he had to take that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight or he felt like he had to get sort</v>

491
00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.720
<v Speaker 2>of like back in the fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good graces.</v>

492
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:14.550
<v Speaker 2>I did not think it was a bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

493
00:20:14.551 --> 00:20:15.810
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people saying he looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

494
00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.200
<v Speaker 2>I think he fought a really tough guy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fought smart.</v>

495
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't really take that many chances for</v>

496
00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:24.360
<v Speaker 2>really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also his mom that week got her leg</v>

497
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:25.330
<v Speaker 2>amputated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

498
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what,</v>

499
00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:29.760
<v Speaker 2>he didn't fight for what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 months before that.</v>

500
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so 16 months.</v>

501
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:35.730
<v Speaker 2>So he had that because if that same John</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight dc that night,</v>

502
00:20:35.731 --> 00:20:37.030
<v Speaker 2>he had been in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

503
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.520
<v Speaker 2>maybe I don't know or maybe shows maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets another switch.</v>

504
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Well one of the things that he said when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed him after the fight is it</v>

505
00:20:45.421 --> 00:20:47.140
<v Speaker 2>wasn't physical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

506
00:20:47.141 --> 00:20:49.660
<v Speaker 2>physically I felt great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just like,</v>

507
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.420
<v Speaker 2>I just wasn't doing the things that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to do.</v>

508
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't executing when I wanted to.</v>

509
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:58.330
<v Speaker 2>I was hesitating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was under a tremendous amount</v>

510
00:20:58.331 --> 00:21:00.400
<v Speaker 2>of pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean talking about a guy who came that</v>

511
00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:04.900
<v Speaker 2>close to going to jail and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people felt like his,</v>

512
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.350
<v Speaker 2>his choices outside the ring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to lead to his demise.</v>

513
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.860
<v Speaker 2>And there was a lot of talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just the amount of pressure that</v>

514
00:21:11.861 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 2>he had to be under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the scrutiny,</v>

515
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.690
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a lot.</v>

516
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.930
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that is also changed</v>
<v Speaker 2>his camp up quite a bit because you</v>

517
00:21:19.931 --> 00:21:21.340
<v Speaker 2>started doing a lot of power lifting.</v>

518
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear him talk about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

519
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.460
<v Speaker 2>He said that it helped me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hurt him.</v>

520
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:25.900
<v Speaker 2>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not lifting anymore.</v>

521
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

522
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he hasn't lifted this camp.</v>

523
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.183
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

524
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.430
<v Speaker 2>some people believe that you should do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and some people believe that you</v>

525
00:21:33.431 --> 00:21:36.100
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some people believe that it's</v>

526
00:21:36.101 --> 00:21:40.000
<v Speaker 2>something to do in between camps and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what you really should be</v>

527
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:41.830
<v Speaker 2>concentrating on during campus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plyo.</v>

528
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:42.693
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

529
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.960
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the.</v>

530
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.650
<v Speaker 2>And I think most experts agree like</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of camp you build this,</v>

531
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:51.060
<v Speaker 2>this shell just you build your body as</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy,</v>

532
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.430
<v Speaker 2>as big as it can get and then you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>into camp and you ditch that heavy lift</v>

533
00:21:54.431 --> 00:21:56.440
<v Speaker 2>and all that stuff and just focus on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your cardio,</v>

534
00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.540
<v Speaker 2>explosiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>footwork and stuff like that.</v>

535
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.690
<v Speaker 2>I had a really good conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diego about that once Diego Sanchez and</v>

536
00:22:01.691 --> 00:22:04.140
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about how he treats it</v>
<v Speaker 2>dig.</v>

537
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:09.010
<v Speaker 2>It was very smart and as preparation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he takes time like in between the</v>

538
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.910
<v Speaker 2>safety as a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a.</v>

539
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.350
<v Speaker 2>he's fighting Miller this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

540
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:14.161
<v Speaker 2>Lozan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

541
00:22:14.161 --> 00:22:17.410
<v Speaker 2>that's fighting Lozan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's fighting lawyers on this</v>

542
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:18.220
<v Speaker 2>weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

543
00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he just fight Jim Miller?</v>

544
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

545
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.790
<v Speaker 2>He Won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

546
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.730
<v Speaker 2>Beat Jim Miller did know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought Jim Miller one who the fuck</v>

547
00:22:24.731 --> 00:22:27.700
<v Speaker 2>one that find the jail sanction Miller</v>
<v Speaker 2>won by decision.</v>

548
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I just picked them to win,</v>

549
00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.560
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember that fight.</v>

550
00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember that fight at all and</v>
<v Speaker 2>neither.</v>

551
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.100
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

552
00:22:36.101 --> 00:22:36.934
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

553
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so diego does all of his,</v>

554
00:22:40.121 --> 00:22:42.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pre before the fight,</v>

555
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.920
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before fight camp starts,</v>

556
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.580
<v Speaker 2>he does a lot of physical training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get this cardio very high.</v>

557
00:22:48.581 --> 00:22:50.860
<v Speaker 2>He gets his weight lifting up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does all this different stuff,</v>

558
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.090
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't do any sparring.</v>

559
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.240
<v Speaker 2>Who says drilling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does some drilling buddies mostly</v>

560
00:22:55.241 --> 00:22:58.440
<v Speaker 2>concentrating on physical preparation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like weightlifting,</v>

561
00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that jazz.</v>

562
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Then he gets in a peak state of physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>condition than he enters at camp.</v>

563
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.390
<v Speaker 2>Fully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fully trained,</v>

564
00:23:07.391 --> 00:23:09.760
<v Speaker 2>like very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very high rate of cardio.</v>

565
00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Like he's not out of shape when he gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>into camp and then when he's in camp</v>

566
00:23:13.461 --> 00:23:16.240
<v Speaker 2>then he concentrates on a skill sets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

567
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a smart way to do it</v>

568
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.170
<v Speaker 2>because Klitschko does us a complete</v>
<v Speaker 2>different sports.</v>

569
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.830
<v Speaker 2>The Klitschko brothers did it opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would do,</v>

570
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

571
00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:31.020
<v Speaker 2>the first day we call it pre camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just focus on skills and like their</v>

572
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:33.040
<v Speaker 2>jab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the straight right,</v>

573
00:23:33.041 --> 00:23:37.390
<v Speaker 2>the very basics for two or three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when they'd go into camp they'd</v>

574
00:23:37.391 --> 00:23:40.150
<v Speaker 2>add and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the first couple of weeks camp was</v>

575
00:23:40.151 --> 00:23:41.650
<v Speaker 2>just the basics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

576
00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:43.270
<v Speaker 2>very basics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's also,</v>

577
00:23:43.271 --> 00:23:45.070
<v Speaker 2>he's in his forties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Klitschko is right,</v>

578
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is before the.</v>

579
00:23:46.191 --> 00:23:47.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he's doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was before?</v>

580
00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old is Klitschko?</v>

581
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Forty to 42.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say 42.</v>

582
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.620
<v Speaker 2>But am I off on that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie heavily relies on Mexican</v>

583
00:23:55.621 --> 00:23:56.540
<v Speaker 2>supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

584
00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 2>The Russians have been known to dabble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been known and he looks</v>

585
00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.170
<v Speaker 2>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is bodied.</v>

586
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you see what Brock Lesnar said?</v>

587
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm white and I'm jack.</v>

588
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.130
<v Speaker 2>Get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

589
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I liked them.</v>

590
00:24:14.901 --> 00:24:15.850
<v Speaker 2>A lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually liked.</v>

591
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.090
<v Speaker 2>I saw them like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

592
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good free character.</v>

593
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.870
<v Speaker 2>He's a character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking character.</v>

594
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.420
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would bet my entire life that he's</v>

595
00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:25.730
<v Speaker 2>dabbled in some of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just what they do.</v>

596
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:30.200
<v Speaker 2>How when he was over there for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's been tested five times or was</v>

597
00:24:30.201 --> 00:24:31.970
<v Speaker 2>tested five times in the last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard about it.</v>

598
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.800
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

599
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.570
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was clear to this Klitschko and</v>

600
00:24:35.571 --> 00:24:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Tyson fury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy on the right,</v>

601
00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:43.061
<v Speaker 2>beat them 40 by 40 Dad Bod beat him dad</v>
<v Speaker 2>bod beat didn't beat the shit.</v>

602
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but me beat him.</v>

603
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.120
<v Speaker 2>He beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked his head up before the fight.</v>

604
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.580
<v Speaker 2>That was the big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Klitschko beat them in the rematch.</v>

605
00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 2>You think so?</v>

606
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was such a boring fight.</v>

607
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.320
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

608
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:54.921
<v Speaker 2>what we're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

609
00:24:54.921 --> 00:24:57.450
<v Speaker 2>with brock lesnar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear what Mark said?</v>

610
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Mark goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they told me like three months ago,</v>

611
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.720
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be ready for UFC 200 because,</v>

612
00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:04.643
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

613
00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:06.030
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might use you.</v>

614
00:25:06.031 --> 00:25:07.280
<v Speaker 2>So make sure you're in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

615
00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.250
<v Speaker 2>they've never done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

616
00:25:10.251 --> 00:25:13.850
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're bat shit crazy,</v>

617
00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:15.620
<v Speaker 2>if you think brock's for weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

618
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.260
<v Speaker 2>y'all fight at $200,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they going to test me?</v>

619
00:25:18.261 --> 00:25:19.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm clear.</v>

620
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Like it was obviously a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

621
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.900
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not mad at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it for entertainment.</v>

622
00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.590
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait to see the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're batshit crazy if you don't</v>

623
00:25:27.591 --> 00:25:31.170
<v Speaker 2>think this has been an ongoing thing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just saving this fucking bat</v>

624
00:25:31.171 --> 00:25:32.290
<v Speaker 2>card to save the.</v>

625
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.670
<v Speaker 2>I know it was an ongoing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you.</v>

626
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.130
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you everything that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

627
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.590
<v Speaker 2>There was a bunch of difficulties in</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling this off.</v>

628
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it dealt with Vince and Vince</v>

629
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:46.190
<v Speaker 2>Mcmahon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say I call him vince because I don't</v>

630
00:25:46.191 --> 00:25:50.350
<v Speaker 2>know him at all that your friends with</v>
<v Speaker 2>typed.</v>

631
00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:52.520
<v Speaker 2>But boy vinny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

632
00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.500
<v Speaker 2>so there was a lot of work to pull this</v>
<v Speaker 2>off and it was touch and go touch and go</v>

633
00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.050
<v Speaker 2>was they weren't sure whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be able to pull it off.</v>

634
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.990
<v Speaker 2>So it was something that they tried to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get done.</v>

635
00:26:02.991 --> 00:26:07.040
<v Speaker 2>But it took a long fucking time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of finagling and they've</v>

636
00:26:07.041 --> 00:26:09.530
<v Speaker 2>had some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some cooperation before,</v>

637
00:26:09.531 --> 00:26:13.490
<v Speaker 2>like Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she went over there and did some shows,</v>

638
00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or did a show completely and um,</v>

639
00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:16.873
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

640
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.610
<v Speaker 2>but that cross promotion can benefit</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

641
00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:21.440
<v Speaker 2>So I think both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both parties,</v>

642
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.420
<v Speaker 2>both parties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think they wanted to work some</v>

643
00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:26.330
<v Speaker 2>stuff out and figure out how to do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and whether or not there were</v>

644
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.360
<v Speaker 2>going to do it right and whether or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

645
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.640
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it ain't easy to pull those things off</v>

646
00:26:31.641 --> 00:26:36.140
<v Speaker 2>when you've got a company like the wwe</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the UFC and they have egos.</v>

647
00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Then you'll brock's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're freaking boy,</v>

648
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.620
<v Speaker 2>obviously he's their cash cow and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the biggest draw of all time in the</v>

649
00:26:42.621 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>

650
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.870
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what could happen if Mark Hunt</v>
<v Speaker 4>lays them out,</v>

651
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

652
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:54.840
<v Speaker 4>and here's another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the reason why he stepped back,</v>

653
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.350
<v Speaker 4>one of the reasons you talked about when</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said he wasn't going to fight again</v>

654
00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.660
<v Speaker 4>was a few years back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

655
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:03.150
<v Speaker 4>Three years ago he said he was concerned</v>
<v Speaker 4>about concussions.</v>

656
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:04.790
<v Speaker 4>Brock said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

657
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:08.190
<v Speaker 4>it's more cut and he's fighting bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fighting Mr. Concussion,</v>

658
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.720
<v Speaker 4>concussion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking captain over the ask right now.</v>

659
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:13.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

660
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:18.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's fighting one of the best</v>
<v Speaker 4>strikers to ever compete in MMA in the</v>

661
00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:22.290
<v Speaker 4>division head or in the ve world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He gave me a list.</v>

662
00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:23.460
<v Speaker 4>He's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's.</v>

663
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:28.520
<v Speaker 4>He's certainly in the list mean he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>more skillful than you might have a guy</v>

664
00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:32.700
<v Speaker 4>that hits harder than him physically</v>
<v Speaker 4>name someone in the heavyweight division</v>

665
00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.130
<v Speaker 4>knocked out Roy Nelson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sir.</v>

666
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.720
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

667
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:42.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's arguable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Knocked out some monsters,</v>

668
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.490
<v Speaker 4>knocked out a lot of fucking people.</v>

669
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.550
<v Speaker 4>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hit very,</v>

670
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.780
<v Speaker 4>very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why you look at brock and his</v>

671
00:27:48.781 --> 00:27:50.700
<v Speaker 4>career.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I give him shit about the Dodo and all</v>

672
00:27:50.701 --> 00:27:55.701
<v Speaker 4>that as far as an athlete and hit the</v>
<v Speaker 4>balls of doing what he's doing because</v>

673
00:27:55.831 --> 00:27:59.400
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't have that many fights and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just threw him to the fucking dogs.</v>

674
00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.910
<v Speaker 4>You've married?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Started with heath herring.</v>

675
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.450
<v Speaker 4>He was frank mayor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These randy couture,</v>

676
00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.920
<v Speaker 4>far uber dream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fought the Uber and God dealt with.</v>

677
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.800
<v Speaker 4>He said he said the undertaker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

678
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.760
<v Speaker 4>we ain't rehearsing this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's a kick to the straight liver son.</v>

679
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.630
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't worried about being taken down</v>
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>

680
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.630
<v Speaker 4>Didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ubering looks so good enough.</v>

681
00:28:21.631 --> 00:28:22.464
<v Speaker 4>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my.</v>

682
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.690
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the hardest fighter ever to be in</v>

683
00:28:24.691 --> 00:28:26.760
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uber and I was scared.</v>

684
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:28.410
<v Speaker 4>I was still on the roster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

685
00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.880
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if they call me with him?</v>

686
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.700
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck am I going to do the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I going to do?</v>

687
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.760
<v Speaker 4>It's not a good guy to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that one.</v>

688
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's that one.</v>

689
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.620
<v Speaker 4>That's almost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I almost want to see what he could have</v>

690
00:28:40.621 --> 00:28:42.160
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

691
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.260
<v Speaker 4>if we were on old school testing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh everyone getting fucked up.</v>

692
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:47.640
<v Speaker 4>We all go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And sizzler.</v>

693
00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a good picture right there where</v>

694
00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:52.650
<v Speaker 4>you get to see what he looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's.</v>

695
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.400
<v Speaker 4>We don't flex and right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

696
00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.790
<v Speaker 4>that's the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

697
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:58.080
<v Speaker 4>Googling the back.</v>

698
00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.210
<v Speaker 4>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God damn what in the fuck.</v>

699
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:00.841
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

700
00:29:00.841 --> 00:29:03.870
<v Speaker 4>how's he keeping that much mass on with</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that training,</v>

701
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:04.733
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

702
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:07.800
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know exactly how Mexican supplements,</v>

703
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.500
<v Speaker 4>but it's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're crazy girl.</v>

704
00:29:11.501 --> 00:29:13.980
<v Speaker 4>Think Brock was doing some sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fair fight.</v>

705
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

706
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.600
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of things that are fair</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it skillfully.</v>

707
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>skill wise,</v>

708
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:25.200
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>overeem is a far superior MMA fighter,</v>

709
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.680
<v Speaker 4>far superior striking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're on there.</v>

710
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:31.740
<v Speaker 4>It's almost hard to put into context how</v>
<v Speaker 4>much better he states that are on the</v>

711
00:29:31.741 --> 00:29:33.990
<v Speaker 4>same fucking planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

712
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:39.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And overeem knew it too because overeem</v>

713
00:29:39.121 --> 00:29:41.440
<v Speaker 4>had seen brock struggle with Shane</v>

714
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.390
<v Speaker 2>and a scene Brockett beat up by Cain and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knew what he was going to do to him.</v>

715
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was a confident juice to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tits over.</v>

716
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:56.090
<v Speaker 2>He came in that mother fucker guns</v>
<v Speaker 2>blazing but also shit.</v>

717
00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:00.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean he didn't just walk unfortunately</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bullshit.</v>

718
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.960
<v Speaker 2>College double leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shoot that fucking shit.</v>

719
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Ask the Gita how that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like ahead and fucking shoot.</v>

720
00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:11.920
<v Speaker 2>But I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

721
00:30:11.921 --> 00:30:15.940
<v Speaker 2>I liked the way overeem fights now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fighting smart as fuck now.</v>

722
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:18.460
<v Speaker 2>He moves around a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>picks his openings,</v>

723
00:30:18.461 --> 00:30:20.800
<v Speaker 2>throws those leg kicks when he needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

724
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.380
<v Speaker 2>And when he lands bombs on</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers,</v>

725
00:30:23.381 --> 00:30:26.140
<v Speaker 2>he's hurting people killing here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

726
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very skillful,</v>

727
00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.580
<v Speaker 2>very skillful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way for junior dos Santos,</v>

728
00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:33.570
<v Speaker 2>I was heavily impressed and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are juniors.</v>

729
00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you see junior box the fucking</v>

730
00:30:36.431 --> 00:30:38.410
<v Speaker 2>ears off of Ben Rothwell and you go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>junior's.</v>

731
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.290
<v Speaker 2>Not done at all better than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just how good at over him.</v>

732
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.970
<v Speaker 2>It's how good overeem is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

733
00:30:42.971 --> 00:30:47.971
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about a world class</v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxer real world class Grom Prix</v>

734
00:30:49.601 --> 00:30:52.150
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the most decorated guy in the UFC.</v>

735
00:30:52.151 --> 00:30:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Striking wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you think of someone better hunt,</v>

736
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.230
<v Speaker 2>hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt,</v>

737
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

738
00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:00.370
<v Speaker 2>is the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But honestly when the hunt won the Grand</v>

739
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Prix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt lost a decision and then the guy he</v>

740
00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:08.830
<v Speaker 2>fought couldn't go on in the finals and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he went on the finals in one.</v>

741
00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See the grand prixs is sketchy fucking</v>

742
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.710
<v Speaker 2>thing because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a tournament.</v>

743
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.200
<v Speaker 2>And so you got to fight multiple times</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a night.</v>

744
00:31:17.201 --> 00:31:21.610
<v Speaker 2>And if you fight a guy who won by first</v>
<v Speaker 2>round knockout and you went through a</v>

745
00:31:21.611 --> 00:31:25.450
<v Speaker 2>three round war or even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these guys went through through</v>

746
00:31:25.451 --> 00:31:29.710
<v Speaker 2>like when Joe Schilling fought in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>last man standing tournament in Los</v>

747
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Angeles when he fought a Simon Marcus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went three rounds.</v>

748
00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:36.790
<v Speaker 2>It was a draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went to a fourth round and then he</v>

749
00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:39.880
<v Speaker 2>knocked him out in a fourth round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he had been dropped in that fight.</v>

750
00:31:39.881 --> 00:31:44.350
<v Speaker 2>And then you gotta think that fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that is,</v>

751
00:31:44.351 --> 00:31:45.580
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's touch and go.</v>

752
00:31:45.581 --> 00:31:49.300
<v Speaker 2>So the guy who makes it to the finals</v>
<v Speaker 2>might not be the best guy.</v>

753
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.960
<v Speaker 2>He might just be less beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very fuck.</v>

754
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:58.090
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of cool because it had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of luck to do with it a</v>

755
00:31:58.091 --> 00:31:58.990
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

756
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.570
<v Speaker 2>This punch lands I get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

757
00:32:01.571 --> 00:32:05.680
<v Speaker 2>didn't overeem beat go con Saki in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>finals?</v>

758
00:32:05.681 --> 00:32:08.680
<v Speaker 2>And I believe Saki had a broken arm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going into that fight.</v>

759
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:09.730
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

760
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.040
<v Speaker 2>So there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But over him,</v>

761
00:32:12.041 --> 00:32:16.880
<v Speaker 2>as far as just pure striking right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anyone better</v>

762
00:32:16.881 --> 00:32:19.400
<v Speaker 2>knocked out Badr Hari.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

763
00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.480
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing you had already stopped</v>

764
00:32:22.481 --> 00:32:22.900
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

765
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.940
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kod Barnett bought her heart with a</v>

766
00:32:24.941 --> 00:32:29.941
<v Speaker 2>fucking left hook from buhloone fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>way bigger than what's been a high</v>

767
00:32:31.661 --> 00:32:33.100
<v Speaker 2>thinking will bother her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

768
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.330
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

769
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.760
<v Speaker 2>he's been known to dabble in the Mexican</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplements himself.</v>

770
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:38.950
<v Speaker 2>He got pretty God damn big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bought her heart.</v>

771
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Going through a bunch of personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>

772
00:32:41.131 --> 00:32:44.400
<v Speaker 2>had been breaking dude's legs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>nightclubs to therapists are like</v>

773
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.340
<v Speaker 2>planets on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's crazy.</v>

774
00:32:46.341 --> 00:32:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see means fuck all that whole camp.</v>

775
00:32:50.541 --> 00:32:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Mike's Jim's filled with monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just Melvin Melvin manhoef.</v>

776
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got some monsters over their</v>

777
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.000
<v Speaker 2>monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing that my point was,</v>

778
00:32:59.001 --> 00:33:01.580
<v Speaker 2>is for brock with his experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

779
00:33:01.581 --> 00:33:03.140
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snack and monsters.</v>

780
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.590
<v Speaker 2>And right now brock doesn't need money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I'm sure he's getting paid the</v>

781
00:33:06.591 --> 00:33:08.060
<v Speaker 2>most that I have any fighter ever right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

782
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.180
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't need money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just do it for the competition.</v>

783
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which it shows you the type of balls on</v>

784
00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:14.930
<v Speaker 2>this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

785
00:33:14.931 --> 00:33:17.380
<v Speaker 2>he has the type of balls anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're talking about a guy who</v>

786
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:22.400
<v Speaker 2>won the world title against Randy Coture</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his fourth professional fight.</v>

787
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

788
00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:28.880
<v Speaker 2>that is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking crazy.</v>

789
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's David Goliath and David</v>
<v Speaker 2>verse,</v>

790
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:34.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's still randy fucking coture</v>
<v Speaker 2>randy couture.</v>

791
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Even though he might've been the David</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the David versus Goliath.</v>

792
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:42.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a tough out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a tough fucking bullshit.</v>

793
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.070
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Randy has so much experience.</v>

794
00:33:46.071 --> 00:33:49.130
<v Speaker 2>He's so grizzled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where sometimes when like,</v>

795
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well brock just saw and randy is.</v>

796
00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Randy was just trying to strike with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

797
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:57.020
<v Speaker 2>He's like standing in the pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like slugging it out.</v>

798
00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I think he thought that that would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>his best way to win.</v>

799
00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:02.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to keep that big fucker off of</v>

800
00:34:02.571 --> 00:34:07.050
<v Speaker 2>him and dropped him with a punch behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ear.</v>

801
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prock is a gorilla.</v>

802
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.420
<v Speaker 2>He really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just as a fig vanilla gorilla is a freak</v>

803
00:34:11.421 --> 00:34:12.740
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got some balls on him.</v>

804
00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt about it.</v>

805
00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:19.160
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting that a guy takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>this much time off the sport and comes</v>

806
00:34:19.161 --> 00:34:23.180
<v Speaker 2>back from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes off of two tremendous beatings</v>

807
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.090
<v Speaker 2>against two of the very best in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>division.</v>

838
00:35:34.221 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 2>mirror both of those two together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you watch those two side by silent.</v>

00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:43.650
<v Speaker 1>losses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tall.</v>

841
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.560
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing it since he was 19 and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspended,</v>

842
00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:47.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

843
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he test?</v>

844
00:35:48.721 --> 00:35:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Positive for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same shit that,</v>

845
00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:58.840
<v Speaker 1>that stuff maybe melodion doubted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like some shit from Krypton.</v>

846
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:03.980
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't sound fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Melodious he,</v>

847
00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might have been taking some real</v>

848
00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:07.440
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

849
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean heavy weight.</v>

850
00:36:08.671 --> 00:36:10.920
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing taking that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

851
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.930
<v Speaker 1>probably just trying to keep his muscle</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass.</v>

852
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of guys that,</v>

853
00:36:15.601 --> 00:36:17.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially like late into their career,</v>

854
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:21.090
<v Speaker 1>they start developing real testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

855
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.210
<v Speaker 1>pituitary gland damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real common issue with older</v>

856
00:36:24.211 --> 00:36:28.620
<v Speaker 1>fighters as well with concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with football and professional fighters.</v>

857
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Because with head trauma it lowers your</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>

858
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Losie testosterone.</v>

859
00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Even if you look the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel the same.</v>

860
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.130
<v Speaker 1>You feel depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have low energy,</v>

861
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you keep most of the muscle mass</v>

862
00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:43.410
<v Speaker 1>or at least you look like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to tell.</v>

863
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy might weigh the same,</v>

864
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.840
<v Speaker 1>but now he might be 20 percent body fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of 10 or 15,</v>

865
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:55.440
<v Speaker 1>so five percent more body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But really the quality of his body,</v>

866
00:36:55.441 --> 00:36:57.300
<v Speaker 1>the way it moves away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not the same.</v>

867
00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the last thing to go is power and</v>

868
00:37:01.681 --> 00:37:04.210
<v Speaker 1>the speed and quickness the first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with heavyweight,</v>

869
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:05.670
<v Speaker 1>that's why you look at the heavyweight</v>
<v Speaker 1>division.</v>

870
00:37:05.671 --> 00:37:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's old man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still have all this power left.</v>

871
00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.140
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard with the heavy duty,</v>

872
00:37:10.141 --> 00:37:12.680
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to tell a guy like frank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should probably retirement.</v>

873
00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:16.560
<v Speaker 1>He was on our show awhile ago and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just coming off that loss and I was</v>

874
00:37:16.561 --> 00:37:17.400
<v Speaker 1>going to ask about retirement.</v>

875
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.990
<v Speaker 1>He was even thinking Nice Candle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

876
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.460
<v Speaker 1>what would I do that look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>division,</v>

877
00:37:20.461 --> 00:37:21.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's a whole.</v>

878
00:37:21.511 --> 00:37:23.370
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to argue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

879
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:25.260
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to argue because you</v>

880
00:37:25.261 --> 00:37:29.710
<v Speaker 1>look at guys like or Lawsky who oldest</v>

00:39:10.571 --> 00:39:12.100
<v Speaker 1>you certainly can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

926
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.250
<v Speaker 1>September 10th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC 203.</v>

927
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That two.</v>

928
00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:16.624
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two card.</v>

929
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of great cards coming up,</v>

930
00:39:20.101 --> 00:39:24.370
<v Speaker 1>but let's pull up the graphic Jamie for</v>
<v Speaker 1>or two for for 200.</v>

931
00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.480
<v Speaker 1>She almost said 100.</v>

932
00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.570
<v Speaker 1>You think it's the greatest card of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

933
00:39:29.571 --> 00:39:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

934
00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:33.920
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be.</v>

935
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:37.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean look what we got here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier</v>

936
00:39:37.371 --> 00:39:38.930
<v Speaker 1>is the main event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is an epic.</v>

937
00:39:38.931 --> 00:39:40.760
<v Speaker 1>God damn fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an epic fight.</v>

938
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Epic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a question for you joe.</v>

939
00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you could only watch one</v>

940
00:39:45.651 --> 00:39:47.570
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's either DC,</v>

941
00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:51.350
<v Speaker 1>John Jones or listener Mark Hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which gets more views.</v>

942
00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:54.080
<v Speaker 1>More views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Lesnar Hunt easy?</v>

943
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred percent because I was without</v>

944
00:39:57.231 --> 00:39:59.900
<v Speaker 1>lesbian on this card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing ain't breaking records,</v>

945
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:04.100
<v Speaker 1>but me personally I want to watch DC and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones.</v>

946
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Me Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very close second for the</v>

947
00:40:08.751 --> 00:40:12.050
<v Speaker 1>freak show factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lesnar hunts have very close second,</v>

948
00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:17.120
<v Speaker 1>but DC and Jones is my number one pick</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that card because I want to see how</v>

949
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:18.860
<v Speaker 1>DC figures out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

950
00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I think DC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he fought Jones the first time,</v>

951
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.380
<v Speaker 1>I think John Jones fucked him up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrestling.</v>

952
00:40:24.381 --> 00:40:27.290
<v Speaker 1>I think he didn't expect that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't expect John to be so big and</v>

953
00:40:27.291 --> 00:40:32.270
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think John outperformed out,</v>

954
00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.200
<v Speaker 1>outworked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat them.</v>

955
00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:37.770
<v Speaker 1>I think John just beat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think DC's a better fighter now.</v>

956
00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I think gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having gotten through rumble,</v>

957
00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:44.820
<v Speaker 1>having gone through Gustafson and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think dc</v>

958
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.330
<v Speaker 1>made some real good points about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

959
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:52.990
<v Speaker 1>how he would have performed versus how</v>
<v Speaker 1>osp would have performed in that fight.</v>

960
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:56.320
<v Speaker 1>And it might've been an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and I think he's coming into this</v>

961
00:40:56.321 --> 00:41:01.321
<v Speaker 1>fight much more confident and much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to handle the trash.</v>

962
00:41:01.571 --> 00:41:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Talking in the bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That first fight was super emotional,</v>

963
00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.560
<v Speaker 1>super emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting a little emotional now.</v>

964
00:41:08.561 --> 00:41:13.480
<v Speaker 1>You see Jon Jones get under the skin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't phase John and I love DC DC</v>

965
00:41:13.481 --> 00:41:14.920
<v Speaker 1>knows this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm way closer,</v>

966
00:41:14.921 --> 00:41:15.754
<v Speaker 1>decent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am done.</v>

967
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:20.620
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see what DC's going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>different and his age and his training</v>

968
00:41:20.621 --> 00:41:23.130
<v Speaker 1>camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he's going to do different to beat</v>

969
00:41:23.131 --> 00:41:24.700
<v Speaker 1>John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at leg reach.</v>

970
00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Jon's 45 inches DC zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use.</v>

971
00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:32.530
<v Speaker 1>How about you measure dcs legs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's at least get it up there.</v>

972
00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows that John</v>

973
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.280
<v Speaker 2>has an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just write zero inches fox,</v>

974
00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.920
<v Speaker 2>so just take out both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's running the fucking website?</v>

975
00:41:39.921 --> 00:41:42.620
<v Speaker 2>How hard is it to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I was Dana White,</v>

976
00:41:42.621 --> 00:41:45.920
<v Speaker 2>I'd be fucking details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be pulling my eyebrows out right</v>

977
00:41:45.921 --> 00:41:46.930
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go crazy.</v>

978
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:49.610
<v Speaker 2>The fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does it say zero?</v>

979
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.350
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>

980
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:54.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that intrigued with this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same way.</v>

981
00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:55.770
<v Speaker 2>So weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

982
00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I'll get shit for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the dominant Cruz.</v>

983
00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:00.860
<v Speaker 2>You at favorite did nothing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both those guys.</v>

984
00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:01.950
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

985
00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.520
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like I got to see this DC</v>
<v Speaker 2>John.</v>

986
00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:05.271
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

987
00:42:05.271 --> 00:42:06.870
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why John.</v>

988
00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you can help me with like with DC</v>
<v Speaker 2>John.</v>

989
00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:14.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm more interested to see the version</v>
<v Speaker 2>of John that comes out because that Osp</v>

990
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:18.100
<v Speaker 2>one was very safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John just getting through to get to DC.</v>

991
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:21.170
<v Speaker 2>I that first fight to me wasn't that</v>
<v Speaker 2>close,</v>

992
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:26.330
<v Speaker 2>and then DC has one style fighting one</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking stone and we've seen how that</v>

993
00:42:26.541 --> 00:42:27.980
<v Speaker 2>goes against John.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck,</v>

994
00:42:27.981 --> 00:42:30.650
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was close enough that I think it's</v>

995
00:42:30.651 --> 00:42:33.830
<v Speaker 2>intriguing because it was five rounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

996
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:36.280
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think dc lost the majority of the</v>

997
00:42:36.281 --> 00:42:38.360
<v Speaker 2>rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly lost a decision clearly,</v>

998
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:43.690
<v Speaker 2>but I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he pose enough problems giving the fact</v>

999
00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:47.150
<v Speaker 2>that I think that he was compromised</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally going into that fight.</v>

1000
00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:50.660
<v Speaker 2>I think he was overwhelmed and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's learned and gotten better since</v>

1001
00:42:50.661 --> 00:42:51.680
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm curious.</v>

1002
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1003
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.440
<v Speaker 2>if I was a betting man who I am a</v>
<v Speaker 2>betting man,</v>

1004
00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:02.540
<v Speaker 2>you would 100 percent put money on John</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jones when you money based on the first</v>

1005
00:43:02.541 --> 00:43:03.220
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1006
00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:04.730
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then also,</v>

1007
00:43:04.731 --> 00:43:08.540
<v Speaker 2>I think John needed that warmup fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think having a fight against a guy</v>

1008
00:43:08.541 --> 00:43:13.541
<v Speaker 2>like osp being off for 16 months and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then taking out a top six guy and Osp</v>

1009
00:43:14.061 --> 00:43:17.330
<v Speaker 2>was a dangerous motherfucker and beating</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and you know,</v>

1010
00:43:17.331 --> 00:43:18.350
<v Speaker 2>people say you didn't look good.</v>

1011
00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:19.760
<v Speaker 2>I just disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagree.</v>

1012
00:43:19.761 --> 00:43:22.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fought a tough guy onboard.</v>

1013
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:23.683
<v Speaker 2>Think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1014
00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.510
<v Speaker 2>I think he performed very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1015
00:43:26.511 --> 00:43:29.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my number one fight for sure.</v>

1016
00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:33.770
<v Speaker 2>But for the freak show factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lesner lesner hunts the freakiest freak</v>

1017
00:43:33.771 --> 00:43:35.750
<v Speaker 2>show of the freak shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

1018
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.890
<v Speaker 2>when they were talking years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were talking years ago about</v>

1019
00:43:39.891 --> 00:43:43.040
<v Speaker 2>Brock Lesnar coming back and Dana and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to have a conversation.</v>

1020
00:43:43.041 --> 00:43:45.240
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please mark on police.</v>

1021
00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you asked.</v>

1022
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:46.743
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was saying,</v>

1023
00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.120
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1024

<v Speaker 2>power wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1027
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:58.070
<v Speaker 2>That has a little bit of a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 2>striking a little,</v>

1028
00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.060
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1031

<v Speaker 2>like a fire hydrant.</v>

1032
00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's only like five,</v>

1033
00:44:05.661 --> 00:44:07.790
<v Speaker 2>nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's 265 pounds.</v>

1034
00:44:07.791 --> 00:44:12.791
<v Speaker 2>Got To cut weight to get down to 65.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hits like a fucking asteroidal</v>

1035
00:44:13.281 --> 00:44:14.840
<v Speaker 2>impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Straight up.</v>

1036
00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Pretty takes a shot as good as anybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ever lived.</v>

1037
00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:23.200
<v Speaker 2>He's got these legs that don't even look</v>
<v Speaker 2>real like his knees are like you took 13</v>

1038
00:44:23.211 --> 00:44:26.360
<v Speaker 2>knees and glued them together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look like to tortoise shell.</v>

1039

<v Speaker 2>He's just deck and not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not intimidated in the span of</v>

1042
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Brock Lesnar by anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing doesn't give a fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Brock Lesnar also zero inch leg reach.</v>

1045
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.890
<v Speaker 2>Measure his legs.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He did to me.</v>

1048
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:58.380
<v Speaker 2>So let's say worst case scenario for wwe</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fucking UFC.</v>

1049
00:44:58.381 --> 00:45:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Let's say brock Lesnar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes in there and it's like,</v>

1050
00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:01.030

1053
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.320
<v Speaker 2>So he gets merged in 30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is brock to psych?</v>

1054
00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:11.363
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's done.</v>

1056
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.221
<v Speaker 2>It's over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1057
00:45:14.221 --> 00:45:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would have three in a row.</v>

1058
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:19.710
<v Speaker 2>You got murked all three unless he just</v>
<v Speaker 2>decides like this is what I want to do</v>

1059
00:45:19.711 --> 00:45:21.900
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I only have like three or four years</v>

1060
00:45:21.901 --> 00:45:24.750
<v Speaker 2>left in my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did we say was 38?</v>

1061
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Is that we said Barack is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1062
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:32.160
<v Speaker 2>can't possibly have that much time left</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his body.</v>

1063
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.580
<v Speaker 2>If he wants to wrestle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can draw that picture is 38.</v>

1064
00:45:35.581 --> 00:45:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1065
00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:42.170
<v Speaker 2>So he's 38 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean realistically a natural 38 year</v>

1066
00:45:42.931 --> 00:45:45.690
<v Speaker 2>old athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not much time.</v>

1067
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.970
<v Speaker 2>There's not much time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>

1068
00:45:47.971 --> 00:45:49.920
<v Speaker 2>like I'm looking at my watch and about</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

1069
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:50.640
<v Speaker 2>seven hours.</v>

1070
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean unless you're a guy like Bernard</v>

1071
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Hopkins and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we using the word natural with air</v>

1072
00:45:56.881 --> 00:46:01.440
<v Speaker 2>quotes because boxing you can get away</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of shit and not get caught</v>

1073
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:03.330
<v Speaker 2>some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who the fuck knows?</v>

1074
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he.</v>

1075
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:07.710
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Sophie Beats Mark Hunt.</v>

1076
00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:11.880
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you get some down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking does is Brock Lesnar beat beats,</v>

1077
00:46:11.881 --> 00:46:16.881
<v Speaker 2>Mark Hunt and overeem beat Steve Bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They set it up.</v>

1078
00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:24.310
<v Speaker 2>God Brock Lesnar</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

1079
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:31.560
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine if the ratings would</v>
<v Speaker 2>go boom.</v>

1080
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:34.170
<v Speaker 2>And that's not something outside of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>realm of possibility?</v>

1081
00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neither one of those things.</v>

1082
00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.640
<v Speaker 2>Neither one of those things are outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>the realm of possibility.</v>

1083
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:42.680
<v Speaker 2>If steep a beats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if Steve Bay Beach Overeem,</v>

1084
00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.910
<v Speaker 2>I think you could still possibly make</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fight.</v>

1085
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:47.370
<v Speaker 2>I think you make steep a brock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1086
00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:48.120
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve.</v>

1087
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.170
<v Speaker 2>A beats over him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1088
00:46:49.171 --> 00:46:49.530
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1089
00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:53.430
<v Speaker 2>But if over and beat Steve Bates and</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural 100 percent overeem gets on and</v>

1090
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:55.770
<v Speaker 2>look at the difference in his body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked the same.</v>

1091
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:58.070
<v Speaker 2>He was on steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1092
00:46:58.290 --> 00:46:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Then you set that up and if brock shoots</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fucking power,</v>

1094
00:47:03.571 --> 00:47:08.571
<v Speaker 2>double on overeem pins him against the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cage and beats him into oblivion.</v>

1095
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The biggest star of all time.</v>

1096
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the fucking time and he becomes the</v>

1097
00:47:12.991 --> 00:47:14.550
<v Speaker 2>new heavyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then Cain,</v>

1098
00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:19.750
<v Speaker 2>he wants to fight cane again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I get some dealt with kings?</v>

1099
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Got To get through Travis Browne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what.</v>

1100
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.810
<v Speaker 2>He's a big favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cain is a tough motherfucker.</v>

1101
00:47:24.811 --> 00:47:26.550
<v Speaker 2>As tough as they get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>

1102
00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:31.580
<v Speaker 2>But you gotta think about the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>wear and tear on his body.</v>

1103
00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about knee operations,</v>

1104
00:47:35.261 --> 00:47:38.110
<v Speaker 2>shoulder operations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back operations.</v>

1105
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:43.120
<v Speaker 2>There is a ton of stuff that's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving out on canes body,</v>

1106
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:46.900
<v Speaker 2>so you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be concerned with whether or</v>

1107
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:50.560
<v Speaker 2>not he can make it through full camps</v>
<v Speaker 2>that anesthesia can't be good for you.</v>

1108
00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.920
<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not</v>

1109
00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:01.330
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He comes out with a big bubble ass what</v>

1110
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:05.020
<v Speaker 4>happened when I'm under,</v>
<v Speaker 4>might as well get it done so I don't</v>

1111
00:48:05.021 --> 00:48:08.210
<v Speaker 4>have to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cane decided to get a job,</v>

1112
00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:09.770
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to me,</v>

1113
00:48:09.771 --> 00:48:11.370
<v Speaker 4>this is my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1114
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:13.940
<v Speaker 4>if you're a betting man and you're like</v>
<v Speaker 4>draftkings or whatever.</v>

1115
00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:17.360
<v Speaker 4>This is my upset pick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Travis Browne is,</v>

1116
00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:19.730
<v Speaker 4>you're upset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pick here because keynes had so many</v>

1117
00:48:19.731 --> 00:48:21.320
<v Speaker 4>injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grantee went through a full camp with</v>

1118
00:48:21.321 --> 00:48:23.420
<v Speaker 4>DC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking tough fight,</v>

1119
00:48:23.421 --> 00:48:25.580
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Travis Travis hasn't looked great,</v>

1120
00:48:25.581 --> 00:48:26.750
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He poked in the eye,</v>

1121
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.270
<v Speaker 4>he beat me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got knocked the fuck out by Orlowski,</v>

1122
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:32.940
<v Speaker 4>but the fighting live poplars of monster</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1123
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.823
<v Speaker 4>He has A.</v>

1124
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned with his camp and the</v>

1125
00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:41.870
<v Speaker 2>amount of sparring partners he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>

1126
00:48:41.871 --> 00:48:45.220
<v Speaker 2>like he's not at Jackson's anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just a hotbed.</v>

1127
00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.410
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two schools of thought,</v>

1128
00:48:47.411 --> 00:48:48.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one school of thought,</v>

1129
00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:50.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's getting much more individual</v>

1130
00:48:50.951 --> 00:48:53.470
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got one guy concentrating on them</v>

1131
00:48:53.471 --> 00:48:55.780
<v Speaker 2>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's working as Mitzi already knows</v>

1132
00:48:55.781 --> 00:48:58.270
<v Speaker 2>how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just an opportunity for and he's</v>

1133
00:48:58.271 --> 00:49:02.260
<v Speaker 2>working with curriculum Dell who's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to help him tremendously with his</v>

1134
00:49:02.261 --> 00:49:02.981
<v Speaker 2>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rick,</v>

1135
00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:05.110
<v Speaker 2>he's a fantastic grappling in vegas</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

1136
00:49:05.111 --> 00:49:06.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Vicky?</v>

1137
00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I think ricky was working with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>

1138
00:49:08.231 --> 00:49:10.570
<v Speaker 2>He's been working with it for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if he's full time.</v>

1139
00:49:10.571 --> 00:49:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's going back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either way.</v>

1140
00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Rick is one of the best in the business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fantastic.</v>

1141
00:49:14.021 --> 00:49:15.730
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart guy too,</v>

1142
00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:19.510
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to find out and I will find</v>

1143
00:49:19.511 --> 00:49:23.110
<v Speaker 2>out this week what kind of training he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting in his camp.</v>

1144
00:49:23.111 --> 00:49:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Who is working with that makes a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference with the garlic travis,</v>

1145
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:27.820
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're fighting a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1146
00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.580
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder why travis moved away from</v>

1147
00:49:30.581 --> 00:49:33.820
<v Speaker 2>Jackson's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Felt like that was such a great camp.</v>

1148
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.760
<v Speaker 2>What do you think what it was his face?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

1149
00:49:36.761 --> 00:49:38.380
<v Speaker 2>You wonder why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1150
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1151
00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:40.683
<v Speaker 2>Do you</v>

1152
00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:41.411
<v Speaker 4>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1153
00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:43.050

1187
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:57.710
<v Speaker 2>Those are things that are real hard to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back from something you're not</v>

1188
00:50:57.711 --> 00:50:59.060
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a broken hand,</v>

1189
00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:01.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not talking about like snaps his</v>

1190
00:51:01.251 --> 00:51:04.190
<v Speaker 2>forearm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about like critical</v>

1191
00:51:04.191 --> 00:51:06.260
<v Speaker 2>points of pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1192
00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Credit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>critical stress points,</v>

1193
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:09.620
<v Speaker 2>shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knees,</v>

1194
00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.080
<v Speaker 2>back when those things start going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1195
00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:14.120
<v Speaker 2>as a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's those.</v>

1196
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:17.090
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how much time is he had to truly</v>

1197
00:51:17.091 --> 00:51:17.540
<v Speaker 2>rehab it.</v>

1198
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Like we've seen pictures of his body</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it was just a few months ago and</v>

1199
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:23.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite honestly didn't look good</v>

1200
00:51:23.001 --> 00:51:24.530
<v Speaker 2>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's never looked good,</v>

1201
00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.980
<v Speaker 2>but he looked worse than he usually</v>
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

1202
00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.200
<v Speaker 2>He's been steady on the burritos and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>just that,</v>

1203
00:51:30.201 --> 00:51:34.880
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like muscularly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't look like he was built up the</v>

1204
00:51:34.881 --> 00:51:35.701
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1205
00:51:35.701 --> 00:51:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not look good.</v>

1206
00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.580
<v Speaker 2>He's not the Quito Kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1207
00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:45.170
<v Speaker 2>if there's a time for Travis to ever get</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cain Velasquez and now's the time now</v>

1208
00:51:45.171 --> 00:51:46.790
<v Speaker 2>and remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a three round fight.</v>

1209
00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:48.350
<v Speaker 2>If it's five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1210
00:51:48.351 --> 00:51:52.580
<v Speaker 2>he taken you swimming sun into the deep</v>
<v Speaker 2>waters and it's fucking miserable as dos</v>

1211
00:51:52.581 --> 00:51:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Santos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking.</v>

1212
00:51:53.451 --> 00:51:54.650
<v Speaker 2>Never been saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1213
00:51:54.651 --> 00:51:57.170
<v Speaker 2>three rounds with game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your Cardio's nice,</v>

1214
00:51:57.171 --> 00:51:59.270
<v Speaker 2>then you can deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get through it,</v>

1215
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.220
<v Speaker 2>but five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to fucking break you.</v>

1216
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:02.450
<v Speaker 2>But is it the same kane?</v>

1217
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:05.720
<v Speaker 2>And if it is the same Kane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if cane comes back and he's 100 percent</v>

1218
00:52:05.721 --> 00:52:08.300
<v Speaker 2>healthy and he's making that mad run</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards that title,</v>

1219
00:52:08.301 --> 00:52:10.670
<v Speaker 2>belting it's easy fight for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes very interesting.</v>

1220
00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're talking about a different</v>

1221
00:52:12.381 --> 00:52:13.580
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cain,</v>

1222
00:52:13.581 --> 00:52:14.840
<v Speaker 2>Cain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cain,</v>

1223
00:52:14.841 --> 00:52:17.930
<v Speaker 2>cain in his prime cane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like second fight with junior dos</v>

1224
00:52:17.931 --> 00:52:20.420
<v Speaker 2>Santos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ben Rothwell fight like some of the</v>

1225
00:52:20.421 --> 00:52:22.160
<v Speaker 2>other fights that he had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's a monster.</v>

1226
00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:23.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still maintain.</v>

1227
00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:28.970
<v Speaker 2>It's really between him and fader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's between him and a prime time pride</v>

1228
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.040
<v Speaker 2>fader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people go with prime time</v>

1229
00:52:31.041 --> 00:52:33.180
<v Speaker 2>pride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fate or now you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>for doom in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you certainly do.</v>

1231

<v Speaker 2>He also beat King.</v>

1232
00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he beat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he beat fade or he beat Cain.</v>

1234
00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.970
<v Speaker 2>He submitted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1236
00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:50.473
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1237
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>

1238
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:52.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1239
00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.100
<v Speaker 2>it's funny how if he never fought steep</v>
<v Speaker 2>bay,</v>

1240
00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:58.970
<v Speaker 2>you would say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Verdugo has emerged as one of the</v>

1241
00:52:58.971 --> 00:53:01.970
<v Speaker 2>greatest heavyweights of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he makes us mad.</v>

1242
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Run at steep a like charges Adam.</v>

1243
00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:08.970
<v Speaker 2>That's that emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy steep.</v>

1244
00:53:08.971 --> 00:53:10.680
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold up what debate is,</v>

1245
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:13.350
<v Speaker 2>but what a beautiful sun the firehouse</v>
<v Speaker 2>son</v>

1246
00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:19.700
<v Speaker 2>enjoy Brazil</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the way he hit a moving away,</v>

1247
00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.680
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do it?</v>

1248
00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:25.890
<v Speaker 2>But boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're coming into my shot.</v>

1249
00:53:25.891 --> 00:53:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1250
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:27.750
<v Speaker 4>it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1251
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.630
<v Speaker 4>how about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Misha Tate Amended Nunez?</v>

1252
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:33.930
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a very interesting fight.</v>

1253
00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:37.440
<v Speaker 4>My think about Nunez,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my concern is her cardio,</v>

1254
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:40.350
<v Speaker 4>she comes out like a Bat Outta hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She'd certainly does.</v>

1255
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:45.440
<v Speaker 4>And she's danger Russ as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But misha tate is as game as they come.</v>

1256
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.680
<v Speaker 4>You know what the problem is though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mischa's a slow starter,</v>

1257
00:53:49.681 --> 00:53:51.750
<v Speaker 4>like she always gets in trouble and</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes back.</v>

1258
00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:55.770
<v Speaker 4>But with Nunez she hits so fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're a slow starter that first</v>

1259
00:53:55.771 --> 00:53:58.380
<v Speaker 4>round you're going to have to weatherman</v>
<v Speaker 4>by that first round.</v>

1260
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:01.450
<v Speaker 4>Tate wins and honestly for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I know people hate on it,</v>

1261
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:04.380
<v Speaker 4>but for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the business tastes so good for the</v>

1262
00:54:04.381 --> 00:54:05.540
<v Speaker 4>sport man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because she.</v>

1263
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:08.070
<v Speaker 4>She looks fucking obviously she's</v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful.</v>

1264
00:54:08.071 --> 00:54:10.470
<v Speaker 4>She speaks great and she's just a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>winter.</v>

1265
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:12.030
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's articulate.</v>

1266
00:54:12.031 --> 00:54:13.830
<v Speaker 4>She's just a good winner no doubt.</v>

1267
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:16.800
<v Speaker 4>But for Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a huge market,</v>

1268
00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:19.800
<v Speaker 4>Amanda Nunez will be Gi.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Prelim said ib both you bitches.</v>

1281
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:46.703
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1282
00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.860
<v Speaker 4>if you look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she has fights like she has shown</v>

1283
00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:53.220
<v Speaker 4>remarkable ability to endure punches and</v>
<v Speaker 4>kicks.</v>

1284
00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.800
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever see her fight with Julia</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kedsey in strikeforce?</v>

1285
00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:58.860
<v Speaker 4>Julie Kenzie can fucking kick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1286
00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.440
<v Speaker 4>She's got some beautiful kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful technique.</v>

1287
00:55:01.441 --> 00:55:06.441
<v Speaker 4>And she caught me with a fucking cloying</v>
<v Speaker 4>or right on the chin and a meesha fought</v>

1288
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.360
<v Speaker 4>it off and gutted it out and eventually</v>
<v Speaker 4>got a submission,</v>

1289
00:55:09.361 --> 00:55:10.290
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>

1290
00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.940
<v Speaker 4>you're not fighting off the Nunez.</v>

1291
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.760
<v Speaker 4>Straight Punch to the face though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She hits so fucking hard.</v>

1292
00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:16.600
<v Speaker 4>She gets so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that would be troubled,</v>

1293
00:55:16.601 --> 00:55:17.490
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But do you think she,</v>

1294
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:20.700
<v Speaker 4>she punches his heart as Julie Kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say no fucking way.</v>

1295
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:21.830
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever see that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Five,</v>

1296
00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:22.920
<v Speaker 4>five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's true.</v>

1297
00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:26.240
<v Speaker 4>That's after Ronda beat her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then that was her next fight.</v>

1298
00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:27.450
<v Speaker 4>Somebody put up a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1299
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:32.510
<v Speaker 4>a highlight clip the other day of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>Julie Kenzie's kicks versus Misha Tate</v>

1300
00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:35.460
<v Speaker 4>cv could pull that up just where you go</v>
<v Speaker 4>wash your skin,</v>

1301
00:55:35.461 --> 00:55:37.380
<v Speaker 4>blasted in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's this one,</v>

1302
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:39.540
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she got blasted a couple of times with</v>

1303
00:55:39.541 --> 00:55:40.650
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good kicks,</v>

1304
00:55:40.651 --> 00:55:43.110
<v Speaker 4>like she hit it with a good front leg</v>
<v Speaker 4>side kick,</v>

1305
00:55:43.111 --> 00:55:46.660
<v Speaker 4>like I'm not totally sideways but like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thai style to the,</v>

1306
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:51.330
<v Speaker 4>to the chest center flying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there was this one high kick that</v>

1307
00:55:51.331 --> 00:55:54.390
<v Speaker 4>she caught her just perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says just,</v>

1308
00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.720
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting because you see her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's so soft spoken.</v>

1309
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:59.520
<v Speaker 4>She's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1310
00:55:59.521 --> 00:56:00.980
<v Speaker 4>you just wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does.</v>

1311
00:56:00.981 --> 00:56:03.930
<v Speaker 4>There's no indications of how mentally</v>
<v Speaker 4>tough she is.</v>

1312
00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:07.960
<v Speaker 4>She is tough as they come off as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>beast.</v>

1313
00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:09.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1314
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.370
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I was looking at this,</v>

1315
00:56:11.371 --> 00:56:11.821
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

1316
00:56:11.821 --> 00:56:13.830

<v Speaker 4>I looked up a b,</v>

1317
00:56:13.831 --> 00:56:17.520
<v Speaker 4>both of them and stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Both of them are cats of monster cats.</v>

1318
00:56:17.521 --> 00:56:19.440
<v Speaker 4>Ferocious who camp.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the back and she's like,</v>

1322
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:30.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking about moving and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to her in the same camp.</v>

1323
00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.170
<v Speaker 4>I tore some cat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're already thinking that it's</v>

1324
00:56:32.171 --> 00:56:35.140
<v Speaker 4>time to go because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in this routine here,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you have all this negative energy here,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You start a new chapter.</v>

1329
00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:50.560
<v Speaker 4>It'll be like Eric del Fierro is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>unsung hero in mma.</v>

1330
00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:54.580

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:57.520
<v Speaker 4>in mma who were like elite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>top of the food chain,</v>

1332
00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:02.000
<v Speaker 4>world class coaches that don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>necessarily get the spotlight that they</v>

1333
00:57:02.010 --> 00:57:04.870
<v Speaker 4>deserve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also dominick Cruz who's been</v>

1334
00:57:04.871 --> 00:57:08.590
<v Speaker 4>helping cat quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you find a video dude?</v>

1335
00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:10.900
<v Speaker 4>How about just the kicks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found the fight a few times,</v>

1336
00:57:10.901 --> 00:57:13.770
<v Speaker 4>but not had the last round.</v>

1342
00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:27.400
<v Speaker 4>I see Dominic Cruz in the corner hyping</v>
<v Speaker 4>himself up debts here.</v>

1343
00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:29.170

<v Speaker 4>They don't want you to win.</v>

1344
00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.570
<v Speaker 4>They don't want you to win this.</v>

1345
00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.040
<v Speaker 4>He's talking to himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the guy who works there,</v>

1350
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:40.630

<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1351
00:57:40.631 --> 00:57:41.770
<v Speaker 4>They set up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1352
00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:44.150
<v Speaker 4>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I went,</v>

1353

<v Speaker 4>that's why he's world champ.</v>

1354
00:57:47.081 --> 00:57:51.040
<v Speaker 4>I tell Dick Jokes and work at Costco</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we think this is a game.</v>

1355
00:57:51.041 --> 00:57:55.780
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't brother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One second.</v>

1356

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's hilarious.</v>

1357
00:57:57.490 --> 00:57:59.270
<v Speaker 4>They don't want you to win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like curious.</v>

1358
00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:00.930
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1359
00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:05.440
<v Speaker 4>but restart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Restart that could watch this.</v>

1360
00:58:05.441 --> 00:58:06.970
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the sidekick.</v>

1361
00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:08.980
<v Speaker 4>Well that was no power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1362
00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:11.800
<v Speaker 4>but wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's the sidekick to the chest.</v>

1363
00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:13.810
<v Speaker 4>See how she's got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like sort of Thai style.</v>

1364
00:58:13.811 --> 00:58:17.350
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like a butt sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This leg kick.</v>

1365
00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:19.180
<v Speaker 4>Very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But now here it comes.</v>

1366
00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 4>Here's the clanger.</v>

1367
00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:24.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

1368
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:28.810
<v Speaker 4>How many people survived that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a calling or a clanger to the</v>

1369
00:58:28.811 --> 00:58:32.440
<v Speaker 4>mug and Julie Carter with a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to think that not only did she</v>

1370
00:58:32.441 --> 00:58:36.250
<v Speaker 4>survive this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she went on to win by submission.</v>

1371
00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.170
<v Speaker 4>That's a woman's bat to the face</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically.</v>

1372
00:58:38.171 --> 00:58:40.840
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is just amazing.</v>

1373
00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:44.770
<v Speaker 4>Now Meesha,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's as good as they come in for her to</v>

1374
00:58:44.771 --> 00:58:46.300
<v Speaker 4>keep one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so good for,</v>

1375
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:47.930
<v Speaker 4>for the women's division.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1376
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:51.880
<v Speaker 4>It's so fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well really the rematch with her and</v>

1377
00:58:51.881 --> 00:58:55.690
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda is the fucking fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the fight.</v>

1378
00:58:55.691 --> 00:58:58.960
<v Speaker 4>And even more so than holly and Ronda</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they,</v>

1379
00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:01.720
<v Speaker 4>there's so much animosity might</v>
<v Speaker 4>disagree.</v>

1380
00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:04.360
<v Speaker 4>Well because me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she just choked Talia unconscious.</v>

1381
00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:08.450
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think that that,</v>

1382
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:12.400
<v Speaker 4>that Holly Rhonda rematch is way bigger</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we've never seen Ronnie just get</v>

1383
00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:15.340
<v Speaker 4>fucking Mert and dismantling that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>

1384
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:17.710
<v Speaker 4>And now she and she was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>suicide and she's been out of the</v>

1385
00:59:17.711 --> 00:59:20.260
<v Speaker 4>spotlight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She came back and now she's facing that</v>

1386
00:59:20.261 --> 00:59:21.290
<v Speaker 4>same flow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1387
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:22.540
<v Speaker 4>oh fuck.</v>

1388
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.590
<v Speaker 1>And she beats her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1389
00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Or She just never comes back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't know.</v>

1390
00:59:27.381 --> 00:59:29.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean she just got through knee</v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>

1391
00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:32.320
<v Speaker 1>So that's always an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1392
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:33.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long,</v>

1393
00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.590
<v Speaker 1>what's the extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extent of the damage,</v>

1394
00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:40.130
<v Speaker 1>like what did she get taken care of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe she had meniscus issues,</v>

1395
00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:41.960
<v Speaker 1>which is not the worst thing in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1396
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:43.880
<v Speaker 1>The best of all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1397
00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Well especially if you can get stem cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>shots in there,</v>

1398
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:49.750
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure she probably did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1399
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.590
<v Speaker 1>so there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1400
00:59:51.591 --> 00:59:53.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe she comes back and maybe she's got</v>

1401
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:57.590
<v Speaker 1>more mobility and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more agility than ever because of taking</v>

1402
00:59:57.591 --> 00:59:59.180
<v Speaker 1>care of an issue that's been bothering</v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

1403
00:59:59.181 --> 01:00:01.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this as much as anybody bothering her</v>

1404
01:00:01.041 --> 01:00:02.690
<v Speaker 1>for years maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

1405
01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just doesn't give a fuck about</v>

1406
01:00:03.921 --> 01:00:04.611
<v Speaker 1>fighting him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1407
01:00:04.611 --> 01:00:05.330
<v Speaker 1>there's that too.</v>

1408
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:07.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you lose in such a devastating</v>

1409
01:00:07.401 --> 01:00:11.540
<v Speaker 1>fashion like that and then take a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time off of it mean she without a doubt</v>

1410
01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:16.541
<v Speaker 1>has a warrior and a winner's mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for how long,</v>

1411
01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>she still want to do it that she.</v>

1413
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Did she want to jump right back in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>

1414
01:00:22.221 --> 01:00:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Holly wanted to jump right back in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm always weird comment,</v>

1416
01:00:26.550 --> 01:00:28.880
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that was a little strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>was</v>

1417
01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:35.240
<v Speaker 1>as the face of women's MMA and you lose</v>
<v Speaker 1>one fight and saying how you had</v>

1418
01:00:35.241 --> 01:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>suicidal thoughts and talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be a do nothing bitch,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1420
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as it doesn't go your way,</v>

1421
01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:44.840

01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:29.790

01:04:07.321 --> 01:04:09.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kidding.</v>

1512
01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:11.310
<v Speaker 1>That's not bad either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1513
01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.000
<v Speaker 1>the thing is like girls who do those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1514
01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:16.860
<v Speaker 1>those figure competitions cut all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1515
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Buddy's girlfriend did that and my</v>

1516
01:04:19.861 --> 01:04:21.540
<v Speaker 1>brother's wife did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never,</v>

1517
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:26.040
<v Speaker 1>they never go back to the same man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't like their thyroid.</v>

1518
01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Everything's all fucked up on them</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they lose all this weight.</v>

1519
01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the body was in.</v>

1520
01:04:30.631 --> 01:04:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Their hormones are all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a nightmare,</v>

1521
01:04:32.731 --> 01:04:34.860
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To get down that low.</v>

1522
01:04:34.861 --> 01:04:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Your body's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

1523
01:04:35.971 --> 01:04:37.290

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1524
01:04:37.291 --> 01:04:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Because body fats are usually higher for</v>
<v Speaker 1>women than there are for men,</v>

1525
01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:42.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's got to be the same for men too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys.</v>

1526
01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Bodybuilders and they get down to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>shredded three percent.</v>

1527
01:04:45.421 --> 01:04:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see everything.</v>

1528

<v Speaker 1>Strike patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're doing it just for other</v>

1593
01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.770
<v Speaker 4>Cocaine and bad life decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1594
01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:51.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how old is Sean Claude Van Damme?</v>

1595
01:07:51.311 --> 01:07:55.000
<v Speaker 4>Let's take a guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say 55.</v>

1596
01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.820
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll say God damn,</v>

1597
01:07:57.821 --> 01:08:00.880
<v Speaker 4>if he's 50 he likes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's the most shot out.</v>

1598
01:08:00.881 --> 01:08:02.460
<v Speaker 4>Fifty five year old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna.</v>

1599
01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:03.820
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say 58.</v>

1600
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.410
<v Speaker 4>Fifty 5:00 AM,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1601
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:06.740
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

1602
01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:11.860
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because Tom Cruise is probably like 52</v>

1603
01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:15.230
<v Speaker 4>and Tom Cruise looks sensation or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you're talking about</v>

1604
01:08:15.231 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 4>scientology,</v>

1605
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:17.330
<v Speaker 2>she didn't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're helping them.</v>

1606
01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Hydrated judges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just rub it in there.</v>

1607
01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's 54 for the same age,</v>

1608
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:28.670
<v Speaker 2>they're the same age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one year difference.</v>

1609
01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:32.840
<v Speaker 2>And look how fucking stunning this dime</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece is killing the game.</v>

1610
01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:34.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a big difference there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1611
01:08:34.641 --> 01:08:37.220
<v Speaker 2>That is a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's also never been hit in the face</v>

1612
01:08:37.221 --> 01:08:38.210
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1613
01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.440
<v Speaker 2>But neither is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Claude van Damme.</v>

1614
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:42.470
<v Speaker 2>So dear you sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a kickboxing record.</v>

1615
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.333
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does not.</v>

1616
01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Point karate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fighting backgrounds and kickboxing.</v>

1617
01:08:47.730 --> 01:08:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy it.</v>

1618
01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.850
<v Speaker 2>How do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1619
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.100
<v Speaker 2>I think he might've fought some point</v>
<v Speaker 2>karate tournaments.</v>

1620
01:08:55.101 --> 01:08:56.870
<v Speaker 2>I really don't think he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kicked boxed.</v>

1621
01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:59.960
<v Speaker 2>You think you just mark them if you guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>owe me and him?</v>

1622
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what are we do when we do an MMA?</v>

1623
01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Are we doing straight up fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1624
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.520
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing.</v>

1625
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he has any power.</v>

1626
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Eighteen and one that's not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

1627
01:09:11.330 --> 01:09:13.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

1628
01:09:13.931 --> 01:09:18.380
<v Speaker 2>There's a fought on tape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See this as a karate fight,</v>

1629
01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:20.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is this a kickboxing fight?</v>

1630
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:23.060
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen,</v>

1631
01:09:23.061 --> 01:09:24.950
<v Speaker 2>79.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fight on tape.</v>

1632
01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Let's say caught on tape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1633
01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.830
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>

1634
01:09:30.831 --> 01:09:34.040
<v Speaker 2>This is point fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck fuckers fluid though.</v>

1635
01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was just got tagged gold.</v>

1636
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You always holding the trophy.</v>

1637
01:09:39.651 --> 01:09:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look,</v>

1638
01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:45.940
<v Speaker 2>he most likely had some form of</v>
<v Speaker 2>competition experience,</v>

1639
01:09:46.761 --> 01:09:49.460
<v Speaker 2>but was he 18 and one in kickboxing for</v>
<v Speaker 2>real?</v>

1640
01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:54.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eighteen one means you got to fight for</v>

1641
01:09:54.651 --> 01:09:55.310
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1642
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:57.830
<v Speaker 2>most people don't have more than four</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights in a year.</v>

1643
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:59.990
<v Speaker 2>So you're fighting for a long period of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1644
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Did that say pro?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1645
01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:05.740
<v Speaker 2>just said 18 and one kick because back</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it could be an amateur because you</v>

1646
01:10:05.741 --> 01:10:07.770
<v Speaker 2>know smokers are just blowing through</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1647
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:08.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1648
01:10:08.511 --> 01:10:10.710
<v Speaker 2>it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I believe that I want to</v>

1649
01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.600
<v Speaker 2>believe it because he's one of my hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No doubt the guy had some pretty kicks,</v>

1650
01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:19.670
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with the way he kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like got like point kicks.</v>

1651
01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Like flippy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1652
01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:22.730
<v Speaker 2>They're like flipkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flipkey kicks,</v>

1653
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:27.290
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing and full contact karate</v>
<v Speaker 2>career began to fullcontact current 77.</v>

1654
01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:29.450
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventy seven.</v>

1655
01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:32.630
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would mean he would be like,</v>

1656
01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.180
<v Speaker 2>how old was he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like 18.</v>

1657
01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little bullshit.</v>

1658
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:45.200
<v Speaker 2>Eighteen knockouts and one defeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was even named Mr Belgium in a</v>

1659
01:10:45.201 --> 01:10:48.290
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilding competition in the game.</v>

1660
01:10:53.710 --> 01:10:57.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe here's the guy winning just since</v>

1661
01:10:57.411 --> 01:11:00.500
<v Speaker 2>2009 v Van Dams in planning to make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>comeback,</v>

1662
01:11:00.501 --> 01:11:04.610
<v Speaker 2>fight to fight former box Olympic gold</v>
<v Speaker 2>medalists.</v>

1663
01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.530
<v Speaker 2>Some luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cam Singh,</v>

1664
01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:10.760
<v Speaker 2>who is a tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm boxing champion.</v>

1665
01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:15.000
<v Speaker 2>The fight was a focal point of the ITV</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality show.</v>

1666
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.880
<v Speaker 2>John Claude van Damme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind closed doors.</v>

1667
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:23.030
<v Speaker 2>The fight has been repeatedly postpone</v>
<v Speaker 2>which many critics doubting it will</v>

1668
01:11:24.121 --> 01:11:25.340
<v Speaker 2>occur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they would doubt at</v>

1669
01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:28.930
<v Speaker 2>this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially to reach out to the gym.</v>

1670
01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.070
<v Speaker 2>The difficulty of booking the venue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1671
01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:34.980
<v Speaker 2>because that's hard.</v>

<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>

1674
01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:41.910
<v Speaker 2>In December 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Van Damme was seen as a part of Cam</v>

1682

<v Speaker 2>of kickboxing organizations that one of</v>

1683
01:12:15.061 --> 01:12:18.600

<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of world championship</v>

1687
01:12:27.661 --> 01:12:30.870

<v Speaker 2>collaboration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do a kickboxer</v>

1692
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.630
<v Speaker 2>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have the fighter and the</v>

<v Speaker 2>world champion and we don't really have.</v>

1695
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:49.900
<v Speaker 2>It's not like the WBC for boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1696
01:12:49.901 --> 01:12:52.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not lifted the UFC for mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like my.</v>

1701
01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.960
<v Speaker 2>It's not like Bella tour calls their</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

01:13:05.961 --> 01:13:10.020
<v Speaker 2>the world champion like Bella tour world</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say Bella Tor champion,</v>

1708
01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:26.880
<v Speaker 2>but when you say world title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Beltour world title,</v>

1709
01:13:26.881 --> 01:13:29.250
<v Speaker 2>it's not the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but stop please.</v>

1710
01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.620
<v Speaker 2>But that's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>

1711
01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:34.190
<v Speaker 2>That's why like in the Mba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the calves or the world champ,</v>

1712
01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:37.230

<v Speaker 2>being those five guys.</v>

1713
01:13:37.231 --> 01:13:38.210
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Higher world.</v>

1714
01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:41.730
<v Speaker 2>That's NFL,</v>
<v Speaker 2>NBA world champions boxing,</v>

1715
01:13:41.731 --> 01:13:43.410
<v Speaker 2>mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's all this</v>

01:13:45.010 --> 01:13:48.420
<v Speaker 2>chick is the world heavyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

1717
01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who else has the claim?</v>

1718
01:13:52.230 --> 01:13:55.290
<v Speaker 2>Best heavyweight MMA fighters in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world or in the UFC?</v>

1719
01:13:55.291 --> 01:13:57.840
<v Speaker 2>No doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Bay's the best of the best.</v>

1720
01:13:57.841 --> 01:14:00.150
<v Speaker 2>He knocked out for doom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the world heavyweight champ.</v>

1721
01:14:00.151 --> 01:14:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the only belt that really count.</v>

1722
01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:04.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the UFC belt really counts.</v>

1723
01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:09.090
<v Speaker 2>The only way the UFC belt is even in</v>
<v Speaker 2>contention is in some of the lighter</v>

1724
01:14:09.091 --> 01:14:12.580
<v Speaker 2>weight classes you start going like home</v>
<v Speaker 2>would happen if this guy fought that guy</v>

1725
01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:14.470
<v Speaker 2>who I disagreed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not even.</v>

1726
01:14:14.471 --> 01:14:16.390
<v Speaker 2>They're not even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even that really.</v>

1727
01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:20.500
<v Speaker 2>That's the only place I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Marlon Moraes is a very talented</v>

1728
01:14:20.501 --> 01:14:21.370
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1729
01:14:21.371 --> 01:14:25.190
<v Speaker 2>He's a 1:45 or right at 1:35.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One 45 or write my own Mirage,</v>

1730
01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:28.030
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fights for a world series of</v>

1731
01:14:28.031 --> 01:14:31.210
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a legit like world class fighter.</v>

1732
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:33.970
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is why the UFC,</v>

1733
01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:39.020
<v Speaker 2>it really only is the belt that counts</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if he fought in the UFC you</v>

1734
01:14:39.221 --> 01:14:40.390
<v Speaker 2>ain't going straight to the bell.</v>

1735
01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:44.950
<v Speaker 2>You going through the fucking ringer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's who at 45 to get to that belt.</v>

1736
01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:48.500
<v Speaker 2>Which everyone did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which Alvarez did to memorize a.</v>

1737
01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:49.840
<v Speaker 2>was he 1:35?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1738
01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.440
<v Speaker 2>So he's a bantamweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate threat to,</v>

1739
01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:56.290
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody in the UFC at 1:35.</v>

1740
01:14:56.650 --> 01:14:59.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could he really hit Dominic Cruz?</v>

1741
01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:01.390
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look at that guy.</v>

1742
01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:05.320
<v Speaker 2>That guy is a savage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a legit world class fighter.</v>

1743
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Skeptical hybels on that buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

1744
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:11.890
<v Speaker 2>He is bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's super talented.</v>

1745
01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:14.190
<v Speaker 2>But unless you're in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one gives a.</v>

1746
01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:17.260
<v Speaker 2>nobody gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird because you know,</v>

1747
01:15:17.261 --> 01:15:20.080
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the few guys outside the UFC</v>

1748
01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:22.780
<v Speaker 2>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just engages in other one.</v>

1749
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:26.440
<v Speaker 2>If you guys outside the UFC where I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see that fucking guy fight the</v>

1750
01:15:26.441 --> 01:15:27.820
<v Speaker 2>best of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1751
01:15:27.821 --> 01:15:30.250
<v Speaker 2>I see like real mad potential and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>

1752
01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:31.350
<v Speaker 2>he's another one.</v>

1753
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:34.720
<v Speaker 2>He's the world series of fighting 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>slash 55 champion.</v>

1754
01:15:34.721 --> 01:15:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an animal.</v>

1755
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:37.360
<v Speaker 2>Kid's a fucking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a beast.</v>

1756
01:15:37.361 --> 01:15:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started with us in Denver was a</v>

1757
01:15:39.071 --> 01:15:39.790
<v Speaker 2>restroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1758
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:41.680
<v Speaker 2>UNC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just a monster.</v>

1759
01:15:41.681 --> 01:15:44.200
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the guys he's beating for</v>

1760
01:15:44.201 --> 01:15:45.760
<v Speaker 2>these title 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

1761
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:46.690
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1762
01:15:46.691 --> 01:15:49.360
<v Speaker 2>no debate whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there ain't any growing either in</v>

1763
01:15:49.361 --> 01:15:51.340
<v Speaker 2>the UFC know because you come from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>world champ.</v>

1764
01:15:51.341 --> 01:15:53.320
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at will Brooke's first fight bras.</v>

1765
01:15:53.321 --> 01:15:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Pearson?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1766
01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:55.630
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1767
01:15:55.631 --> 01:15:57.310
<v Speaker 2>He's going right into the hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

1768
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:59.470
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the nature of the beast with UFC,</v>

1769
01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:01.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no different than the NBA or nfl.</v>

1770
01:16:01.821 --> 01:16:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no easy.</v>

1771
01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:05.530
<v Speaker 2>You're not getting cakewalks and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have this contract.</v>

1772
01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:07.760
<v Speaker 2>They're paying a shitload of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1773
01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:11.650
<v Speaker 2>so there can be no doubt that the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 2>1:35 pounds a month,</v>

1774
01:16:11.651 --> 01:16:13.810
<v Speaker 2>55 champions are the champions of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1775
01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:16.960
<v Speaker 2>but there is talent in some other way</v>
<v Speaker 2>classes.</v>

1776
01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:19.210
<v Speaker 2>There's talent in some other</v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations.</v>

1777
01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:22.030
<v Speaker 2>We'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>get Eddie Alvarez.</v>

1778
01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:23.681
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1779
01:16:23.681 --> 01:16:26.320
<v Speaker 2>I want how you doing the UFC world title</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1780
01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:30.670
<v Speaker 2>He'd be the first guy with a belt or</v>
<v Speaker 2>title in UFC title and I think Chandler,</v>

1781
01:16:30.671 --> 01:16:32.800
<v Speaker 2>a guy beat him once and lost him second</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1782
01:16:32.801 --> 01:16:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I think Chandler looks even better now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Better than ever.</v>

1783
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:37.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean to be knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but tricky.</v>

1784
01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Pippa like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good Lord,</v>

1785
01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.840
<v Speaker 2>he's explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so quick with his entries and exit.</v>

1786
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:46.870
<v Speaker 2>His footwork was fantastic and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who was doing some pretty extensive</v>

1787
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:52.830
<v Speaker 2>fucking camps to get ready for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular workout ethic or work ethic.</v>

1788
01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a guy like a guy like chandler</v>

1789
01:16:57.341 --> 01:16:58.660
<v Speaker 2>who's just killing the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1790
01:16:58.670 --> 01:17:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Like he has a shitload of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is the thing though.</v>

1791
01:17:03.071 --> 01:17:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you're his.</v>

1792
01:17:04.230 --> 01:17:05.620
<v Speaker 2>His manager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the.</v>

1793
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:09.770
<v Speaker 2>He's the king of Bela tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say he's pulling in small and six</v>

1794
01:17:09.771 --> 01:17:10.130
<v Speaker 2>figures</v>

1795
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:13.100
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sponsorship money included so high six</v>

1796
01:17:13.101 --> 01:17:15.950
<v Speaker 4>figures or per fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they come to the UFC strips.</v>

1797
01:17:16.050 --> 01:17:17.810
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be a different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1798
01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:20.840
<v Speaker 4>it's true as a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one's ever going to say you're the,</v>

1799
01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:23.540
<v Speaker 4>your pound for pound best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just never going to happen.</v>

1800
01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:26.600
<v Speaker 4>This just not the only way to do this is</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I think.</v>

1801
01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:29.750
<v Speaker 4>He's a champ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chandlers and 1:55 pound champ.</v>

1802
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:31.250
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got two options.</v>

1803
01:17:31.251 --> 01:17:34.430
<v Speaker 4>Either he sticks it out with Bella and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bella tour continues to grow.</v>

1804
01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.350
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even my man,</v>

1805
01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:38.150
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is,</v>

1806
01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:40.430
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the best fucking commentators in</v>

1807
01:17:40.431 --> 01:17:44.480
<v Speaker 4>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make him have to fake excitement</v>

1808
01:17:44.481 --> 01:17:47.630
<v Speaker 4>about like Ken shamrock versus Hoists</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gracie.</v>

1809
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:51.170
<v Speaker 4>They're doing ultimate hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not doing good moves.</v>

1810
01:17:51.171 --> 01:17:53.060
<v Speaker 4>These are not good moves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That one was bad.</v>

1811
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:55.050
<v Speaker 4>That's a bad move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1812
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:58.220
<v Speaker 4>for a guy like Jimmy Smith who was like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a legit fan,</v>

1813
01:17:58.221 --> 01:18:01.370
<v Speaker 4>as well as being an excellent</v>
<v Speaker 4>commentator,</v>

1814
01:18:01.630 --> 01:18:04.340
<v Speaker 4>like that's a bad place to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have to,</v>

1815
01:18:04.341 --> 01:18:06.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're making this guy have to hype up</v>

1816
01:18:06.201 --> 01:18:07.080
<v Speaker 4>some Horse Shit.</v>

1817
01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:11.090
<v Speaker 4>You want that paycheck bitch get crunk</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ken shamrock hoists,</v>

1818
01:18:11.091 --> 01:18:13.760
<v Speaker 4>Gracie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven dot 5,000 and Kimbo.</v>

1819
01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.700
<v Speaker 4>It'd be crunk like Justin combat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You better be crunk too.</v>

1820
01:18:16.701 --> 01:18:20.030
<v Speaker 4>Like it's Mike Tyson holyfield.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've taking half your paycheck.</v>

1821
01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:22.070
<v Speaker 4>Know there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing good about that.</v>

1822
01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.990
<v Speaker 4>So I hope they don't have to do that</v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

1823
01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.810
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully step away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1824
01:18:26.811 --> 01:18:30.290
<v Speaker 4>like the chandler fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chandler could.</v>

1825
01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:35.380
<v Speaker 4>It's conceivable that if spike really</v>
<v Speaker 4>keeps pumping and keep putting it up and</v>

1826
01:18:35.991 --> 01:18:36.824
<v Speaker 4>keeps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1827
01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:41.600
<v Speaker 4>firing up the coals of promotion that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get to a point where people start</v>

1828
01:18:41.601 --> 01:18:44.290
<v Speaker 4>mentioning Chandler alongside other</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

1829
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:47.330
<v Speaker 4>you to sign more guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the deal is with</v>

1830
01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:49.100
<v Speaker 4>reading Mcdonald.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His contract is up.</v>

1831
01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:51.270
<v Speaker 4>Granted he lost a wonderboy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

1832
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:53.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know bell tours can make a strong push</v>

1833
01:18:53.931 --> 01:18:56.690
<v Speaker 4>to sign that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you got to get these free agents and</v>

1834
01:18:56.691 --> 01:18:59.420
<v Speaker 4>have a stable because right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1835
01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:00.590
<v Speaker 4>We just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at,</v>

1836
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:04.580
<v Speaker 4>look at UFC $200.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck amy person on it?</v>

1837
01:19:04.581 --> 01:19:08.660
<v Speaker 4>Any tandem could fight for a main event</v>
<v Speaker 4>and belt or any night of the week.</v>

<v Speaker 4>him in a war,</v>

1868
01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:17.810

<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] CIOCCA.</v>

1869
01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:21.000
<v Speaker 4>Like getting nicked by right hand and</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting drop.</v>

1870
01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:23.130
<v Speaker 4>You can say it's a fluke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stylize it closed.</v>

1871
01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.390
<v Speaker 4>I saw even a fluke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wanted to punch you.</v>

1872
01:20:25.391 --> 01:20:27.400

1873
01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:30.200
<v Speaker 4>Then a fucking submission that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>calculated like,</v>

1897
01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:26.100
<v Speaker 4>that's the kind of fight that he really</v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't be taking 100 percent guys who</v>

1898
01:21:26.101 --> 01:21:28.110
<v Speaker 4>were thrown to the wolves and build a</v>
<v Speaker 4>kid up.</v>

1899
01:21:28.111 --> 01:21:30.840

<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 4>But for Stud,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the fucking sleeper that no one's</v>

1902
01:21:37.201 --> 01:21:39.460
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tj dillashaw how fell.</v>

1903
01:21:39.490 --> 01:21:42.420
<v Speaker 4>Sun Sail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough fight for Tj.</v>

1904
01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.430
<v Speaker 4>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1905
01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:48.570
<v Speaker 4>And who won a sunset in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but very,</v>

1906
01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:51.320
<v Speaker 4>very close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people had tj winning [inaudible]</v>

1907
01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.940
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tj,</v>

<v Speaker 4>this fight.</v>

1909
01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.580

<v Speaker 4>I'll go who really need the to win.</v>

1910
01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:03.750
<v Speaker 4>But I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes a little tank man,</v>

1911
01:22:03.751 --> 01:22:05.040
<v Speaker 4>he's a super tank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1912
01:22:05.041 --> 01:22:07.710
<v Speaker 4>Tj is the biggest favorite on this card.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

1913
01:22:07.770 --> 01:22:11.700
<v Speaker 4>I think four to one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think just because a sense I was past</v>

1914
01:22:11.701 --> 01:22:12.391
<v Speaker 4>record,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1916
01:22:15.181 --> 01:22:17.070
<v Speaker 4>brown?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1917
01:22:17.071 --> 01:22:18.090
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1918
01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:20.430
<v Speaker 4>Brown like plus 2:25,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1919
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:22.820
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll look at that as Jamie was Jamie</v>

1920
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:27.830
<v Speaker 4>and with the quickness to 80,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to 90 to 90.</v>

1921
01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:31.110
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's my upset pick of the night if I'm</v>

1922
01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:33.020
<v Speaker 4>good at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1923
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:35.460
<v Speaker 4>I could see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could see that being John Jones is a</v>

1924
01:22:35.461 --> 01:22:36.720
<v Speaker 4>big favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

1925
01:22:36.810 --> 01:22:37.920
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1926
01:22:38.670 --> 01:22:41.260
<v Speaker 4>but there's a couple of people who need</v>
<v Speaker 4>wins.</v>

1927
01:22:42.230 --> 01:22:45.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean Jose Aldo and Joseph Aldo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

1928
01:22:45.871 --> 01:22:48.030
<v Speaker 4>he's been gone for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got murked by Mcgregor.</v>

1929
01:22:48.031 --> 01:22:49.230
<v Speaker 4>Tough Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kind of need to.</v>

1930
01:22:49.231 --> 01:22:51.810
<v Speaker 4>When Travis Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he loses this one.</v>

1931
01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.333
<v Speaker 4>It's tough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1932
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:56.950
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm surprised that that uh,</v>

1933
01:22:57.060 --> 01:23:00.900
<v Speaker 4>Aldo and edgar is basically dead even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1934
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:02.310
<v Speaker 4>Who would you give it to?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although,</v>

1935
01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:06.220
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's</v>

1936
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:08.740
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm not surprised because you</v>

1937
01:23:08.741 --> 01:23:11.500
<v Speaker 1>really don't fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go back and look at all those</v>

1938
01:23:11.501 --> 01:23:14.950
<v Speaker 1>past performances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at his last fight with Chad</v>

1939
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Mendez before he fight mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before he fought mcgregor.</v>

1940
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:18.290
<v Speaker 1>Fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever.</v>

1941
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1942
01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1943
01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:25.000
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one to call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be even in the odds.</v>

1944
01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:27.250
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking tough fight to call</v>

1945
01:23:27.251 --> 01:23:32.251
<v Speaker 1>them in and the fact that conor was able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to start something like that and frankie</v>

1946
01:23:32.831 --> 01:23:36.300
<v Speaker 1>just shows no sign of slowing down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1947
01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:41.380
<v Speaker 1>that's where he is a fucking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He posted videos of his workout,</v>

1948
01:23:42.630 --> 01:23:46.960
<v Speaker 1>a workout before you went to Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing fucking handstands and</v>

1949
01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:50.080
<v Speaker 1>backflips and he's a monster man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A</v>

1950
01:23:51.730 --> 01:23:53.020
<v Speaker 1>title shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bad.</v>

1951
01:23:53.021 --> 01:23:55.870
<v Speaker 1>He certainly does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very curious about this fight,</v>

1952
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:58.600
<v Speaker 1>although he's never been knocked out</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that before.</v>

1953
01:23:58.630 --> 01:23:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1954
01:23:59.270 --> 01:24:01.750
<v Speaker 1>So we've never seen how he responds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1955
01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:05.080
<v Speaker 1>He could just be a demon of Brazilian</v>
<v Speaker 1>demon.</v>

1956
01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Merck's Frankie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a good fight.</v>

1957
01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frank had a really hard time with his</v>

1958
01:24:09.401 --> 01:24:11.920
<v Speaker 1>leg kicks in that first fight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1959
01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:13.840
<v Speaker 1>really hug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1960
01:24:14.230 --> 01:24:17.020
<v Speaker 1>this was also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1961
01:24:17.290 --> 01:24:20.350
<v Speaker 1>pre Usada true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also frankie,</v>

1962
01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:23.350
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been on a straight wind streets on</v>

1963
01:24:23.410 --> 01:24:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Merkin dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cub,</v>

1964
01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Swanson fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just relentless Mendez.</v>

1965
01:24:27.130 --> 01:24:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Bj Penn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1966
01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Frankie has been on a tear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1967
01:24:31.811 --> 01:24:34.900
<v Speaker 1>who needs to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm fuck him.</v>

1968
01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Johnny hendricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

1969
01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.730
<v Speaker 1>and there's not an easy fight at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird message.</v>

1970
01:24:39.731 --> 01:24:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Especially iF calvin comes in and shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if calvin doesn't have a hard</v>

1971
01:24:44.171 --> 01:24:46.510
<v Speaker 1>time making weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calvin's a beast,</v>

1972
01:24:46.511 --> 01:24:48.340
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a light on his feet.</v>

1973
01:24:48.490 --> 01:24:53.490
<v Speaker 1>He throws off real quick hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got great footwork and he's a</v>

1974
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:55.390
<v Speaker 1>southpaw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a very similar.</v>

1975
01:24:55.450 --> 01:24:58.690
<v Speaker 1>They're very similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's way more agile though on his</v>

1976
01:24:58.691 --> 01:25:00.430
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See way more footwork.</v>

1977
01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:02.950
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think johnny puts things together</v>

1978
01:25:02.951 --> 01:25:06.340
<v Speaker 1>better and I think I think kevin's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to struggle with because calvin is</v>

1979
01:25:06.341 --> 01:25:09.070
<v Speaker 1>usually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's that grinder like ho ho wrestle.</v>

1980
01:25:09.071 --> 01:25:11.260
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He still those big bombs.</v>

1981
01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Well shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's johnny's fucking gay man.</v>

1982
01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:16.300
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great fight.</v>

1983
01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:19.120
<v Speaker 1>It is a great fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think calvin just needs to be</v>

1984
01:25:19.121 --> 01:25:21.470
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really focused for this fight he has to.</v>

1985
01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:24.970
<v Speaker 1>This is a giant important step for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For both of them.</v>

1986
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.520
<v Speaker 1>What happens is the giant lose this one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's three in a row,</v>

1987
01:25:27.521 --> 01:25:28.390
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1988
01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

1989
01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:32.890
<v Speaker 1>And this is a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a really big one because he's,</v>

1990
01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's facing a young kid on the way up,</v>

1991
01:25:36.011 --> 01:25:39.610
<v Speaker 1>was not top 10 right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The risky fight for johnny.</v>

1992
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:41.350
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain fights in your career</v>

1993
01:25:41.351 --> 01:25:43.900
<v Speaker 1>where it's like a fork in the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1994
01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where you go and it's so competitive.</v>

1995
01:25:46.901 --> 01:25:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Especially at this weight class now it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you lose the kelvin fuck man.</v>

1996
01:25:51.610 --> 01:25:54.640
<v Speaker 1>WeLl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>johnny's lack of mobility got exposed</v>

1997
01:25:54.641 --> 01:25:56.980
<v Speaker 1>and the wonderboy fight will fuck who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>done It.</v>

1998
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1999
01:25:58.030 --> 01:26:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Wonder boys just on another level when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to that karate style.</v>

2000
01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:03.170
<v Speaker 1>But I also think johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2001
01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's always been on discipline outside</v>

2002
01:26:05.031 --> 01:26:07.760
<v Speaker 1>camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's catching up with them now.</v>

2003
01:26:07.761 --> 01:26:08.780
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2004
01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:10.970
<v Speaker 1>there's no ivs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

2005
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:13.380
<v Speaker 1>it's ah ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be disciplined.</v>

2006
01:26:13.381 --> 01:26:15.470
<v Speaker 1>We want to fight at the world class</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

2007
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:17.150
<v Speaker 1>You got to be disciplined outside camp</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2008
01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.700
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't look like a killer in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fight.</v>

2009
01:26:19.730 --> 01:26:22.040
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't look like the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny didn't look.</v>

2010
01:26:22.041 --> 01:26:25.820
<v Speaker 1>I've been joHnny hendricks at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked out marvin camp men or martin</v>

2011
01:26:25.821 --> 01:26:27.080
<v Speaker 1>kampmann or the Johnny Hendricks.</v>

2012
01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.420
<v Speaker 1>He knocked out fitch or the robbie</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawler fight.</v>

2013
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he had fire in his eyes and</v>

2014
01:26:31.431 --> 01:26:35.960
<v Speaker 1>those fights and you got to also take</v>
<v Speaker 1>into consideration a lot of distractions</v>

2015
01:26:35.961 --> 01:26:39.530
<v Speaker 1>outside the octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stArted a fucking restaurant member,</v>

2016
01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:40.850
<v Speaker 1>started a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

2017
01:26:40.851 --> 01:26:43.910
<v Speaker 1>he owned break open a steakhouse and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>went under with the quickness.</v>

2018
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Not mad at that idea though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do the reviews were hard to shitty</v>

2019
01:26:49.611 --> 01:26:51.550
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This terrible food.</v>

2020
01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Cooking steaks and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he was a bad idea,</v>

2021
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:59.540
<v Speaker 1>but why would you do that in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your competitive career?</v>

2022
01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who fucking told him to do</v>

2023
01:27:01.431 --> 01:27:01.691
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2024
01:27:01.691 --> 01:27:03.950
<v Speaker 1>he probably just invested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

2025
01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.050
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't affect his training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It affects.</v>

2026
01:27:06.051 --> 01:27:08.750
<v Speaker 1>you will remember he left that camp</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2027
01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He left with the.</v>

2028
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:13.610
<v Speaker 1>In their agreement was we take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of this and we pay for</v>

2029
01:27:13.611 --> 01:27:15.380
<v Speaker 1>everything and things was like fuck this</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2030
01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he hasn't been the same man.</v>

2031
01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Well they paid for everything too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gave hIm a salary and then they</v>

2032
01:27:21.891 --> 01:27:23.380
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had hired all these trainers.</v>

2033
01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Will all these camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's super camps.</v>

2034
01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:28.550
<v Speaker 1>They all hemorrhage cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2035
01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:32.570
<v Speaker 1>like the black zillions are in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation right now because the owner</v>

2036
01:27:32.571 --> 01:27:35.660
<v Speaker 1>just declared bankruptcy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about that,</v>

2037
01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Glenn Robinson?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2038
01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:38.730
<v Speaker 1>make sure that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2039
01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:39.270
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2040
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:42.620
<v Speaker 1>it's that it wasn't affecting the black</v>
<v Speaker 1>zillions at the time.</v>

2041
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:45.223
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

2042
01:27:45.730 --> 01:27:48.350
<v Speaker 1>No money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen funds that.</v>

2043
01:27:48.710 --> 01:27:51.680
<v Speaker 1>The only way those things make money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way those camps make money.</v>

2044
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way is if they become</v>

2045
01:27:54.021 --> 01:27:58.700
<v Speaker 1>successful for a long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like jackson's were like jackson's done</v>

2046
01:27:58.701 --> 01:28:00.290
<v Speaker 1>it the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have world champions.</v>

2047
01:28:00.291 --> 01:28:02.660
<v Speaker 1>They have elite high level athletes</v>
<v Speaker 1>train there all the time.</v>

2048
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:06.770
<v Speaker 1>They slowly develop a massive fuCking</v>
<v Speaker 1>clientele.</v>

2049
01:28:06.771 --> 01:28:10.940
<v Speaker 1>They have massive amounts of students so</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are paying dues and they can</v>

2050
01:28:10.941 --> 01:28:13.340
<v Speaker 1>expand its students though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the key word.</v>

2051
01:28:13.341 --> 01:28:16.370
<v Speaker 1>You students pay the bill though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hilton and the flutters bring the</v>

2052
01:28:16.371 --> 01:28:18.020
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people don't do that.</v>

2053
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like blackzilians.</v>

2054
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that for any classes they</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid like overindulge a gillion dollars</v>

2055
01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:26.780
<v Speaker 1>to ladies and that didn't even work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worked out by himself in the corner.</v>

2056
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I apparently didn't enjoy training with</v>

2057
01:28:29.631 --> 01:28:30.464
<v Speaker 1>everybody else.</v>

2058
01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not play well with others.</v>

2059
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:35.620
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2060
01:28:35.621 --> 01:28:37.480
<v Speaker 1>he threw a lot of cash at people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2061
01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:40.640
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a rich guy that doesn't know the</v>

2062
01:28:40.641 --> 01:28:44.930
<v Speaker 1>sport tool manufacturer with more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 million in debt filed chapter 11.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She said tool,</v>

2064
01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:49.670
<v Speaker 1>when you have more than 10 million in</v>
<v Speaker 1>debt,</v>

2065
01:28:49.671 --> 01:28:52.910
<v Speaker 1>that means jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're richer than him because he owes</v>

2066
01:28:52.911 --> 01:28:54.620
<v Speaker 1>10 million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know $10 million.</v>

2181
01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:40.840
<v Speaker 4>I may have been john,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2182
01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was about rashawn rashad's the</v>

2183
01:33:44.651 --> 01:33:46.750
<v Speaker 4>captain of that team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just weird,</v>

2184
01:33:46.751 --> 01:33:47.271
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2185
01:33:47.271 --> 01:33:50.290
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know they've invested in you.</v>

2186
01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:53.410
<v Speaker 4>It was a good switch up for me because</v>
<v Speaker 4>my managers down there and he had a huge</v>

2187
01:33:53.411 --> 01:33:56.650
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I needed a change and different sparring</v>

2188
01:33:56.651 --> 01:33:58.450
<v Speaker 4>partners.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I flew down there for two weeks and</v>

2189
01:33:58.451 --> 01:34:02.320
<v Speaker 4>then fly back and forth as you can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably wasn't the smartest.</v>

2190
01:34:02.321 --> 01:34:06.100
<v Speaker 4>The fight didn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carets seemed like a good facility down</v>

2191
01:34:06.101 --> 01:34:06.970
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

2192
01:34:06.971 --> 01:34:07.870
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just.</v>

2193
01:34:07.871 --> 01:34:08.740
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just all right.</v>

2194
01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:09.491
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing,</v>

2195
01:34:09.491 --> 01:34:10.720
<v Speaker 4>nothing crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just all right.</v>

2196
01:34:10.721 --> 01:34:12.340
<v Speaker 4>Compared to other gyms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2197
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:16.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the best facility right now?</v>

2198
01:34:16.121 --> 01:34:17.860
<v Speaker 4>Going?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it att tristar?</v>

2199
01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:19.600
<v Speaker 4>Tristar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How so?</v>

2200
01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:22.750
<v Speaker 4>I think tristar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because for ross,</v>

2201
01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:23.441
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2202
01:34:23.441 --> 01:34:24.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not</v>

2203
01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:27.490
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't want fame.</v>

2204
01:34:27.970 --> 01:34:29.860
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a fighter himself.</v>

2205
01:34:29.861 --> 01:34:32.200
<v Speaker 4>He's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At kickboxing,</v>

2206
01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:35.480
<v Speaker 4>jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He teaches the jujitsu in a geeky.</v>

2207
01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:37.770
<v Speaker 4>So there's their students,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he's not riding,</v>

2208
01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:40.630
<v Speaker 4>dying off the paycheck of rory or gsp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that.</v>

2209
01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:43.420
<v Speaker 4>There's professional boxers that work</v>
<v Speaker 4>out there.</v>

2210
01:34:43.421 --> 01:34:45.430
<v Speaker 4>They have a boxing ring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have an octagon,</v>

2211
01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:47.333
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a,</v>

2212
01:34:47.410 --> 01:34:50.650
<v Speaker 4>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a motivating environment as far as</v>

2213
01:34:51.370 --> 01:34:53.230
<v Speaker 4>like other gyms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's intimidating.</v>

2214
01:34:53.231 --> 01:34:54.340
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>

2215
01:34:54.370 --> 01:34:54.940
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>

2216
01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 4>Like I remember going to jackson jackson</v>
<v Speaker 4>world class,</v>

2217
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:02.030
<v Speaker 2>best of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like nonstop sparring and I</v>

2218
01:35:02.031 --> 01:35:02.900
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck man.</v>

2219
01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:04.850
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my coaches from denver weren't there</v>

2220
01:35:04.851 --> 01:35:07.190
<v Speaker 2>when I'd go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was like I just always,</v>

2221
01:35:07.191 --> 01:35:10.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm so intimidated there all the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was just straight up banging.</v>

2222
01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:13.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be a problem too,</v>

2223
01:35:13.551 --> 01:35:17.120
<v Speaker 2>right at the balance between sparring</v>
<v Speaker 2>and technical work.</v>

2224
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:20.650
<v Speaker 2>Like a keith jardine and I were just</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

2225
01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Haven't seen keith for ever chiesa close</v>
<v Speaker 2>friend man and I look at keith because</v>

2226
01:35:25.011 --> 01:35:27.980
<v Speaker 2>keith and he's doing the act and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing well and he was talking about</v>

2227
01:35:27.981 --> 01:35:30.530
<v Speaker 2>the podcast game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff and we're laughing.</v>

2228
01:35:30.710 --> 01:35:34.070
<v Speaker 2>I go pro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember how we used to fucking spar?</v>

2229
01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Remember you go in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would do a round with me.</v>

2230
01:35:38.301 --> 01:35:40.430
<v Speaker 2>You'd stay in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shame would climb in.</v>

2231
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:42.860
<v Speaker 2>You do two rounds with him and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would jump in.</v>

2232
01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:44.540
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck were we thinking?</v>

2233
01:35:45.710 --> 01:35:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are older than me.</v>

2234
01:35:46.881 --> 01:35:48.500
<v Speaker 2>I thought you guys knew what was up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2235
01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:50.810
<v Speaker 2>insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man in st stephen goes,</v>

2236
01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I wish I would've stopped sooner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's those last couple.</v>

2237
01:35:54.051 --> 01:35:56.980
<v Speaker 2>I wish someone had told me because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking about our lives.</v>

2238
01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:58.610
<v Speaker 2>I wish someone would've told me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2239
01:35:58.611 --> 01:36:00.770
<v Speaker 2>I wish I would have stopped sooner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the last one.</v>

2240
01:36:00.771 --> 01:36:04.130
<v Speaker 2>We're wasting my time because we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about mutual friend.</v>

2241
01:36:04.131 --> 01:36:05.900
<v Speaker 2>We have a very close friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2242
01:36:05.901 --> 01:36:07.360
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish she would stop man.</v>

2243
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:09.470
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just talked to another dates.</v>

2244
01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.140
<v Speaker 2>I dunno man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still want to do it.</v>

2245
01:36:13.490 --> 01:36:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get a guy to walk away from</v>

2246
01:36:16.101 --> 01:36:20.480
<v Speaker 2>it because everything else is so muted</v>
<v Speaker 2>in dl and the experience of competing is</v>

2247
01:36:20.590 --> 01:36:24.260
<v Speaker 2>such a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive rush of excitement and the</v>

2248
01:36:24.261 --> 01:36:27.830
<v Speaker 2>bleakness of the possibilities and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities outside of the cage.</v>

2249
01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:28.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>

2250
01:36:28.730 --> 01:36:29.570
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if that,</v>

2251
01:36:29.610 --> 01:36:31.580
<v Speaker 2>the issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's your identity,</v>

2252
01:36:31.581 --> 01:36:33.500
<v Speaker 2>like most any athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just fighters,</v>

2253
01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:35.270
<v Speaker 2>football players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxers,</v>

2254
01:36:35.271 --> 01:36:36.950
<v Speaker 2>basketball players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's your identity,</v>

2255
01:36:36.951 --> 01:36:38.810
<v Speaker 2>like you're known as mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fighter and mr.</v>

2256
01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a depressing man.</v>

2257
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Super depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

2258
01:36:44.031 --> 01:36:45.890
<v Speaker 2>let's look at that card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else we got on that card?</v>

2259
01:36:46.170 --> 01:36:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what do you,</v>

2260
01:36:47.231 --> 01:36:50.190
<v Speaker 2>what do you like in the frankie and</v>
<v Speaker 2>aldo?</v>

2261
01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:53.210
<v Speaker 2>That's the toughest fight for me to pick</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2262
01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:57.290
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take away the last fight with</v>

2263
01:36:57.291 --> 01:37:02.291
<v Speaker 2>frankie or with a aldo and conor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes a tough fight for</v>

2264
01:37:02.571 --> 01:37:05.330
<v Speaker 2>frankie to when frank has got to be at</v>
<v Speaker 2>his best.</v>

2265
01:37:05.331 --> 01:37:06.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an underdog,</v>

2266
01:37:07.130 --> 01:37:12.050
<v Speaker 2>but frankie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at his victories and you gotta</v>

2267
01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:14.110
<v Speaker 2>think he looks better than ever like</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankie's,</v>

2268
01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:18.950
<v Speaker 2>that he's in his prime right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will unquestionably in his prime the cub</v>

2269
01:37:18.951 --> 01:37:21.050
<v Speaker 2>swanson fight chose that the.</v>

2270
01:37:21.050 --> 01:37:24.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your wife's favorite fight was not very</v>

2271
01:37:24.471 --> 01:37:29.471
<v Speaker 2>impressive that uriah faber fight was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight where he just sort of one,</v>

2272
01:37:30.710 --> 01:37:32.230
<v Speaker 2>but it was not that big of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2273
01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:33.860
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking tough to finish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2274
01:37:34.010 --> 01:37:36.860
<v Speaker 2>He is tough to finish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But dominick cruz beat the shit out of</v>

2275
01:37:36.861 --> 01:37:40.250
<v Speaker 2>him and dominick cruz did it in a much</v>
<v Speaker 2>more convincing way.</v>

2276
01:37:40.850 --> 01:37:44.900
<v Speaker 2>You know frankie beat Him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Chad mendez fight with spectacular</v>

2277
01:37:44.901 --> 01:37:46.520
<v Speaker 2>first round knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was amazing.</v>

2278
01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:47.540
<v Speaker 2>And you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mma.</v>

2279
01:37:47.541 --> 01:37:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Math never works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know this,</v>

2280
01:37:48.981 --> 01:37:52.580
<v Speaker 2>but when you see what frankie did to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chad mendez,</v>

2281
01:37:52.581 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 2>they look at more that aldo in Chad</v>
<v Speaker 2>mendez had.</v>

2282
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:58.040
<v Speaker 1>It's just so impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2283
01:37:58.050 --> 01:38:01.740
<v Speaker 1>But then you look at what aldo did to</v>
<v Speaker 1>uriah faber,</v>

2284
01:38:01.770 --> 01:38:06.450
<v Speaker 1>beat the fucking brakes off him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He beat the fucking life out of them,</v>

2285
01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.680
<v Speaker 1>beat the life out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you look at frankie did room.</v>

2286
01:38:08.681 --> 01:38:10.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not as impressive and maybe math</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work,</v>

2287
01:38:10.850 --> 01:38:12.830
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you got to remember now that</v>

2288
01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:16.410
<v Speaker 1>there's new testing involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying on things,</v>

2289
01:38:16.411 --> 01:38:18.110
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying we only have one</v>
<v Speaker 1>brazilian champ before.</v>

2290
01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Had many more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you know,</v>

2291
01:38:19.801 --> 01:38:21.680
<v Speaker 1>forget about just talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>resilience.</v>

2292
01:38:21.690 --> 01:38:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I go all fighters across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see first of all,</v>

2293
01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.490
<v Speaker 1>although is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is he 32 holds.</v>

2294

2386
01:42:39.190 --> 01:42:41.980
<v Speaker 4>she was saying he was like the issue</v>
<v Speaker 4>with her.</v>

2387
01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:43.630
<v Speaker 4>She never wants to game plan and watch</v>
<v Speaker 4>tape.</v>

2388
01:42:43.631 --> 01:42:45.230
<v Speaker 4>She Just wants to fight and scrap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2389
01:42:45.370 --> 01:42:47.620
<v Speaker 4>Which at a certain level you just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just can't.</v>

2390
01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:48.850
<v Speaker 4>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

2392
01:42:50.321 --> 01:42:53.740
<v Speaker 4>You do have to game plan tendencies and</v>
<v Speaker 4>she never wanted to.</v>

2393
01:42:53.741 --> 01:42:55.420
<v Speaker 4>She hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It made her,</v>

2394
01:42:55.421 --> 01:42:57.120
<v Speaker 4>it stressed her out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>

2395
01:42:57.140 --> 01:43:00.820
<v Speaker 4>the coaches would do it but tell her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like in that ronda fight,</v>

2396
01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:04.210
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't brunch straight at her and</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>

2402
01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:16.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2403
01:43:16.090 --> 01:43:18.190
<v Speaker 4>it's not for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

01:43:24.651 --> 01:43:26.860
<v Speaker 4>a disadvantage.</v>

<v Speaker 2>decision.</v>

2448

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2449
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:21.380
<v Speaker 2>No one's clamoring for a rematch.</v>

2450
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:25.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean this guy goes out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Merck's hanan barao fights Joe Soto on</v>

2451
01:45:25.911 --> 01:45:27.950
<v Speaker 2>one day's notice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beat him down,</v>

2452
01:45:27.951 --> 01:45:31.870
<v Speaker 2>beat him in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then goes in and my works and,</v>

2453
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.040
<v Speaker 2>and borrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second time he came out just</v>

2454
01:45:34.130 --> 01:45:35.350
<v Speaker 2>destroys him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2455
01:45:35.351 --> 01:45:35.630
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2456
01:45:35.630 --> 01:45:38.900
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loses a close close decision to dominick</v>

2457
01:45:38.901 --> 01:45:39.561
<v Speaker 2>cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's like,</v>

2458
01:45:39.561 --> 01:45:40.850
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hold.</v>

2459
01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:42.690
<v Speaker 2>not really interested in anymore the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports.</v>

2460
01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for tj,</v>

2461
01:45:45.921 --> 01:45:49.940
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the kid was not only did I like</v>

2462
01:45:49.941 --> 01:45:52.280
<v Speaker 2>and I said this and I meant it</v>
<v Speaker 2>wholeheartedly.</v>

2463
01:45:52.610 --> 01:45:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only did He submit his position as a</v>

2464
01:45:54.621 --> 01:45:56.450
<v Speaker 2>champion when he beat hanan barao the</v>
<v Speaker 2>second time,</v>

2465
01:45:56.630 --> 01:45:59.570
<v Speaker 2>but I said he made a very good argument</v>
<v Speaker 2>for being one of the best pound for</v>

2466
01:45:59.571 --> 01:46:02.450
<v Speaker 2>pound fighters in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think after that hennen browne fight,</v>

2467
01:46:02.451 --> 01:46:07.451
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking he's like top 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even like top five or six pound</v>

2468
01:46:07.641 --> 01:46:09.540
<v Speaker 2>fighters in the world is tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's taught 10.</v>

2469
01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:11.030
<v Speaker 2>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tough now.</v>

2470
01:46:11.031 --> 01:46:12.790
<v Speaker 2>It's tough because you lost the decision</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cruise.</v>

2471
01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:14.810
<v Speaker 2>See if he beats cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you go.</v>

2472
01:46:14.811 --> 01:46:16.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids got a real argument there.</v>

2473
01:46:16.810 --> 01:46:19.580
<v Speaker 2>He's top five and he could have beaten</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2474
01:46:19.581 --> 01:46:20.414
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2475
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:25.310
<v Speaker 2>all tj dillashaw needed was a few more</v>
<v Speaker 2>well placed leg kicks in tHat fight.</v>

2476
01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:29.300
<v Speaker 2>If he had gone in concentrated Heavily</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that right leg kick,</v>

2477
01:46:29.301 --> 01:46:31.610
<v Speaker 2>dominick cruz out a fucked up foot</v>
<v Speaker 2>memory.</v>

2478
01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:34.820
<v Speaker 2>That plantar fasciitis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is brutal.</v>

2479
01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:38.600
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he could have easily,</v>

2480
01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:41.810
<v Speaker 2>could have easily went that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also started planting his feet,</v>

2481
01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:43.670
<v Speaker 2>digging his toes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2482
01:46:43.671 --> 01:46:45.980
<v Speaker 2>he was headhunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to dominic fuck with his</v>

2483
01:46:45.981 --> 01:46:47.690
<v Speaker 2>head man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dominic got in there.</v>

2484
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:50.460
<v Speaker 2>I want to see that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see tj and dominant.</v>

2485
01:46:50.490 --> 01:46:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I want to see.</v>

2486
01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:54.150
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they're going to do.</v>

2487
01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Who's dominant going to find next to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he have a fight scheduled?</v>

2488
01:46:56.940 --> 01:47:00.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they need to fucking to tj.</v>

2491
01:47:08.910 --> 01:47:13.910
<v Speaker 2>motherfucking dotson at 1:35.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John dodson at 1:35 is terrifying.</v>

2492
01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:18.690
<v Speaker 2>He also beat tj on ultimate fighter k</v>
<v Speaker 2>odom.</v>

2493
01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:24.140
<v Speaker 2>He killed him and he is fast as fuck and</v>
<v Speaker 2>lights people on fire.</v>

2494

<v Speaker 2>Let me know.</v>

2496
01:47:29.610 --> 01:47:31.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying if he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lost this guy.</v>

2497
01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:34.190
<v Speaker 2>He could or he might have to fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>dodson.</v>

2498
01:47:34.670 --> 01:47:36.690
<v Speaker 2>If he loses fighting dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if he wins?</v>

2499
01:47:36.691 --> 01:47:39.930
<v Speaker 2>He might fight dots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you do that because if you</v>

2500
01:47:39.931 --> 01:47:42.180
<v Speaker 2>hate ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to go.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Tj,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tj.</v>

2503
01:47:46.321 --> 01:47:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Uriah faber is where the money's at.</v>

2504
01:47:48.330 --> 01:47:49.990
<v Speaker 2>That's the play and What's left for</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

2505
01:47:50.010 --> 01:47:52.860
<v Speaker 2>I met a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wouldn't be so fun.</v>

2506
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:55.560
<v Speaker 2>It was so cloSe though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes me sad anymore.</v>

2507
01:47:56.430 --> 01:47:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes me sad.</v>

2508
01:47:58.200 --> 01:47:59.090
<v Speaker 2>it really does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2509
01:47:59.091 --> 01:48:03.090
<v Speaker 2>That's a bummer because when two guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>are bros like that bros before hoes,</v>

2510
01:48:03.091 --> 01:48:05.190
<v Speaker 2>what happened to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody says that anymore.</v>

2511
01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:06.960
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's old school now.</v>

2512
01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:13.770
<v Speaker 2>TJ and uriah were so tight and soak in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tj still tight with Chad.</v>

2513
01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Chad and him was still buddies and joe</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

2514
01:48:16.170 --> 01:48:17.920
<v Speaker 2>They're still buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you right?</v>

2515
01:48:17.930 --> 01:48:21.030
<v Speaker 2>Like you hold a grudge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they both do.</v>

2516
01:48:21.031 --> 01:48:24.240
<v Speaker 2>That's why the fight would make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd be crunk for it too.</v>

2517
01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder like how much your rise got</v>

2518
01:48:26.701 --> 01:48:28.830
<v Speaker 2>left in the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like the way dominic was</v>

2519
01:48:28.831 --> 01:48:30.040
<v Speaker 2>hurting him in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2520
01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:32.040
<v Speaker 2>rule dot makes a fucking months.</v>

01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Here's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's never been known to be a</v>

2522
01:48:34.351 --> 01:48:36.280
<v Speaker 2>knockout artists other than the</v>

<v Speaker 2>real trouble and he put your riot in a</v>

2526
01:48:46.081 --> 01:48:49.290
<v Speaker 2>defensive shell multiple times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But let me tell you something.</v>

2527
01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:52.890
<v Speaker 2>This is an unheralded guide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How fIle sun out number three in the</v>

2528
01:48:52.891 --> 01:48:53.724
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2529
01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:56.460
<v Speaker 2>And as far as contenders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tj is the number one contender,</v>

2530
01:48:56.850 --> 01:48:59.550
<v Speaker 2>but half hour is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's talkinG about him,</v>

01:49:01.650 --> 01:49:04.620
<v Speaker 2>So this is a really tough fight for tj</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you got a guy who's already</v>

2533
01:49:04.621 --> 01:49:07.560
<v Speaker 2>beaten by decision is questionable as it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is and it's close.</v>

2534

<v Speaker 2>No one knows who he is.</v>

2538
01:49:20.170 --> 01:49:22.620
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking nightmare and he's beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>him before.</v>

2539
01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not doing tj any favors and</v>

<v Speaker 2>Forget about the bonuses.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Who's getting a bonus in this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>car?</v>

01:55:30.641 --> 01:55:35.641
<v Speaker 1>undercard of the friday night fights.</v>

01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:49.740

<v Speaker 4>That's at featherweight.</v>

2693
01:55:49.950 --> 01:55:51.840
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting man.</v>

2694
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:55.590
<v Speaker 4>He got and he was a huge 50 fiver like</v>
<v Speaker 4>bulk lies.</v>

2695
01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:59.040

2696
01:55:59.070 --> 01:56:00.420
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was,</v>

2697
01:56:01.290 --> 01:56:02.730
<v Speaker 4>that was probably a big factor</v>

2698
01:56:04.450 --> 01:56:09.450
<v Speaker 4>in a lot of his uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his decision to get lean was the ivy</v>

2699
01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:13.840
<v Speaker 4>ban.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You being that big at 1:55 and having</v>

2700
01:56:13.841 --> 01:56:16.630
<v Speaker 4>all that bulk on them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he probably decided to lean out and then</v>

2701
01:56:16.631 --> 01:56:18.220
<v Speaker 4>as he was leaning out it was probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2702
01:56:18.221 --> 01:56:20.830
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with his frame and its power and might</v>

2703
01:56:20.831 --> 01:56:25.590
<v Speaker 4>even be better at 1:45.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he was just so much things that god</v>

2704
01:56:25.591 --> 01:56:29.170

<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

2706
01:56:30.761 --> 01:56:32.260

<v Speaker 4>he's the thick dude.</v>

2707
01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:34.360
<v Speaker 4>He was a thick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was all muscle.</v>

2708
01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:36.850
<v Speaker 4>The only muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look on his,</v>

2709
01:56:36.910 --> 01:56:39.220
<v Speaker 4>his length please.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you lose that muscle and now</v>

02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:51.240
<v Speaker 2>A bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good idea,</v>

2940
02:06:51.630 --> 02:06:54.270
<v Speaker 2>but bodog fight went under and I don't</v>

02:06:57.610 --> 02:06:59.280
<v Speaker 2>saying at one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2943
02:06:59.281 --> 02:07:03.690
<v Speaker 2>that he would like to take dana with him</v>
<v Speaker 2>on his jet setting lifestyle and show</v>

2944
02:07:03.691 --> 02:07:04.201
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2945
02:07:04.201 --> 02:07:08.580
<v Speaker 2>I invited him to pick him up in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>private jet and so dana could see like</v>

2946
02:07:08.610 --> 02:07:12.460
<v Speaker 2>how he lives and what fuck it was back</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the ufc.</v>

2947
02:07:12.461 --> 02:07:16.650
<v Speaker 2>He really became the ufc in air quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2948
02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:17.913
<v Speaker 2>still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2949
02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:18.920
<v Speaker 2>still grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2950
02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:21.080
<v Speaker 2>but is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's real.</v>

2951
02:07:21.081 --> 02:07:23.640
<v Speaker 2>There's so much confidentiality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to give me a fucking</v>

2952
02:07:23.641 --> 02:07:25.440
<v Speaker 2>straight story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would assume it's real.</v>

2953
02:07:25.590 --> 02:07:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Where there's smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's fire and because it's weird.</v>

2954
02:07:28.021 --> 02:07:30.150
<v Speaker 2>They offered 4 billion and dana was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2955
02:07:30.151 --> 02:07:31.620
<v Speaker 2>effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You left for 4 billion.</v>

2956
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:33.210
<v Speaker 2>I think if somebody offers you 4</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion,</v>

2957
02:07:33.211 --> 02:07:34.080
<v Speaker 2>you've got to say yes.</v>

2958
02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:37.420
<v Speaker 4>Hell yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good luck.</v>

2959
02:07:37.421 --> 02:07:38.860
<v Speaker 4>Scratched together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>4 billion.</v>

2960
02:07:39.130 --> 02:07:42.220
<v Speaker 4>Like there was a number of partners,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even then,</v>

2961
02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:46.020
<v Speaker 4>good luck scratching again at 4 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of money and you know,</v>

2962
02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:47.590
<v Speaker 4>you got to make sure that everything's</v>
<v Speaker 4>in place.</v>

2963
02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:51.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a tricky thing.</v>

2964
02:07:52.270 --> 02:07:53.320
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

2965
02:07:53.321 --> 02:07:55.900
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to have dana stay on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to have dana.</v>

2966
02:07:56.170 --> 02:07:58.690
<v Speaker 4>Without dana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have the same organization.</v>

2967
02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:01.390
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to be able to put</v>
<v Speaker 4>together the fights the same way.</v>

2968
02:08:01.690 --> 02:08:02.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have the same guy doing the</v>

2969
02:08:02.981 --> 02:08:04.900
<v Speaker 4>press conferences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same figurehead.</v>

2970
02:08:04.930 --> 02:08:06.350
<v Speaker 4>It's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stolen.</v>

2971
02:08:06.370 --> 02:08:09.400
<v Speaker 4>Why would you buy it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyone that with that ego,</v>

2972
02:08:09.401 --> 02:08:12.150
<v Speaker 4>if they have 4 billion or get these</v>
<v Speaker 4>three mega companies,</v>

2973
02:08:12.151 --> 02:08:15.640
<v Speaker 4>the other by 3 billion or 4 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have other ideas for</v>

2974
02:08:15.641 --> 02:08:19.690
<v Speaker 4>the organization so you can't buy it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then just leaving all the same.</v>

2975
02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:24.900
<v Speaker 4>You buy it and you give dana a piece,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so not only do you pay him,</v>

2976
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:28.540
<v Speaker 4>but you also give him a piece of the new</v>
<v Speaker 4>organization so that he can get even</v>

2977
02:08:28.541 --> 02:08:31.570
<v Speaker 4>stupid richer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You came a piece,</v>

2978
02:08:31.571 --> 02:08:33.070
<v Speaker 4>but you're going to have to have someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2979
02:08:33.071 --> 02:08:36.340
<v Speaker 4>let's say you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You hire a dude from fucking apple to</v>

2980
02:08:36.341 --> 02:08:39.410
<v Speaker 4>come in and run it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This grant is not.</v>

2981
02:08:39.610 --> 02:08:42.010
<v Speaker 4>Let's say that's your idea though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2982
02:08:42.011 --> 02:08:43.450
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're buying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not buying it like,</v>

2983
02:08:43.630 --> 02:08:44.690
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just keep doing what you do.</v>

2984
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:47.050
<v Speaker 4>Your bikes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have some ideas like you don't</v>

2985
02:08:47.051 --> 02:08:50.710
<v Speaker 4>become a millionaire because you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking using someone else's ideas.</v>

2986
02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:52.780
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2987
02:08:52.781 --> 02:08:54.550
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You must have some ideas,</v>

2988
02:08:54.551 --> 02:08:58.990
<v Speaker 4>but it's possible that it's an ego</v>
<v Speaker 4>purchase that a bunch of guys got</v>

2989
02:08:58.991 --> 02:09:00.070
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't be awesome.</v>

2990
02:09:00.071 --> 02:09:02.020
<v Speaker 4>If we own the ufc and they find out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2991
02:09:02.021 --> 02:09:04.480
<v Speaker 4>what's the revenue every year they make</v>
<v Speaker 4>x amount per year,</v>

2992
02:09:05.050 --> 02:09:05.510
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2993
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:06.190
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so look,</v>

2994
02:09:06.190 --> 02:09:08.830
<v Speaker 4>if we put together x amount of billions</v>
<v Speaker 4>of dollars,</v>

2995
02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:11.410
<v Speaker 4>they have fight pass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That brings in a fuck load of money.</v>

2996
02:09:11.411 --> 02:09:14.380
<v Speaker 4>Now fight pass has a lot of members and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're paying.</v>

2997
02:09:14.381 --> 02:09:16.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember how much I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a member of fight pass.</v>

2998
02:09:16.721 --> 02:09:19.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember how much I pay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's like nine bucks a month</v>

2999
02:09:19.181 --> 02:09:19.780
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

3000
02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:20.700
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>

3001
02:09:20.701 --> 02:09:22.930
<v Speaker 4>Give to joe rogan for free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just pay.</v>

3002
02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:24.190
<v Speaker 4>I pay for a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3003
02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:26.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't mind paying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hear you for sure.</v>

3004
02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:31.990
<v Speaker 4>My own supplements</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get sponsored.</v>

3005
02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:36.270
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3006
02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:40.240
<v Speaker 4>I think that if they were smart they</v>
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>

3007
02:09:40.270 --> 02:09:42.700
<v Speaker 4>they would see that there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>value in it.</v>

3008
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:46.390
<v Speaker 4>But is there enough value to come up</v>
<v Speaker 4>with $4,000,000,000 to pay for it?</v>

3009
02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:52.800
<v Speaker 4>I think there's one way to look at this</v>
<v Speaker 4>where someone might say,</v>

3010
02:09:53.610 --> 02:09:55.890
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've been running it like the goal of</v>

3011
02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:57.030
<v Speaker 4>boy's club let.</v>

3012
02:09:57.110 --> 02:10:00.430
<v Speaker 4>What happens if we didn't make this a</v>
<v Speaker 4>legit league?</v>

3013
02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:02.980
<v Speaker 4>Like you have a commissioner and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a fighters' union.</v>

3014
02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:06.310
<v Speaker 4>what if we ran a junior for warming</v>
<v Speaker 4>money?</v>

3015
02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:10.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're.</v>

3016
02:10:10.450 --> 02:10:12.520
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to bite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to have a different idea.</v>

3017
02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:15.390
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can just run it as it is.</v>

3018
02:10:15.410 --> 02:10:18.670
<v Speaker 4>HeY,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you can scale facility purchase?</v>

3019
02:10:18.700 --> 02:10:20.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do the exact same thing and maybe</v>

3020
02:10:20.890 --> 02:10:24.340
<v Speaker 4>with buying it you can nullify the</v>
<v Speaker 4>reebok deal.</v>

3021
02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:27.460
<v Speaker 4>Someone might just fucking hate reebok.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

3022
02:10:27.461 --> 02:10:30.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm a bike just to get rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just keep doing the same thing.</v>

3023
02:10:30.910 --> 02:10:35.390
<v Speaker 4>It's not a bad idea.</v>

<v Speaker 4>get some super resistant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have terrible superpowers.</v>

3091
02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 4>Edibles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is not</v>

3092
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:35.310
<v Speaker 2>uncommon because Mike Schmidt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's my guest yesterday apparently has</v>

3093
02:13:35.311 --> 02:13:37.590
<v Speaker 2>the same issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't edibles,</v>

3094
02:13:37.591 --> 02:13:41.010
<v Speaker 2>do not affect him and mike smokes a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of weed so maybe that has something to</v>

3095
02:13:41.011 --> 02:13:44.120
<v Speaker 2>do with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but jamie does not get hot.</v>

3096
02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:49.080
<v Speaker 2>But you tried tums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone told you three times and then</v>

3097
02:13:49.081 --> 02:13:52.620
<v Speaker 2>gave it like a half hour to try to set</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and then try to 150 milligram cookie.</v>

3098
02:13:52.621 --> 02:13:54.690
<v Speaker 2>where'd you get the idea of toms on</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter?</v>

3099
02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:57.570
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've asked lots of people at different,</v>

3100
02:13:58.020 --> 02:13:59.520
<v Speaker 2>different potheads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different nutrition.</v>

3101
02:13:59.521 --> 02:14:01.590
<v Speaker 2>I think I've even asked rhonda patrick</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she came in one time,</v>

3102
02:14:01.591 --> 02:14:05.280
<v Speaker 2>if she had any idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had five minutes to kill.</v>

3103
02:14:06.270 --> 02:14:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I figured out she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3104
02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:09.210
<v Speaker 2>I know I shut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She might've just said,</v>

3105
02:14:09.211 --> 02:14:10.920
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what her answer was,</v>

3106
02:14:10.921 --> 02:14:13.200
<v Speaker 2>but I've never heard the tums acid thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

3107
02:14:13.610 --> 02:14:16.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 11 hydroxy metabolite.</v>

3108
02:14:16.770 --> 02:14:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might have a thing.</v>

3109
02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:21.810
<v Speaker 2>That's my dad who's been eating it for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time since the sixties,</v>

3110
02:14:21.811 --> 02:14:26.040
<v Speaker 2>seventies and debbie and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been going deep.</v>

3111
02:14:26.130 --> 02:14:30.110
<v Speaker 2>He said jeanette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the administration he's got.</v>

3112
02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:32.510
<v Speaker 2>He's a hippie guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3113
02:14:32.850 --> 02:14:35.790
<v Speaker 2>But like his sister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be my aunt also doesn't have any</v>

3114
02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:37.800
<v Speaker 2>reaction to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what a shitty sound.</v>

3115
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:41.790
<v Speaker 2>The genetic thing could be some weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>dna switch that's not honoring.</v>

3116
02:14:43.020 --> 02:14:45.600

3140
02:15:42.140 --> 02:15:43.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>makes your grandma,</v>

3142
02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:49.500

<v Speaker 2>you should let them have their pot and</v>

3143
02:15:49.501 --> 02:15:49.860
<v Speaker 2>their booze.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3147
02:15:55.231 --> 02:15:57.750
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'd have to prove that they</v>

3148
02:15:57.751 --> 02:16:01.260
<v Speaker 2>weren't the right age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would have to like just be selling</v>

3149
02:16:01.261 --> 02:16:04.080
<v Speaker 2>someone under age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All my mom would have to do is go to a</v>

3150
02:16:04.081 --> 02:16:05.430
<v Speaker 2>hotel room and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3154

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3155
02:16:13.230 --> 02:16:14.230

<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

3156
02:16:14.231 --> 02:16:16.410
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you been in some of those weed</v>

3157
02:16:16.411 --> 02:16:18.240
<v Speaker 2>shops in denver?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the ipad store.</v>

3158
02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:19.740
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

3159
02:16:20.020 --> 02:16:23.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of legalization obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3160
02:16:23.670 --> 02:16:27.030
<v Speaker 2>obviously I'm Montana where I was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>

3161
02:16:27.031 --> 02:16:32.031
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they just in august of new</v>
<v Speaker 2>draconian measure kicks in and they're</v>

3162
02:16:33.491 --> 02:16:37.330
<v Speaker 2>trying to put the kabash on those</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking ranchers and cowboys out there.</v>

3163
02:16:37.330 --> 02:16:39.250
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to put the kibosh on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3164
02:16:39.850 --> 02:16:41.440
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pot movement out there.</v>

3165
02:16:41.441 --> 02:16:45.580
<v Speaker 2>And what they've done is they've put</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some heavy restrictions on the</v>

3166
02:16:45.581 --> 02:16:50.581
<v Speaker 2>amount of people that doctors can</v>
<v Speaker 2>prescribe marijuana to the amount of</v>

3167
02:16:51.370 --> 02:16:56.370
<v Speaker 2>people that care givers can prescribe it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to or dispense it to.</v>

3168
02:16:56.680 --> 02:16:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're a caregiver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

3169
02:16:58.001 --> 02:17:01.390
<v Speaker 2>Just like in a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a license,</v>

3170
02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:05.740
<v Speaker 2>I go to a store that might serve fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand people who knows it might</v>

3171
02:17:05.741 --> 02:17:08.350
<v Speaker 2>serve more than a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go in there and there's just tons of</v>

3172
02:17:08.351 --> 02:17:11.350
<v Speaker 2>people all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has prescriptions and it</v>

3173
02:17:11.351 --> 02:17:15.310
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in Montana they're making it pretty</v>

3174
02:17:15.311 --> 02:17:17.670
<v Speaker 2>difficult to have a legit reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3175
02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:20.530
<v Speaker 2>well we're staying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were staying at this hotel called the</v>

3176
02:17:20.531 --> 02:17:24.010
<v Speaker 2>element in bozeman and right across the</v>
<v Speaker 2>street was this pot shop.</v>

3177
02:17:24.490 --> 02:17:25.030
<v Speaker 2>And I was looking.</v>

3178
02:17:25.030 --> 02:17:27.040
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect right there.</v>

3179
02:17:27.430 --> 02:17:28.290
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ooh,</v>

3180
02:17:28.300 --> 02:17:29.740
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what kind of restrictions they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

3181
02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:31.840
<v Speaker 2>So then I googled it and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh boy,</v>

3182
02:17:31.841 --> 02:17:36.841
<v Speaker 2>it's about to come down on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing with Montana didn't denver</v>

3183
02:17:36.971 --> 02:17:39.870
<v Speaker 2>set the blueprint like we're getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>rebates,</v>

3184
02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.400
<v Speaker 2>tax rebates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denver's like we have too much moneY.</v>

3185
02:17:42.401 --> 02:17:44.560
<v Speaker 2>We cannot store it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just give it to the people.</v>

3186
02:17:44.740 --> 02:17:46.900
<v Speaker 2>These ranchers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't even read in the newspaper.</v>

3187
02:17:46.901 --> 02:17:49.390
<v Speaker 2>They get smoke signals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're barely paying attention to</v>

3188
02:17:49.391 --> 02:17:50.830
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in the rest of the free</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

3189
02:17:51.490 --> 02:17:52.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whose.</v>

3190
02:17:53.430 --> 02:17:58.120
<v Speaker 2>This is just a lot of people that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea that pot smokers are dumb and</v>

3191
02:17:58.121 --> 02:18:01.210
<v Speaker 2>lazy and a problem and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

3192
02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:05.800
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of pot smokers like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are like me that work hard as fuck and</v>

3193
02:18:05.801 --> 02:18:09.460
<v Speaker 2>are just adults and we want to be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do whatever the fuck we want to go to</v>

3194
02:18:09.461 --> 02:18:11.200
<v Speaker 2>venice beach because that could help you</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

3195
02:18:11.220 --> 02:18:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Help you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those doctors.</v>

3196
02:18:13.661 --> 02:18:16.800
<v Speaker 2>I went in there to talk on those doctors</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is so fucking shading.</v>

3197
02:18:16.810 --> 02:18:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Everyone in here is illusory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fitzsimmons Was talking to me about the</v>

3198
02:18:19.691 --> 02:18:22.240
<v Speaker 2>last time I was in denver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a few too many kids</v>

3199
02:18:22.241 --> 02:18:26.080
<v Speaker 2>playing hacky sack on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a point.</v>

3200
02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:28.410
<v Speaker 2>We can't generalize everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3201
02:18:28.411 --> 02:18:33.130
<v Speaker 2>when you get a place like denver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is it becomes a magnet to</v>

3202
02:18:33.131 --> 02:18:35.860
<v Speaker 2>people that are attracted by</v>
<v Speaker 2>legalization.</v>

3203
02:18:35.861 --> 02:18:38.860
<v Speaker 2>A lot of those people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're listless or drifters.</v>

3204
02:18:38.980 --> 02:18:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or they're people that are there.</v>

3205
02:18:42.190 --> 02:18:44.170
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be the place where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be me,</v>

3206
02:18:44.171 --> 02:18:46.990
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if it was legal everywhere,</v>

3207
02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:49.880
<v Speaker 2>they would stay where they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3208
02:18:49.930 --> 02:18:52.810
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't have to go somewhere to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get pot.</v>

3209
02:18:53.050 --> 02:18:58.050
<v Speaker 2>So if you feel like you should keep the</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural ecosystem of losers in all their</v>

3210
02:18:58.151 --> 02:19:00.310
<v Speaker 2>natural environments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you have one place and it's the</v>

3211
02:19:00.311 --> 02:19:03.800
<v Speaker 2>only place where they can get pot and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitches are all over denver and venice,</v>

3212
02:19:04.090 --> 02:19:09.090
<v Speaker 2>there was a way you could give people an</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of what motivation and</v>

3213
02:19:09.941 --> 02:19:11.890
<v Speaker 2>discipline can reward you with.</v>

3214
02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Like I reallY did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

3215
02:19:13.740 --> 02:19:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Understanding you don't think social</v>
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>

3216
02:19:16.031 --> 02:19:19.270
<v Speaker 2>instagram and seeing you commentate and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

3217
02:19:19.390 --> 02:19:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Does that for people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3218
02:19:21.370 --> 02:19:24.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean some people that are just</v>

3219
02:19:24.161 --> 02:19:25.660
<v Speaker 2>like say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it this way.</v>

3220
02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Say if you had a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously you do have a kid,</v>

3221
02:19:28.041 --> 02:19:32.410
<v Speaker 2>but say if you had like a 20 year old</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's just a fucking doper where a</v>

3222
02:19:32.500 --> 02:19:34.700
<v Speaker 2>wakened bakes and doesn't get anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

3223
02:19:34.701 --> 02:19:38.540
<v Speaker 2>It's just always like hanging out with</v>
<v Speaker 2>his friends and playing video games and</v>

3224
02:19:38.541 --> 02:19:43.541
<v Speaker 2>he's just a fucking loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish there was a way you could show</v>

3225
02:19:44.361 --> 02:19:47.270
<v Speaker 2>someone like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I know that you're getting some</v>

3226
02:19:47.271 --> 02:19:50.520
<v Speaker 2>comfort and satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just laying around doing nothing,</v>

3227
02:19:50.570 --> 02:19:51.590
<v Speaker 2>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting fat,</v>

3228
02:19:51.860 --> 02:19:55.310
<v Speaker 2>but your life would feel better and</v>
<v Speaker 2>richer.</v>

3229
02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:57.680
<v Speaker 2>If you had a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you chase that goal,</v>

3230
02:19:57.681 --> 02:20:00.770
<v Speaker 2>you accomplish some things and you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>get this boost of confidence.</v>

3231
02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:03.790
<v Speaker 2>You'd get tHis boost of self esteem like</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that you're going to do,</v>

3232
02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:05.240
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you're in a drawing comic</v>
<v Speaker 2>books.</v>

3233
02:20:05.241 --> 02:20:09.440
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're into making fucking pottery</v>
<v Speaker 2>or sculptures or who,</v>

3234
02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:11.780
<v Speaker 2>but fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck that is,</v>

3235
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:15.800
<v Speaker 2>and pursue that instead of doing nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the people that are doing nothing.</v>

3236
02:20:16.190 --> 02:20:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Those are the real pen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3237
02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:21.170
<v Speaker 2>doing something might be as simple as</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3238
02:20:21.171 --> 02:20:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Alex honnold guy climbs rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's world class rock climber.</v>

3239
02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:30.470
<v Speaker 2>It's something but it's also a goal of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his and he's also the best at it.</v>

3240
02:20:30.530 --> 02:20:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those.</v>

3241
02:20:32.180 --> 02:20:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Those people who smoked pot all day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>do those.</v>

3242
02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys who hate on joe rogan for being</v>

3243
02:20:36.021 --> 02:20:37.000
<v Speaker 2>in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying,</v>

3244
02:20:37.001 --> 02:20:40.130
<v Speaker 2>or being disciplined or get on kevin</v>
<v Speaker 2>harts and scram and hate on,</v>

3245
02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:41.240
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they don't,</v>

3246
02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:44.600
<v Speaker 2>it's their own insecurities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

3247
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:47.570
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would assume they would get motivated</v>

3248
02:20:47.571 --> 02:20:51.170
<v Speaker 2>by seeing other people do something with</v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives.</v>

3249
02:20:51.171 --> 02:20:52.610
<v Speaker 2>Like that should be motivating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>

3250
02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but courage you up if you grew up with</v>

3251
02:20:55.191 --> 02:20:58.240
<v Speaker 2>losers and you're around a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people with shitty attitudes,</v>

3252
02:20:58.241 --> 02:21:01.130
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's in your household.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very lucky that,</v>

3253
02:21:01.131 --> 02:21:04.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both my mom and my stepdad there.</v>

3254
02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:05.061
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

3255
02:21:05.061 --> 02:21:08.480
<v Speaker 2>They're the least hater people I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>met my life.</v>

3256
02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:12.230
<v Speaker 2>They're just not haters in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone's doing well,</v>

3257
02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:13.220
<v Speaker 2>there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3258
02:21:13.221 --> 02:21:14.300
<v Speaker 2>look at this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or like,</v>

3259
02:21:14.301 --> 02:21:15.270
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at her.</v>

3260
02:21:15.271 --> 02:21:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Or wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at him.</v>

3261
02:21:16.370 --> 02:21:21.050
<v Speaker 2>There was never any hate in my house in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of other people's success.</v>

3262
02:21:21.051 --> 02:21:23.540
<v Speaker 2>But if you grow up with a dad and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3266
02:21:29.691 --> 02:21:33.110
<v Speaker 2>there's people that look at other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's success and instead of saying,</v>

3267
02:21:33.111 --> 02:21:33.621
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3268
02:21:33.621 --> 02:21:37.010
<v Speaker 2>I did a lot of work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the way I'm a successful person,</v>

3269
02:21:37.220 --> 02:21:39.740
<v Speaker 2>but the way I look at Kevin Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he exhausts me,</v>

3270
02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:41.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the rock.</v>

3271

<v Speaker 2>But some people they see that and they</v>

3275
02:21:54.501 --> 02:21:57.590
<v Speaker 2>compare themselves and they don't like</v>
<v Speaker 2>it so they could start getting really</v>

3276
02:21:57.591 --> 02:22:01.730
<v Speaker 2>shitty and it's like a natural feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to chip away at that person.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>

3317
02:23:37.950 --> 02:23:39.090
<v Speaker 2>He's a smart dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3318
02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:40.560

3319
02:23:40.561 --> 02:23:43.860
<v Speaker 2>he's positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to have a talk with a mutual</v>

3320
02:23:43.861 --> 02:23:48.210
<v Speaker 2>friend of ours where we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about work and I said it's all relative</v>

3321
02:23:48.211 --> 02:23:50.640
<v Speaker 2>because we look at you look at a used</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3322
02:23:50.850 --> 02:23:53.580
<v Speaker 2>I used a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of guys who were in the same</v>

3323
02:23:53.581 --> 02:23:57.390
<v Speaker 2>field and it's like you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of work they're doing compared to</v>

3324
02:23:57.391 --> 02:24:01.080
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing and it's just you work</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3325
02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:05.300
<v Speaker 2>Like I think our definition of work is</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different because I might</v>

3326
02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:07.290
<v Speaker 2>look at joe rogan and say,</v>

3328
02:24:09.540 --> 02:24:13.440
<v Speaker 2>but you didn't start there like it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming if you look at the huge</v>

3329
02:24:13.441 --> 02:24:17.280
<v Speaker 2>picture of the body of work of a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's successful,</v>

3330
02:24:17.430 --> 02:24:19.590
<v Speaker 2>but he started just like you did</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>

3331
02:24:19.591 --> 02:24:21.690
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3332
02:24:21.691 --> 02:24:24.150
<v Speaker 2>shut down because too Much of a hill to</v>

<v Speaker 1>those stars.</v>

3527
02:33:03.150 --> 02:33:07.980

<v Speaker 1>to do with the russian mob or organized</v>

3528
02:33:07.981 --> 02:33:08.850
<v Speaker 1>crime or something.</v>

02:33:08.920 --> 02:33:11.970
<v Speaker 1>So he had them covered over with those</v>
<v Speaker 1>designs.</v>

3530
02:33:12.270 --> 02:33:16.050
<v Speaker 1>So that's the original ones there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they're those weird.</v>

3531
02:33:16.051 --> 02:33:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Let's be some serious shit if you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to cover him up where pride.</v>

3532
02:33:19.141 --> 02:33:19.801
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yo man,</v>

3533
02:33:19.801 --> 02:33:21.990
<v Speaker 1>we got to cover these up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think pride wanted them to do</v>

3534
02:33:21.991 --> 02:33:22.530
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3535
02:33:22.530 --> 02:33:25.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably just reached a turning point</v>

3536
02:33:25.081 --> 02:33:26.490
<v Speaker 1>in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

3537
02:33:26.491 --> 02:33:28.170
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get out though.</v>

3538
02:33:28.890 --> 02:33:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3539
02:33:29.970 --> 02:33:30.810

<v Speaker 1>he's in prison.</v>

3540
02:33:30.811 --> 02:33:32.850

<v Speaker 1>Do we know?</v>

3541
02:33:33.150 --> 02:33:36.750
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's rape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course,</v>

02:33:43.261 --> 02:33:44.580
<v Speaker 1>You hear about ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jim hillman.</v>

3545
02:33:44.790 --> 02:33:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Fuck and horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But great guy.</v>

3546
02:33:47.821 --> 02:33:51.600
<v Speaker 1>He was great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently got hit by a car,</v>

3547
02:33:51.660 --> 02:33:54.330
<v Speaker 1>got out to check the damage and whoever</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit him random over.</v>

3548
02:33:54.870 --> 02:33:56.160
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard something else.</v>

3549
02:33:56.190 --> 02:33:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm off.</v>

3550
02:33:57.420 --> 02:33:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you know jay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard he had an altercation inside,</v>

3551
02:33:59.941 --> 02:34:01.240
<v Speaker 1>like a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

3552
02:34:01.380 --> 02:34:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Then it continued outside and the dude</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in a monster truck,</v>

3553
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:07.080
<v Speaker 1>like a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a truck lifted.</v>

3554
02:34:07.260 --> 02:34:10.860
<v Speaker 1>And jim owned him where he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy who hit him was in his truck.</v>

3555
02:34:11.070 --> 02:34:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Then he backed up and ran over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan drove off.</v>

3556
02:34:14.550 --> 02:34:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard,</v>

3557
02:34:16.411 --> 02:34:17.244
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3558
02:34:17.290 --> 02:34:20.320
<v Speaker 1>right after it happened or read about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

3559
02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone I think I saw on twitter,</v>

3560
02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:24.670
<v Speaker 1>rip ryan gmo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

3561
02:34:24.671 --> 02:34:26.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>

3562
02:34:27.070 --> 02:34:28.870
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went no.</v>

3563
02:34:29.230 --> 02:34:34.230
<v Speaker 1>And then then I saw some reports and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think they probably didn't have all the</v>

3564
02:34:34.841 --> 02:34:36.790
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hair goes.</v>

3565
02:34:37.150 --> 02:34:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Thirty four year old jim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was involved in a verbal altercation</v>

3566
02:34:39.491 --> 02:34:42.370
<v Speaker 1>with two suspects before it was hit by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vehicle to men.</v>

3567
02:34:42.371 --> 02:34:47.371
<v Speaker 1>That truck identified as anthony get</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoal and Jordan Wagner immediately fled</v>

3568
02:34:48.911 --> 02:34:52.810
<v Speaker 1>the scene soon after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but were eventually arrested less than a</v>

3569
02:34:52.811 --> 02:34:55.300
<v Speaker 1>week after the incident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There subsequently charged with second</v>

3570
02:34:55.301 --> 02:34:58.300
<v Speaker 1>degree murder and accessory after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact to the murder respectably.</v>

3571
02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Want to just propose to her on the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>home from the movies truck began</v>

3572
02:35:06.401 --> 02:35:09.640
<v Speaker 1>tailgating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think our storage combined make this</v>

3573
02:35:09.641 --> 02:35:12.820
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we took a left to let them go by.</v>

3574
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Now they're both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3575
02:35:14.531 --> 02:35:15.850
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First?</v>

3576
02:35:15.860 --> 02:35:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Reading the parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No clue where we were at.</v>

3577
02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:21.610
<v Speaker 1>These guys pulled up real close behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>ryan almost if they're going to hit us,</v>

3578
02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:23.680
<v Speaker 1>both felt nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3579
02:35:23.681 --> 02:35:26.410
<v Speaker 1>And felt the need to do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we didn't want them following us</v>

3580
02:35:26.411 --> 02:35:27.730
<v Speaker 1>out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of scary.</v>

3581
02:35:28.570 --> 02:35:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Something not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3582
02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:32.610
<v Speaker 1>To talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were not nice guys.</v>

3583
02:35:32.611 --> 02:35:34.930
<v Speaker 1>When I came to get back to philadelphia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went back,</v>

3584
02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:39.310
<v Speaker 1>talked to them after the two men hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentleman sped off.</v>

3585
02:35:39.820 --> 02:35:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus christ.</v>

3586
02:35:44.410 --> 02:35:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

3587
02:35:45.371 --> 02:35:47.380
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are fucking crazy.</v>

3588
02:35:47.381 --> 02:35:49.030
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>

3589
02:35:49.031 --> 02:35:53.260
<v Speaker 1>You just for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cut somebody off and they on math</v>

3590
02:35:53.261 --> 02:35:57.420
<v Speaker 1>and they just decided to run you over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She holds no hatred towards the men that</v>

3591
02:35:57.421 --> 02:35:59.920
<v Speaker 1>killed jim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Owen is merely trying to remain positive</v>

3592
02:35:59.921 --> 02:36:02.320
<v Speaker 1>through her moments of grief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good girl.</v>

3593
02:36:02.710 --> 02:36:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Good luck with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3594
02:36:04.751 --> 02:36:07.600
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a shitty situation,</v>

3595
02:36:07.601 --> 02:36:08.830
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3596
02:36:09.610 --> 02:36:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's heavy.</v>

3597
02:36:14.060 --> 02:36:16.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions that you make in this life and</v>

3598
02:36:16.871 --> 02:36:21.490
<v Speaker 1>that's a big one that people make is</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hostility behind the wheel.</v>

3599
02:36:21.790 --> 02:36:24.820
<v Speaker 1>But I see it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching these guys real recently</v>

3600
02:36:24.821 --> 02:36:26.350
<v Speaker 1>just screaming and yelling at each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their car.</v>

3601
02:36:26.351 --> 02:36:28.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could easily end up in death and</v>

3602
02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:30.130
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

3603
02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:32.580
<v Speaker 1>these guys could easily get out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot each other or me,</v>

3604
02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:36.970
<v Speaker 1>I just assumed they have guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so which might be a weird way to look at</v>

3605
02:36:36.971 --> 02:36:37.990
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a safe way.</v>

3606
02:36:38.210 --> 02:36:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Like literally last night we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving through venice,</v>

3607
02:36:40.721 --> 02:36:43.420
<v Speaker 1>July 4th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the light turned yellow,</v>

3608
02:36:43.450 --> 02:36:44.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's busy.</v>

3609
02:36:44.350 --> 02:36:48.100
<v Speaker 1>So like I'm in the way of them going the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other way and this dude just like move</v>

3610
02:36:48.101 --> 02:36:51.620
<v Speaker 1>out the fucking idiot and the people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car you might go like,</v>

3611
02:36:52.540 --> 02:36:53.630
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want me to do?</v>

3612
02:36:53.660 --> 02:36:55.800
<v Speaker 1>You want me to yell back at him for</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3613
02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:57.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3614
02:36:57.611 --> 02:36:59.980
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who cares man?</v>

3615
02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:01.480
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3616
02:37:01.510 --> 02:37:04.450
<v Speaker 1>it's not hard to get a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not hard to get a gun</v>

3617
02:37:04.451 --> 02:37:06.890
<v Speaker 1>here in los angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus if it's a little guy barking this,</v>

3618
02:37:06.980 --> 02:37:08.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason.</v>

3619
02:37:08.201 --> 02:37:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Why is that confidence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well usually they're just stupid,</v>

3620
02:37:11.170 --> 02:37:16.170
<v Speaker 1>but it's possible that he has a gun too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all the to things like what we're</v>

3621
02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:17.960
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the difference between,</v>

3622
02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:20.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in a community where there's less</v>

3623
02:37:20.811 --> 02:37:23.660
<v Speaker 1>people and people value people versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in,</v>

3624
02:37:23.940 --> 02:37:24.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>

3625
02:37:24.771 --> 02:37:28.490
<v Speaker 1>jimmo lives up in edmonton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a crowded place in edmonton</v>

3626
02:37:28.491 --> 02:37:31.790
<v Speaker 1>is a city to big city is a pretty good</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of people up there,</v>

3627
02:37:31.791 --> 02:37:33.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like los angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3628
02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:35.900
<v Speaker 1>But you know how people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are drunk and they're</v>

3629
02:37:35.901 --> 02:37:38.420
<v Speaker 1>doing drugs and there's all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit going on.</v>

3630
02:37:38.421 --> 02:37:39.590
<v Speaker 1>It's clouding your judgment.</v>

3631
02:37:41.860 --> 02:37:44.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bummer.</v>

3632
02:37:44.390 --> 02:37:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a good guy too.</v>

3633
02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Really good guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>wrote rip.</v>

3636
02:37:53.830 --> 02:37:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Jimmo is looking at birth because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow bird on twitter.</v>

3638
02:37:58.220 --> 02:38:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Just to switch it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing what he used to do with some</v>

3639
02:38:01.851 --> 02:38:03.290
<v Speaker 1>other organizations.</v>
