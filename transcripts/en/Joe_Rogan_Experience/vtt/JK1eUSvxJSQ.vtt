00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might have to spark up a joint fess</v>

2
00:00:04.751 --> 00:00:06.700
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just want real deep,</v>

3
00:00:06.701 --> 00:00:08.920
<v Speaker 1>real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping I was hoping would go that</v>

4
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:11.530
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want some you smoke the weed?</v>

5
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.390
<v Speaker 1>I could do it for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be willing to try it ones.</v>

6
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't know if I want to give it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you for the first time.</v>

7
00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:18.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't smoke pot at all.</v>

8
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>The truth is I s I smoked pot once ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in first day of college,</v>

9
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 1>but I never stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's really just once.</v>

10
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

11
00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:31.330
<v Speaker 1>So you smoked pot all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he did it once and you just kept</v>

12
00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.670
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be willing to try it a second time</v>

13
00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you're saying or for</v>

14
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.540
<v Speaker 1>sure what hers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

15
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.180
<v Speaker 1>what has life been like for Scott Adams</v>
<v Speaker 1>during this election?</v>

16
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.853
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.060
<v Speaker 1>came into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

18
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.260
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously always well known for</v>
<v Speaker 1>being the creator of Dilbert,</v>

19
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.690
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.040
<v Speaker 1>along selection cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden there was,</v>

21
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.570
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.940
<v Speaker 1>people that are already in contact with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were saying,</v>

23
00:01:03.941 --> 00:01:05.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott Adams is a trump supporter.</v>

24
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.380
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Scott Adams,</v>

25
00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:09.880
<v Speaker 1>the Dilbert guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a trump supporter.</v>

26
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone assumes you meet someone and</v>

27
00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:17.050
<v Speaker 1>they're uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the creative business,</v>

28
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a creative business,</v>

29
00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:20.230
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you write a comic strip,</v>

30
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.320
<v Speaker 1>you would assume that you would be left</v>
<v Speaker 1>wing guy.</v>

31
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Like almost almost immediately.</v>

32
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm neither left nor right.</v>

33
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

34
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.630
<v Speaker 2>my views didn't match,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

35
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.320
<v Speaker 2>either of the major candidates on</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

36
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 2>So you're a free thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to think I'm right and everybody</v>

37
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:39.890
<v Speaker 2>else was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like that too.</v>

38
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

39
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.070
<v Speaker 2>my larger philosophical grounding is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is informed by my experience,</v>

40
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

41
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 2>I've noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if he knew that.</v>

42
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know you're a hypnotist.</v>

43
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.920
<v Speaker 2>So in my twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to hypnosis school and became an</v>

44
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:57.860
<v Speaker 2>actual train certified hypnotist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

45
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.620
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things you learn as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypnotist is it,</v>

46
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:04.400
<v Speaker 2>the world is backwards to the way people</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally perceive it.</v>

47
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.430
<v Speaker 2>So normally you see the world as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

48
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:09.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90% of the time people are irrational</v>

49
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.940
<v Speaker 2>and doing rational things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but 10% of the time we just go knots and</v>

50
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:14.930
<v Speaker 2>we do stupid things.</v>

51
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.690
<v Speaker 2>And it's because something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This sparked,</v>

52
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the normal view of the world.</v>

53
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.080
<v Speaker 2>The hypnotist view of the world is</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>

54
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.000
<v Speaker 2>The hypnotist says that 90% of the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're a completely irrational and we're</v>

55
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:29.120
<v Speaker 2>just making rationalizations for why we</v>
<v Speaker 2>did things after the fact.</v>

56
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.420
<v Speaker 2>10% of the time we're rational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's only when there's no</v>

57
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:35.060
<v Speaker 2>emotional content to the decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

58
00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:36.680
<v Speaker 2>you're balancing a checkbook or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

59
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to pick up,</v>

60
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best route to someplace.</v>

61
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's how I see the world.</v>

62
00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:45.830
<v Speaker 2>And so when I look at either the trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>supporters or the Clinton supporters,</v>

63
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 2>to me from the hypnotist perspective and</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's studied persuasion for</v>

64
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.120
<v Speaker 2>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used it in my writing.</v>

65
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see both sides as completely</v>

66
00:02:56.841 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of both of them grounded in</v>

67
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 2>complete absurdity is they're just</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

68
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 2>But nobody knows why they're deciding</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the real reasons that people make</v>

70
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 2>decisions are fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>

71
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 2>they have some aspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've,</v>

73
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 2>they've got something they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>solve.</v>

74
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 2>There's something to try to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reasons we give are usually</v>

75
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 2>completely false.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

76
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 2>the grounding for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you think about evolution,</v>

77
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 2>I assume you believe we evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

78
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no requirement in evolution</v>

79
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 2>that we ever understand our environment</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we imagine that we do.</v>

80
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 2>And here's an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could believe that you are a monk.</v>

81
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're reincarnated from the 10th</v>

82
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 2>century monk like Steven Seagal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

83
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 2>He believe that he's like a buddha or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something from an actual,</v>

84
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.000
<v Speaker 2>like he actually got it bestowed upon</v>
<v Speaker 2>him by some Tibetan character.</v>

85
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's use Steven Seagal.</v>

86
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 2>So Steven Seagal can be standing in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>grocery store next to,</v>

87
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 2>let's say a Muslim who believes that his</v>
<v Speaker 2>profit literally flew to heaven on a</v>

88
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 2>winged horse.</v>

89
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 2>Those two people don't live the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

90
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 2>but they both buy groceries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They both go,</v>

91
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 2>they cook it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they live,</v>

92
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 2>they survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it turns out that understanding the</v>

93
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:17.800
<v Speaker 2>reality at an actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 2>I really know what his objective Lee</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening and I get it and I've got a</v>

95
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 2>mental model that's quite accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need any of that.</v>

96
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 2>So it would be deeply unlikely that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved such a specific skill that's</v>

97
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 2>completely unnecessary as far as we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell.</v>

98
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do need to know that if I,</v>

99
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 2>if you run into this wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know your hand is going to hurt.</v>

100
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.170
<v Speaker 2>So there's some basic stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're probably all in even</v>

101
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.040
<v Speaker 2>interpreting that experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

102
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 2>So there's no reason to think that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way I think of it as the way you think</v>

103
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I see the world is this big</v>

104
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:52.561
<v Speaker 2>irrational ball and I use the hypnotist</v>
<v Speaker 2>persuader skills to back up and try to</v>

105
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 2>deduce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 2>what's really driving things.</v>

107
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.950
<v Speaker 2>And when people said I was a trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>supporter,</v>

108
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.300
<v Speaker 2>what they meant was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

109
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.750
<v Speaker 2>they may have only seen part of what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was talking about.</v>

110
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 2>I was writing about his skill as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>persuader.</v>

111
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.170
<v Speaker 2>And what I mean is that I noticed in him</v>
<v Speaker 2>the skills that I've developed over</v>

112
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 2>decades for persuasion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had a higher level than I've ever</v>

113
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:21.880
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning that he is the most persuasive</v>

114
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 2>living human I've ever experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that in terms of,</v>

115
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual technique,</v>

116
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

117
00:05:29.281 --> 00:05:31.300
<v Speaker 2>he's full of technique and it's all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

118
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll give it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you some examples of that.</v>

119
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.810
<v Speaker 2>First Time I noticed it was the very</v>
<v Speaker 2>first debate when Megan Kelly was asking</v>

120
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 2>him the question about the insults he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had allegedly said to women,</v>

121
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.740
<v Speaker 2>not allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said them.</v>

122
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.820
<v Speaker 2>And this is a setup that any other</v>
<v Speaker 2>politician with his set up is totally</v>

123
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 2>trapped because they can either try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like deny they sat at and then somebody</v>

124
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 2>has a videotape and that doesn't work.</v>

125
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Or they can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

126
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's almost nothing you can say.</v>

127
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.010
<v Speaker 2>You're just trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that would have been the end of his</v>

128
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 2>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first debate should have been over.</v>

129
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 2>And if you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you remember what he said?</v>

130
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.403
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

131
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said this,</v>

132
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:13.550
<v Speaker 2>this and this about women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he smiled.</v>

133
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 2>He sort of looked at the audience it</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked like or the camera and he said</v>

134
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.280
<v Speaker 2>only Rosie O'donnell and the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he rubbed it.</v>

135
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 2>And laughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Completely unexpected and a place</v>

136
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 2>inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Provocative.</v>

137
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I noticed was the Rosie</v>

138
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 2>O'donnell is that is a visual image that</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody shares,</v>

139
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got a picture of her.</v>

140
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:36.950
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I say the name and for his base that</v>

141
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 2>he was catering to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an unpopular image and one that</v>

142
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 2>would just suck all the energy away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question,</v>

143
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 2>which was toxic.</v>

144
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 2>And really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

145
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 2>you can't touch the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have to suck all the energy</v>

146
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 2>into another part of the room and wait</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the time to run out.</v>

147
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.880
<v Speaker 2>And that's what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it became the headline,</v>

148
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:55.161
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

149
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:55.731
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

150
00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:58.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly a highlighted the things</v>

151
00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:00.350
<v Speaker 2>he said about women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe more than it would have,</v>

152
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 2>but the way he escaped that got my</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

153
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't look normal.</v>

154
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.283
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

155
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.273
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

156
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 2>that's operating at another level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I looked for more examples of it</v>

157
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 2>and you could see it everywhere and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was especially clear by the time he</v>

158
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:17.190
<v Speaker 2>started saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

159
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.141
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

160
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:19.850
<v Speaker 2>the other visual things he does is he</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

161
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:23.600
<v Speaker 2>build a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can just imagine a wall when he</v>

162
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:24.460
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

163
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're paying too much ransom to a ran</v>

164
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 2>for those soldiers.</v>

165
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.170
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we paid,</v>

166
00:07:29.171 --> 00:07:30.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>400 million or whatever the number is.</v>

167
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.230
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that money piled up.</v>

168
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 2>It'd be so much money you would fill</v>
<v Speaker 2>this room.</v>

169
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 2>You can't even imagine that big pile of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

170
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.560
<v Speaker 2>You always goes for the visual because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that the,</v>

171
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:41.870
<v Speaker 2>the visual part of our Brayden's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dominant part,</v>

172
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 2>and if you can get its attention and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>it on your message,</v>

173
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.230
<v Speaker 2>it talks the rest of your brain and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything you want it to.</v>

174
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he talks about Isis,</v>

175
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.160
<v Speaker 2>he goes visual also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't say they are bad people who's</v>

176
00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:58.550
<v Speaker 2>religions you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been distorted to the type of thing</v>

177
00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:03.551
<v Speaker 2>you might hear from Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says they put you in cages and they</v>

178
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.710
<v Speaker 2>train you in the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They chop your head off.</v>

179
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that you're playing in your</v>

180
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:13.130
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything he does gets more</v>

181
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:15.860
<v Speaker 2>attention than everything everybody else</v>
<v Speaker 2>does because he puts it into a</v>

182
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 2>provocative picture.</v>

183
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.540
<v Speaker 2>So that was the first thing I noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when he got to Jeb Bush and he</v>

184
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 2>needed to defeat jab because he was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>strongest competitor.</v>

185
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.050
<v Speaker 2>So if he couldn't get past him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no point and he wouldn't have</v>

186
00:08:28.051 --> 00:08:30.590
<v Speaker 2>to have a strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he went after him fast and he went</v>

187
00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 2>after him with the low energy kill shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I call these linguistic kill</v>

188
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:37.940
<v Speaker 2>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just an insult,</v>

189
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.080
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a clever nickname.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we saw Clinton tried to come up with</v>

190
00:08:42.081 --> 00:08:44.190
<v Speaker 2>clever nicknames that had no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

191
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.670
<v Speaker 2>no purchase whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like dangerous Donald.</v>

192
00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:47.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just didn't work.</v>

193
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.510
<v Speaker 2>But look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at low Energy Jeb.</v>

194
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Here's how it's engineered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's engineered for confirmation bias,</v>

195
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 2>meaning that want the future to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>this look like a better nickname every</v>

196
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.450
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you want it to match his</v>

197
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 2>physicality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So before I ever heard low energy Jeb,</v>

198
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 2>I had a good impression of Jeb Bush.</v>

199
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 2>I thought when you looked at Jeb Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't you say to yourself,</v>

200
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a cool character.</v>

201
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

202
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he looked like he was an in control.</v>

203
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm,</v>

204
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 2>reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

205
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:22.660
<v Speaker 2>The person you'd want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the,</v>

206
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.050
<v Speaker 2>if the nuclear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

207
00:09:24.051 --> 00:09:27.390
<v Speaker 2>question came up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was some big decision Jeb Bush</v>

208
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:31.590
<v Speaker 2>isn't going to get excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems like a competent CEO competency.</v>

209
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:32.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

210
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.390
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as trump said low energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you see him?</v>

211
00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:40.230
<v Speaker 2>And the other way he was low energy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he will always be low energy.</v>

212
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Lying Ted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lying Ted Lying Ted was beautiful and</v>

213
00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:45.120
<v Speaker 2>tag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you knew that because he's a</v>

214
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 2>politician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometime in the next several months he's</v>

215
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:50.850
<v Speaker 2>going to say stuff that you can say is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lie.</v>

216
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Whether it is or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to.</v>

217
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.220
<v Speaker 2>But more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

218
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.900
<v Speaker 2>ted has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a physicality about him.</v>

219
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.260
<v Speaker 2>The unfortunately he's got beady eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've said this before,</v>

220
00:10:02.261 --> 00:10:06.600
<v Speaker 2>is if you're going to cast a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we need a guy who's looks dishonest,</v>

221
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be his face.</v>

222
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

223
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:13.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's actually dishonest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to make the judgment.</v>

224
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:19.250
<v Speaker 2>So came up with the Zodiac killer thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that a trump fan or was it trump</v>

225
00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:22.620
<v Speaker 2>himself that started saying that Ted was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Zodiac killer.</v>

226
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that probably started with the</v>

227
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:26.424
<v Speaker 2>fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

228
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.130
<v Speaker 2>so the other thing that was fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>harsh,</v>

229
00:10:29.131 --> 00:10:30.570
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he be given speeches.</v>

230
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Are you the Zodiac killer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would scream it out,</v>

231
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:38.040
<v Speaker 2>like imagine having to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And did your father kill you know</v>

232
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.980
<v Speaker 2>somebody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

233
00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His father was,</v>

234
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's dad was the Zodiac killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what the,</v>

235
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.880
<v Speaker 2>cause the Zodiac killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like the 70s,</v>

236
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:45.714
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

237
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Not Be old enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

238
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.090
<v Speaker 2>so crooked Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crooked Hillary,</v>

239
00:10:51.091 --> 00:10:52.450
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah Aliens,</v>

240
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.810
<v Speaker 2>a brilliant ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she wasn't physically,</v>

241
00:10:54.811 --> 00:10:57.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as limber as a young person.</v>

242
00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:01.140
<v Speaker 2>So you could imagine her sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit crooked physically.</v>

243
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.310
<v Speaker 2>And you knew that there would be stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out in which people could say,</v>

244
00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:06.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another example of that.</v>

245
00:11:06.661 --> 00:11:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Crookedness did you see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you thought that in a physical</v>

246
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:10.530
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the way she looked,</v>

247
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:13.140
<v Speaker 2>all I thought about as corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard Crooked Hillary.</v>

248
00:11:13.141 --> 00:11:17.340
<v Speaker 2>I saw her like with like a burglar's</v>
<v Speaker 2>mask on trying to sneak away with bags</v>

249
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:18.780
<v Speaker 2>that had dollar signs on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

250
00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I saw.</v>

251
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 2>If you look at any one of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>individually has nicknames,</v>

252
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.870
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's sort of random.</v>

253
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:26.640
<v Speaker 2>He just got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at them all,</v>

254
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.700
<v Speaker 2>they all have that physicality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all have the uh,</v>

255
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:33.990
<v Speaker 2>the priming so that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll confirmation bias will kick in</v>

256
00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:37.350
<v Speaker 2>whatever you see after that we'll just</v>
<v Speaker 2>fit the label because it's the first</v>

257
00:11:37.351 --> 00:11:38.970
<v Speaker 2>thing you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he's a performer,</v>

258
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

259
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.490
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say Donald Trump is a</v>

260
00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:43.110
<v Speaker 2>businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He most certainly is.</v>

261
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.090
<v Speaker 2>It most certainly is a real estate</v>
<v Speaker 2>investor,</v>

262
00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:48.300
<v Speaker 2>but he's been a public figure for</v>
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>

263
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.460
<v Speaker 2>And when you're a public figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a performer.</v>

264
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.220
<v Speaker 2>He's performing all the time and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>

265
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 2>he</v>

266
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 1>likes to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when he's engaging in people,</v>

267
00:11:57.191 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 1>he makes it personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's gotten very good at what's</v>

268
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:02.710
<v Speaker 1>called playing the dozens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know playing the dozens is tell us</v>

269
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a insult thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

270
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:07.540
<v Speaker 1>like you can like one guy like guys in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

271
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:12.750
<v Speaker 1>the hood in the inner cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started out as a black term,</v>

272
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's essentially like a version of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mama contest.</v>

273
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guys are way better at your mama</v>

274
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:20.470
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're way better at playing.</v>

275
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:23.800
<v Speaker 1>The dozens are way better at shitting on</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people around them.</v>

276
00:12:23.801 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 1>And it's for the entertainment of each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

277
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.290
<v Speaker 1>So a huge thing amongst comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shit on each other constantly left</v>

278
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 1>and right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's generally encouraged and we all</v>

279
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:32.740
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

280
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.460
<v Speaker 1>But when a guy has decades and decades</v>
<v Speaker 1>and decades of this like Donald Trump,</v>

281
00:12:37.461 --> 00:12:41.500
<v Speaker 1>but a very high level because he's known</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a billionaire investor who puts</v>

282
00:12:41.501 --> 00:12:44.530
<v Speaker 1>his name on everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and still win big at which I</v>

283
00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:46.930
<v Speaker 1>talk about developing systems for</v>
<v Speaker 1>succeeding,</v>

284
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.620
<v Speaker 1>one of the systems is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

285
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.500
<v Speaker 1>and you do this too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

286
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.960
<v Speaker 1>stack together what I would call</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary skills until your stack is</v>

287
00:12:55.961 --> 00:12:57.100
<v Speaker 1>different than anybody else's.</v>

288
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.830
<v Speaker 1>So in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a great artist.</v>

289
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

290
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.980
<v Speaker 1>I didn't take any writing writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>courses,</v>

291
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.570
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty good at drawing and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good at writing and up,</v>

292
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.710
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I put them together and I couldn't do</v>

293
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:11.590
<v Speaker 1>a comic strip because it's rare that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get somebody who's,</v>

294
00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:14.290
<v Speaker 1>let's say in the top 10% of three</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things,</v>

295
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's not hard to be in the top 10%</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things if you're,</v>

296
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.540
<v Speaker 1>if you're going after them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at trump,</v>

297
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.560
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a book on negotiating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he knows business,</v>

298
00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:25.900
<v Speaker 1>he knows negotiating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows public speaking.</v>

299
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.940
<v Speaker 1>He has a sense of humor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really good one.</v>

300
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:31.150
<v Speaker 1>He's quick on his feet now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows politics,</v>

301
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:33.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from both the inside and the outside.</v>

302
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows twitter.</v>

303
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.033
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

304
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.290
<v Speaker 1>I could probably go on and you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

305
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.600
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at any one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

306
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.520
<v Speaker 1>he's not the best you've ever seen.</v>

307
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not the best public speaker,</v>

308
00:13:44.351 --> 00:13:48.670
<v Speaker 1>the funniest person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. But there aren't many people who</v>

309
00:13:48.671 --> 00:13:51.460
<v Speaker 1>can do all of those things in the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>10%.</v>

310
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:55.330
<v Speaker 1>But as a public speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's nearly in the top 10%</v>

311
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

312
00:13:57.071 --> 00:14:01.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm just being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he has a very poor efficiency of</v>

313
00:14:01.871 --> 00:14:03.790
<v Speaker 1>of words like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

314
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.580
<v Speaker 1>he uses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he repeats himself when it's not really</v>

315
00:14:06.581 --> 00:14:11.070
<v Speaker 1>important and when we repeats itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I usually see is like someone's</v>

316
00:14:11.071 --> 00:14:13.390
<v Speaker 1>searching for the next thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

317
00:14:13.391 --> 00:14:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Like he'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be honest with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be honest with you.</v>

319
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be honest with you here.</v>

320
00:14:18.831 --> 00:14:20.830
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll do that in a way that is not,</v>

321
00:14:20.831 --> 00:14:22.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not efficient,</v>

322
00:14:22.481 --> 00:14:24.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's persuasive and that's why it</v>
<v Speaker 1>does sometimes.</v>

323
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.360
<v Speaker 1>But it also no repetition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Repetition sometimes.</v>

324
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it's clunky.</v>

325
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he,</v>

326
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:38.260
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's a lot of times where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's his style to do that and he's done</v>

327
00:14:38.261 --> 00:14:42.550
<v Speaker 1>it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even like in delivering lines,</v>

328
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.470
<v Speaker 1>you've got to know when did not talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like here's birth example when he said</v>

329
00:14:47.471 --> 00:14:50.470
<v Speaker 1>that he called the president of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>president of Mexico up and they had the</v>

330
00:14:50.471 --> 00:14:53.180
<v Speaker 1>conversation about the wall and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wall just got 10 foot higher.</v>

331
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.110
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

332
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.760
<v Speaker 1>that's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what I said.</v>

333
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Like he repeats that said he should've</v>
<v Speaker 1>just let it hang.</v>

334
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.740
<v Speaker 1>He should've been said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wall just got 10 foot higher.</v>

335
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:04.550
<v Speaker 1>They would have went crazy and he got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk back and forth and just sucked it</v>

336
00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:05.900
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he kept talking.</v>

337
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.290
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the best speaker like Obama,</v>

338
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 1>I feel is a way better public speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way more efficient with his words,</v>

339
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.020
<v Speaker 1>way better control of the sentences that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he speaks.</v>

340
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.930
<v Speaker 1>But it's more professional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're judging on</v>

341
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.710
<v Speaker 2>a standard that I probably wouldn't use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I took the Dale Carnegie course</v>

342
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:29.210
<v Speaker 2>teaching you how to be a public speaker</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their course taught you zero</v>

343
00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:30.890
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

344
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.310
<v Speaker 2>of course on public speaking in which</v>
<v Speaker 2>they taught you nothing about technique.</v>

345
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.200
<v Speaker 2>The things that you're saying he's doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

346
00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:37.920
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

347
00:15:37.921 --> 00:15:39.240
<v Speaker 1>let me just finish this off shore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

348
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.103
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They taught you</v>

349
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:44.200
<v Speaker 2>confidence and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you were happy and confident,</v>

350
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.720
<v Speaker 2>you would almost always do well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you make a mistake,</v>

351
00:15:46.721 --> 00:15:50.920
<v Speaker 2>you just correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he strikes me as the confident Dale</v>

352
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.900
<v Speaker 2>Carnegie type of Speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person who's,</v>

353
00:15:52.901 --> 00:15:56.020
<v Speaker 2>who's selling an emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an experience.</v>

354
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.090
<v Speaker 2>You're not going there really to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

355
00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.700
<v Speaker 2>It's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

356
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.970
<v Speaker 2>well crafted jokes you're looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going there to feel something and</v>

357
00:16:03.971 --> 00:16:07.140
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't deny that 30,000 people in a</v>

358
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.040
<v Speaker 2>stadium with red hats on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

359
00:16:09.041 --> 00:16:12.970
<v Speaker 2>they were feeling something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in terms of delivering and emotion,</v>

360
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:14.523
<v Speaker 2>top 10%.</v>

361
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

362
00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think that for absolutely one</v>

363
00:16:19.381 --> 00:16:24.381
<v Speaker 1>thing you could say is he knows how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the Donald Trump thing and the Donald</v>

364
00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Trump thing is very different than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the politicians thing.</v>

365
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Donald Trump thing is not humble.</v>

366
00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.660
<v Speaker 1>The Donald Trump thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll tell you about his past successes</v>

367
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.420
<v Speaker 1>and use them to tell you how he's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be successful in the future.</v>

368
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.000
<v Speaker 1>The Donald Trump thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when confronted with certain things,</v>

369
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.400
<v Speaker 1>like the thing about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know him saying something about</v>

370
00:16:41.401 --> 00:16:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Hillary lacking stamina and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes off about having a winning</v>

371
00:16:44.491 --> 00:16:46.320
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a winning temperament.</v>

372
00:16:46.321 --> 00:16:50.310
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of people who could do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in that sort of a political form.</v>

373
00:16:50.311 --> 00:16:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Like if if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say Mitt Romney was running for</v>

374
00:16:53.851 --> 00:16:54.810
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started saying,</v>

375
00:16:54.811 --> 00:16:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I have a winning temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

376
00:16:56.221 --> 00:16:56.980
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

377
00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.170
<v Speaker 1>it's gone fucking crazy.</v>

378
00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember how Howard Dean got knocked</v>

379
00:17:01.291 --> 00:17:04.680
<v Speaker 1>out of the race just for screaming?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just screamed at a rally and it was</v>

380
00:17:04.681 --> 00:17:06.450
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wind came out of the balloon.</v>

381
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.760
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what Howard Dean did wrong,</v>

382
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.410
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He always screamed once.</v>

383
00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.960
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about contrast.</v>

384
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also didn't make fun of it.</v>

385
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:16.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he should have come on and he should</v>

386
00:17:16.831 --> 00:17:19.710
<v Speaker 1>have done something to make fun of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He should have had a speech where he</v>

387
00:17:19.711 --> 00:17:21.900
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got a little carried away folks.</v>

388
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he,</v>

389
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:24.300
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hid from it.</v>

390
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.330
<v Speaker 1>It feels like he could have fixed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

391
00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had that at the time.</v>

392
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the problem was it was contrary to</v>

393
00:17:31.111 --> 00:17:34.830
<v Speaker 1>what he was selling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was selling this buttoned up package</v>

394
00:17:34.831 --> 00:17:37.350
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the middle of that package deal</v>

395
00:17:37.351 --> 00:17:40.500
<v Speaker 1>is a fucking pro wrestling fans</v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming from a Suplex,</v>

396
00:17:40.501 --> 00:17:41.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

397
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.410
<v Speaker 1>like Hulk Hogan Suplex is the iron</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheik.</v>

398
00:17:43.411 --> 00:17:46.110
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that's what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

399
00:17:46.111 --> 00:17:48.180
<v Speaker 1>that's not the guy who you want to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the button.</v>

400
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>So if you heard the studies,</v>

401
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this has been replicated,</v>

402
00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.710
<v Speaker 2>it fairly reliable that if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>addict somebody to something,</v>

403
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.420
<v Speaker 2>let's say this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your Shell,</v>

404
00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you gave them a really good product</v>

405
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.990
<v Speaker 2>every time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually wouldn't be as addictive as</v>

406
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:07.380
<v Speaker 2>if once in a while it wasn't good and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to sorta like wait and</v>

407
00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:08.161
<v Speaker 2>anticipate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

408
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:09.830
<v Speaker 2>there's that good one again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

409
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:10.750
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

410
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.710
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable rewards are far more</v>
<v Speaker 2>addicting,</v>

411
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.720
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

412
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton who reward you every</v>

413
00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:20.460
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just about the same is not</v>

414
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 2>going to be nearly as addicting as</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump.</v>

415
00:18:22.981 --> 00:18:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Who disappoints the fuck out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

416
00:18:25.561 --> 00:18:27.930
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just starting to like you.</v>

417
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Why did you say that that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

418
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.180
<v Speaker 2>And then two weeks later he comes out</v>
<v Speaker 2>with something,</v>

419
00:18:33.181 --> 00:18:34.110
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

420
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:35.670
<v Speaker 2>I love you again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

421
00:18:35.671 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got that addictive pattern going.</v>

422
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once all that grab the pussy stuff got</v>

423
00:18:40.971 --> 00:18:42.420
<v Speaker 1>out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

424
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.220
<v Speaker 1>he was doing a lot of speeches and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rundown the last few days and I watched</v>

425
00:18:46.221 --> 00:18:49.340
<v Speaker 1>a few of them on television because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've almost felt like even though I knew</v>

426
00:18:49.341 --> 00:18:52.010
<v Speaker 1>I was going to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost felt like some sort of a</v>

427
00:18:52.011 --> 00:18:56.840
<v Speaker 1>spectator like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this cannot possibly be real to speak to</v>

428
00:18:56.841 --> 00:19:00.140
<v Speaker 1>your software simulation idea in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning that a lot of people share.</v>

429
00:19:00.141 --> 00:19:02.450
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not just crazy Scott Adams and</v>

430
00:19:02.451 --> 00:19:04.760
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of folks out there</v>

431
00:19:04.761 --> 00:19:06.380
<v Speaker 1>that think that we're living in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>simulation.</v>

432
00:19:06.381 --> 00:19:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as he would give these speeches and</v>

433
00:19:09.471 --> 00:19:12.500
<v Speaker 1>there was some of his speeches he gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there was these moments,</v>

434
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.530
<v Speaker 1>are you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone could tell that guy to keep</v>

435
00:19:15.531 --> 00:19:18.680
<v Speaker 1>it at seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where he's at right there and talk</v>

436
00:19:18.681 --> 00:19:21.530
<v Speaker 1>like that always and avoid all the crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

437
00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.160
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crazy shit is what you get.</v>

438
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing about people like trump</v>

439
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
<v Speaker 1>or like any powerful super dominator</v>
<v Speaker 1>type character like that.</v>

440
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have some flaws.</v>

441
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.573
<v Speaker 1>Lot of them.</v>

442
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Look what he kept saying all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always saying he was the energy</v>

443
00:19:40.841 --> 00:19:42.640
<v Speaker 2>guy yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at my crowds.</v>

444
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.650
<v Speaker 2>The other one has no stamina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one's,</v>

445
00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:45.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low energy.</v>

446
00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knew the facts didn't matter.</v>

447
00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.490
<v Speaker 2>He knew the policy didn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the end,</v>

448
00:19:51.491 --> 00:19:53.950
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody agrees they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

449
00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.480
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by election day,</v>

450
00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.390
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

451
00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.520
<v Speaker 2>I sure like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>TPP standards.</v>

452
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Method.</v>

453
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Like that was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no issues,</v>

454
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.280
<v Speaker 1>no issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

455
00:20:05.281 --> 00:20:07.410
<v Speaker 1>it just came down to which one you</v>
<v Speaker 1>hated.</v>

456
00:20:07.411 --> 00:20:08.244
<v Speaker 1>The more</v>

457
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.550
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
