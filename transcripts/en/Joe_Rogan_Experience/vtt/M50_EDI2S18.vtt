1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>The general experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:04.141
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>so mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who named it mixed martial arts,</v>

4
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>you know what that's a look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole story.</v>

5
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:13.800
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to hear it was you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I give credit to Jeff Blatnick as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at.</v>

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't come up with the term who did?</v>

8
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>But the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>and this is the first thing I can tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

10
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a,</v>

11
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to do what's called a work permit</v>

12
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.290
<v Speaker 1>for lapd because I worked for lapd back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1993 93 in [inaudible] 94.</v>

13
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.570
<v Speaker 1>And it was because I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>referee the second UFC which was March</v>

14
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>11th of 1994.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me to actually work,</v>

15
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>the department has to allow me to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to ask for permission and then</v>

16
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>they have to grant that permission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there a concern that it was too</v>

17
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>outrageous?</v>

18
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.450
<v Speaker 1>That was part of the whole thing is I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to say,</v>

19
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got two guys going into a cage.</v>

20
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>They're going to beat the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

21
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I put was martial</v>

22
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>arts referee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm,</v>

23
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they said,</v>

24
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:10.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of martial arts?</v>

25
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.040
<v Speaker 1>So I wrote mixed martial arts referee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I can tell you that that was in 90,</v>

26
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>right at the end of [inaudible] 93.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the term I didn't get it from</v>

27
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:24.470
<v Speaker 1>anywhere other than I'm sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to think it.</v>

28
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>But I do know that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>columnist,</v>

29
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.970
<v Speaker 1>a sports writer from the La Times that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote about the very first UFC and in</v>

30
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:37.030
<v Speaker 1>his article wrote mixed martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

31
00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>so maybe it was him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>

32
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>well you got John Perretti saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

33
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did it back in 1983 and it's like,</v>

34
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if no one's saying it,</v>

35
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean shit.</v>

36
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.313
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

37
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>So the truth of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so already might have said it in 83,</v>

38
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>he might have said it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't mean anything because the</v>

39
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:57.870
<v Speaker 1>fact of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't matter what I wrote,</v>

40
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>what matters is when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you joined,</v>

41
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>when you joined the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was still considered no holds barred</v>

42
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.690
<v Speaker 1>NHB yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was what we called it and it was</v>

43
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>something that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is probably part of my problem</v>

44
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:16.510
<v Speaker 1>with Campbell Mclaren is back before UFC</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

45
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

46
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>They had them on Good Morning America</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Jim Brown and you go back to that</v>

47
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:25.080
<v Speaker 1>and he came up with the line that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could win by knockout,</v>

48
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:27.730
<v Speaker 1>tap out or death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

49
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.220
<v Speaker 1>And for years after that I was in court</v>
<v Speaker 1>having that thrown in my face by the</v>

50
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>fricken attorney trying to put us down</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

51
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.340
<v Speaker 1>isn't this what you're companies?</v>

52
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what my son says.</v>

53
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what an idiot said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he still to this day things,</v>

55
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>he was magnificent with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was kind of demonic ceremony.</v>

56
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it wouldn't be a problem at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal.</v>

57
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>It's all one thing getting fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shamonic,</v>

58
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you in drugs and you fucked up,</v>

59
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>you fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter if it's shamonic or not.</v>

60
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get high and that tweaks,</v>

61
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>that little thing in my brain that goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>on here.</v>

62
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember in your brain,</v>

63
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I got high for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from the sixties with the best of</v>

64
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got high and it took them down.</v>

65
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them.</v>

66
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>You came through it remarkably unscathed</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it.</v>

67
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you God.</v>

68
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.100
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you God.</v>

69
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.913
<v Speaker 1>Thank you God.</v>

70
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Think about that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

71
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could talk for two hours.</v>

72
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>About Times I did shit and almost died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

73
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

74
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:43.531
<v Speaker 1>and then I could also tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many times I took shit and wrote</v>

75
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening to this guitar lick that</v>
<v Speaker 1>chose plan.</v>

77
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>He did an interview here with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't tell you how it his</v>

78
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>fucking sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would play these riffs and I come</v>

79
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:58.620
<v Speaker 1>down the hallway because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.890
<v Speaker 1>as I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course not as ace it,</v>

81
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>but as I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were up in New England and he was</v>

82
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:07.430
<v Speaker 1>playing at a place and I mowed the lawn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

83
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

84
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.530
<v Speaker 1>my parents place and I quit my last band</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was fucking a little who saw her.</v>

85
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I was crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was no more bands.</v>

86
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 1>The dream was over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He drives up in an mg we go and he's</v>

87
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:21.784
<v Speaker 1>playing that night.</v>

88
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God this happened and so we</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to move down to Boston,</v>

89
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 1>but all in an apartment because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought I knew why those bands didn't</v>

90
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I knew in my heart that if I had a</v>

91
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 1>broan band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm making a keith.</v>

92
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Like the kinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.730
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

94
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.210
<v Speaker 1>and you know ray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of those bands they had,</v>

95
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.063
<v Speaker 1>they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.760
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was two guys that were really tight.</v>

97
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 1>They feed off each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Fed off each other.</v>

98
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we moved down there.</v>

99
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.780
<v Speaker 1>I got really tight with Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear him.</v>

100
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.720
<v Speaker 1>He gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get so swept.</v>

101
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.770
<v Speaker 1>We were so stoned on blue boone's farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean fucking.</v>

102
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd you say?</v>

103
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 1>What'd you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

104
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 1>but he would play these licks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so fucking for every song you've</v>

105
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweet emotion.</v>

106
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Every one of those legs walk this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's 20 that got lost in the ether,</v>

107
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty that got lost in the ether.</v>

108
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>So I went out and bought a little thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the tape recorder back then.</v>

109
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Remember this was 71.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

110
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>a lot of shit wasn't no phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no cell phones.</v>

111
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 1>So I would record that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

112
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 1>what we're going with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

113
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.390
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where these songs came from and</v>

114
00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:42.390
<v Speaker 1>stuff would come out of my head while I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like sweet</v>

115
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.060
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ypo.</v>

118
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the radio.</v>

119
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I used that place.</v>

120
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.220
<v Speaker 1>You get you go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you eat edibles,</v>

121
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>do you ever write some of your routines</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know for sure?</v>

122
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Well and also check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best part of it is when I got sober,</v>

123
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.630
<v Speaker 1>I started writing even better shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go in a room with four guys and say,</v>

124
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 1>we're going into right ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to say in this fucking room</v>

125
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>until we do or until we can't stay in</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of the smell</v>

126
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.670
<v Speaker 1>and we would leave in seven hours with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking song and a good one and one that</v>

127
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 1>would live way past all of us.</v>

128
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.660
<v Speaker 2>Check that shooter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a lot of damage out.</v>

129
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.910
<v Speaker 2>What can be done is the ideas can die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ideas of of fascism,</v>

130
00:06:35.911 --> 00:06:37.950
<v Speaker 2>the ideas of racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

131
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.610
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

132
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.380
<v Speaker 2>those things we can kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are those ideas,</v>

133
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.680
<v Speaker 2>are those ideas being fostered in these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in these communities?</v>

134
00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

135
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.260
<v Speaker 2>They're being cultivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

136
00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:53.940
<v Speaker 2>because you experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

137
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I'm a white guy,</v>

138
00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.110
<v Speaker 2>white guy walking down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

139
00:06:58.111 --> 00:07:02.340
<v Speaker 2>I am a higher degree than the locals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

140

<v Speaker 2>like I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go and shop in some places that</v>

141
00:07:04.831 --> 00:07:07.590
<v Speaker 2>they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go in and sit down and have a meal</v>

142
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.800
<v Speaker 2>in some places that they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can and being greeted on the street.</v>

143
00:07:10.801 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Good Morgan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>not the brown dude next to me.</v>

145
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.060

<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

147
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.720
<v Speaker 2>That's not allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they'll basically created these</v>

148
00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:26.770
<v Speaker 2>little colonies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's diverse.</v>

153
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.300
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy how many people got away with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it that Joseph Mengele died on a beach.</v>

154
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.320
<v Speaker 2>That's Lillian wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

155
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:42.741
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

156
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:45.900
<v Speaker 2>that would hurt me because he's a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>like me just on the ops because he,</v>

157
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a special operations guy.</v>

158
00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:48.550
<v Speaker 2>He was an ss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

159
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:49.170
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

160
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.510
<v Speaker 2>he was a physical specimen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for the time,</v>

161
00:07:51.511 --> 00:07:52.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we didn't,</v>

162
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.310
<v Speaker 2>we didn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

163
00:07:53.311 --> 00:07:57.390
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was very early on into the,</v>

164
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.790
<v Speaker 2>one of the first real Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

165
00:07:59.791 --> 00:08:02.730
<v Speaker 2>this isn't okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of Germany's going this way.</v>

166
00:08:02.731 --> 00:08:06.810
<v Speaker 2>The chancellor is Adolf Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where we're going.</v>

167
00:08:06.811 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 2>I kind of just have to go along and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see some of that in the third year,</v>

168
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.220
<v Speaker 2>like 43,</v>
<v Speaker 2>44 now it's okay.</v>

169
00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.660
<v Speaker 2>We might be losing this war now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not so in vogue,</v>

170
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 2>but when you got guys like 1939 that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to eugenics and um,</v>

171
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher calling for breeding and</v>

172
00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:29.800
<v Speaker 2>segregation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

173
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.680
<v Speaker 2>early on you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

174
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:36.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kona beat him to death with my hands,</v>

175
00:08:36.211 --> 00:08:38.010
<v Speaker 2>but he's massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be a pretty good fight.</v>

176
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.040
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there we go form Nazi cult.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

181
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:51.810
