1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:04.141
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>so mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who named it mixed martial arts.</v>

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.800
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

5
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Look it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole story.</v>

6
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard it was you.</v>

7
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.123
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

8
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I give credit to Jeff Blatnick as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at,</v>

9
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't come up with the term who did,</v>

10
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 1>but the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the first thing I can tell</v>

11
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote,</v>

12
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.880
<v Speaker 1>I had to do it what's called a work</v>
<v Speaker 1>permit for lapd because I worked for</v>

14
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:37.560
<v Speaker 1>lapd back in 1993,</v>
<v Speaker 1>93,</v>

15
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 94.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was because I was going to</v>

16
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>referee the second UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was March 11th,</v>

17
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>in 1994.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me to actually work,</v>

18
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>the department has to allow me to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to ask for permission and then</v>

19
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>they have to grant that permission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there a concern that it was too</v>

20
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>outrageous?</v>

21
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.450
<v Speaker 1>So that was part of the whole thing is I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to say,</v>

22
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got two guys going into a cage.</v>

23
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>They're going to beat the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

24
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I put was a martial</v>
<v Speaker 1>arts referee.</v>

25
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

26
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>And then they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

27
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>what kind of martial arts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wrote mixed martial arts referee.</v>

28
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Now I can tell you that that was in 90</v>
<v Speaker 1>right at the end of [inaudible] 93 a</v>

29
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get it from anywhere other than</v>

30
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting there trying to think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that there was a</v>

31
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>columnist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sports writer from the La Times that</v>

32
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:35.331
<v Speaker 1>wrote about the very first UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in his article wrote mixed martial</v>

33
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

34
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:38.150
<v Speaker 1>so maybe it was him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

35
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got John Perretti saying that</v>

36
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 1>he did it back in 1983 it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

38
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>well if no one's saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean shit.</v>

39
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.253
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.700
<v Speaker 1>So the truth of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so peretti might have said it in</v>

41
00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 83 he might've said it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't mean anything because the</v>

42
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:57.870
<v Speaker 1>fact of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't matter what I wrote,</v>

43
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.820
<v Speaker 1>what matters is when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 1>when you joined it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you joined the UFC,</v>

45
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 1>it was still considered no holds barred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>NHB.</v>

46
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was what we called and it was</v>

47
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>something that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

48
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably part of my problem with</v>

49
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Campbell Mclaren is back at you before</v>
<v Speaker 1>ufc too,</v>

50
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

51
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>They had them on Good Morning America</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Jim Brown and you go back to that</v>

52
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:25.070
<v Speaker 1>and he came up with the line that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could win by knockout,</v>

53
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>tap out or death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

54
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.220
<v Speaker 1>And four years after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in court having that thrown in my</v>

55
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>face by the fricking attorneys trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put us down saying,</v>

56
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.580
<v Speaker 1>isn't this what your company's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

57
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>that's not what my cock fighting.</v>

58
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what an idiot said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

59
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>And so he still to this day thinks he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was magnificent with that.</v>

60
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.520
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of a shamanic ceremony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it wouldn't be a problem at all.</v>

62
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all one thing getting fucked up.</v>

63
00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Shamonic whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you taking drugs and you fucked up,</v>

64
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>you fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if it's shamonic or</v>

65
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:03.651
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

66
00:03:03.651 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>if you get high and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that and the tweaks,</v>

67
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>that little thing in my brain that goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

68
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:11.690
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember in your brain,</v>

69
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.200
<v Speaker 1>I got high for 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

70
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm from the 60s with the best of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got high and it took them down.</v>

71
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them.</v>

72
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>You came through it remarkably unscathed</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it.</v>

73
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you God.</v>

74
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you God.</v>

75
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Thank you God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about that one.</v>

76
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about that.</v>

77
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>We could talk for two hours about times</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did shit and almost died.</v>

78
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>So sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

79
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:41.700
<v Speaker 1>and then I could also tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

80
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>how many times I took shit and wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>

81
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening to this guitar lick that</v>

82
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Joe's playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did an interview here with you,</v>

83
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't tell you how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking sleepy would play these rifts.</v>

84
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>And I come down the hallway because as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it,</v>

85
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>of course not as ac it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as I see it,</v>

86
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 1>we were up in New England and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing at a place and I mowed the lawn,</v>

87
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.250
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

88
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents place.</v>

89
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 1>And I quit my last band and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking a Lou who saw her.</v>

90
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>I was crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was no more bands.</v>

91
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 1>The dream was over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He drives up in an mg,</v>

92
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.730
<v Speaker 1>we go and he's playing that night.</v>

93
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God this happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we decided to move down to</v>

94
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all in an apartment because I</v>

95
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>thought I knew why those bands didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it.</v>

96
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 1>But I knew in my heart did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had a borrowed a band,</v>

97
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>like a mic and a keith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the kinks,</v>

98
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.780
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

99
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ray,</v>

100
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 1>any of those bands they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>

101
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

102
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>it was two guys that were really tight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feed off each other.</v>

103
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:51.400
<v Speaker 1>The Fed off each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

104
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.070
<v Speaker 1>So we moved down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got really tight with Joe [inaudible].</v>

105
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.440
<v Speaker 1>I hear him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd get,</v>

106
00:04:56.441 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 1>we'd get so swept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were so stoned on booze,</v>

107
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>boone's farm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when we fucking her,</v>

108

109
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 1>What'd you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

110
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>but he would play these licks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so fucking for every song you've</v>

111
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>ever heard.</v>

00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>And so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were we going with this?</v>

119
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:35.890
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>

120
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 1>that's what these songs came from and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff would come out of my head while I</v>

121
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:44.701
<v Speaker 1>was like sweet [inaudible] low tion</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

122
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:46.391
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>get me paid paper and pen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write that shit down suddenly.</v>

124
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the radio.</v>

125
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.140
<v Speaker 1>So I use that place you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to,</v>

126
00:05:56.141 --> 00:05:58.690
<v Speaker 1>when you eat edibles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a ride?</v>

127
00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:01.320
<v Speaker 1>So many routines when you in animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there you go.</v>

128
00:06:01.321 --> 00:06:01.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

129
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well and also check this out.</v>

130
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.080
<v Speaker 1>The best part of it is when I got sober,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started right.</v>

131
00:06:08.081 --> 00:06:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Even even better shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go in a room with four guys and say</v>

132
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>we're going into right ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to say in his fucking room</v>

133
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>until we do or until we can't stand each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other smell.</v>

134
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.700
<v Speaker 1>And we would leave in seven hours with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking song and a good one and one that</v>

135
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 1>would live way past all of us.</v>

136
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.300
<v Speaker 2>Check that shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a lot of damage.</v>

137
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 2>What can be done is the ideas can die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ideas of,</v>

138
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.680
<v Speaker 2>of fascism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideas of racism,</v>

139
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:38.550
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

140
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.260
<v Speaker 2>those things we can kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

141
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are those ideas,</v>

142
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.670
<v Speaker 2>are those ideas being fostered and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>in these communities?</v>

143
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

144
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.230
<v Speaker 2>They're being cultivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

145
00:06:52.231 --> 00:06:53.910
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's like you experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

146
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I'm a white guy,</v>

147
00:06:55.891 --> 00:06:58.080
<v Speaker 2>white guy walking down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

148
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.340
<v Speaker 2>I am a higher degree than the locals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

149
00:07:02.341 --> 00:07:04.830
<v Speaker 2>like I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go and shop in some places that</v>

150
00:07:04.831 --> 00:07:06.890
<v Speaker 2>they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go in and sit down and,</v>

151
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:09.000
<v Speaker 2>and have a meal in some places that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>

152
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.490
<v Speaker 2>I cannot be greeted on the street and</v>
<v Speaker 2>good Morgan,</v>

<v Speaker 2>not the brown dude next to me.</v>

155
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.090

<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

157
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.930
<v Speaker 2>That's not allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they basically created these little</v>

158
00:07:24.931 --> 00:07:26.730
<v Speaker 2>colonies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's years.</v>

163
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.300

<v Speaker 2>it that Joseph Mengele died on a beach.</v>

164

166
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:45.900
<v Speaker 2>that would hurts me cause he's a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>like me just on the ops cause he,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and he's a special operations guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was an ss.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he was a physical specimen,</v>

170
00:07:50.611 --> 00:07:51.660
<v Speaker 2>especially for the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

171
00:07:51.661 --> 00:07:53.570
<v Speaker 2>like we didn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was,</v>

172
00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:57.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a very early on into the,</v>

173
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.780
<v Speaker 2>one of the first real Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this isn't okay.</v>

174
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:05.250
<v Speaker 2>All of Germany's going this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The chancellor is Adolf Hitler.</v>

175
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:09.270
<v Speaker 2>This is where we're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of just have to go along and you</v>

<v Speaker 2>44.</v>

178
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's okay.</v>

179
00:08:14.221 --> 00:08:16.620
<v Speaker 2>We might be losing this war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's not so in vogue,</v>

180
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 2>but when you got guys in like 1939 that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are talking eugenics and um,</v>

181
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.110

185
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.010
<v Speaker 2>but he's massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be a pretty good fight.</v>

186
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
