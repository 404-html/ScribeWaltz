00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 2>on a gorgeous rooftop rooftop villa with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pool.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the yacht.</v>

67
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 2>They've got all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they've got this down.</v>

68
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Our face painted on embryo.</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a yacht and you got beautiful women </v>

72
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.690
<v Speaker 2>standing around jazz music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you get involved?</v>

73
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 2>A little bit harder out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Brown here.</v>

74
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just saw that he was uh,</v>

75
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 2>arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

76
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 2>I um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I turned on the TV yesterday at noon and</v>

77
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 2>this is the first I'd heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a standoff at his house and I </v>

78
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

79
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Like Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is this?</v>

80
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 2>So apparently they had been there since </v>
<v Speaker 2>3:00</v>

81
00:03:55.421 --> 00:04:00.421
<v Speaker 2>in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they'd already been there for nine </v>

82
00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:00.421
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

83
00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

84
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have a warrant but they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounding his house and the helicopter</v>

85
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 2>footage of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the shown it on the news,</v>

86
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 2>helicopters circling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Brown's house,</v>

87
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 2>cops all down the driveway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lives on a cul de sac.</v>

88
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 2>So there's all these cops all lined up </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the street.</v>

89
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Cops everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a ton of cops.</v>

90
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 2>Like they're responding like this is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>armed dangerous guy.</v>

91
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Like they would any other armed </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous guy.</v>

92
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 2>And it's just him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just him and apparently some girl,</v>

93
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 2>he might've had some friends at home </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them,</v>

94
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:33.001
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pretty sure it was just him and </v>

95
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 2>he said they were at some party or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that and the girl said he</v>

96
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 2>pulled a gun on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He pulled the gun on her and um,</v>

97
00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 2>so I guess she called the cops and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

98
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.870
<v Speaker 2>there was more people there that had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story I heard was that a friend of his </v>

99
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 2>had a bunch of jewelry out and party </v>
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>

100
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Her and her friend went to look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>jewelry when they start asking about the</v>

101
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:51.690
<v Speaker 2>jewelry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris freaked out on him and said,</v>

102
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of my house.</v>

103
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to girls here anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of his friends grabbed her phone</v>

104
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:56.850
<v Speaker 2>and tried to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>

105
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna give it back to you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sign an NDA.</v>

106
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 2>And then she said she wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snatched her phone around.</v>

107
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Now this was according to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That too.</v>

108
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:07.270
<v Speaker 2>So it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard out there for a pimp.</v>

109
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All around.</v>

110
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She all around,</v>

111
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:10.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

112
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:15.511
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you say about something like </v>

113
00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:16.861
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck really happened and </v>

114
00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:16.861
<v Speaker 2>why is your friend showing jewelry?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her house.</v>

115
00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean every detail of it is twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also stupid.</v>

116
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 2>So he makes a ton of videos and puts </v>
<v Speaker 2>them on instagram.</v>

117
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Chris Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Here was an issue with.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There was a guy like wildlife videos.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like 15 feet long.</v>

170
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:47.951
<v Speaker 2>Enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put it up on my facebook because I </v>

171
00:07:47.951 --> 00:07:49.400
<v Speaker 2>just retweeted like a youtube video that</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody posted up or I'll put a link up</v>

172
00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 2>to elect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check this shit out.</v>

173
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:55.570
<v Speaker 2>That's all he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't upload it to facebook and </v>

174
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:55.940
<v Speaker 2>facebook took my account down for like </v>
<v Speaker 2>three days.</v>

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.650
<v Speaker 2>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

176
00:07:57.651 --> 00:07:59.660

<v Speaker 2>three days.</v>

177
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 2>So what's the lesson there is somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>owns the sweet.</v>

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was correctly done.</v>

180
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:11.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe I retweeted someone who </v>

181
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.110
<v Speaker 2>had illegally put it up or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

182
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the full details of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I retweet shit constantly when </v>

183
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.190
<v Speaker 2>people send me something that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

184
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.920
<v Speaker 2>I would want to see this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I sent it to everybody.</v>

185
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:20.330
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

186
00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:22.400
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't penalize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Retweet.</v>

187
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:27.430
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe I put a link up to the </v>

188
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.361
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I definitely didn't upload the </v>

189
00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:31.361
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody else's video.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and it's got more than $20 million hits.</v>

194
00:08:38.181 --> 00:08:43.181

195
00:08:43.181 --> 00:08:45.311
<v Speaker 2>popular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they can make a fuck load of </v>

347
00:16:22.221 --> 00:16:26.300

348
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.080
<v Speaker 4>he's already got the ball and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>running ahead and so they can.</v>

349
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.480
<v Speaker 4>They probably get around in about two </v>

406
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:15.980
<v Speaker 4>And then he hits one out of bounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like over a fence into the woods and he </v>

407
00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:15.980
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>

<v Speaker 6>He can't get in his car.</v>

466
00:21:42.811 --> 00:21:44.370
<v Speaker 6>I'd be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd be like,</v>

467
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:46.540
<v Speaker 6>sky like represents authority.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

468
00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.660
<v Speaker 6>he just let him go.</v>

469
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:53.930
<v Speaker 6>I probably would let them go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I couldn't believe that will let </v>

470
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.930
<v Speaker 6>them go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

471
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:56.310
<v Speaker 6>there was a bunch of people around and </v>
<v Speaker 6>people getting upset because him and the</v>

472
00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.520
<v Speaker 6>guy with thrown water each other and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they were almost getting people so </v>

473
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.700
<v Speaker 6>people start getting upset,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so there was this air of tension in the </v>

474
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:04.920
<v Speaker 6>air and then the valley came and the guy</v>
<v Speaker 6>got in his car and we were like,</v>

475
00:22:04.921 --> 00:22:06.120
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>should we stop that?</v>

476
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.370
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she'd stopped that guy from getting in a</v>

477
00:22:08.371 --> 00:22:09.100
<v Speaker 6>car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

478
00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:12.120
<v Speaker 6>it's like a judgment call.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He might have just been an idiot.</v>

479
00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.000
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever taken someone's case?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

480
00:22:15.001 --> 00:22:17.820
<v Speaker 6>I've advised people to not drink or not </v>
<v Speaker 6>drive rather.</v>

481
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.950
<v Speaker 6>I've definitely done that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I have not taken any keys.</v>

482
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:24.870

<v Speaker 6>but I've seen some shit man.</v>

<v Speaker 7>her not wanting him to drive.</v>

488
00:22:34.941 --> 00:22:39.680
<v Speaker 7>He'd be fucked up and I remember him </v>
<v Speaker 7>driving us home one night.</v>

489

<v Speaker 7>My mom was screaming at him before we </v>
<v Speaker 7>got in and then it was like a </v>

<v Speaker 7>view mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was like going over curbs.</v>

496
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.621
<v Speaker 7>crying and I remember the next day he </v>
<v Speaker 7>came down to the TV room and he </v>

497
00:23:02.621 --> 00:23:03.050
<v Speaker 7>apologized and then he quit drinking for</v>
<v Speaker 7>like</v>

498
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.540
<v Speaker 6>maybe two months.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 6>He would go through that grip of that </v>

503
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.870
<v Speaker 6>fucking alcoholic people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>native Americans,</v>

504
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.270
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right grip on them.</v>

505
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:28.010
<v Speaker 6>I haven't had it fully explained to me </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I've read it both ways.</v>

506
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:33.160
<v Speaker 6>I've read that there was some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>genetic propensity towards alcoholism </v>

507
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.050
<v Speaker 6>that they had because the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 6>alcohol was not normal to them,</v>

508
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:37.970
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't something they had in their </v>
<v Speaker 6>diet all the time.</v>

509
00:23:37.971 --> 00:23:40.910
<v Speaker 6>So they didn't have the enzymes or </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever it was to break it down.</v>

510
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.320
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the liver,</v>

511
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.810
<v Speaker 6>the liver is different the way they.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've heard.</v>

512
00:23:44.811 --> 00:23:46.120
<v Speaker 6>That's how</v>

513
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.660
<v Speaker 2>real are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether that's bullshit.</v>

514
00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:49.420
<v Speaker 2>It's just cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

515
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:51.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who's right,</v>

516
00:23:51.021 --> 00:23:51.830
<v Speaker 2>it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

517
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.550
<v Speaker 2>It's undeniable that certain cultures </v>
<v Speaker 2>like ours,</v>

518
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.420
<v Speaker 2>like the Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Italians have a lot of alcoholism.</v>

519
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

520
00:23:59.781 --> 00:24:00.830
<v Speaker 2>part of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

521
00:24:00.831 --> 00:24:03.920
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italians and Irish are both Catholics.</v>

522
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:07.910
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of repression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of shame and um,</v>

523
00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

524
00:24:09.181 --> 00:24:14.181
<v Speaker 2>when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people act out and I think </v>

525
00:24:14.181 --> 00:24:14.181
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

526
00:24:14.181 --> 00:24:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Italians have living under fascism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

527

<v Speaker 2>talking to a neuroscientist about race </v>

583
00:26:35.831 --> 00:26:35.990
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

584
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:41.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>race issues about cops shooting black </v>

585
00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:42.800
<v Speaker 2>people and Statistics see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>statistics.</v>

586
00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 2>So I don't</v>

587
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.160
<v Speaker 5>know if this is accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just knowing what I've read and I </v>

588
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:49.160
<v Speaker 5>don't know what this means,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm just going to say it.</v>

589
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:54.410
<v Speaker 5>This statistics are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people would think the cops are more </v>

590
00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:55.140
<v Speaker 5>violently shoot more black people than </v>
<v Speaker 5>white people,</v>

591
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.180
<v Speaker 5>like per capita or percentage or </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is.</v>

592
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.760
<v Speaker 5>Apparently it's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they.</v>

593
00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:04.290
<v Speaker 5>They showed this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this a study recently that shows that if</v>

594
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:06.750
<v Speaker 5>you look at the overall set,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's find out what those numbers are so</v>

595
00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:11.751
<v Speaker 5>we can talk about it and know exactly </v>
<v Speaker 5>what we're saying because this was the </v>

596
00:27:11.751 --> 00:27:14.631
<v Speaker 5>argument that other white communities </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences many shootings from cops is </v>

597
00:27:14.631 --> 00:27:18.741
<v Speaker 5>black communities essentially damning </v>
<v Speaker 5>towards like what I've always said is I </v>

598
00:27:18.741 --> 00:27:19.770
<v Speaker 5>think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think most people,</v>

599
00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 5>almost 99 percent of the people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>unqualified to be a cop.</v>

600
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.300
<v Speaker 5>I think it's an unbelievably difficult </v>
<v Speaker 5>job.</v>

601
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:28.070
<v Speaker 5>I think cops shoot people all the time </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they shouldn't shoot people that are</v>

602
00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:33.090
<v Speaker 5>dealing with 300 million plus people in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this one continent and we're looking at </v>

603
00:27:33.301 --> 00:27:38.301
<v Speaker 5>the stories of all these cops in all of </v>
<v Speaker 5>these cities and all of these counties </v>

604
00:27:38.461 --> 00:27:39.870
<v Speaker 5>and all these states,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all over the country.</v>

605
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:43.140
<v Speaker 5>You're dealing with a fucking mammoth </v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of people.</v>

606
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just because of the history of </v>

607
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.781
<v Speaker 5>racism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's more disturbing to us to think that</v>

608
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.400
<v Speaker 5>there's white cops are targeting black </v>
<v Speaker 5>kids,</v>

609
00:27:53.401 --> 00:27:56.760
<v Speaker 5>which they most certainly must be there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most certainly must be.</v>

610
00:27:56.761 --> 00:27:58.560
<v Speaker 5>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you think of the height,</v>

611
00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:03.590
<v Speaker 5>the amount of people we're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 5>there most likely is a racist or to </v>

612
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:06.420
<v Speaker 5>amongst them or or who knows how many.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

613
00:28:06.421 --> 00:28:09.450
<v Speaker 5>there's no denying it or systemic racism</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the department.</v>

614
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:14.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I feel like we're all on this </v>

615
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:17.181
<v Speaker 5>heightened sense of like conflict </v>
<v Speaker 5>because we're looking at the conflicts </v>

616
00:28:17.911 --> 00:28:22.911
<v Speaker 5>between millions of fucking people and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're an individual and we're taking in </v>

617
00:28:23.521 --> 00:28:25.290
<v Speaker 5>these numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these interactions.</v>

618
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.530
<v Speaker 5>Millions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Literally millions of people interacting</v>

619
00:28:28.531 --> 00:28:33.531
<v Speaker 5>with police officers every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's way too much for our fucking </v>

620
00:28:33.531 --> 00:28:34.710
<v Speaker 5>brains,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we start thinking,</v>

621
00:28:34.711 --> 00:28:39.711
<v Speaker 5>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cops are killing black people </v>

622
00:28:39.711 --> 00:28:39.711
<v Speaker 5>everywhere.</v>

623
00:28:39.711 --> 00:28:42.260
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>turns out does it just shooting people </v>

624
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:42.260
<v Speaker 5>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's black people and white people.</v>

625
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.630
<v Speaker 5>It's just there's been some really </v>
<v Speaker 5>damning videos of them doing it to black</v>

626
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:50.631
<v Speaker 5>people and again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's probably a lot of cops that are </v>

627
00:28:50.631 --> 00:28:54.171
<v Speaker 5>racist here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's to see these stats because I </v>

628
00:28:54.171 --> 00:28:54.330
<v Speaker 5>haven't heard anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what it was.</v>

629
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.310
<v Speaker 5>Washington Post they get really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

630
00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:58.790
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's look at the actual numbers.</v>

631
00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:00.690
<v Speaker 5>Were were the actual numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

632
00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:06.910
<v Speaker 5>Post began its police shootings project </v>
<v Speaker 5>and response to the 2014 killing of </v>

633
00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.340
<v Speaker 5>Michael Brown in Ferguson,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Missouri,</v>

634
00:29:08.341 --> 00:29:13.341
<v Speaker 5>a death that triggered days of riding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the assassination of to New York City </v>

635
00:29:13.341 --> 00:29:15.300
<v Speaker 5>police officers and a surge of support </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the black lives matter,</v>

636
00:29:15.301 --> 00:29:18.630
<v Speaker 5>protest movement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Blah ba Blah ba blah ba blah ba blah.</v>

637
00:29:18.631 --> 00:29:23.631
<v Speaker 5>As of January 15th,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the posted documented 987 victims of </v>

638
00:29:23.631 --> 00:29:28.581
<v Speaker 5>fatal police shootings in 2015 about </v>
<v Speaker 5>twice the number historically recorded </v>

639
00:29:28.581 --> 00:29:33.201
<v Speaker 5>by federal agencies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whites were 50 percent of those victims </v>

640
00:29:33.201 --> 00:29:34.950
<v Speaker 5>and blacks were 26 percent by </v>
<v Speaker 5>comparison,</v>

641
00:29:34.951 --> 00:29:38.940
<v Speaker 5>whites are 62 percent of the US </v>
<v Speaker 5>population and blacks are 13 percent.</v>

642
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.310
<v Speaker 5>The ensuing debate is largely centered </v>
<v Speaker 5>on whether the disproportionate</v>

643
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:47.310
<v Speaker 2>number of black deaths was a result of </v>
<v Speaker 2>police racism or the relatively high </v>

644
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:51.031
<v Speaker 2>rate of crime in black neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which brings black men into more </v>

645
00:29:51.031 --> 00:29:52.990
<v Speaker 2>frequent and more fraught encounters </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the police.</v>

646
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.670
<v Speaker 2>So it seems to me just looking at those </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers right there,</v>

647
00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.760
<v Speaker 2>that it says whites were 50 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those victims and blacks were 26 </v>

648
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.110
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

649
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:09.130
<v Speaker 2>that's just right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's way more white people than there</v>

650
00:30:09.131 --> 00:30:12.550
<v Speaker 2>are black people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that seems to manage you eyes.</v>

651
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:17.640
<v Speaker 2>The blacks are twice as likely if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're 13 percent of the population in </v>

652
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:22.291
<v Speaker 2>26 percent of the victims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are double a and whites are 20 </v>

653
00:30:23.531 --> 00:30:26.860
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's proportionately likely.</v>

654
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.210
<v Speaker 2>So this is in fact kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>disproving what you saying,</v>

655
00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:33.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's saying there is a trend,</v>

656
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.190
<v Speaker 2>but what they're saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it sociological?</v>

657
00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Isn't the fact that blacks were living </v>
<v Speaker 2>in dangerous neighborhoods?</v>

658
00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:42.820
<v Speaker 2>The reason why there's more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is totally logical.</v>

659
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:47.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the argument that he should </v>

660
00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:47.850
<v Speaker 2>have made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not the argument he made.</v>

661
00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:51.210
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because I didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that was what the statistics were </v>

662
00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:51.210
<v Speaker 2>and I wish I knew that going into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

663
00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:55.270
<v Speaker 2>I've obviously had no idea we going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have this conversation or I would've.</v>

664
00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because that,</v>

665
00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can blame it on the </v>

666
00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.411
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get blamed on crime ridden </v>

667
00:31:04.411 --> 00:31:06.811
<v Speaker 2>communities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we're just going to go </v>

668
00:31:06.811 --> 00:31:08.611
<v Speaker 2>statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the statistic will then then they're </v>

669
00:31:08.611 --> 00:31:11.520
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More black people are getting shot by </v>

670
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:11.520
<v Speaker 2>cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people are getting shot by cops.</v>

671
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.811
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of fucking people get 50 </v>

672
00:31:15.811 --> 00:31:16.000
<v Speaker 2>percent in 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that a little about,</v>

673
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.430
<v Speaker 2>dude?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

674
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.630
<v Speaker 2>It's just terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like this whole gun issue,</v>

675
00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:24.100
<v Speaker 2>it didn't use to be an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

676
00:31:24.101 --> 00:31:29.101
<v Speaker 2>that the NRA used to be like a hunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization and people just own guns </v>

677
00:31:29.101 --> 00:31:33.550
<v Speaker 2>and it wasn't a big deal and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>made it a political issue and now I feel</v>

678
00:31:33.551 --> 00:31:36.700
<v Speaker 2>like there's almost like a gun coveting.</v>

679
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:41.700
<v Speaker 2>I think there's more people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous that are getting guns and I </v>

680
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.860
<v Speaker 2>think the police are probably responding</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>

681
00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:45.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could definitely be the case.</v>

682
00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also,</v>

683
00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:52.620
<v Speaker 2>when you look at guns and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one thing that I don't think we </v>

684
00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.570
<v Speaker 2>really consider that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a gun industry,</v>

685
00:31:55.750 --> 00:32:00.750
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Within their manufacturing guns </v>

686
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.690
<v Speaker 2>constantly and they're manufacturing </v>
<v Speaker 2>them for civilians and they can use them</v>

687
00:32:03.851 --> 00:32:08.851
<v Speaker 2>legally and they can own them legally </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's the right and people exercise </v>

688
00:32:08.851 --> 00:32:13.681
<v Speaker 2>that Second Amendment right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they have a lot of guns and this </v>

689
00:32:13.681 --> 00:32:14.890
<v Speaker 2>business keeps me guns and there's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guns.</v>

690
00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:18.520
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guns was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at one point in time,</v>

691
00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.500
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have fucking guns all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the place.</v>

692
00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:25.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean the world's going to be safer </v>
<v Speaker 2>because no one's going to be shooting </v>

693
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:25.740
<v Speaker 2>people because everyone's going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a gun.</v>

694
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Because if I think of America as many </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns as there are people right now,</v>

695
00:32:29.201 --> 00:32:31.060
<v Speaker 2>I think there's more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

696
00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:32.330
<v Speaker 2>I think there's more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

697
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:37.580
<v Speaker 2>we'll find that out because I think it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was one of those things where they were </v>

698
00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:37.630
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers switched over.</v>

699
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They broke up the guns of out fucked</v>

700
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.290
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's going to be like,</v>

701
00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:43.640
<v Speaker 4>everyone's going to have the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it,</v>

702
00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:44.830
<v Speaker 4>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>

703
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.070
<v Speaker 4>It's about the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roughly twice as many guns per capita as</v>

704
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:52.040
<v Speaker 4>there were in 1968.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More than 300 million guns at all.</v>

705
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.920
<v Speaker 4>So it's basically the population in one </v>
<v Speaker 4>for one.</v>

706
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.440
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many of you have.</v>

707
00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.240
<v Speaker 4>I've got a few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

708
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:05.510
<v Speaker 4>I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think about having one.</v>

709
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:10.590
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel mixed because first of all I </v>

710
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:11.770
<v Speaker 4>would feel bad as to have a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just say that right out there.</v>

711
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:17.130
<v Speaker 4>It would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would feel really fucking cool to </v>

712
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.781
<v Speaker 4>hold some steel and I'd have a safe and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I put it in the safe and that it would </v>

713
00:33:19.781 --> 00:33:23.681
<v Speaker 4>feel good to know that if shit got </v>
<v Speaker 4>really bad that I'd be able to go out </v>

714
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.820
<v Speaker 4>and kill the people that have the food </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the water.</v>

715
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:30.600
<v Speaker 4>Or yourself or.</v>

<v Speaker 4>gun in your mouth if someone's coming </v>

738
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.300

740
00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:24.330
<v Speaker 2>I write shit all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write shit all the time,</v>

741
00:34:24.331 --> 00:34:25.560
<v Speaker 2>like in the middle of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go through.</v>

742
00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:30.570
<v Speaker 2>I need to remember and it never comes up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get in there and I can barely read </v>

743
00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:32.190
<v Speaker 2>my own handwriting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty bad becoming.</v>

744
00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.760
<v Speaker 2>It's becoming so that handwriting seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>so stupid,</v>

745
00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.810
<v Speaker 2>like more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more quickly.</v>

746
00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.790
<v Speaker 2>Texting is so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

747
00:34:41.791 --> 00:34:46.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this schools are deciding to stop </v>

748
00:34:46.791 --> 00:34:50.151
<v Speaker 2>teaching cursive now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a shame because cursive is </v>

749
00:34:50.151 --> 00:34:51.060
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much faster.</v>

750
00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's goofy.</v>

751
00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Too many people are goofy with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll give you one of these like,</v>

752
00:34:56.671 --> 00:34:58.260
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

753
00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:03.420
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the hell do I know what that word </v>

754
00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:03.420
<v Speaker 2>is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barely made any movement.</v>

755
00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:03.540
<v Speaker 2>You Lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

756
00:35:03.541 --> 00:35:05.730
<v Speaker 2>You kind of keep sliding your hand as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're writing.</v>

757
00:35:05.731 --> 00:35:10.731
<v Speaker 2>You can't leave it there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why cursive ended because people </v>

758
00:35:10.731 --> 00:35:10.731
<v Speaker 2>were fucking lazy.</v>

759
00:35:10.731 --> 00:35:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Lazy people would write you shit and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just this,</v>

760
00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:16.200
<v Speaker 2>this dribble of ups and downs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't.</v>

761
00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Was that an end?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a you like a giant signature?</v>

762
00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.840
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a fucking ekg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so stupid.</v>

763
00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:27.610
<v Speaker 2>It's needs to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to know what an.</v>

764
00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.880
<v Speaker 2>Is that an we'll make it look like in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

765
00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:35.040
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't be left to your interpretation </v>

766
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:35.040
<v Speaker 2>of what an a should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you make a tea,</v>

767
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.690
<v Speaker 2>cross it where the fucking t is not it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't put the eye over the L.</v>

768
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:42.560
<v Speaker 2>is there an eye over now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>

769
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Like if the dots should be above the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stem of the eye,</v>

770
00:35:45.241 --> 00:35:46.020
<v Speaker 2>but there's always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

771
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.290
<v Speaker 2>so he's at the letter next to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

772
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:54.440
<v Speaker 2>What about like in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody ever put the eye under the </v>

773
00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.460
<v Speaker 2>lower k over the lower case?</v>
<v Speaker 2>J.</v>

774
00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.360
<v Speaker 2>Did they do that anymore?</v>

775
00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:58.410
<v Speaker 2>It was a door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make that up.</v>

776
00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:03.000
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a dot over lowercase j.</v>

777
00:36:03.001 --> 00:36:03.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

778
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:05.730
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

779
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Writing something by hand.</v>

780
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.700
<v Speaker 2>You'd put a dot over the lowercase j.</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

781
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's barely knew you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to do it.</v>

782
00:36:15.961 --> 00:36:17.340
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I had to ask.</v>

783
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.340
<v Speaker 2>I was questioning it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew it.</v>

784
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:21.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that's how it would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm like,</v>

785
00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:23.340
<v Speaker 2>who does that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

786
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.230
<v Speaker 2>he got a deal it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

787
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:29.310
<v Speaker 2>you're a stickler for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like maybe because I grew up</v>

788
00:36:29.311 --> 00:36:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Catholic and penmanship was actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big deal.</v>

789
00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually very serious and they </v>

790
00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:37.120
<v Speaker 2>might not even know you're an emmy award</v>
<v Speaker 2>winning writer.</v>

791
00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.000
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how they give out the emmys.</v>

792
00:36:39.001 --> 00:36:40.350
<v Speaker 2>They look at your penmanship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

793
00:36:40.351 --> 00:36:42.480
<v Speaker 2>they go all writer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

794

<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

795
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to know how to put that out </v>

796
00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:50.460
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird when you look at Russian,</v>

797
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.410
<v Speaker 2>if you look at any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

798
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:56.500
<v Speaker 2>like I follow a lot of Russian athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I follow their instagram pages and I </v>

799
00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:56.500
<v Speaker 2>looked at the rug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mars.</v>

800
00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Now that might as well be from Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's up with all these fake letters?</v>

801
00:36:59.881 --> 00:37:02.970
<v Speaker 2>You guys go like this jumble of how did </v>
<v Speaker 2>this happen?</v>

802
00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Is so shitty at communicating that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>let all these different styles of </v>

803
00:37:08.851 --> 00:37:11.400
<v Speaker 2>language exist to the point where none </v>
<v Speaker 2>of us can.</v>

804
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like the Tower of Babel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you.</v>

805
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:21.430
<v Speaker 2>We will have one language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question man.</v>

806
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Look at all the weird shit they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that boomerang above the backwards </v>

807
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.620
<v Speaker 2>in like what the fight is going on up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

808
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:31.890
<v Speaker 2>And how about the other one that looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a red dragons.</v>

809
00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:36.100
<v Speaker 2>Like the Jason Ellis logo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something there.</v>

810
00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.770

<v Speaker 2>It's a 19 year old girl who's 19 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up in Europe.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They have a different attitude and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly shave.</v>

822
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean how much more could have been </v>

823
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:05.200
<v Speaker 2>done a long time ago if we all spoke one</v>
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>

824
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.490
<v Speaker 2>the Tower of Babel Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although obviously it's great.</v>

825
00:38:08.491 --> 00:38:10.680
<v Speaker 2>What's the Tower of Babel story from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bible?</v>

826
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Didn't rate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you?</v>

827
00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Catholic.</v>

828
00:38:14.431 --> 00:38:16.770
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a Catholic for a year.</v>

829
00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Tower of Babel is the whole thing</v>

830
00:38:21.091 --> 00:38:26.091
<v Speaker 2>about it was that there's all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different languages and that there was </v>

831
00:38:26.091 --> 00:38:29.181
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go to the actual official </v>

832
00:38:29.181 --> 00:38:29.190
<v Speaker 2>definition because I'm going to fuck it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

833
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:34.580
<v Speaker 2>but that one of the ways to keep us from</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding each other was to give us </v>

834
00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:35.380
<v Speaker 2>so many different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't communicate with each other.</v>

835
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

836
00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.430
<v Speaker 6>What does this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's the myth?</v>

837
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.720
<v Speaker 6>Find out where the meth is here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Young tram according to the story,</v>

838
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:48.780
<v Speaker 6>a united humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There it is a united humanity for the </v>

839
00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:53.070
<v Speaker 6>generations following the great floods,</v>
<v Speaker 6>speaking in a single language and </v>

840
00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:54.340
<v Speaker 6>migrating from the east came to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>land.</v>

841
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:56.930
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is it going further?</v>

842
00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:02.240
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Team two came to the land of Shinara </v>

843
00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:05.790
<v Speaker 6>Shin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She say that Shannara Shannara there,</v>

844
00:39:06.171 --> 00:39:09.650
<v Speaker 6>they agreed to build a city and a tower </v>
<v Speaker 6>tall enough to reach heaven.</v>

845
00:39:09.651 --> 00:39:12.920
<v Speaker 6>Seeing this God confounded their speech</v>

846
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:19.000
<v Speaker 6>so that they could no longer understand </v>
<v Speaker 6>each other and scattered them around the</v>

847
00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:20.670
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's the idea of.</v>

848
00:39:20.671 --> 00:39:23.560
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's basically an acknowledgement</v>

849
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:27.250
<v Speaker 6>of how much could be accomplished if we </v>
<v Speaker 6>could all speak the same language,</v>

850
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.400
<v Speaker 6>but we're all still like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is my culture man.</v>

851
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.710
<v Speaker 6>Like this is my culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is who I'm,</v>

852
00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:34.870
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not abandoning this.</v>

853
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:40.470
<v Speaker 6>We all have this sense of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of clannish like Flemish </v>

854
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.220
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like this.</v>

855
00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.280
<v Speaker 6>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>A hollins?</v>

856
00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:45.630
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

857
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:50.700
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Netherlands than Flemish Dutch speak</v>

858
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:53.050
<v Speaker 6>Dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Dutch people speak Flemish.</v>

859
00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.730
<v Speaker 6>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then they live in the Netherlands,</v>

860
00:39:55.420 --> 00:40:00.220
<v Speaker 6>which is also called Holland with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck is a lot of different names.</v>

861
00:40:00.221 --> 00:40:01.540
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Flemish.</v>

862
00:40:01.541 --> 00:40:03.010
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gregory's correct.</v>

863
00:40:03.011 --> 00:40:08.011
<v Speaker 6>The Dutch language spoken in Flanders,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the two official languages of </v>

864
00:40:08.011 --> 00:40:09.130
<v Speaker 6>Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Huh?</v>

865
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:14.370
<v Speaker 6>The people flenders and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have to speak three languages </v>

866
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:15.940
<v Speaker 6>because they got England next to them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They get France next to them.</v>

867
00:40:15.941 --> 00:40:16.890
<v Speaker 6>They get what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hold on,</v>

868
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:19.210
<v Speaker 6>Jeremy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was confusing.</v>

869
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:24.510
<v Speaker 6>It says it's spoken in Flanders,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the two official languages of </v>

870
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:25.690
<v Speaker 6>Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's Belgium is not Holland.</v>

871
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:29.500
<v Speaker 6>So what the fuck did we screw it up?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think we screwed it up.</v>

872
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:30.490
<v Speaker 6>Or the Dutch.</v>

873
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.600
<v Speaker 6>It says it's a variety of Dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

874
00:40:35.601 --> 00:40:40.601
<v Speaker 6>Here's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Flemish also called Flemish Dutch </v>

875
00:40:40.601 --> 00:40:43.540
<v Speaker 6>Belgium dust and slash or southern Dutch</v>
<v Speaker 6>refers to the varieties of the Dutch </v>

876
00:40:44.421 --> 00:40:47.420
<v Speaker 6>language spoken in Flanders,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the northern part of Belgium.</v>

877
00:40:47.421 --> 00:40:50.510
<v Speaker 6>The turn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Flemish is used at least five ways.</v>

878
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:52.250
<v Speaker 6>It seems like it's all in Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

879
00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:55.250
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what do people in Holland speak?</v>

880
00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.810
<v Speaker 6>I think they speak Dutch people in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Holland that probably so mad at us now.</v>

881
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:03.230
<v Speaker 6>And fucking idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have to watch your stupid elections.</v>

882
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:04.850
<v Speaker 6>You don't even know what language we </v>
<v Speaker 6>speak.</v>

883
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:12.370
<v Speaker 6>The whole world knows that Donald Trump </v>
<v Speaker 6>and Hillary Clinton are claw each </v>

884
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:15.170
<v Speaker 6>other's eyes out to become the president</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we don't know their language.</v>

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:18.230
<v Speaker 6>They speak,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they speak Dutch.</v>

886
00:41:18.231 --> 00:41:22.470
<v Speaker 6>And why does that one Frisians for CN </v>
<v Speaker 6>poppy?</v>

887
00:41:22.471 --> 00:41:24.900
<v Speaker 6>A meadow puppy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A mento?</v>

<v Speaker 6>Lebanon,</v>

890
00:41:27.811 --> 00:41:31.640
<v Speaker 6>South Africa and they speak Dutch there </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they've,</v>

891
00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:31.860
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

892
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

893
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.160
<v Speaker 2>they fucked up South Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

894
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:39.100
<v Speaker 2>They came in hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such,</v>

895
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:44.170
<v Speaker 2>it's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird when you look at like the </v>

896
00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 2>pockets of white people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when apartheid was kicking.</v>

897
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you look at how bizarre that </v>

898
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:53.531
<v Speaker 2>must've been like these white racist </v>
<v Speaker 2>people living in South Africa surrounded</v>

899
00:41:54.771 --> 00:41:58.250
<v Speaker 2>by black people and they came over on </v>
<v Speaker 2>boats essentially.</v>

900
00:41:58.251 --> 00:42:03.230
<v Speaker 2>They're like the last of one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>colony expansion experiments.</v>

901
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went to Africa,</v>

902
00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The British had already been there.</v>

903
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:10.280
<v Speaker 2>I think the French might've been there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Dutch were the ones that came in</v>

904
00:42:10.281 --> 00:42:13.490
<v Speaker 2>and just fucking dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn the screws.</v>

905
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if there was an Africa to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa,</v>

906
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:17.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look,</v>

907
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:18.560
<v Speaker 2>we look at Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

908
00:42:18.561 --> 00:42:19.760
<v Speaker 2>And we go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

909
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Like that's where civilization began.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:27.251
<v Speaker 2>there's fucking lions and people are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mussai warriors and running around with </v>

911
00:42:27.251 --> 00:42:31.391
<v Speaker 2>spears have to kill a lion to be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all dancing around the fire and </v>

912
00:42:31.391 --> 00:42:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Tanzania and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

913
00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:37.580
<v Speaker 2>this is a window to a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 2>world like Africa itself.</v>

914
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:39.860
<v Speaker 2>What if there was a place even fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy?</v>

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:47.020
<v Speaker 2>You pass Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Africans went to the dark lands and </v>

916
00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.230
<v Speaker 2>there's just monsters tearing each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart,</v>

917
00:42:48.231 --> 00:42:53.231
<v Speaker 2>left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing survived more than a few </v>

918
00:42:53.231 --> 00:42:55.391
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's just fucking and killing </v>

919
00:42:55.391 --> 00:42:56.840
<v Speaker 2>and it's just chaos and blaming bends in</v>
<v Speaker 2>half,</v>

920
00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:01.870
<v Speaker 2>eating their babies as they come out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the womb and bandits dressed like like </v>

921
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:03.770
<v Speaker 2>human dumpsters with machine guns </v>
<v Speaker 2>running around,</v>

922
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:08.800
<v Speaker 2>blowing each other up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was every things bulletproof and on </v>

923
00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:14.100
<v Speaker 2>fire and then Africa is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go over to fucking cozy.</v>

924
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

925
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.450
<v Speaker 2>Those people are looking at the Africans</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going like,</v>

926
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.710
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Better than the rock we're using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

930
00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:30.720
<v Speaker 2>There's this one episode of this show </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I watched called Jim shockey's </v>

931
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:34.681
<v Speaker 2>uncharted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's this guy who goes to all these </v>

932
00:43:34.681 --> 00:43:36.640
<v Speaker 2>different parts of the world and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional hunter and he goes to these</v>

933
00:43:36.641 --> 00:43:41.641
<v Speaker 2>places and sometimes they eradicate like</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous animals that are threatening </v>

934
00:43:41.641 --> 00:43:41.641
<v Speaker 2>villages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

935
00:43:41.641 --> 00:43:43.780
<v Speaker 2>and one of the episodes he went to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>village,</v>

936
00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:47.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what part of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of the Congo it was,</v>

937
00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:52.860
<v Speaker 2>but they have these giant saltwater </v>
<v Speaker 2>crocodiles at eight people all the time </v>

938
00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:58.100
<v Speaker 2>and while they were there willing got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>no shit while they were there filming </v>

939

958
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:46.110
<v Speaker 2>It's protected because we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough monsters and we liked him to keep</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

966
00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:02.600
<v Speaker 2>it's a shame because when you see what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening to sharks,</v>

967
00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:04.590
<v Speaker 2>they kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget the numbers.</v>

968
00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:07.230
<v Speaker 2>It's something like 3 million sharks a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

969
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

00:45:08.011 --> 00:45:13.011
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like that's fucking crate and </v>

971
00:45:13.011 --> 00:45:16.481
<v Speaker 2>they're harmless animals to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dislike for deaths a year in the world </v>

972
00:45:16.481 --> 00:45:21.351
<v Speaker 2>from shark by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why am I putting all these statistics </v>

973
00:45:21.351 --> 00:45:21.351
<v Speaker 2>out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's,</v>

974
00:45:21.351 --> 00:45:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're far off though.</v>

975
00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:24.330

<v Speaker 2>but I don't remember what the number </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

977
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:28.530

<v Speaker 2>year from sharks,</v>

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.980
<v Speaker 4>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you didn't do anything?</v>

1044
00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:41.880
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1045
00:48:41.881 --> 00:48:43.140
<v Speaker 4>So you have malaria?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

1046
00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:48.640
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't you see how small my look at the </v>

1047
00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.121
<v Speaker 4>head funds are practically touching that</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zika stuff,</v>

1048
00:48:52.831 --> 00:48:57.831
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the big danger now is not the </v>

1049
00:48:57.831 --> 00:49:00.501
<v Speaker 4>mosquitoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that it's a sexually transmitted </v>

1050
00:49:00.501 --> 00:49:02.880
<v Speaker 4>disease and they say it's infection rate</v>
<v Speaker 4>is about the same as aids was.</v>

1051
00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:04.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1052
00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:11.060
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well there's areas in Miami now where </v>

1053
00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:12.090
<v Speaker 6>they're thinking about like cordoning </v>
<v Speaker 6>off blocks and shit.</v>

1054
00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:13.040
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1055
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.290
<v Speaker 4>Because they saw mosquitoes there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1056
00:49:15.291 --> 00:49:18.770
<v Speaker 4>Because they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've so many cases of Zika.</v>

1057
00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.670
<v Speaker 4>Damn Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's growler too because they don't have</v>

1058
00:49:22.671 --> 00:49:25.100
<v Speaker 4>a vaccine and they say they're years </v>
<v Speaker 4>away from a vaccine.</v>

1059
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:32.750
<v Speaker 6>So this one day there's gonna be some </v>
<v Speaker 6>insurmountable biological threat to </v>

1060
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:37.651
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one day is going to be some some dark</v>

1061
00:49:37.991 --> 00:49:42.991
<v Speaker 6>wave that sweeps across the population </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then there's going to be a </v>

1062
00:49:42.991 --> 00:49:43.170
<v Speaker 6>rebuilding process.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1063
00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:47.740
<v Speaker 6>It's just happened so many times with so</v>
<v Speaker 6>many different things too,</v>

1064
00:49:47.741 --> 00:49:52.741
<v Speaker 6>like it doesn't necessarily have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And this is not something to freak out </v>

1065
00:49:52.741 --> 00:49:52.741
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but just to put it in perspective,</v>

1066
00:49:52.741 --> 00:49:57.570
<v Speaker 6>there's been so many fucking times where</v>
<v Speaker 6>something's happened,</v>

1067
00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:03.330
<v Speaker 6>whether it's some gigantic event,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a super volcano or diseases or just</v>

1068
00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:07.310
<v Speaker 6>giant chunks of the population just </v>
<v Speaker 6>died.</v>

1069
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:10.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1070
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:15.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's theories about it that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's population control stuff that's </v>

1071
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.850
<v Speaker 4>built in and it can manifest itself as </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease,</v>

1072
00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:23.330
<v Speaker 4>natural disasters or war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the population is kept in check.</v>

1073
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it just,</v>

1074
00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 4>that's just the system that</v>

1075
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:33.070
<v Speaker 2>nature runs on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just finds a way to exploit any </v>

1076
00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:33.070
<v Speaker 2>weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the numbers get too high,</v>

1077
00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:35.390
<v Speaker 2>there's more weaknesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nature finds a way,</v>

1078
00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.880
<v Speaker 2>develops a strong attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it gets in there.</v>

1079
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:41.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like this little fucking Ping Pong </v>
<v Speaker 2>match game that's going on.</v>

1080
00:50:41.361 --> 00:50:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Constantly adjustments and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine.</v>

1081
00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:48.350
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of scientists are fucking shake </v>
<v Speaker 2>in test tubes.</v>

1082
00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Find the disease all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

1083
00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:53.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's pressure.</v>

1084
00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:58.940
<v Speaker 7>That's a long day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean you think about people that work </v>

1085
00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:01.101
<v Speaker 7>long hours when you're a scientist </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's trying to break the code on a </v>

1086
00:51:01.101 --> 00:51:01.740
<v Speaker 7>fucking vaccine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Could be,</v>

1087
00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:07.130
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like we would like with Ebola when they </v>

1088
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.130
<v Speaker 7>were trying to figure something out.</v>

1089
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened to a bola?</v>

1090
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:09.880
<v Speaker 2>We got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got it.</v>

1091
00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:10.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got it.</v>

1092
00:51:10.601 --> 00:51:15.601
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the got Kadafi giving that to me.</v>

1093
00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:24.610
<v Speaker 2>I could have got the Kadafi video is </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the most disturbing video ever.</v>

1094
00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've ever seen it now?</v>

1095
00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do your military are in for a treat?</v>

1096
00:51:29.441 --> 00:51:31.360
<v Speaker 2>Military released it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in for a treat.</v>

1097
00:51:31.570 --> 00:51:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cell phone.</v>

1098
00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Video got released immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what happened.</v>

1099
00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:40.350
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rebels overcame and the United </v>

1100
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:40.350
<v Speaker 2>States backed rebels'.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1101
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:42.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the full history of how it </v>
<v Speaker 2>went down.</v>

1102
00:51:42.581 --> 00:51:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Do you know the full history?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that at one point we were a happy</v>

1103
00:51:45.991 --> 00:51:47.230
<v Speaker 2>back Kadafi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1104
00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:52.410
<v Speaker 2>So they have Gadhafi this is him dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's video of him where they have</v>

1105
00:51:53.801 --> 00:51:55.510
<v Speaker 2>them and they're yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow,</v>

1106
00:51:55.511 --> 00:51:56.830
<v Speaker 2>walk by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll walk out.</v>

1107
00:51:56.831 --> 00:52:00.670
<v Speaker 2>And they've got it was that him and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebels all have them and they're beating</v>

1108
00:52:00.671 --> 00:52:05.230
<v Speaker 2>the fuck out of them and they start </v>
<v Speaker 2>sticking things up his ass like swords.</v>

1109
00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:10.260
<v Speaker 2>They stick swords up his ass and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>stabbing them there and see other </v>

1110
00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.340
<v Speaker 2>stabbed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they just showed a murder on TV </v>

1111
00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:14.230
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1112
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:16.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean back that up with that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy is.</v>

1113
00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:21.240
<v Speaker 2>He was a bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like that guy stabbing him </v>

1114
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:21.240
<v Speaker 2>while he's there.</v>

1115
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:21.600
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was a good game of thrones killing.</v>

1116
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:23.660
<v Speaker 7>I remember it was Antosz point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1117
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:26.110
<v Speaker 7>at one point because they were.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They made like a little bit about Kadafi</v>

1118
00:52:26.111 --> 00:52:28.230
<v Speaker 7>and people and I was like a guy shoving </v>
<v Speaker 7>a knife up his ass.</v>

1119
00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the video.</v>

1120
00:52:29.591 --> 00:52:31.970
<v Speaker 2>So this doesn't really look where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy stabbing him in that picture.</v>

1121
00:52:31.971 --> 00:52:36.971
<v Speaker 2>And now that I looked at it again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like he's like slamming his </v>

1122
00:52:36.971 --> 00:52:38.350
<v Speaker 2>fist down on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1123
00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:42.040
<v Speaker 2>It's really grainy cell phone footage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1124
00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.670
<v Speaker 2>Well this is the one where they finally </v>
<v Speaker 2>captured them.</v>

1125
00:52:46.671 --> 00:52:51.671
<v Speaker 2>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're holding up their cameras and </v>

1126
00:52:51.671 --> 00:52:54.401
<v Speaker 2>this is all like captured live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have him when they have him </v>

1127
00:52:54.401 --> 00:52:56.440
<v Speaker 2>in there and he's freaking the fuck out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1128
00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:58.100
<v Speaker 2>pulling his hair and beating the shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of him.</v>

1129
00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Kicking him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when he gets up,</v>

1130
00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:04.550
<v Speaker 2>someone sticks a sword like one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>wastes swords,</v>

1131
00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:06.740
<v Speaker 2>little short swords.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like right up his ass.</v>

1132
00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.540
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Knife.</v>

1133
00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

1134
00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:14.540
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a stick or is that a a knife.</v>

1135
00:53:14.541 --> 00:53:15.350
<v Speaker 2>And then someone said it to them.</v>

1136
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:16.980
<v Speaker 7>Could've put.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing.</v>

1137
00:53:16.981 --> 00:53:21.981
<v Speaker 7>You get these guys guys like Mugabi or </v>
<v Speaker 7>Kadafi and they do so much cruelty and </v>

1138
00:53:21.981 --> 00:53:26.391
<v Speaker 7>they come off as so tough.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then he seemed like this and they </v>

1139
00:53:26.391 --> 00:53:26.391
<v Speaker 7>whimper and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and bag</v>

1140
00:53:26.391 --> 00:53:27.540
<v Speaker 4>like little bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1141
00:53:27.541 --> 00:53:29.640
<v Speaker 4>this is really embarrassing if you think</v>
<v Speaker 4>about that,</v>

1142
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:34.641
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like look at this guy and this guy was </v>

1143
00:53:34.641 --> 00:53:34.641
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1144
00:53:34.641 --> 00:53:38.450
<v Speaker 4>a huge dictator that ran his country for</v>
<v Speaker 4>a long time and killed a lot of people </v>

1145
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:44.820
<v Speaker 4>that this is how it ends for them is </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually kind of fitting.</v>

1146
00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.680
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great,</v>

1147
00:53:46.681 --> 00:53:49.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean it happened with a Saddam </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hussein,</v>

1148
00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:52.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that hiding in a little cave?</v>

1149
00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:53.460
<v Speaker 4>It's fitting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1150
00:53:53.461 --> 00:53:57.150
<v Speaker 4>but his neck fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucked up that we liked that.</v>

1151
00:53:57.151 --> 00:53:59.580
<v Speaker 4>This appeals to us like that.</v>

1152
00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:04.600
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they captured him the way they </v>

1153
00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:06.161
<v Speaker 5>captured Noriega or the way they </v>
<v Speaker 5>captured anybody else and they brought </v>

1154
00:54:06.161 --> 00:54:07.250
<v Speaker 5>them to trial in America and then put </v>
<v Speaker 5>them in prison,</v>

1155
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:12.030
<v Speaker 4>which feel any better then him being </v>
<v Speaker 4>done to death.</v>

1156
00:54:12.031 --> 00:54:15.420
<v Speaker 4>Do you feel better watching this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like where they just locking them up?</v>

1157
00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:16.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

1158
00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:18.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do because,</v>

1159
00:54:18.871 --> 00:54:20.400
<v Speaker 4>and I don't believe in the death </v>
<v Speaker 4>penalty,</v>

1160
00:54:20.401 --> 00:54:23.880
<v Speaker 4>but in terms of how do I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciously,</v>

1161
00:54:23.881 --> 00:54:26.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe in the death penalty </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I think it's flawed.</v>

1162
00:54:26.281 --> 00:54:29.310
<v Speaker 4>I think the system that would execute </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody isn't perfect.</v>

1163
00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:30.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

1164
00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:32.040
<v Speaker 4>But in a case like this where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1165
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:34.230
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that if he's being killed by the</v>

1166
00:54:34.231 --> 00:54:39.231
<v Speaker 4>people that he's been subjugating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something very poetic about </v>

1167
00:54:39.231 --> 00:54:42.621
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a real problem with </v>

1168
00:54:42.621 --> 00:54:42.621
<v Speaker 4>cases,</v>

1169
00:54:42.621 --> 00:54:47.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's a murder case or whether </v>

1170
00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:47.060
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1171
00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:47.060
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any kind of a case,</v>

1172
00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.230
<v Speaker 5>even like armed robbery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of,</v>

1173
00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:49.160
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1174
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:52.950
<v Speaker 5>there's a real problem when people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>competing against each other.</v>

1175
00:54:52.951 --> 00:54:55.830
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm trying to get to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you have like a defense team that's</v>

1176
00:54:55.831 --> 00:55:00.270
<v Speaker 5>competing against prosecution team and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to win and you know,</v>

1177
00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:05.280
<v Speaker 5>you see it all the time in business </v>
<v Speaker 5>where things are inflated and there's </v>

1178
00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.450
<v Speaker 5>these crazy arguments get made.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are they trying to do?</v>

1179
00:55:06.451 --> 00:55:08.100
<v Speaker 5>They trying to build up their side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just not,</v>

1180
00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.890
<v Speaker 5>not try to be as objective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as objective as possible.</v>

1181
00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:13.230
<v Speaker 5>Trying to go into it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1182
00:55:13.231 --> 00:55:18.231
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as cops we probably could have done a </v>

1183
00:55:18.231 --> 00:55:19.851
<v Speaker 5>little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We probably could have been friendly as </v>

1184
00:55:19.851 --> 00:55:20.670
<v Speaker 5>we walked up to him and maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't have gotten defensive and maybe</v>

1185
00:55:20.671 --> 00:55:23.840
<v Speaker 5>we could have shaken hands and go on </v>
<v Speaker 5>about our day in our lives and our paths</v>

1186
00:55:23.841 --> 00:55:25.260
<v Speaker 5>would have gone a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But Hey,</v>

1187
00:55:25.261 --> 00:55:26.370
<v Speaker 5>hindsight's 20 slash 20</v>

1188
00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:27.900
<v Speaker 4>learning experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1189
00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:30.030
<v Speaker 4>Learning experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want</v>

1190
00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:32.290
<v Speaker 5>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't ever hear that.</v>

1191
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:35.590
<v Speaker 5>It's always like one hard line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I approach a suspect.</v>

1192
00:55:35.591 --> 00:55:37.930
<v Speaker 5>He was moving in a very dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 5>manner.</v>

1193
00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:40.810
<v Speaker 5>I saw the suspect reaching his pants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I told him not to.</v>

1194
00:55:40.811 --> 00:55:42.970
<v Speaker 5>He did it again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I at this point,</v>

1195
00:55:42.971 --> 00:55:44.650
<v Speaker 5>I took the safety off my weapon</v>

1196
00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:50.580
<v Speaker 4>discharge 32 times and you watched the </v>
<v Speaker 4>video and that's not what happened at </v>

1197
00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:51.010
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like someone who has cell phone on it.</v>

1198
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:53.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not what happened.</v>

1199
00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:55.210
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird system.</v>

1200
00:55:55.211 --> 00:55:58.180
<v Speaker 4>It's completely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just conflict.</v>

1201
00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:00.280
<v Speaker 4>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the prosecutor,</v>

1202
00:56:00.281 --> 00:56:03.580
<v Speaker 4>your job guys are proud of the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1203
00:56:03.581 --> 00:56:06.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you saw that I'm making </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a murderer.</v>

1204
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.390
<v Speaker 4>I saw some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the price water,</v>

1205
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:12.130
<v Speaker 4>we'll get too involved in this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched two episodes and I was like,</v>

1206
00:56:12.131 --> 00:56:17.131
<v Speaker 4>this is just to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get involved in these </v>

1207
00:56:17.131 --> 00:56:17.860
<v Speaker 4>people's ridiculous lives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was proud of how many convictions</v>

1208
00:56:17.861 --> 00:56:22.861
<v Speaker 4>he'd he'd had like it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like undefeated or something in </v>

1209
00:56:22.861 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 4>the county,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so not rotten.</v>

1210
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:28.090
<v Speaker 7>I don't smell anything right there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the guys in Texas that put people to</v>

1211
00:56:28.091 --> 00:56:33.091
<v Speaker 7>the death penalty and that's like </v>
<v Speaker 7>they're at a bar that night having a </v>

1212
00:56:33.091 --> 00:56:36.451
<v Speaker 7>champagne,</v>
<v Speaker 7>celebrating that he won his case and he </v>

1213
00:56:36.451 --> 00:56:38.690
<v Speaker 7>said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the God of the Gas Chamber Day</v>

1214
00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:41.340
<v Speaker 6>put down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>put down to do.</v>

1215
00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:43.470
<v Speaker 6>That's what they were called it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'd put down.</v>

1216
00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:46.050
<v Speaker 6>He puts down one of the bag we put down </v>
<v Speaker 6>today.</v>

1217
00:56:46.051 --> 00:56:47.940
<v Speaker 6>Everybody knuckles up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>locals,</v>

1218
00:56:48.050 --> 00:56:48.930
<v Speaker 6>locals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all around.</v>

1219
00:56:48.931 --> 00:56:50.100
<v Speaker 6>We put down today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boy,</v>

1220
00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:53.130
<v Speaker 6>we've got a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Good one for the good guys.</v>

1221
00:56:53.131 --> 00:56:53.910
<v Speaker 6>Clink,</v>
<v Speaker 6>clink,</v>

1222
00:56:53.911 --> 00:56:57.570
<v Speaker 6>budweisers and get sloshed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Show for work foggy.</v>

1223
00:56:57.571 --> 00:57:00.750
<v Speaker 6>I'd do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Put a notch in their Oxford loafers.</v>

1224
00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:05.930
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean they are dealing with a lot of </v>

1225
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:05.930
<v Speaker 6>scumbags and pieces of shit and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 6>ways.</v>

1226
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:06.660
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but no.</v>

1227
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000
<v Speaker 7>Back to your point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Their goal is not to discern the truth </v>

1228
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.830
<v Speaker 7>and eliminate what could be done better.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just to kill this guy.</v>

1229
00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:15.050
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:20.160
<v Speaker 6>Cops don't plant evidence and try to </v>
<v Speaker 6>frame people because they're infallible </v>

1231
00:57:21.251 --> 00:57:23.080
<v Speaker 6>and awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's just the right thing to do.</v>

1232
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:23.580
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're.</v>

1233
00:57:23.581 --> 00:57:28.581
<v Speaker 6>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're doing what a dirty accountant </v>

1234
00:57:28.581 --> 00:57:28.581
<v Speaker 6>does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1235
00:57:28.581 --> 00:57:30.220
<v Speaker 6>they're doing what a joke thief does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're doing what a,</v>

1236
00:57:30.221 --> 00:57:33.440
<v Speaker 6>a guy who steals in a lot of ways now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love that.</v>

1237
00:57:33.441 --> 00:57:35.320
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you like when a,</v>

1238
00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:40.350
<v Speaker 6>when a guy steals a song,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the rhythms beats when they sue </v>

1239
00:57:40.831 --> 00:57:42.250
<v Speaker 6>people for that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1240
00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.640
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how I connected all those </v>
<v Speaker 6>together.</v>

1241
00:57:45.641 --> 00:57:47.260
<v Speaker 6>I really had a point until you started </v>
<v Speaker 6>laughing.</v>

1242
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:53.250
<v Speaker 6>I started it suck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's something,</v>

1243
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:54.280
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they,</v>

1244
00:57:54.281 --> 00:57:55.300
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they suck at,</v>

1245
00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:56.410
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1246
00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:01.150
<v Speaker 6>the gigantic responsibility that comes </v>
<v Speaker 6>with being a police officer.</v>

1247
00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:02.290
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's not,</v>

1248
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.760
<v Speaker 6>they're not really qualified for that.</v>

1249
00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:06.510
<v Speaker 7>It's a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Each one is a politician.</v>

1250
00:58:06.511 --> 00:58:09.930
<v Speaker 7>They're supposed to be on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 7>interacting with people,</v>

1251
00:58:09.931 --> 00:58:12.240
<v Speaker 7>making connections,</v>
<v Speaker 7>getting people to trust them,</v>

1252
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:15.180
<v Speaker 7>getting people to follow their lead.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1253
00:58:15.181 --> 00:58:20.181
<v Speaker 7>like you read,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I read about this one lapd guy and he </v>

1254
00:58:20.181 --> 00:58:22.821
<v Speaker 7>started a football team and it was a </v>
<v Speaker 7>police football team and nobody would </v>

1255
00:58:23.401 --> 00:58:28.401
<v Speaker 7>join because the community was so </v>
<v Speaker 7>opposed to the cops that literally they </v>

1256
00:58:29.041 --> 00:58:30.360
<v Speaker 7>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we got uniforms,</v>

1257
00:58:30.361 --> 00:58:31.650
<v Speaker 7>we got helmets,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we got fields,</v>

1258
00:58:31.651 --> 00:58:33.690
<v Speaker 7>we get coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We want to have a team.</v>

1259
00:58:33.691 --> 00:58:35.490
<v Speaker 7>You guys can play against other city </v>
<v Speaker 7>teams.</v>

1260
00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:39.060
<v Speaker 7>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then this one guy started,</v>

1261
00:58:39.061 --> 00:58:44.061
<v Speaker 7>he was a former player cop now and he </v>
<v Speaker 7>reached out and slowly got one kid,</v>

1262
00:58:44.101 --> 00:58:47.370
<v Speaker 7>two kids finally get up to 11 kids,</v>
<v Speaker 7>started training him,</v>

1263
00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:49.140
<v Speaker 7>got to know the parents,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the other,</v>

1264
00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:50.820
<v Speaker 7>the other cops were helping out </v>
<v Speaker 7>training,</v>

1265
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.870
<v Speaker 7>got to know the parents and it opened up</v>
<v Speaker 7>this whole community.</v>

1266
00:58:54.871 --> 00:58:58.200
<v Speaker 7>It changed the caves in south central.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Somewhere in the whole neighborhood is,</v>

1267
00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:00.330
<v Speaker 7>has a great relationship with the cops </v>
<v Speaker 7>now.</v>

1268
00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:01.730
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1269
00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:03.560
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It can be done right?</v>

1270
00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:06.830
<v Speaker 6>It can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This just got to be away.</v>

1271
00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:09.410
<v Speaker 6>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you look at the overall picture,</v>

1272
00:59:09.411 --> 00:59:14.411
<v Speaker 6>it's got to be a way to do it better </v>
<v Speaker 6>than they're doing it right now across </v>

1273
00:59:14.411 --> 00:59:17.921
<v Speaker 6>the board.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything was like managing </v>

1274
00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:17.921
<v Speaker 6>communities.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it just,</v>

1275
00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:20.360
<v Speaker 6>it just seems like there's so much room </v>
<v Speaker 6>for improvement.</v>

1276
00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1277
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:27.080
<v Speaker 4>Obama just released 111 prisoners and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that the message that he's sending</v>

1278
00:59:27.081 --> 00:59:32.081
<v Speaker 4>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got to get over this police state </v>

1279
00:59:32.081 --> 00:59:32.081
<v Speaker 4>mentality</v>

1280
00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:33.380
<v Speaker 6>release.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One guy that,</v>

1281
00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:38.390
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>had retweeted a petition to release him </v>

1282
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.390
<v Speaker 6>like a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1283
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:39.260
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was,</v>

1284
00:59:39.261 --> 00:59:42.320
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in jail for life,</v>

1285
00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:43.640
<v Speaker 6>for selling lsd.</v>

1286
00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:45.210
<v Speaker 4>How would a grateful dead concert?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1287
00:59:45.211 --> 00:59:49.440
<v Speaker 4>I ran and Obama exonerated him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's never should've gone to jail in the</v>

1288
00:59:49.441 --> 00:59:49.890
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1289
00:59:49.891 --> 00:59:52.350
<v Speaker 4>it was his third strike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I went.</v>

1290
00:59:52.351 --> 00:59:54.180
<v Speaker 4>But they got to get rid of that third </v>
<v Speaker 4>strike thing.</v>

1291
00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:59.270
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also when you do as much acid as </v>

1292
00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:01.551
<v Speaker 4>that guy does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he think he remembers those first two </v>

1293
01:00:01.551 --> 01:00:03.351
<v Speaker 4>strikes I made up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That three strikes thing is crazy.</v>

1294
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.090
<v Speaker 6>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not for,</v>

1295
01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:16.020
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>encouraging people to continue fucking </v>

1296
01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:16.020
<v Speaker 6>up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the thing that,</v>

1297
01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.130
<v Speaker 6>the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if someone does three petty crimes,</v>

1298
01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:21.160
<v Speaker 6>I mean how many,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how bad is the crime after be?</v>

1299
01:00:21.161 --> 01:00:24.490
<v Speaker 6>Does it have to be a violent crime </v>
<v Speaker 6>before your three?</v>

1300
01:00:24.790 --> 01:00:29.790
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That doesn't make sense with the </v>

1301
01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:31.681
<v Speaker 6>grateful dead thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Unless somehow know that they think of </v>

1302
01:00:31.681 --> 01:00:33.811
<v Speaker 6>selling drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they find some sneaky way to categorize </v>

1303
01:00:33.811 --> 01:00:33.811
<v Speaker 6>that as violence.</v>

1304
01:00:33.811 --> 01:00:34.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe if it's a,</v>

1305
01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:37.460
<v Speaker 4>what do they call it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Level one drug or assets.</v>

1306
01:00:37.461 --> 01:00:39.020
<v Speaker 4>Probably like the highest level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs,</v>

1307
01:00:39.021 --> 01:00:41.930
<v Speaker 4>so maybe that's a felony,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whereas pot would be a misdemeanor.</v>

1308
01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.400
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1309
01:00:43.401 --> 01:00:44.870
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would wonder.</v>

1310
01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:47.720
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't sound like the other charges </v>
<v Speaker 4>were violent.</v>

1311
01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.330
<v Speaker 4>I think all three were drug related.</v>

1312
01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:55.560
<v Speaker 6>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the thing about acid that you can get a </v>

1313
01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.880
<v Speaker 6>whole lot of it in a very small,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like packaged.</v>

1314
01:00:57.910 --> 01:01:00.350
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you can get a whole lot of hits and</v>

1315
01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:02.890
<v Speaker 6>you can carry it on you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like books of stamps.</v>

1316
01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:07.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's a lot of people are getting </v>

1317
01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.080
<v Speaker 6>fucked up off that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1318
01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:13.030
<v Speaker 6>So I think that's problematic to people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think to get super nervous about that.</v>

1319
01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:18.300
<v Speaker 6>Mckenna had some speech he did about </v>
<v Speaker 6>that once about how someone in a regular</v>

1320
01:01:18.761 --> 01:01:23.761
<v Speaker 6>apartment with a bathtub can make enough</v>
<v Speaker 6>acid to get a million people blasted.</v>

1321
01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:27.590
<v Speaker 4>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1322
01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:32.980
<v Speaker 4>Think of the quality control there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One guy's getting triple the amount of </v>

1323
01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:33.020
<v Speaker 4>another guy.</v>

1324
01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:36.590
<v Speaker 6>This is another great analogy that </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone said or wish I remember who,</v>

1325
01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:41.620
<v Speaker 6>but they said that acid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like in the molecule form the molecular </v>

1326
01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:42.300
<v Speaker 6>form,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1327
01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:47.330
<v Speaker 6>it's so potent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is literally like watching an ant </v>

1328
01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:49.430
<v Speaker 6>dissolve,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the empire state building,</v>

1329
01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:55.110
<v Speaker 6>like something as small as an aunt or </v>
<v Speaker 6>build or dissolve or take like you're </v>

1330
01:01:55.521 --> 01:02:00.521
<v Speaker 6>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I should probably know if it's built to </v>

1331
01:02:00.521 --> 01:02:00.521
<v Speaker 6>dissolve,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1332
01:02:00.521 --> 01:02:03.680
<v Speaker 6>Thing might be built,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the idea being that there's so much </v>

1333
01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.480
<v Speaker 6>power in such a small molecule,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's such a small,</v>

1334
01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:08.120
<v Speaker 6>amazing that you need the tiniest dose.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like a blip.</v>

1335
01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:13.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're fucking crazy.</v>

1336
01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:16.150
<v Speaker 4>I talked to a dude who did 25 hits of </v>
<v Speaker 4>acid in one setting.</v>

1337
01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:18.010
<v Speaker 4>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck them up.</v>

1338
01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:23.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what he was like before </v>

1339
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:23.460
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

1340
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:23.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed okay.</v>

1341
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:23.610
<v Speaker 2>I knew a couple of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It changed.</v>

1342
01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1343
01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:27.630
<v Speaker 2>Just lost their edge man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1344
01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:30.480
<v Speaker 2>just had that kind of slightly vacant </v>
<v Speaker 2>stare all the time.</v>

1345
01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.700
<v Speaker 2>That's why I never took acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've taken everything,</v>

1346
01:02:32.701 --> 01:02:37.701
<v Speaker 2>but I've never taken acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It definitely seems like it has a </v>

1347
01:02:37.701 --> 01:02:39.720
<v Speaker 2>potential to do that and I think some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people just go super deep man.</v>

1348
01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>

1349
01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1350
01:02:43.621 --> 01:02:48.621
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm following algae on a molecular </v>

1351
01:02:48.621 --> 01:02:50.580
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The power of LSD is equivalent to a fire</v>

1352
01:02:50.581 --> 01:02:55.581
<v Speaker 2>ant that can completely tear down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>empire state building and under 30 </v>

1353
01:02:55.581 --> 01:02:55.581
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1354
01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.570
<v Speaker 2>so that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the first time.</v>

1355
01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:00.570
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is that?</v>

1356
01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:05.010
<v Speaker 2>A fire ant that could take down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>empire state building in 30 minutes.</v>

1357
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.980
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they make it?</v>

1358
01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Just a really good question and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know the answer to that.</v>

1359
01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:15.420
<v Speaker 2>I know who figured it out and you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>the story of Albert Hoffman.</v>

1360
01:03:15.450 --> 01:03:20.450
<v Speaker 2>The guy was a creating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was trying to come up with a </v>

1361
01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:21.220
<v Speaker 2>women's fertility drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that was the original thing.</v>

1362
01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.200
<v Speaker 2>I think so if I remember correctly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where it came from,</v>

1363
01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:30.180
<v Speaker 2>but then they used it for all different </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of successfully on his hands.</v>

1364
01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1365
01:03:31.261 --> 01:03:34.290
<v Speaker 2>he was the Guinea pig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got on his hands in the lab.</v>

1366
01:03:34.291 --> 01:03:35.610
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know what the fuck he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>touching.</v>

1367
01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guy knew his skin through his hands.</v>

1368
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure that's the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he went riding home on his bike </v>

1369
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:44.940
<v Speaker 2>tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen his balls off,</v>

1370
01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:50.300
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the world in a whole new </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of looking at life in a whole </v>

1371
01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.110
<v Speaker 2>different way and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1372
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:54.810
<v Speaker 2>that's where I asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was born.</v>

1373
01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:59.960
<v Speaker 2>And then he went back to it and he did a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of different experience </v>

1374
01:03:59.960 --> 01:03:59.960
<v Speaker 2>experiments with it.</v>

1375
01:03:59.960 --> 01:03:59.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Ucla,</v>

1376
01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Columbia University,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some that didn't go.</v>

1377
01:04:02.011 --> 01:04:03.240
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Berkeley.</v>

1378
01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:04.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1379
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think some of those were staged by</v>

1380
01:04:06.631 --> 01:04:11.631
<v Speaker 2>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know who was involved in one of </v>

1381
01:04:11.631 --> 01:04:11.631
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1382
01:04:11.631 --> 01:04:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Harvard asset studies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard?</v>

1383
01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:15.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Timothy leary.</v>

1384
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Ted Kaczynski.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Shit.</v>

1385
01:04:17.531 --> 01:04:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1386
01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Ted Kaczynski was a part of one of those</v>

<v Speaker 7>got this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So he's home one day and a guy knocks at</v>

<v Speaker 7>tv she wanted on the slots.</v>

01:07:18.381 --> 01:07:23.381
<v Speaker 7>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then she got run down one time by a </v>

<v Speaker 7>guy who would just,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Guy One got excited.</v>

1456
01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Just ran a over ran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just ran down the yelling.</v>

1457
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.660
<v Speaker 2>The screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1458
01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.780
<v Speaker 2>And just smashed into the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smashed to the ground.</v>

1459
01:07:41.781 --> 01:07:44.130
<v Speaker 2>She was in a wheelchair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1460
01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:47.720
<v Speaker 2>it's all gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

1461
01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did that get resolved?</v>

1462
01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1463
01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.660
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if there was a lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1464
01:07:53.661 --> 01:07:57.520
<v Speaker 2>it's like for him it's like I win all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this money and then it's gone.</v>

1465
01:07:57.530 --> 01:07:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1466
01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Like right there in one movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's going to sue him for sure.</v>

1467
01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:03.380
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just give me the bag.</v>

1468
01:08:03.381 --> 01:08:05.150
<v Speaker 2>Let's walk away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think she sued him?</v>

1469
01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.150
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1470
01:08:07.151 --> 01:08:12.151
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't seem like her nature to sue,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but at the same time the insurance </v>

1471
01:08:12.151 --> 01:08:13.030
<v Speaker 7>company might make her.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because once you get medical bills,</v>

1472
01:08:13.031 --> 01:08:14.920
<v Speaker 7>your insurance company immediately goes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1473
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 7>we're not paying these.</v>

1474
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.060
<v Speaker 4>You've got to sue the other person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1475
01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:18.800
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1476
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:21.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1477
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:23.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If your dog bites somebody,</v>

1478
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:26.690
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get sued by their </v>
<v Speaker 4>insurance company.</v>

1479
01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:30.680
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1480
01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:34.420
<v Speaker 4>totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a guy running over you like that.</v>

1481
01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:37.240
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so awful,</v>

1482
01:08:37.241 --> 01:08:42.241
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're an older woman and some big </v>

1483
01:08:42.241 --> 01:08:44.200
<v Speaker 4>fucking stupid dude runs you over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck man.</v>

1484
01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.900
<v Speaker 4>And it's one thing if you're like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1485
01:08:46.901 --> 01:08:51.901
<v Speaker 4>maybe you were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were helping out down at the </v>

1486

<v Speaker 4>Somebody ran you over your gambling.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He does work in the fucking the one arm </v>
<v Speaker 4>bandit.</v>

1488

<v Speaker 4>I don't gamble anymore.</v>

1490
01:09:00.921 --> 01:09:03.530
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just so predictable.</v>

1491
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.960
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look,</v>

1492
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:08.870
<v Speaker 4>if you look an hour down the line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's predictable,</v>

1493
01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.050
<v Speaker 4>but feel 10 minutes down the line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's exciting.</v>

1494
01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:13.130
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a little.</v>

1501
01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:30.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>double we please.</v>

1502
01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.040
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>

1503
01:09:32.190 --> 01:09:36.050
<v Speaker 4>It's you're getting one stroke of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dick every like three minutes.</v>

1504
01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:40.490
<v Speaker 4>Not a full hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've just a soft stroke down,</v>

1505
01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:42.940
<v Speaker 4>pulling the foreskin over the crown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a little bit issue.</v>

1506
01:09:42.941 --> 01:09:45.620
<v Speaker 4>She releases and then she walks away for</v>
<v Speaker 4>three minutes,</v>

1507
01:09:45.621 --> 01:09:49.400
<v Speaker 4>comes back and then you got this weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with this dealer,</v>

1508
01:09:49.401 --> 01:09:49.880
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

1509
01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:56.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well this guy is either given you money </v>

1510
01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:56.040
<v Speaker 4>or taking money away from you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's like,</v>

1511
01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:56.040
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just my job.</v>

1512
01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:57.660
<v Speaker 4>That's my job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1513
01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:00.490
<v Speaker 4>He touches money all day and they barely</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay him.</v>

1514
01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:05.640
<v Speaker 4>The guy's making.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's making 15 bucks an hour and he's </v>

1515
01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:06.880
<v Speaker 4>dealing with thousands of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much do they make?</v>

1516
01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:09.670
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a union gig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get tips,</v>

1517
01:10:09.671 --> 01:10:11.020
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big part.</v>

1518
01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they pull tips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they probably pull their tips.</v>

1519
01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:18.310
<v Speaker 4>They pool them all the people together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make sense.</v>

1520
01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.560
<v Speaker 4>That would seem like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>

1521
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:25.590
<v Speaker 4>Is that how they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're one of the eight people </v>

1522
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.590
<v Speaker 4>working in an hour or whatever during </v>
<v Speaker 4>your shift,</v>

1523
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:29.170
<v Speaker 4>however they do it and you're at the hot</v>
<v Speaker 4>table and your table makes $25,000</v>

1524
01:10:29.171 --> 01:10:32.550
<v Speaker 4>in tips just because you circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 4>were there just because of the.</v>

1525
01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.510
<v Speaker 4>The like the schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the routine.</v>

1526
01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:39.540
<v Speaker 4>Just a shift cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you made a year's money and </v>

1527
01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:39.790
<v Speaker 4>everybody else you're working with guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>zero.</v>

1528
01:10:39.791 --> 01:10:40.840
<v Speaker 4>They're all gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be pissed at you.</v>

1529
01:10:40.841 --> 01:10:45.570
<v Speaker 4>And how long have you been a communist?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying I have a friend that did</v>

1530
01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.930
<v Speaker 4>it and Columbus side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that's how it works,</v>

1531
01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:49.300
<v Speaker 4>so they shouldn't try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shouldn't try.</v>

1532
01:10:49.450 --> 01:10:51.100
<v Speaker 4>They shouldn't be charming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

1533
01:10:51.101 --> 01:10:53.650
<v Speaker 4>it totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of them just,</v>

1534
01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:56.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're so over it and you can tell it's</v>

1535
01:10:56.231 --> 01:10:58.230
<v Speaker 4>like a typical union.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jack and I love unions.</v>

1536
01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm all about fixing the fucking unions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there were a problem.</v>

1537
01:11:01.511 --> 01:11:04.660
<v Speaker 4>I know they don't work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like you see that it's like a flight</v>

1538
01:11:04.661 --> 01:11:07.000
<v Speaker 4>attendant or a dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they're over it,</v>

1539
01:11:07.001 --> 01:11:09.310
<v Speaker 4>it's like you gotta just put them out to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pasture.</v>

1540
01:11:09.490 --> 01:11:11.440
<v Speaker 4>He can't keep them working in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>business.</v>

1541
01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:12.940
<v Speaker 4>When they don't smile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't.</v>

1542
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 4>Their</v>

1543
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.240
<v Speaker 7>energy is negative.</v>

1544
01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:17.760
<v Speaker 2>Get them the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bad for business.</v>

1545
01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.840
<v Speaker 2>It's bad for business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1546
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:23.940
<v Speaker 2>it's man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can you do though?</v>

1547
01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:24.940
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's seniority.</v>

1548
01:11:24.941 --> 01:11:27.100
<v Speaker 7>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're getting the oldest,</v>

1549
01:11:27.101 --> 01:11:28.090
<v Speaker 7>most tired people</v>

1550
01:11:28.690 --> 01:11:31.570
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let.</v>

1551
01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:34.260
<v Speaker 2>That's why I like a new airline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1552
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:35.740
<v Speaker 2>You got a virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Virgins Gray.</v>

1553
01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got hot,</v>

1554
01:11:36.671 --> 01:11:39.130
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful flight attendants.</v>

1555
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:41.200
<v Speaker 2>After a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People just don't want to work anymore.</v>

1556
01:11:41.201 --> 01:11:43.120
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people work too much.</v>

1557
01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.880
<v Speaker 2>I think they work too long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1558
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:48.880
<v Speaker 2>I think that's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did you become a communist?</v>

1559
01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.670
<v Speaker 2>Today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right after Jamie and made sense.</v>

1560
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Jamie made sense with the tips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1561
01:11:54.201 --> 01:11:57.550
<v Speaker 2>he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't stick to my ideas.</v>

1562
01:11:57.551 --> 01:12:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Folks call it flip flopping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not married to these motherfuckers.</v>

1563
01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why this is,</v>

1564
01:12:02.471 --> 01:12:04.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an open dialogue.</v>

1565
01:12:04.871 --> 01:12:07.030
<v Speaker 2>We're here to change and grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1566
01:12:07.330 --> 01:12:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Trying to change and grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to learn some information or what</v>

1567
01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.330
<v Speaker 2>a great fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about this yesterday,</v>

1568
01:12:13.331 --> 01:12:18.331
<v Speaker 2>but Neil degrasse Tyson had this great </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter quote that said there should be </v>

1569
01:12:18.331 --> 01:12:20.310
<v Speaker 2>an option in this presidential election </v>
<v Speaker 2>for an all presidential elections,</v>

1570
01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:23.740
<v Speaker 2>I think you said for none of the above,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then if none of the above wins,</v>

1571
01:12:23.741 --> 01:12:26.650
<v Speaker 2>we have to start all over again with new</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like it.</v>

1572
01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:29.290
<v Speaker 2>That would definitely be the case this </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1573
01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.600
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a really good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1574
01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:33.320
<v Speaker 2>that's a really good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1575
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of the above requires a </v>

1576
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:40.921
<v Speaker 2>congressional reexamination of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>election process and the potential </v>

1577
01:12:41.201 --> 01:12:42.840
<v Speaker 2>candidates and what makes them </v>
<v Speaker 2>qualified.</v>

1578
01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:44.620
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do it live on television.</v>

1579
01:12:44.621 --> 01:12:47.050
<v Speaker 2>There's long discussions like for days </v>
<v Speaker 2>and days and days,</v>

1580
01:12:47.051 --> 01:12:48.910
<v Speaker 2>like on Cspan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1581
01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:52.090
<v Speaker 2>remember those you ever watch cspan just</v>
<v Speaker 2>watched people argue about shit.</v>

1582
01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.040
<v Speaker 2>Now you're watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

1583
01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1584
01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:59.740
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting to see how the courts </v>
<v Speaker 2>work and everything so formal and I </v>

1585
01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:00.830
<v Speaker 2>guess you have to have like these really</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear rules when you're all talking.</v>

1586
01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:05.860
<v Speaker 2>The gentleman has five minutes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>address when you ever have anything </v>

1587
01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:05.860
<v Speaker 2>formal.</v>

1588
01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:10.330
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they said it has rules because when it </v>

1589
01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:13.241
<v Speaker 7>was first created,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was the southerners and they were </v>

1590
01:13:13.241 --> 01:13:15.431
<v Speaker 7>genteel.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So to this day when I'm talking to </v>

1591
01:13:15.431 --> 01:13:16.010
<v Speaker 7>another member,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you never say you.</v>

1592
01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.780
<v Speaker 7>You're not allowed to say you to </v>
<v Speaker 7>somebody.</v>

1593

<v Speaker 7>person about it.</v>

1602

<v Speaker 2>she knew who was really good at those </v>
<v Speaker 2>speeches.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was a politician.</v>

1608
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:59.360
<v Speaker 2>He liked his policies much of a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>good looking guy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1612
01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.830
<v Speaker 2>Which makes me respect them even more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For some reason.</v>

1613
01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:13.150
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a fascinating character because I </v>

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1616
01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like a rally the troops,</v>

1617
01:14:19.751 --> 01:14:21.330
<v Speaker 2>like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he,</v>

1618
01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:25.030
<v Speaker 2>he would get like super passionate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they give really good speeches.</v>

1619
01:14:25.031 --> 01:14:26.740
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like God damn.</v>

1620
01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:31.150
<v Speaker 2>And I remember people thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker is a real politician.</v>

1621
01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:34.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust a politician that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking somebody on the side.</v>

1622
01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Let me hear this</v>

1623
01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:37.820
<v Speaker 1>in a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're still a no.</v>

1624
01:14:38.210 --> 01:14:39.970
<v Speaker 1>And then we stand up and start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

1625
01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.840
<v Speaker 1>We had a different process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We vote yes.</v>

1626
01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:43.710
<v Speaker 1>If you vote yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you believe yes,</v>

1627
01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.880
<v Speaker 1>your vote in favor of funding you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it's the right thing.</v>

1628
01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:52.060
<v Speaker 1>If you believe it's the wrong thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know we are following up with your </v>

1629
01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:59.020
<v Speaker 1>regular order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular order to get to intimidate </v>

1630
01:15:01.521 --> 01:15:02.510
<v Speaker 1>people into bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's right.</v>

1631
01:15:02.690 --> 01:15:05.420
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gentleman is wrong.</v>

1632
01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Rather than doing the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Republicans wrapping her arms </v>

1633
01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.680
<v Speaker 1>around Republicans rather than doing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right thing on behalf of the heroes.</v>

1634
01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:20.770
<v Speaker 1>It is a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shame if you believe this is a bad idea </v>

1635
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:26.470
<v Speaker 1>to provide healthcare view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a different procedure.</v>

1636
01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.640
<v Speaker 1>The gentlemen will absorb regular order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

1637
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:39.600
<v Speaker 1>The only thing missing is fucking.</v>

1638
01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:44.190
<v Speaker 2>He's a bad motherfucker fucking in </v>
<v Speaker 2>between every phrase because that's what</v>

1639
01:15:44.191 --> 01:15:48.010
<v Speaker 2>he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to sit the fuck down there.</v>

1640
01:15:48.090 --> 01:15:49.910
<v Speaker 2>He's just too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

1641
01:15:49.911 --> 01:15:51.720
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1642
01:15:51.721 --> 01:15:53.010
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1643
01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:55.830
<v Speaker 2>this is a fiery guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fiery horny.</v>

1644
01:15:55.831 --> 01:15:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Passionate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1645
01:15:56.940 --> 01:16:01.710
<v Speaker 2>look at the JFK Johnson and Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that he's,</v>

1646
01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:07.100
<v Speaker 2>you've never see a politician that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>that level of emotion that's incredibly </v>

1647
01:16:07.171 --> 01:16:08.640
<v Speaker 2>rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like what he's doing,</v>

1648
01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:10.630
<v Speaker 2>there's very theatrical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1649
01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Which is what they've always said that </v>
<v Speaker 2>like politicians are just ugly actors.</v>

1650
01:16:15.330 --> 01:16:16.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1651
01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:19.190
<v Speaker 2>like it's like show business for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weren't that good looking?</v>

1652
01:16:19.230 --> 01:16:24.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's kind of in a way what it is </v>

1653
01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:26.871
<v Speaker 2>and they don't really have a talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although Bill Clinton did play the Sax </v>

1654
01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:27.630
<v Speaker 2>Saxophone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>

1655
01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was before he was president,</v>

1656
01:16:29.941 --> 01:16:32.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't it when he went on to senior hall</v>

1657
01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:33.660
<v Speaker 2>now running?</v>

1658
01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was.</v>

1659
01:16:34.801 --> 01:16:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was running.</v>

1660
01:16:35.701 --> 01:16:40.701
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they say it got into the black </v>

1661
01:16:40.701 --> 01:16:40.701
<v Speaker 2>vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1662
01:16:40.701 --> 01:16:40.701
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one,</v>

1663
01:16:40.701 --> 01:16:42.440
<v Speaker 2>he's another perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just buzzy.</v>

1664
01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:44.070
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was an animal.</v>

1665
01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:48.030
<v Speaker 2>That's why these people are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's why they want to be a leader.</v>

1666
01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.880
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we want to deny our </v>
<v Speaker 2>very nature.</v>

1667
01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.070
<v Speaker 2>We almost want to pretend that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

1668
01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:58.250
<v Speaker 2>like these crazy fiery people that get </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody rallied up that there's not </v>

1669
01:16:58.651 --> 01:17:01.050
<v Speaker 2>other things that go with that package.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1670
01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Of course he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's,</v>

1671
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:05.920
<v Speaker 2>he's went of course weight over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1672
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Took pictures of his kid next to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>dick.</v>

1673
01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that to the girl can</v>

1674
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.930
<v Speaker 7>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's weird.</v>

1675
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:16.070
<v Speaker 7>He's got a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's definitely sad for the wife because</v>

1676
01:17:16.071 --> 01:17:17.440
<v Speaker 7>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1677
01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:19.580
<v Speaker 7>she forgave him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She took him back.</v>

1678
01:17:19.581 --> 01:17:22.730
<v Speaker 7>He said he was going to go to these </v>
<v Speaker 7>classes and do all that shit and then.</v>

1679
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:23.710
<v Speaker 7>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1680
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:26.450
<v Speaker 7>it's humiliating the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's pitiful.</v>

1681
01:17:26.451 --> 01:17:26.870
<v Speaker 7>The second.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1682
01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.080
<v Speaker 6>It's hard out there for a pimp.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shit,</v>

1683
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:31.300
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1684
01:17:31.301 --> 01:17:34.390
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure it is a humiliating.</v>

1685
01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:40.140
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure it is a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's just the whole thing is </v>

1686
01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:43.981
<v Speaker 6>crazy in the first place that he has </v>
<v Speaker 6>this compulsion to just chat with girls </v>

1687
01:17:44.171 --> 01:17:46.600
<v Speaker 6>online like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>send Dick pics and stuff like.</v>

1688
01:17:46.601 --> 01:17:51.601
<v Speaker 6>It's like for him it's like so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's obviously so fun and it's beyond </v>

1689
01:17:52.511 --> 01:17:53.740
<v Speaker 6>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His last name,</v>

1690
01:17:53.741 --> 01:17:55.360
<v Speaker 6>his wiener.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's hilarious.</v>

1691
01:17:55.361 --> 01:17:56.000
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1692
01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:58.330
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's almost like we're living in a movie</v>

1693
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:02.910
<v Speaker 6>at this was in a judd apatow movie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He'd be like,</v>

1694
01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:07.660
<v Speaker 6>why is so obvious?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Name is weening of my 13.</v>

1695
01:18:08.710 --> 01:18:13.710
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dick Wiener was so weird.</v>

1696
01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:17.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People are weird,</v>

1697
01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.720
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People are fucking weird.</v>

1698
01:18:19.721 --> 01:18:20.710
<v Speaker 6>They're so weird.</v>

1699
01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:22.390
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you want to be that bad,</v>

1700
01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:27.620
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's kind of a thing in life is </v>
<v Speaker 7>like how passionate do you allow </v>

1701
01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:30.691
<v Speaker 7>yourself to be?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because there's a loss of control that </v>

1702
01:18:30.691 --> 01:18:32.200
<v Speaker 7>that goes with getting that passionate </v>
<v Speaker 7>and when you,</v>

1703
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:34.570
<v Speaker 7>when you go for it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's when you end up,</v>

1704
01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:39.810
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe having an affair or maybe killing </v>

1705
01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:40.720
<v Speaker 7>somebody because you're just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>letting your id run wild.</v>

1706
01:18:40.721 --> 01:18:43.090
<v Speaker 7>But that's where sometimes great </v>
<v Speaker 7>creativity comes from,</v>

1707
01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:46.060
<v Speaker 7>which is why you get so many great </v>
<v Speaker 7>artists and directors that ended up,</v>

1708
01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:48.040
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>woody Allen [inaudible] and his daughter</v>

1709
01:18:48.041 --> 01:18:51.010
<v Speaker 7>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a Roman Polanski,</v>

1710
01:18:51.011 --> 01:18:51.810
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1711
01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:53.830
<v Speaker 7>you just think of all the truly creative</v>
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>

1712
01:18:53.831 --> 01:18:56.440
<v Speaker 7>they do fucked up things because they're</v>
<v Speaker 7>just putting themselves out there.</v>

1713
01:18:56.950 --> 01:19:01.950
<v Speaker 6>Well also because a lot of what makes </v>
<v Speaker 6>them want to be whatever it is in the </v>

1714
01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:05.110
<v Speaker 6>first place,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's an actor or a famous person</v>

1715
01:19:05.111 --> 01:19:10.111
<v Speaker 6>or a singer or Kelly or any people like </v>
<v Speaker 6>to want to be out there that much.</v>

1716
01:19:10.810 --> 01:19:11.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Ego.</v>

1717
01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:12.850
<v Speaker 6>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some.</v>

1718
01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:16.150
<v Speaker 6>It's got to be some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some madness involved in that.</v>

1719
01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:16.900
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Usually.</v>

1720
01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:22.140
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of it involves like your </v>
<v Speaker 6>childhood and how you're wired growing </v>

1721
01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:26.371
<v Speaker 6>up or what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you were missing that led you to </v>

1722
01:19:26.371 --> 01:19:26.371
<v Speaker 6>push so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1723
01:19:26.371 --> 01:19:27.790
<v Speaker 6>Like everybody that I know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you included.</v>

<v Speaker 6>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Had some crazy fucking life growing up.</v>

1725
01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:33.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know where it was like,</v>

1726
01:19:33.011 --> 01:19:38.011
<v Speaker 6>you know when you tell me the story </v>
<v Speaker 6>about your parents chain smoking in the </v>

1727
01:19:38.011 --> 01:19:40.891
<v Speaker 6>house while you were just locked in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>winter with the windows closed and </v>

1728
01:19:40.891 --> 01:19:41.110
<v Speaker 6>you're like a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going,</v>

1730
01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:49.390
<v Speaker 6>In the car with your kid who has an </v>
<v Speaker 6>asthma inhaler in his pocket.</v>

1731
01:19:49.570 --> 01:19:50.170
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't.</v>

1732
01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:51.940
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't.</v>

1733
01:19:52.570 --> 01:19:54.340
<v Speaker 6>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>

1734
01:19:55.710 --> 01:19:58.750
<v Speaker 7>We used to give them for presence here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you remember this?</v>

1735
01:19:58.751 --> 01:20:03.751
<v Speaker 7>In Art Class?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You'd get shells and you'd paint the </v>

1736
01:20:03.751 --> 01:20:03.751
<v Speaker 7>shells.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like little clam shells.</v>

1737
01:20:03.751 --> 01:20:05.350
<v Speaker 7>You ever do that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you paint them.</v>

1738
01:20:05.351 --> 01:20:07.920
<v Speaker 7>You glaze them and bake them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then we give given to my parents and</v>

1739
01:20:07.921 --> 01:20:09.210
<v Speaker 7>they've used them as ashtrays.</v>

1740
01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:13.180
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

1741
01:20:13.450 --> 01:20:15.790
<v Speaker 6>It's like putting a cigarette out in </v>
<v Speaker 6>your little heart.</v>

1742
01:20:20.710 --> 01:20:22.390
<v Speaker 6>Here's what I think of those three </v>
<v Speaker 6>hours.</v>

1743
01:20:22.391 --> 01:20:26.890
<v Speaker 6>You spend the art class too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a pole.</v>

1744
01:20:26.891 --> 01:20:28.300
<v Speaker 6>That's an undeniable one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1745
01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:33.640
<v Speaker 6>Smoke cigarette one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That seems like everybody gets that one.</v>

1746
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:36.970
<v Speaker 6>Like the alcohol pole.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like some people get it,</v>

1747
01:20:36.971 --> 01:20:41.971
<v Speaker 6>some people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people can drink a little and not </v>

1748
01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:41.971
<v Speaker 6>drink for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cigarettes.</v>

1749
01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:46.681
<v Speaker 6>It seems like almost everybody who gets </v>
<v Speaker 6>into it gets stuck.</v>

1750
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:51.830
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seems like it's like if you were </v>

1751
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:53.680
<v Speaker 6>looking at it as a Jujitsu artists,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's got a very high rate of finishes.</v>

1752
01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:58.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's certain guys that get into </v>

1753
01:20:58.740 --> 01:20:58.740
<v Speaker 6>certain positions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you might be fucked.</v>

1754
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.700
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1755
01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:04.760
<v Speaker 6>there's this Guy Damien Maia fights in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the UFC strangles everybody and he's </v>

1756
01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:04.870
<v Speaker 6>just one of those guys when he gets on </v>
<v Speaker 6>your back,</v>

1757
01:21:04.871 --> 01:21:05.790
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ooh,</v>

1758

<v Speaker 6>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You probably fucked.</v>

1759
01:21:07.690 --> 01:21:08.520
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's the,</v>

1760
01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:13.560
<v Speaker 6>he's got a very high rate of finishing </v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's like if you're smoking </v>

1761
01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.471
<v Speaker 6>cigarettes for three months,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get Tina headline smoking cigarettes </v>

1762
01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:16.471
<v Speaker 6>everyday for three months.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Come on.</v>

1763
01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:17.770
<v Speaker 6>Let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1764
01:21:17.771 --> 01:21:19.030
<v Speaker 6>it's chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1765
01:21:19.090 --> 01:21:19.510
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1766
01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:22.750
<v Speaker 7>I mean they say they say that it's tough</v>
<v Speaker 7>for them to.</v>

1767
01:21:22.751 --> 01:21:23.620
<v Speaker 7>Heroin Addiction.</v>

1768
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:26.920
<v Speaker 6>I can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A really good.</v>

1769
01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:32.500
<v Speaker 6>I really could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've heard people argue back and forth </v>

1770
01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.921
<v Speaker 6>about the heroin thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had this Guy Dr Carl Hart on my </v>

1771
01:21:34.921 --> 01:21:35.590
<v Speaker 6>podcast and it was actually being </v>
<v Speaker 6>discussed recently on the message board,</v>

1772
01:21:35.591 --> 01:21:37.170
<v Speaker 6>which is why I'm bringing it up where </v>
<v Speaker 6>they were.</v>

1773
01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:42.200
<v Speaker 6>There were saying that he's not correct </v>
<v Speaker 6>about because he says he's actually </v>

1774
01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.450
<v Speaker 6>experimented with a bunch of drugs </v>
<v Speaker 6>himself,</v>

1775
01:21:43.451 --> 01:21:48.451
<v Speaker 6>is pretty open about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's also a like a brilliant </v>

1776
01:21:48.451 --> 01:21:51.631
<v Speaker 6>academic writes books.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's an addiction specialist and he's </v>

1777
01:21:51.631 --> 01:21:55.891
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's so much misinformation when it </v>

1778
01:21:55.891 --> 01:21:55.891
<v Speaker 6>comes to heroin withdrawal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

1779
01:21:55.891 --> 01:21:57.370
<v Speaker 6>it's like being sick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like you have the flu.</v>

1780
01:21:57.490 --> 01:21:58.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's literally what it's like.</v>

1781
01:21:59.170 --> 01:22:04.170
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the physical embodiment of all </v>

1782
01:22:04.170 --> 01:22:06.421
<v Speaker 6>the symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're very flu like and then they go </v>

1783
01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:06.421
<v Speaker 6>away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1784
01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:06.421
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's more.</v>

1785
01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:10.050
<v Speaker 6>It's more psychological and there's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's so much more going on about </v>

1786
01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:13.591
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like sort of dependency on this </v>

1787
01:22:13.591 --> 01:22:13.591
<v Speaker 6>substance.</v>

1788
01:22:13.591 --> 01:22:14.080
<v Speaker 6>It's not just like a physical </v>
<v Speaker 6>dependency,</v>

1789
01:22:14.081 --> 01:22:19.081
<v Speaker 6>like there's a bunch of other factors </v>
<v Speaker 6>that sort of can't be denied or ignored </v>

1790
01:22:19.081 --> 01:22:20.320
<v Speaker 6>and they all play in together,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then other people on my message what</v>

1791
01:22:20.321 --> 01:22:20.920
<v Speaker 6>we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1792
01:22:20.921 --> 01:22:23.260
<v Speaker 6>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like tried to kick heroin.</v>

1793
01:22:23.261 --> 01:22:28.261
<v Speaker 6>It was unbelievably hard on my body was </v>
<v Speaker 6>in shock and then then another dude who </v>

1794
01:22:28.261 --> 01:22:32.761
<v Speaker 6>said that all he did was get on a plane </v>
<v Speaker 6>and go somewhere where he knew he </v>

1795
01:22:32.761 --> 01:22:34.390
<v Speaker 6>couldn't get heroin for a while and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's how he kicked it.</v>

1796
01:22:34.391 --> 01:22:34.930
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck it,</v>

1797
01:22:34.931 --> 01:22:39.931
<v Speaker 6>I'm just not going to do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he said it was only like a few days </v>

1798
01:22:39.931 --> 01:22:40.420
<v Speaker 6>of feeling like a flu.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know who the fuck is.</v>

1799
01:22:40.421 --> 01:22:41.470
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I also don't know.</v>

1800
01:22:41.471 --> 01:22:43.270
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it's the same for everybody,</v>

1801
01:22:43.271 --> 01:22:45.580
<v Speaker 6>it's like the alcohol thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all these different things.</v>

1802
01:22:45.610 --> 01:22:46.010
<v Speaker 6>Totally.</v>

1803
01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.950
<v Speaker 7>Some people have addictive behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 7>personalities,</v>

1804
01:22:48.951 --> 01:22:53.951
<v Speaker 7>but I think the problem is is just </v>
<v Speaker 7>because you kicked the drug,</v>

1805
01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:59.420
<v Speaker 7>you're now back to square one and square</v>
<v Speaker 7>one was I need drugs.</v>

1806
01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:04.860
<v Speaker 7>You may not be addicted,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you still didn't do the work </v>

1807
01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:06.280
<v Speaker 7>necessary to rebuild your foundation and</v>
<v Speaker 7>to have dependency issues.</v>

1808
01:23:06.281 --> 01:23:11.281
<v Speaker 7>So now you're at a weakened state </v>
<v Speaker 7>because you've just had the flu and you </v>

1809
01:23:11.281 --> 01:23:12.970
<v Speaker 7>need to start going to meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 7>being disciplined,</v>

1810
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:15.250
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>go whatever it takes to,</v>

1811
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:18.970
<v Speaker 7>if it's talk therapy or exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever it is and makes you write,</v>

1812
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:21.910
<v Speaker 7>you need to transition into that </v>
<v Speaker 7>immediately.</v>

1813
01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:22.800
<v Speaker 7>And most people,</v>

1814
01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:24.300
<v Speaker 6>well don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1815
01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:31.080
<v Speaker 6>had you ever smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I smoked a cigarette or two with my </v>

1816
01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:35.221
<v Speaker 6>sister when I was 15 and she was 14.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We moved into this new neighborhood and </v>

1817
01:23:36.230 --> 01:23:39.520
<v Speaker 6>hung out with the local tufts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey Joey.</v>

1818
01:23:39.570 --> 01:23:42.550
<v Speaker 6>And we went to the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We went down to the bridge.</v>

1819
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.920
<v Speaker 6>There's this place near my house called </v>
<v Speaker 6>Eco Bridge.</v>

1820
01:23:44.921 --> 01:23:48.130
<v Speaker 6>It was actually right across the street </v>
<v Speaker 6>from my house when I was growing up.</v>

1821
01:23:48.210 --> 01:23:53.210
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could get under the bridge and you </v>

1822
01:23:53.210 --> 01:23:53.560
<v Speaker 6>could yell and it echoes in this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>

1823
01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:55.240
<v Speaker 6>It's in Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 6>upper falls,</v>

1824
01:23:55.241 --> 01:23:57.300
<v Speaker 6>Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

1825
01:23:57.610 --> 01:23:59.660
<v Speaker 6>we'd go down there and sing billy squire</v>
<v Speaker 6>song.</v>

1826
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:04.440
<v Speaker 7>What did you find yourself alone?</v>

1827
01:24:04.770 --> 01:24:05.660
<v Speaker 6>And it was all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1828
01:24:05.670 --> 01:24:08.040
<v Speaker 6>at people feeling each other up and </v>
<v Speaker 6>drinking beers.</v>

1829
01:24:08.041 --> 01:24:11.850
<v Speaker 6>I snuck out of their dads kitchen the </v>
<v Speaker 6>best times of your life.</v>

1830
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:13.440
<v Speaker 6>Very strange times,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1831
01:24:13.650 --> 01:24:16.380
<v Speaker 6>very strange times.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't get much better than that,</v>

1832
01:24:16.710 --> 01:24:18.120
<v Speaker 6>sadly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1833
01:24:18.210 --> 01:24:20.430
<v Speaker 6>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was all very interesting.</v>

1834
01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:21.490
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1835
01:24:22.170 --> 01:24:27.170
<v Speaker 6>there was a kid who was a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 6>older than us that we knew that we were </v>

1836
01:24:27.170 --> 01:24:27.170
<v Speaker 6>hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

1837
01:24:27.170 --> 01:24:27.570
<v Speaker 6>It's right by the Charles River.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's where I grew up.</v>

1838
01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:30.450
<v Speaker 6>Q and a good job today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jamie's done the ball son.</v>

1839
01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:35.980
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's a kid who was in my </v>

1840
01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:36.510
<v Speaker 6>neighborhood who killed somebody drunk </v>
<v Speaker 6>driving and killed his best friend while</v>

1841
01:24:36.511 --> 01:24:38.940
<v Speaker 6>we were all in high school together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Leaving Echo Bridge.</v>

1842
01:24:38.970 --> 01:24:39.300
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1843
01:24:39.301 --> 01:24:41.400
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it was that kind of thing,</v>

1844
01:24:41.401 --> 01:24:42.780
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was like everybody was partying.</v>

1845
01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:45.870
<v Speaker 6>People are going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's all anybody wanted it to do.</v>

1846
01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:47.640
<v Speaker 6>So everybody's going to parties.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1847
01:24:47.641 --> 01:24:48.920
<v Speaker 6>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's having a party this weekend.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You go and dog,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's got a party.</v>

1849
01:24:50.101 --> 01:24:50.730
<v Speaker 6>We're gonna go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

1850
01:24:50.731 --> 01:24:52.470
<v Speaker 6>we got to find a place to party.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there was.</v>

1851
01:24:52.650 --> 01:24:55.150
<v Speaker 6>This is like the cave caveman days.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1852
01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:57.750
<v Speaker 6>We're talking about like the 19 eighties</v>
<v Speaker 6>people were cavemen.</v>

1853
01:24:57.930 --> 01:24:59.670
<v Speaker 6>No one had phones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was no,</v>

1854
01:24:59.671 --> 01:25:04.671
<v Speaker 6>there was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most people didn't even have fucking </v>

1855
01:25:04.671 --> 01:25:04.671
<v Speaker 6>answering machine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1856
01:25:04.671 --> 01:25:05.490
<v Speaker 6>no basic cable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You had like three channels.</v>

1857
01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:06.750
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1858
01:25:06.751 --> 01:25:11.751
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people would just wind up getting drunk </v>

1859
01:25:11.751 --> 01:25:14.400
<v Speaker 6>and they were kids and a lot of them </v>
<v Speaker 6>drove home drunk and I tried really hard</v>

1860
01:25:14.401 --> 01:25:16.770
<v Speaker 6>not to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm sure it probably did it at least</v>

1861
01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.590
<v Speaker 6>two or three times on when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 6>teenager.</v>

1862
01:25:19.591 --> 01:25:21.880
<v Speaker 6>I drove to the point where I definitely </v>
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't have been driving.</v>

1863
01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:26.960
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I drunk drove fucking three nights a </v>

1864
01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:26.960
<v Speaker 7>week,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like severely drunk.</v>

1865
01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:27.630
<v Speaker 7>It was crazy.</v>

1866
01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:30.630
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well Luckily I wasn't drinking that much</v>

1867
01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:35.660
<v Speaker 6>because it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right when I just started transitioning </v>

1868
01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:36.690
<v Speaker 6>to getting into martial arts and from </v>
<v Speaker 6>then on I pretty much stopped partying.</v>

1869
01:25:36.691 --> 01:25:41.691
<v Speaker 6>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it coincided with this dude around </v>

1870
01:25:41.691 --> 01:25:41.691
<v Speaker 6>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1871
01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:46.170
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure like numbers wise,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might be off by a year or two,</v>

1872
01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:50.760
<v Speaker 6>but it was around that area where I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>realizing that there was a lot of us.</v>

1873
01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:53.310
<v Speaker 6>They were like doing a really </v>
<v Speaker 6>irresponsible,</v>

1874
01:25:53.311 --> 01:25:58.311
<v Speaker 6>dangerous shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like driving drunk and being drunk all </v>

1875
01:25:58.311 --> 01:25:58.470
<v Speaker 6>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Going to these parties and having fun.</v>

1876
01:25:58.471 --> 01:26:00.980
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is like someone's going to drown so</v>

1877
01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:03.620
<v Speaker 6>it's going to fall off a roof,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some shit's going to go down.</v>

1878
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:08.980
<v Speaker 2>And then this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he hit a tree or something like </v>

1879
01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:10.100
<v Speaker 2>that and killed his best friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he survive?</v>

1880
01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:12.850
<v Speaker 2>He survived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1881
01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:15.860
<v Speaker 2>what a thing to live with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were all like,</v>

1882
01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:20.920
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cops actually broke it to them that </v>

1883
01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:20.920
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You killed your best friend.</v>

1884
01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:23.750
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what they said when he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out of the unconsciousness in the</v>

1885
01:26:23.751 --> 01:26:26.000
<v Speaker 2>hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they explained it to him.</v>

1886
01:26:26.150 --> 01:26:27.620
<v Speaker 2>You killed your restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

1887
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:30.830
<v Speaker 2>Jesus just probably blitzed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1888
01:26:30.831 --> 01:26:34.730
<v Speaker 2>And also probably if I had a guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was a little older than me.</v>

1889
01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:37.460
<v Speaker 2>I might've been like 17 at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was 18,</v>

1890
01:26:38.150 --> 01:26:40.550
<v Speaker 2>18 and it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's over kid,</v>

1891
01:26:41.130 --> 01:26:42.410
<v Speaker 2>maybe I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I have it wrong.</v>

1892
01:26:42.411 --> 01:26:45.470
<v Speaker 2>16 and 17.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was somewhere in that range of.</v>

1893
01:26:45.471 --> 01:26:50.471
<v Speaker 2>He's a young guy who was just starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to drive and now all of a sudden his </v>

1894
01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:52.940
<v Speaker 2>friend's dad and he's got that mark on </v>
<v Speaker 2>him for the rest of his life.</v>

1895
01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:54.980
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

1896
01:26:55.190 --> 01:26:58.970
<v Speaker 2>fuck drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck all this fuck pot.</v>

1897
01:26:59.030 --> 01:27:01.160
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to have nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

1898
01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:06.700
<v Speaker 2>anything that was going to ruin my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like you can really ruin your life </v>

1899
01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:08.240
<v Speaker 2>and other people's lives and the loved </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones with those other people.</v>

1900
01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1901
01:27:11.370 --> 01:27:14.540
<v Speaker 7>Lot of narrow escapes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think about the situations.</v>

1902
01:27:14.541 --> 01:27:15.950
<v Speaker 7>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a ripple effect.</v>

1903
01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:19.520
<v Speaker 7>You can change whole communities with </v>
<v Speaker 7>one action.</v>

1904
01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:22.790
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If I had a buddy growing up and he was a</v>

1905
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:27.940
<v Speaker 7>bad alcoholic ice to take an AA meetings</v>
<v Speaker 7>and people try to do interventions and </v>

1906
01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:29.700
<v Speaker 7>he was just really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>really chemically bad.</v>

1907
01:27:29.701 --> 01:27:32.000
<v Speaker 7>He was Jacqueline Hyde personality,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1908
01:27:32.001 --> 01:27:33.110
<v Speaker 7>he when,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when he was sober,</v>

1909
01:27:33.111 --> 01:27:38.111
<v Speaker 7>he was the greatest guy in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Loved hanging out with them and he gets </v>

1910
01:27:38.111 --> 01:27:38.420
<v Speaker 7>drunk and he tried to fight me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was crazy.</v>

1911
01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:43.840
<v Speaker 7>And so one night he was driving,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he had his girlfriend in the car and </v>

1912
01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:45.740
<v Speaker 7>they got into a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so like he left her,</v>

1913
01:27:45.741 --> 01:27:48.590
<v Speaker 7>she got out of the car and then he got </v>
<v Speaker 7>on the highway,</v>

1914
01:27:48.591 --> 01:27:50.330
<v Speaker 7>but then he stopped to go back and get </v>
<v Speaker 7>her.</v>

1915
01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:55.340
<v Speaker 7>So we got back on the highway going the </v>
<v Speaker 7>opposite direction and hit a car head on</v>

1916
01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:57.860
<v Speaker 7>and killed the two people and died.</v>

1917
01:27:58.270 --> 01:27:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

1918
01:27:59.590 --> 01:28:04.590
<v Speaker 7>And it was like the town still.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like his family is so intertwined </v>

1919
01:28:05.291 --> 01:28:07.310
<v Speaker 7>in my town,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1920
01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:11.140
<v Speaker 7>that it was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>almost like a political party there.</v>

1921
01:28:11.141 --> 01:28:11.950
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1922
01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:15.210
<v Speaker 2>part of it will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think about Ted Kennedy,</v>

1923
01:28:16.330 --> 01:28:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Ted Kennedy Day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep bringing them up,</v>

1924
01:28:18.190 --> 01:28:20.800
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that chappaquiddick thing.</v>

1925
01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Chappaquiddick bridge where he was drunk</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his car went into the water and his </v>

1926
01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:26.150
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend drowned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1927
01:28:26.650 --> 01:28:28.810
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't report it until hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

1928
01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Next morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1930
01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:36.620
<v Speaker 7>And end it with him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got the sense that he'd been driving </v>

1931
01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:36.620
<v Speaker 7>drunk every fucking night.</v>

01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:01.080
<v Speaker 2>I just went off the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drunk as fuck off the bridge.</v>

<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Some people carry stuff more than </v>

1945
01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:12.920
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

1946
01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:14.670
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't his bottom out point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1947
01:29:16.230 --> 01:29:18.290

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1948
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a lot to forget.</v>

1949
01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.170
<v Speaker 2>He had two brothers that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>assassinated.</v>

1950
01:29:22.650 --> 01:29:26.840
<v Speaker 2>The one who died flying a plane in world</v>
<v Speaker 2>war two or you know,</v>

<v Speaker 6>We've got to really.</v>

2022
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:23.120
<v Speaker 6>This might not work out.</v>

2023
01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:28.390
<v Speaker 7>I kinda miss that feeling.</v>

2025
01:32:29.051 --> 01:32:34.051
<v Speaker 7>I think you get three pickups a year and</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just always remember going over my </v>

<v Speaker 7>I'll tell you</v>

2028
01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:40.180
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do think that the character building </v>

2029
01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:43.830
<v Speaker 6>aspects of driving and a place where </v>
<v Speaker 6>your car could break down or get stuck </v>

2030
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:45.970
<v Speaker 6>in the snow and the ice that we </v>
<v Speaker 6>experienced when we were kids.</v>

2031
01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:51.510
<v Speaker 6>I think there is something that I really</v>
<v Speaker 6>benefited from that I've benefited from </v>

2032
01:32:51.510 --> 01:32:55.300
<v Speaker 6>being scared of the weather for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like an understanding like,</v>

2033
01:32:55.330 --> 01:32:57.910
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you drive out there tonight,</v>

2034
01:32:58.030 --> 01:32:59.950
<v Speaker 6>there's fucking four inches of snow on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the ground.</v>

2035
01:32:59.951 --> 01:33:02.560
<v Speaker 6>They haven't done any plowing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to run into some black eyes</v>

2036
01:33:02.561 --> 01:33:07.561
<v Speaker 6>too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because you know it was raining before </v>

<v Speaker 6>Got Cold enough to snow.</v>

2038
01:33:07.561 --> 01:33:09.310

<v Speaker 6>we're going to do this like nobody.</v>

2039
01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:11.470

<v Speaker 6>There's no.</v>

2040
01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:16.500
<v Speaker 6>You don't ever have to go out and wonder</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether or not you're going to stay on </v>

2041
01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:16.500
<v Speaker 6>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2042
01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:17.590

<v Speaker 6>were kids.</v>

2043
01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:23.250
<v Speaker 6>Couldn't.</v>

<v Speaker 6>But anyway,</v>

2075
01:34:48.911 --> 01:34:53.911
<v Speaker 6>we would go across that and then you </v>
<v Speaker 6>would go from this one stop all the way </v>

2076
01:34:54.821 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 6>to Bangor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was one exit and it was</v>

2077
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:01.850
<v Speaker 2>60 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was a long stretch.</v>

2078
01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:03.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably like 60 miles.</v>

2079
01:35:03.441 --> 01:35:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exaggerating,</v>

2080
01:35:04.701 --> 01:35:06.530
<v Speaker 2>am I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I am now.</v>

2081
01:35:06.531 --> 01:35:08.060
<v Speaker 2>We didn't think about that with those </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigs.</v>

2082
01:35:08.061 --> 01:35:13.061
<v Speaker 2>We never think thought about how far was</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just thought about date to write in </v>

2083
01:35:13.061 --> 01:35:13.061
<v Speaker 2>my calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2084
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:14.600
<v Speaker 2>You got a date?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got an open.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't care where it is.</v>

2086
01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:19.160
<v Speaker 2>No hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never a hotel.</v>

2087
01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:23.450
<v Speaker 2>That Balsam's thing was like the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gig you got that we stayed in a hotel.</v>

2088
01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a few for.</v>

<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>

2093
01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:40.620
<v Speaker 2>The forehead one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was in Maine and it was </v>

2094
01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:40.740
<v Speaker 2>actually like a pretty good gig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2095

<v Speaker 2>people that book gigs like build downs </v>

2100
01:35:56.700 --> 01:36:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd realize that they can make money </v>

2101
01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:04.660
<v Speaker 2>just by setting up these comedy nights </v>
<v Speaker 2>in these bars and so we would travel all</v>

<v Speaker 2>the original Irish spelling of it.</v>

2157
01:38:33.421 --> 01:38:35.490
<v Speaker 2>And when he came to us they added </v>
<v Speaker 2>another m.</v>

2158
01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:37.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

2159
01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Irish heavy community man.</v>

2160
01:38:42.930 --> 01:38:45.120
<v Speaker 2>Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So still to this day,</v>

2161
01:38:45.121 --> 01:38:46.500
<v Speaker 2>so Irish heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2162
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:49.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always interesting in the police force.</v>

2163
01:38:49.561 --> 01:38:53.270
<v Speaker 2>All fucking Irish cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>firemen,</v>

2164
01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:56.580
<v Speaker 2>lot of Irish in the Pharma Department.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politicians also.</v>

2165
01:38:56.581 --> 01:39:01.581
<v Speaker 2>Do you have like different flavors on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the east coast that you don't get a lot </v>

2166
01:39:01.581 --> 01:39:02.580
<v Speaker 2>on the west coast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Puerto Ricans,</v>

2167
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:04.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Puerto Ricans in New York,</v>

2168
01:39:04.741 --> 01:39:07.620
<v Speaker 2>they had a very real flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2169
01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:11.100
<v Speaker 2>This is like a layer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got style.</v>

2170
01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:14.850
<v Speaker 2>We have the Mexican like influence over </v>
<v Speaker 2>here on the west coast,</v>

2171
01:39:15.090 --> 01:39:16.680
<v Speaker 2>which is like a little bit more laid </v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

2172
01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:17.850
<v Speaker 2>very laid back.</v>

2173
01:39:17.850 --> 01:39:21.810
<v Speaker 2>Very like when you hear trump talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminals and shift from Mexico.</v>

2174
01:39:21.811 --> 01:39:24.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's diametrically the opposite of how</v>

2175
01:39:24.841 --> 01:39:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I picture Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2176
01:39:26.461 --> 01:39:27.840
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this criminals everywhere,</v>

2177
01:39:27.841 --> 01:39:32.340
<v Speaker 2>but I find that Mexican people that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>meet like especially like in America,</v>

2178
01:39:32.850 --> 01:39:37.850
<v Speaker 2>down to Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy to hang out with is very common </v>

2179
01:39:37.850 --> 01:39:37.850
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>family oriented,</v>

2180
01:39:37.850 --> 01:39:41.580
<v Speaker 2>very common friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard working work and sense of humor.</v>

2181
01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:45.000
<v Speaker 2>That's not a bad group of people by any </v>
<v Speaker 2>stretch of the imagination.</v>

2182
01:39:45.150 --> 01:39:50.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like what the Republicans say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want Christian families that stay </v>

2183
01:39:50.461 --> 01:39:53.460
<v Speaker 2>together and work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's you gotta.</v>

2184
01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans,</v>

2185
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2186
01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're brown though.</v>

2187
01:39:59.730 --> 01:40:01.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's really like they're from </v>
<v Speaker 2>over there.</v>

2188
01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:03.780
<v Speaker 2>It's so stupid.</v>

2257
01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:23.740

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2258

<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if it's the wrong one </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

2259
01:43:25.331 --> 01:43:30.331
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one thing that I like about trump </v>

2260
01:43:30.331 --> 01:43:33.181
<v Speaker 2>becoming president is the one thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like is that it throws the whole </v>

2261
01:43:33.181 --> 01:43:36.720
<v Speaker 2>fucking golf fucking food cart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just chucks it over.</v>

2262
01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Figure this mess out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2263
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:44.270
<v Speaker 2>and they've got to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up with a candidate that makes </v>

2264
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.350
<v Speaker 2>sense to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It already has though.</v>

2265
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:47.830
<v Speaker 2>I think the gop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gop new after the,</v>

2266
01:43:47.831 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 2>after Obama got elected twice the gop </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they needed</v>

2267
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:53.660
<v Speaker 7>the black vote,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the Latino vote,</v>

2268
01:43:53.661 --> 01:43:56.270
<v Speaker 7>they needed to come more to the center </v>
<v Speaker 7>and uh,</v>

2269
01:43:56.271 --> 01:44:01.271
<v Speaker 7>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so trump happened and now you gotta </v>

2270
01:44:01.271 --> 01:44:01.310
<v Speaker 7>think that trump is like the real slap </v>
<v Speaker 7>in the face.</v>

2271
01:44:01.311 --> 01:44:04.430
<v Speaker 7>They didn't receive after the black guy </v>
<v Speaker 7>won twice.</v>

2272
01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:06.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2273
01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:09.410
<v Speaker 7>They know they've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they've got a seriously.</v>

2274
01:44:10.030 --> 01:44:15.030
<v Speaker 7>They're to lighten up on some of these </v>
<v Speaker 7>social issues like abortion or gay </v>

2275
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:18.431
<v Speaker 7>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They gotta let it the fuck go and not </v>

2276
01:44:18.431 --> 01:44:18.860
<v Speaker 7>worry about bathrooms with a girl and a </v>
<v Speaker 7>boy is back.</v>

2277
01:44:18.861 --> 01:44:20.090
<v Speaker 7>Shut the fuck up.</v>

2278
01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:21.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

2279
01:44:22.290 --> 01:44:27.290
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's moving to immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Immigration is one that taps those </v>

2280
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:29.070
<v Speaker 5>primal fears of invaders and it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 5>real issue.</v>

2281
01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:30.720
<v Speaker 5>Faders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2282
01:44:32.970 --> 01:44:36.900
<v Speaker 5>They're taking jobs and they're raping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They take all the fruit off the trees.</v>

2283
01:44:38.450 --> 01:44:43.450
<v Speaker 5>The trees are bearing the invaders of </v>
<v Speaker 5>taking all the good.</v>

2284
01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:47.760
<v Speaker 5>That's a weird thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like these are the last hold outs</v>

2285
01:44:47.761 --> 01:44:52.761
<v Speaker 5>to the inevitable conclusion that </v>
<v Speaker 5>borders are retarded and we can't have </v>

2286
01:44:52.761 --> 01:44:54.690
<v Speaker 5>borders anymore if we all want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretend to be even.</v>

<v Speaker 5>same way.</v>

2289
01:45:01.651 --> 01:45:03.930
<v Speaker 5>We want Japan to cheat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to treat China,</v>

2290
01:45:04.170 --> 01:45:09.170
<v Speaker 5>that everybody just treat everybody like</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would if we were one gigantic </v>

<v Speaker 5>We're going to put up a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey had the same opportunities as us and</v>

2304
01:45:36.751 --> 01:45:39.180
<v Speaker 5>they squandered them squandered for </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>

2305
01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:44.300
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand the impulse to do that </v>

2306
01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:47.151
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand if you're the person who </v>

2307
01:45:47.151 --> 01:45:49.191
<v Speaker 5>doesn't want your house broken into or </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're the rich guy lives really close </v>

2308
01:45:49.191 --> 01:45:49.680
<v Speaker 5>to San Diego and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck that.</v>

2309
01:45:49.681 --> 01:45:52.140
<v Speaker 5>Keep them over there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get the sentiment.</v>

2310
01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:57.380
<v Speaker 5>But when you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you take yourself out of the picture </v>

2311
01:45:57.380 --> 01:45:58.320
<v Speaker 5>and you look at the overall picture of </v>
<v Speaker 5>human beings on the planet,</v>

2312
01:45:59.010 --> 01:46:00.690
<v Speaker 5>inevitably those things are going away.</v>

2313
01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:05.040
<v Speaker 5>This is only a matter of tower of Babel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got a,</v>

2314
01:46:05.290 --> 01:46:08.370

<v Speaker 5>a that has writing on it and it </v>

01:47:34.621 --> 01:47:36.720
<v Speaker 2>comes to this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing.</v>

2346
01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:41.750
<v Speaker 2>All of these things in theory should </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring us together and break down </v>

2347
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:42.060
<v Speaker 2>barriers.</v>

2352
01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Hilton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had him on the podcast before </v>

2353
01:47:56.630 --> 01:47:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Hilton hotels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he know he,</v>

2354
01:47:56.630 --> 01:47:58.260
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a politician from England.</v>

2355
01:47:58.590 --> 01:48:01.280
<v Speaker 2>It was her while he was David Cameron's </v>
<v Speaker 2>righthand man.</v>

2356
01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now he runs this thing.</v>

2357
01:48:03.570 --> 01:48:07.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm over in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He runs a startup called CROWDPAC.</v>

2358
01:48:08.230 --> 01:48:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of can find out what the </v>

2359
01:48:13.230 --> 01:48:13.470
<v Speaker 2>candidates stand for you like you put in</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you stand for,</v>

2360
01:48:13.490 --> 01:48:16.500
<v Speaker 2>like what heard about green,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tells you what you should vote for.</v>

2361
01:48:16.750 --> 01:48:19.380
<v Speaker 2>One candidate best represents your </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions on these things.</v>

2362
01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:22.950
<v Speaker 2>But he actually thinks that the brexit </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is a good idea.</v>

2363
01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:25.320
<v Speaker 2>I haven't talked to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2364
01:48:26.130 --> 01:48:27.800
<v Speaker 2>I know that's what his opinion is and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to,</v>

2365
01:48:27.801 --> 01:48:30.390
<v Speaker 2>I would like to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to know what that because I don't</v>

2366
01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:31.200
<v Speaker 2>have an opinion.</v>

2367
01:48:31.230 --> 01:48:32.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

2368
01:48:32.911 --> 01:48:37.911
<v Speaker 2>I understand that they don't want people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to immigrate freely all </v>

2369
01:48:37.911 --> 01:48:41.301
<v Speaker 2>throughout Europe and come to the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were England had an issue and I </v>

2370
01:48:41.301 --> 01:48:42.090
<v Speaker 2>understand that some people think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>

2371
01:48:42.590 --> 01:48:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know enough of it to have an</v>

2372
01:48:46.111 --> 01:48:48.360
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a populist movement.</v>

2373
01:48:48.361 --> 01:48:52.620
<v Speaker 2>I think it got a lot of energy from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong people and if the focus was on the</v>

2374
01:48:52.621 --> 01:48:54.960
<v Speaker 2>wrong parts of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but economically,</v>

2375
01:48:54.961 --> 01:48:58.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pound dropped in value.</v>

2376
01:48:58.530 --> 01:49:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Where are the euro dropped in value when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pulled out?</v>

2377
01:49:02.010 --> 01:49:02.940
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2378
01:49:02.941 --> 01:49:07.941
<v Speaker 2>a lot of countries said they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do business with England for a </v>

2379
01:49:07.941 --> 01:49:07.941
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to punish them.</v>

2380
01:49:07.941 --> 01:49:08.100
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is what I'm saying.</v>

2381
01:49:08.101 --> 01:49:10.710
<v Speaker 2>If you look at what we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking about borders,</v>

2382
01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:14.310
<v Speaker 2>that's essentially like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a dissolving of borders,</v>

2383
01:49:14.730 --> 01:49:15.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2384
01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:20.000
<v Speaker 2>That's essentially what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're just going to start saying </v>

2385
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.941
<v Speaker 2>these borders don't mean anything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can move to wherever the fuck you </v>

2386
01:49:22.941 --> 01:49:23.070
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just pop back and forth from each one of</v>

2387
01:49:23.071 --> 01:49:24.120
<v Speaker 2>these countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Europe,</v>

2388
01:49:24.150 --> 01:49:29.150
<v Speaker 2>we're a union like the United States in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of ways and really probably how </v>

2389
01:49:29.791 --> 01:49:31.440
<v Speaker 2>much bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's bigger?</v>

2390
01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:35.580
<v Speaker 2>All of Europe in the European Union or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the continental United States.</v>

2391
01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:39.330
<v Speaker 2>What's bigger physically?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2392
01:49:39.450 --> 01:49:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Russia's got a ton of fucking land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it's just ice.</v>

2393
01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as Russia considered Europe?</v>

2394
01:49:44.281 --> 01:49:45.900
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it Asia?</v>

2395
01:49:46.230 --> 01:49:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Russia is Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

2396
01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2397
01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:50.410
<v Speaker 6>Oh no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2398
01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:52.280
<v Speaker 6>See we're learning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You didn't know him.</v>

2399
01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:54.460
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was pretty Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dare you racist.</v>

2400
01:49:54.490 --> 01:49:59.490
<v Speaker 6>You're so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're white because you can be </v>

2401
01:49:59.490 --> 01:49:59.490
<v Speaker 6>ignorant about them and no one gives a </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

2402
01:49:59.490 --> 01:50:00.100
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2403
01:50:00.101 --> 01:50:01.660
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because the Russians are white,</v>

2404
01:50:01.670 --> 01:50:03.130
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>called a racist.</v>

2405
01:50:03.490 --> 01:50:05.140
<v Speaker 6>How big is United States compared to </v>
<v Speaker 6>Europe?</v>

2406
01:50:05.290 --> 01:50:07.690
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>United States is 9 million.</v>

2407
01:50:07.691 --> 01:50:10.420
<v Speaker 6>One hundred 61,923</v>
<v Speaker 6>kilometers.</v>

2408
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:13.990
<v Speaker 6>Europe is 3 million.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we're 788.</v>

2409
01:50:13.991 --> 01:50:15.220
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're three times larger.</v>

2410
01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:17.590
<v Speaker 6>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean close to it at least.</v>

2411
01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:19.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2412
01:50:19.090 --> 01:50:20.830
<v Speaker 6>Two and a half times the size of </v>
<v Speaker 6>European Union.</v>

2413
01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:23.050
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But either way that's a.</v>

2414
01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:28.260
<v Speaker 6>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're talking about two fairly large </v>

2415
01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:30.451
<v Speaker 6>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Still reeling from the fact that </v>

2416
01:50:30.451 --> 01:50:34.200
<v Speaker 6>Russia's not in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't fucking believe that I'm this </v>

<v Speaker 6>masterpiece.</v>

2429
01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:11.350
<v Speaker 6>It's a masterpiece.</v>

<v Speaker 6>conquered.</v>

2433
01:51:18.401 --> 01:51:20.530

<v Speaker 6>So Moscow's the European part,</v>

2443
01:51:43.811 --> 01:51:44.890
<v Speaker 6>close to that.</v>

01:51:46.930 --> 01:51:50.650
<v Speaker 6>So is that all that all that sounded </v>
<v Speaker 6>knowing that much about the globe,</v>

2446
01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:53.230
<v Speaker 6>even though I do know the earth is flat </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I go on Youtube,</v>

2447
01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:56.020
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ms dot paying attention to that.</v>

2448
01:51:56.120 --> 01:51:56.950
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

01:51:56.951 --> 01:51:59.770
<v Speaker 6>you don't know now you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't know.</v>

2450
01:51:59.771 --> 01:52:04.771
<v Speaker 6>There's a fucking enormous group of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people in America in 2016 to think the </v>

2451
01:52:04.961 --> 01:52:08.440
<v Speaker 6>earth is flat and that is a big </v>
<v Speaker 6>conspiracy where Haley,</v>

2452
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:12.010
<v Speaker 6>there's tons of videos on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's tons of videos on how satellites</v>

2453
01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:15.310
<v Speaker 6>are not real,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but their planes in low earth orbit,</v>

2454
01:52:15.311 --> 01:52:17.820
<v Speaker 6>they just keep flying around </v>
<v Speaker 6>transmitting data.</v>

2455
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:22.830
<v Speaker 6>They just constantly find these planes </v>
<v Speaker 6>around lying about their being </v>

2456
01:52:22.830 --> 01:52:22.830
<v Speaker 6>satellites.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2457
01:52:22.830 --> 01:52:23.080
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's it,</v>

2458
01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:28.100
<v Speaker 6>you know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like hipsters that are dressing </v>

2459
01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:30.871
<v Speaker 6>like the from the 18 hundreds and </v>
<v Speaker 6>cooking like different 18 and now </v>

2460
01:52:30.871 --> 01:52:34.000
<v Speaker 6>they're going to go back to scientific </v>
<v Speaker 6>beliefs from the 19th century.</v>

2461
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:35.680
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at all.</v>

2462
01:52:35.681 --> 01:52:37.990
<v Speaker 6>It's all connected back up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're young.</v>

2463
01:52:37.991 --> 01:52:42.991
<v Speaker 6>Jamie Lukow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>China just sort of rolls into Europe </v>

2464
01:52:42.991 --> 01:52:47.191
<v Speaker 6>like that and that's why when you look </v>
<v Speaker 6>at the,</v>

2465
01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:53.770
<v Speaker 6>all the different kinds of languages to </v>
<v Speaker 6>exist in that one area right now,</v>

2466
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:57.790
<v Speaker 7>it's a ton of languages and it used to </v>
<v Speaker 7>be a ton of currencies.</v>

2467
01:52:57.791 --> 01:52:58.840
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I try.</v>

2468
01:52:58.870 --> 01:53:03.870
<v Speaker 7>I remember traveling around Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had a backpack for six months when I </v>

2469
01:53:03.870 --> 01:53:06.790
<v Speaker 7>was 18 and I just hopped around and my </v>
<v Speaker 7>biggest nightmare was changed.</v>

2470
01:53:06.791 --> 01:53:11.791
<v Speaker 7>Going from Belgium to fucking Holland to</v>
<v Speaker 7>London to front every day you had more </v>

2471
01:53:11.791 --> 01:53:16.771
<v Speaker 7>money than you had spent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So now you got these Franks he can't </v>

2472
01:53:16.771 --> 01:53:17.930
<v Speaker 7>fucking use,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you've already paid a commission to,</v>

2473
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:23.000
<v Speaker 7>to get your money into French francs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now you've got to pay money to convert </v>

2474
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.851
<v Speaker 7>it to pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you're getting double whacked on </v>

2475
01:53:26.851 --> 01:53:28.210
<v Speaker 7>every transition.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

2476
01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:30.190
<v Speaker 7>it was fucking huge pain in the ass.</v>

2477
01:53:31.610 --> 01:53:36.610
<v Speaker 6>I'll just try and do is get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so then they switched over to the </v>

2478
01:53:36.610 --> 01:53:36.610
<v Speaker 6>euro,</v>
<v Speaker 6>made everything way easier.</v>

2479
01:53:36.610 --> 01:53:39.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But now that England bailed,</v>

2480
01:53:39.570 --> 01:53:42.150
<v Speaker 6>no more European Unions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so no more euro either.</v>

2481
01:53:42.930 --> 01:53:44.690
<v Speaker 7>Now the day you got to keep using the </v>
<v Speaker 7>euro,</v>

2482
01:53:44.730 --> 01:53:47.760
<v Speaker 7>d c is going to continue on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're just not going to have England</v>

2483
01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:51.360
<v Speaker 6>part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm saying no more euro in England.</v>

2484
01:53:51.530 --> 01:53:53.390
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think England ever converted.</v>

2485
01:53:53.391 --> 01:53:55.130
<v Speaker 7>I think they stayed with the pound all </v>
<v Speaker 7>this time.</v>

2486
01:53:55.131 --> 01:53:56.660
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they were always half in.</v>

2487
01:53:56.661 --> 01:53:56.770
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2488
01:53:56.850 --> 01:53:58.000

<v Speaker 6>inbred queen on a five quid notes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've thought it over and decided to </v>

<v Speaker 6>Are you going to address your </v>

2496
01:54:28.730 --> 01:54:29.940
<v Speaker 6>fundamentalist problem?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes or no?</v>

2497
01:54:30.570 --> 01:54:33.540
<v Speaker 6>We will no longer be backing up your </v>
<v Speaker 6>socialist program.</v>

2498
01:54:33.850 --> 01:54:37.260
<v Speaker 6>MMM,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but one day it's going to be what it is,</v>

2499
01:54:37.261 --> 01:54:42.261
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>One day they're going to figure out how </v>

2500
01:54:42.261 --> 01:54:43.620
<v Speaker 6>to get the whole thing and make it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One might not be in our lifetime,</v>

2501
01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:49.400
<v Speaker 6>might be a 100 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Will they abandoned the idea of that's </v>

2502
01:54:50.131 --> 01:54:51.720
<v Speaker 6>the only way things are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>fair.</v>

2503
01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:54.780
<v Speaker 6>It's like now because the one way thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>is things are not fair.</v>

2504
01:54:54.781 --> 01:54:59.781
<v Speaker 6>If you live in a really shitty country,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're really a war torn part of the </v>

2505
01:54:59.781 --> 01:55:00.930
<v Speaker 6>world or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not allowed to just move anywhere</v>

2506
01:55:00.931 --> 01:55:01.820
<v Speaker 6>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2507
01:55:02.190 --> 01:55:03.730
<v Speaker 6>because everybody would just live in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Miami.</v>

2508
01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:09.480
<v Speaker 6>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're just a good spot and they were </v>

2509
01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:10.660
<v Speaker 6>just so overwhelmed that bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2510
01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:15.090
<v Speaker 6>they're just fucking float on over and </v>
<v Speaker 6>Miami would just be like a crazy market.</v>

2511
01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:20.260
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It would just be chickens running </v>

2512
01:55:20.260 --> 01:55:20.700
<v Speaker 6>through the streets and people playing </v>
<v Speaker 6>music in their underwear.</v>

2513
01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:23.940
<v Speaker 6>Way more extreme than it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shoulder to shoulder on the beach.</v>

2514
01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:26.490
<v Speaker 6>You'd never get anywhere if you like </v>
<v Speaker 6>Rio,</v>

2515
01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:32.060
<v Speaker 6>but Kansas would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she always took global warming kicks in </v>

2516
01:55:32.221 --> 01:55:34.200
<v Speaker 6>and everybody's heading up to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking Midwest.</v>

2517
01:55:35.170 --> 01:55:40.170
<v Speaker 6>Wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that's sort of how it's always </v>

2518
01:55:40.170 --> 01:55:40.170
<v Speaker 6>been.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not excusing people.</v>

2519
01:55:40.170 --> 01:55:43.380
<v Speaker 6>One thing that I think gets lost,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this whole climate change debate,</v>

2520
01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:49.580
<v Speaker 5>climate change for the record I think is</v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely real and I think it's </v>

2521
01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:55.220
<v Speaker 5>definitely being a being affected by </v>
<v Speaker 5>human beings and pollution and what </v>

2522
01:55:57.151 --> 01:55:58.830
<v Speaker 5>we're doing to the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's.</v>

2523
01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:03.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's deniable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think that that said,</v>

2524
01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:06.150
<v Speaker 5>we should also look at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forget about what people have done.</v>

2525
01:56:06.570 --> 01:56:11.570
<v Speaker 5>I think just we should also be aware </v>
<v Speaker 5>that this fucking thing changes and it </v>

2526
01:56:11.570 --> 01:56:16.491
<v Speaker 5>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's ice ages back when people were </v>

2527
01:56:16.491 --> 01:56:19.101
<v Speaker 5>knocking sticks together and hoping to </v>
<v Speaker 5>start a fire and still created a nice </v>

2528
01:56:19.101 --> 01:56:19.650
<v Speaker 5>age,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had nothing to do with people.</v>

2529
01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:24.980
<v Speaker 5>The thing fluctuates,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it gets weird and you can go through </v>

2530
01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:28.650
<v Speaker 5>periods where North America is covered </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a mile high sheet of ice.</v>

2531
01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:30.690
<v Speaker 5>Like was the case 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

2532
01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:33.360
<v Speaker 5>That's hard to for people to get in </v>
<v Speaker 5>their heads.</v>

2533
01:56:33.361 --> 01:56:36.030
<v Speaker 5>Ten thousand years ago we weren't doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything as far as cars.</v>

2534
01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:37.290
<v Speaker 5>There was net hairspray.</v>

2535
01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:42.380
<v Speaker 5>We weren't shitting on the earth at all </v>
<v Speaker 5>and there was a mile high sheet of ice </v>

2536
01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:44.760
<v Speaker 5>that covered most of North America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2537
01:56:44.910 --> 01:56:47.910
<v Speaker 5>that's the Great Lakes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all that those flatlands,</v>

2538
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.260
<v Speaker 5>those were plowed over by giant glaciers</v>
<v Speaker 5>just smoosh the earth.</v>

2539
01:56:52.690 --> 01:56:54.360
<v Speaker 5>That was 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

2540
01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:56.700
<v Speaker 5>There's statues from 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

2541
01:56:57.090 --> 01:57:00.660
<v Speaker 5>There's shit in Turkey that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've discovered that 3000 years older</v>

2542
01:57:00.661 --> 01:57:02.880
<v Speaker 5>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so during that time,</v>

2543
01:57:02.910 --> 01:57:05.640
<v Speaker 5>without people doing anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's changed radically,</v>

2544
01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:10.700
<v Speaker 5>so I'm not exonerating people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm saying what be a real fucking </v>

2545
01:57:10.700 --> 01:57:14.250
<v Speaker 5>stupid part of this global warming </v>
<v Speaker 5>climate change issue is that it's become</v>

2546
01:57:14.251 --> 01:57:17.190
<v Speaker 5>some sort of an ideological debate </v>
<v Speaker 5>between the left and the right,</v>

2547
01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:22.420
<v Speaker 5>the left to blame everything on on </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and the right who say it's all </v>

2548
01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:26.451
<v Speaker 5>bullshit or some of them say it's all </v>
<v Speaker 5>bullshit or offer solutions that really </v>

2549
01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:28.800
<v Speaker 5>don't take into account the environment </v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

2550
01:57:28.801 --> 01:57:31.740
<v Speaker 5>but the reality is this fucking planet </v>
<v Speaker 5>is volatile,</v>

2551
01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:32.280
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2552
01:57:32.290 --> 01:57:37.290
<v Speaker 5>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's become a debate where one side has </v>

2553
01:57:37.290 --> 01:57:37.920
<v Speaker 5>to negate the other side for their truth</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be the only truth.</v>

2554
01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:39.480
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2555
01:57:39.481 --> 01:57:40.980
<v Speaker 5>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that does happen with people,</v>

2556
01:57:40.981 --> 01:57:41.840
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We.</v>

2557
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:44.940
<v Speaker 5>We get super rigid and not just an </v>
<v Speaker 5>opinion,</v>

2558
01:57:44.941 --> 01:57:48.450
<v Speaker 5>but in a side and aside to take.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we have to be whoever,</v>

2559
01:57:48.630 --> 01:57:50.820
<v Speaker 5>whoever's right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoever the wrong about global warming,</v>

2560
01:57:50.970 --> 01:57:55.970
<v Speaker 5>we have to fucking wake up as so how </v>
<v Speaker 5>much resources we have left and how </v>

2561
01:57:55.970 --> 01:57:57.540
<v Speaker 5>quickly we burned in them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2562
01:57:57.710 --> 01:57:59.610
<v Speaker 5>because there was this something about </v>
<v Speaker 5>China,</v>

2563
01:57:59.730 --> 01:58:03.390
<v Speaker 5>one area of China that's dangerously </v>
<v Speaker 5>close to having.</v>

2564
01:58:03.391 --> 01:58:07.500
<v Speaker 5>It's a oceans ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Completely collapsed due to overfishing.</v>

2565
01:58:07.850 --> 01:58:08.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Feel like.</v>

2566
01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:10.770
<v Speaker 5>Because you think about what the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2567
01:58:10.771 --> 01:58:11.250
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>

2568
01:58:11.251 --> 01:58:16.251
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's turn the ocean into instead of </v>

2569
01:58:16.251 --> 01:58:16.251
<v Speaker 5>this gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>massive water,</v>

2570
01:58:16.251 --> 01:58:16.900
<v Speaker 5>let's just have it a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

2571
01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:22.440
<v Speaker 5>a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The size of this room and all these </v>

2572
01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:25.281
<v Speaker 5>little fish in here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking and making new fish and then we </v>

2573
01:58:25.281 --> 01:58:26.030
<v Speaker 5>throw in a few little tiny boats with </v>
<v Speaker 5>scoopers in them.</v>

2574
01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:26.630
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2575
01:58:26.631 --> 01:58:31.631
<v Speaker 5>there's scuba round and scoop fish up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just scoop fish up and hopefully scoop </v>

2576
01:58:31.801 --> 01:58:36.801
<v Speaker 5>fish up in enough time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That gives the remaining fish time to </v>

2577
01:58:36.801 --> 01:58:40.761
<v Speaker 5>fuck and make more fish and then they </v>
<v Speaker 5>scoop fish up and then they scoop fish </v>

2578
01:58:40.761 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 5>up and they keep doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how long can</v>

2579
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.260
<v Speaker 6>you do that before there's no more fish?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2580
01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:48.520
<v Speaker 6>it turns out it's about 50,</v>
<v Speaker 6>60 years and where they are at right now</v>

2581
01:58:48.590 --> 01:58:50.620
<v Speaker 6>is there's some places that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>collapsing.</v>

2582
01:58:51.010 --> 01:58:51.550
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

2583
01:58:51.551 --> 01:58:52.740
<v Speaker 6>there's no more fish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2584
01:58:52.930 --> 01:58:55.840
<v Speaker 6>because it's not just a fisher catching,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the ones that feed on them.</v>

2585
01:58:56.710 --> 01:58:57.580
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not only that,</v>

2586
01:58:57.581 --> 01:59:02.581
<v Speaker 6>it's like there's no sustainability plan</v>
<v Speaker 6>and a lot of parts of the world is suck </v>

2587
01:59:02.581 --> 01:59:07.231
<v Speaker 6>out as much as you can fuck the world </v>
<v Speaker 6>and just do it because that's how you </v>

2588
01:59:07.231 --> 01:59:09.280
<v Speaker 6>make a profit and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're just international,</v>

2589
01:59:09.490 --> 01:59:12.370
<v Speaker 6>international waters.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's like all this.</v>

2590
01:59:12.371 --> 01:59:14.750
<v Speaker 6>A real weird debate about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2591
01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:19.760
<v Speaker 6>how you can control people fishing and </v>
<v Speaker 6>what you can do and they have a hard </v>

2592
01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:23.101
<v Speaker 6>enough time like sea shepherd has a hard</v>
<v Speaker 6>enough time catching people killing </v>

2593
01:59:23.101 --> 01:59:26.731
<v Speaker 6>whales.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know how they're getting away </v>

2594
01:59:26.731 --> 01:59:26.731
<v Speaker 6>with killing whales?</v>

2595
01:59:26.731 --> 01:59:27.790
<v Speaker 6>They pretend that it's scientific </v>
<v Speaker 6>research.</v>

2596
01:59:29.310 --> 01:59:34.310
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because every country is allotted 20 </v>

2597
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.310
<v Speaker 6>wells a year or so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2598
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:38.250
<v Speaker 6>So these boats go out and they slaughter</v>
<v Speaker 6>whales for scientific research and then </v>

2599
01:59:38.250 --> 01:59:39.150
<v Speaker 6>they sell their bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2600
01:59:40.730 --> 01:59:45.730
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like a loophole that allows them </v>

2601
01:59:45.730 --> 01:59:45.730
<v Speaker 6>the profit still off killing whales.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like,</v>

2602
01:59:45.730 --> 01:59:50.010
<v Speaker 6>you could never do that if I could,</v>
<v Speaker 6>will was like a land creature in North </v>

2603
01:59:50.010 --> 01:59:50.320
<v Speaker 6>America where,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2604
01:59:50.321 --> 01:59:55.321
<v Speaker 6>it was this beautiful thing that walked </v>
<v Speaker 6>by when and we knew there was like only </v>

2605
01:59:55.321 --> 01:59:56.130
<v Speaker 6>a few of them left.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2606
01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:57.640
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>keep that thing alive.</v>

2607
01:59:57.670 --> 01:59:59.710
<v Speaker 6>How cool it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They never heard people.</v>

2608
02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:01.390
<v Speaker 6>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they only eat plants.</v>

2609
02:00:01.391 --> 02:00:03.490
<v Speaker 6>Know what happened to the orcas at </v>
<v Speaker 6>seaworld.</v>

2610
02:00:03.491 --> 02:00:08.491
<v Speaker 6>People are boycotting the park because a</v>
<v Speaker 6>couple of them died and it should </v>

2611
02:00:08.770 --> 02:00:10.570
<v Speaker 6>because they were on earth because they </v>
<v Speaker 6>were on land.</v>

2612
02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:11.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well not only that,</v>

2613
02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:14.850
<v Speaker 6>I'm one of them tried to kill themselves</v>
<v Speaker 6>themselves.</v>

2614
02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:15.550
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2615
02:00:15.551 --> 02:00:19.580
<v Speaker 6>And one of them like came out of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>container and laid on the ground,</v>

2616
02:00:19.630 --> 02:00:22.060
<v Speaker 6>tried to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it makes sense,</v>

2617
02:00:22.061 --> 02:00:24.700
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're supposed to be smart.</v>

2618
02:00:26.260 --> 02:00:31.260
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's tough because the ocean doesn't </v>

2619
02:00:31.260 --> 02:00:33.061
<v Speaker 6>have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean he'd go back to borders at least </v>

2620
02:00:33.061 --> 02:00:33.061
<v Speaker 6>if you've got a border around a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 6>ocean,</v>

2621
02:00:33.061 --> 02:00:36.430
<v Speaker 6>you can say we can save our piece of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>ocean.</v>

2622
02:00:36.850 --> 02:00:39.520
<v Speaker 6>But if China does that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's ripple effects and eventually it</v>

2623
02:00:39.521 --> 02:00:41.190
<v Speaker 6>affects all the oceans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2624
02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:44.260
<v Speaker 6>You can't tell people where to go unless</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have guns.</v>

2625
02:00:44.610 --> 02:00:46.120
<v Speaker 6>If they come over in a battleship,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2626
02:00:46.150 --> 02:00:46.960
<v Speaker 6>That's where we can tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

2627
02:00:46.961 --> 02:00:47.920
<v Speaker 6>fuck face.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2628
02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:53.220
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but have like a fishing boat probably </v>

2629
02:00:53.220 --> 02:00:53.220
<v Speaker 6>get pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2630
02:00:53.220 --> 02:00:56.940
<v Speaker 6>but they must have like waters that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>designated for international fishing.</v>

2631
02:00:58.210 --> 02:00:58.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There is</v>

2632
02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:03.200
<v Speaker 2>looking at part of the problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>marine life and whatnot,</v>

2633
02:01:03.201 --> 02:01:06.590
<v Speaker 2>and I got to this article that says that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing land reclamation,</v>

2634
02:01:06.591 --> 02:01:11.591
<v Speaker 2>which is also destroying what things are</v>
<v Speaker 2>adding new islands in an area in between</v>

2635
02:01:11.931 --> 02:01:13.850
<v Speaker 2>different countries where they already </v>
<v Speaker 2>have islands,</v>

2636
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:17.810
<v Speaker 2>which is a breaking some international </v>
<v Speaker 2>water laws,</v>

2637
02:01:17.811 --> 02:01:19.250
<v Speaker 2>which is what you guys were just talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

2638
02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:22.400
<v Speaker 2>The United Nations is mad at them for </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this because it's.</v>

2639
02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:27.750
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like it's kind of blocking off</v>
<v Speaker 2>area that should be open for anybody to </v>

2640
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:27.750
<v Speaker 2>navigate.</v>

2641
02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:28.920
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's interesting.</v>

2642
02:01:28.921 --> 02:01:33.921
<v Speaker 6>So they're closing off channels for </v>
<v Speaker 6>various for various reasons and they're </v>

2643
02:01:33.921 --> 02:01:34.970
<v Speaker 6>calling it land reclamation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2644
02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:37.620
<v Speaker 6>I was trying to find out what they were </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing with the land.</v>

2645
02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:39.530
<v Speaker 6>How do you make an island?</v>

2646
02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:43.760
<v Speaker 6>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you have a barge and you just shoot</v>

2647
02:01:43.761 --> 02:01:47.920
<v Speaker 6>sand until you just keep pumping.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just throw all your pool.</v>

2648
02:01:48.890 --> 02:01:53.890
<v Speaker 6>We have to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have to deal with a billion people's </v>

2649
02:01:53.890 --> 02:01:53.890
<v Speaker 6>poop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What should we do with it?</v>

2650
02:01:53.890 --> 02:01:55.790
<v Speaker 6>Let's just make an island.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's make mushroom island.</v>

2651
02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:58.540
<v Speaker 6>Just fucking stack it up in a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>magic mushrooms.</v>

2652
02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:00.690
<v Speaker 6>We've seen that one in Dubai.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2653
02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:02.630
<v Speaker 6>There's just a series of islands.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's two of them.</v>

2654
02:02:02.631 --> 02:02:05.780
<v Speaker 6>One of them that looks like the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like all the continents,</v>

2655
02:02:06.060 --> 02:02:08.140
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are they floating or those?</v>

2656
02:02:08.150 --> 02:02:10.700
<v Speaker 6>Granted,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not whether they're grounded,</v>

2657
02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:12.890
<v Speaker 6>but they built them up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2658
02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:14.120
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2659
02:02:14.121 --> 02:02:16.370
<v Speaker 6>it's so cocky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Any fucking change.</v>

2660
02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:19.040
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have a sea wall around them and see</v>

2661
02:02:19.041 --> 02:02:24.041
<v Speaker 6>how the sea wall has like those little </v>
<v Speaker 6>vents or water could come in and water </v>

2662
02:02:24.041 --> 02:02:25.010
<v Speaker 6>can come out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it'll stop like a giant surge.</v>

2663
02:02:25.190 --> 02:02:27.560
<v Speaker 6>So it allows water to escape so they </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't get overwhelmed.</v>

2664
02:02:27.630 --> 02:02:29.180
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really interesting the design,</v>

2665
02:02:29.181 --> 02:02:30.490
<v Speaker 6>but most people think it's not going.</v>

2666
02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:35.220
<v Speaker 4>Mother's got to take it off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take it back,</v>

2667
02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:38.100
<v Speaker 4>going to take it all back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she took him down here.</v>

2668
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:40.030
<v Speaker 4>Mother's going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2669
02:02:40.031 --> 02:02:42.420
<v Speaker 4>I think I want to clean today.</v>

2670
02:02:44.770 --> 02:02:49.770
<v Speaker 6>Give me that seawall.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's just pulling out bentleys and </v>

2671
02:02:50.331 --> 02:02:55.331
<v Speaker 6>Gucci bags and she is doing a concert </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

2672
02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:00.100
<v Speaker 4>Dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sucks them into our water.</v>

2673
02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:01.930
<v Speaker 4>Ask.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's try it again.</v>

2674
02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:05.060
<v Speaker 4>Take you down to the raw molecules and </v>
<v Speaker 4>try again.</v>

2675
02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:09.040
<v Speaker 4>The patriots suck sand from one part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ocean and blast.</v>

2676
02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:11.190
<v Speaker 6>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2677
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.740
<v Speaker 6>Scroll down so I can read what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It says,</v>

2678
02:03:13.741 --> 02:03:17.250
<v Speaker 6>this added 144 miles of shoreline to </v>
<v Speaker 6>Dubai.</v>

2679
02:03:17.970 --> 02:03:21.660
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One hundred 44 miles of sand.</v>

2680
02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:25.610

<v Speaker 4>They're just sucking sand.</v>

2681
02:03:25.810 --> 02:03:28.240
<v Speaker 4>There's living things and that sand at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bottom of the ocean.</v>

2682
02:03:28.241 --> 02:03:30.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

<v Speaker 4>have.</v>

2684
02:03:33.730 --> 02:03:38.730
<v Speaker 4>Dubai is like a fascinating exercise in </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you can do if you have all the </v>

2685
02:03:38.730 --> 02:03:41.170
<v Speaker 4>money and no class,</v>

<v Speaker 6>They either fly him over here or they </v>

2697

<v Speaker 6>Everything goes through like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2870
02:12:23.201 --> 02:12:24.020
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got it.</v>

2871
02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:29.440
<v Speaker 6>So like insecurity is all this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a guard that's constantly on the </v>

2872
02:12:29.811 --> 02:12:34.811
<v Speaker 6>lookout for your peace of mind and for </v>
<v Speaker 6>your go eat your self esteem and for </v>

2873
02:12:37.131 --> 02:12:38.550
<v Speaker 6>your relaxation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's good.</v>

2874
02:12:38.570 --> 02:12:39.730
<v Speaker 6>Got You covered.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've got you covered this.</v>

2875
02:12:39.770 --> 02:12:44.770
<v Speaker 6>So this thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this tension is around you all the time </v>

2876
02:12:44.770 --> 02:12:48.100
<v Speaker 6>and it manifests itself in a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 6>different ways and one of them </v>

2877
02:12:48.100 --> 02:12:50.680
<v Speaker 6>insecurity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when you take that initial ecstasy </v>

2878
02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:51.410
<v Speaker 6>experience and it dissolves that </v>
<v Speaker 6>feeling,</v>

2879
02:12:51.411 --> 02:12:52.430
<v Speaker 6>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2880
02:12:53.130 --> 02:12:56.570
<v Speaker 6>like there's a lot of weird shit that </v>
<v Speaker 6>people trip on for no reason.</v>

2881
02:12:56.571 --> 02:13:01.571
<v Speaker 6>And me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>me weird shit that I would trip on for </v>

2882
02:13:01.571 --> 02:13:01.610
<v Speaker 6>no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That makes you wonder like,</v>

2883
02:13:01.611 --> 02:13:04.970
<v Speaker 6>how much time am I wasting with these </v>
<v Speaker 6>really poor thoughts?</v>

2884
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:07.550
<v Speaker 6>How much energy?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So much energy.</v>

2885
02:13:08.230 --> 02:13:13.230
<v Speaker 6>Like I was thinking the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is it like to work at the national </v>

2886
02:13:13.230 --> 02:13:16.550
<v Speaker 6>enquirer?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'd talk about like blowing out massive</v>

2887
02:13:16.551 --> 02:13:20.900
<v Speaker 6>amounts of energy on nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I was at the counter,</v>

2888
02:13:20.930 --> 02:13:25.930
<v Speaker 6>I was picking up some fruit and A.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went to the supermarket and I stopped </v>

2889
02:13:26.030 --> 02:13:31.030
<v Speaker 6>in the line to put my stuff on and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's this national choir thing that </v>

2890
02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:33.671
<v Speaker 6>says I sold coke to Matt Lauer and below</v>

2892
02:13:42.481 --> 02:13:44.820
<v Speaker 4>and then there was another one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was some other scandal on it too.</v>

2893
02:13:44.821 --> 02:13:46.380
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is hilarious.</v>

2894
02:13:46.381 --> 02:13:51.381
<v Speaker 4>Larry King gives a fuck if his wife is </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting laid it probably pay the cab </v>

2895
02:13:51.381 --> 02:13:51.750
<v Speaker 4>fare.</v>

2896
02:13:53.010 --> 02:13:56.720
<v Speaker 6>You Shit me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he doesn't have to disappoint her one</v>

2897

<v Speaker 6>night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2898
02:13:58.770 --> 02:14:00.740
<v Speaker 6>I deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2899
02:14:00.741 --> 02:14:02.930
<v Speaker 6>Poor Larry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw him on a show recently.</v>

2900
02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:05.690
<v Speaker 6>I think it was like Colbert.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember we were watching it.</v>

2901
02:14:05.930 --> 02:14:10.930
<v Speaker 6>Jeremy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what was that show that we were </v>

2902
02:14:10.930 --> 02:14:10.930
<v Speaker 6>watching?</v>
<v Speaker 6>His body looks very strange.</v>

2903
02:14:10.930 --> 02:14:12.530
<v Speaker 6>Very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just curling right.</v>

2904
02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:13.820
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's way worse than that.</v>

2905
02:14:13.850 --> 02:14:14.390
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2906
02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:19.790
<v Speaker 6>there's something going on where there's</v>
<v Speaker 6>no tissue in between his bones.</v>

2907
02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:24.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like when he sits there he'll like </v>

2908
02:14:24.820 --> 02:14:25.250
<v Speaker 6>sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything just sort of collapses like a</v>

2909
02:14:25.251 --> 02:14:27.770
<v Speaker 6>folding chair and assumes these weird </v>
<v Speaker 6>angles.</v>

2910
02:14:28.250 --> 02:14:30.380
<v Speaker 6>Like you sitting there and he's got like</v>
<v Speaker 6>one arm up,</v>

2911
02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:31.220
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look at that.</v>

2912
02:14:31.250 --> 02:14:33.110
<v Speaker 6>Look at that picture right there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2913
02:14:33.710 --> 02:14:35.480
<v Speaker 6>that's one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there was another one when he was on</v>

2914
02:14:35.481 --> 02:14:37.670
<v Speaker 6>the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to say he was on the couch of the</v>

2915
02:14:37.671 --> 02:14:40.160
<v Speaker 6>Colbert show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to say that's what he was doing.</v>

2916
02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:44.270
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it was just fucking strange to look.</v>

2917
02:14:44.271 --> 02:14:45.170
<v Speaker 6>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh Larry,</v>

2918

<v Speaker 6>wife cheats on them.</v>

3041
02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:34.020

3049
02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Let the guy go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a doing antidepressants.</v>

3071
02:22:05.071 --> 02:22:10.071

3100
02:23:32.220 --> 02:23:35.850

<v Speaker 6>free man of for a few years,</v>

3101

3340
02:33:55.181 --> 02:33:55.470
<v Speaker 2>beginning is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watches.</v>

3341
02:33:56.580 --> 02:34:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's insane.</v>

3342
02:34:01.591 --> 02:34:04.560
<v Speaker 2>And then she starts throwing these </v>
<v Speaker 2>tantrums and then doing it again and she</v>

3343
02:34:04.561 --> 02:34:07.170
<v Speaker 2>does it a bunch of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3344
02:34:07.220 --> 02:34:11.790
<v Speaker 2>She just keeps wailing on her own face </v>
<v Speaker 2>and screaming and yelling.</v>

3345
02:34:12.150 --> 02:34:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a woman out of control and </v>

3346
02:34:17.150 --> 02:34:18.370
<v Speaker 2>there's no one there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's doing that shit by herself.</v>

3347
02:34:18.420 --> 02:34:20.380
<v Speaker 2>So she's making noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The neighbors will hear it.</v>

3348
02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:23.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if she's doing that.</v>

3349
02:34:24.390 --> 02:34:26.730
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You open up all the windows,</v>

3350
02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:29.580
<v Speaker 2>do it so the neighbors can hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beat the shit out of yourself.</v>

3351
02:34:29.610 --> 02:34:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Your neighbors called the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You come out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he had surveillance cameras.</v>

3355
02:34:39.010 --> 02:34:41.500
<v Speaker 2>You get to see darkness sometimes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

3356
02:34:41.501 --> 02:34:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's dark.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I got.</v>

3359
02:34:46.350 --> 02:34:50.760
<v Speaker 2>I beat myself up in jail once I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got arrested for fighting and uh,</v>

3360
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:53.560
<v Speaker 2>the cops were being fucking assholes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't give me any food.</v>

3361
02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:54.850
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3362
02:34:54.910 --> 02:34:59.910
<v Speaker 2>and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he reached in and grabbed my hair </v>

3363
02:34:59.910 --> 02:35:00.910
<v Speaker 2>because I was yelling at him and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>bashed my head against the wall a couple</v>

3364
02:35:00.911 --> 02:35:05.911
<v Speaker 2>times and I wasn't bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I punched myself in the side of </v>

3365
02:35:05.911 --> 02:35:10.100
<v Speaker 2>the mouth and I made myself plead and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>got out and they just like check me out.</v>

3366
02:35:10.130 --> 02:35:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Nobody cared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like a big investigation.</v>

3367
02:35:15.130 --> 02:35:20.130
<v Speaker 2>They just felt like did on my shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 16 clever fellow Wilson.</v>

3368
02:35:23.020 --> 02:35:25.180
<v Speaker 2>It was a way to make this better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see an opening.</v>

3369
02:35:26.980 --> 02:35:28.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take the whole police force</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

3370
02:35:29.420 --> 02:35:31.930
<v Speaker 2>He grabbed my fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't prove it.</v>

3371
02:35:32.360 --> 02:35:34.060

3488
02:40:41.641 --> 02:40:46.641

3489
02:40:46.641 --> 02:40:46.641
<v Speaker 6>to be demon so they can get guys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'd be like,</v>

3497
02:41:08.690 --> 02:41:10.450
<v Speaker 6>being any way discriminatory.</v>

<v Speaker 6>syphilis got them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Huh?</v>

3555
02:43:52.270 --> 02:43:54.100
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a slow demon.</v>

3556
02:43:54.670 --> 02:43:56.020
<v Speaker 6>Is it syphilis?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

3557
02:43:56.190 --> 02:43:58.450
<v Speaker 6>but it's a demon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like it's the same thing.</v>

3558
02:43:58.540 --> 02:44:00.670
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's not going to talk to you.</v>

3559
02:44:00.671 --> 02:44:05.671
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't come from hell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it comes from here and it does the </v>

3560
02:44:05.671 --> 02:44:05.800
<v Speaker 6>same job,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just takes a different form and it's not</v>

3561
02:44:05.801 --> 02:44:10.801
<v Speaker 6>as terrifying to us for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if as many people died from demons </v>

3562
02:44:10.801 --> 02:44:13.810
<v Speaker 6>has died from the flu,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'd be shitting our pants every day,</v>

3563
02:44:14.260 --> 02:44:16.780
<v Speaker 6>like thousands of people in this country</v>
<v Speaker 6>die from the flu.</v>

3564
02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:19.070
<v Speaker 6>Nobody's out there freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

3565
02:44:19.090 --> 02:44:21.800
<v Speaker 6>imagine if you go to cvs and get an anti</v>
<v Speaker 6>demon shot.</v>

3566
02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:28.360
<v Speaker 6>The same amount of people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the same amount of people who died from </v>

3567
02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:32.281
<v Speaker 6>the flu data demons there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have like garlic rings at the </v>

3568
02:44:32.281 --> 02:44:35.941
<v Speaker 6>store.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to go and throw them on and </v>

3569
02:44:35.941 --> 02:44:35.941
<v Speaker 6>there's crosses everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3570
02:44:35.941 --> 02:44:40.420
<v Speaker 6>We would be in a state of terror if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if demons killed as many people as colds</v>

3571
02:44:40.421 --> 02:44:42.040
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3572
02:44:42.190 --> 02:44:45.940
<v Speaker 6>And it's all through sex.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like with the cold.</v>

3573
02:44:45.941 --> 02:44:48.460
<v Speaker 6>He didn't even get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just got something on a subway.</v>

3574
02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:49.390
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3575
02:44:49.391 --> 02:44:51.130
<v Speaker 6>I mean what percent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3576
02:44:51.131 --> 02:44:53.050
<v Speaker 6>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's take a guess here.</v>

3577
02:44:53.350 --> 02:44:58.350
<v Speaker 6>How many people ever like over the </v>
<v Speaker 6>course of human history have died from </v>

3578
02:44:58.350 --> 02:44:58.720
<v Speaker 6>vd?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How many?</v>

3579
02:44:58.721 --> 02:45:00.430
<v Speaker 6>Millions of people?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Millions.</v>

3580
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:02.300
<v Speaker 6>A hundred million.</v>
<v Speaker 6>$100.</v>

3581
02:45:02.301 --> 02:45:03.670
<v Speaker 6>Million.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you're probably right.</v>

3582
02:45:04.030 --> 02:45:08.920
<v Speaker 6>Let's say 100 million people have died </v>
<v Speaker 6>from venereal disease worldwide.</v>

3583
02:45:09.250 --> 02:45:13.300
<v Speaker 6>How many people think it is every year?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How many people is like hit a year?</v>

3584
02:45:13.330 --> 02:45:14.650
<v Speaker 6>Syphilis,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shit like that.</v>

3585
02:45:14.651 --> 02:45:15.100
<v Speaker 6>Kill.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3586
02:45:15.130 --> 02:45:17.200
<v Speaker 6>AIDS is still tearing up to third world.</v>

3587
02:45:19.260 --> 02:45:22.990
<v Speaker 6>A million.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A million worldwide every year.</v>

3588
02:45:23.530 --> 02:45:27.200
<v Speaker 6>That might be high.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Few hundred thousand dollars.</v>

3589
02:45:27.250 --> 02:45:30.280
<v Speaker 6>It certainly wasn't in the aids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't have no.</v>

3590
02:45:30.310 --> 02:45:31.750
<v Speaker 6>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>now that I'm saying this,</v>

3591
02:45:31.751 --> 02:45:33.400
<v Speaker 6>I'm realizing I'm totally talking out of</v>
<v Speaker 6>my ass.</v>

3592
02:45:33.401 --> 02:45:38.230
<v Speaker 6>I have no knowledge of what the actual </v>
<v Speaker 6>numbers of the aids crisis where I had a</v>

3593
02:45:38.231 --> 02:45:43.231
<v Speaker 6>guy on my podcast a long time ago who is</v>
<v Speaker 6>a biology at the University of </v>

3594
02:45:44.920 --> 02:45:49.920
<v Speaker 6>California,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Berkeley and he does not believe that </v>

3595
02:45:49.920 --> 02:45:53.221
<v Speaker 6>HIV causes aids and of all the people </v>
<v Speaker 6>that I've ever had on my podcast that </v>

3596
02:45:53.221 --> 02:45:57.370
<v Speaker 6>created more like people angry at me and</v>
<v Speaker 6>controversy.</v>

3597
02:45:57.730 --> 02:46:00.580
<v Speaker 6>I just wanted to talk to the guy because</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand the argument.</v>

3598
02:46:00.670 --> 02:46:05.670
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand how one person can </v>
<v Speaker 6>have this point of view that all these </v>

3599
02:46:05.670 --> 02:46:05.920
<v Speaker 6>other scientists and biologists don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>have.</v>

3600
02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:08.820
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck is that guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Downer?</v>

3601
02:46:09.540 --> 02:46:11.360
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the president of South Africa,</v>

3602
02:46:11.420 --> 02:46:13.730
<v Speaker 6>does this believe that HIV causes aids.</v>

3603
02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:15.140
<v Speaker 6>You has names.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Duesberg.</v>

3604
02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:18.740
<v Speaker 6>Touche Bird Duesberg.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Duesberg said German gentleman.</v>

3605
02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:24.100
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what he believed is that it was a </v>

3606
02:46:24.100 --> 02:46:26.381
<v Speaker 6>competent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said that I'm doing a shitty job </v>

3607
02:46:26.381 --> 02:46:26.840
<v Speaker 6>paraphrase,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what are you saying?</v>

3608
02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:28.960
<v Speaker 6>I know I clear my throat too much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm gonna.</v>

3609
02:46:28.970 --> 02:46:31.340
<v Speaker 6>Stop America want people that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>listening.</v>

3610
02:46:31.470 --> 02:46:33.860
<v Speaker 6>A lot of the old radio shea butter </v>
<v Speaker 6>coffee.</v>

3611
02:46:33.861 --> 02:46:35.300
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to admit it because I love </v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

3612
02:46:35.301 --> 02:46:38.540
<v Speaker 6>but I've got to stop drinking it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's just drink water for podcast.</v>

3613
02:46:38.570 --> 02:46:43.570
<v Speaker 6>It's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's annoying to me and I'm clearing my </v>

3614
02:46:43.570 --> 02:46:43.570
<v Speaker 6>own throat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anyway,</v>

3615
02:46:43.570 --> 02:46:48.250
<v Speaker 6>I think it's part of your chart.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This Duesberg Fella thought that it was </v>

3616
02:46:48.250 --> 02:46:52.331
<v Speaker 6>a good idea to tell everybody that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>HIV was actually a weak virus and that </v>

3617
02:46:53.810 --> 02:46:58.810
<v Speaker 6>it was a symptom of a deteriorated </v>
<v Speaker 6>immune system rather than the cause of </v>

3618
02:46:58.810 --> 02:46:58.810
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A deer have a,</v>

3619
02:46:58.810 --> 02:47:03.180
<v Speaker 6>created a real immune system and he </v>
<v Speaker 6>believed that the cause of the </v>

3620
02:47:03.180 --> 02:47:06.911
<v Speaker 6>deteriorated immune system was a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 6>of different recreational drugs these </v>

3621
02:47:07.821 --> 02:47:08.600
<v Speaker 6>guys would take.</v>

3622
02:47:08.750 --> 02:47:13.750
<v Speaker 6>And then there's a disproportionate </v>
<v Speaker 6>amount of these men from these areas is </v>

3623
02:47:14.091 --> 02:47:17.080
<v Speaker 6>parts of town where they were doing a </v>
<v Speaker 6>lot of drugs and how to have sex.</v>

3624
02:47:17.110 --> 02:47:22.110
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>email nitrate and crystal meth and all </v>

3625
02:47:22.110 --> 02:47:24.431
<v Speaker 6>this different stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is apparently amyl nitrate in </v>

3626
02:47:24.431 --> 02:47:27.491
<v Speaker 6>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All that stuff's apparently devastating </v>

3627
02:47:27.491 --> 02:47:29.561
<v Speaker 6>to your immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so it was his belief that the HIV </v>

3628
02:47:29.781 --> 02:47:34.781
<v Speaker 6>aspect of it was just a symptom of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>deteriorated immune system from drugs </v>

3629
02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:36.440
<v Speaker 6>and that they were saying that that </v>
<v Speaker 6>caused it.</v>

3630
02:47:36.441 --> 02:47:40.160
<v Speaker 6>But how the fuck can you sneak that by </v>
<v Speaker 6>all these different scientists?</v>

3631
02:47:40.161 --> 02:47:45.161
<v Speaker 6>It just doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I obviously don't understand the </v>

3632
02:47:45.161 --> 02:47:46.550
<v Speaker 6>argument and he is a tenured professor </v>
<v Speaker 6>at the University of California,</v>

3633
02:47:46.551 --> 02:47:49.430
<v Speaker 6>Berkeley and apparently he's made great </v>
<v Speaker 6>strides and cancer research.</v>

3634
02:47:49.431 --> 02:47:51.440
<v Speaker 6>He's actually a very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very intelligent guy.</v>

3635
02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:55.130
<v Speaker 6>But when one guy has like a theory like </v>
<v Speaker 6>this and everybody else's like,</v>

3636
02:47:55.131 --> 02:47:57.560
<v Speaker 6>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this guy to be.</v>

3637
02:47:57.740 --> 02:48:00.290
<v Speaker 6>It's just doesn't seem like it could be </v>
<v Speaker 6>possibilities.</v>

3638
02:48:00.291 --> 02:48:01.450
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does that.</v>

3639
02:48:01.460 --> 02:48:03.260
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand it,</v>

3640
02:48:03.740 --> 02:48:07.580
<v Speaker 6>but it doesn't make sense to me that one</v>
<v Speaker 6>guy has figured this out and that.</v>

3641
02:48:07.760 --> 02:48:10.310
<v Speaker 6>So when I had them on match,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people got so angry.</v>

3642
02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:11.330
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's so.</v>

3643
02:48:11.331 --> 02:48:12.740
<v Speaker 6>And it's a perfect guest.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>

3644
02:48:12.741 --> 02:48:13.880
<v Speaker 6>blood is on your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

3645
02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:18.110
<v Speaker 6>well now he's a tenured professor at an </v>
<v Speaker 6>Ivy League school.</v>

3646
02:48:18.111 --> 02:48:20.540
<v Speaker 6>I think he can bring them on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got news for you.</v>

3647
02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:22.550
<v Speaker 6>If you take it in the ass because of </v>
<v Speaker 6>this podcast,</v>

3648
02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:24.920
<v Speaker 6>you're going to take it to the ass </v>
<v Speaker 6>anyway.</v>

3649
02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:26.950
<v Speaker 6>So don't tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3650
02:48:27.690 --> 02:48:31.670
<v Speaker 6>fucking raise.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you were already had amyl nitrate in</v>

3651
02:48:31.671 --> 02:48:34.400
<v Speaker 6>your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're ready is no way.</v>

3652
02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:37.820
<v Speaker 6>I am swaying your decision to get but </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucked up condom.</v>

3653
02:48:37.970 --> 02:48:42.970
<v Speaker 6>I am not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You take responsibility for your own </v>

3654
02:48:42.970 --> 02:48:42.970
<v Speaker 6>actions.</v>

3655
02:48:42.970 --> 02:48:42.970
<v Speaker 6>You son of a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>b,</v>

3656
02:48:42.970 --> 02:48:44.390
<v Speaker 6>you standing in the gay woods.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Come on.</v>

3657
02:48:44.420 --> 02:48:48.290
<v Speaker 6>Listen to the podcast on earbuds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How ridiculous is that idea?</v>

3658
02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:49.170
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well I,</v>

3659
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:54.190
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean someone said that you should do </v>

3660
02:48:54.190 --> 02:48:57.221
<v Speaker 6>it with a qualified medical professional</v>
<v Speaker 6>so that you could have someone to </v>

3661
02:48:57.221 --> 02:49:00.221
<v Speaker 6>counteracts as claims.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is a very good point and one I </v>

3662
02:49:00.221 --> 02:49:04.151
<v Speaker 6>probably should have taken into </v>
<v Speaker 6>consideration and I probably would try </v>

3663
02:49:04.151 --> 02:49:06.821
<v Speaker 6>to do that today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but back then mean this is many years </v>

3664
02:49:06.821 --> 02:49:11.260
<v Speaker 6>ago when I was doing the podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't believe the guy even wanted </v>

3665
02:49:11.260 --> 02:49:11.260
<v Speaker 6>to talk to me and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is going to be great.</v>

3666
02:49:11.260 --> 02:49:15.710
<v Speaker 6>I always wanting to know what this </v>

<v Speaker 6>dates with other guys.</v>

3733
02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:47.640
<v Speaker 6>She's waiting for one guy to come along </v>
<v Speaker 6>that she goes on a date with earlier </v>

3734
02:52:47.640 --> 02:52:47.640
<v Speaker 6>that it's like preferred to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Like that could have just changed your </v>

3740
02:53:05.780 --> 02:53:07.771
<v Speaker 6>confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to bet it did for the </v>

<v Speaker 6>better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure it does.</v>

3742
02:53:07.771 --> 02:53:11.490
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it made me more cautious about </v>

3743
02:53:11.490 --> 02:53:11.490
<v Speaker 6>condoms.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you that,</v>

<v Speaker 6>like the,</v>

3746
02:53:14.970 --> 02:53:19.770
<v Speaker 6>the inevitable moment on stage where you</v>
<v Speaker 6>say things that people don't think it's </v>

3747
02:53:19.770 --> 02:53:19.960
<v Speaker 6>funny and you have to kind of have some </v>
<v Speaker 6>personal sovereignty.</v>

3748
02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:25.000
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a good way to develop personal </v>

3749
02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:25.000
<v Speaker 6>sovereignty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You become an outcast.</v>

3783
02:54:38.561 --> 02:54:41.170
<v Speaker 6>He was one of those few guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a few guys that got that package.</v>

3784
02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:46.200
<v Speaker 6>Remember they gave him like 500 bucks a </v>
<v Speaker 6>week and they would just work them to </v>

3785
02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:49.561
<v Speaker 6>death if you do what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But he knew that 500 bucks is coming in </v>

3786
02:54:49.561 --> 02:54:49.561
<v Speaker 6>every week and never had to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 6>work.</v>

3787
02:54:49.561 --> 02:54:52.180
<v Speaker 6>He worked and he was so loose because of</v>
<v Speaker 6>it goes.</v>

3788
02:54:52.181 --> 02:54:54.340
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was in the.</v>

3789
02:54:54.370 --> 02:54:56.560
<v Speaker 6>Allowed them to do other gigs too </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I know I did.</v>

3790
02:54:57.270 --> 02:54:58.780
<v Speaker 6>I know I did some other gigs with him </v>
<v Speaker 6>too.</v>

3791
02:54:58.781 --> 02:55:00.700
<v Speaker 6>That may not even nick's comedy stop </v>
<v Speaker 6>gigs,</v>

3792
02:55:00.850 --> 02:55:04.910
<v Speaker 6>but for the most part he worked for them</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he was such a character.</v>

3793
02:55:04.990 --> 02:55:09.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I had like a mullet and a belly and </v>

3794
02:55:09.990 --> 02:55:11.630
<v Speaker 4>he would strip down to a bikini at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>end of his act.</v>

3795
02:55:11.950 --> 02:55:14.330
<v Speaker 4>Didn't he have like a regular job too </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a long time?</v>

3796
02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:16.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like post office or something,</v>

3797
02:55:16.340 --> 02:55:17.410
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3798
02:55:21.620 --> 02:55:22.730
<v Speaker 4>that place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3799
02:55:23.270 --> 02:55:26.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to live there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I don't want to do that in the</v>

3800
02:55:26.841 --> 02:55:29.360
<v Speaker 4>winter now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God Damn was a fun place to grow up.</v>

3801
02:55:29.390 --> 02:55:30.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

3802
02:55:31.070 --> 02:55:34.760
<v Speaker 4>Because if you weren't performing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he were watching good comedy.</v>

3803
02:55:34.761 --> 02:55:37.480
<v Speaker 4>So one night that was a good night out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

3804
02:55:37.481 --> 02:55:39.470
<v Speaker 4>Like as adults,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we're looking back on it,</v>

3805
02:55:39.530 --> 02:55:44.530
<v Speaker 4>how it looks stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you literally couldn't ask for a </v>

3806
02:55:44.530 --> 02:55:47.981
<v Speaker 4>better place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We found the best place that the best </v>

3807
02:55:47.981 --> 02:55:47.981
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3808
02:55:47.981 --> 02:55:51.640
<v Speaker 4>So almost like if you are in some sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a simulated reality and you wanted </v>

3809
02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:52.450
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3810
02:55:52.820 --> 02:55:57.820
<v Speaker 4>do the dream of a struggling but </v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually becoming a professional </v>

3811
02:55:57.820 --> 02:55:59.440
<v Speaker 4>standup comic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where do you want to start?</v>

3812
02:55:59.460 --> 02:56:04.460
<v Speaker 4>I want to start out in the golden days </v>
<v Speaker 4>of comedy in the 20th century and I want</v>

3813
02:56:04.581 --> 02:56:07.790
<v Speaker 4>to make a living out of the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to drop you off in Boston.</v>

3814
02:56:07.860 --> 02:56:12.860
<v Speaker 4>He's going to be cold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The winter is going to give you </v>

3815
02:56:12.860 --> 02:56:12.860
<v Speaker 4>something to bitch about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People have short attention spans.</v>

3816
02:56:12.860 --> 02:56:16.900
<v Speaker 4>They want you to give it to them quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have very little patience for </v>

3817
02:56:16.900 --> 02:56:17.030
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't be indulgent.</v>

3818
02:56:17.300 --> 02:56:19.640
<v Speaker 4>There was no room for indulgence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3819
02:56:20.430 --> 02:56:22.460
<v Speaker 4>made you really appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Attention spans.</v>

3820
02:56:22.850 --> 02:56:24.320
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking freezing outside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

3821
02:56:24.350 --> 02:56:25.420
<v Speaker 4>Get to the point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3822
02:56:27.350 --> 02:56:29.450
<v Speaker 4>And it was like you were given the </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity,</v>

3823
02:56:29.660 --> 02:56:33.680
<v Speaker 4>but then like you could get stage time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you could get seen,</v>

3824
02:56:33.681 --> 02:56:36.770
<v Speaker 4>but to really work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had to fucking command the stage.</v>

3825
02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:40.340
<v Speaker 4>He had to do your time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had to consistently perform.</v>

3826
02:56:40.341 --> 02:56:44.210
<v Speaker 4>It was like all these things that just </v>
<v Speaker 4>made you get your 10,000</v>

3827
02:56:44.211 --> 02:56:46.580
<v Speaker 4>hours as Malcolm Gladwell says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that was,</v>

3828
02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:48.500
<v Speaker 4>that was us getting our 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

3829
02:56:48.950 --> 02:56:53.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's really like for the most part </v>

3830
02:56:53.950 --> 02:56:53.950
<v Speaker 4>it's like 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3831
02:56:53.950 --> 02:56:57.970
<v Speaker 4>Like 10 years for you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing really didn't even </v>

3832
02:56:57.970 --> 02:56:58.400
<v Speaker 4>then you're pretty shaky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think Seinfeld said 14.</v>

3833
02:56:59.360 --> 02:57:01.400
<v Speaker 4>He might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to call,</v>

3834
02:57:02.150 --> 02:57:04.580
<v Speaker 4>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just so interesting.</v>

3835
02:57:04.581 --> 02:57:05.690
<v Speaker 4>When you look back you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

3836
02:57:05.691 --> 02:57:07.550
<v Speaker 4>It all sort of played itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it.</v>

3837
02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:11.300
<v Speaker 4>Like it was a program.</v>

3838
02:57:11.301 --> 02:57:15.890
<v Speaker 4>the village in 1963,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it smells way better.</v>

3839
02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:20.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those guys never made any fucking </v>

<v Speaker 6>It wouldn't be the same kind of photo.</v>

3945
03:01:49.990 --> 03:01:51.730
<v Speaker 6>Cowboy boots are important to be down </v>

3947
03:01:56.731 --> 03:01:56.740
<v Speaker 6>afford a new car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why is he got that fucking old car?</v>

3948
03:01:56.980 --> 03:01:59.300
<v Speaker 6>Because the old cars like down home.</v>

3953
03:02:08.980 --> 03:02:11.050

<v Speaker 6>shit away from me.</v>

3954
03:02:11.051 --> 03:02:12.970

<v Speaker 6>You became Mike Sullivan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Irvin Jesus.</v>

3985
03:03:19.160 --> 03:03:21.170
<v Speaker 7>Whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 7>First Guy I ever met.</v>

3986
03:03:21.171 --> 03:03:23.540
<v Speaker 7>They call themselves a feminist too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Interesting.</v>

3987
03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:26.090
<v Speaker 7>He had women don't even call themselves </v>
<v Speaker 7>feminists anymore.</v>

3988
03:03:26.091 --> 03:03:28.920
<v Speaker 7>I was asking because I've been asking </v>
<v Speaker 7>the women in the what</v>

3989
03:03:29.960 --> 03:03:31.060
<v Speaker 6>I was online.</v>

3990
03:03:32.720 --> 03:03:34.640
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how do you.</v>

3991
03:03:34.670 --> 03:03:36.260
<v Speaker 7>How were you not a feminist if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 7>woman?</v>

3992
03:03:36.290 --> 03:03:39.650
<v Speaker 7>Isn't that just saying I want to have </v>
<v Speaker 7>equal pay for equal work?</v>

3993
03:03:41.250 --> 03:03:46.250
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you most certainly are thinking very </v>

3994
03:03:46.250 --> 03:03:46.650
<v Speaker 6>strongly in often about women's issues.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3995
03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:51.710
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which I guess you have to if you're a </v>

3996
03:03:51.710 --> 03:03:52.020
<v Speaker 6>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm realistically.</v>

3997
03:03:52.590 --> 03:03:56.520
<v Speaker 6>You should probably be thinking of like </v>
<v Speaker 6>the humanity as a whole.</v>

3998
03:03:56.550 --> 03:04:01.550
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shouldn't be really focused on one </v>

3999
03:04:01.550 --> 03:04:01.550
<v Speaker 6>gender</v>

4000
03:04:01.550 --> 03:04:01.550
<v Speaker 5>because this is just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just hear me out for a second.</v>

4001
03:04:01.550 --> 03:04:05.471
<v Speaker 5>If you're getting mad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we're all like completely </v>

4002
03:04:05.471 --> 03:04:07.490
<v Speaker 5>concentrating on one specific gender,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like female,</v>

4003
03:04:07.530 --> 03:04:10.370
<v Speaker 5>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The concerns only of the female,</v>

4004
03:04:10.810 --> 03:04:13.970
<v Speaker 5>you're automatically like breaking </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself off into a team.</v>

4005
03:04:14.090 --> 03:04:16.400
<v Speaker 5>This is like those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like men's rights guys,</v>

4006
03:04:16.880 --> 03:04:18.870
<v Speaker 5>like that's all they talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>saw the tweet about,</v>

4007
03:04:18.890 --> 03:04:20.720
<v Speaker 5>so they want to talk about is men's </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights.</v>

4008
03:04:20.721 --> 03:04:23.150
<v Speaker 5>Men's men are getting fucked over in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this country and amendment.</v>

4009
03:04:23.490 --> 03:04:27.920
<v Speaker 5>They're forming natural teams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a windows user was getting mad</v>

4010
03:04:27.921 --> 03:04:32.921
<v Speaker 5>at pc or it was getting mad at Max.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird thing that people start </v>

4011
03:04:32.921 --> 03:04:36.230
<v Speaker 5>doing when you lock people into any sort</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a one or the other,</v>

4012
03:04:36.290 --> 03:04:38.450
<v Speaker 5>like right wing versus left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4013
03:04:38.460 --> 03:04:39.000
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4014
03:04:39.080 --> 03:04:41.450
<v Speaker 5>people who are straight edge versus </v>
<v Speaker 5>people like to party.</v>

4015
03:04:41.570 --> 03:04:46.570
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get these locked in ideologies and </v>

4016
03:04:46.570 --> 03:04:46.570
<v Speaker 5>that's a big one.</v>

4017
03:04:46.570 --> 03:04:46.570
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a big one.</v>

4018
03:04:46.570 --> 03:04:51.251
<v Speaker 5>The gender ones a big one because pc's </v>
<v Speaker 5>are not making less money than Max.</v>

4019
03:04:52.640 --> 03:04:57.640
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing about that whole </v>

4020
03:04:57.640 --> 03:04:57.640
<v Speaker 5>narrative about women making less money </v>
<v Speaker 5>than men.</v>

4021
03:04:57.640 --> 03:04:58.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you've ever investigated</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

4022
03:04:58.971 --> 03:05:03.971
<v Speaker 5>but I had a long conversation with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>good friend of mine about it recently </v>

4023
03:05:03.971 --> 03:05:04.790
<v Speaker 5>where he was saying it wrong too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the reality.</v>

4024
03:05:04.970 --> 03:05:07.490
<v Speaker 5>The reality is when they do these </v>
<v Speaker 5>gender,</v>

4025
03:05:08.540 --> 03:05:13.480
<v Speaker 5>gender income disparity studies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

4026
03:05:13.490 --> 03:05:18.490
<v Speaker 5>It's not like they're giving you the </v>
<v Speaker 5>impression that a man and a woman to </v>

4027
03:05:18.490 --> 03:05:21.581
<v Speaker 5>work next to each other and they doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same job at the woman's making </v>

4028
03:05:21.581 --> 03:05:22.610
<v Speaker 5>seventy seven cents to the man's dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not what the study showed.</v>

4029
03:05:22.850 --> 03:05:27.850
<v Speaker 5>What the study showed is that overall </v>
<v Speaker 5>the men earned more money than the women</v>

4030
03:05:28.221 --> 03:05:33.221
<v Speaker 5>did if they were both working and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't mean that they were doing the </v>

4031
03:05:33.221 --> 03:05:33.221
<v Speaker 5>same job.</v>

4032
03:05:33.221 --> 03:05:33.530
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it means the opposite.</v>

4033
03:05:33.531 --> 03:05:35.660
<v Speaker 5>Men were choosing jobs that are much </v>
<v Speaker 5>more high risk.</v>

4034
03:05:36.020 --> 03:05:41.020
<v Speaker 5>They were working longer hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you're comparing women who worked on </v>

4035
03:05:41.020 --> 03:05:43.760
<v Speaker 5>an average of 35 hours to men who worked</v>
<v Speaker 5>40 hours plus and doing different jobs,</v>

4036
03:05:43.880 --> 03:05:44.870
<v Speaker 5>so it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

4037
03:05:44.900 --> 03:05:49.900
<v Speaker 5>but this is the study.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The study's not that to people like </v>

4038
03:05:49.900 --> 03:05:52.901
<v Speaker 5>your.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm an accountant and she's an </v>

4039
03:05:52.901 --> 03:05:52.901
<v Speaker 5>accountant and you both do the exact </v>
<v Speaker 5>same job,</v>

4040
03:05:52.901 --> 03:05:57.110
<v Speaker 5>the exact same workload,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you make $100 where she makes $77.</v>

4041
03:05:57.140 --> 03:05:59.270
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's how everybody wants study.</v>

4042
03:05:59.271 --> 03:06:04.271
<v Speaker 5>There's other studies that show like </v>
<v Speaker 5>categorically Walmart was paying the </v>

4043
03:06:04.271 --> 03:06:05.240
<v Speaker 5>same job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were paying women less.</v>

4044
03:06:05.270 --> 03:06:10.270
<v Speaker 5>That's entirely possible and given </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual companies that could be </v>

4045
03:06:10.270 --> 03:06:13.220
<v Speaker 5>sexist for sure 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's not like what gets spit out.</v>

4046
03:06:13.610 --> 03:06:18.610
<v Speaker 5>Everybody spits out that women make </v>
<v Speaker 5>seventy seven cents to every man's </v>

4047
03:06:18.610 --> 03:06:18.610
<v Speaker 5>dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just not true.</v>

4048
03:06:18.610 --> 03:06:20.630
<v Speaker 5>It's not like they're doing the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>jobs.</v>

4049
03:06:20.660 --> 03:06:23.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean you could argue that there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the.</v>

4050
03:06:23.301 --> 03:06:28.301
<v Speaker 5>One of the best arguments about it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they were saying that women being </v>

4051
03:06:28.301 --> 03:06:32.561
<v Speaker 5>less confident or less likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>assertive early on and negotiate a good </v>

4052
03:06:32.991 --> 03:06:35.360
<v Speaker 5>salary for themselves and that could be </v>
<v Speaker 5>an issue,</v>

4053
03:06:35.540 --> 03:06:40.540
<v Speaker 5>but over time that sort of balanced </v>
<v Speaker 5>itself out with performance and that </v>

4054
03:06:40.540 --> 03:06:44.211
<v Speaker 5>there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was the hypothesis that was thrown </v>

4055
03:06:44.211 --> 03:06:45.230
<v Speaker 5>around by one one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a one article,</v>

4056
03:06:45.260 --> 03:06:48.350
<v Speaker 5>but the overall numbers are not what </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody says.</v>

4057
03:06:48.590 --> 03:06:51.500
<v Speaker 5>Everybody loves to say those numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They love to heart those numbers back at</v>

4058
03:06:51.501 --> 03:06:52.490
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would say,</v>

4059
03:06:52.491 --> 03:06:57.491
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women make seventy seven cents to every </v>

4060
03:06:57.491 --> 03:06:57.491
<v Speaker 5>man's dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a sexist world,</v>

4061
03:06:57.491 --> 03:06:57.780
<v Speaker 5>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not what's going on.</v>

4062
03:06:57.810 --> 03:07:02.610
<v Speaker 5>It might be still a section on maternity</v>
<v Speaker 5>leave and there's things that are just,</v>

4063
03:07:02.670 --> 03:07:07.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to hold a woman back from making </v>

4064
03:07:07.670 --> 03:07:09.891
<v Speaker 5>more money because yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she should lose her place in line </v>

4065
03:07:09.891 --> 03:07:11.010
<v Speaker 5>basically by taking materially I get </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

4066
03:07:11.430 --> 03:07:16.430
<v Speaker 5>but there has been plenty of studies of </v>
<v Speaker 5>ceos that are making the disparity in </v>

4067
03:07:17.071 --> 03:07:21.030
<v Speaker 5>what ceos of major companies when they </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at the same size,</v>

4068
03:07:21.031 --> 03:07:26.031
<v Speaker 5>companies making the same profits every </v>
<v Speaker 5>year and then you've got the woman </v>

4069
03:07:26.031 --> 03:07:26.031
<v Speaker 5>making,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4070
03:07:26.031 --> 03:07:27.490
<v Speaker 5>consistently seventy cents on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dollar.</v>

4071
03:07:27.490 --> 03:07:29.700
<v Speaker 5>He's generous for some of those jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know about that study.</v>

4072
03:07:29.701 --> 03:07:31.440
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but again,</v>

4073
03:07:31.800 --> 03:07:36.800
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about ceos and this is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>very rare segment of the population I </v>

4074
03:07:36.800 --> 03:07:37.720
<v Speaker 5>don't think needs any sympathy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4075
03:07:37.800 --> 03:07:42.800
<v Speaker 5>Like any woman who is the CEO is </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably making some fucking ridiculous </v>

4076
03:07:42.800 --> 03:07:46.011
<v Speaker 5>amount of money in the first place and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's always overexaggerated how much </v>

4077
03:07:46.011 --> 03:07:49.251
<v Speaker 5>money they make but wouldn't accompany.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Be Ridiculous if they paid a woman less </v>

4078
03:07:50.371 --> 03:07:54.660
<v Speaker 5>money and she's making them more money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like wouldn't she leave and go somewhere</v>

4079
03:07:54.661 --> 03:07:57.060
<v Speaker 5>where she would make more money?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if she's that good,</v>

4080
03:07:57.061 --> 03:07:59.730
<v Speaker 5>if she's competing with men and going </v>
<v Speaker 5>right up against them,</v>

4081
03:07:59.880 --> 03:08:00.960
<v Speaker 5>this is the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4082
03:08:01.760 --> 03:08:03.780
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have the answer because I'm,</v>

4083
03:08:03.781 --> 03:08:08.781
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm obviously just reading these </v>

4084
03:08:08.781 --> 03:08:08.781
<v Speaker 5>statistics and reading one of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people said,</v>

4085
03:08:08.781 --> 03:08:10.800
<v Speaker 5>but I would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine there's some deep seated</v>

4086
03:08:10.801 --> 03:08:15.300
<v Speaker 5>sexism that is almost impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 5>overcome mental want women as bosses for</v>

4087
03:08:15.301 --> 03:08:17.190
<v Speaker 5>the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like subconscious.</v>

4088
03:08:17.880 --> 03:08:22.880
<v Speaker 5>But whether or not that's responsible </v>
<v Speaker 5>for women making less money in the same </v>

4089
03:08:23.071 --> 03:08:25.770
<v Speaker 5>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently not according to the numbers,</v>

4090
03:08:26.070 --> 03:08:29.340
<v Speaker 5>according to the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of it is the choosing of different</v>

4091
03:08:29.341 --> 03:08:34.341
<v Speaker 5>paths in life as far as careers that </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that's why this push to get women </v>

4092
03:08:34.341 --> 03:08:38.211
<v Speaker 5>into stem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why this push to get women into </v>

4093
03:08:38.211 --> 03:08:38.211
<v Speaker 5>technology like tech,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like silicone valley,</v>

4094
03:08:38.211 --> 03:08:39.780
<v Speaker 5>there's this big disparity between men </v>
<v Speaker 5>and women.</v>

4095
03:08:40.170 --> 03:08:45.170
<v Speaker 5>But that display was parodies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like real similar to how it is in a lot </v>

4096
03:08:45.170 --> 03:08:48.261
<v Speaker 5>of tech.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like most women don't gravitate </v>

4097
03:08:48.261 --> 03:08:48.690
<v Speaker 5>towards those jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if they do,</v>

4098
03:08:48.900 --> 03:08:53.900
<v Speaker 5>they find them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's not that many women as opposed </v>

4099
03:08:53.900 --> 03:08:53.900
<v Speaker 5>to men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's much,</v>

4100
03:08:53.900 --> 03:08:55.020
<v Speaker 5>much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think tech like look this up.</v>

4101
03:08:55.021 --> 03:08:57.750
<v Speaker 5>Like what is Silicone Valley?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are the just crazy.</v>

4102
03:08:57.751 --> 03:08:58.880
<v Speaker 5>It's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

4103
03:08:59.070 --> 03:09:01.080
<v Speaker 5>is it a problem though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this is the question,</v>

4104
03:09:01.081 --> 03:09:04.470
<v Speaker 5>like that's something that people always</v>
<v Speaker 5>pair it and repeat that it's a problem.</v>

4105
03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:09.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's a problem or if </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's held women naturally navigate </v>

4106
03:09:10.021 --> 03:09:12.070
<v Speaker 5>towards different careers than men do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

4107
03:09:12.120 --> 03:09:14.220
<v Speaker 5>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>none of this stuff is black and white.</v>

4108
03:09:14.221 --> 03:09:19.221
<v Speaker 5>I think that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think part of it is also when women </v>

4109
03:09:19.221 --> 03:09:19.221
<v Speaker 5>have role models,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they think,</v>

4110
03:09:19.221 --> 03:09:20.340
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I want to be like,</v>

4111
03:09:20.730 --> 03:09:25.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think now that you've got some big </v>

4112
03:09:25.730 --> 03:09:25.730
<v Speaker 5>corporate ceos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4113
03:09:25.730 --> 03:09:26.780
<v Speaker 5>the woman that wrote that book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lean in and uh,</v>

4114
03:09:27.740 --> 03:09:28.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

4115
03:09:28.870 --> 03:09:30.250
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it,</v>

4116
03:09:30.280 --> 03:09:32.370
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it allows women to visualize,</v>

4117
03:09:32.400 --> 03:09:37.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's why I think it's important </v>

4118
03:09:37.400 --> 03:09:37.400
<v Speaker 5>that Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when she was president,</v>

4119
03:09:37.400 --> 03:09:38.730
<v Speaker 5>as much as I'm not a fan of hers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it will accomplish setting a new</v>

4120
03:09:38.970 --> 03:09:40.770
<v Speaker 5>goal for women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll do this one though,</v>

4121
03:09:41.010 --> 03:09:44.490
<v Speaker 5>and silicone valley men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>69 percent more likely to receive higher</v>

4122
03:09:44.491 --> 03:09:47.250
<v Speaker 5>salary offer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for their initial first salary,</v>

03:09:48.300 --> 03:09:51.300
<v Speaker 5>69 percent more likely,</v>

4124
03:09:51.330 --> 03:09:56.330
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess there's gotTa be discrimination </v>

4125
03:09:56.330 --> 03:09:59.041
<v Speaker 5>when you think about a woman that wants </v>
<v Speaker 5>to get pregnant and have a family and </v>

4126
03:09:59.041 --> 03:10:01.591
<v Speaker 5>she's going to take time off work and if</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have to give her </v>

4127
03:10:01.591 --> 03:10:03.661
<v Speaker 5>maternity leave,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's gonna be unproductive money that </v>

4128
03:10:03.661 --> 03:10:03.661
<v Speaker 5>your company has to give out.</v>

4129
03:10:03.661 --> 03:10:04.170
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

<v Speaker 6>So she sued someone.</v>

4136
03:10:18.631 --> 03:10:22.380
<v Speaker 6>I think it was Google for a gender </v>
<v Speaker 6>discrimination and lost.</v>

4137
03:10:23.160 --> 03:10:25.020
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't the reddit.</v>

4140
03:10:30.360 --> 03:10:33.930

<v Speaker 6>a frivolous lawsuit.</v>

03:10:33.980 --> 03:10:36.180
<v Speaker 6>Uh Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

4142
03:10:36.181 --> 03:10:38.100

03:10:38.610 --> 03:10:39.330
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Work with a bunch of dudes.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Whether it's sexist or not,</v>

4146
03:10:44.310 --> 03:10:49.310
<v Speaker 6>I would not want to be a woman in an </v>
<v Speaker 6>office with nine other dudes that are </v>

4147
03:10:49.310 --> 03:10:53.510

<v Speaker 6>climb the corporate ladder and I got to </v>

4148
03:10:53.510 --> 03:10:58.131
<v Speaker 6>compete with these ass Fox and they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>all out playing golf and talking shit </v>

03:11:17.211 --> 03:11:20.721
<v Speaker 7>of a sudden everybody just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>mellows out a little bit and I think </v>

4157
03:11:20.721 --> 03:11:21.890
<v Speaker 7>it's more productive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What can you equal opportunity maps?</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>difference between men and women.</v>

4163
03:11:38.610 --> 03:11:42.990
<v Speaker 5>Just there's so much variety and there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>so many people that are women that would</v>

4164
03:11:42.991 --> 03:11:47.991
<v Speaker 5>thrive in a high pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>high stress situations alongside men and</v>

4165
03:11:48.331 --> 03:11:50.670
<v Speaker 5>so many women that just won't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>

<v Speaker 5>in there that hate their fucking life,</v>

4168
03:11:55.240 --> 03:12:00.240

<v Speaker 5>do what you do would be in hell every </v>

4172
03:12:04.561 --> 03:12:09.561
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can't string the words together </v>
