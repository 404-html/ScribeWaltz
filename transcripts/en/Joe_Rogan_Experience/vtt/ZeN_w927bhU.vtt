00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.611
<v Speaker 2>He's this tiny,</v>

152
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:43.201
<v Speaker 2>frail kind of,</v>

153
00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:43.631
<v Speaker 2>not frail,</v>

154
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 2>but he's whips and bike around,</v>

155
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 2>but he's just smaller and he's like,</v>

156
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.624
<v Speaker 2>how do you do that?</v>

157
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

158
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.123
<v Speaker 2>hurt somebody.</v>

159
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna fucking hurt yourself man.</v>

160
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:49.991
<v Speaker 2>You've got kids.</v>

161
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:50.824
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like a year.</v>

162
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 2>I saw you this morning.</v>

163
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 2>50 feet above the ground.</v>

164
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Upside down with the fucking motorcycle it though.</v>

165
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you talking about.</v>

166
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Those dudes are nuts.</v>

167
00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean everybody's got their own idea of like,</v>

168
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:00.641
<v Speaker 2>what's scary though?</v>

169
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 2>It's weird for some people,</v>

170
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 2>the scariest thing in the world is public speaking.</v>

171
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

172
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 2>true in this doing this would be terrifying,</v>

173
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 2>but to us this is,</v>

174
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 2>was this like a hangout?</v>

175
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.353
<v Speaker 2>Love it.</v>

176
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 2>We have to remind ourselves,</v>

177
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 2>what do we have your headphones on and that we're on?</v>

178
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

179
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.753
<v Speaker 2>see often,</v>

180
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 2>but like to me,</v>

181
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 2>the idea of jumping,</v>

182
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 2>flipping through the air and a motorcycle.</v>

183
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Fuck all that.</v>

184
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Skydiving is fun though.</v>

185
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Don't fucking fuck.</v>

186
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

187
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.373
<v Speaker 2>I would never date.</v>

188
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 2>I did a lot of stupid sports.</v>

189
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I put myself in the hospital snowboarding.</v>

190
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Like I was tiny.</v>

191
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 2>But I've been good at just about everything I've done.</v>

192
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.713
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's not the problem.</v>

204
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 2>The problem is just,</v>

205
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people on the fucking mountain.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're coming down to an hour.</v>

207

<v Speaker 2>Where'd you get all these people?</v>

208

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Don't get hurt.</v>

221
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.311

<v Speaker 2>There's people way better than you and the people that suck more worse than you.</v>

229
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.220

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.120
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:48.923
<v Speaker 5>Maybe</v>

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.180
<v Speaker 5>he showed some series k one or k three striking</v>

475
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.420
<v Speaker 1>stay for maybe a k five k you're saying is working.</v>

476
00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 1>His was all right.</v>

477
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.170
<v Speaker 1>I thought Ken was like really hesitant.</v>

478
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Stand on the outside.</v>

479
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I thought Kevin Hall light him up.</v>

480
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.820
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying Ken compared to voices,</v>

481
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.110
<v Speaker 1>what were horse wasn't doing much.</v>

482
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.700
<v Speaker 1>There's no threat to his striking.</v>

483
00:12:09.701 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 1>So I was like super surprised that Ken wasn't lighten them up because if you go</v>

484
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 1>back to like Ken that fought Fujita,</v>

485
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Ken had some fucking legit leg go.</v>

486
00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.123
<v Speaker 1>Good power.</v>

487
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

488
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.730
<v Speaker 1>He 25 years ago,</v>

489
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.260
<v Speaker 1>he's not cripple.</v>

490
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:24.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean w were,</v>

491
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 1>where did the body go?</v>

492
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:26.830
<v Speaker 1>He's got to have that power.</v>

493
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.990
<v Speaker 1>He's got to have that ability at the same joints.</v>

494
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:30.190
<v Speaker 1>My man maybe,</v>

495
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know what's going on with his body,</v>

496
00:12:31.931 --> 00:12:35.050
<v Speaker 1>but I would've thought Ken would have fucked his legs up if I was in Cannes</v>

497
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:35.351
<v Speaker 1>corner.</v>

498
00:12:35.351 --> 00:12:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I would say you're going to kick the shit out of this.</v>

499
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Greg's,</v>

500
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Speaker 1>you're going to,</v>

501
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:38.801
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>

502
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:40.210
<v Speaker 1>he's no threat with punches.</v>

503
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he's going to drop you with one straight right hand.</v>

504
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

505
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:47.110
<v Speaker 1>So what you do is you like Paul with the hands and you come in and you throw a</v>

506
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:48.430
<v Speaker 1>bomb leg kicks,</v>

507
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Dang gates and gay fever.</v>

508
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.093
<v Speaker 1>That's no joke.</v>

509
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:51.731
<v Speaker 1>Not Fun.</v>

510
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:52.900
<v Speaker 1>That kills motherfuckers.</v>

511
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

512
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I really thought I would have thought Ken would have just let those legs on</v>

513
00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:57.670
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

514
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.150
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time he had voices,</v>

515
00:12:59.270 --> 00:12:59.620
<v Speaker 1>voices,</v>

516
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.580
<v Speaker 1>chance was on the ground.</v>

517
00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:01.560
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to get taken care of.</v>

518
00:13:01.561 --> 00:13:02.394
<v Speaker 1>It didn't get were too,</v>

519
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:02.610

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:03.341
<v Speaker 1>You got that too.</v>

521
00:13:03.341 --> 00:13:04.174
<v Speaker 1>He might've got everything.</v>

522
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Justin Brown,</v>

<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

527
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.410

532
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:21.700
<v Speaker 1>If he knows how to do that.</v>

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was fighting,</v>

630
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.950
<v Speaker 1>but that's the thing about can crushers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You look awesome.</v>

632
00:15:38.691 --> 00:15:39.261
<v Speaker 1>If you're fighting,</v>

633
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:40.180
<v Speaker 1>nobody would,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

635

636
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Then he said he come from fighting on the back streets of Miami.</v>

637
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

640
00:15:47.281 --> 00:15:48.710
<v Speaker 1>and I think his last opponent,</v>

641
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:52.310
<v Speaker 1>whoever was talking about it on the pod on the broadcast,</v>

642
00:15:52.311 --> 00:15:54.950
<v Speaker 1>was talking about the record of his last opponent.</v>

643
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:55.611
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

644
00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:56.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

645
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.561
<v Speaker 1>Oh and sick.</v>

646
00:15:56.561 --> 00:15:57.680
<v Speaker 1>I was like a midget fight.</v>

647
00:15:57.681 --> 00:15:58.161
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

648
00:15:58.161 --> 00:15:58.994
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

649
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.260
<v Speaker 1>you know what that showed that showed maybe,</v>

650
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:07.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe Bella torque just was a little too eager to try to do things that the UFC</v>

651
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:10.550
<v Speaker 1>wasn't willing to do.</v>

652
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:10.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

653
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:10.940
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

654
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's the pride thing.</v>

655
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:14.141
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

656
00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:14.850
<v Speaker 1>And you come out,</v>

657
00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:15.170
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

658
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.270
<v Speaker 1>you have Tyson commentating and he's drunk.</v>

659
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:18.463
<v Speaker 1>All the stuff,</v>

660
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.250
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff the UFC wouldn't do belters like we're going to do it.</v>

661
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:22.920
<v Speaker 1>You do that.</v>

662
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.960
<v Speaker 1>You think Tyson was drunk?</v>

663
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.280
<v Speaker 1>He was on something.</v>

664
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.560
<v Speaker 1>He was on some pills and he was on some shit.</v>

665
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.200
<v Speaker 1>I think he might've been on a whole career of getting punched in the head.</v>

666
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.131
<v Speaker 1>You think up to,</v>

667
00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:32.390
<v Speaker 1>hopefully when I have brain trauma,</v>

668
00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:33.290
<v Speaker 1>like that catches up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was funny.</v>

672
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson commentating is hilarious.</v>

673
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:38.930
<v Speaker 1>It was funny.</v>

674
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:39.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

675
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:42.410
<v Speaker 1>totally for that.</v>

676
00:16:42.411 --> 00:16:43.880
<v Speaker 1>When Melvin Gallard got knocked out,</v>

677
00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:44.151
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

678
00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:47.930
<v Speaker 1>which radiated ego is ruthless,</v>

679
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.720
<v Speaker 1>ruthless mock Hindus getting teed off on.</v>

680
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:51.651
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

681
00:16:51.651 --> 00:16:52.880
<v Speaker 1>look where you're going to be eventually.</v>

682
00:16:52.881 --> 00:16:53.714
<v Speaker 1>Look at me,</v>

683
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Justin.</v>

684
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.990
<v Speaker 1>The grand scheme of things like Bella tore it.</v>

685
00:16:56.991 --> 00:16:58.160
<v Speaker 1>They signed Ben Henderson,</v>

686
00:16:58.161 --> 00:16:59.540
<v Speaker 1>who's a fucking monster that's,</v>

687
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.060
<v Speaker 1>can you want to get all these other guys come over?</v>

688
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:02.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

689
00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:02.781
<v Speaker 1>I'm Phil Davis,</v>

690
00:17:02.781 --> 00:17:03.920
<v Speaker 1>so they're making momentum.</v>

691
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Then you put that product out.</v>

692
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.230
<v Speaker 1>If I'm a free agent,</v>

693
00:17:06.231 --> 00:17:06.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

694
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.161

00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:08.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to play him.</v>

696
00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:11.060
<v Speaker 1>I think they eventually got to let all that stuff go.</v>

697
00:17:11.061 --> 00:17:12.200
<v Speaker 1>They can't keep doing those.</v>

698
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:13.203
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't stop.</v>

699
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.240
<v Speaker 1>This is the last one.</v>

700
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.580
<v Speaker 1>It stopped the sale chat because if they keep doing it,</v>

701
00:17:16.581 --> 00:17:17.900
<v Speaker 1>they're going to really lose credibility.</v>

702
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:19.790
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things they need to do.</v>

703
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:20.451
<v Speaker 1>That name,</v>

704
00:17:20.451 --> 00:17:22.750
<v Speaker 1>they're sticking with that stupid fucking name and they're calling it Bella</v>

<v Speaker 1>Who's this?</v>

711
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Nobody understands it.</v>

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:29.841

715
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.570
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely only going to get people that are fans of tour already.</v>

716
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.340
<v Speaker 1>They're going to take it seriously and look for it.</v>

717
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Like people that are flipping through the channels when they see Bella tour</v>

<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

720
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:42.891
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

721
00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:43.724
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean anything.</v>

722
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.980
<v Speaker 1>But if you have MMA like old crowd Skout it again.</v>

735
00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Now if they just turned it into MMA,</v>

736
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.980
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows what MMA is,</v>

737
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.550
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

738
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

739
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.810
<v Speaker 1>but it's valid towards a dumb name.</v>

740
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:14.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like matters.</v>

741
00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.360
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>

742
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Pride.</v>

743
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

744
00:18:16.171 --> 00:18:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Rise and didn't mean shit.</v>

745
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Use tools.</v>

746
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.960
<v Speaker 1>Rising tide doing Eddie how's rising?</v>

747
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Implied because of their name.</v>

748
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:23.020
<v Speaker 1>They failed.</v>

749
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with these details by man</v>

750
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:28.243
<v Speaker 1>damn name.</v>

751
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was cause of the Yakuza.</v>

752
00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:34.020
<v Speaker 1>But do you pay attention to sneaky shit that the fucking athletic commission</v>

753
00:18:34.021 --> 00:18:34.590
<v Speaker 1>did?</v>

754
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Manderlay sneaky ass shit they gave,</v>

755
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:40.530
<v Speaker 1>they randomly signs of fight with fade or the UFC let some go.</v>

756
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

757
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.870
<v Speaker 1>so Vandelay finally can make some money.</v>

758
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:44.400
<v Speaker 1>The dude hasn't been able to make any money.</v>

759
00:18:44.401 --> 00:18:45.540
<v Speaker 1>So I was in over a year,</v>

760
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like 17 months.</v>

761
00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:48.180
<v Speaker 1>He hadn't been able to make a dime.</v>

762
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

763
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.700
<v Speaker 1>So He's struggling and um,</v>

764
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:50.980
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

765
00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:51.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

766
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.370
<v Speaker 1>the athletic commission totally did them dirty.</v>

767
00:18:53.371 --> 00:18:55.080
<v Speaker 1>They suspend him for his entire career.</v>

768
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.330
<v Speaker 1>The judge overrules it says that,</v>

769
00:18:57.331 --> 00:18:58.350
<v Speaker 1>that you can't do that.</v>

770
00:18:58.351 --> 00:19:00.150
<v Speaker 1>You can't just suspend the guy forever.</v>

771
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

772
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.940
<v Speaker 1>You can't just deny him a right to make a living.</v>

773
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:07.740
<v Speaker 1>So Vandelay gets released when the EOC signs to fight,</v>

774
00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:08.970
<v Speaker 1>fade or in rising.</v>

775
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a big payday for watch that finally he's going to get some money.</v>

776
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.560
<v Speaker 1>You know what the Athletic Commission does,</v>

777
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.570
<v Speaker 1>they fucking suspend them for three years.</v>

778
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.381
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

779
00:19:16.381 --> 00:19:16.770
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

780
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.370
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

781
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:17.821
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

782
00:19:17.821 --> 00:19:18.151
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

783
00:19:18.151 --> 00:19:22.830
<v Speaker 1>we are going to change your suspension from a lifetime band three years.</v>

784
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.060
<v Speaker 1>So it's retroactive.</v>

785
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.160
<v Speaker 1>So he still has a year and a half to go.</v>

786
00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:27.200
<v Speaker 1>So he can't take this flight,</v>

787
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.770
<v Speaker 1>but rising thing where Japan,</v>

788
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.830
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter why it goes over there and takes that fight.</v>

789
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.540
<v Speaker 1>They'll view it as a violation.</v>

790
00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:34.960
<v Speaker 1>He won't be able to fight in the United States.</v>

791
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.813
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it,</v>

792
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:36.653
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't stay.</v>

793
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.510
<v Speaker 1>He'll never be able to fight in the United States.</v>

794
00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:40.910
<v Speaker 1>So he stockholders and fuck.</v>

795
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:41.803
<v Speaker 1>But he just said,</v>

796
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.090
<v Speaker 1>here's why you shouldn't Beltour tour.</v>

797
00:19:45.091 --> 00:19:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Probably pay him some serious fucking money.</v>

798
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Serious fuck will be in a year and a half.</v>

799
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:50.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

800
00:19:50.101 --> 00:19:52.940
<v Speaker 1>but he's not yelling at national then,</v>

801
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:53.850
<v Speaker 1>but what's going on?</v>

802
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:54.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

803
00:19:54.121 --> 00:19:57.840
<v Speaker 1>but rising ain't going to be around sun rise and doesn't have much time.</v>

804
00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.591
<v Speaker 1>And what is he going to do?</v>

805
00:19:58.591 --> 00:19:59.970
<v Speaker 1>He's going to fight for one FC.</v>

806
00:19:59.971 --> 00:20:01.080
<v Speaker 1>No one watches that.</v>

807
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.510
<v Speaker 1>You Know Ben aspirins been whooping Chinese.</v>

808
00:20:03.511 --> 00:20:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Dude's ass was over there for a year and a half and one see shit and can't get a</v>

809
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.680
<v Speaker 1>fucking right up on it.</v>

810
00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.470
<v Speaker 1>When he talks about it is amazing.</v>

811
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Ragdoll and beating the fuck out of dudes.</v>

812
00:20:12.841 --> 00:20:13.530
<v Speaker 1>And I liked the,</v>

813
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.360
<v Speaker 1>they allow him to use his knees on the ground,</v>

814
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.420
<v Speaker 1>knees on the ground rising.</v>

815
00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.880
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting rising to his last fight was rising,</v>

816
00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.050
<v Speaker 1>but for that was what?</v>

817
00:20:22.051 --> 00:20:22.884
<v Speaker 1>FC Right.</v>

818
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Aoki.</v>

819
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.140
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting chrome fund one FC too.</v>

820
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it's first fight was one of safe.</v>

821
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I was in Asia.</v>

822
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

823
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it first fight was his last fight was rising but if I'm,</v>

824
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm a wanderly 100 bro.</v>

825
00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:37.770
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to wait around?</v>

826
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:38.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

827
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.130
<v Speaker 1>The fight in the states thing gets dirty with the athletic commission did that</v>

828
00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:41.400
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

829
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.270
<v Speaker 1>they fucked up.</v>

830
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Suspended him right before,</v>

831
00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.230
<v Speaker 1>right after he takes his fight.</v>

832
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 1>So by violating it,</v>

833
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.750
<v Speaker 1>essentially they're playing little games cause by him violating that they,</v>

834
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:53.840
<v Speaker 1>they're really like,</v>

835
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:54.703
<v Speaker 1>they get what they want.</v>

836
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.590
<v Speaker 1>They get what they want.</v>

837
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.520
<v Speaker 1>The waterlase Baker over there?</v>

838
00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:57.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

839
00:20:57.851 --> 00:20:59.710
<v Speaker 1>But he all they had to do like how,</v>

840
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.570
<v Speaker 1>how many months away is that fight?</v>

841
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Like it's in August,</v>

842
00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:03.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

843
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

844
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.040
<v Speaker 1>So march,</v>

845
00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:06.371
<v Speaker 1>April,</v>

846
00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:07.570
<v Speaker 1>May,</v>

847
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:07.570
<v Speaker 1>June,</v>

848
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:07.570
<v Speaker 1>July,</v>

849
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:07.720
<v Speaker 1>August.</v>

850
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.160
<v Speaker 1>If they just gave him two years,</v>

851
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.150
<v Speaker 1>they gave him two years,</v>

852
00:21:10.151 --> 00:21:10.984
<v Speaker 1>he would have been out.</v>

853
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.240
<v Speaker 1>He would have been done at the end of July.</v>

854
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.270
<v Speaker 1>He would have been able to fight and they given an extra year so he's fucked.</v>

855
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:17.440
<v Speaker 1>You know what man?</v>

856
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Two years is what you're supposed to get because that's what you would've got if</v>

857
00:21:20.261 --> 00:21:21.250
<v Speaker 1>he tested positive.</v>

858
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:21.491
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

859
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:23.080
<v Speaker 1>That's what any relation did.</v>

860
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:23.920
<v Speaker 1>He ran,</v>

861
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.150
<v Speaker 1>let's pretend he was positive.</v>

862
00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Pretend he was positive.</v>

863
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:27.311
<v Speaker 1>Then he's two years.</v>

864
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:28.090
<v Speaker 1>He's the spine them.</v>

865
00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.510
<v Speaker 1>You find them for whatever and you let the guy have a God damn fucking career.</v>

866
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:32.081
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

867
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:36.460
<v Speaker 1>this is a game that I think it's a game of three years.</v>

868
00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Pr.</v>

869
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.013
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

870
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.450
<v Speaker 1>why is it three years when he didn't test positive?</v>

871
00:21:40.451 --> 00:21:41.171
<v Speaker 1>If it's two years,</v>

872
00:21:41.171 --> 00:21:42.130
<v Speaker 1>if he did test positive,</v>

873
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.210
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

874
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.680
<v Speaker 1>No two years is the right amount.</v>

875
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.270
<v Speaker 1>If a guy runs from a test,</v>

876
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.410
<v Speaker 1>assume he's positive,</v>

877
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.060
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely shooting around.</v>

878
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.590
<v Speaker 1>He definitely should be panelized.</v>

879
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Every fighter who runs from a test should be penalized as if they tested</v>

880
00:21:54.191 --> 00:21:54.760
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>

881
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.750
<v Speaker 1>So if that's the case,</v>

882
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.651
<v Speaker 1>why three years,</v>

883
00:21:56.651 --> 00:21:59.350
<v Speaker 1>why not to did over him from a test?</v>

884
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:00.303
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

885
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.353
<v Speaker 1>he does know.</v>

886
00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.490
<v Speaker 1>He tested positive horsemeat horseman and all.</v>

887
00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:09.491
<v Speaker 1>I did a German voice but some mustache to back the Belko.</v>

888
00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:11.290
<v Speaker 1>How about your boy?</v>

889
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Justin wren wants to fight Kimbo slice.</v>

890
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Kimbo slice to go night night cause Justin Wren,</v>

891
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.700
<v Speaker 1>you can hit that dude in the head with a rock.</v>

892
00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:19.451
<v Speaker 1>I think he's,</v>

893
00:22:19.451 --> 00:22:20.051
<v Speaker 1>I think a real,</v>

894
00:22:20.051 --> 00:22:21.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Justin knocked him out.</v>

895
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.490
<v Speaker 1>I think Justin takes them down and beats the shit out here.</v>

896
00:22:23.491 --> 00:22:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Then you piece of shit out of him.</v>

897
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.140
<v Speaker 1>He takes him down if he wants to.</v>

898
00:22:26.141 --> 00:22:27.040
<v Speaker 1>But if you standing with them,</v>

899
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.360
<v Speaker 1>all he has to do is keep moving.</v>

900
00:22:28.361 --> 00:22:29.140
<v Speaker 1>But you know Justin,</v>

901
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.240
<v Speaker 1>the reason Justin wants to,</v>

902
00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.310
<v Speaker 1>cause it's such a big fight so he can build wells and fucking Africa.</v>

903
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.050
<v Speaker 1>That's why he was such a mainstream fight.</v>

904
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.220
<v Speaker 1>He's dancing another dude.</v>

905
00:22:36.221 --> 00:22:36.480
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

906
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.420
<v Speaker 1>it's why he deserves it too.</v>

907
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.120
<v Speaker 1>He's just it.</v>

908
00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.420
<v Speaker 1>He's awesome and he felt,</v>

909
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.911
<v Speaker 1>or smart.</v>

910
00:22:39.911 --> 00:22:41.050
<v Speaker 1>They should do it to get short,</v>

911
00:22:41.051 --> 00:22:42.190
<v Speaker 1>especially Kimball's last fight.</v>

912
00:22:42.191 --> 00:22:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Let's figure this out.</v>

913
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:43.990
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

914
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:45.070
<v Speaker 1>not be as long as fine.</v>

915
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Well No,</v>

916
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying it should be his last fight.</v>

917
00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:49.413
<v Speaker 1>It's whatever.</v>

918
00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:54.370
<v Speaker 1>You know Justin and Kimbo or Swiss fine on the ultimate fighter 10 it was lined</v>

919
00:22:54.371 --> 00:22:56.320
<v Speaker 1>up and then the suits came in.</v>

920
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.000
<v Speaker 1>They were supposed to fight the week up.</v>

921
00:22:58.001 --> 00:22:58.511
<v Speaker 1>The fight,</v>

922
00:22:58.511 --> 00:22:59.410
<v Speaker 1>the suits came in like,</v>

923
00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:00.640
<v Speaker 1>uh hey Justin.</v>

924
00:23:00.641 --> 00:23:03.340
<v Speaker 1>They sat Justin down like for ratings,</v>

925
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:03.911
<v Speaker 1>we got to do this.</v>

926
00:23:03.911 --> 00:23:05.070
<v Speaker 1>And then they put in,</v>

927
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.520
<v Speaker 1>then they put in Roy Nelson.</v>

928
00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Well that's even dumber because Roy Nelson is very fucking skill to know they</v>

929
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:13.763
<v Speaker 1>want to pay them.</v>

930
00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really Nelson.</v>

931
00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

932
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.500
<v Speaker 1>but nobody know who Roy was back 10.</v>

933
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

934
00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Roy's,</v>

935
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:18.911
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

936
00:23:18.911 --> 00:23:19.900
<v Speaker 1>he's pretty big.</v>

937
00:23:19.901 --> 00:23:20.530
<v Speaker 1>I think they,</v>

938
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they wanted Kimbo to do wells.</v>

939
00:23:22.571 --> 00:23:23.290
<v Speaker 1>What I'm trying to tell him,</v>

940
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:23.410
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

941
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.770
<v Speaker 1>like the UFC did was they knew he was going to lose because to be honest,</v>

942
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.730
<v Speaker 1>anyone with a good set of skills during the beat Kimbo so whoever got that first</v>

943
00:23:30.731 --> 00:23:31.480
<v Speaker 1>crack at him,</v>

944
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.740
<v Speaker 1>he was probably gonna get fucked up.</v>

945
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:33.820
<v Speaker 1>So he fought Justin.</v>

946
00:23:33.821 --> 00:23:34.151
<v Speaker 1>Justin,</v>

947
00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:36.220
<v Speaker 1>you'd be and become a star Roy,</v>

948
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.010
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

949
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

950
00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.620
<v Speaker 1>So it's a big fight.</v>

951
00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:39.550
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want him to do well.</v>

952
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Roy was by far the worst matchup.</v>

953
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Justin was supposed to find him.</v>

954
00:23:42.561 --> 00:23:43.690
<v Speaker 1>The coach had all matched up.</v>

955
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.710
<v Speaker 1>They Yanked Justin,</v>

956
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.610
<v Speaker 1>insert fucking Roy Nelson</v>

957
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.450
<v Speaker 5>with 30 fights.</v>

958
00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:48.320
<v Speaker 5>Enjoy joy that Kimbo.</v>

959
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:48.580

00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:54.240
<v Speaker 5>Let's do it.</v>

966
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to build some fucking wells.</v>

967
00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

968
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.550
<v Speaker 5>he's definitely got a different motivation than everybody else.</v>

969
00:23:58.551 --> 00:23:58.701

<v Speaker 5>I bought myself a gift for having a baby.</v>

989
00:24:25.071 --> 00:24:25.850
<v Speaker 5>I guess you get them on.</v>

1005
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.213
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>

1006
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:44.570
<v Speaker 5>Flattened out.</v>

1007
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.553
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

1008
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.260
<v Speaker 5>Crouse escape back to his back.</v>

1009
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 5>He can escape and Tom Triangle right there.</v>

1010
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:51.590
<v Speaker 5>Soon as he turns,</v>

1011
00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:56.820
<v Speaker 5>he's too smart for that son and he just one or the other and it's going to have</v>

1012
00:24:57.021 --> 00:24:58.630
<v Speaker 5>it as a back taken still dude.</v>

1013
00:24:58.631 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 5>That Mcgregor dos Anjos makes my dick hard.</v>

1014
00:25:01.371 --> 00:25:02.204
<v Speaker 5>Even that flyer right?</v>

1015
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:03.343
<v Speaker 5>It makes it,</v>

1016
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.120
<v Speaker 5>it makes other people's dicks hard.</v>

1017
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:06.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to say something crazy,</v>

1018
00:25:06.201 --> 00:25:06.420
<v Speaker 5>Joe.</v>

1019
00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.070
<v Speaker 5>You ready for this?</v>

1020
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.580
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1021
00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:12.580
<v Speaker 5>I think the toughest matchup possible in the UFC for Mcgregor is dos Anjos.</v>

1022
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.170
<v Speaker 5>I think the easier fight is Robbie Lawler form.</v>

1023
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:16.663
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1024
00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:17.720

<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

1052
00:25:58.851 --> 00:26:01.950
<v Speaker 5>He's got the Bruce Lee [inaudible].</v>

1053
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:05.360
<v Speaker 5>What he did to Johnny Hendricks should be against the law.</v>

1054
00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:08.750
<v Speaker 5>They should have shut the lights off.</v>

1055
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.040
<v Speaker 5>They should have separated them and go,</v>

1056
00:26:10.041 --> 00:26:10.191
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

1057
00:26:10.191 --> 00:26:10.301

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:13.490
<v Speaker 5>We need to stop this.</v>

1061
00:26:13.491 --> 00:26:14.720
<v Speaker 5>Hendrix came in shape,</v>

1062
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:15.390
<v Speaker 5>had all his shots.</v>

1063
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:16.760
<v Speaker 5>Fucking shit figured out.</v>

1064
00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:18.460
<v Speaker 5>Biggest karate right now.</v>

1065
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.290
<v Speaker 5>Johnny got is strong fuck life for years.</v>

1066
00:26:21.291 --> 00:26:25.280
<v Speaker 5>That sport karate has this one element that no one knows how to fuck with these</v>

1067
00:26:25.281 --> 00:26:26.150
<v Speaker 5>blitz guys.</v>

1068
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.290
<v Speaker 5>He's Raymond Daniels,</v>

1069
00:26:27.291 --> 00:26:31.190
<v Speaker 5>guys that jump in and attack and then jump out before you can do anything about</v>

1070
00:26:31.191 --> 00:26:31.460
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1071
00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.960
<v Speaker 5>And if you don't have like some serious Nikki holds can style or Joseph</v>

1072
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.920
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] style Moitai skills.</v>

1073
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.140
<v Speaker 5>Well you can hands up high and chop those legs.</v>

1074
00:26:39.141 --> 00:26:39.860
<v Speaker 5>Has that right now,</v>

1075
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 5>no one has no one in the UFC has it rebel Raymond Daniels does to everybody</v>

1076
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.510
<v Speaker 3>except Niki holds skin and and Joseph Valtellina in in glory.</v>

1077
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.720
<v Speaker 3>Valtellina was the first guy exposed at chop those legs down,</v>

1078
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:52.650
<v Speaker 3>hands up high,</v>

1079
00:26:52.651 --> 00:26:53.484
<v Speaker 3>good guard,</v>

1080
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:54.001
<v Speaker 3>attack,</v>

1081
00:26:54.001 --> 00:26:54.391
<v Speaker 3>attack,</v>

1082
00:26:54.391 --> 00:26:57.220
<v Speaker 3>attack the legs and eventually chop him down and he had kicked him.</v>

1083
00:26:57.221 --> 00:26:58.050
<v Speaker 3>Who stops him?</v>

1084
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:01.470
<v Speaker 3>And the same thing we'd Nikki hold skin is that super solid Moitai base.</v>

1085
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:04.950
<v Speaker 3>But everybody else gets three 60 wheel kicked in the head.</v>

1086
00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:05.460
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1087
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.590
<v Speaker 3>he hits you that this memo jumping sidekick touches you with a side kick and</v>

1088
00:27:09.591 --> 00:27:11.460
<v Speaker 3>then spins the backache to the city.</v>

1089
00:27:11.461 --> 00:27:15.150
<v Speaker 3>So I think one Wonderboy right now beats everyone said every worst matchup for</v>

1090
00:27:15.151 --> 00:27:15.660
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

1091
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.493
<v Speaker 3>Roy McDonald,</v>

1092
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.430
<v Speaker 3>he's too smart.</v>

1093
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:21.360
<v Speaker 3>I think you guys always fight next fuck off Roy MacDonald.</v>

1094
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.500
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm hearing.</v>

1095
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.350
<v Speaker 3>I could see Roy thrown a real heavy,</v>

1096
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.710
<v Speaker 3>I got form system.</v>

1097
00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.360
<v Speaker 3>Let's let Wonderboy do his thing.</v>

1098
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.400
<v Speaker 3>Why would you give him the worst matchup possible?</v>

1099
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.700
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't you give Rory and opportunity to stop the hype train if that's</v>

1100
00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:33.534
<v Speaker 3>what's going to happen.</v>

1101
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:34.141
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

1102
00:27:34.141 --> 00:27:34.291
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1103
00:27:34.291 --> 00:27:34.801
<v Speaker 3>What do you think Roy?</v>

1104
00:27:34.801 --> 00:27:35.670
<v Speaker 3>He's gonna be able to do to him.</v>

1105
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.870
<v Speaker 3>He just wants to wear his skin.</v>

1106
00:27:36.871 --> 00:27:37.704
<v Speaker 3>That's all</v>

1107
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:40.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1108
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.700
<v Speaker 3>came into the world to smarter than Americans.</v>

1109
00:27:42.701 --> 00:27:42.961
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1110
00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:45.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's 100% it's a rumor I saw.</v>

1111
00:27:45.181 --> 00:27:45.870
<v Speaker 3>I saw it was a room.</v>

1112
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:48.140
<v Speaker 3>That's why I mentioned might've done a little fuck.</v>

1113
00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:49.163
<v Speaker 3>It's a room.</v>

1114
00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.270
<v Speaker 3>I might where a hyped it up already that it hasn't aired yet.</v>

1115
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:55.051
<v Speaker 3>It might have happened.</v>

1116
00:27:55.051 --> 00:27:55.741
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't remember.</v>

1117
00:27:55.741 --> 00:27:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I'd be breaking news fingers.</v>

1118
00:27:58.471 --> 00:27:58.711
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1119
00:27:58.711 --> 00:28:03.711
<v Speaker 3>That one can sing 15% growing McDonald's too smart to fall into his traps and</v>

1120
00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:05.170
<v Speaker 3>the case.</v>

1121
00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:06.003
<v Speaker 3>So what does he do?</v>

1122
00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.690
<v Speaker 3>He's got to kickbox with them when they're on the outside and that's where your</v>

1123
00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.260
<v Speaker 3>stab is fucking nasty.</v>

1124
00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:12.060
<v Speaker 3>And then as soon as Roy gets comfortable,</v>

1125
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.350
<v Speaker 3>but he fucks everybody.</v>

1126
00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:14.150
<v Speaker 3>What does that,</v>

1127
00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:15.210
<v Speaker 3>that was a giant one,</v>

1128
00:28:15.211 --> 00:28:15.810
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

1129
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:17.750
<v Speaker 3>That's the biggest battery I've ever seen.</v>

1130
00:28:17.751 --> 00:28:18.584
<v Speaker 3>Anyone of those things.</v>

1131
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:22.470
<v Speaker 3>That thing is like a paper towel roll anymore.</v>

1132
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.740
<v Speaker 3>How long has that battery last?</v>

1133
00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.131
<v Speaker 3>Let me see.</v>

1134
00:28:26.131 --> 00:28:26.964
<v Speaker 3>The last thing.</v>

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:36.830
<v Speaker 3>Smoke a lot.</v>

1141
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:37.111
<v Speaker 3>No one.</v>

1142
00:28:37.111 --> 00:28:37.944
<v Speaker 3>I knew that about you.</v>

1143
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:38.431

1167
00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:12.810
<v Speaker 3>It's just not even in the same.</v>

1168
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:16.170
<v Speaker 3>He'd be sure about this hands on 100% his hands are better than wonder boys,</v>

1169
00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:16.560
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1170
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.321
<v Speaker 3>And wonder boy,</v>

1171
00:29:17.321 --> 00:29:18.720
<v Speaker 3>he's got some fucking vicious hands.</v>

1172
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.130
<v Speaker 3>That's what knockout power.</v>

1173
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.410
<v Speaker 3>What Connor has in that left hand is what for us,</v>

1174
00:29:23.411 --> 00:29:23.761
<v Speaker 3>a hobby.</v>

1175
00:29:23.761 --> 00:29:25.140
<v Speaker 3>He likes to call it the touch of death.</v>

1176
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:30.480
<v Speaker 3>I liked the one 45 55 and 75 you're talking about big boy was knocking</v>

1177
00:29:30.481 --> 00:29:33.180
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers dead at one 55 with one punch.</v>

1178
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.860
<v Speaker 3>He was doing it all throughout England.</v>

1179
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:35.431
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1180
00:29:35.431 --> 00:29:38.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he could do that in the UFC at one 55 different level.</v>

1181
00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.420
<v Speaker 3>Mother,</v>

1182
00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:41.810
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1183
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:42.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

1184
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:42.200
<v Speaker 1>tea.</v>

1185
00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.100
<v Speaker 1>You are right though.</v>

1186
00:29:43.101 --> 00:29:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Sandra's is a beast.</v>

1187
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.230
<v Speaker 1>But I believe the kind of power that Connor has,</v>

1188
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.390
<v Speaker 1>you just has that undeniable.</v>

1189
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.180
<v Speaker 1>It's undeniable.</v>

1190
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know if he's going to be able to do it because here's the thing</v>

1191
00:29:54.791 --> 00:29:55.261
<v Speaker 1>about those.</v>

1192
00:29:55.261 --> 00:29:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Angela's still Sangiovese is a gap closer and then mother fucker closes gaps on</v>

1193
00:29:58.991 --> 00:30:01.180
<v Speaker 1>you before you even realized he's on top of you.</v>

1194
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.820
<v Speaker 1>He did it the doubt to Donald and he did it to pedis.</v>

1195
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Two guys who were pretty fucking skillful strikers.</v>

1196
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:10.420
<v Speaker 1>He closes that distance on you in a surprising way and there's no hesitation.</v>

1197
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:14.080
<v Speaker 1>No hesitation is grappling is outstanding and there's no hesitation in his game.</v>

1198
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.161
<v Speaker 1>And with that,</v>

1199
00:30:15.161 --> 00:30:16.630
<v Speaker 1>nick curse on do training him,</v>

1200
00:30:16.631 --> 00:30:17.020
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1201
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.690
<v Speaker 1>he's got 15 gas tanks and they're already,</v>

1202
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:21.280
<v Speaker 1>they're already a movement coach though.</v>

1203
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:22.780
<v Speaker 1>He's the movement coach.</v>

1204
00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:22.960
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1205
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.260
<v Speaker 1>they're doing all these crazy plyometric jails was a prime interest.</v>

1206
00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.093
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got,</v>

1207
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:27.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1208
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:27.781
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1209
00:30:27.781 --> 00:30:28.081
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

00:30:28.081 --> 00:30:28.970
<v Speaker 1>you got um,</v>

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:29.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1212
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:32.350
<v Speaker 1>fucking he's get king's MMA right.</v>

1213
00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:33.323
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1214
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:33.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1215
00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll feel court Darrell's one of the greatest striking instructors in the world.</v>

1216
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:38.410
<v Speaker 1>He's got Fabrizio over doom there.</v>

1217
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.390
<v Speaker 1>You've got a shitload of animals to train with.</v>

1218
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:41.660
<v Speaker 1>He's a complete animal.</v>

1219
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

1220
00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:43.890
<v Speaker 1>as far as natural buys,</v>

1221
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.800
<v Speaker 1>you bake the fight down.</v>

1222
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:45.661
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of it.</v>

1223
00:30:45.661 --> 00:30:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Worst matchup for Connor.</v>

1224
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:47.890
<v Speaker 1>He beats him.</v>

1225
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.240
<v Speaker 1>They're both in their prime.</v>

1226
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.141
<v Speaker 1>If he beats him,</v>

1227
00:30:50.141 --> 00:30:54.070
<v Speaker 1>he goes right to Robbie Lawler for UFC 200 and the world exploded.</v>

1228
00:30:54.071 --> 00:30:54.701
<v Speaker 1>If he beats him.</v>

1229
00:30:54.701 --> 00:30:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Aliens land a fighter of all time.</v>

1230
00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.173
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1231
00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1232
00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.600
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1233
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

1234
00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.600
<v Speaker 1>here's an argument that I was having with somebody.</v>

1235
00:31:01.601 --> 00:31:02.500
<v Speaker 1>This is a discussion.</v>

1236
00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:03.850
<v Speaker 1>This is a legit question.</v>

1237
00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Mighty mouse right now degrees the best pound for pound guy to Saint John John's</v>

1238
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.393
<v Speaker 1>Ursula</v>

1239
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:11.793
<v Speaker 1>daring</v>

1240
00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.900
<v Speaker 1>because the risk,</v>

1241
00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.100
<v Speaker 1>the risk to reward.</v>

1242
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.000
<v Speaker 1>He can make mistakes.</v>

1243
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.560
<v Speaker 1>He's destroying the competition,</v>

1244
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:18.880
<v Speaker 1>but he couldn't make mistakes with Dotson.</v>

1245
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Dotson dead with one shot different,</v>

1246
00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.240
<v Speaker 1>different than Jon Jones.</v>

1247
00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Gustin rumble.</v>

1248
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:24.913
<v Speaker 1>Rumble.</v>

1249
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.290
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with Gustafson.</v>

1250
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:30.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't think guts dead with one punch and easier than Dotson does it?</v>

1251
00:31:30.011 --> 00:31:30.401
<v Speaker 1>Matter of fact,</v>

1252
00:31:30.401 --> 00:31:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I think Dodson offers more danger on the feet.</v>

1253
00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:33.523
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>

1254
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1255
00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:35.020
<v Speaker 1>But we're allowed to,</v>

1256
00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:35.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1257
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.990
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1258
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:37.870
<v Speaker 1>One 20 zero,</v>

1259
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:38.440
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

1260
00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:38.741
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1261
00:31:38.741 --> 00:31:39.940
<v Speaker 1>so at the very least,</v>

1262
00:31:39.941 --> 00:31:41.230
<v Speaker 1>he's number two pound for pound.</v>

1263
00:31:41.231 --> 00:31:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Best in the world.</v>

1264
00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1265
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1266
00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:43.211
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1267
00:31:43.211 --> 00:31:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I think he's number one.</v>

1268
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.240
<v Speaker 1>A lot of other people's thinking is done want including boss route and,</v>

1269
00:31:46.241 --> 00:31:47.021
<v Speaker 1>but what the fuck she now,</v>

1270
00:31:47.021 --> 00:31:47.854
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1271
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan buzzers.</v>

1272
00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.741
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

1273
00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:51.860
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

1274
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.290
<v Speaker 1>if so Hutto beats him.</v>

1275
00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:56.410
<v Speaker 1>He's an Olympic gold medalists and wrestling.</v>

1276
00:31:56.530 --> 00:32:01.060
<v Speaker 1>So he becomes the first Olympic gold medalist and wrestling that wins a</v>

1277
00:32:01.061 --> 00:32:02.080
<v Speaker 1>flyweight title.</v>

1278
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1279
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:05.740
<v Speaker 1>And he beats arguably the best guy ever.</v>

1280
00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1281
00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.940
<v Speaker 1>If Demetrius Mighty Mouse Johnson is the best guy right now and you fought him</v>

1282
00:32:09.941 --> 00:32:10.390
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

1283
00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:11.200
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1284
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.033
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1285
00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.890
<v Speaker 1>You look at them like today and you look at what he's been able to do over his</v>

1286
00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:15.724
<v Speaker 1>last few fights.</v>

1287
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:17.650
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to argue more dominant champion.</v>

1288
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.480
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't get hit.</v>

1289
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1290
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.240
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get hit by the best guys.</v>

1291
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Cruise beat them.</v>

1292
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1293
00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.890
<v Speaker 1>A long time ago at one 35 he's a different fighter then.</v>

1294
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Just say Ian,</v>

1295
00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:26.440
<v Speaker 1>arguably one as well.</v>

1296
00:32:26.441 --> 00:32:27.274
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that.</v>

1297
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not my pound for pound number.</v>

1298
00:32:29.051 --> 00:32:29.381
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1299
00:32:29.381 --> 00:32:30.460
<v Speaker 1>But that's a long time ago.</v>

1300
00:32:30.461 --> 00:32:30.731
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

1301
00:32:30.731 --> 00:32:31.500
<v Speaker 1>they'll sign.</v>

1302
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I Click Guido,</v>

1303
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:33.880
<v Speaker 1>who's John Jones lost too.</v>

1304
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:34.923
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

1305
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.400
<v Speaker 1>He lost the rule.</v>

1306
00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:39.380
<v Speaker 1>He lost her shitty even lose to mark them up.</v>

1307
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:40.640
<v Speaker 1>He lost to a shitty rule.</v>

1308
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:41.683
<v Speaker 1>The rule</v>

1309
00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.870
<v Speaker 1>separate his clavicle or setting up that fucking dumpy did him and animal.</v>

1310
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:48.531
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1311
00:32:48.531 --> 00:32:49.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1312
00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.050
<v Speaker 1>He separated his fucking elbow.</v>

1313
00:32:51.051 --> 00:32:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Driving into the ward was brutal.</v>

1314
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:53.894
<v Speaker 1>That was brutal.</v>

1315
00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Fucking a total dominant performance.</v>

1316
00:32:55.761 --> 00:32:56.870
<v Speaker 1>You can never call that a loss.</v>

1317
00:32:56.871 --> 00:32:59.840
<v Speaker 1>And I don't give a fuck what planet you're on the job.</v>

1318
00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.360
<v Speaker 1>We haven't seen John Lewis never lost a DJ.</v>

1319
00:33:02.361 --> 00:33:04.070
<v Speaker 1>We had seen John get there,</v>

1320
00:33:04.071 --> 00:33:04.821
<v Speaker 1>was so close,</v>

1321
00:33:04.821 --> 00:33:05.960
<v Speaker 1>like a fight with Ian Mccall.</v>

1322
00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:07.250
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're not my number one.</v>

1323
00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.360
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

1324
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a good argument.</v>

1325
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.531
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

1326
00:33:09.531 --> 00:33:10.364
<v Speaker 1>It's a good argument.</v>

1327
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.080
<v Speaker 1>I think John's the best,</v>

1328
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.080
<v Speaker 1>but Dj's definitely have their djs a fucking machines.</v>

1329
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.120
<v Speaker 1>So djs three here's my question.</v>

1330
00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:17.511
<v Speaker 1>If so,</v>

1331
00:33:17.511 --> 00:33:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Hutto beats him.</v>

1332
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Is he like the best combat sport athlete ever?</v>

1333
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck to do our work to do for sure,</v>

1334
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:25.460
<v Speaker 1>but if you have to defend it,</v>

1335
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:26.960
<v Speaker 1>if he can beat the best guy ever.</v>

1336
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Is it a styles?</v>

1337
00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean like arguably if you're looking at someone who's an Olympic gold medalist</v>

1338
00:33:31.781 --> 00:33:34.100
<v Speaker 1>and then becomes a world champion in the UFC,</v>

1339
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:35.800
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the great,</v>

1340
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.320
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1341
00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.720
<v Speaker 1>that's a massive resume.</v>

1342
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.270
<v Speaker 1>Like as far as like accomplishments on paper,</v>

1343
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.540
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that comes close is Allister winning the k one Grand Prix.</v>

1344
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:45.770
<v Speaker 1>If he won the UFC title,</v>

1345
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:46.391
<v Speaker 1>if asked,</v>

1346
00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:47.660
<v Speaker 1>or one that k one Grand Prix,</v>

1347
00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:48.860
<v Speaker 1>he won strike for us.</v>

1348
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.420
<v Speaker 1>He was the Strikeforce heavyweight champion.</v>

1349
00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.530
<v Speaker 1>He was a dream every way champion and like arguably in MMA Allister's one of,</v>

1350
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:56.150
<v Speaker 1>if not the most,</v>

1351
00:33:56.270 --> 00:34:00.770
<v Speaker 1>one of the most decorated guys in all sports by four k one Grand Prix is the</v>

1352
00:34:00.771 --> 00:34:01.310
<v Speaker 1>pinnacle,</v>

1353
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:04.030
<v Speaker 1>the pinnacle of men heavyweight kickbox is so if so,</v>

1354
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Hutto wins a gold fucking medal in the Olympic Games and then goes on to when</v>

1355
00:34:08.781 --> 00:34:09.614
<v Speaker 1>UFC goal.</v>

1356
00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.160
<v Speaker 1>He's right up there with one of the most accomplished mixed martial arts.</v>

1357
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:13.491
<v Speaker 1>Happy.</v>

1358
00:34:13.491 --> 00:34:14.151
<v Speaker 1>Definitely could be.</v>

1359
00:34:14.151 --> 00:34:15.890
<v Speaker 1>And they should be marketing the fucking to him.</v>

1360
00:34:15.891 --> 00:34:16.580
<v Speaker 1>To Mexico.</v>

1361
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1362
00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Cause I know fucking better be to second all the money.</v>

1363
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.570
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking stop it.</v>

1364
00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:24.613
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

1365
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Why is it hard to sell the flyweights and why is it hard to sell your weight</v>

1366
00:34:29.001 --> 00:34:29.680
<v Speaker 1>class?</v>

1367
00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:30.513
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1368
00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:31.820
<v Speaker 1>People are like Ron does.</v>

1369
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:33.570
<v Speaker 1>She's one 35 small isn't,</v>

1370
00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.000
<v Speaker 1>it's bigger than that.</v>

1371
00:34:35.001 --> 00:34:35.870
<v Speaker 1>When she makes more money,</v>

1372
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:39.140
<v Speaker 1>he's one 25 one 2030 pieces smaller.</v>

1373
00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.700
<v Speaker 1>The problem didn't even know what weight you fight.</v>

1374
00:34:40.701 --> 00:34:43.080
<v Speaker 1>That's why me and Rhonda will never fight this cause she weighs more than me.</v>

1375
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:45.650
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

1376
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:46.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange,</v>

1377
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange phenomenon because in boxing it's the same thing in boxing.</v>

1378
00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:52.550
<v Speaker 1>You get plucked a chuck Alito.</v>

1379
00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:53.690
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

1380
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1381
00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:54.830
<v Speaker 1>chocolate Taco.</v>

1382
00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:55.700
<v Speaker 1>The fuckers.</v>

1383
00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.000
<v Speaker 1>He's not bitches</v>

1384
00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:01.250
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1385
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:02.060
<v Speaker 1>it never really caught,</v>

1386
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 1>he was just a little too small.</v>

1387
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:03.890
<v Speaker 1>They're too small.</v>

1388
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Bad motherfucker.</v>

1389
00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:06.120
<v Speaker 1>He not just don't buy into it.</v>

1390
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Some stang man and he was in his prime.</v>

1391
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:11.720
<v Speaker 1>No needle Donaire can crack.</v>

1392
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:12.501
<v Speaker 1>Is it because you,</v>

1393
00:35:12.501 --> 00:35:13.040
<v Speaker 1>you want that.</v>

1394
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:13.873
<v Speaker 1>When you think of fighters,</v>

1395
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.930
<v Speaker 1>think of like heroes.</v>

1396
00:35:14.931 --> 00:35:15.450
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1397
00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:16.670
<v Speaker 1>You want to got to be able to be one of the APPS.</v>

1398
00:35:16.671 --> 00:35:17.690
<v Speaker 1>You want to get to be big.</v>

1399
00:35:17.691 --> 00:35:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1400
00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.490
<v Speaker 1>because people look at you and they're like,</v>

1401
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:20.533
<v Speaker 1>Ian Mccall,</v>

1402
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.280

<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1406
00:35:24.501 --> 00:35:24.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1407
00:35:24.651 --> 00:35:25.760
<v Speaker 1>in the real world,</v>

1408
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:28.100
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is when people are watching this shit,</v>

1409
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:30.440
<v Speaker 1>everybody thinks that they can kick ass when they watch this stuff.</v>

1410
00:35:30.441 --> 00:35:32.350
<v Speaker 1>It's one of Chris' Kamozi Cho rigs.</v>

1411
00:35:32.351 --> 00:35:33.300
<v Speaker 1>She'll raise those up.</v>

1412
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Just need to and the damn thing.</v>

1413
00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Forgive author doesn't give a fuck.</v>

1414
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>

1415
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 1>you want to talk about a world</v>

1416
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.933
<v Speaker 2>beater in the gym.</v>

1417
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.110
<v Speaker 2>I've heard stories about Joe rigs back when rich Franklin was a champion of,</v>

1418
00:35:43.111 --> 00:35:46.020
<v Speaker 2>people were saying if Joe rigs could fight in the octagon,</v>

1419
00:35:46.021 --> 00:35:47.490
<v Speaker 2>the way he spar sometimes,</v>

1420
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:52.670
<v Speaker 2>like he catches these rhythms where you mean he got it back then especially he's</v>

1421
00:35:52.711 --> 00:35:53.730
<v Speaker 2>had rough career.</v>

1422
00:35:53.731 --> 00:35:53.971
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1423
00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:56.220
<v Speaker 2>he's been a lot of fights and he's had a long,</v>

1424
00:35:56.221 --> 00:35:59.400
<v Speaker 2>long time up inside the octagon and other organizations,</v>

1425
00:35:59.401 --> 00:35:59.901
<v Speaker 2>he's been around.</v>

1426
00:35:59.901 --> 00:36:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rugs is a fucking real veteran.</v>

1427
00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Be 300 pounds.</v>

1428
00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:02.851
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1429
00:36:02.851 --> 00:36:02.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1430
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:04.650
<v Speaker 2>But when he was on fire,</v>

1431
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.060
<v Speaker 2>like when he was at his best,</v>

1432
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.880
<v Speaker 2>there were saying he was like hell on wheels in the gym.</v>

1433
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:09.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1434
00:36:09.021 --> 00:36:10.920
<v Speaker 2>I've heard though like if he could just get it together,</v>

1435
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.240
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking world champion.</v>

1436
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Do Chris Kamozi he's a motherfucker tough as shit in the Denver scene.</v>

1437
00:36:16.531 --> 00:36:18.060
<v Speaker 2>He was like the guy coming up,</v>

1438
00:36:18.061 --> 00:36:21.900
<v Speaker 2>he was like the man like the journeyman and I never trained with them and he was</v>

1439
00:36:21.901 --> 00:36:22.560
<v Speaker 2>a south bone.</v>

1440
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.960
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't find any south falls when I was getting ready to fight cro cop.</v>

1441
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 2>So they bring Kamozi in the nicest guy ever.</v>

1442
00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:29.430
<v Speaker 2>And his coach goes,</v>

1443
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.241
<v Speaker 2>hey listen man,</v>

1444
00:36:30.241 --> 00:36:31.380
<v Speaker 2>you're a lot picking and Chris.</v>

1445
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.570
<v Speaker 2>But he moves and you need a south pole.</v>

1446
00:36:33.571 --> 00:36:35.100
<v Speaker 2>So your coach college remember him down.</v>

1447
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.800
<v Speaker 2>But he has a fight his first UFC fight and he,</v>

1448
00:36:37.801 --> 00:36:40.950
<v Speaker 2>I think he's fighting Australia on like a two week notice and they go make sure</v>

1449
00:36:40.951 --> 00:36:41.461
<v Speaker 2>you don't hurt him.</v>

1450
00:36:41.461 --> 00:36:42.840
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard anyone really in my life.</v>

1451
00:36:42.841 --> 00:36:43.021
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1452
00:36:43.021 --> 00:36:43.171
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1453
00:36:43.171 --> 00:36:44.004
<v Speaker 2>no problem man.</v>

1454
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.250
<v Speaker 2>For whatever reason we're 30 seconds into it.</v>

1455
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:50.250
<v Speaker 2>I go to throw a hook and he like charges into it.</v>

1456
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Break his nose literally.</v>

1457
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.210
<v Speaker 2>So his first UFC fight had broken nose.</v>

1458
00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he won but he went through I think a decision.</v>

1459
00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.670
<v Speaker 2>He's a tough mother fucker man.</v>

1460
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:00.750
<v Speaker 2>He's very tough.</v>

1461
00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:01.560
<v Speaker 2>He's very tough.</v>

1462
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.760
<v Speaker 2>That's a hard thing in camp,</v>

1463
00:37:02.761 --> 00:37:03.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1464
00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:08.210
<v Speaker 2>How hard is it for guys like you where you have to work with lighter guys or</v>

1465
00:37:08.461 --> 00:37:11.010
<v Speaker 2>guys like you who have to work with heavier guys?</v>

1466
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Like we always say that the Jujitsu guys that have the best technique or the</v>

1467
00:37:15.571 --> 00:37:17.010
<v Speaker 2>guys who are the smaller guys,</v>

1468
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:18.023
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

1469
00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Eddie.</v>

1470
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:24.780
<v Speaker 2>Eddie style is your style was based a lot on when you didn't lift weights?</v>

1471
00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.793
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1472
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Based on weakness.</v>

1473
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.430
<v Speaker 2>But you're thinking about guys like Barrett Yoshida.</v>

1474
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.770
<v Speaker 2>You think about heuler like the smaller guys are known to have like this razor</v>

1475
00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:34.350
<v Speaker 2>razors,</v>

1476
00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:36.900
<v Speaker 2>the Mendez brothers razor sharp technique.</v>

1477
00:37:36.901 --> 00:37:37.734
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1478
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:38.251
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1479
00:37:38.251 --> 00:37:39.450
<v Speaker 2>those guys have to,</v>

1480
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:41.520
<v Speaker 2>if you're a trained for an MMA fight,</v>

1481
00:37:41.521 --> 00:37:44.250
<v Speaker 2>how often did you have to spar guys are like way heavier than you.</v>

1482
00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:45.121
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1483
00:37:45.121 --> 00:37:45.954
<v Speaker 2>we've been,</v>

1484
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.530
<v Speaker 2>I've been manicured for so long that it's,</v>

1485
00:37:48.531 --> 00:37:49.364
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

1486
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.540
<v Speaker 2>it's been a while to get anything out of it though.</v>

1487
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:52.320
<v Speaker 2>You don't when you're going to,</v>

1488
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.370
<v Speaker 2>whether it was a big guy,</v>

1489
00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:54.204
<v Speaker 2>you're so smart.</v>

1490
00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.200
<v Speaker 2>When you're saying by manicured me,</v>

1491
00:37:56.201 --> 00:37:56.760
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>

1492
00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.430
<v Speaker 2>they take care of your camp much more efficiently than that.</v>

1493
00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.170
<v Speaker 2>We have so many because it's me and Carla.</v>

1494
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1495
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:03.000
<v Speaker 2>As far as under one roof,</v>

1496
00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:04.550
<v Speaker 2>calling her dramas,</v>

1497
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:05.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1498
00:38:05.641 --> 00:38:08.180
<v Speaker 2>he was Tito's coach and around forever and forever.</v>

1499
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:09.150
<v Speaker 2>We are respected.</v>

1500
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:09.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1501
00:38:09.321 --> 00:38:10.320
<v Speaker 2>And then Jason House,</v>

1502
00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:12.180
<v Speaker 2>my agent always has guys in the gym.</v>

1503
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.100
<v Speaker 2>There's just tons of small guys,</v>

1504
00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:14.910
<v Speaker 2>small guys.</v>

1505
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:15.950
<v Speaker 2>We have 50 people that,</v>

1506
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:16.560
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1507
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:16.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1508
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:18.100
<v Speaker 2>can fight amateur level,</v>

1509
00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.580
<v Speaker 2>the pro and they're all under one 50.</v>

1510
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.640
<v Speaker 2>That's the advantage of just the advantage that we have.</v>

1511
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:25.380
<v Speaker 2>You know what the in his camp,</v>

1512
00:38:25.381 --> 00:38:26.214
<v Speaker 2>it's an advantage.</v>

1513
00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:27.323
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's camp.</v>

1514
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:28.710
<v Speaker 2>The small guys are everywhere.</v>

1515
00:38:28.711 --> 00:38:28.980
<v Speaker 2>I hate,</v>

1516
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1517
00:38:29.251 --> 00:38:29.780
<v Speaker 2>small guys,</v>

1518
00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.450
<v Speaker 2>right guys?</v>

1519
00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:32.270
<v Speaker 2>It's filled.</v>

1520
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:34.920
<v Speaker 2>It's willing to fight MMA,</v>

1521
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:37.310
<v Speaker 5>MMA,</v>

1522
00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:39.540
<v Speaker 5>boxing we were talking about earlier but you know,</v>

1523
00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.780
<v Speaker 5>we want to watch bigger guys.</v>

1524
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:44.770
<v Speaker 5>I think maybe we want to watch bigger guys cause it's bigger guys hit harder and</v>

1525
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:48.520
<v Speaker 5>bigger guys get knocked out easier and little guys just hard to knock out little</v>

1526
00:38:48.521 --> 00:38:53.230
<v Speaker 5>guys because in Jujitsu we'd rather watch the little guys because it's literally</v>

1527
00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:53.740
<v Speaker 5>gotten wore.</v>

1528
00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.900
<v Speaker 5>The little guys can choke out.</v>

1529
00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.880
<v Speaker 5>They could uh,</v>

1530
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.440
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

1531
00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.390
<v Speaker 5>they're generally more technical and you see more submissions with the little</v>

1532
00:39:01.391 --> 00:39:02.410
<v Speaker 5>guys or big guys.</v>

1533
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.490
<v Speaker 5>You see a bunch of dudes just holding and shit cause you don't really ask will</v>

1534
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.513
<v Speaker 5>that like,</v>

1535
00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.020
<v Speaker 5>okay look,</v>

1536
00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.990
<v Speaker 5>how about when Demetrius mighty mouse Johnson knocked out Benevidez with one</v>

1537
00:39:10.991 --> 00:39:11.500
<v Speaker 5>punch?</v>

1538
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.940
<v Speaker 5>I think if we saw that more often,</v>

1539
00:39:12.941 --> 00:39:14.010
<v Speaker 5>I think it little guys,</v>

1540
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it still works.</v>

1541
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:18.710
<v Speaker 5>I think of little guys got knocked out easier than big guys are more than big</v>

1542
00:39:18.711 --> 00:39:19.000
<v Speaker 5>guys.</v>

1543
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.681
<v Speaker 5>We would like to learn.</v>

1544
00:39:19.681 --> 00:39:20.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

1545
00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.450
<v Speaker 5>It's just not fair to him.</v>

1546
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.610
<v Speaker 5>It's the pure mass like even when's the last time you saw a small gun?</v>

1547
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.210
<v Speaker 5>A porno even in everything.</v>

1548
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:28.420
<v Speaker 5>Think about it.</v>

1549
00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.440
<v Speaker 5>Even in Pornos,</v>

1550
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:32.530
<v Speaker 5>they're fucking big dude's got it.</v>

1551
00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:37.210
<v Speaker 5>This is what I'm thinking smaller with regular Dick so that they lick the dick</v>

1552
00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:40.540
<v Speaker 5>look bigger than the guy with the big boys.</v>

1553
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:41.860
<v Speaker 5>Psychologically,</v>

1554
00:39:41.861 --> 00:39:45.880
<v Speaker 5>if you watch someone and even if he beats up someone who's smaller than you,</v>

1555
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.560
<v Speaker 5>if you can say in your head,</v>

1556
00:39:47.561 --> 00:39:48.251
<v Speaker 5>even if you're wrong,</v>

1557
00:39:48.251 --> 00:39:49.084
<v Speaker 5>if you can say in your head,</v>

1558
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.080
<v Speaker 5>couldn't do that to me,</v>

1559
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:51.370
<v Speaker 5>then you're not as impressed.</v>

1560
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:51.590
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1561
00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:52.690
<v Speaker 5>It's like when you watch rumble,</v>

1562
00:39:52.691 --> 00:39:53.710
<v Speaker 5>put someone in orbit.</v>

1563
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:54.221
<v Speaker 5>It's nothing.</v>

1564
00:39:54.221 --> 00:39:56.890
<v Speaker 5>Can you see rumble hit people and put them in orbit and you just go,</v>

1565
00:39:56.891 --> 00:39:57.671
<v Speaker 5>oh fuck,</v>

1566
00:39:57.671 --> 00:39:58.660
<v Speaker 5>I got to get out of this room.</v>

1567
00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:05.590
<v Speaker 5>It's a totally different straight appeal because he's so fucking powerful.</v>

1568
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.780
<v Speaker 5>Two Oh five that you like,</v>

1569

1733
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:29.840
<v Speaker 3>But I felt like,</v>

1734
00:44:29.841 --> 00:44:30.290
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1735
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:32.030
<v Speaker 3>he got a raw deal in the favor</v>

1736
00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:32.883
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

1737
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:33.610
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1738
00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1739
00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:36.240
<v Speaker 1>and then they to stand right in front of Leonard,</v>

1740
00:44:36.241 --> 00:44:38.370
<v Speaker 1>go like that and just throw down his next fight.</v>

1741
00:44:38.371 --> 00:44:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Like this is crazy.</v>

1742
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he just thought that he could get him.</v>

1743
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I think he did.</v>

1744
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1745
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.940
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1746
00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's what it came down to.</v>

1747
00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Kind of spooky.</v>

1748
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.461
<v Speaker 1>He Spooky.</v>

1749
00:44:47.461 --> 00:44:48.294
<v Speaker 1>Spooky.</v>

1750
00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:50.220
<v Speaker 1>That was my favorite fight on this card.</v>

1751
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1752
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Cody verse Linda Curt.</v>

1753
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:52.501
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking,</v>

1754
00:44:52.501 --> 00:44:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Dan gave that shit away from us.</v>

1755
00:44:54.331 --> 00:44:54.591
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1756
00:44:54.591 --> 00:44:57.120
<v Speaker 1>That mosquito said not on my watch and he do shit.</v>

1757
00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:01.260
<v Speaker 1>He seems to be just as heavy handed at one 35 which made this fight so far.</v>

1758
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Great match though.</v>

1759
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1760
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.823
<v Speaker 1>Illinois.</v>

1761
00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.230
<v Speaker 1>This guy beat half a Mendez.</v>

1762
00:45:10.231 --> 00:45:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1763
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Although like fine advantage or something like that,</v>

1764
00:45:12.301 --> 00:45:17.301
<v Speaker 1>but still just to even tie half monster,</v>

1765
00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.310
<v Speaker 1>half amended from tapping you.</v>

1766
00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:21.061
<v Speaker 1>It's cute.</v>

1767
00:45:21.061 --> 00:45:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Like you survived.</v>

1768
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.531
<v Speaker 1>It's cool.</v>

1769
00:45:22.531 --> 00:45:24.090
<v Speaker 1>But I don't see someone get punched in the face,</v>

1770
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:26.280
<v Speaker 1>but that was in the g and he's,</v>

1771
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:26.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1772
00:45:26.671 --> 00:45:29.520
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know if all is Jiu Jitsu is going to translate to MMA.</v>

1773
00:45:29.521 --> 00:45:30.354
<v Speaker 1>We're going to see,</v>

1774
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:30.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1775
00:45:30.991 --> 00:45:32.910
<v Speaker 1>but a fucking poor Joe rigs,</v>

1776
00:45:32.911 --> 00:45:33.121
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1777
00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:33.954
<v Speaker 1>I hate seeing that.</v>

1778
00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:34.711
<v Speaker 1>Well man,</v>

1779
00:45:34.711 --> 00:45:35.460
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1780
00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Kamasi did what he wanted to do and rigs didn't get a chance to do it.</v>

1781
00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:38.581
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>

1782
00:45:38.581 --> 00:45:39.690
<v Speaker 1>his arm is fucked up,</v>

1783
00:45:39.691 --> 00:45:39.841
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1784
00:45:39.841 --> 00:45:40.674
<v Speaker 1>He's holding his arm.</v>

1785
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Think about how many needs he took that he blocked on that arm.</v>

1786
00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:44.850
<v Speaker 1>What are the odds that arm is broken?</v>

1787
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:45.811
<v Speaker 1>Pretty High,</v>

1788
00:45:45.811 --> 00:45:46.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1789
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I would say 85%.</v>

1790
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.880
<v Speaker 1>26 guys hit with some bombs there.</v>

1791
00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1792
00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.550
<v Speaker 1>there was some bombs.</v>

1793
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:55.463
<v Speaker 1>I hate seeing those,</v>

1794
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:57.900
<v Speaker 1>that it's a rough sport.</v>

1795
00:45:57.901 --> 00:46:01.300
<v Speaker 1>My man is definitely not.</v>

1796
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I'll just tell you to ask you.</v>

1797
00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.140
<v Speaker 1>How's your shoulder brother?</v>

1798
00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:05.323
<v Speaker 2>That's fucked up.</v>

1799
00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

1800
00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1801
00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:09.310
<v Speaker 2>I probably shouldn't say anything but arm pop it again this week.</v>

1802
00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.810
<v Speaker 2>How long were you out for you?</v>

1803
00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:11.653
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

1804
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:14.470
<v Speaker 2>I had my bet I had surgery eight months ago.</v>

1805
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:18.370
<v Speaker 2>I had a fully torn bicep tendon to labral tears and a fully torn rotator cuff.</v>

1806
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:20.170
<v Speaker 2>So they redid the whole thing.</v>

1807
00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1808
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Carla actually had her lay room done a week before me and the doctor's like,</v>

1809
00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:24.611
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1810
00:46:24.611 --> 00:46:25.330
<v Speaker 2>we'll have it done.</v>

1811
00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:26.380
<v Speaker 2>Just like her same shit.</v>

1812
00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:27.423
<v Speaker 2>And after,</v>

1813
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:28.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1814
00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:30.220
<v Speaker 2>I remember I'm sitting there and he called me a couple of days later.</v>

1815
00:46:30.221 --> 00:46:30.431
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1816
00:46:30.431 --> 00:46:31.264
<v Speaker 2>so how are you doing?</v>

1817
00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:32.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1818
00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:32.950
<v Speaker 2>well dude,</v>

1819
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:34.720
<v Speaker 2>did you fucking tap dance on my shoulder?</v>

1820
00:46:34.721 --> 00:46:35.554
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>

1821
00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:36.100
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't,</v>

1822
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.960
<v Speaker 2>he told me everything he had to do and then,</v>

1823
00:46:37.961 --> 00:46:38.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1824
00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I had stem cell put in it.</v>

1825
00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1826
00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:41.621
<v Speaker 2>Thank you doctor.</v>

1827
00:46:41.621 --> 00:46:43.210
<v Speaker 2>Thermo's and,</v>

1828
00:46:43.211 --> 00:46:44.044
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1829
00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:44.890
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1830
00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:46.120
<v Speaker 2>it's really fucking strong.</v>

1831
00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:47.680
<v Speaker 2>My arm is strong,</v>

1832
00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:50.180
<v Speaker 2>but all the sudden I'll be moving and I'll throw it and it'll just,</v>

1833
00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.370
<v Speaker 2>just boom.</v>

1834
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:52.211
<v Speaker 2>I'm like fucking,</v>

1835
00:46:52.211 --> 00:46:53.070
<v Speaker 2>that'll hurt and you know,</v>

1836
00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:55.210
<v Speaker 2>it won't feel good and I'll kind of just keep shadowboxing.</v>

1837
00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Well it's been eight months.</v>

1838
00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:57.341
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1839
00:46:57.341 --> 00:47:01.570
<v Speaker 2>I throw a punch there the day doing like a movement drills around this ball and</v>

1840
00:47:01.571 --> 00:47:04.880
<v Speaker 2>it just pop and I just fell to the ground holding it pops.</v>

1841
00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:07.120
<v Speaker 2>Like get it like came out of socket.</v>

1842
00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:07.511
<v Speaker 2>Like none of that.</v>

1843
00:47:07.511 --> 00:47:07.781
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1844
00:47:07.781 --> 00:47:09.370
<v Speaker 2>I felt the pop somewhere in,</v>

1845
00:47:09.371 --> 00:47:11.350
<v Speaker 2>in my bicep to middle of my arm region.</v>

1846
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Did you get it checked out yet?</v>

1847
00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:12.761
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1848
00:47:12.761 --> 00:47:13.330
<v Speaker 2>And they're there.</v>

1849
00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:14.170
<v Speaker 2>They can't feel it.</v>

1850
00:47:14.171 --> 00:47:14.680
<v Speaker 2>It has no form,</v>

1851
00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:15.430
<v Speaker 2>no bruising,</v>

1852
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:16.263
<v Speaker 2>no MRI.</v>

1853
00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:16.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1854
00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:17.560
<v Speaker 2>not yet.</v>

1855
00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:17.891
<v Speaker 2>They're going to,</v>

1856
00:47:17.891 --> 00:47:18.521
<v Speaker 2>they're going to wait and see.</v>

1857
00:47:18.521 --> 00:47:20.980
<v Speaker 2>But I fractured and dislocated this elbow wrestling.</v>

1858
00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.290
<v Speaker 2>I've had three surgeries on this hand to breaks.</v>

1859
00:47:23.291 --> 00:47:24.820
<v Speaker 2>I've had a bad infection in his arm.</v>

1860
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1861
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:27.220
<v Speaker 2>I got two bulging discs.</v>

1862
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:28.703
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1863
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.110
<v Speaker 2>so this time</v>

1864
00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:31.260
<v Speaker 3>of volume two bulging disks.</v>

1865
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1866
00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:34.450
<v Speaker 3>This side of my body is kind of fucked up so that they did that.</v>

1867
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:34.901
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

1868
00:47:34.901 --> 00:47:37.270
<v Speaker 3>Probably related the bulging disc in your neck then?</v>

1869
00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1870
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:38.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1871
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:38.690
<v Speaker 3>Three,</v>

1872
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:38.941
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>

1873
00:47:38.941 --> 00:47:39.774
<v Speaker 3>four or five.</v>

1874
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:40.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1875
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.870
<v Speaker 3>that's right where the ULNA nerve was it like for me,</v>

1876
00:47:43.871 --> 00:47:45.940
<v Speaker 3>my issues with my neck went all the way down to my fingers.</v>

1877
00:47:45.941 --> 00:47:47.170
<v Speaker 3>Do you get any numbing in your fingers?</v>

00:48:02.921 --> 00:48:03.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1898
00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.300
<v Speaker 3>That might be his mom.</v>

1899
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:04.990
<v Speaker 3>His sister,</v>

1900
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.680
<v Speaker 3>his sister.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's young as fuck.</v>

1903
00:48:06.851 --> 00:48:07.684
<v Speaker 3>That's his mom.</v>

1904
00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:08.663
<v Speaker 3>He could be,</v>

1905
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:09.790
<v Speaker 3>what a handsome fella.</v>

1906
00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.500
<v Speaker 3>He needs a new haircut.</v>

1907
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:12.471
<v Speaker 3>He really need,</v>

1908
00:48:12.471 --> 00:48:13.430
<v Speaker 3>why does that,</v>

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:17.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a white young dawn.</v>

1911
00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:19.660
<v Speaker 3>If he's really a male model,</v>

1912
00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:20.210
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1913
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:21.043
<v Speaker 3>he would have a different haircut.</v>

1914
00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.380
<v Speaker 3>That community is so connected,</v>

1915
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.750
<v Speaker 3>like everybody into MMA knows,</v>

1916
00:48:25.751 --> 00:48:26.410
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1917
00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:29.050
<v Speaker 3>say sage loss and everyone's making fun of them now.</v>

1918
00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:29.561
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1919
00:48:29.561 --> 00:48:31.690
<v Speaker 3>That's like the general consensus consensus.</v>

1920
00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:32.550
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1921
00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:32.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1922
00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:33.461
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

1923
00:48:33.461 --> 00:48:34.294
<v Speaker 3>They can never</v>

1924
00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:37.880
<v Speaker 3>make fun of anyone anyways.</v>

1925
00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:39.550
<v Speaker 3>I didn't make fun of them.</v>

1926
00:48:39.551 --> 00:48:40.610
<v Speaker 3>I thought I signed him up.</v>

1927
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:42.490
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think he tab quick.</v>

1928
00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.140
<v Speaker 3>I thought that guy put a good choke on them.</v>

1929
00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:46.000
<v Speaker 3>I tell people with their arm like that all the time,</v>

1930
00:48:46.001 --> 00:48:46.600
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1931
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it was a quick tap.</v>

1932
00:48:48.041 --> 00:48:48.611
<v Speaker 3>It was legit.</v>

1933
00:48:48.611 --> 00:48:50.920
<v Speaker 3>That guy had a good squeeze on his hate comes from,</v>

1934
00:48:50.921 --> 00:48:51.870
<v Speaker 3>he got so much hype man,</v>

1935
00:48:51.871 --> 00:48:53.680
<v Speaker 3>you got paid so much more than other vets.</v>

1936
00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.540
<v Speaker 3>So other fighters kinda like what the fuck man,</v>

1937
00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.010
<v Speaker 3>but think if you're him,</v>

1938
00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:58.210
<v Speaker 3>if you're him you're like,</v>

1939
00:48:58.330 --> 00:48:58.601
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1940
00:48:58.601 --> 00:48:59.434
<v Speaker 3>I didn't ask her this.</v>

1941
00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:00.341
<v Speaker 3>Dana was like,</v>

1942
00:49:00.341 --> 00:49:01.031
<v Speaker 3>here's your contract.</v>

1943
00:49:01.031 --> 00:49:02.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like fun again.</v>

1944
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:06.910
<v Speaker 3>People were really concerned.</v>

1945
00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:07.660
<v Speaker 3>So hands on.</v>

1946
00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:11.050
<v Speaker 3>People really concerned that the other fighters or or like jealous.</v>

1947
00:49:11.051 --> 00:49:11.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people are,</v>

1948
00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:15.310
<v Speaker 3>the fighters are fighters put that out.</v>

1949
00:49:15.311 --> 00:49:16.070
<v Speaker 3>Like you're a boy,</v>

1950
00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:16.903
<v Speaker 3>Tony Ferguson,</v>

1951
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:17.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1952
00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.210
<v Speaker 3>Like when the fires put out then the fans go,</v>

1953
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:20.081
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1954
00:49:20.081 --> 00:49:21.050
<v Speaker 3>fuck that guy.</v>

1955
00:49:21.051 --> 00:49:21.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1956
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:23.470
<v Speaker 3>It's a natural reaction when someone's that beautiful.</v>

1957
00:49:23.471 --> 00:49:24.640
<v Speaker 3>They have so many advantages.</v>

1958
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.250
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

1959
00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:29.260
<v Speaker 3>A guy who's got,</v>

1960
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean nine to respect,</v>

1961
00:49:31.331 --> 00:49:33.760
<v Speaker 3>but Brian Barbarina his body on look nothing like that.</v>

1962
00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:36.070
<v Speaker 3>Regular Athlete's body.</v>

1963
00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:37.280
<v Speaker 3>So with a regular guy,</v>

1964
00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:38.643
<v Speaker 3>regular athletes,</v>

1965
00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:43.813
<v Speaker 3>Ferguson</v>

1966
00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:46.810
<v Speaker 3>whooped his ass,</v>

1967
00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:48.240
<v Speaker 3>he whipped his ass and you know,</v>

1968
00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.750
<v Speaker 3>they were all telling me after the fight,</v>

1969
00:49:49.751 --> 00:49:50.111
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1970
00:49:50.111 --> 00:49:50.441
<v Speaker 3>does he,</v>

1971
00:49:50.441 --> 00:49:51.840
<v Speaker 3>does he top guys like that all the time?</v>

1972
00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:52.061
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1973
00:49:52.061 --> 00:49:52.241
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1974
00:49:52.241 --> 00:49:53.500
<v Speaker 3>he squeezes ridiculous.</v>

1975
00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:55.030
<v Speaker 3>They say here's a six squeeze.</v>

1976
00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:55.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah you could tab.</v>

1977
00:49:55.721 --> 00:49:59.470
<v Speaker 3>And I was telling me he gets guys in that position and just taps everybody.</v>

1978
00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:03.670
<v Speaker 3>He apparently has this insane head and arm closure.</v>

1979
00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:06.750
<v Speaker 3>You know some guys get that and some guys just have that nasty,</v>

1980
00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:12.850
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't trying to pass or like improve his body position on that choke.</v>

1981
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:17.660
<v Speaker 3>When you see that and you stay in like sub a positions,</v>

1982
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:21.580
<v Speaker 3>you don't get the ultimate squeeze but you do control their body.</v>

1983
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.470
<v Speaker 3>That's when you know a guy knows what he's doing.</v>

1984
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:26.980
<v Speaker 3>If he's got to get all the way side control and lay on his stomach and start</v>

1985
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.450
<v Speaker 3>with you,</v>

1986
00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:27.750
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1987
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:28.221
<v Speaker 3>you gotta,</v>

1988
00:50:28.221 --> 00:50:29.580
<v Speaker 3>you gotta do all that to,</v>

1989
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:30.800
<v Speaker 3>to squeeze that in,</v>

1990
00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:31.820
<v Speaker 3>to get a tap out of that.</v>

1991
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.391
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

1992
00:50:32.391 --> 00:50:33.290
<v Speaker 3>that's amateur.</v>

1993
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:35.300
<v Speaker 3>What he did that was pro.</v>

1994
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:35.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1995
00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:36.490
<v Speaker 3>he stayed on the mount.</v>

1996
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.861
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1997
00:50:36.861 --> 00:50:37.910
<v Speaker 3>and he stayed in half guard.</v>

1998
00:50:37.911 --> 00:50:38.880
<v Speaker 3>He didn't even try to pass it.</v>

1999
00:50:38.881 --> 00:50:41.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna stay right here in Tampa and the sage kid,</v>

2000
00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:46.241
<v Speaker 3>he really did legitimately 100% have strep throat and he was in the hospital two</v>

2001
00:50:46.431 --> 00:50:47.450
<v Speaker 3>days before that fight.</v>

2002
00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:50.430
<v Speaker 3>So just imagine antibiotic and the antibiotic,</v>

2003
00:50:50.431 --> 00:50:54.260
<v Speaker 3>but just imagine having strep throat and having someone clamp down in your neck.</v>

2004
00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:54.741
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2005
00:50:54.741 --> 00:50:57.440
<v Speaker 3>you're already inflamed and a quick tap.</v>

2006
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:58.450
<v Speaker 3>100% yeah.</v>

2007
00:50:58.700 --> 00:50:59.451
<v Speaker 3>And you know what man?</v>

2008
00:50:59.451 --> 00:51:00.021
<v Speaker 3>He's a kid.</v>

2009
00:51:00.021 --> 00:51:01.220
<v Speaker 3>He's 19 years old.</v>

2010
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:02.780
<v Speaker 3>He's 19 years old and he's,</v>

2011
00:51:02.781 --> 00:51:03.950
<v Speaker 3>he's in there kicking ass.</v>

2012
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:06.770
<v Speaker 3>And how much policies coming his way,</v>

2013
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.060
<v Speaker 3>even measurable jazz off to the Bible though.</v>

2014
00:51:11.061 --> 00:51:11.894
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't touch</v>

2015
00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:14.713
<v Speaker 3>10 years.</v>

2016
00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:16.890

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:20.090

2020
00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:20.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2021
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:22.510
<v Speaker 3>I really can't think of that.</v>

2022
00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:24.620
<v Speaker 3>Tony Ferguson versus mega Madoff.</v>

2023
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:28.900
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking monster straight.</v>

2024
00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:30.620
<v Speaker 3>What I said when I did the countdown show,</v>

2025
00:51:30.621 --> 00:51:32.690
<v Speaker 3>I said this easily could be a world championship fight.</v>

2026
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:34.700
<v Speaker 3>Easy one of these guys easily either.</v>

2027
00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:35.930
<v Speaker 3>Either guy can be the champion,</v>

2028
00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.220
<v Speaker 3>either graph can be the challenger.</v>

2029
00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.900
<v Speaker 3>This is a legit world championship.</v>

2030
00:51:38.901 --> 00:51:40.250
<v Speaker 3>Caliber fighter factors,</v>

2031
00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:40.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2032
00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:41.570
<v Speaker 3>help,</v>

2033
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:42.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2034
00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:43.250
<v Speaker 3>the beeps body,</v>

2035
00:51:43.251 --> 00:51:43.990
<v Speaker 3>whether it's healthy,</v>

2036
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.370
<v Speaker 3>how's that?</v>

2037
00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:45.470
<v Speaker 3>How's he going to perform?</v>

2038
00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:48.020
<v Speaker 3>Taking all this time off and Tony's a motherfucker to fight.</v>

2039
00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:49.270
<v Speaker 3>Tony.</v>

2040
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:53.700
<v Speaker 3>Tony's hard to manhandle like mega men office used to manhandle them</v>

2041
00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:57.880
<v Speaker 3>and Tony Striking has gotten so goddamn good.</v>

2042
00:51:57.881 --> 00:51:58.540
<v Speaker 3>All your met off.</v>

2043
00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:00.200
<v Speaker 3>But if he gets a hold of Tony,</v>

2044
00:52:00.201 --> 00:52:01.280
<v Speaker 3>Tony's going for a ride,</v>

2045
00:52:01.281 --> 00:52:02.300
<v Speaker 3>but that's not going to face.</v>

2046
00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Tony wrestled in college.</v>

2047
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.591
<v Speaker 3>I train,</v>

2048
00:52:04.591 --> 00:52:05.424
<v Speaker 3>he's all,</v>

2049
00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.650
<v Speaker 3>he's all fuck.</v>

2050
00:52:06.651 --> 00:52:07.484
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to wrestling,</v>

2051
00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:08.380
<v Speaker 3>you have a,</v>

2052
00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:08.571
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2053
00:52:08.571 --> 00:52:12.830
<v Speaker 3>a perfect symmetrical wrestler who does everything correct over and over and</v>

2054
00:52:12.831 --> 00:52:13.430
<v Speaker 3>over and over again.</v>

2055
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.940
<v Speaker 3>All the guns.</v>

2056
00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:17.270
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden you have Tony who has great fucking basics,</v>

2057
00:52:17.271 --> 00:52:20.030
<v Speaker 3>but he's also hitting that wild ass Granby roll from every position.</v>

2058
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:23.270
<v Speaker 3>I wrestled like that guy and it was fucking boom,</v>

2059
00:52:23.271 --> 00:52:23.391
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

2060
00:52:23.391 --> 00:52:23.571
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

2061
00:52:23.571 --> 00:52:23.721
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

2062
00:52:23.721 --> 00:52:24.020
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

2063
00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:26.510
<v Speaker 3>So you know what wheels can catch on faster.</v>

2064
00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.141
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be,</v>

2065
00:52:27.141 --> 00:52:29.480
<v Speaker 3>cause they all filed cards number come out.</v>

2066
00:52:29.481 --> 00:52:31.190
<v Speaker 3>I would love to do is control.</v>

2067
00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.160
<v Speaker 3>He gets you on top of,</v>

2068
00:52:32.161 --> 00:52:33.950
<v Speaker 3>he beats the fuck out of you and holds you in place.</v>

2069
00:52:33.951 --> 00:52:35.690
<v Speaker 3>But toys so dynamic.</v>

2070
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:38.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he's gonna be able to hold him down the way he's be able to hold</v>

2071
00:52:38.241 --> 00:52:39.800
<v Speaker 3>other people down and I'd be in trouble.</v>

2072
00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:40.910
<v Speaker 3>And you can see guys,</v>

2073
00:52:40.911 --> 00:52:42.620
<v Speaker 3>when they fight Habib where they break,</v>

2074
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:44.300
<v Speaker 3>you can see where they're just like,</v>

2075
00:52:44.301 --> 00:52:45.920
<v Speaker 3>this motherfucker's still chose.</v>

2076
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:46.783
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2077
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:51.260
<v Speaker 3>Able to lead the fight to see him when he beat those angles.</v>

2078
00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:54.810
<v Speaker 3>I'll beat the fuck out all the rabid dog though.</v>

2079
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:55.100
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

2080
00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:56.300
<v Speaker 3>granted it was a few years,</v>

2081
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:59.610
<v Speaker 3>he gets a hold of you.</v>

2082
00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:00.700
<v Speaker 3>You're going for a ride.</v>

2083
00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.590
<v Speaker 3>He's got the best grappling in the division.</v>

2084
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:05.270
<v Speaker 3>Do you know about his dad?</v>

2085
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:05.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2086
00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:09.770
<v Speaker 3>I heard that serious fucking sambo cause long article about how awesome his</v>

2087
00:53:09.771 --> 00:53:10.601
<v Speaker 3>fucking dad isn't.</v>

2088
00:53:10.601 --> 00:53:11.434
<v Speaker 3>Samely isn't just,</v>

2089
00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:12.411
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2090
00:53:12.411 --> 00:53:12.970
<v Speaker 3>I fucking knew.</v>

2091
00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:13.880
<v Speaker 3>I knew I liked these guys.</v>

2092
00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:17.090
<v Speaker 3>Technical is fuck everything's perfect.</v>

2093
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:17.870
<v Speaker 3>All his position.</v>

2094
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:20.240
<v Speaker 3>But he's had so many injuries.</v>

2095
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2096
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:21.620
<v Speaker 3>horrible injuries too.</v>

2097
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:23.150
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible.</v>

2098
00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:24.950
<v Speaker 3>Like ACL,</v>

2099
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:25.800
<v Speaker 3>MCL,</v>

2100
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 3>he's</v>

2101
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:26.813
<v Speaker 1>blown his knees.</v>

2102
00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:27.840
<v Speaker 1>He blew his back out.</v>

2103
00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.030
<v Speaker 1>That changes everything when he got back from that.</v>

2104
00:53:30.031 --> 00:53:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Like your shot,</v>

2105
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:32.010
<v Speaker 1>especially when you fight a guy like Tony.</v>

2106
00:53:32.011 --> 00:53:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2107
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Because in football,</v>

2108
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:35.700
<v Speaker 1>you know when you come back from one knee surgery,</v>

2109
00:53:35.701 --> 00:53:39.390
<v Speaker 1>you may never be the same if you're a running back or a quarterback that</v>

2110
00:53:39.391 --> 00:53:39.961
<v Speaker 1>scrambles.</v>

2111
00:53:39.961 --> 00:53:41.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens to all the quarterbacks that scramble.</v>

2112
00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 1>They're doing great in college and they survive.</v>

2113
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.160
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as they get hurt in the pro game,</v>

2114
00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:46.831
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2115
00:53:46.831 --> 00:53:48.660
<v Speaker 1>now they got to stay in the pocket there.</v>

2116
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Their knees are shot and that's where they fucked [inaudible].</v>

2117
00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Way more demanding than that.</v>

2118
00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're avoiding things.</v>

2119
00:53:55.381 --> 00:53:57.300
<v Speaker 1>So we're throwing head kicks your way or treat,</v>

2120
00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:00.510
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to stuff it take down your sprawling and trying to turn while</v>

2121
00:54:00.511 --> 00:54:02.070
<v Speaker 1>someone's driving towards you.</v>

2122
00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:04.590
<v Speaker 1>That's why a few of the body that's prone to injury,</v>

2123
00:54:04.591 --> 00:54:05.241
<v Speaker 1>especially we've had,</v>

2124
00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:05.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2125
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:08.820
<v Speaker 1>if you've wrestled your whole life and it starts to build up like it came,</v>

2126
00:54:08.821 --> 00:54:09.290
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2127
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:10.850
<v Speaker 1>the motherfucking stay healthy for not,</v>

2128
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:12.180
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what was going to say,</v>

2129
00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.860
<v Speaker 1>but I think number Grumet off,</v>

2130
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:14.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not a coincidence.</v>

2131
00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:16.170
<v Speaker 1>They're all in the same camp,</v>

2132
00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:16.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2133
00:54:16.771 --> 00:54:18.120
<v Speaker 1>and it's also not a coincidence.</v>

2134
00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:23.121
<v Speaker 1>They have at least the three champions out of that fucking gym and to current,</v>

2135
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean the j Aka is a monster house.</v>

2136
00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a monster house,</v>

2137
00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:31.020
<v Speaker 1>but they're also getting guys with a lot of miles on like dcs miles.</v>

2138
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Kane has some motherfucking miles.</v>

2139
00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Naga Madoff has crazy miles.</v>

2140
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:37.620
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] got a nice sweet odometer though,</v>

2141
00:54:37.621 --> 00:54:38.454
<v Speaker 1>Baby.</v>

2142
00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:39.413
<v Speaker 1>We'll take him off.</v>

2143
00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:41.400
<v Speaker 1>He's the new,</v>

2144
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Tessa is a Tesla and Prius,</v>

2145
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:45.503
<v Speaker 1>but he's not a,</v>

2146
00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:47.723
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

2147
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:48.870
<v Speaker 1>he's the newest thing.</v>

2148
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:53.640
<v Speaker 1>He's like a dope mach one Mustang and he came back on top.</v>

2149
00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:54.331
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2150
00:54:54.331 --> 00:54:56.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that a guy like him is the future,</v>

2151
00:54:56.650 --> 00:54:57.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2152
00:54:57.930 --> 00:55:01.230
<v Speaker 1>especially like he's in that division.</v>

2153
00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:03.480
<v Speaker 1>He's so unusual because he's a wrestler.</v>

2154
00:55:03.481 --> 00:55:04.980
<v Speaker 1>He's got really good Jujitsu,</v>

2155
00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:06.000
<v Speaker 1>his top games,</v>

2156
00:55:06.001 --> 00:55:06.780
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

2157
00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:07.620
<v Speaker 1>He's tall,</v>

2158
00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:08.520
<v Speaker 1>he kicks Harvey.</v>

2159
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:12.360
<v Speaker 1>He's got a good balance between being strong and being long.</v>

2160
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Like some long guys.</v>

2161
00:55:13.831 --> 00:55:14.700
<v Speaker 1>They just not as strong.</v>

2162
00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Anderson was always a long guy,</v>

2163
00:55:17.431 --> 00:55:18.690
<v Speaker 1>but not a strong guy.</v>

2164
00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:19.441
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2165
00:55:19.441 --> 00:55:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Like Anderson's never man held the handle anybody the way Rockhold can manhandle</v>

2166
00:55:23.371 --> 00:55:25.710
<v Speaker 1>you will see what he did to Yaddo the,</v>

2167
00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:26.850
<v Speaker 1>even when he gets them on the ground,</v>

2168
00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.890
<v Speaker 1>those long guys are strong like that.</v>

2169
00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones is.</v>

2170
00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:33.060
<v Speaker 1>People say how long he is.</v>

2171
00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:35.880
<v Speaker 1>You get in the clinch with him and I've wrestled with John.</v>

2172
00:55:35.881 --> 00:55:36.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2173
00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:40.440
<v Speaker 1>what the flip plan is this from the fuck you could totally see.</v>

2174
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:43.860
<v Speaker 1>You could totally say you're saying when when DC was fighting him and he took DC</v>

2175
00:55:43.861 --> 00:55:44.581
<v Speaker 1>down that first round,</v>

2176
00:55:44.581 --> 00:55:45.150
<v Speaker 1>DC was like,</v>

2177
00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:45.540
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2178
00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:46.373
<v Speaker 1>these faces like,</v>

2179
00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:47.041
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck.</v>

2180
00:55:47.041 --> 00:55:47.874
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

2181
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2182
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:48.601
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2183
00:55:48.601 --> 00:55:49.434
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2184
00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:51.270
<v Speaker 1>he's strong as fuck.</v>

2185
00:55:51.271 --> 00:55:52.560
<v Speaker 1>He threw me across the room on time.</v>

2186
00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.120
<v Speaker 1>She's the one that I've hung out with.</v>

2187
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:54.953
<v Speaker 1>John.</v>

2188
00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2189
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.310
<v Speaker 1>I haven't hung out with John since John threw me across the face.</v>

2190
00:55:58.920 --> 00:55:59.371
<v Speaker 1>You know me.</v>

2191
00:55:59.371 --> 00:56:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm the number one fan of John by love.</v>

2192
00:56:00.901 --> 00:56:01.441
<v Speaker 1>How everyone's like,</v>

2193
00:56:01.441 --> 00:56:01.591
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2194
00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:02.610
<v Speaker 1>he's changed.</v>

2195
00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:03.211
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2196
00:56:03.211 --> 00:56:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Because on Instagram he's posting videos of working out and shit splits by the</v>

2197
00:56:06.811 --> 00:56:11.190
<v Speaker 1>narrative Mr Shop and he's the baddest motherfucker on the planet and he's swole</v>

2198
00:56:11.191 --> 00:56:11.550
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2199
00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:11.731
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2200
00:56:11.731 --> 00:56:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Like beating that dude.</v>

2201
00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:13.741
<v Speaker 1>Fuck me.</v>

2202
00:56:13.741 --> 00:56:14.700
<v Speaker 1>That's all I'm buying.</v>

2203
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2204
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:16.820
<v Speaker 1>What was that seven men he was taking?</v>

2205
00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:17.700
<v Speaker 1>I really want that.</v>

2206
00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:19.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2207
00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2208
00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:20.673
<v Speaker 1>It's good stuff.</v>

2209
00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Many magazine coming.</v>

2210
00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:22.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2211
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.900
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2212
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:25.900
<v Speaker 1>no Bermudez versus Caligiuri.</v>

2213
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:26.783
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2214
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:28.600
<v Speaker 1>I see a very good fight.</v>

2215
00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Caligiuri was a motherfucker in Japan,</v>

2216
00:56:30.911 --> 00:56:31.410
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2217
00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:32.243
<v Speaker 1>A legend.</v>

2218
00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2219
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.500
<v Speaker 1>Remember Bermudez was on I think a similar fight.</v>

2220
00:56:35.501 --> 00:56:36.334
<v Speaker 1>Win Streak.</v>

2221
00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2222
00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Caligiuri has had some tough fights in MMA period because the,</v>

2223
00:56:40.531 --> 00:56:44.860
<v Speaker 1>the first big one he had was with Melendez and it was back when Zuka had</v>

2224
00:56:44.861 --> 00:56:47.320
<v Speaker 1>purchased Strikeforce and they reinstated elbows.</v>

2225
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.153
<v Speaker 1>You remember that?</v>

2226
00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:48.731
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2227
00:56:48.731 --> 00:56:49.520
<v Speaker 1>you got fucked up.</v>

2228
00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Gilbert took it down and it was the first time that Gilbert there.</v>

2229
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Strikeforce career.</v>

2230
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2231
00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2232
00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:55.150
<v Speaker 1>I was there.</v>

2233
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:55.571
<v Speaker 1>Ringside.</v>

2234
00:56:55.571 --> 00:56:56.231
<v Speaker 1>Was that where it was?</v>

2235
00:56:56.231 --> 00:56:56.980
<v Speaker 1>San Diego.</v>

2236
00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:58.270
<v Speaker 1>It was the first time,</v>

2237
00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:02.470
<v Speaker 1>I think in strike force where they allowed elbows on the ground because when</v>

2238
00:57:02.471 --> 00:57:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Gilbert had been fighting before,</v>

2239
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:04.990
<v Speaker 1>even though he's a wrestler,</v>

2240
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:06.550
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't use elbows on the ground.</v>

2241
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:08.320
<v Speaker 1>They had like a pride,</v>

2242
00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:10.990
<v Speaker 1>a similar rule set before the UFC.</v>

2243
00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:11.831
<v Speaker 1>Was that San Diego?</v>

2244
00:57:11.831 --> 00:57:12.664
<v Speaker 1>San Jose?</v>

2245
00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

2246
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:14.343
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

2247
00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:15.640
<v Speaker 1>I watched it on TV.</v>

2248
00:57:15.641 --> 00:57:18.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it was awesome.</v>

2249
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:18.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2250
00:57:18.851 --> 00:57:19.750
<v Speaker 1>San Diego was it,</v>

2251
00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:23.440
<v Speaker 1>do you realize how important elbows are on the game changer?</v>

2252
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:26.950
<v Speaker 1>And we guys fought their whole career without elbows and then all of a sudden</v>

2253
00:57:26.951 --> 00:57:27.784
<v Speaker 1>they use elbows.</v>

2254
00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:29.920
<v Speaker 1>They get more for like a guy like Gilbert,</v>

2255
00:57:29.921 --> 00:57:32.440
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge weapon for him because his wrestling so good.</v>

2256
00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:33.071
<v Speaker 1>He's so strong.</v>

2257
00:57:33.071 --> 00:57:34.690
<v Speaker 1>He's on toppy smashing it with elbows.</v>

2258
00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.770
<v Speaker 1>It's way better than punching you.</v>

2259
00:57:35.771 --> 00:57:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2260
00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:38.980
<v Speaker 1>And so like it goes from that to,</v>

2261
00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:39.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2262
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:40.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2263
00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:41.170
<v Speaker 1>he had a,</v>

2264
00:57:41.171 --> 00:57:43.210
<v Speaker 1>a couple tough fights after that and it just,</v>

2265
00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:44.341
<v Speaker 1>when you have a,</v>

2266
00:57:44.341 --> 00:57:46.900
<v Speaker 1>a beat down like that Gilbert Melendez fight,</v>

2267
00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.400
<v Speaker 1>look at junior dos Santos.</v>

2268
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2269
00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Well it's never the same.</v>

2270
00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2271
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:51.010

2272
00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:51.131
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2273
00:57:51.131 --> 00:57:51.581
<v Speaker 1>he's fighting.</v>

2274
00:57:51.581 --> 00:57:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Rothwell did the heavyweight.</v>

2275
00:57:53.711 --> 00:57:53.951
<v Speaker 1>Tufts.</v>

2276

<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking fights.</v>

2277
00:57:54.881 --> 00:57:57.940
<v Speaker 1>We haven't talked on our last ski Overeem's train the same camp.</v>

2278
00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:00.100
<v Speaker 1>These motherfuckers said now neither of us are going anywhere.</v>

2279
00:58:00.101 --> 00:58:01.900
<v Speaker 1>We're going to treat it the same camp and fight each other.</v>

2280
00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2281
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:03.010

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:03.970
<v Speaker 1>terrible idea of fellas,</v>

2283
00:58:03.971 --> 00:58:05.590
<v Speaker 1>but I guess she was coming at different times.</v>

2284
00:58:05.591 --> 00:58:06.750
<v Speaker 1>How do they work that?</v>

2285
00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:07.511
<v Speaker 1>How do you gain planet?</v>

2286
00:58:07.511 --> 00:58:11.470
<v Speaker 1>How's Greg Jackson and game plan that you got a game plan to draw?</v>

2287
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:11.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2288
00:58:11.831 --> 00:58:12.400
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

2289
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Do you like each car?</v>

2290
00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Does each guy have like one member of the crew?</v>

2291
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.240
<v Speaker 1>He takes us as corner guy partners.</v>

2292
00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:18.731
<v Speaker 1>How's it work?</v>

2293
00:58:18.731 --> 00:58:19.564
<v Speaker 1>Training partners,</v>

2294
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:21.100
<v Speaker 1>especially heavyweights at Jackson.</v>

2295
00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

2296
00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:22.473
<v Speaker 1>You're all kind of a,</v>

2297
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:26.710
<v Speaker 1>what if they sparred like every day leading up to it,</v>

2298
00:58:26.711 --> 00:58:29.080
<v Speaker 1>whether they sparred to help each other get sharp,</v>

2299
00:58:29.081 --> 00:58:29.914
<v Speaker 1>to fight each other.</v>

2300
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:30.993
<v Speaker 1>It'd be brilliant.</v>

2301
00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:32.830
<v Speaker 1>The nerves wouldn't be there as much.</v>

2302
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:34.091
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2303
00:58:34.091 --> 00:58:34.750
<v Speaker 1>but who would,</v>

2304
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:36.010
<v Speaker 1>who would say yes to that?</v>

<v Speaker 1>the hero hooks up with this site piece hit the edge of the seats.</v>

2482
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

2483
01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:39.140
<v Speaker 1>One of the greatest documentaries.</v>

2484
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:39.983
<v Speaker 1>That's all</v>

2485
01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I give it a four out of five.</v>

01:02:50.071 --> 01:02:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2492
01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Let's pick it.</v>

2493
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.433
<v Speaker 1>That was just about</v>

2494
01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:54.693
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

2495
01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.090
<v Speaker 1>data and Kimbo.</v>

2496
01:03:00.091 --> 01:03:00.924
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>

2497
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.381
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2498
01:03:01.381 --> 01:03:01.951
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>

2499
01:03:01.951 --> 01:03:05.100
<v Speaker 1>that was like they should have called it a special street match or something.</v>

2500
01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:06.680
<v Speaker 1>That's a strong no for me.</v>

2501
01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:07.021
<v Speaker 1>You said,</v>

2502
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:07.201
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2503
01:03:07.201 --> 01:03:10.050
<v Speaker 1>we're going to show this for pure entertainment value.</v>

2504
01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:10.831
<v Speaker 1>Everyone last night,</v>

2505
01:03:10.831 --> 01:03:11.311
<v Speaker 1>MMA,</v>

2506
01:03:11.311 --> 01:03:12.750
<v Speaker 1>it's just two dudes.</v>

2507
01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Just Bro.</v>

2508
01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:13.920
<v Speaker 1>I say you do.</v>

2509
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I think you put Datta and Kimbo and let Justin wren fight both at the same time.</v>

2510
01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:20.190
<v Speaker 1>If they're going to do shit shows,</v>

2511
01:03:20.191 --> 01:03:20.910
<v Speaker 1>let's get real.</v>

2512
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they thought that was going to be as bad as it was.</v>

2513
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:23.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2514
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.080
<v Speaker 1>they thought Kim was get knocked down on the first round.</v>

2515
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody anticipated those guys.</v>

2516
01:03:28.411 --> 01:03:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Would gas like that,</v>

2517
01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:32.360
<v Speaker 1>like that was the worst gassing and the history of gas.</v>

2518
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:33.870
<v Speaker 1>If you train some adjustments,</v>

2519
01:03:33.871 --> 01:03:36.530
<v Speaker 1>pygmies they can be pretty bad in Denver.</v>

2520
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.140
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of a excuse because they were fighting and they have better</v>

2521
01:03:40.141 --> 01:03:41.220
<v Speaker 1>technique at least.</v>

2522
01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:41.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2523
01:03:41.411 --> 01:03:42.930
<v Speaker 1>There were there to really high level.</v>

2524
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:44.660
<v Speaker 1>These were all over the place,</v>

2525
01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:46.680
<v Speaker 1>swung some bombs,</v>

2526
01:03:46.681 --> 01:03:50.730
<v Speaker 1>but he just had a real hero in the early parts of the round before Kimbo took</v>

2527
01:03:50.731 --> 01:03:51.390
<v Speaker 1>him down.</v>

2528
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:54.630
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't have enough gas Bermudez guys back here.</v>

2529
01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.280
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't have any gas,</v>

2530
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.611
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2531
01:03:56.611 --> 01:03:56.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2532
01:03:56.881 --> 01:03:58.290
<v Speaker 1>who knows how he's really training.</v>

2533
01:03:59.010 --> 01:03:59.251
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2534
01:03:59.251 --> 01:04:00.990
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest that he might like it.</v>

2535
01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:02.580
<v Speaker 1>He's just not very good.</v>

2536
01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2537
01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2538
01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:04.351
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2539
01:04:04.351 --> 01:04:05.610
<v Speaker 1>that's never been what he's doing,</v>

2540
01:04:05.611 --> 01:04:05.791
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2541
01:04:05.791 --> 01:04:07.140
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing these street fights.</v>

2542
01:04:07.141 --> 01:04:08.100
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's been doing,</v>

2543
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.240
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2544
01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:09.961
<v Speaker 1>Get your paper,</v>

2545
01:04:09.961 --> 01:04:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Doug.</v>

2546
01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:10.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2547
01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:13.860
<v Speaker 1>I kind of get that he wants to fight and fight legitimate and I kind of get that</v>

2548
01:04:13.861 --> 01:04:15.210
<v Speaker 1>he's got to take that paycheck,</v>

2549
01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:20.190
<v Speaker 1>but I just wish he had like a real strength and conditioning coach or a real</v>

2550
01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:24.300
<v Speaker 1>trainer come down to 5,000 by hiring this real strength conditioning coach.</v>

2551
01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:25.350
<v Speaker 1>She didn't get that haircut.</v>

2552
01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:29.070
<v Speaker 1>You don't get that warrior here talking about him.</v>

2553
01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:29.963
<v Speaker 1>He got that.</v>

2554
01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:30.841
<v Speaker 1>He made some money.</v>

2555
01:04:30.841 --> 01:04:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he made some money.</v>

2556
01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:32.910
<v Speaker 1>That's all he cares about.</v>

2557
01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:35.850
<v Speaker 1>I think if you could find the backyard just same amount of amount of money.</v>

2558
01:04:35.851 --> 01:04:36.684
<v Speaker 1>He's doing it.</v>

2559
01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:37.650
<v Speaker 1>I just wonder,</v>

2560
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:37.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2561
01:04:37.921 --> 01:04:40.890
<v Speaker 1>you take a guy like that and you bring them to a legit place.</v>

2562
01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:41.970
<v Speaker 1>How much did you make?</v>

2563
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:42.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2564
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I kind of think you made some good money though.</v>

2565
01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:47.900
<v Speaker 1>But if you took a guy like that and you brought him to a Greg Jackson is not</v>

2566
01:04:47.901 --> 01:04:48.750
<v Speaker 1>going to be a fun story.</v>

2567
01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:50.573
<v Speaker 1>Mark Henry,</v>

2568
01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:51.370
<v Speaker 1>you don't think so?</v>

2569
01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2570
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.190
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking wrecked.</v>

2571
01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just changes his attitude.</v>

2572
01:04:54.721 --> 01:04:55.970
<v Speaker 1>He gets ate up plates,</v>

2573
01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:56.813
<v Speaker 1>Car Yashi.</v>

2574
01:04:56.830 --> 01:04:59.280
<v Speaker 1>That motherfucker gets toward the fuck.</v>

2575
01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:00.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2576
01:05:00.061 --> 01:05:01.350
<v Speaker 1>but maybe he learns,</v>

2577
01:05:01.351 --> 01:05:02.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe learns how to fight.</v>

2578
01:05:02.341 --> 01:05:06.030
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about him going in there and sparring with an in Prime Shane</v>

2581
01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Are you talking about the Brenden's shop program ready?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Fancy dishes like,</v>

2639
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:26.410

2640
01:06:26.411 --> 01:06:28.380
<v Speaker 3>if you get too close to the spine,</v>

2641
01:06:28.410 --> 01:06:30.180
<v Speaker 3>we can't go 12 to six on the spine.</v>

2642
01:06:30.270 --> 01:06:31.290
<v Speaker 3>You can't go 12 to six anywhere.</v>

2643
01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:32.250
<v Speaker 3>Even on the thighs.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They warn you about that.</v>

2645
01:06:33.450 --> 01:06:34.340
<v Speaker 3>But it's weird to that.</v>

2646
01:06:34.341 --> 01:06:34.870
<v Speaker 3>His mission,</v>

2647
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:35.500
<v Speaker 3>because you can,</v>

2648
01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:36.690
<v Speaker 3>if you're on the bottom like guard.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2650
01:06:37.201 --> 01:06:39.840
<v Speaker 3>but it's not because it's going six to 12.</v>

2651
01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:42.360
<v Speaker 3>Because you're from the bottom.</v>

2652
01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:44.250
<v Speaker 3>This motion instead of this one.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking stupid.</v>

2658
01:06:53.881 --> 01:06:56.880
<v Speaker 3>It's very rare when you're trying to live it up.</v>

2659
01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:57.750
<v Speaker 3>I guess you'd do it.</v>

2691
01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.550
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that maybe they feel painted a different way?</v>

<v Speaker 3>endorphins?</v>

2694
01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:55.720
<v Speaker 3>I've always wondered that because you know people talk about like pain</v>

2695
01:07:55.721 --> 01:07:56.530
<v Speaker 3>tolerance,</v>

<v Speaker 3>What are they feeling or we assume,</v>

2701
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.240
<v Speaker 3>I assume that when someone does something to you,</v>

2702
01:08:07.241 --> 01:08:09.070
<v Speaker 3>it feels the same as it is to me,</v>

2703
01:08:09.071 --> 01:08:10.150
<v Speaker 3>but it's clearly different.</v>

2704
01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:11.080
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

2705

<v Speaker 1>But the way Dennis was countering was so much more powerful than what cow was.</v>

2882
01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

2883
01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying on the first one,</v>

2884
01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:27.271
<v Speaker 1>devil's advocate.</v>

2885
01:12:27.271 --> 01:12:27.500
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2886
01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:28.470
<v Speaker 1>that's why I brought it up.</v>

2887
01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Pushing him.</v>

2888
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:31.360
<v Speaker 1>He's getting fucked up the first round.</v>

2889
01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Who you give that to the first round couch,</v>

2890
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:36.420
<v Speaker 1>even though he didn't get the successful take down.</v>

2891
01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I see it as,</v>

2892
01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:38.611
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2893
01:12:38.611 --> 01:12:39.870
<v Speaker 1>he's pushing forward.</v>

2894
01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:42.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not effective and the reason he's pushing forward,</v>

2895
01:12:42.331 --> 01:12:43.164
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want nothing.</v>

2896
01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:44.250
<v Speaker 1>None of the standup,</v>

2897
01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:45.000
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

2898
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.260
<v Speaker 1>even when he's pushing forward though,</v>

2899
01:12:46.261 --> 01:12:47.460
<v Speaker 1>he was underneath,</v>

2900
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:48.990
<v Speaker 1>he was underneath the leg.</v>

2901
01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.550
<v Speaker 1>He had his arm tied up like this.</v>

2902
01:12:50.551 --> 01:12:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Like see how Bermuda's loves to tie that,</v>

2903
01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:55.670
<v Speaker 1>that wrist up on inspiring Sanderson's all Ryan Parson,</v>

2904
01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:57.510
<v Speaker 1>he is just beating the shit out of him here.</v>

2905
01:12:57.511 --> 01:13:00.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a number of unanswered shots.</v>

2906
01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:00.901
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2907
01:13:00.901 --> 01:13:01.734
<v Speaker 1>twister.</v>

2908
01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:02.693
<v Speaker 1>That'd be sick.</v>

2909
01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:03.510
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to happen.</v>

2910
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:04.690
<v Speaker 1>What I'm trying to go,</v>

2911
01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:06.900
<v Speaker 1>he wants to,</v>

2912
01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:07.231
<v Speaker 1>what does he do?</v>

2913
01:13:07.231 --> 01:13:08.130
<v Speaker 1>He just wants to take the back.</v>

2914
01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:12.500
<v Speaker 1>He's got his bags on a flat amount per municipal.</v>

2915
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

2916
01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:17.130
<v Speaker 1>How would you beat gummy or now go me beat him in a PR and provide,</v>

2917
01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:17.490
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2918
01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:18.390
<v Speaker 1>That's how that was soccer.</v>

2919
01:13:18.391 --> 01:13:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I do soccer.</v>

2920
01:13:19.321 --> 01:13:19.860
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2921
01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:20.111
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2922
01:13:20.111 --> 01:13:20.944
<v Speaker 1>I what I'm thinking of</v>

2923
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.810
<v Speaker 1>how you got those screaming at me screaming at him.</v>

2924
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2925
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Parsons.</v>

2926
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:26.760
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2927
01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.300
<v Speaker 1>he's all about control and him and Pat Carnes smart.</v>

2928
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:31.470
<v Speaker 1>That's all he does spend.</v>

2929
01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:31.621
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2930
01:13:31.621 --> 01:13:34.740
<v Speaker 1>especially from those positions you see like as he's moving in for that shot,</v>

2931
01:13:34.741 --> 01:13:36.180
<v Speaker 1>controlling that right wrist,</v>

2932
01:13:36.450 --> 01:13:38.880
<v Speaker 1>he was able to land so many hard shots.</v>

2933
01:13:39.130 --> 01:13:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Just so much control how many hard elbows that he land from that position.</v>

2934
01:13:42.421 --> 01:13:43.800
<v Speaker 1>It had to be like 10 right?</v>

2935
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.830
<v Speaker 1>At least at least 10 hard ones.</v>

2936
01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.040
<v Speaker 1>So when you think about that,</v>

2937
01:13:48.041 --> 01:13:51.180
<v Speaker 1>like just the impact of that as he goes back to his round,</v>

2938
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:53.970
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely diminished from that big time.</v>

2939
01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:55.650
<v Speaker 1>It was a bad scene.</v>

2940
01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:55.971
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2941
01:13:55.971 --> 01:13:56.801
<v Speaker 1>we'd have whatever man.</v>

2942
01:13:56.801 --> 01:13:57.151
<v Speaker 1>Go in there,</v>

2943
01:13:57.151 --> 01:13:57.930
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

2944
01:13:57.930 --> 01:13:58.171
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2945
01:13:58.171 --> 01:13:58.321
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2946
01:13:58.321 --> 01:13:58.681
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

2947
01:13:58.681 --> 01:13:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

2948
01:13:59.060 --> 01:13:59.460
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

2949
01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll take one fucking baby.</v>

2950
01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2951
01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.080
<v Speaker 1>I have a big celebration to celebrate.</v>

2952
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:06.750
<v Speaker 1>It's as a celebration bitches</v>

2953
01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:10.140
<v Speaker 1>like Jamie can drink.</v>

2954
01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:11.093
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this,</v>

2955
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

2956
01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.273
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>

2957
01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:17.530
<v Speaker 3>if you're a cowboy Hornimann and the fights five or five rounds,</v>

2958
01:14:17.531 --> 01:14:18.041
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying,</v>

2959
01:14:18.041 --> 01:14:18.550
<v Speaker 3>Joe?</v>

2960
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:19.570
<v Speaker 3>The fights five rounds,</v>

2961
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:22.240
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to have a game plan for five rounds,</v>

2962
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.600
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2963
01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.490
<v Speaker 3>You're going to say that the first round,</v>

2964
01:14:24.491 --> 01:14:24.941
<v Speaker 3>give it hell,</v>

2965
01:14:24.941 --> 01:14:25.181
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2966
01:14:25.181 --> 01:14:26.380
<v Speaker 3>Then after that it's whatever.</v>

2967
01:14:26.410 --> 01:14:28.900
<v Speaker 3>I would assume they would try to do that because that's where cowboys had</v>

2968
01:14:28.901 --> 01:14:29.950
<v Speaker 3>problems in the past.</v>

2969
01:14:29.951 --> 01:14:33.300
<v Speaker 3>Guys jump on him and he's taking the fight on short doughnut cowboy given into</v>

2970
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:34.630
<v Speaker 3>rhythm cause he's gonna fuck you up.</v>

2971
01:14:34.631 --> 01:14:35.680
<v Speaker 3>You blitz ass.</v>

2972
01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:38.080
<v Speaker 3>How many weeks it Olivera have to prepare weeks.</v>

2973
01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:40.610
<v Speaker 3>He just fought not too long ago though.</v>

2974
01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:41.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh well there you go.</v>

2975
01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:42.723
<v Speaker 3>That could be,</v>

2976
01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:44.650
<v Speaker 3>that could be still five round fight.</v>

2977
01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:49.470
<v Speaker 3>You don't give a fuck who you is still going on Caligiuri and Nigga,</v>

2978
01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.310
<v Speaker 3>this Bermudez is attacking now.</v>

2979
01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:53.950
<v Speaker 3>Can I get one of the other ones?</v>

2980
01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:54.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah Dude.</v>

2981
01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.500
<v Speaker 3>How bad ass was at Jeremy's Guinness.</v>

2982
01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Melcher I liked that stuff relating to get us your,</v>

2983
01:14:59.730 --> 01:15:00.880
<v Speaker 3>that's a grown ass man drink.</v>

2984
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:02.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm not ready for it even though I'm a dad now.</v>

2985
01:15:03.010 --> 01:15:05.440
<v Speaker 3>This is probably bad for my low carbohydrate diet.</v>

2986
01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:06.393
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2987

3011
01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:38.520
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of,</v>

3012
01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.850
<v Speaker 3>that's the most important thing that we'll watch.</v>

3013
01:15:39.851 --> 01:15:40.671
<v Speaker 3>16 and pregnant.</v>

3014

<v Speaker 3>it's not hard.</v>

3019
01:15:45.521 --> 01:15:46.600
<v Speaker 3>Don't let those be your role model.</v>

3020
01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.260
<v Speaker 3>That's the standard.</v>

3021
01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:53.580
<v Speaker 3>You can read books side of it.</v>

3050
01:16:27.071 --> 01:16:29.950
<v Speaker 3>but it makes a lot of people better person because they'd become way more</v>

3051
01:16:29.951 --> 01:16:33.370
<v Speaker 3>considerate and they start looking at the world differently cause you kind of re</v>

3056
01:16:40.210 --> 01:16:41.500
<v Speaker 3>then you start to piece it together and go,</v>

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:41.861
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3058

3229
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:56.110
<v Speaker 5>That's the real problem.</v>

3230
01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:57.360
<v Speaker 5>It's a stupid job.</v>

3231

<v Speaker 5>No one can do.</v>

3232
01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.090
<v Speaker 5>No one should have the job.</v>

3233
01:21:00.330 --> 01:21:01.560
<v Speaker 5>It shouldn't exist anymore.</v>

3234
01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:05.790
<v Speaker 5>It's antiquated and the only way we're going to realize that it's just going to</v>

01:21:05.791 --> 01:21:06.624
<v Speaker 5>be no one running.</v>

3237
01:21:08.371 --> 01:21:09.750
<v Speaker 5>No one's going to run for president.</v>

3238
01:21:09.751 --> 01:21:11.460
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to make a difference at all.</v>

3239
01:21:11.461 --> 01:21:12.600
<v Speaker 5>Some homeless guy and the goat,</v>

01:26:34.641 --> 01:26:35.660
<v Speaker 2>he was just coughing a lot,</v>

3455
01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:37.220
<v Speaker 2>which obviously was in the movie,</v>

3456
01:26:37.330 --> 01:26:39.270
<v Speaker 2>but the most potential a lot.</v>

3457
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:41.750
<v Speaker 2>Fuck his wrestling.</v>

3458
01:26:41.751 --> 01:26:42.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean chuck [inaudible],</v>

3459
01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:44.750
<v Speaker 2>he was the best in his opinion,</v>

3460
01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:47.540
<v Speaker 2>the best wrestler in college history.</v>

3461
01:26:48.010 --> 01:26:49.310
<v Speaker 2>That's what chocolate del said.</v>

3462
01:26:49.410 --> 01:26:51.290
<v Speaker 2>That was his opinion and his opinion.</v>

3463
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:52.960
<v Speaker 2>He was so happy and,</v>

3464
01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:53.481
<v Speaker 2>and I've,</v>

3465
01:26:53.481 --> 01:26:56.270
<v Speaker 2>I've known him for maybe we're not like good friends but known him for 10 years</v>

3466
01:26:56.271 --> 01:26:57.290
<v Speaker 2>and I see him once a year.</v>

3467
01:26:57.290 --> 01:26:59.900
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things you have mutual respect because he's fucking Kevin</v>

3468
01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:04.490
<v Speaker 2>Randleman talking to him and then he's talking about his queen,</v>

3469
01:27:04.491 --> 01:27:05.061
<v Speaker 2>his wife,</v>

3470
01:27:05.061 --> 01:27:06.200
<v Speaker 2>how awesome she was.</v>

3471
01:27:06.201 --> 01:27:09.380
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I met my girlfriend and then he's talking about his four year old</v>

3472
01:27:09.381 --> 01:27:10.214
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>

3473
01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:11.270
<v Speaker 2>What a freak though.</v>

3474
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Athletically they say he's like the best athlete to come through the oil knocked</v>

3475
01:27:14.301 --> 01:27:15.130
<v Speaker 2>out cro cop.</v>

3476
01:27:15.130 --> 01:27:15.711
<v Speaker 2>Ooh Man.</v>

3477
01:27:15.711 --> 01:27:19.570
<v Speaker 2>If he would've caught a lot of left guard and taken back him,</v>

3478
01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:21.410
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine that Kevin Randleman if you would,</v>

3479
01:27:21.411 --> 01:27:23.970
<v Speaker 2>if you even got obsessed and I've had several talks with him,</v>

3480
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.950
<v Speaker 2>say get good at passing the guard and mounting and taken backs.</v>

3481
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:30.050
<v Speaker 2>You'll be unfucking stoppable Jack,</v>

3482
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:34.310
<v Speaker 2>he was the first guy that flat flatline cro cop in pride from across the ring.</v>

3483
01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Super Nice Guy.</v>

3484
01:27:35.991 --> 01:27:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

3485
01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:37.760
<v Speaker 2>speed and power.</v>

3486
01:27:37.761 --> 01:27:38.594
<v Speaker 2>That guy had,</v>

3487
01:27:38.690 --> 01:27:39.770
<v Speaker 2>he was a real nice guy.</v>

3488
01:27:39.771 --> 01:27:40.850
<v Speaker 2>He was fun to be around too.</v>

3489
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:42.400
<v Speaker 2>His real jovial young mark.</v>

3490
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:42.711
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3491
01:27:42.711 --> 01:27:43.544
<v Speaker 2>not a dick.</v>

3492
01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:44.480
<v Speaker 2>So not at all.</v>

3493
01:27:44.481 --> 01:27:44.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3494
01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:46.280
<v Speaker 2>he was never a dick.</v>

3495
01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Bosco from [inaudible] who was talking,</v>

3496
01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:49.970
<v Speaker 2>who was on my podcast this week,</v>

3497
01:27:49.971 --> 01:27:53.060
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about peanut at a hotel elevator with them the day before they</v>

3498
01:27:53.061 --> 01:27:54.710
<v Speaker 2>fought and uh,</v>

3499
01:27:54.711 --> 01:27:57.400
<v Speaker 2>and he said a good luck and uh,</v>

3500
01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Kevin said good luck back to him and Kevin said,</v>

3501
01:28:00.490 --> 01:28:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll make you a deal if you don't kick me.</v>

3502
01:28:02.871 --> 01:28:04.250
<v Speaker 2>I promise to keep this on the feet.</v>

3503
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:05.743
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

3504
01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:06.111
<v Speaker 2>Damn,</v>

3505
01:28:06.111 --> 01:28:06.944
<v Speaker 2>that's nuts.</v>

3506
01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:12.160
<v Speaker 2>And a boss broke it like immediately he said random and started slapping his leg</v>

3507
01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.490
<v Speaker 2>and he felt like he was saying like,</v>

3508
01:28:16.491 --> 01:28:17.870
<v Speaker 2>kicked me and I'll take you down.</v>

3509
01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:18.711
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3510
01:28:18.711 --> 01:28:20.000
<v Speaker 2>like he was trying to figure out what it is.</v>

3511
01:28:20.001 --> 01:28:21.200
<v Speaker 2>So he said yeah.</v>

3512
01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:23.870
<v Speaker 2>And then I fixed to the leg and go with the front kick to the face.</v>

3513
01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:25.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3514
01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.320
<v Speaker 2>And they took them down a lot.</v>

3515
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:31.790
<v Speaker 2>But he's a great guy,</v>

3516
01:28:31.791 --> 01:28:32.180
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3517
01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:35.270
<v Speaker 2>It'd be good to get a CT scan of a random men's brain.</v>

3518
01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:38.270
<v Speaker 2>Cause we don't have a lot of knowledge on that on MMA fighters brains.</v>

3519
01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:38.540
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

3520
01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:39.500
<v Speaker 2>That's a really good point.</v>

3521
01:28:39.501 --> 01:28:41.450
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they were interested in doing that because this,</v>

3522
01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:42.490
<v Speaker 2>his family should,</v>

3523
01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:43.633
<v Speaker 2>is it too late?</v>

3524
01:28:44.050 --> 01:28:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

3525
01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:45.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it works,</v>

3526
01:28:45.381 --> 01:28:46.260
<v Speaker 2>but there's not a lot,</v>

3527
01:28:46.261 --> 01:28:46.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3528
01:28:46.670 --> 01:28:47.660
<v Speaker 2>MMA so young,</v>

3529
01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:49.430
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them don't die and he's a legend.</v>

3530
01:28:49.431 --> 01:28:50.390
<v Speaker 2>He has a lot of fights.</v>

3531
01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:52.540
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be good to get just to see what's going on with,</v>

3532
01:28:52.541 --> 01:28:53.241
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of guys.</v>

3533
01:28:53.241 --> 01:28:56.570
<v Speaker 2>But I wonder if anybody's brought that up because it's hard without being</v>

3534
01:28:56.571 --> 01:29:00.830
<v Speaker 2>disrespectful or perceiving that you are disrespectful saying something like</v>

3535
01:29:00.831 --> 01:29:01.110
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3536
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.840
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

3537
01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's disrespectful?</v>

3538
01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:03.241
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3539
01:29:03.241 --> 01:29:05.030
<v Speaker 2>I definitely don't try to be this.</v>

3540
01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:07.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you are at all because wearing the number saying,</v>

3541
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:09.270
<v Speaker 2>asking that question,</v>

3542
01:29:09.271 --> 01:29:10.104
<v Speaker 2>it would be hard.</v>

3543
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:11.510
<v Speaker 2>Like you know a lot.</v>

3544
01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh you know,</v>

3545
01:29:12.330 --> 01:29:13.200
<v Speaker 2>some people might,</v>

3546
01:29:13.201 --> 01:29:13.411
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3547
01:29:13.411 --> 01:29:16.680
<v Speaker 2>they might have a hard time with their kid just dying or their wife,</v>

3548
01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:18.030
<v Speaker 2>their husband just dying.</v>

3549
01:29:18.210 --> 01:29:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Cause like juniors say out the guy,</v>

3550
01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:23.160
<v Speaker 2>literally my hero growing up as a kid shot himself in the chest.</v>

3551
01:29:23.250 --> 01:29:23.490
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3552
01:29:23.490 --> 01:29:24.900
<v Speaker 2>And the reason he shot himself in the chest.</v>

3553
01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:25.260
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

3554
01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:26.670
<v Speaker 2>you guys need to study my brain,</v>

3555
01:29:26.671 --> 01:29:26.880
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3556
01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:28.020
<v Speaker 2>that's so many concussions.</v>

3557
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:29.910
<v Speaker 2>They just said he wasn't the same guy.</v>

3558
01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:30.803
<v Speaker 2>Did he kill himself?</v>

3559
01:29:30.810 --> 01:29:31.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3560
01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Shoot himself in the chest.</v>

3561
01:29:32.110 --> 01:29:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Commit suicide.</v>

3562
01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:33.733
<v Speaker 2>When was that?</v>

3563
01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:34.321
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>

3564
01:29:34.321 --> 01:29:36.210
<v Speaker 2>four years ago playing junior sal.</v>

3565
01:29:36.330 --> 01:29:36.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3566
01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:37.920
<v Speaker 2>favorite athlete of all time.</v>

3567
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:38.611
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

3568
01:29:38.611 --> 01:29:39.360
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

3569
01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:40.890
<v Speaker 2>They said from so many concussions,</v>

3570
01:29:40.891 --> 01:29:41.760
<v Speaker 2>like his,</v>

3571
01:29:41.850 --> 01:29:43.530
<v Speaker 2>his getaway was the ocean.</v>

3572
01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Like he would get in the ocean.</v>

3573
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:45.061
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3574
01:29:45.061 --> 01:29:46.140
<v Speaker 2>they say he was the happiest guy ever.</v>

3575
01:29:46.141 --> 01:29:46.921
<v Speaker 2>Had a great family,</v>

3576
01:29:46.921 --> 01:29:48.600
<v Speaker 2>lived on the beach and ocean side.</v>

3577
01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:51.870
<v Speaker 2>And then he said all of a sudden something kicked in and he wasn't happy</v>

3578
01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:52.793
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>

3579
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Anywhere.</v>

3580
01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.150
<v Speaker 2>He would fake it everywhere.</v>

3581
01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:55.093
<v Speaker 2>Then he'd go home,</v>

3582
01:29:55.290 --> 01:29:56.160
<v Speaker 2>couldn't sleep.</v>

3583
01:29:56.190 --> 01:29:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Super depressed.</v>

3584
01:29:58.260 --> 01:29:58.950
<v Speaker 2>Bummer Merman.</v>

3585
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:59.783
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

3586
01:29:59.870 --> 01:30:01.270
<v Speaker 2>the NFL has been around for so long.</v>

3587
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:02.143
<v Speaker 2>You need the weed.</v>

3588
01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:03.900
<v Speaker 2>He gave his brain right and they're like,</v>

3589
01:30:03.901 --> 01:30:04.051
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3590
01:30:04.051 --> 01:30:05.520
<v Speaker 2>CT like a motherfucker.</v>

3591
01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:07.800
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not saying round in has anything,</v>

3592
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:10.520
<v Speaker 2>but he's one of the legends with all these fights.</v>

3593
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:11.191
<v Speaker 2>Find Pride,</v>

3594
01:30:11.191 --> 01:30:13.800
<v Speaker 2>UFC who we can actually see what the brain looks like,</v>

3595
01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:16.110
<v Speaker 2>step in the right direction.</v>

3596

3601
01:30:21.570 --> 01:30:25.350
<v Speaker 2>What you're saying is a board that's important to think about and probably would</v>

3602
01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:26.213
<v Speaker 2>been a good idea.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you never know,</v>

3882
01:38:36.121 --> 01:38:36.570
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3883
01:38:36.570 --> 01:38:37.470
<v Speaker 5>He might just decide,</v>

3884
01:38:37.471 --> 01:38:37.771
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3885
01:38:37.771 --> 01:38:40.710
<v Speaker 5>it's time to go on a defensive shell and hit him.</v>

3886
01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:41.430
<v Speaker 5>Dot.</v>

3887
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:42.530
<v Speaker 5>Good luck taking Cody down.</v>

3888
01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:44.630
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

3889
01:38:44.630 --> 01:38:45.181
<v Speaker 5>Hard to take.</v>

3890
01:38:45.181 --> 01:38:46.230
<v Speaker 5>Did he wrestle in high school and Shit?</v>

3891
01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:47.131
<v Speaker 5>That's what I mean.</v>

3892
01:38:47.131 --> 01:38:49.080
<v Speaker 5>I mean the Jujitsu guy would have kind of wrestling.</v>

3893
01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:50.001
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

3894
01:38:50.001 --> 01:38:50.834
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3895
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.360
<v Speaker 5>All his greatest work has been done with the geese,</v>

3896
01:38:54.361 --> 01:38:56.310
<v Speaker 5>so I don't know how it's going to translate.</v>

3897
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.731
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure.</v>

3898
01:38:56.731 --> 01:38:57.810
<v Speaker 5>Where did Cody Russell.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It just in high school,</v>

3900
01:38:59.430 --> 01:39:00.180
<v Speaker 5>but he's real good.</v>

3901
01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:00.481
<v Speaker 5>Really,</v>

3902
01:39:00.481 --> 01:39:01.290
<v Speaker 5>really good.</v>

3903
01:39:01.290 --> 01:39:01.831
<v Speaker 5>And that team,</v>

3904
01:39:01.831 --> 01:39:02.281
<v Speaker 5>Alpha Male,</v>

3905
01:39:02.281 --> 01:39:05.010
<v Speaker 5>they said he's like sets the standard as far as intensity.</v>

3906
01:39:05.011 --> 01:39:06.920
<v Speaker 5>He's a motherfucker while he's,</v>

3907
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.310
<v Speaker 5>he's just there for looks great.</v>

3908
01:39:08.311 --> 01:39:08.700
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3909
01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:09.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3910
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.460
<v Speaker 5>he's definitely got some nasty pounds.</v>

3911
01:39:10.461 --> 01:39:10.861
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>

3912
01:39:10.861 --> 01:39:11.430
<v Speaker 5>He's hurt.</v>

3913
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:13.290
<v Speaker 5>He's hurt any of the gut of his back pocket.</v>

3914
01:39:13.291 --> 01:39:13.940
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

3915
01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:14.790
<v Speaker 5>is that a gun in your pants?</v>

3916
01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:15.071
<v Speaker 5>Dude?</v>

3917
01:39:15.071 --> 01:39:17.070
<v Speaker 5>That's an amazing idea to go with through the way in.</v>

3918
01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:18.690
<v Speaker 5>That's the hardest tramp stamp ever.</v>

3919
01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:21.240
<v Speaker 5>It goes right to his bundle dude,</v>

3920
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.711
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

3921
01:39:28.711 --> 01:39:30.410
<v Speaker 5>So no one knows if he's still with page.</v>

3922
01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:36.670
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3923
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:42.180
<v Speaker 5>let's see how much control you didn't like it.</v>

3924
01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:45.020
<v Speaker 5>Stand up coach,</v>

3925
01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:45.840
<v Speaker 5>get them back to coach.</v>

3926
01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.000
<v Speaker 5>Should not go to the ground with it.</v>

3927
01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:47.581
<v Speaker 5>Hell no,</v>

3928
01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:47.880
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3929
01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:48.713
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3930
01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:50.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he'd probably like that,</v>

3931
01:39:52.230 --> 01:39:56.120
<v Speaker 5>but meanwhile no controls Egypt.</v>

3932
01:39:56.190 --> 01:39:57.930
<v Speaker 5>But I would you have liked to have seen from him.</v>

3933
01:39:57.931 --> 01:39:58.800
<v Speaker 5>And that was ish.</v>

3934
01:39:58.860 --> 01:39:59.880
<v Speaker 5>I don't know man.</v>

3935
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.350
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's time Kino though,</v>

3936
01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:03.580
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3937
01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:04.361
<v Speaker 5>But what would you like,</v>

3938
01:40:04.361 --> 01:40:04.830
<v Speaker 5>like when you,</v>

3939
01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:06.190
<v Speaker 5>when you're seeing the guy was trying to go,</v>

3940
01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:09.600
<v Speaker 5>I think he's not going to be able to take him down and I think he's going to</v>

3941
01:40:09.601 --> 01:40:11.220
<v Speaker 5>lose the fight if he stays on his feet.</v>

3942
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:13.980
<v Speaker 5>So if he can't take him down and you can't,</v>

3943
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.700
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3944
01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:15.480
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3945
01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:16.500
<v Speaker 5>survive on your feet,</v>

3946
01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:17.453
<v Speaker 5>what else is left?</v>

3947
01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:18.210
<v Speaker 5>Jumped to guard.</v>

3948
01:40:18.210 --> 01:40:18.421
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3949
01:40:18.421 --> 01:40:19.570
<v Speaker 5>that's all you have to have.</v>

3950
01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:20.640
<v Speaker 5>Car pulls out</v>

3951
01:40:22.150 --> 01:40:23.090
<v Speaker 5>many times.</v>

3952
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:26.990
<v Speaker 5>Frank Mir fantasy hit no works.</v>

3953
01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:31.170
<v Speaker 5>You're good on your back if you've got fires over Bam.</v>

3954
01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:32.253
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3955
01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:33.370
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>

3956
01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:34.950
<v Speaker 5>I've never really seen him on his back.</v>

3957
01:40:34.951 --> 01:40:35.370
<v Speaker 5>He's the,</v>

3958
01:40:35.370 --> 01:40:36.660
<v Speaker 5>he's the destroyer on top.</v>

3959
01:40:36.661 --> 01:40:38.370
<v Speaker 5>He destroys people going through them on to,</v>

3960
01:40:38.371 --> 01:40:39.600
<v Speaker 5>I bet he's pretty good though,</v>

3961
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:41.730
<v Speaker 5>I bet is just who's better on his back then?</v>

3962
01:40:41.731 --> 01:40:42.361
<v Speaker 5>Cody's is on,</v>

3963
01:40:42.361 --> 01:40:44.370
<v Speaker 5>his standup was not that bad.</v>

3964
01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:45.291
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

3965
01:40:45.291 --> 01:40:47.520
<v Speaker 5>he's definitely a outgunned by Cody,</v>

3966
01:40:47.521 --> 01:40:48.690
<v Speaker 5>but he's moving well,</v>

3967
01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:50.160
<v Speaker 5>he's getting out of the way a shit.</v>

3968
01:40:50.161 --> 01:40:50.790
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3969
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:51.760
<v Speaker 5>he's landed some decent,</v>

3970
01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:53.260
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3971
01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:54.260
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu background</v>

3972
01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:54.640
<v Speaker 1>standups.</v>

3973
01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:55.161
<v Speaker 1>Not Bad at all.</v>

3974
01:40:55.161 --> 01:40:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Not that bad because I see like he's movies.</v>

3975
01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Try to choose that check hook as he stepping back.</v>

3976
01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:02.830
<v Speaker 1>He's not running in a straight line with his hands down.</v>

3977
01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:03.041
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3978
01:41:03.041 --> 01:41:04.020
<v Speaker 1>he's not doing anything dumb.</v>

3979
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.781
<v Speaker 1>Not being reckless,</v>

3980
01:41:04.781 --> 01:41:05.420
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

3981
01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:05.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3982
01:41:05.630 --> 01:41:06.400
<v Speaker 1>save his time.</v>

3983
01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:07.233
<v Speaker 1>He's smart.</v>

3984
01:41:07.330 --> 01:41:08.260
<v Speaker 1>He's very smart.</v>

3985
01:41:08.710 --> 01:41:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that gets that good at Jujitsu,</v>

3986
01:41:11.050 --> 01:41:11.680
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3987
01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:11.991
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3988
01:41:11.991 --> 01:41:15.760
<v Speaker 1>it's when you're hitting that super mastery level where you're beating the best</v>

3989
01:41:15.761 --> 01:41:16.594
<v Speaker 1>guys in the world.</v>

3990
01:41:17.050 --> 01:41:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Well those guys,</v>

3991
01:41:18.130 --> 01:41:21.970
<v Speaker 1>all they have to do is just focus on the new thing and they start picking up the</v>

3992
01:41:21.971 --> 01:41:25.720
<v Speaker 1>new thing with the same sort of clarity that they pick up as long as I only</v>

3993
01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:27.190
<v Speaker 1>physical issues,</v>

3994
01:41:27.730 --> 01:41:30.130
<v Speaker 1>especially Jitsu guys don't there so cerebral,</v>

3995
01:41:30.370 --> 01:41:30.731
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3996
01:41:30.731 --> 01:41:33.250
<v Speaker 1>they're so smart they bring into the octagon.</v>

3997
01:41:33.251 --> 01:41:36.100
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's a difference in the way you move though.</v>

3998
01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:38.560
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is that some guys who are grapplers,</v>

3999
01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:43.480
<v Speaker 1>they never seem to figure out how to develop that explosive snap prompt.</v>

4000
01:41:43.481 --> 01:41:44.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking like you were saying,</v>

4001
01:41:44.381 --> 01:41:46.750
<v Speaker 1>the world class world champions like Jock Caray,</v>

4002
01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Damien Maia,</v>

4003
01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:48.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4004
01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Like those motherfuckers when they bring that same mindset to MMA.</v>

4005
01:41:51.330 --> 01:41:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

4006
01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:53.170
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking nightmare.</v>

4007
01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4008
01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Joc Curry right now.</v>

4009
01:41:55.290 --> 01:41:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Look at that colon cut.</v>

4010
01:41:57.700 --> 01:41:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

4011
01:41:59.490 --> 01:42:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4012
01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.290
<v Speaker 1>It's got some standard.</v>

4013
01:42:01.330 --> 01:42:03.070
<v Speaker 1>It's scary to have someone with that sort of mastery.</v>

4014
01:42:03.071 --> 01:42:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Even you got that good at something.</v>

4015
01:42:05.261 --> 01:42:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit Dry.</v>

4016
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:08.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4017
01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:08.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4018
01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:08.971
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4019
01:42:08.971 --> 01:42:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Stop the fight.</v>

4020
01:42:10.150 --> 01:42:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4021
01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:12.551
<v Speaker 1>hate on that.</v>

4022
01:42:12.551 --> 01:42:13.384
<v Speaker 1>Stop at jetty.</v>

4023
01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:15.093
<v Speaker 1>I hate that shit.</v>

4024
01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:17.433
<v Speaker 1>Break Trauma.</v>

4025
01:42:18.690 --> 01:42:19.920
<v Speaker 1>See Safety,</v>

4026
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:21.461
<v Speaker 1>safety.</v>

4027
01:42:21.461 --> 01:42:22.294
<v Speaker 1>All three</v>

4028
01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:26.250
<v Speaker 1>just got fucked us over.</v>

4029
01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

4030
01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:29.710
<v Speaker 1>That fight was no Eddie.</v>

4031
01:42:31.190 --> 01:42:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

4032
01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:32.313
<v Speaker 1>let's look at it again.</v>

4033
01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Joe Silva did.</v>

4034
01:42:33.850 --> 01:42:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I was happy with it.</v>

4035
01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:35.860
<v Speaker 1>I fell at Cody.</v>

4036
01:42:36.130 --> 01:42:36.963
<v Speaker 1>Cody,</v>

4037
01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:37.813
<v Speaker 1>Cody.</v>

4038
01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Cody would have won,</v>

4039
01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:42.020
<v Speaker 1>but like I was looking at you.</v>

4040
01:42:42.850 --> 01:42:44.290
<v Speaker 1>We want to see a little bit guys.</v>

4041
01:42:44.291 --> 01:42:44.591
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

4042
01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

4043
01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:47.220
<v Speaker 1>we want to see Eddie.</v>

4044
01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:49.213
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4045
01:42:49.490 --> 01:42:50.323
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

4046
01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:52.220
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4047
01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:52.900
<v Speaker 1>he's fine.</v>

4048
01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Not Really Saki in the way.</v>

4049
01:42:55.421 --> 01:42:57.760
<v Speaker 1>That was terrible positioning by Mario Saki.</v>

4050
01:42:57.940 --> 01:42:58.481
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell me.</v>

4051
01:42:58.481 --> 01:42:59.890
<v Speaker 1>That was a good stop it good.</v>

4052
01:43:00.730 --> 01:43:01.121
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4053
01:43:01.121 --> 01:43:02.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a little rough here.</v>

4054
01:43:04.290 --> 01:43:06.470
<v Speaker 1>This is what</v>

4055
01:43:08.130 --> 01:43:09.900
<v Speaker 1>now I'm agreeing with Eddie.</v>

4056
01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4057
01:43:10.570 --> 01:43:11.350
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

4058
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:13.810
<v Speaker 1>the positioning by Mario Yamasaki was terrible.</v>

4059
01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not supposed to do that.</v>

4060
01:43:15.210 --> 01:43:17.950
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to step in between unless you're stopping the fight.</v>

4061
01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Who stepped in between?</v>

4062
01:43:19.661 --> 01:43:23.980
<v Speaker 1>They stepped out like he got in between the action and then he let the action</v>

4063
01:43:23.981 --> 01:43:24.430
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

4064
01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:26.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you guys are only supposed to do that.</v>

4065
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:30.500
<v Speaker 1>That was a moment of indecision or he wanted to get a better look at him and</v>

4066
01:43:30.501 --> 01:43:31.780
<v Speaker 1>that was the only way he could do it.</v>

4067
01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:36.220
<v Speaker 1>But it's a mistake to go between the two fighters because at least in my</v>

4068
01:43:36.221 --> 01:43:36.701
<v Speaker 1>opinion,</v>

4069
01:43:36.701 --> 01:43:38.570
<v Speaker 1>it makes the fight or that the fight stops.</v>

4070
01:43:38.571 --> 01:43:42.070
<v Speaker 1>So it got backs off where you could have landed shots in that time to really,</v>

4071
01:43:42.071 --> 01:43:43.540
<v Speaker 1>and Mario hadn't been in his way.</v>

4072
01:43:43.541 --> 01:43:44.680
<v Speaker 1>I agree 100% I mean,</v>

4073
01:43:44.681 --> 01:43:45.610
<v Speaker 1>he dropped some,</v>

4074
01:43:45.611 --> 01:43:46.210
<v Speaker 1>he's hurt.</v>

4075
01:43:46.210 --> 01:43:47.043
<v Speaker 1>He's on top of him.</v>

4076
01:43:47.050 --> 01:43:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Those couple seconds.</v>

4077
01:43:48.281 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's all you need to get enough clarity to grab a leg or</v>

4078
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.140
<v Speaker 5>just try to scramble back up to your feet or to clinch.</v>

4079
01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:57.860
<v Speaker 5>So that second or so were Mario walks in front of them.</v>

4080
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:59.150
<v Speaker 5>That like interfered.</v>

4081
01:43:59.370 --> 01:43:59.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4082
01:43:59.870 --> 01:44:00.703
<v Speaker 5>Change physician.</v>

4083
01:44:00.730 --> 01:44:01.190
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4084
01:44:01.190 --> 01:44:02.230
<v Speaker 5>Please.</v>

4085
01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:07.190
<v Speaker 5>I heard what he said and then you still know Mario fucked up whether Mario</v>

4086
01:44:07.191 --> 01:44:08.150
<v Speaker 5>jumped in or not.</v>

4087
01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:10.160
<v Speaker 5>Cody is winning that fight right there.</v>

4088
01:44:10.190 --> 01:44:12.830
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he got more head trauma or not fight was over.</v>

4089
01:44:12.831 --> 01:44:14.720
<v Speaker 5>Maybe to understand what the fans want.</v>

4090
01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:17.690
<v Speaker 5>The fans want Dosha out of clothes.</v>

4091
01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:17.910
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

4092
01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:18.920
<v Speaker 5>and I do not give a fuck.</v>

4093
01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:20.510
<v Speaker 5>You don't care about the fans?</v>

4094
01:44:20.530 --> 01:44:20.980
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

4095
01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:22.110
<v Speaker 5>not when it comes to the fat guy.</v>

4096
01:44:22.111 --> 01:44:22.944
<v Speaker 5>Safety.</v>

4097
01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:24.260
<v Speaker 5>His first fight in the UFC,</v>

4098
01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:25.640
<v Speaker 5>he was out on his feet.</v>

4099
01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:27.290
<v Speaker 5>It's all about safety.</v>

4100
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:28.183
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>

4101
01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:29.360
<v Speaker 5>Speaking of head trauma,</v>

4102
01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:31.100
<v Speaker 5>I think Eddie's being passive aggressive,</v>

4103
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:34.281
<v Speaker 5>Mario.</v>

4104
01:44:34.281 --> 01:44:34.521
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

4105
01:44:34.521 --> 01:44:35.780
<v Speaker 5>We got to save their lives.</v>

4106
01:44:35.781 --> 01:44:36.650
<v Speaker 5>The real loser here.</v>

4107
01:44:36.651 --> 01:44:37.340
<v Speaker 5>He really fucked.</v>

4108
01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:37.551
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4109
01:44:37.551 --> 01:44:38.191
<v Speaker 5>how dare you.</v>

4110
01:44:38.191 --> 01:44:38.751
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4111
01:44:38.751 --> 01:44:40.070
<v Speaker 5>If there's a loser in the fire tomorrow,</v>

4112
01:44:40.071 --> 01:44:40.904
<v Speaker 5>you're out there.</v>

4113
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:41.091
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4114
01:44:41.091 --> 01:44:41.421
<v Speaker 5>Mario,</v>

4115
01:44:41.421 --> 01:44:42.230
<v Speaker 5>I love you the heart,</v>

4116
01:44:42.230 --> 01:44:42.591
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

4117
01:44:42.591 --> 01:44:43.071
<v Speaker 5>Brendan.</v>

4118
01:44:43.071 --> 01:44:43.701
<v Speaker 5>You know I love you.</v>

4119
01:44:43.701 --> 01:44:44.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm not trying to talk shit.</v>

4120
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:45.703
<v Speaker 5>I know</v>

4121
01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:50.093
<v Speaker 5>Ian</v>

4122
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:53.060
<v Speaker 5>is super valid.</v>

4123
01:44:54.730 --> 01:44:55.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4124
01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:56.020
<v Speaker 5>we'd love to argue.</v>

4125
01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:57.590
<v Speaker 5>As long as we're clear with that.</v>

4126
01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:02.750
<v Speaker 5>He's always been of the mind that you should let guys take a few more hits on</v>

4127
01:45:02.751 --> 01:45:05.270
<v Speaker 5>the ground rather than a few less.</v>

4128
01:45:05.271 --> 01:45:06.980
<v Speaker 5>That's the majority and I'm saying,</v>

4129
01:45:06.981 --> 01:45:08.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying I've been in there,</v>

4130
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:11.000
<v Speaker 5>you know what I'm saying with that head trauma and I've seen how it affects</v>

4131
01:45:11.001 --> 01:45:12.050
<v Speaker 5>friends and I'm just like,</v>

4132
01:45:12.051 --> 01:45:12.680
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

4133
01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:16.730
<v Speaker 5>I wish you'd stop it a little earlier because the odds are homeboy not going to</v>

4134
01:45:16.731 --> 01:45:17.480
<v Speaker 5>win that fight,</v>

4135
01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:19.190
<v Speaker 5>so might as well stop the fight another day.</v>

4136
01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:22.670
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] Edgar Frankie Edgar bins claiming.</v>

4137
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:23.271
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

4138
01:45:23.271 --> 01:45:24.080
<v Speaker 5>There have been plenty of food.</v>

4139
01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:25.280
<v Speaker 5>I love the exceptions though.</v>

4140
01:45:25.490 --> 01:45:27.910
<v Speaker 5>That's the exception in general.</v>

4141
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:30.710
<v Speaker 5>There would be more of those exceptions if there would've been more referee's</v>

4142
01:45:30.711 --> 01:45:31.370
<v Speaker 5>letting it go.</v>

4143
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:32.240
<v Speaker 5>Like how about Weidman?</v>

4144
01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:32.750
<v Speaker 5>How do we,</v>

4145
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:34.850
<v Speaker 5>maybe Weidman is not the same or junior dos Santos,</v>

4146
01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:38.000
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's not the same and fight without a doubt should have been stopped at</v>

4147
01:45:38.001 --> 01:45:38.450
<v Speaker 5>the end of the day.</v>

4148
01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:41.120
<v Speaker 5>You start a fund like some kind of fun.</v>

4149
01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:43.940
<v Speaker 5>You don't think [inaudible] fight should have been stopped at the end of the</v>

4150
01:45:43.941 --> 01:45:45.200
<v Speaker 5>third mount I,</v>

4151
01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:45.960
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

4152
01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:48.560
<v Speaker 5>I would be lying if I said I didn't like the violence.</v>

4153
01:45:48.590 --> 01:45:49.250
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>

4154
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:51.200
<v Speaker 5>I get get any fucking smashed.</v>

4155
01:45:51.201 --> 01:45:52.430
<v Speaker 5>I like that's the majority.</v>

4156
01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:54.920
<v Speaker 5>People enjoy that because that's what they paid to watch.</v>

4157
01:45:55.050 --> 01:45:58.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying from my point of view as the x fighter,</v>

4158
01:45:58.250 --> 01:45:58.521
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

4159
01:45:58.521 --> 01:45:58.820
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

4160
01:45:58.820 --> 01:45:59.660
<v Speaker 5>let them fight another day.</v>

4161
01:45:59.661 --> 01:46:00.530
<v Speaker 5>He has a long career,</v>

4162
01:46:00.531 --> 01:46:01.010
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4163
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:01.850
<v Speaker 5>Let's just stop it and</v>

4164
01:46:03.710 --> 01:46:05.150
<v Speaker 5>that's why it's so cool when when chuck,</v>

4165
01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:07.233
<v Speaker 5>after he wins,</v>

4166
01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:09.550
<v Speaker 5>he's like a fucking fight into like,</v>

4167
01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:10.131
<v Speaker 5>that's why,</v>

4168
01:46:10.131 --> 01:46:12.590
<v Speaker 5>because it's so dangerous until you could get shut off,</v>

4169
01:46:12.591 --> 01:46:13.820
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't get shut off.</v>

4170
01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:14.653
<v Speaker 5>You got,</v>

4171
01:46:14.930 --> 01:46:15.201
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

4172
01:46:15.201 --> 01:46:15.591
<v Speaker 5>That's great.</v>

4173
01:46:15.591 --> 01:46:16.640
<v Speaker 5>And then 20 years,</v>

4174
01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:18.140
<v Speaker 5>then in 20 years,</v>

4175
01:46:18.141 --> 01:46:18.650
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4176
01:46:18.650 --> 01:46:20.880
<v Speaker 5>Then 20 years you see these boys and they're drooling.</v>

4177
01:46:20.890 --> 01:46:22.460
<v Speaker 5>They don't know where the fuck do I know what they knew.</v>

4178
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:23.570
<v Speaker 5>They know the risk.</v>

4179
01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:24.530
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

4180
01:46:24.530 --> 01:46:24.891
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

4181
01:46:24.891 --> 01:46:26.810
<v Speaker 5>but we can prevent some of it is all I'm saying.</v>

4182
01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:29.240
<v Speaker 5>Prevention Fund.</v>

4183
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:32.600
<v Speaker 5>I like sort of prevention felt like both of your attitudes about this.</v>

4184
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:33.210
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4185
01:46:33.210 --> 01:46:37.250
<v Speaker 5>my attitude right now is I hope that science hit some point where medical</v>

4186
01:46:37.251 --> 01:46:38.930
<v Speaker 5>science fix the brain,</v>

4187
01:46:38.931 --> 01:46:41.120
<v Speaker 5>figure out some way to just revive the brain.</v>

4188
01:46:41.150 --> 01:46:42.050
<v Speaker 5>That'd be so dope.</v>

4189
01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:42.261
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4190
01:46:42.261 --> 01:46:42.891
<v Speaker 5>why can't they,</v>

4191
01:46:42.891 --> 01:46:44.290
<v Speaker 5>if they can do all this different stuff,</v>

4192
01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:44.720
<v Speaker 5>tweaking,</v>

4193
01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:48.320
<v Speaker 5>they can muscle tissue repair and they can fix all kinds of stuff.</v>

4194
01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:51.150
<v Speaker 5>Like who knows what they could do with like maybe one day they're going to be</v>

4195
01:46:51.151 --> 01:46:53.040
<v Speaker 5>able to shoot stem cells in your brain.</v>

4196
01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:53.940
<v Speaker 5>That's the,</v>

4197
01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:54.810
<v Speaker 5>that's the ticket.</v>

4198
01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:55.681
<v Speaker 5>Cause you do that.</v>

4199
01:46:55.681 --> 01:46:56.730
<v Speaker 5>We're all hell yeah.</v>

4200
01:46:56.731 --> 01:47:00.060
<v Speaker 5>Let's go out and we actually got a bunch of letter you'll see is now what</v>

4201
01:47:00.061 --> 01:47:00.690
<v Speaker 5>happens,</v>

4202
01:47:00.690 --> 01:47:01.830
<v Speaker 5>what are the side effects?</v>

4203
01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:05.280
<v Speaker 5>It would be just like you imagine the side effects fucking nightmares every</v>

4204
01:47:05.281 --> 01:47:05.620
<v Speaker 5>night.</v>

4205
01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:06.600
<v Speaker 5>I'll take it.</v>

4206
01:47:08.730 --> 01:47:09.390
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>

4207
01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:11.530
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's going to be like steroids for the brain.</v>

4208
01:47:12.370 --> 01:47:12.961
<v Speaker 5>Like you know,</v>

4209
01:47:12.961 --> 01:47:13.850
<v Speaker 5>you see bodybuilders,</v>

4210
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:15.780
<v Speaker 5>they're fucking ridiculously oversized.</v>

4211
01:47:15.781 --> 01:47:16.440
<v Speaker 5>You going to get people,</v>

4212
01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:17.260
<v Speaker 5>giant bull,</v>

4213
01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:19.290
<v Speaker 5>Mars attacks brains and the brains</v>

4214
01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:23.550
<v Speaker 5>and shit</v>

4215
01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.820
<v Speaker 5>continue to run the world.</v>

4216
01:47:29.850 --> 01:47:30.840
<v Speaker 5>And then everybody's going to say,</v>

4217
01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.550
<v Speaker 5>this fucking juicer is out there.</v>

4218
01:47:32.551 --> 01:47:33.270
<v Speaker 5>One in the world.</v>

4219
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.990
<v Speaker 5>We're going to get bad.</v>

4220
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:35.460
<v Speaker 5>And people are brain juice in</v>

4221
01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:42.870
<v Speaker 5>the elite [inaudible] attacking</v>

4222
01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:46.750
<v Speaker 5>another classic movies.</v>

4223
01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:49.620
<v Speaker 5>So great job science,</v>

4224
01:47:49.621 --> 01:47:51.770
<v Speaker 5>all sorts of science and haters be going well.</v>

4225
01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:53.090
<v Speaker 5>Book Brain,</v>

4226
01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:56.700
<v Speaker 5>your mind Bitch,</v>

4227
01:47:56.701 --> 01:47:57.810
<v Speaker 5>cause he's on steroids</v>

4228
01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:02.250
<v Speaker 5>without steroids.</v>

4229
01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:04.770
<v Speaker 5>Carry read my mind and made me calm.</v>

4230
01:48:07.230 --> 01:48:08.070
<v Speaker 5>He's cheating.</v>

4231
01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:12.060
<v Speaker 5>You know that's like when you see a giant bodybuilder do this.</v>

4232
01:48:12.061 --> 01:48:13.440
<v Speaker 5>The first thing that every guy says,</v>

4233
01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:13.820
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>

4234
01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:16.200
<v Speaker 5>he under committed to that kick.</v>

4235
01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:18.050
<v Speaker 5>He backed off that kid.</v>

4236
01:48:18.051 --> 01:48:18.884
<v Speaker 5>He'd come in,</v>

4237
01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:20.250
<v Speaker 5>he caught him with a beautiful counter.</v>

4238
01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:22.950
<v Speaker 5>Imagine jeopardy where they test for steroids.</v>

4239
01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:27.040
<v Speaker 5>Is this all</v>

4240
01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:31.170
<v Speaker 5>that was?</v>

4241
01:48:31.170 --> 01:48:33.240
<v Speaker 5>That was a big fuck up by Mario.</v>

4242
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:34.890
<v Speaker 5>That's a big fuck up right there.</v>

4243
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4244
01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:36.360
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

4245
01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:37.193
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to die.</v>

4246
01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:38.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to do that job.</v>

4247
01:48:38.490 --> 01:48:40.810
<v Speaker 5>That's sort of the way harder job than doing commentary.</v>

4248
01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:41.693
<v Speaker 5>Commentary.</v>

4249
01:48:41.730 --> 01:48:42.563
<v Speaker 5>Commentary is the,</v>

4250
01:48:42.690 --> 01:48:46.200
<v Speaker 5>my job doing come to is the easiest one of all the jobs in the UFC.</v>

4251
01:48:46.770 --> 01:48:51.200
<v Speaker 5>Slightly just slightly harder than Ariana's job lightly.</v>

4252
01:48:51.710 --> 01:48:54.250
<v Speaker 5>If it's slightly harder than it [inaudible] go away,</v>

4253
01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:55.500
<v Speaker 5>they have to replace you and was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I am doing it.</v>

4256
01:48:59.040 --> 01:48:59.873
<v Speaker 5>We're here.</v>

4257
01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:01.200
<v Speaker 5>We're here in woodland hills,</v>

4258
01:49:01.201 --> 01:49:06.201
<v Speaker 5>partying it up and more people are listening to you talk about margins and Brian</v>

4259
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:09.330
<v Speaker 5>Stann breakdown the fight just the way it is.</v>

4260
01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:10.173
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck</v>

01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:22.330
<v Speaker 5>Juicing.</v>

01:49:22.330 --> 01:49:23.610
<v Speaker 5>He knows Maco removed.</v>

4265
01:49:23.670 --> 01:49:25.170
<v Speaker 5>They put his brain to fish tank.</v>

4266
01:49:25.171 --> 01:49:26.400
<v Speaker 5>He's a fucking juicer.</v>

4267
01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:29.100
<v Speaker 5>He knows he can cook</v>

4268
01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:32.190
<v Speaker 5>pop quizzes.</v>

4269
01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:35.070
<v Speaker 5>He's got like 10 degrees.</v>

4270
01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:36.330

4271
01:49:36.330 --> 01:49:37.740
<v Speaker 5>what's the host of jeopardy?</v>

4272
01:49:37.741 --> 01:49:38.251
<v Speaker 5>What's that guys?</v>

4273
01:49:38.251 --> 01:49:39.900
<v Speaker 5>Now it's true balance Fetzer back.</v>

4274
01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:43.860
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be like Dana White doing press conferences and shit.</v>

4275
01:49:43.861 --> 01:49:47.920
<v Speaker 5>We got the most stringent tests of all game areas.</v>

4276
01:49:50.090 --> 01:49:52.720
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be dudes way smarter than Einstein.</v>

4277
01:49:53.770 --> 01:49:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

4278
01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:55.660
<v Speaker 1>that's going to happen for sure.</v>

4279
01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:56.321
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

4280
01:49:56.321 --> 01:49:57.154
<v Speaker 1>They already have,</v>

4281
01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.950
<v Speaker 1>they already have things like Modafinil,</v>

4282
01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:01.750
<v Speaker 1>which they've outlawed in the Olympics.</v>

4283
01:50:01.751 --> 01:50:04.960
<v Speaker 1>You can't have that in the Olympics anymore and that started out as a smart</v>

4284
01:50:04.961 --> 01:50:05.590
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>

4285
01:50:05.590 --> 01:50:07.030
<v Speaker 1>That was a drug that they created.</v>

4286
01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:08.500
<v Speaker 1>They had to say that they want,</v>

4287
01:50:08.501 --> 01:50:10.720
<v Speaker 1>they've made it for people that have narcolepsy.</v>

4288
01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:11.860
<v Speaker 1>It made me angry.</v>

4289
01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:13.090
<v Speaker 1>They originally didn't,</v>

4290
01:50:13.150 --> 01:50:13.983
<v Speaker 1>they didn't cut.</v>

4291
01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Modafinil makes you angry.</v>

4292
01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

4293
01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I took it for an extended period of,</v>

4294
01:50:17.861 --> 01:50:18.700
<v Speaker 1>because you're so smart,</v>

4295
01:50:18.910 --> 01:50:20.410
<v Speaker 1>you're so smart and you get angry.</v>

4296
01:50:20.411 --> 01:50:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Then how don't,</v>

4297
01:50:23.130 --> 01:50:23.891
<v Speaker 1>here's a funny thing,</v>

4298
01:50:23.891 --> 01:50:24.091
<v Speaker 1>I it,</v>

4299
01:50:24.091 --> 01:50:24.701
<v Speaker 1>you'll like this.</v>

4300
01:50:24.701 --> 01:50:27.400
<v Speaker 1>They came up with it just for performance enhancing reasons.</v>

4301
01:50:27.401 --> 01:50:28.570
<v Speaker 1>It was created for that,</v>

4302
01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:30.820
<v Speaker 1>but then because it's a prescription drug,</v>

4303
01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:33.820
<v Speaker 1>they had to have a reason to prescribe it like an illness.</v>

4304
01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:35.230
<v Speaker 1>That's how drugs are set up.</v>

4305
01:50:35.231 --> 01:50:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't say,</v>

4306
01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:36.970
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4307
01:50:36.970 --> 01:50:38.620
<v Speaker 1>you need a prescription to be more awesome.</v>

4308
01:50:38.650 --> 01:50:40.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take awesome pills and no,</v>

4309
01:50:40.091 --> 01:50:41.110
<v Speaker 1>you have to have something wrong with you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got diagnosed as an awesome.</v>

4312
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:46.020

4313
01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:47.170
<v Speaker 1>you can take modafinil.</v>

01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:51.490
<v Speaker 1>So you have to like say like I'm experiencing fatigue or uh,</v>

4326
01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:09.550
<v Speaker 1>they're all taking modafinil.</v>

01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:26.380

4340
01:51:26.381 --> 01:51:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I knew it was bullshit.</v>

4341
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.911
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sure.</v>

4342
01:51:27.911 --> 01:51:28.810
<v Speaker 1>I just witnessed a crime.</v>

4343
01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Does know how to get him into prescription.</v>

4344
01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:33.940
<v Speaker 1>What it does is it gives you,</v>

4345
01:51:33.941 --> 01:51:35.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't very rarely take it.</v>

4346
01:51:35.231 --> 01:51:36.070
<v Speaker 1>This is what I take it.</v>

4347
01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:36.671
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it.</v>

4348
01:51:36.671 --> 01:51:38.500
<v Speaker 1>If I know I'm tired and I got a,</v>

4349
01:51:38.501 --> 01:51:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I got to drive or if I've got to do something,</v>

4350
01:51:40.690 --> 01:51:41.650
<v Speaker 1>I really want to be sharp.</v>

4351
01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:42.513
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel,</v>

4352
01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:45.220
<v Speaker 1>but I don't take it before podcasts anymore.</v>

4353
01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I've taken it for like four or five.</v>

4354
01:51:47.351 --> 01:51:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Podcast would be the time to take it.</v>

4355
01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:49.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4356
01:51:49.571 --> 01:51:49.841
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4357
01:51:49.841 --> 01:51:50.674
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily.</v>

4358
01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Because sometimes you want a conversation to be,</v>

4359
01:51:54.430 --> 01:51:55.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4360
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.750
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

4361
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:58.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't want it to be too ramped up in,</v>

4362
01:51:58.570 --> 01:51:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean like you gotta know,</v>

4363
01:51:59.890 --> 01:52:01.480
<v Speaker 1>you gotta know like feeling dumb gas.</v>

4364
01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:02.710
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be at their level,</v>

4365
01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:07.000
<v Speaker 1>you want to be able to be casual effortlessly as well as be amped up.</v>

4366
01:52:07.090 --> 01:52:09.700
<v Speaker 1>See I think modafinil is really good if I want to be amped up,</v>

4367
01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:13.000
<v Speaker 1>but I don't necessarily think it would be good if I wanted to be casual.</v>

4368
01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:14.020
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4369
01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:14.491
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's,</v>

4370
01:52:14.491 --> 01:52:17.050
<v Speaker 1>it's to take it like Viagara on the first day you're like,</v>

4371
01:52:17.051 --> 01:52:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fucking dazzle this</v>

4374
01:52:27.371 --> 01:52:28.240
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what it is.</v>

4375
01:52:28.241 --> 01:52:30.550
<v Speaker 6>You're like breaking down fucking molecules.</v>

4376
01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:31.993
<v Speaker 6>Just</v>

4377
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:33.583
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work anymore.</v>

4378

<v Speaker 5>towards getting ready for the invasion battles the same,</v>

4467
01:55:04.881 --> 01:55:06.230
<v Speaker 5>making arrows,</v>

01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:07.913
<v Speaker 5>trying not to die,</v>

<v Speaker 5>trying to live past 25 dude,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You got to,</v>

4472
01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:13.230
<v Speaker 5>when there's like a rugby team of like,</v>

4473
01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:14.870
<v Speaker 5>like a thousand people here,</v>

<v Speaker 5>How the fuck do you got?</v>

4477
01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:22.970
<v Speaker 5>The only way you can convince the guy to do that is you got to make sure he</v>

4478
01:55:22.971 --> 01:55:26.090
<v Speaker 5>believes in Jesus and you gotta make sure he believes in God because you're</v>

4479
01:55:26.091 --> 01:55:26.924
<v Speaker 5>doing it for God.</v>

01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:28.500

01:55:31.041 --> 01:55:31.874

4487
01:55:34.611 --> 01:55:35.210
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

4488
01:55:35.210 --> 01:55:37.220
<v Speaker 5>the only reason they can convince them because they think they're going to</v>

4570
01:58:23.821 --> 01:58:25.560
<v Speaker 5>Because if you get it talking about eternity,</v>

4571
01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:27.090
<v Speaker 5>like you might be a terminal,</v>

4572
01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:29.010

01:58:29.070 --> 01:58:32.580
<v Speaker 5>they're going to say their own swag 20 and so they got like 80 years of life</v>

<v Speaker 5>If they eat vegetables,</v>

01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:45.190
<v Speaker 5>50 and 60 it's like charity work.</v>

01:58:56.710 --> 01:58:57.543
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

4585
01:58:58.820 --> 01:59:03.820
<v Speaker 5>imagine the negotiations are 72 they decided on 72 they knew 50 wouldn't be</v>

4586
01:59:04.481 --> 01:59:04.930
<v Speaker 5>enough.</v>

4587
01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:05.763
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to get any.</v>

4588
01:59:05.810 --> 01:59:08.890
<v Speaker 5>It like the lottery where you take like a little bit every month.</v>

4589
01:59:09.070 --> 01:59:09.903

4592
01:59:15.491 --> 01:59:19.780
<v Speaker 5>You want 100 people in the bombing sat,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was such a Josh Kushner.</v>

4673
02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>So unnecessary man.</v>

4674

4682
02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:13.880

4685
02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:17.780
<v Speaker 1>even though he should have apologized,</v>

4697
02:02:32.421 --> 02:02:33.081
<v Speaker 1>I'm embarrassed,</v>

4698

<v Speaker 1>I'm ashamed it'll never happen again.</v>

4699
02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:36.200
<v Speaker 1>I am so sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I disrespect the sport.</v>

4701
02:02:37.670 --> 02:02:41.300
<v Speaker 1>I fully expected to be fined and suspended for a period of time,</v>

4702
02:02:41.450 --> 02:02:42.950
<v Speaker 1>but I will make reparations and I'm very,</v>

02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:34.760
<v Speaker 1>You know a lot of experience.</v>

4738
02:03:34.970 --> 02:03:36.720
<v Speaker 1>It takes so long to get good at strike.</v>

4739
02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:37.401
<v Speaker 1>Oh look at this.</v>

4740
02:03:37.401 --> 02:03:38.690
<v Speaker 1>He gets you down and you'd be in trouble,</v>

4741
02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:41.600
<v Speaker 1>but you got to get Derek Bronson down there.</v>

4742
02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

4743
02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:43.161
<v Speaker 1>Take down defense.</v>

4744
02:03:43.161 --> 02:03:43.880
<v Speaker 1>She's the show.</v>

4745
02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:45.860
<v Speaker 1>She's got a nasty left kick to,</v>

4746
02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:49.520
<v Speaker 1>he throws it from south port or he can throw it real good off the switch.</v>

4747
02:03:49.670 --> 02:03:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he hit Romero with it off the switch,</v>

4748
02:03:51.771 --> 02:03:55.710
<v Speaker 1>but he was doing oh shot from Brazil.</v>

4749
02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:56.291
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen?</v>

4750
02:03:56.291 --> 02:03:57.390
<v Speaker 1>What kind of control from there?</v>

4753
02:03:59.570 --> 02:04:01.080
<v Speaker 1>but he's kind of like your home against the fence.</v>

4754
02:04:03.380 --> 02:04:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

4757
02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:10.790
<v Speaker 1>what do you have to do to be defensive here?</v>

4758
02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean like got to push them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You got to push them away.</v>

4760
02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:15.053
<v Speaker 1>You got to push them away.</v>

4761
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:18.290
<v Speaker 1>How do you get the rough for you to not stop it?</v>

4762
02:04:18.330 --> 02:04:19.163
<v Speaker 1>You got to</v>

4763
02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:21.273
<v Speaker 1>tell you that,</v>

4764
02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:21.920
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4765
02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:22.221
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4768
02:04:23.941 --> 02:04:24.771
<v Speaker 1>he never went and lived there.</v>

4769
02:04:24.771 --> 02:04:25.400
<v Speaker 1>He was fine.</v>

4770
02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:26.233
<v Speaker 1>He didn't move,</v>

4771
02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:28.060
<v Speaker 1>move jobs,</v>

4772
02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>but he can't move cause he got kicked out of kind of moved and he was trying to</v>

4773
02:04:31.571 --> 02:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>move to garden.</v>

4774
02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:34.580
<v Speaker 1>It's over now to the point.</v>

4775
02:04:34.610 --> 02:04:34.941
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

4776
02:04:34.941 --> 02:04:35.610
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

02:04:35.610 --> 02:04:36.443
<v Speaker 1>That's over now.</v>

4779
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:38.640
<v Speaker 5>through?</v>

4780
02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:40.650
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to do in fighting against that fence.</v>

4781
02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:44.340
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't matter what guard you're playing against the fence.</v>

4782
02:04:44.341 --> 02:04:44.920
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking,</v>

4783
02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:46.740
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to get off the fence.</v>

4784
02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:47.910
<v Speaker 5>You gotta get off the fence.</v>

4785
02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:48.773
<v Speaker 5>No guards.</v>

4786
02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:50.190
<v Speaker 5>You have to work.</v>

4787
02:04:50.250 --> 02:04:50.941
<v Speaker 5>If you're not working,</v>

4788
02:04:50.941 --> 02:04:51.630
<v Speaker 5>they're going to stop it.</v>

4789
02:04:51.630 --> 02:04:52.463
<v Speaker 5>Derek Brunson,</v>

4790
02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:54.000
<v Speaker 5>he needs a break out fight.</v>

4791
02:04:54.001 --> 02:04:54.630
<v Speaker 5>That ain't it.</v>

4792

02:05:01.771 --> 02:05:03.960
<v Speaker 5>at this point his striking never looked better.</v>

4797
02:05:03.961 --> 02:05:04.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's footwork,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You got to put feet on the hips and push people.</v>

4811

<v Speaker 5>he did that a little bit.</v>

4894
02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:03.730
<v Speaker 1>His traps are literally from another planet.</v>

4895
02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:05.230
<v Speaker 1>They start at the top of his head.</v>

4896
02:08:05.410 --> 02:08:07.360
<v Speaker 1>They go all the way down the back of his neck.</v>

4897
02:08:07.670 --> 02:08:08.980
<v Speaker 1>The biggest fucking traps,</v>

4898
02:08:08.981 --> 02:08:10.300
<v Speaker 1>like when you see him,</v>

4907

4908
02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hiring him.</v>

4909
02:08:23.110 --> 02:08:24.220
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about fucking</v>

4910
02:08:26.930 --> 02:08:31.930
<v Speaker 1>still picking Woodley or Joe van cause their fake picture.</v>

4911
02:08:31.961 --> 02:08:32.950

4913
02:08:34.351 --> 02:08:35.620
<v Speaker 1>She's Christ.</v>

4914
02:08:36.130 --> 02:08:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Look at it like the trap to shoulder ratio show over him when he fought last.</v>

4915
02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:41.110
<v Speaker 1>He's on drugs.</v>

4916
02:08:41.530 --> 02:08:41.951
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4917
02:08:41.951 --> 02:08:42.181
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4918
02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:42.970
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4919
02:08:42.970 --> 02:08:43.803
<v Speaker 1>no peptides.</v>

4920
02:08:44.170 --> 02:08:45.003
<v Speaker 1>It's up for,</v>

4921
02:08:46.420 --> 02:08:50.080
<v Speaker 1>he was a freak man dude over him when he fought lesson though was a better body.</v>

4922
02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Well over him when he fought lesson was also a hundred pounds.</v>

4923
02:08:53.790 --> 02:08:56.650
<v Speaker 1>We want to retire then just remember what I just said.</v>

4924
02:08:56.800 --> 02:08:59.530
<v Speaker 1>He's a hundred pounds heavier when he weighed in,</v>

4925
02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:00.750
<v Speaker 1>he gets six</v>

4926
02:09:04.710 --> 02:09:07.510
<v Speaker 1>phone out taking pictures of his ass,</v>

4927
02:09:07.570 --> 02:09:08.620
<v Speaker 1>but he's a hundred pounds heavier.</v>

4928
02:09:08.621 --> 02:09:12.130
<v Speaker 1>That what pounds heavier you over Romero.</v>

4929
02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:16.870
<v Speaker 1>When you were saying he gained only really 80 but think about the difference</v>

4930
02:09:16.871 --> 02:09:21.871
<v Speaker 1>between a one 85 are in a to 65 gigantic to 65 world class striking.</v>

4931
02:09:23.170 --> 02:09:24.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's only 80 pounds.</v>

4932
02:09:24.281 --> 02:09:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm exaggerating by saying 100 but not by much.</v>

4933
02:09:27.370 --> 02:09:28.600
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't really be able to tell the difference.</v>

4934
02:09:28.601 --> 02:09:29.231
<v Speaker 1>He was 20 pounds.</v>

4935
02:09:29.231 --> 02:09:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Come on son,</v>

4936
02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:33.490
<v Speaker 1>when he fought Brock.</v>

4937
02:09:35.050 --> 02:09:35.590
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

4938
02:09:35.590 --> 02:09:36.423
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

4939
02:09:36.910 --> 02:09:37.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4940
02:09:37.061 --> 02:09:39.970
<v Speaker 1>I bet that's as big as a man can get.</v>

4941
02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:41.740
<v Speaker 1>And it's fun to be functional.</v>

4942
02:09:41.741 --> 02:09:42.574
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4943
02:09:43.690 --> 02:09:44.411
<v Speaker 1>he was amazing.</v>

4944
02:09:44.411 --> 02:09:46.070
<v Speaker 1>You guys are given white guys love babies.</v>

4945
02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:47.710
<v Speaker 1>I think you guys are free.</v>

4946
02:09:48.910 --> 02:09:49.391
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

4947
02:09:49.391 --> 02:09:50.224
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4948
02:09:50.500 --> 02:09:53.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that had sex right there.</v>

4949
02:09:54.460 --> 02:09:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Country,</v>

4950
02:09:55.150 --> 02:09:55.983
<v Speaker 1>big country,</v>

4951
02:09:56.620 --> 02:10:01.000
<v Speaker 1>last fight with Rochelle and that guy has a lot of fucking Twitter followers.</v>

4952
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:02.490
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Facebook live.</v>

4953
02:10:02.970 --> 02:10:03.631
<v Speaker 1>People love him.</v>

4954
02:10:03.631 --> 02:10:04.510
<v Speaker 1>So just seems like it's,</v>

4955
02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:06.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not capitalized on enough.</v>

4956
02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:07.330
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4957
02:10:07.330 --> 02:10:07.901
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

4958
02:10:07.901 --> 02:10:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

4959
02:10:08.340 --> 02:10:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Marika loves enough.</v>

4960
02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:09.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4961
02:10:09.851 --> 02:10:13.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems like someone somehow should have taken advantage.</v>

4962
02:10:13.841 --> 02:10:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Some company should have a scooped him up for commercials or stuff like that,</v>

4963
02:10:17.381 --> 02:10:18.310
<v Speaker 1>but reality show,</v>

4964
02:10:18.700 --> 02:10:18.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4965
02:10:18.980 --> 02:10:20.110

<v Speaker 1>I haven't talked to Roy a while.</v>

02:15:23.740 --> 02:15:28.670
<v Speaker 1>You can walk across the land naked for me.</v>

5166
02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:29.920
<v Speaker 1>A snake had a snake.</v>

5167
02:15:29.921 --> 02:15:30.120
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:30.741
<v Speaker 1>What are we talking about?</v>

5169
02:15:30.741 --> 02:15:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Africa and people will lose to keep them as pets because they're cool.</v>

5170
02:15:34.410 --> 02:15:36.840
<v Speaker 1>And what they would do is these fucking fish you,</v>

5171
02:15:36.841 --> 02:15:40.500
<v Speaker 1>they would get sick of them so they would let them know their mom's sister</v>

5172
02:15:40.510 --> 02:15:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

5173
02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:41.941
<v Speaker 1>They're monsters.</v>

5174
02:15:41.941 --> 02:15:42.840
<v Speaker 1>They're dinosaurs.</v>

5175
02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Walk on land.</v>

5176
02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:45.413
<v Speaker 1>Well you understand,</v>

5177
02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:45.920

02:15:48.420 --> 02:15:48.631
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to affect your Barracuda Samey.</v>

5183
02:15:51.150 --> 02:15:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Pull up snake head in the Congo,</v>

5184

5185
02:15:54.151 --> 02:15:55.440
<v Speaker 1>land in the video,</v>

5186
02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:55.861
<v Speaker 1>hold up.</v>

5187
02:15:55.861 --> 02:15:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Those things walk on like one.</v>

5188
02:15:58.230 --> 02:16:01.080
<v Speaker 1>They walked from one pond to another pond across the grounds.</v>

5189
02:16:01.081 --> 02:16:01.914
<v Speaker 1>Things are awesome.</v>

5190
02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Like they come out of the water and they walk.</v>

5191
02:16:04.170 --> 02:16:05.340
<v Speaker 1>They're not very popular though,</v>

5192
02:16:05.341 --> 02:16:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

5193
02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5194
02:16:06.180 --> 02:16:07.080
<v Speaker 1>they're monsters.</v>

5195
02:16:07.770 --> 02:16:09.180
<v Speaker 1>This is a snake head.</v>

5196
02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5197
02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:10.560
<v Speaker 1>in Thailand.</v>

5198
02:16:10.620 --> 02:16:10.891
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5199
02:16:10.891 --> 02:16:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Here this is,</v>

5200
02:16:13.170 --> 02:16:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I dunno if this is a Bandanna on him.</v>

5201
02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:15.481
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5202
02:16:15.481 --> 02:16:16.320
<v Speaker 1>this is not it.</v>

5203
02:16:16.321 --> 02:16:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

5204
02:16:16.860 --> 02:16:17.281
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

5205
02:16:17.281 --> 02:16:17.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5206
02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:19.500
<v Speaker 1>we want to see the one Congo,</v>

5207
02:16:19.501 --> 02:16:20.334
<v Speaker 1>cause this thing,</v>

5208
02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:22.470
<v Speaker 1>this is what he caught.</v>

5209
02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's going to show it walking.</v>

5210
02:16:24.061 --> 02:16:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe snakehead fish walking.</v>

5211
02:16:26.011 --> 02:16:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Are they dangerous at all?</v>

5212
02:16:27.420 --> 02:16:28.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

5213
02:16:28.410 --> 02:16:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean not to.</v>

5214
02:16:28.860 --> 02:16:29.693
<v Speaker 1>They're not dangerous.</v>

5215
02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:31.440
<v Speaker 1>We mean they'll probably,</v>

5216
02:16:32.540 --> 02:16:33.430
<v Speaker 1>I need something to attack,</v>

5217
02:16:33.431 --> 02:16:36.550
<v Speaker 1>but the really big ones you have to worry about the Congo.</v>

5218
02:16:36.551 --> 02:16:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Remember those spiders that attacking swarms?</v>

5219
02:16:38.550 --> 02:16:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5220
02:16:39.310 --> 02:16:40.001
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>

5221
02:16:40.001 --> 02:16:41.590
<v Speaker 1>They usually solitary in the states,</v>

5222
02:16:41.591 --> 02:16:46.591
<v Speaker 1>but in the Congo they fucking swarmy spiders swarm.</v>

5223
02:16:46.930 --> 02:16:48.820
<v Speaker 1>They make these giant animals,</v>

5224
02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:49.301
<v Speaker 1>not people.</v>

5225
02:16:49.301 --> 02:16:49.880
<v Speaker 1>They're not people.</v>

5226
02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5227
02:16:50.130 --> 02:16:51.910
<v Speaker 1>they catch like squirrels and shit.</v>

5228
02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Spiders too.</v>

5229
02:16:52.740 --> 02:16:53.573
<v Speaker 1>It's nice.</v>

5230
02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:56.290
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the ones that are big enough to catch birds,</v>

5231
02:16:56.291 --> 02:16:56.580
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

5232
02:16:56.580 --> 02:16:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5233
02:16:56.950 --> 02:16:58.110
<v Speaker 1>I love acute squirrel though.</v>

5234
02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:00.590
<v Speaker 1>But it's worse than fucking spider swarming on Ya.</v>

5235
02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:00.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5236
02:17:00.941 --> 02:17:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Jamie gets look at for it in the Congo because this is not,</v>

5237
02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:06.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a BBC documentary and the Congo.</v>

5238
02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

5239
02:17:06.670 --> 02:17:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not exactly listed as naked.</v>

5240
02:17:09.071 --> 02:17:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I was saying the wrong name,</v>

5241
02:17:10.630 --> 02:17:11.381
<v Speaker 1>but I know snake.</v>

5242
02:17:11.381 --> 02:17:12.520
<v Speaker 1>It is a similar fish.</v>

5243
02:17:12.700 --> 02:17:16.540
<v Speaker 1>That's these vase of species from other countries that just takes over.</v>

5244
02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:19.510
<v Speaker 1>It sounds trying to one up each other.</v>

5245
02:17:19.511 --> 02:17:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Calculus walking on the land.</v>

5246
02:17:20.921 --> 02:17:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

5247
02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Look at this thing.</v>

5248
02:17:21.980 --> 02:17:22.813
<v Speaker 1>Walking on the land.</v>

5249
02:17:24.010 --> 02:17:25.840
<v Speaker 1>They're walking until they find another,</v>

5250
02:17:25.841 --> 02:17:26.674
<v Speaker 1>another lake.</v>

5281
02:18:14.831 --> 02:18:16.060
<v Speaker 1>you'd get a sense of perspective.</v>

5282
02:18:16.090 --> 02:18:17.350
<v Speaker 1>You would be terrified by the thing.</v>

5471
02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:43.111
<v Speaker 3>they paid for that.</v>

5472
02:22:43.111 --> 02:22:43.860
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever watched it?</v>

5473
02:22:43.860 --> 02:22:46.080
<v Speaker 3>She sent me a funny graphic of that.</v>

5474
02:22:46.081 --> 02:22:46.740
<v Speaker 3>The other horrible,</v>

5475
02:22:46.740 --> 02:22:49.200
<v Speaker 3>I just got sent a die in a group message about,</v>

5476
02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:51.070
<v Speaker 3>it's all smashed point.</v>

5477
02:22:51.170 --> 02:22:51.901
<v Speaker 3>It's point of view.</v>

5478
02:22:51.901 --> 02:22:55.410
<v Speaker 3>So it's a guy sitting there and he's videotaping his legs open and he has two</v>

5479
02:22:55.411 --> 02:22:55.681
<v Speaker 3>major,</v>

5480
02:22:55.681 --> 02:22:58.140
<v Speaker 3>it's in little outfits run up and started kicking him and stomping on him.</v>

5481
02:22:59.000 --> 02:22:59.310
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>

5482
02:22:59.310 --> 02:23:00.720
<v Speaker 3>that thing you sent me today,</v>

5483
02:23:01.050 --> 02:23:03.480
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate sack fighting thing.</v>

5484
02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:04.650
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>

5485
02:23:05.130 --> 02:23:07.040
<v Speaker 3>They did exactly what he did it twice,</v>

5486
02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:11.190
<v Speaker 3>twice college humor that two of our schedules are Matt Mantra.</v>

5487
02:23:11.191 --> 02:23:14.730
<v Speaker 3>There must be a writer for car that worked for the man show.</v>

5488
02:23:14.731 --> 02:23:18.360
<v Speaker 3>There has to be because they did extreme sack planning when they heard us</v>

5489
02:23:18.361 --> 02:23:20.940
<v Speaker 3>talking about it and the Jesus a cross trainer.</v>

5490
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:23.221
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5491
02:23:23.221 --> 02:23:25.740
<v Speaker 3>But it is possible that someone came up with it on their own.</v>

5492
02:23:25.770 --> 02:23:26.880
<v Speaker 3>It is totally possible.</v>

5493
02:23:26.881 --> 02:23:28.320
<v Speaker 3>You guys talked about on and talked about it.</v>

5494
02:23:28.321 --> 02:23:29.550
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about on my podcast</v>

5495
02:23:31.250 --> 02:23:31.470
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

5496
02:23:31.470 --> 02:23:32.303
<v Speaker 3>how long ago?</v>

5497
02:23:32.460 --> 02:23:34.720
<v Speaker 3>Like a couple of fighting,</v>

5498
02:23:34.730 --> 02:23:36.960
<v Speaker 3>you know we talked about I think on mine too,</v>

5499
02:23:36.961 --> 02:23:37.920
<v Speaker 3>like way back in the day.</v>

5500
02:23:37.921 --> 02:23:41.100
<v Speaker 3>I think we're talking about different sketches that we did that where we did,</v>

5501
02:23:41.101 --> 02:23:44.520
<v Speaker 3>cause we had to have Bobby Lee and Joey Diaz and Joey Diaz kept losing.</v>

5502
02:23:44.521 --> 02:23:45.540
<v Speaker 3>His balls are too big.</v>

5503
02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:45.681
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5504
02:23:45.681 --> 02:23:46.630
<v Speaker 3>So he became a trainer,</v>

5505
02:23:46.631 --> 02:23:49.500
<v Speaker 3>Bobby Lee one we were going to give him some fig balls are like that big.</v>

5506
02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:53.190
<v Speaker 3>Bobby Lou was the master and it would go and visit him.</v>

5507
02:23:53.340 --> 02:23:53.790
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

5508
02:23:53.790 --> 02:23:56.550
<v Speaker 3>he's on an island somewhere and teach you how to sacrifice correctly.</v>

5509
02:23:56.580 --> 02:23:57.020
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>

5510
02:23:57.020 --> 02:23:58.200
<v Speaker 3>you just couldn't touch his nuts.</v>

5511
02:23:58.220 --> 02:23:59.750
<v Speaker 3>There were so small future of MMA.</v>

5512
02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:00.540
<v Speaker 3>Eventually,</v>

5513
02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:04.110
<v Speaker 3>eventually state by state are going to legalize ball hitting when the balls are</v>

5514
02:24:04.111 --> 02:24:06.000
<v Speaker 3>in play came changes.</v>

5515
02:24:06.540 --> 02:24:07.620
<v Speaker 3>We had a whole fucking</v>

5516
02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:10.590
<v Speaker 3>made it.</v>

5517
02:24:10.590 --> 02:24:12.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if the be I,</v>

5518
02:24:12.421 --> 02:24:15.780
<v Speaker 3>am I giving them the benefit of the doubt.</v>

5519
02:24:15.870 --> 02:24:16.920
<v Speaker 3>That's what I do from now on.</v>

5520
02:24:17.490 --> 02:24:18.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

5521
02:24:18.180 --> 02:24:20.410
<v Speaker 3>We know when people are bullshit artist and rip off artists,</v>

5522
02:24:20.430 --> 02:24:20.930
<v Speaker 3>but it just,</v>

5523
02:24:20.930 --> 02:24:22.530
<v Speaker 3>it always comes to surface.</v>

5524
02:24:23.340 --> 02:24:24.660
<v Speaker 3>You know that thing,</v>

5525
02:24:24.670 --> 02:24:25.740
<v Speaker 3>the Internet,</v>

5526
02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:26.670
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of a,</v>

5527
02:24:26.670 --> 02:24:27.503
<v Speaker 3>it's going to get,</v>

5528
02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:29.010
<v Speaker 3>you know these guys,</v>

5529
02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:33.180
<v Speaker 3>it could've easily been that they came up with on their own or it could have</v>

5530
02:24:33.181 --> 02:24:33.691
<v Speaker 3>been like,</v>

5531
02:24:33.691 --> 02:24:34.710
<v Speaker 3>these guys had great ideas.</v>

5532
02:24:34.711 --> 02:24:35.521
<v Speaker 3>They didn't even do it,</v>

5533
02:24:35.521 --> 02:24:37.860
<v Speaker 3>so fuck them and there may have been a podcast.</v>

5534
02:24:37.890 --> 02:24:41.340
<v Speaker 3>There may have been a podcast where I went through all our sketches that got,</v>

5535
02:24:41.410 --> 02:24:41.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5536
02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:42.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5537
02:24:42.570 --> 02:24:43.403
<v Speaker 3>turned down</v>

5538
02:24:45.850 --> 02:24:46.890
<v Speaker 3>and I talked about them.</v>

5539
02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:49.110
<v Speaker 3>And I think once or twice I may have said,</v>

5540
02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:49.651
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

5541
02:24:49.651 --> 02:24:51.390
<v Speaker 3>if someone out there wants to run with it,</v>

5542
02:24:51.391 --> 02:24:52.560
<v Speaker 3>run with it and you fuck up</v>

5543
02:24:54.270 --> 02:24:54.661
<v Speaker 3>nobody,</v>

5544
02:24:54.661 --> 02:24:55.680
<v Speaker 3>you're not feeling well.</v>

5545
02:24:55.681 --> 02:24:57.650
<v Speaker 3>You would never get away with it any way so far.</v>

5546
02:24:57.651 --> 02:24:58.570
<v Speaker 3>It'd be hard to prove.</v>

5547
02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:01.410
<v Speaker 3>That was never even a thought.</v>

5548
02:25:01.411 --> 02:25:03.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that that was our shit.</v>

5549
02:25:03.690 --> 02:25:03.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5550
02:25:03.871 --> 02:25:04.704
<v Speaker 3>because if you,</v>

5551
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:05.543
<v Speaker 3>12 years ago,</v>

5552
02:25:05.550 --> 02:25:07.620
<v Speaker 3>if you come up with an idea but you don't do anything about,</v>

5553
02:25:07.621 --> 02:25:10.020
<v Speaker 3>and you talk about the idea and then someone else does something with it,</v>

5554
02:25:10.021 --> 02:25:13.350
<v Speaker 3>that's so much different than you having already done the sketch and then</v>

5555
02:25:13.351 --> 02:25:14.550
<v Speaker 3>someone ripping off the sketch.</v>

5556
02:25:14.590 --> 02:25:15.330
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

5557
02:25:15.330 --> 02:25:17.130

5559
02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:19.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited for this fight.</v>

5874
02:32:53.970 --> 02:32:54.790
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

5875
02:32:54.790 --> 02:32:55.591
<v Speaker 3>I know what it is,</v>

5876
02:32:55.591 --> 02:32:58.290
<v Speaker 3>is I've had a lot of people promise me they're going to help me do it and help</v>

02:32:58.291 --> 02:32:58.860
<v Speaker 3>me figure it out.</v>

5878
02:32:58.860 --> 02:33:00.620
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'm kind of retarded when the podcasts,</v>

5879
02:33:00.980 --> 02:33:01.310

<v Speaker 3>And then it just never happened.</v>

5882
02:33:03.571 --> 02:33:05.010
<v Speaker 3>And I guess I'm too lazy on my own,</v>

5883
02:33:05.011 --> 02:33:05.850

<v Speaker 3>I got one of those for not filling out my app.</v>

6027
02:36:56.110 --> 02:36:56.950
<v Speaker 3>Am I gonna get in trouble for it?</v>

6028
02:36:56.951 --> 02:36:57.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about this.</v>

6029
02:36:57.640 --> 02:36:58.420
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6030
02:36:58.420 --> 02:36:59.253
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

6031
02:36:59.890 --> 02:37:00.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6032
02:37:01.540 --> 02:37:04.480
<v Speaker 3>but for not filling out my whereabouts in time.</v>

6033
02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:05.950
<v Speaker 3>And they sent me a letter and I was like,</v>

6034
02:37:05.951 --> 02:37:06.311
<v Speaker 3>Dad,</v>

6035
02:37:06.311 --> 02:37:06.551
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

6036
02:37:06.551 --> 02:37:09.310
<v Speaker 3>cause like it's like the fucking principal sent me a letter not figuring out,</v>

6037
02:37:09.311 --> 02:37:09.940
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

6038
02:37:09.940 --> 02:37:11.680
<v Speaker 3>you know it alls with good intentions.</v>

6039
02:37:11.681 --> 02:37:13.180
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to catch more people.</v>

6040
02:37:13.210 --> 02:37:13.961
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good,</v>

6041
02:37:13.961 --> 02:37:15.590
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people,</v>

6042
02:37:15.770 --> 02:37:15.980
<v Speaker 3>which</v>

6043
02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:16.781
<v Speaker 1>is pretty fucking funny.</v>

6044
02:37:16.781 --> 02:37:20.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of people will find the same.</v>

6045
02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:22.300
<v Speaker 1>If it was up to you with what,</v>

6046
02:37:22.301 --> 02:37:22.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6047
02:37:22.820 --> 02:37:27.020
<v Speaker 1>would you legalize a pds because it's up to you.</v>

6048
02:37:28.580 --> 02:37:29.840
<v Speaker 1>That's a slippery slope.</v>

6049
02:37:29.841 --> 02:37:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Tough fucking slope.</v>

6050
02:37:31.410 --> 02:37:32.060
<v Speaker 1>They illegal.</v>

6051
02:37:32.060 --> 02:37:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was legal and pride.</v>

6052
02:37:33.321 --> 02:37:34.154
<v Speaker 1>Look what happened.</v>

6053
02:37:34.310 --> 02:37:35.001
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen?</v>

6054
02:37:35.001 --> 02:37:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6055
02:37:35.330 --> 02:37:36.200
<v Speaker 1>pride would happen.</v>

6056
02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:38.593
<v Speaker 1>It's tough man.</v>

6057
02:37:38.620 --> 02:37:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Think Joe,</v>

6058
02:37:39.310 --> 02:37:40.143
<v Speaker 1>it won't be,</v>

6059
02:37:40.310 --> 02:37:41.810
<v Speaker 1>it won't be mainstream if you do that.</v>

6060
02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:43.970
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a better name.</v>

6061
02:37:44.060 --> 02:37:44.210
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

6062
02:37:44.210 --> 02:37:45.043
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem.</v>

6063
02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:46.910
<v Speaker 1>What we're trying to do is stop progress.</v>

6064
02:37:46.940 --> 02:37:48.440
<v Speaker 1>The reason why steroids are awesome,</v>

6065
02:37:48.470 --> 02:37:50.720
<v Speaker 1>it's because they work really good at changing your body,</v>

6066
02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:52.040
<v Speaker 1>making you perform better.</v>

6067
02:37:52.220 --> 02:37:52.851
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately we,</v>

6068
02:37:52.851 --> 02:37:53.870
<v Speaker 1>we're watching fighting.</v>

6069
02:37:54.020 --> 02:37:54.890
<v Speaker 1>What are we trying to say?</v>

6070
02:37:54.891 --> 02:37:56.900
<v Speaker 1>We try to see people perform at their best,</v>

6071
02:37:57.050 --> 02:38:00.710
<v Speaker 1>so we're keeping them from the knowledge that we're currently aware of.</v>

6072
02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:02.960
<v Speaker 1>What do we currently aware of when it comes to performing hands?</v>

6073
02:38:02.990 --> 02:38:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Drugs.</v>

6074
02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:04.281
<v Speaker 1>If you use them,</v>

6075
02:38:04.281 --> 02:38:05.330
<v Speaker 1>your body will work better.</v>

6076
02:38:05.570 --> 02:38:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Your body will be stronger.</v>

6077
02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:07.401
<v Speaker 1>It'll move quickly.</v>

6078
02:38:07.401 --> 02:38:08.270
<v Speaker 1>You have more endurance.</v>

6079
02:38:08.271 --> 02:38:12.890
<v Speaker 1>You'll be able to perform tasks with much more veracity and intensity for longer</v>

6080
02:38:12.891 --> 02:38:13.724
<v Speaker 1>periods of time,</v>

6081
02:38:14.510 --> 02:38:16.250
<v Speaker 1>so how can they can't do it because the,</v>

6082
02:38:16.370 --> 02:38:19.970
<v Speaker 1>because using that knowledge right now is forbidden,</v>

6083
02:38:20.210 --> 02:38:21.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to come a point in time,</v>

6084
02:38:21.711 --> 02:38:23.900
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a year from now or 20 years from now,</v>

6085
02:38:23.930 --> 02:38:24.763
<v Speaker 1>30 years from now,</v>

6086
02:38:25.010 --> 02:38:28.160
<v Speaker 1>where they're going to have some undeniable shit is everybody's taking that</v>

6087
02:38:28.161 --> 02:38:30.800
<v Speaker 1>people would just normally taking because it keeps you from getting sick.</v>

6088
02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:32.450
<v Speaker 1>It changes the way your body works.</v>

6089
02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:33.051
<v Speaker 1>Your body,</v>

6090
02:38:33.051 --> 02:38:35.090
<v Speaker 1>like a regular person's body looks like Yoel Romero,</v>

6091
02:38:35.091 --> 02:38:35.840
<v Speaker 1>his body,</v>

6092
02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:36.680
<v Speaker 1>we're all going to take it,</v>

6093
02:38:36.681 --> 02:38:37.440
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>

6094
02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:39.500
<v Speaker 1>but then all athletes would be taking it then.</v>

6095
02:38:39.501 --> 02:38:40.281
<v Speaker 1>Then it's going to get real,</v>

6096
02:38:40.281 --> 02:38:40.911
<v Speaker 1>super weird.</v>

6097
02:38:40.911 --> 02:38:41.181
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

6098
02:38:41.181 --> 02:38:43.910
<v Speaker 1>well what happened all those years when you couldn't take it or you had a high</v>

6099
02:38:43.911 --> 02:38:46.250
<v Speaker 1>that you were taking it because now they're going to have stuff that makes you,</v>

6100
02:38:46.620 --> 02:38:48.440
<v Speaker 1>there's not going to be people anymore.</v>

6101
02:38:48.620 --> 02:38:51.830
<v Speaker 1>We're going to come a time when 30 or 40 years where genetic engineering has</v>

6102
02:38:51.831 --> 02:38:52.730
<v Speaker 1>reached a point where we're,</v>

6103
02:38:52.940 --> 02:38:54.550
<v Speaker 1>we're engineering human bad.</v>

6104
02:38:54.551 --> 02:38:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I want to be around.</v>

6105
02:38:55.180 --> 02:38:56.120
<v Speaker 1>You got to have a designer.</v>

6106
02:38:56.150 --> 02:38:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Why it's going to be awesome.</v>

6107
02:38:57.530 --> 02:38:58.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be the Hawk fuck off.</v>

6108
02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:00.193
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to jump over.</v>

6109
02:39:00.310 --> 02:39:05.310
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be 110 we're all going to be 110 but you're going to be 110 with</v>

6110
02:39:05.481 --> 02:39:08.150
<v Speaker 1>the science that comes from surviving till then.</v>

6111
02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:09.800
<v Speaker 1>They say that if you can live,</v>

6112
02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:11.120
<v Speaker 1>if you can live today,</v>

6113
02:39:11.121 --> 02:39:14.630
<v Speaker 1>if you're like a 30 year old guy today and you could live to be 50 you could</v>

6114
02:39:14.631 --> 02:39:16.790
<v Speaker 1>probably live to be 200 fuck off.</v>

6115
02:39:16.791 --> 02:39:17.260
<v Speaker 1>For reals.</v>

6116
02:39:17.260 --> 02:39:18.093
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

6117
02:39:18.130 --> 02:39:18.700
<v Speaker 1>I've heard all day.</v>

6118
02:39:18.700 --> 02:39:21.560
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about within our lifetime,</v>

6119
02:39:21.620 --> 02:39:23.640
<v Speaker 1>some ground breaking life,</v>

6120
02:39:23.641 --> 02:39:27.200
<v Speaker 1>changing shit in life extension and how long you can,</v>

6121
02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:29.990
<v Speaker 1>how long have you live and how healthy you can be.</v>

6122
02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:31.071
<v Speaker 1>That guy,</v>

6123
02:39:31.071 --> 02:39:32.630
<v Speaker 1>that doctor Peter Welling,</v>

6124
02:39:32.631 --> 02:39:33.464
<v Speaker 1>whenever his name is,</v>

6125
02:39:33.470 --> 02:39:34.700
<v Speaker 1>the Regena Cain doctor,</v>

6126
02:39:34.910 --> 02:39:37.340
<v Speaker 1>they're that close to some new thing.</v>

6127
02:39:37.341 --> 02:39:39.920
<v Speaker 1>They're going to do it with college and I don't know how it works,</v>

6128
02:39:39.921 --> 02:39:41.810
<v Speaker 1>but apparently the breakthrough,</v>

6129
02:39:41.811 --> 02:39:46.100
<v Speaker 1>if they can prove what they believe they can prove and then do what they think</v>

6130
02:39:46.101 --> 02:39:46.470
<v Speaker 1>they can do,</v>

6131
02:39:46.470 --> 02:39:47.910
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna be able to regenerate college.</v>

6132
02:39:47.930 --> 02:39:51.110
<v Speaker 1>And people like what makes someone an old person is your college and sort of</v>

6133
02:39:51.111 --> 02:39:51.944
<v Speaker 1>falls apart.</v>

6134
02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Your face consult droopy,</v>

6135
02:39:53.481 --> 02:39:54.830
<v Speaker 1>you lose the elasticity.</v>

6136
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Well they going to be a little regenerate chicken glass half full with this</v>

6137
02:39:59.301 --> 02:40:01.300
<v Speaker 1>fucking Guy Joe.</v>

6138
02:40:01.340 --> 02:40:05.750
<v Speaker 1>How full or am I a real list you don't have to pull is half full is actually</v>

6139
02:40:05.751 --> 02:40:06.584
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

6140
02:40:06.910 --> 02:40:07.743
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

6141
02:40:08.180 --> 02:40:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

6142
02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

6143
02:40:09.380 --> 02:40:10.180
<v Speaker 1>I was joking.</v>

6144
02:40:10.180 --> 02:40:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

6145
02:40:10.730 --> 02:40:11.080
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

6146
02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I actually said it wrong.</v>

6147
02:40:12.171 --> 02:40:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I meant to say they did empty,</v>

6148
02:40:13.830 --> 02:40:14.040
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

6149
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:15.390
<v Speaker 3>that is what you're doing is trying to help you.</v>

6150
02:40:15.391 --> 02:40:16.110
<v Speaker 3>Brendan isn't,</v>

6151
02:40:16.110 --> 02:40:16.950
<v Speaker 3>you're going to,</v>

6152
02:40:16.980 --> 02:40:18.990
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to accept science.</v>

6153
02:40:19.150 --> 02:40:19.983
<v Speaker 3>Brian did Chubb,</v>

6154
02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:28.760
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying that,</v>

6155
02:40:28.761 --> 02:40:29.594
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying</v>

6156
02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:32.190
<v Speaker 3>if you were a kid and you got polio,</v>

6157
02:40:32.460 --> 02:40:32.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6158
02:40:32.910 --> 02:40:36.300
<v Speaker 3>back in the day it was over and then they had to come up with the vaccines and</v>

6159
02:40:36.301 --> 02:40:37.530
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden no polio.</v>

6160
02:40:37.710 --> 02:40:38.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean the all,</v>

6161
02:40:38.580 --> 02:40:41.100
<v Speaker 3>there's the thing about all the different things that they figured out today.</v>

6162
02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:42.690
<v Speaker 3>He used to break your leg three,</v>

6163
02:40:42.691 --> 02:40:43.381
<v Speaker 3>400 years ago.</v>

6164
02:40:43.381 --> 02:40:44.760
<v Speaker 3>You're fucked now.</v>

6165
02:40:44.761 --> 02:40:45.594
<v Speaker 3>You break your leg,</v>

6166
02:40:45.690 --> 02:40:48.750
<v Speaker 3>they fucking screw some plates in that big stitch y'all up and you're good to</v>

6167
02:40:48.751 --> 02:40:49.010
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

6168
02:40:49.010 --> 02:40:49.430
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

6169
02:40:49.430 --> 02:40:53.310
<v Speaker 3>They mean uncle creepys had how many fucking surgeries.</v>

6170
02:40:53.311 --> 02:40:54.144
<v Speaker 3>Think about that.</v>

6171
02:40:54.240 --> 02:40:55.680
<v Speaker 3>All this stuff that you had done to you.</v>

6172
02:40:55.830 --> 02:40:57.240
<v Speaker 3>If you live 500 years ago,</v>

6173
02:40:57.241 --> 02:40:58.200
<v Speaker 3>you'd be dead man.</v>

6174
02:40:58.260 --> 02:40:58.471
<v Speaker 3>I'd be,</v>

6175
02:40:58.471 --> 02:40:58.891
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah,</v>

6176
02:40:58.891 --> 02:41:00.510
<v Speaker 3>it'd be dead and I would be too.</v>

6177
02:41:00.511 --> 02:41:03.240
<v Speaker 3>And you'd be all fucked up and when you would be fucked up,</v>

6178
02:41:03.241 --> 02:41:04.170
<v Speaker 3>cause you've ever heard of nobody.</v>

6179
02:41:04.500 --> 02:41:05.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about the hernia surgery.</v>

6180
02:41:05.820 --> 02:41:06.653
<v Speaker 3>Could to be alive.</v>

6181
02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:07.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6182
02:41:07.021 --> 02:41:07.651
<v Speaker 3>but you'd be fine.</v>

6183
02:41:07.651 --> 02:41:09.120
<v Speaker 3>But you'd have like a big holes where you're,</v>

6184
02:41:09.300 --> 02:41:09.481
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6185
02:41:09.481 --> 02:41:10.310
<v Speaker 3>they've figured it out,</v>

6186
02:41:10.310 --> 02:41:13.860
<v Speaker 3>her use her screaming and yelling and I wouldn't be screaming and yelling and</v>

6187
02:41:13.950 --> 02:41:15.560
<v Speaker 3>you don't know 17 id,</v>

6188
02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:16.470
<v Speaker 3>you might,</v>

6189
02:41:16.470 --> 02:41:17.550
<v Speaker 3>you would definitely be screaming,</v>

6190
02:41:17.551 --> 02:41:17.881
<v Speaker 3>yelling,</v>

6191
02:41:17.881 --> 02:41:22.260
<v Speaker 3>don't hate me running Zombie hordes.</v>

6192
02:41:22.290 --> 02:41:23.950
<v Speaker 3>But my point is that they,</v>

6193
02:41:23.980 --> 02:41:25.620
<v Speaker 3>these guys are going to keep innovating.</v>

6194
02:41:25.650 --> 02:41:28.980
<v Speaker 3>Every new invention opens a door for other new inventions.</v>

6195
02:41:28.981 --> 02:41:33.320
<v Speaker 3>Every new technology opens the door for a whole branch of new technologies that</v>

6196
02:41:33.321 --> 02:41:34.154
<v Speaker 3>would come from it.</v>

6197
02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:34.971
<v Speaker 3>And so they're,</v>

6198
02:41:34.971 --> 02:41:37.950
<v Speaker 3>they're on their way to figuring out how to regenerate tissue.</v>

6199
02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:40.080
<v Speaker 3>The stem cell shit that they're doing today,</v>

6200
02:41:40.470 --> 02:41:40.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6201
02:41:40.861 --> 02:41:41.191
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6202
02:41:41.191 --> 02:41:41.761
<v Speaker 3>they're doing some,</v>

6203
02:41:41.761 --> 02:41:42.151
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

6204
02:41:42.151 --> 02:41:44.970
<v Speaker 3>it's at boss ruin was telling me about how they shot stem cells in them</v>

6205
02:41:44.971 --> 02:41:45.870
<v Speaker 3>intravenously.</v>

6206
02:41:46.100 --> 02:41:47.040
<v Speaker 3>If that's the they with me.</v>

6207
02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh really brilliant.</v>

6208
02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:50.490
<v Speaker 3>Intervenient stem cell and then spot injection.</v>

6209
02:41:50.940 --> 02:41:51.930
<v Speaker 3>Where did they get the stem cells?</v>

6210
02:41:53.220 --> 02:41:54.570
<v Speaker 3>Are you sure it wasn't PRP?</v>

6211
02:41:54.820 --> 02:41:55.970
<v Speaker 3>I was both know,</v>

6212
02:41:56.350 --> 02:41:56.710
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

6213
02:41:56.710 --> 02:42:01.110
<v Speaker 3>I've had both of them that the stem cells is stem cells and they are doing stem</v>

6214
02:42:01.111 --> 02:42:01.411
<v Speaker 3>cells.</v>

6215
02:42:01.411 --> 02:42:01.591
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

6216
02:42:01.591 --> 02:42:05.910
<v Speaker 3>The one that I did with in Vegas was from a woman's placenta from young women</v>

6217
02:42:05.911 --> 02:42:07.210
<v Speaker 3>that gets a Syrian sections.</v>

6218
02:42:07.220 --> 02:42:09.780
<v Speaker 3>He took the placenta and they converted stem cells.</v>

6219
02:42:09.870 --> 02:42:10.703
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6220
02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:12.240
<v Speaker 3>What did it,</v>

6221
02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:14.130
<v Speaker 3>what did it feel like when they shot at intravenously?</v>

6222
02:42:14.940 --> 02:42:15.690
<v Speaker 3>I didn't feel anything.</v>

6223
02:42:15.690 --> 02:42:16.150
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

6224
02:42:16.150 --> 02:42:18.450
<v Speaker 3>I was sitting there and you know,</v>

6225
02:42:18.451 --> 02:42:20.550
<v Speaker 3>we got it done and kind of work.</v>

6226
02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:21.900
<v Speaker 3>Did you feel like amazing?</v>

6227
02:42:22.410 --> 02:42:23.430
<v Speaker 3>Well I mean it's all,</v>

6228
02:42:23.490 --> 02:42:24.031
<v Speaker 3>it's all here,</v>

6229
02:42:24.031 --> 02:42:24.340
<v Speaker 3>but my,</v>

6230
02:42:24.340 --> 02:42:26.080
<v Speaker 3>my shoulder's healed up the shore.</v>

6231
02:42:26.090 --> 02:42:27.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm still smaller than this one.</v>

6232
02:42:27.430 --> 02:42:29.160
<v Speaker 3>It just keeps coming out of socket.</v>

6233
02:42:29.730 --> 02:42:29.881
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6234
02:42:29.881 --> 02:42:30.060
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6235
02:42:30.060 --> 02:42:30.300
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6236
02:42:30.300 --> 02:42:30.480
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

6237
02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:31.500
<v Speaker 3>I had torn all,</v>

6238
02:42:31.620 --> 02:42:32.880
<v Speaker 3>all four of the parts,</v>

6239
02:42:32.881 --> 02:42:33.714
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6240
02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:36.960
<v Speaker 3>and now it's this thing just pop like I thought I felt the pop it down here and</v>

6241
02:42:36.961 --> 02:42:39.420
<v Speaker 3>like the muscle tendon had nothing to do with the,</v>

6242
02:42:39.910 --> 02:42:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh will.</v>

6243
02:42:40.210 --> 02:42:44.250
<v Speaker 3>I tore down here a little bit when I tore my shoulder and now this is kind of</v>

6244
02:42:44.251 --> 02:42:45.930
<v Speaker 3>where it popped so chore again.</v>

6245
02:42:45.931 --> 02:42:47.850
<v Speaker 3>So there's issues with the whole chain.</v>

6246
02:42:47.910 --> 02:42:48.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6247
02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:53.200
<v Speaker 3>just the tool chain that I've been fighting with one arm for one hand at least</v>

6248
02:42:53.281 --> 02:42:55.320
<v Speaker 3>for a couple of years doing work though.</v>

6249
02:42:55.830 --> 02:42:58.290
<v Speaker 3>If one arm or punch him people with this thing sucks.</v>

02:43:00.481 --> 02:43:01.910
<v Speaker 3>you can't make a fist to fist.</v>

6253
02:43:01.970 --> 02:43:02.803
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6254
02:43:02.830 --> 02:43:02.941
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

6255
02:43:02.941 --> 02:43:03.691
<v Speaker 3>The one finger.</v>

6256
02:43:03.691 --> 02:43:04.470
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

6257
02:43:04.470 --> 02:43:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Good fire at that point that,</v>

6258
02:43:05.790 --> 02:43:06.623
<v Speaker 3>that operated on it.</v>

6259
02:43:09.860 --> 02:43:10.980
<v Speaker 6>You better get on that.</v>

6260
02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:13.743
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

6261
02:43:14.390 --> 02:43:15.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

6262
02:43:15.580 --> 02:43:17.470
<v Speaker 3>I've had my hand up or broken twice.</v>

6263
02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:22.920
<v Speaker 3>Three operations and then a one bad Murcia infection that was far as the scary</v>

6264
02:43:23.021 --> 02:43:23.411
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

6265

<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

6266
02:43:24.120 --> 02:43:24.641
<v Speaker 3>Having mercy.</v>

6267
02:43:24.641 --> 02:43:25.001
<v Speaker 3>Cause you know,</v>

6268
02:43:25.001 --> 02:43:27.940
<v Speaker 3>I ended up in Brazil with a blood infection and I don't think,</v>

6269
02:43:27.941 --> 02:43:28.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's mercy or not,</v>

6270
02:43:28.961 --> 02:43:29.794
<v Speaker 3>but it was in my blood.</v>

6271
02:43:29.890 --> 02:43:30.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

6272
02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:33.390
<v Speaker 3>This infectious still remember when I went to fight Lineker the first time and</v>

<v Speaker 3>I walked into the happen,</v>

6275
02:43:35.260 --> 02:43:40.260
<v Speaker 3>I walked in the back and I took one bite of fruit and then just walk and uh,</v>

6276
02:43:40.570 --> 02:43:40.991
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

02:43:43.391 --> 02:43:44.620
<v Speaker 3>The girl that runs the shows down there,</v>

6280
02:43:45.170 --> 02:43:45.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but she,</v>

6283
02:43:47.351 --> 02:43:47.951
<v Speaker 3>she was just like,</v>

6284
02:43:47.951 --> 02:43:48.970
<v Speaker 3>oh everyone get definitely get out.</v>

6285
02:43:49.030 --> 02:43:50.980
<v Speaker 3>Everyone went out and they just write it right there.</v>

6286
02:43:51.090 --> 02:43:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Hooked me up with diabetes.</v>

6287
02:43:52.060 --> 02:43:52.990
<v Speaker 3>And so did the,</v>

6288

<v Speaker 3>what kind of blood infection was it?</v>

6289
02:43:54.770 --> 02:43:55.603
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>

6290
02:43:55.900 --> 02:43:56.291
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

6291
02:43:56.291 --> 02:43:56.801
<v Speaker 3>I didn't ask.</v>

6292
02:43:56.801 --> 02:43:57.750
<v Speaker 3>How about Danny's me?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Ooh God.</v>

6295
02:43:59.290 --> 02:44:00.310
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knew Danny.</v>

6296
02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:01.211
<v Speaker 3>He did a,</v>

6297
02:44:01.211 --> 02:44:03.430
<v Speaker 3>the last Ebi Ebi five.</v>

6298
02:44:03.460 --> 02:44:05.050
<v Speaker 3>He looked good at to have a good,</v>

6299
02:44:05.051 --> 02:44:06.430
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't train at all for that.</v>

6300
02:44:06.610 --> 02:44:07.510
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knew.</v>

6301
02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:07.931
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6302
02:44:07.931 --> 02:44:08.930
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't going to do it.</v>

6303
02:44:08.931 --> 02:44:09.220
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

6304
02:44:09.220 --> 02:44:12.320
<v Speaker 3>he had Murcia inside his needs training camp.</v>

6305
02:44:12.670 --> 02:44:14.710
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want him to tell people who it was,</v>

6306
02:44:14.711 --> 02:44:17.230
<v Speaker 3>but I put it the picture of his knee up on my Instagram.</v>

6307
02:44:17.410 --> 02:44:20.200
<v Speaker 3>But I'm seeing her fight at Jamie's from a few months ago.</v>

6308
02:44:20.620 --> 02:44:21.100
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

6309
02:44:21.100 --> 02:44:24.490
<v Speaker 3>he was right in the middle of Ebi five training camp.</v>

6310
02:44:24.820 --> 02:44:25.900
<v Speaker 3>And I gave him,</v>

6311
02:44:25.901 --> 02:44:26.231
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

6312
02:44:26.231 --> 02:44:26.591
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

6313
02:44:26.591 --> 02:44:27.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna.</v>

6314
02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:27.873
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna pull you.</v>

6315
02:44:28.270 --> 02:44:28.511
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

6316
02:44:28.511 --> 02:44:29.230
<v Speaker 3>you're not like,</v>

6317
02:44:29.230 --> 02:44:33.940
<v Speaker 3>let's wait until two weeks before the show and we'll see where we're at.</v>

6318
02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:35.710
<v Speaker 3>And that two week mark,</v>

6319
02:44:36.070 --> 02:44:37.120
<v Speaker 3>that's when he started,</v>

6320
02:44:37.180 --> 02:44:38.500
<v Speaker 3>he was able to roll light.</v>

6321
02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:39.011
<v Speaker 3>So we're like,</v>

6322
02:44:39.011 --> 02:44:39.880
<v Speaker 3>you want to go for it?</v>

6323
02:44:39.970 --> 02:44:40.803
<v Speaker 3>You want it.</v>

6324
02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:43.930
<v Speaker 3>There was so many times where it was 100% that he was out,</v>

6325
02:44:43.931 --> 02:44:44.680
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't,</v>

6326
02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:45.170
<v Speaker 3>I just said,</v>

6327
02:44:45.170 --> 02:44:45.910
<v Speaker 3>let's wait.</v>

6328
02:44:45.910 --> 02:44:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what happens.</v>

6329
02:44:47.170 --> 02:44:49.390
<v Speaker 3>Those fucking pictures of his knee,</v>

6330
02:44:49.620 --> 02:44:51.550
<v Speaker 3>but no one knew the fuck that was.</v>

6331
02:44:51.580 --> 02:44:51.911
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6332
02:44:51.911 --> 02:44:52.990
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say who it was.</v>

6333
02:44:53.320 --> 02:44:56.590
<v Speaker 3>I put the pictures up on Instagram because I wanted to alert people to the</v>

6334
02:44:56.591 --> 02:44:58.210
<v Speaker 3>dangers of staph infection.</v>

6335
02:44:58.240 --> 02:44:59.830
<v Speaker 3>Cause a lot of Jujitsu places,</v>

6336
02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:02.380
<v Speaker 3>they don't tell people about staff.</v>

6337
02:45:02.680 --> 02:45:03.710
<v Speaker 3>And so you get like a,</v>

6338
02:45:03.711 --> 02:45:07.030
<v Speaker 3>a bump on your knee and you don't know what the fuck it is and then it gets</v>

6339
02:45:07.031 --> 02:45:08.050
<v Speaker 3>worse and then you don't,</v>

6340
02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:10.690
<v Speaker 3>you ignore it and then it gets to the point where it's systemic.</v>

6341
02:45:10.810 --> 02:45:14.740
<v Speaker 3>If you think you have a pimple or a spider bite and you keep itching something</v>

6342
02:45:14.741 --> 02:45:15.670
<v Speaker 3>and it keeps getting bigger,</v>

6343
02:45:15.700 --> 02:45:16.533
<v Speaker 3>bigger and bigger,</v>

6344
02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:18.220
<v Speaker 3>you might have staff,</v>

6345
02:45:18.221 --> 02:45:21.730
<v Speaker 3>you might have mercy if you'd think there was a spider bite on you on your leg</v>

6346
02:45:21.731 --> 02:45:25.090
<v Speaker 3>or your arm or a pimple that just got infected,</v>

6347
02:45:25.390 --> 02:45:26.440
<v Speaker 3>run to the,</v>

6348
02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:27.473
<v Speaker 3>that's what I,</v>

6349
02:45:27.490 --> 02:45:28.570
<v Speaker 3>Debbie could a tired,</v>

6350
02:45:28.990 --> 02:45:31.240
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a spider bite in my armpit.</v>

6351
02:45:31.330 --> 02:45:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I was wrestling and uh,</v>

6352
02:45:33.190 --> 02:45:35.830
<v Speaker 3>I sent a picture of my coach is a big ass thing and I go,</v>

6353
02:45:35.831 --> 02:45:36.161
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

6354
02:45:36.161 --> 02:45:37.450
<v Speaker 3>I think a spider bite.</v>

6355
02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:38.050
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

6356
02:45:38.050 --> 02:45:39.940
<v Speaker 3>have you been to fucking Africa lately?</v>

6357
02:45:39.941 --> 02:45:41.000
<v Speaker 3>What spider would do that?</v>

6358
02:45:41.001 --> 02:45:41.834
<v Speaker 3>That staff,</v>

6359
02:45:42.010 --> 02:45:45.220
<v Speaker 3>it was like huge to white bubbles and my armpit.</v>

6360
02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:46.841
<v Speaker 3>Where'd you go?</v>

6361
02:45:46.841 --> 02:45:47.674
<v Speaker 3>Africa.</v>

6362
02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:48.753
<v Speaker 3>Where</v>

6363
02:45:50.020 --> 02:45:51.580
<v Speaker 3>the first time I had it was in my knee.</v>

6364
02:45:51.890 --> 02:45:52.720
<v Speaker 3>You fucking,</v>

6365
02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:53.501
<v Speaker 3>a decade ago.</v>

6366
02:45:53.501 --> 02:45:54.210
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

6367
02:45:54.210 --> 02:45:56.350
<v Speaker 3>When Marissa first came out and Mike Gaiman hat and he goes,</v>

6368
02:45:56.351 --> 02:45:56.501
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

6369
02:45:56.501 --> 02:45:57.334
<v Speaker 3>get to the hospital.</v>

6370
02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:00.460
<v Speaker 3>That's Danny's me.</v>

6371
02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:01.430
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

6372
02:46:01.430 --> 02:46:03.880
<v Speaker 3>that was like three weeks before Ebi.</v>

6373
02:46:03.910 --> 02:46:04.900
<v Speaker 3>What a Badass.</v>

6374
02:46:05.080 --> 02:46:05.913
<v Speaker 3>He did him.</v>

6375
02:46:06.830 --> 02:46:07.660
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

6376
02:46:07.660 --> 02:46:08.980
<v Speaker 3>I just had to put that up there.</v>

6377
02:46:09.770 --> 02:46:10.160
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

6378
02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:10.801
<v Speaker 5>Danny pro.</v>

6379
02:46:10.801 --> 02:46:11.810
<v Speaker 5>Coppos Nice.</v>

6380
02:46:11.811 --> 02:46:12.680
<v Speaker 5>Such a nice guy.</v>

6381
02:46:12.681 --> 02:46:15.560
<v Speaker 5>Look at that guy in the hospital for a week.</v>

6382
02:46:15.710 --> 02:46:17.360
<v Speaker 5>He was in the hospital for a week.</v>

6383
02:46:17.361 --> 02:46:20.570
<v Speaker 5>They had a suction machine on his knee all day,</v>

6384
02:46:20.610 --> 02:46:21.850
<v Speaker 5>everyday and machine.</v>

6385
02:46:21.860 --> 02:46:23.150
<v Speaker 5>It's sucked shit</v>

6386
02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:24.073
<v Speaker 1>out of the men.</v>

6387
02:46:24.430 --> 02:46:25.010
<v Speaker 1>His knee.</v>

6388
02:46:25.010 --> 02:46:25.650
<v Speaker 1>That's a bummer.</v>

6389
02:46:25.650 --> 02:46:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6390
02:46:26.090 --> 02:46:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I think Joe Briggs went down from my broken arm.</v>

6391
02:46:29.390 --> 02:46:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6392
02:46:29.780 --> 02:46:30.591
<v Speaker 1>He went down immediately,</v>

6393
02:46:30.591 --> 02:46:31.281
<v Speaker 1>grabbed his arm.</v>

6394
02:46:31.281 --> 02:46:32.114
<v Speaker 1>When he went down,</v>

6395
02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:33.990
<v Speaker 1>he tried to block in the knee with his,</v>

6396
02:46:34.070 --> 02:46:37.010
<v Speaker 1>he blocked the form ruthless Kamozi knees.</v>

6397
02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:39.590
<v Speaker 1>I think he might've broken arm the man good for him.</v>

6398
02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Kenny's Vac can you from the first time Kennedy's back?</v>

6399
02:46:42.891 --> 02:46:43.724
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6400
02:46:44.540 --> 02:46:45.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6401
02:46:45.470 --> 02:46:46.460
<v Speaker 1>That whole situation.</v>

6402
02:46:46.470 --> 02:46:46.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

6403
02:46:46.700 --> 02:46:49.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad he didn't completely lose his job because it's not like Kenny doesn't</v>

6404
02:46:49.941 --> 02:46:50.990
<v Speaker 1>know a lot about MMA,</v>

6405
02:46:51.290 --> 02:46:53.420
<v Speaker 1>but you got to give credit where credit's deserved.</v>

6406
02:46:53.840 --> 02:46:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6407
02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:56.720
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that and now he will know and they'll never do it again.</v>

6408
02:46:56.721 --> 02:46:57.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6409
02:46:57.230 --> 02:46:57.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

6410
02:46:57.450 --> 02:46:58.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm a failure.</v>

6411
02:46:58.100 --> 02:47:00.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of a guy getting a second chance.</v>

6412
02:47:00.530 --> 02:47:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Four five,</v>

6413
02:47:01.851 --> 02:47:02.684
<v Speaker 1>six.</v>

6414
02:47:02.690 --> 02:47:03.261
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

6415
02:47:03.261 --> 02:47:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Six card,</v>

6416
02:47:04.131 --> 02:47:04.964
<v Speaker 1>full power.</v>

6417
02:47:04.990 --> 02:47:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Many times boys hit,</v>

6418
02:47:06.110 --> 02:47:06.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6419
02:47:06.530 --> 02:47:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Ken shamrock fits in the side of the face.</v>

6420
02:47:10.390 --> 02:47:11.223
<v Speaker 1>I just see,</v>

6421
02:47:11.730 --> 02:47:12.561
<v Speaker 1>I think first of all,</v>

6422
02:47:12.561 --> 02:47:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Ken needs a fucking diamond MMA cop.</v>

6423
02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:15.591
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6424
02:47:15.591 --> 02:47:16.161
<v Speaker 1>he needs one of them.</v>

02:47:17.420 --> 02:47:18.290
<v Speaker 1>I wish we had gotten them.</v>

6427
02:47:18.420 --> 02:47:18.781
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

6428
02:47:18.781 --> 02:47:18.940
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

6429
02:47:18.940 --> 02:47:20.220
<v Speaker 5>when they say they say wrestlers,</v>

6430
02:47:20.221 --> 02:47:21.570
<v Speaker 5>no matter what the strategy is.</v>

6431
02:47:21.571 --> 02:47:21.741
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

6432
02:47:21.741 --> 02:47:22.830
<v Speaker 5>if a restaurant wants to stand standing,</v>

6433
02:47:22.831 --> 02:47:25.800
<v Speaker 5>you know his strategy is the standard bag that people say that when,</v>

6434
02:47:25.801 --> 02:47:27.330
<v Speaker 5>when the chaos sets in,</v>

6435
02:47:27.420 --> 02:47:30.690
<v Speaker 5>wrestlers revert to the wrestling and in the chaos they going to show what they</v>

6436
02:47:30.691 --> 02:47:31.441
<v Speaker 5>know they're going to shoot.</v>

6437
02:47:31.441 --> 02:47:32.274
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

6438
02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:35.700
<v Speaker 5>I swear I think Ken reverts to pro wrestling or something.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

6451
02:47:57.080 --> 02:48:00.040
<v Speaker 5>What about that deliberately stopped but not the delay was</v>

6452
02:48:01.740 --> 02:48:03.880
<v Speaker 1>did he get hit in the nuts and he's like this is my way out.</v>

6453
02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making that happen.</v>

6454
02:48:05.830 --> 02:48:06.940
<v Speaker 1>But that's an option.</v>

6455
02:48:07.630 --> 02:48:08.680
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think that at all.</v>

6456
02:48:08.681 --> 02:48:09.514
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

6457
02:48:10.810 --> 02:48:14.530
<v Speaker 1>I thought well add to see the replay to see that he got kicked in the nuts cause</v>

6458
02:48:14.531 --> 02:48:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Smith's seemed to be incredulous.</v>

6459
02:48:15.971 --> 02:48:18.760
<v Speaker 1>At first he was saying that it was a shot to the head and then maybe can have</v>

6460
02:48:18.761 --> 02:48:19.541
<v Speaker 1>gotten knocked out.</v>

6461
02:48:19.541 --> 02:48:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in thought he got hit in the nuts or something.</v>

6462
02:48:21.550 --> 02:48:24.820
<v Speaker 1>But when they showed it again they went one step before you see it.</v>

6463
02:48:24.821 --> 02:48:25.570
<v Speaker 1>It's clear.</v>

6464
02:48:25.570 --> 02:48:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Definitely it goes right to the nuts and the way he's adjusting it.</v>

6465
02:48:28.660 --> 02:48:30.730
<v Speaker 1>That sounds to me like you didn't have a good cup.</v>

6466
02:48:30.850 --> 02:48:34.930
<v Speaker 1>You know if you have a tie steel cup or if you have a real good like a diamond</v>

6467
02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:36.400
<v Speaker 1>and make compression shorts cup,</v>

6468
02:48:36.610 --> 02:48:40.630
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't affect you that bad cause it wasn't like Melvin Manhoef was neat.</v>

6469
02:48:40.631 --> 02:48:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean you know what I'm saying</v>

6470
02:48:42.280 --> 02:48:43.660
<v Speaker 5>and and exactly.</v>

6471
02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:44.380
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

6472
02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:46.900
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying I've seen horse nut shots where guys are like,</v>

6473
02:48:46.901 --> 02:48:47.621
<v Speaker 5>Damn Bro.</v>

6474
02:48:47.621 --> 02:48:48.454
<v Speaker 5>I'm like hold up,</v>

6475
02:48:48.550 --> 02:48:49.930
<v Speaker 5>hold up five minutes.</v>

6476
02:48:49.960 --> 02:48:52.270
<v Speaker 5>He's 52 50 those nuts hang low.</v>

6477
02:48:52.300 --> 02:48:53.230
<v Speaker 5>Might've been real bad.</v>

6478
02:48:54.130 --> 02:48:57.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying actually I'm under the cup.</v>

6479
02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:00.560
<v Speaker 5>They were hanging on the outside</v>

6480
02:49:03.470 --> 02:49:07.180
<v Speaker 5>the ball and there's a five second delay.</v>

6481
02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:07.680
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

6482
02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:09.300
<v Speaker 5>He's always is a way that was an odd,</v>

6483
02:49:09.330 --> 02:49:09.481
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

6484
02:49:09.481 --> 02:49:10.770
<v Speaker 5>that's not odd.</v>

6485
02:49:10.771 --> 02:49:11.690
<v Speaker 5>But if you don't think that was on,</v>

6486
02:49:11.691 --> 02:49:12.540
<v Speaker 5>I believe you guys,</v>

6487
02:49:12.541 --> 02:49:15.240
<v Speaker 5>you guys are the second why is the delay is automatic.</v>

6488
02:49:15.241 --> 02:49:15.631
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6489
02:49:15.631 --> 02:49:16.261
<v Speaker 5>Why is that?</v>

6490
02:49:16.261 --> 02:49:16.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

6491
02:49:16.980 --> 02:49:18.960
<v Speaker 5>The brains and the main,</v>

6492
02:49:19.170 --> 02:49:21.150
<v Speaker 5>when a guy gets hit in the balls and there's a break,</v>

6493
02:49:21.180 --> 02:49:23.160
<v Speaker 5>it's the hit in the balls and he goes boom.</v>

6494
02:49:23.310 --> 02:49:25.470
<v Speaker 5>In the break there's never a hit in the balls.</v>

6495
02:49:28.060 --> 02:49:28.893
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

6496
02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:32.940
<v Speaker 5>Watch it again to see that in heaven when you watch it again.</v>

6497
02:49:32.941 --> 02:49:34.290
<v Speaker 5>Let's take a look at it again cause this is kind of,</v>

6498
02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:36.600
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of a crazy delay as long.</v>

6499
02:49:36.780 --> 02:49:37.021
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6500
02:49:37.021 --> 02:49:38.100
<v Speaker 5>We never see that you,</v>

6501
02:49:38.110 --> 02:49:38.920
<v Speaker 5>you get hit in the balls.</v>

6502
02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:39.250
<v Speaker 5>The guy goes,</v>

6503
02:49:39.250 --> 02:49:39.990
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

6504
02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:41.100
<v Speaker 5>Eddie has good point.</v>

6505
02:49:41.101 --> 02:49:43.050
<v Speaker 5>We never seen a 50 year old get hit in the nuts.</v>

6506
02:49:43.051 --> 02:49:44.760
<v Speaker 5>Boom and they're exchanging</v>

6507
02:49:46.370 --> 02:49:46.901
<v Speaker 5>and hoists hit.</v>

6508
02:49:46.901 --> 02:49:48.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm good on the Chin though.</v>

6509
02:49:48.030 --> 02:49:50.130
<v Speaker 5>The one that Shannon was good to take downs.</v>

6510
02:49:50.131 --> 02:49:51.780
<v Speaker 5>Good Hammer fist is good.</v>

6511
02:49:51.810 --> 02:49:52.291
<v Speaker 5>Oh wait a minute.</v>

6512
02:49:52.291 --> 02:49:53.130
<v Speaker 5>Now from that angle.</v>

6513
02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:55.110
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he was hoping his calls this.</v>

6514
02:49:55.140 --> 02:49:55.700
<v Speaker 5>He was definitely,</v>

6515
02:49:55.700 --> 02:49:56.910
<v Speaker 5>he was holding his ball,</v>

6516
02:49:56.911 --> 02:50:00.360
<v Speaker 5>but that's a legit knocked down and the need of the faces legit.</v>

6517
02:50:00.570 --> 02:50:01.381
<v Speaker 5>The knee is before.</v>

6518
02:50:01.381 --> 02:50:01.531
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

6519
02:50:01.531 --> 02:50:02.480
<v Speaker 5>this is what you're talking about.</v>

6520
02:50:02.490 --> 02:50:04.440
<v Speaker 5>This seems kind of acted out.</v>

6521
02:50:04.441 --> 02:50:05.274
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute,</v>

6522
02:50:05.640 --> 02:50:06.570
<v Speaker 5>Paul shine,</v>

6523
02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:08.790
<v Speaker 5>but watch this right to the chin.</v>

6524
02:50:08.791 --> 02:50:09.990
<v Speaker 5>Watch how long it takes.</v>

6525
02:50:10.170 --> 02:50:10.440
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

6526
02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:11.390
<v Speaker 5>we need to see the whole thing.</v>

6527
02:50:11.410 --> 02:50:12.560
<v Speaker 5>Show the need of the chin.</v>

6528
02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:14.850
<v Speaker 5>He did take them down.</v>

6529
02:50:14.851 --> 02:50:17.640
<v Speaker 5>Now that I see it did look like he was complaining about the balls.</v>

6530
02:50:17.700 --> 02:50:19.650
<v Speaker 5>Once the fight got to the ground.</v>

6531
02:50:19.651 --> 02:50:20.610
<v Speaker 5>Go way back Jamie.</v>

6532
02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:21.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm starting to look.</v>

6533
02:50:21.910 --> 02:50:22.591
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be over.</v>

6534
02:50:22.591 --> 02:50:23.580
<v Speaker 5>You're going to try and sell it.</v>

6535
02:50:23.610 --> 02:50:24.390
<v Speaker 5>Watch it here.</v>

6536
02:50:24.390 --> 02:50:25.223
<v Speaker 5>Watching her.</v>

6537
02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:26.670
<v Speaker 5>But why would he think it was over?</v>

6538
02:50:26.671 --> 02:50:27.630
<v Speaker 5>Just cause it got taken down here.</v>

6539
02:50:27.631 --> 02:50:28.590
<v Speaker 5>We're going to watch the whole fight.</v>

6540
02:50:28.650 --> 02:50:29.483
<v Speaker 5>Here it goes.</v>

6541
02:50:31.320 --> 02:50:31.531
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

6542
02:50:31.531 --> 02:50:32.910
<v Speaker 5>where's the ball shot?</v>

6543
02:50:33.090 --> 02:50:33.923
<v Speaker 5>Right there.</v>

6544
02:50:34.260 --> 02:50:34.980
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>

6545
02:50:34.980 --> 02:50:35.490
<v Speaker 5>That was it.</v>

6546
02:50:35.490 --> 02:50:36.150
<v Speaker 5>That was it.</v>

6547
02:50:36.150 --> 02:50:38.850
<v Speaker 5>And they have long balls and that's the one on the chin.</v>

6548
02:50:39.320 --> 02:50:40.890
<v Speaker 5>The right knee holding his balls as he hurt.</v>

6549
02:50:40.891 --> 02:50:41.490
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

6550
02:50:41.490 --> 02:50:43.440
<v Speaker 5>He's holding his well from the face shot.</v>

6551
02:50:43.710 --> 02:50:43.861
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

6552
02:50:43.861 --> 02:50:48.861
<v Speaker 5>he definitely got dropped face hitting the depth of nuts and face,</v>

6553
02:50:49.350 --> 02:50:51.000
<v Speaker 5>but he did yell and say,</v>

6554
02:50:51.001 --> 02:50:51.990
<v Speaker 5>you hit me in the balls.</v>

6555
02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:53.160
<v Speaker 5>There should be a rematch then.</v>

6556
02:50:53.790 --> 02:50:54.421
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

6557
02:50:54.421 --> 02:50:54.980
<v Speaker 5>we got to it.</v>

6558
02:50:54.980 --> 02:50:59.700
<v Speaker 5>I like sad and Kimball enough controversy in this to have an immediate rematch.</v>

6559
02:51:00.330 --> 02:51:04.500
<v Speaker 5>Let's run it back a go fund me this for everybody donates a dollar to make sure</v>

6560
02:51:04.890 --> 02:51:05.910
<v Speaker 5>we're never does this again.</v>

6561
02:51:06.870 --> 02:51:09.060
<v Speaker 5>I'll text rates show tonight after this.</v>

6562
02:51:09.510 --> 02:51:10.620
<v Speaker 5>And Ken was a he.</v>

6563
02:51:10.790 --> 02:51:15.790
<v Speaker 5>He sort of recovered his composure against 50 year olds fighting you.</v>

6564
02:51:16.441 --> 02:51:17.790
<v Speaker 5>You guys have something against that.</v>

6565
02:51:17.970 --> 02:51:18.803
<v Speaker 5>What's wrong with it?</v>

6566
02:51:20.520 --> 02:51:22.600
<v Speaker 5>As long as they're both 50 I don't have a problem with it.</v>

6567
02:51:23.570 --> 02:51:27.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't enjoy it the same age where you know you're not dealing with 55 year</v>

6568
02:51:27.361 --> 02:51:28.021
<v Speaker 5>olds out there,</v>

6569
02:51:28.021 --> 02:51:28.600
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

6570
02:51:28.600 --> 02:51:30.240
<v Speaker 5>but 55 was the shit.</v>

6571
02:51:30.241 --> 02:51:30.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm not watching.</v>

6572
02:51:30.890 --> 02:51:33.240
<v Speaker 5>I want to see Chuck Norris at 55 fight and rumble.</v>

6573
02:51:34.310 --> 02:51:34.831
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

6574
02:51:34.831 --> 02:51:36.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't see 55 year olds fight,</v>

6575
02:51:36.301 --> 02:51:37.134
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

6576
02:51:37.350 --> 02:51:39.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to go up a t and why not?</v>

6577
02:51:39.211 --> 02:51:40.044
<v Speaker 5>It's very reasonable.</v>

6578
02:51:40.440 --> 02:51:41.273
<v Speaker 5>Very reasonable.</v>

6579
02:51:41.310 --> 02:51:42.450
<v Speaker 5>Especially true legends.</v>

6580
02:51:42.451 --> 02:51:43.950
<v Speaker 5>I can remember him as the legends.</v>

6581
02:51:43.980 --> 02:51:45.570
<v Speaker 5>I don't like seeing six year old fights either.</v>

6582
02:51:45.900 --> 02:51:46.111
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

6583
02:51:46.111 --> 02:51:46.501

6586
02:51:48.100 --> 02:51:49.560
<v Speaker 5>Taekwondo Kid's head kicking each other.</v>

6587
02:51:49.561 --> 02:51:51.120
<v Speaker 5>I don't see that that counts.</v>

6588
02:51:51.930 --> 02:51:52.770
<v Speaker 5>I don't let my,</v>

6589
02:51:52.771 --> 02:51:54.170
<v Speaker 5>I run a kids program at a Yamas.</v>

6590
02:51:54.300 --> 02:51:54.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6591
02:51:54.660 --> 02:51:59.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't let them spark like I don't want to see Larry Bird's part of the body to</v>

6592
02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:00.060
<v Speaker 5>the body.</v>

6593
02:52:00.060 --> 02:52:02.530
<v Speaker 5>Kind of touch out of that and play like Taika is and was touched.</v>

6594
02:52:03.780 --> 02:52:04.710
<v Speaker 5>But Tyrone Woodley.</v>

6595
02:52:04.720 --> 02:52:05.800
<v Speaker 5>What a strong beard game.</v>

6596
02:52:06.490 --> 02:52:08.000
<v Speaker 1>No respect for that bit again.</v>

6597
02:52:08.650 --> 02:52:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Oregon's,</v>

6598
02:52:09.310 --> 02:52:10.210
<v Speaker 1>he's in a weird spot,</v>

6599
02:52:10.211 --> 02:52:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

6600
02:52:10.660 --> 02:52:11.930
<v Speaker 1>What lives in a weird spot in the know?</v>

6601
02:52:11.940 --> 02:52:13.930
<v Speaker 1>He deserves a title shot sort of,</v>

6602
02:52:13.931 --> 02:52:15.460
<v Speaker 1>but no one wants to out shined him.</v>

6603
02:52:15.610 --> 02:52:16.241
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

6604
02:52:16.241 --> 02:52:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Daily.</v>

6605
02:52:16.750 --> 02:52:19.780
<v Speaker 1>So now everyone's demand in one or boy and the way the UFC works.</v>

6606
02:52:19.840 --> 02:52:20.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6607
02:52:20.141 --> 02:52:22.960
<v Speaker 1>but I think weirdly still in the title shot is he will,</v>

6608
02:52:22.961 --> 02:52:24.100
<v Speaker 1>if it's going to go Rory,</v>

6609
02:52:24.101 --> 02:52:25.270
<v Speaker 1>and it might not,</v>

6610
02:52:25.540 --> 02:52:26.351
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it is,</v>

6611
02:52:26.351 --> 02:52:28.430
<v Speaker 1>but let's say they do Rory first.</v>

6612
02:52:28.440 --> 02:52:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy Woodley would have to get the title shot.</v>

6613
02:52:30.760 --> 02:52:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6614
02:52:31.510 --> 02:52:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Or Don.</v>

6615
02:52:32.351 --> 02:52:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Don.</v>

6616
02:52:32.560 --> 02:52:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Don Don.</v>

6617
02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Don Connor wins quick against Osan Joseph and says Robby.</v>

6618
02:52:37.721 --> 02:52:38.554
<v Speaker 1>Laura,</v>

6619
02:52:39.070 --> 02:52:40.810
<v Speaker 1>if could any fucking Pete trumps</v>

6620
02:52:43.850 --> 02:52:46.180
<v Speaker 1>trumps then that's the fight.</v>

6621
02:52:46.630 --> 02:52:48.130
<v Speaker 1>We're all fucked because that's the fight.</v>

6622
02:52:48.131 --> 02:52:48.861
<v Speaker 1>If he beats though,</v>

6623
02:52:48.861 --> 02:52:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Sign Joseph challenges lower th the world ends.</v>

6624
02:52:52.150 --> 02:52:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6625
02:52:52.660 --> 02:52:53.860
<v Speaker 1>No one watches anything.</v>

6626
02:52:53.890 --> 02:52:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Everything goes down.</v>

6627
02:52:55.030 --> 02:52:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Every show on television says we're just going to take the night off.</v>

6628
02:52:59.300 --> 02:53:01.180
<v Speaker 1>There's no need for anything other than this.</v>

6629
02:53:01.181 --> 02:53:05.560
<v Speaker 1>And we would throw some children's shows on Nickelodeon and have to have it on</v>

6630
02:53:05.561 --> 02:53:06.394
<v Speaker 1>the moon.</v>

6631
02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:08.913
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson,</v>

6632
02:53:09.620 --> 02:53:10.453
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers,</v>

6633
02:53:11.470 --> 02:53:12.101
<v Speaker 1>every channel,</v>

6634
02:53:12.101 --> 02:53:13.840
<v Speaker 1>whenever he runs on Gilligan's island,</v>

6635
02:53:14.170 --> 02:53:14.700
<v Speaker 1>if he,</v>

6636
02:53:14.700 --> 02:53:15.070
<v Speaker 1>if so,</v>

6637
02:53:15.070 --> 02:53:18.430
<v Speaker 1>if he beat Dos Anjos and then he beats Robbie Lawler's either greatest fighter</v>

6638
02:53:18.431 --> 02:53:19.264
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>

6639
02:53:20.320 --> 02:53:22.780
<v Speaker 1>If he beats those [inaudible] he's in the running to be the greatest hour.</v>

6640
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Of course he's in the running,</v>

6641
02:53:24.580 --> 02:53:25.413
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6642
02:53:25.540 --> 02:53:25.900
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

6643
02:53:25.900 --> 02:53:26.890
<v Speaker 1>I say the greatest ever.</v>

6644
02:53:26.891 --> 02:53:27.970
<v Speaker 1>A little bit too liberally.</v>

6645
02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:28.211
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

6646
02:53:28.211 --> 02:53:28.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

6647
02:53:28.510 --> 02:53:29.320
<v Speaker 1>I'll be honest.</v>

6648
02:53:29.320 --> 02:53:30.153
<v Speaker 1>I know I do,</v>

6649
02:53:30.190 --> 02:53:35.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's tough to find a guy who's even close to as exciting in what he's</v>

6650
02:53:35.321 --> 02:53:36.550
<v Speaker 1>attempting to accomplishment.</v>

6651
02:53:36.760 --> 02:53:37.870
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] attempt to accomplish.</v>

6652
02:53:37.871 --> 02:53:41.830
<v Speaker 1>It's easy when you go back like after the dust has settled and say,</v>

6653
02:53:41.831 --> 02:53:42.610
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

6654
02:53:42.610 --> 02:53:42.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6655
02:53:42.911 --> 02:53:45.520
<v Speaker 1>you gotta look at Fader or like fate or was the greatest ever?</v>

6656
02:53:46.030 --> 02:53:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6657
02:53:46.780 --> 02:53:50.140
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the greatest ever at that time for sure.</v>

6658
02:53:50.260 --> 02:53:52.150
<v Speaker 1>I think Anderson move,</v>

6659
02:53:52.170 --> 02:53:54.200
<v Speaker 1>if I look at like movements and what he's doing,</v>

6660
02:53:54.230 --> 02:53:57.760
<v Speaker 1>I think I kind of give the edge to Anderson but I can see the argument.</v>

6661
02:53:58.150 --> 02:54:01.240
<v Speaker 1>But if Connor can beat dos Anjos and he's starches him,</v>

6662
02:54:01.720 --> 02:54:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any argument,</v>

6663
02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:06.340
<v Speaker 1>especially where the level of the games since ever been,</v>

6664
02:54:06.370 --> 02:54:10.060
<v Speaker 1>especially since we have already seen fate or go down and get knocked the fuck</v>

6665
02:54:10.061 --> 02:54:10.601
<v Speaker 1>out a few times.</v>

6666
02:54:10.601 --> 02:54:11.434
<v Speaker 1>Same.</v>

6667
02:54:11.840 --> 02:54:12.461
<v Speaker 1>They've been gone.</v>

6668
02:54:12.461 --> 02:54:13.630
<v Speaker 1>We've already seen them go down.</v>

6669
02:54:13.631 --> 02:54:14.800
<v Speaker 1>We haven't seen Conor go down,</v>

6670
02:54:14.801 --> 02:54:17.080
<v Speaker 1>so you got to give the edge to Connor so far.</v>

6671
02:54:17.110 --> 02:54:17.681
<v Speaker 1>Sort of.</v>

6672
02:54:17.681 --> 02:54:20.920
<v Speaker 1>But we haven't seen Conor fight the kind of guys that fade or fought in its</v>

6673
02:54:20.921 --> 02:54:21.580
<v Speaker 1>prime,</v>

6674
02:54:21.580 --> 02:54:22.570
<v Speaker 1>walked down cro,</v>

6675
02:54:22.571 --> 02:54:22.961
<v Speaker 1>cop,</v>

6676
02:54:22.961 --> 02:54:23.770
<v Speaker 1>remember that?</v>

6677
02:54:23.770 --> 02:54:26.260
<v Speaker 1>You know the random in one of the random one dimensional guy,</v>

6678
02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:29.830
<v Speaker 1>a lot of one dimensional guy that's common is fighting dub trust of the best and</v>

6679
02:54:29.831 --> 02:54:30.880
<v Speaker 1>they're all good at everything.</v>

6680
02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:32.260
<v Speaker 1>It was just five months.</v>

6681
02:54:32.290 --> 02:54:33.490
<v Speaker 1>It was just a different time.</v>

6682
02:54:34.540 --> 02:54:35.500
<v Speaker 1>It's just not their fault.</v>

6683
02:54:35.501 --> 02:54:37.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying if Connor were to win three belts,</v>

6684
02:54:37.931 --> 02:54:39.610
<v Speaker 1>he's by far the best hands down</v>

6685
02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Mackenzie dern versus Paige vanzant right there.</v>

6686
02:54:45.010 --> 02:54:48.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a guy who really didn't believe we're looking at Cody Garbrandt and what's</v>

6687
02:54:48.701 --> 02:54:49.100
<v Speaker 1>the guy's name?</v>

6688
02:54:49.100 --> 02:54:49.933
<v Speaker 1>Tacchino.</v>

6689
02:54:50.160 --> 02:54:50.261
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6690
02:54:50.261 --> 02:54:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Gusto Mendez.</v>

6691
02:54:51.310 --> 02:54:56.310
<v Speaker 1>He's just doesn't have the stand up to stand with a vicious nasty boxer for a</v>

6692
02:54:56.681 --> 02:54:57.251
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

6693
02:54:57.251 --> 02:54:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6694
02:54:57.590 --> 02:54:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Garb.</v>

6695
02:54:57.940 --> 02:54:58.773
<v Speaker 1>Ranking crack.</v>

6696
02:54:58.830 --> 02:54:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6697
02:54:59.140 --> 02:55:00.520
<v Speaker 1>He's got really good timing.</v>

6698
02:55:00.790 --> 02:55:01.061
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

6699
02:55:01.061 --> 02:55:03.010
<v Speaker 1>he's real confident with his striking and he's just,</v>

6700
02:55:03.020 --> 02:55:03.820
<v Speaker 1>he just outshone.</v>

6701
02:55:03.820 --> 02:55:05.740
<v Speaker 1>What do you guys think of Anderson Silva Bisbee.</v>

6702
02:55:05.810 --> 02:55:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Is that next week?</v>

6703
02:55:06.680 --> 02:55:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

6704
02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Who's in town?</v>

6705
02:55:08.030 --> 02:55:08.751
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of town,</v>

6706
02:55:08.751 --> 02:55:09.720
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately son.</v>

6707
02:55:10.580 --> 02:55:11.413
<v Speaker 1>I'll be here.</v>

6708
02:55:11.530 --> 02:55:12.680
<v Speaker 1>How dare you have another.</v>

6709
02:55:12.681 --> 02:55:13.770
<v Speaker 1>So wish I didn't,</v>

6710
02:55:13.820 --> 02:55:14.653
<v Speaker 1>what day is that?</v>

6711
02:55:14.960 --> 02:55:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Saturday.</v>

6712
02:55:15.380 --> 02:55:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6713
02:55:15.860 --> 02:55:19.400
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting fight though at this point and Anderson's life because</v>

6714
02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:20.920
<v Speaker 1>he's a happen though.</v>

6715
02:55:21.210 --> 02:55:25.010
<v Speaker 1>It depends what Anderson campaigns on how much Bisbing can get in his head.</v>

6716
02:55:25.250 --> 02:55:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Bisbing talks mad shit.</v>

6717
02:55:27.560 --> 02:55:29.590
<v Speaker 1>He's already been mocking them about my background.</v>

6718
02:55:30.250 --> 02:55:31.083
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

6719
02:55:31.130 --> 02:55:31.341
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

6720
02:55:31.341 --> 02:55:33.410
<v Speaker 1>you understand that a hard time pulling the trigger against Nick Diaz.</v>

6721
02:55:33.470 --> 02:55:34.520
<v Speaker 1>I think Bisbing beats him.</v>

6722
02:55:34.740 --> 02:55:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Do even a decision.</v>

6723
02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

6724
02:55:36.650 --> 02:55:39.890
<v Speaker 1>And he started crying after he broke down crying after and then with all this</v>

6725
02:55:39.891 --> 02:55:40.790
<v Speaker 1>shit that's gone on,</v>

6726
02:55:40.791 --> 02:55:41.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're the,</v>

6727
02:55:41.450 --> 02:55:43.430
<v Speaker 1>you know what the x factors here.</v>

6728
02:55:43.700 --> 02:55:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Brisbane's left eye and against South Palsy gets fucking kicks his right</v>

6729
02:55:48.491 --> 02:55:48.591
<v Speaker 1>eye.</v>

6730
02:55:48.591 --> 02:55:49.101
<v Speaker 1>It's just right.</v>

6731
02:55:49.101 --> 02:55:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

6732
02:55:49.550 --> 02:55:52.330
<v Speaker 1>And get South Palsy eats fucking left kicks in the left hand.</v>

6733
02:55:52.350 --> 02:55:52.790
<v Speaker 1>It could.</v>

6734
02:55:52.790 --> 02:55:55.050
<v Speaker 1>That could be a factor for sure factor.</v>

6735
02:55:55.070 --> 02:55:57.050
<v Speaker 1>You know another factor it could be is fighting in England.</v>

6736
02:55:57.710 --> 02:55:58.750
<v Speaker 1>He's never lost an English.</v>

6737
02:55:58.760 --> 02:55:59.930
<v Speaker 1>So he's an animal in England.</v>

6738
02:55:59.931 --> 02:56:01.370
<v Speaker 1>They fucking little love him.</v>

6739
02:56:01.550 --> 02:56:03.410
<v Speaker 1>There's very few places where he goes,</v>

6740
02:56:03.411 --> 02:56:04.880
<v Speaker 1>where he gets that kind of rhino applause.</v>

6741
02:56:05.090 --> 02:56:05.911
<v Speaker 1>When he goes to America,</v>

6742
02:56:05.911 --> 02:56:07.160
<v Speaker 1>he gets booed all time.</v>

6743
02:56:07.370 --> 02:56:08.030
<v Speaker 1>You know Pete,</v>

6744
02:56:08.030 --> 02:56:09.000
<v Speaker 1>don't give him a hard time.</v>

6745
02:56:09.410 --> 02:56:09.681
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

6746
02:56:09.681 --> 02:56:10.550
<v Speaker 1>But in England,</v>

6747
02:56:10.551 --> 02:56:10.821
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

6748

6751
02:56:15.231 --> 02:56:16.070
<v Speaker 1>When he gets out there,</v>

6752
02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:16.280
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

6754
02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:19.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a good fight on bond.</v>

6755
02:56:19.830 --> 02:56:22.310
<v Speaker 1>Man knows the law and he's like,</v>

6758
02:56:28.581 --> 02:56:30.320
<v Speaker 1>He's fought everybody.</v>

6759
02:56:30.321 --> 02:56:31.820
<v Speaker 1>He's only lost a few guys.</v>

6760
02:56:32.510 --> 02:56:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Most are p and he's like,</v>

6761
02:56:34.550 --> 02:56:36.050
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't lose his enthusiasm.</v>

6762
02:56:36.210 --> 02:56:37.610
<v Speaker 1>It keeps getting better and better.</v>

6763
02:56:37.820 --> 02:56:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Little by little,</v>

6764
02:56:38.691 --> 02:56:39.950
<v Speaker 1>each fight and his,</v>

6765
02:56:40.010 --> 02:56:41.360
<v Speaker 1>his mental toughness.</v>

6766
02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:42.433
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

6767
02:56:42.680 --> 02:56:44.240
<v Speaker 1>I've never trained with a new one like him.</v>

6768
02:56:44.750 --> 02:56:45.411
<v Speaker 1>When he fights,</v>

6769
02:56:45.411 --> 02:56:47.580
<v Speaker 1>he says the bathroom away way.</v>

6770
02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:48.740
<v Speaker 1>When he drills,</v>

6771
02:56:48.770 --> 02:56:50.690
<v Speaker 1>he's going full speed drilling.</v>

6772
02:56:50.720 --> 02:56:50.991
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

6773
02:56:50.991 --> 02:56:51.651
<v Speaker 1>Just nonstop,</v>

6774
02:56:51.651 --> 02:56:52.910
<v Speaker 1>not moving nonstop.</v>

6775
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:53.651
<v Speaker 1>Crazy card.</v>

6776
02:56:53.651 --> 02:56:54.150
<v Speaker 1>It's red.</v>

6777
02:56:54.150 --> 02:56:55.190
<v Speaker 1>His cardio is resting.</v>

6778
02:56:55.191 --> 02:56:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Heart rate's 34 beats a minute too.</v>

6779
02:56:56.900 --> 02:56:57.830
<v Speaker 1>He's like a hummingbird.</v>

6780
02:56:57.831 --> 02:57:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anything like incredible wearing guys out.</v>

6781
02:57:00.051 --> 02:57:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Just just grilling.</v>

6782
02:57:01.420 --> 02:57:05.420
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think it is that it kept him from beating like all the best guys?</v>

6783
02:57:05.990 --> 02:57:07.150
<v Speaker 1>There's just something this,</v>

6784
02:57:07.170 --> 02:57:08.270
<v Speaker 1>that it factor.</v>

6785
02:57:08.300 --> 02:57:09.110
<v Speaker 1>He got,</v>

6786
02:57:09.110 --> 02:57:10.580
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any knockout power.</v>

6787
02:57:10.730 --> 02:57:11.780
<v Speaker 1>He's good at everything,</v>

6788
02:57:11.781 --> 02:57:14.390
<v Speaker 1>but he's not great road told me he hits hard.</v>

6789
02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:16.940
<v Speaker 1>He said he holds the pad for me cause I all anybody to tell you this guy doesn't</v>

6790
02:57:16.941 --> 02:57:17.370
<v Speaker 1>hit hard.</v>

6791
02:57:17.370 --> 02:57:20.660
<v Speaker 1>That's his coach said that they stopped the fight.</v>

6792
02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:21.530
<v Speaker 1>They based it off.</v>

6793
02:57:21.530 --> 02:57:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah the guys he stopped.</v>

6794
02:57:23.331 --> 02:57:28.331
<v Speaker 1>He stopped like Lee from like a barrage of suddenly stopped a fucking Jorge</v>

6795
02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Rivera.</v>

6796
02:57:29.290 --> 02:57:30.123
<v Speaker 1>Jorge,</v>

6797
02:57:30.780 --> 02:57:34.010
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about like Miller striped tail power?</v>

6798
02:57:34.100 --> 02:57:34.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6799
02:57:34.610 --> 02:57:35.030
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

6800
02:57:35.030 --> 02:57:35.960
<v Speaker 1>It's just not,</v>

6801
02:57:36.020 --> 02:57:36.920
<v Speaker 1>there's just something there.</v>

6802
02:57:36.950 --> 02:57:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Not that kind of fighter.</v>

6803
02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Different kinds of great meant middleweight domains don't want to fight that</v>

6804
02:57:41.721 --> 02:57:41.871
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

6805
02:57:41.871 --> 02:57:42.950
<v Speaker 1>He's the best.</v>

6806
02:57:42.951 --> 02:57:44.030
<v Speaker 1>He's lost some of the best.</v>

6807
02:57:44.060 --> 02:57:47.400
<v Speaker 1>He's an animal as one of the reasons why it was so impressively Rockhold handled</v>

6808
02:57:47.401 --> 02:57:47.630
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

6809
02:57:47.630 --> 02:57:48.463
<v Speaker 1>Ooh Jeez.</v>

6810
02:57:50.060 --> 02:57:52.470
<v Speaker 1>One arm GTN ever in the UFC.</v>

6811
02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:54.890
<v Speaker 1>I think what set it up that huge,</v>

6812
02:57:54.920 --> 02:57:55.520
<v Speaker 1>that head kick.</v>

6813
02:57:55.520 --> 02:57:59.510
<v Speaker 1>It's well that his left side is very powerful and it's so long that you have to</v>

6814
02:57:59.511 --> 02:58:02.130
<v Speaker 1>kind of stay in his kicking range in order to try to close</v>

6815
02:58:02.130 --> 02:58:02.590
<v Speaker 3>the distance,</v>

6816
02:58:02.590 --> 02:58:05.880
<v Speaker 3>get to punching range and that left kick is so powerful.</v>

6817
02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:09.420
<v Speaker 3>You want to hold that you all pads for Rockhold when he's throwing that left</v>

6818
02:58:09.421 --> 02:58:09.810
<v Speaker 3>kick.</v>

6819
02:58:09.810 --> 02:58:10.411
<v Speaker 3>If I'm answering.</v>

6820
02:58:10.411 --> 02:58:10.841
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

6821
02:58:10.841 --> 02:58:11.181
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

6822
02:58:11.181 --> 02:58:14.350
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm South Pole and I'm fucking attacking that ride.</v>

6823
02:58:14.380 --> 02:58:17.820
<v Speaker 3>I talked to Javier Mendez about holding pads for Rockhold.</v>

6824
02:58:18.660 --> 02:58:19.141
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

6825
02:58:19.141 --> 02:58:21.000
<v Speaker 3>You were see videos of him kicking the pads.</v>

6826
02:58:21.380 --> 02:58:22.820
<v Speaker 3>He's terrifying his,</v>

6827
02:58:22.821 --> 02:58:26.280
<v Speaker 3>it was giving you a fine Luke lukewarm kicking the type ads to it.</v>

6828
02:58:26.281 --> 02:58:26.451
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

6829
02:58:26.451 --> 02:58:29.520
<v Speaker 3>he has so much length and torque.</v>

6830
02:58:29.760 --> 02:58:30.121
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6831
02:58:30.121 --> 02:58:32.670
<v Speaker 3>like I think the scariest guy I ever saw kicked the pads.</v>

6832
02:58:32.671 --> 02:58:34.530
<v Speaker 3>His manhood man to this day.</v>

6833
02:58:34.531 --> 02:58:35.370
<v Speaker 3>Is that a curious guy?</v>

6834
02:58:36.640 --> 02:58:36.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6835
02:58:36.840 --> 02:58:37.890
<v Speaker 3>Pedro Huizar hits back.</v>

6836
02:58:38.010 --> 02:58:39.210
<v Speaker 3>I've seen him hit a bag really hard,</v>

6837
02:58:39.211 --> 02:58:40.440
<v Speaker 3>but man who is way faster,</v>

6838

<v Speaker 3>more explosive,</v>

6839
02:58:41.191 --> 02:58:41.791

6888
02:59:54.730 --> 02:59:59.620
<v Speaker 3>It's not smart to go with shoes all at ou because I don't ever want to go with</v>

6897
03:00:09.971 --> 03:00:10.720
<v Speaker 3>It's a little different.</v>

6898
03:00:10.720 --> 03:00:12.370
<v Speaker 3>That's why I was asking that pressure's gone.</v>

03:00:49.300 --> 03:00:51.810
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean it doesn't diminish him at all.</v>

6923
03:00:53.410 --> 03:00:54.940
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the best of all time.</v>

03:00:55.631 --> 03:00:56.750
<v Speaker 3>Especially submission artists.</v>

6926
03:00:57.490 --> 03:00:57.971
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember.</v>

6927
03:00:57.971 --> 03:00:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6928
03:00:58.310 --> 03:00:59.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember shot in,</v>

6929
03:00:59.800 --> 03:00:59.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't</v>

6930
03:00:59.980 --> 03:01:01.870
<v Speaker 1>remember exactly what the transition was,</v>

6931
03:01:01.871 --> 03:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>but that is apparently Rothwell's shit.</v>

6932
03:01:04.360 --> 03:01:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6933
03:01:04.660 --> 03:01:07.870
<v Speaker 1>If Rothwell gets a hold of your neck from that 10 finger gay teen position,</v>

6934
03:01:07.871 --> 03:01:11.140
<v Speaker 1>he just tucks that bitch and tight and chokes the fuck out of you.</v>

6935
03:01:11.350 --> 03:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying if you gave me a hundred justice,</v>

6936
03:01:13.400 --> 03:01:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Wilson minimum would not be in the,</v>

6937
03:01:14.980 --> 03:01:15.820
<v Speaker 1>I would say the same.</v>

6938
03:01:15.970 --> 03:01:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the grip is using?</v>

6939
03:01:17.141 --> 03:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>What does the grippy sees?</v>

6940
03:01:18.160 --> 03:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

6941
03:01:18.590 --> 03:01:19.240
<v Speaker 1>It didn't.</v>

6942
03:01:19.240 --> 03:01:21.220
<v Speaker 1>And you have him and you just have to get a sense.</v>

6943
03:01:21.260 --> 03:01:22.093
<v Speaker 1>It's underlined.</v>

6944
03:01:24.270 --> 03:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6945
03:01:24.610 --> 03:01:24.971
<v Speaker 1>Is He,</v>

6946
03:01:24.971 --> 03:01:25.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6947
03:01:25.450 --> 03:01:26.830
<v Speaker 1>he's calling it a Gogo choke.</v>

6948
03:01:26.831 --> 03:01:27.101
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6949
03:01:27.101 --> 03:01:30.760
<v Speaker 1>So what that means to me is that he's sticking something in your neck because</v>

6950
03:01:30.761 --> 03:01:33.070
<v Speaker 1>he's doing it like a Google Plata where it goes like into your,</v>

6951
03:01:33.170 --> 03:01:34.003
<v Speaker 1>your wind pipe.</v>

6952
03:01:34.060 --> 03:01:37.320
<v Speaker 1>So I'm thinking he's holding his knock holes in some way that he's driving and</v>

6953
03:01:37.340 --> 03:01:40.240
<v Speaker 1>not to whoever goes to the side with it.</v>

6954
03:01:40.270 --> 03:01:41.680
<v Speaker 1>He's wanting to Hickson's black belts.</v>

6955
03:01:41.980 --> 03:01:43.480
<v Speaker 1>They called Hixon up the night before.</v>

6956
03:01:43.481 --> 03:01:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Apparently told crones or like really?</v>

6957
03:01:46.300 --> 03:01:46.841
<v Speaker 1>Oh daisy,</v>

6958
03:01:46.841 --> 03:01:47.370
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

6959
03:01:47.370 --> 03:01:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Crohn's has crazy guillotines but this is not exactly like guilty and it's like</v>

6960
03:01:51.791 --> 03:01:53.500
<v Speaker 1>a form of a gal at something like the form,</v>

6961
03:01:53.501 --> 03:01:55.490

03:01:56.471 --> 03:01:57.430
<v Speaker 1>The knuckles are here.</v>

6965
03:01:57.431 --> 03:01:58.360
<v Speaker 1>You can kind of see it.</v>

6966
03:01:58.570 --> 03:02:03.040
<v Speaker 1>The knuckles are going deep into the neck as opposed to the regular gay team</v>

6967
03:02:03.041 --> 03:02:06.220
<v Speaker 1>where you're cutting off the windpipe or cutting off rather the blood on the</v>

6968
03:02:06.580 --> 03:02:07.870

<v Speaker 1>humiliating fashion you got to have with your feet.</v>

7022
03:03:42.440 --> 03:03:43.300

<v Speaker 1>he tapped so harbor this feeling.</v>

7024
03:03:44.910 --> 03:03:48.410
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even like I've no nothing to do that image.</v>

7025
03:03:48.411 --> 03:03:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh that guy knows what he's doing.</v>

7027

<v Speaker 1>No beginner and one of them professions like nicest guys of all time,</v>

7028
03:03:55.571 --> 03:03:58.580
<v Speaker 1>fetus fuckers the salt of the earth.</v>

7029
03:03:58.610 --> 03:03:59.660
<v Speaker 1>He is an awesome,</v>

7030
03:03:59.690 --> 03:04:00.471
<v Speaker 1>oh is there a video?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

7033
03:04:03.170 --> 03:04:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Benefit is a monster man.</v>

7034
03:04:04.880 --> 03:04:06.290
<v Speaker 1>His grappling is so strong.</v>

7035
03:04:06.320 --> 03:04:06.651
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

7036
03:04:06.651 --> 03:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Underrated because you always see him like moving well and punching and quirky</v>

7037
03:04:10.580 --> 03:04:11.540
<v Speaker 1>kicks and stuff.</v>

7038
03:04:11.770 --> 03:04:15.590
<v Speaker 1>He's seen him just being an overall fighter but is his ground game.</v>

7039
03:04:15.830 --> 03:04:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Elliot was a wrestler.</v>

7040
03:04:16.940 --> 03:04:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Elliott's a tough guy.</v>

7041
03:04:17.930 --> 03:04:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7042
03:04:18.710 --> 03:04:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7043
03:04:19.190 --> 03:04:22.250
<v Speaker 1>When you got Elliot to the ground and I saw him just to immediately advancing,</v>

7044
03:04:22.251 --> 03:04:23.340
<v Speaker 1>just clamping down.</v>

7045
03:04:23.341 --> 03:04:23.660
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

7046
03:04:23.660 --> 03:04:24.051
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

7047
03:04:24.051 --> 03:04:27.170
<v Speaker 1>this is a high level fucking position for him.</v>

7048
03:04:27.890 --> 03:04:28.723
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

7049
03:04:28.880 --> 03:04:31.050
<v Speaker 1>But he's another guy where you just got us.</v>

7050
03:04:31.051 --> 03:04:32.750
<v Speaker 1>This was as he mounted,</v>

7051
03:04:32.751 --> 03:04:33.081
<v Speaker 1>he hit it.</v>

7052
03:04:33.081 --> 03:04:33.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7053
03:04:33.680 --> 03:04:34.850
<v Speaker 1>you know how bad ass that is.</v>

7054
03:04:34.851 --> 03:04:36.120
<v Speaker 1>You never see that in him.</v>

7055
03:04:36.130 --> 03:04:40.430
<v Speaker 1>And he eats good sweet and they joined some turn them over and just classic</v>

7056
03:04:40.660 --> 03:04:41.050
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

7057
03:04:41.050 --> 03:04:44.150
<v Speaker 1>You see it in class or for sure should in class all the time,</v>

7058
03:04:44.151 --> 03:04:47.890
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't quite make it over to the UFC high level company.</v>

7059
03:04:48.380 --> 03:04:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Benevidez has the Misha Tate Syndrome where if there was no Rhonda,</v>

7060
03:04:51.591 --> 03:04:52.460
<v Speaker 1>there's no Dj.</v>

7061
03:04:52.460 --> 03:04:53.600
<v Speaker 1>He's the motherfucker,</v>

7062
03:04:53.630 --> 03:04:55.760
<v Speaker 1>but just that during the time they're there,</v>

7063
03:04:55.761 --> 03:04:57.860
<v Speaker 1>your second best sucks man.</v>

7064
03:04:58.040 --> 03:04:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Well also the second fight they had,</v>

7065
03:04:59.991 --> 03:05:00.620
<v Speaker 1>he tried to,</v>

7066
03:05:00.620 --> 03:05:01.281
<v Speaker 1>are we out of time?</v>

7067
03:05:01.281 --> 03:05:02.120
<v Speaker 1>So what's going on Jamie?</v>

7068
03:05:02.150 --> 03:05:02.983
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

7069
03:05:03.930 --> 03:05:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Let's get it going</v>

7070
03:05:08.380 --> 03:05:09.710
<v Speaker 1>on three hours.</v>

7071
03:05:09.711 --> 03:05:12.170
<v Speaker 1>It was a big issue with the youtube or Youstream,</v>

7072
03:05:12.171 --> 03:05:13.370
<v Speaker 1>but now we're on youtube.</v>

7073
03:05:13.670 --> 03:05:14.040
<v Speaker 1>They use,</v>

7074
03:05:14.040 --> 03:05:16.080
<v Speaker 1>we were having any problems with your streets.</v>

7075
03:05:16.310 --> 03:05:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Now we've been on youtube for a while because we were having problems with both</v>

7076
03:05:19.281 --> 03:05:21.590
<v Speaker 1>feeds on Ustream and youtube is so good.</v>

7077
03:05:21.591 --> 03:05:22.051
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's,</v>

7078
03:05:22.051 --> 03:05:24.230
<v Speaker 1>it's the best way to do it because you can in the middle of it,</v>

7079
03:05:24.231 --> 03:05:25.100
<v Speaker 1>you can rewind it,</v>

7080
03:05:25.310 --> 03:05:26.030
<v Speaker 1>you can pause it,</v>

7081
03:05:26.030 --> 03:05:26.863
<v Speaker 1>you can do shit to it.</v>

7082
03:05:27.060 --> 03:05:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't really do that with Ustream,</v>

7083
03:05:28.550 --> 03:05:29.750
<v Speaker 1>so we decided to just keep doing,</v>

7084
03:05:29.751 --> 03:05:30.584
<v Speaker 1>I'm on youtube,</v>

7085
03:05:30.950 --> 03:05:35.420
<v Speaker 1>but Benevidez like the second fight with mighty mouse was like a pivotal moment</v>

7086
03:05:35.421 --> 03:05:37.100
<v Speaker 1>because he decided to like try to get flat floor.</v>

7087
03:05:37.570 --> 03:05:38.120
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

7088
03:05:38.120 --> 03:05:39.440
<v Speaker 1>He just decided like his,</v>

7089
03:05:39.470 --> 03:05:40.770
<v Speaker 1>his benefit or his,</v>

7090
03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.340
<v Speaker 1>his pro on his corner is the power.</v>

7091
03:05:43.370 --> 03:05:43.701
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

7092
03:05:43.701 --> 03:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to dig my heels in and fuck this dude up.</v>

7093
03:05:46.571 --> 03:05:47.404
<v Speaker 1>Repeat again.</v>

7094
03:05:47.540 --> 03:05:48.373
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>

7095
03:05:48.530 --> 03:05:49.400
<v Speaker 1>So if you drink,</v>

03:06:59.970 --> 03:07:01.830
<v Speaker 3>I just taken advantage of it.</v>

7159
03:07:01.890 --> 03:07:02.610
<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>

7160
03:07:02.610 --> 03:07:03.930
<v Speaker 3>But if he's going to fight on TV,</v>

7161
03:07:03.931 --> 03:07:04.920
<v Speaker 3>he's got to be in better shape.</v>

7162
03:07:05.540 --> 03:07:06.980
<v Speaker 3>You just got to be in better shape than that.</v>

7163
03:07:07.200 --> 03:07:07.921
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the day,</v>

7164
03:07:07.921 --> 03:07:10.950
<v Speaker 3>there's no excuse either one of them have been in that piss.</v>

7165
03:07:10.951 --> 03:07:12.450
<v Speaker 3>Poor shape is one thing.</v>

7166
03:07:12.451 --> 03:07:13.650
<v Speaker 3>If they don't have the Cardia,</v>

03:07:13.651 --> 03:07:16.440
<v Speaker 3>where's the bottle opener up in this bitch?</v>

7168
03:07:18.810 --> 03:07:19.081
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

7169
03:07:19.081 --> 03:07:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I think he just thought he's just going to knock that out.</v>

7170
03:07:21.271 --> 03:07:21.661
<v Speaker 3>So he said,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That shit's tight on you.</v>

7239
03:09:01.561 --> 03:09:01.861
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

03:09:02.870 --> 03:09:04.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying Kimbo was fun to watch.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>

7244
03:09:06.481 --> 03:09:10.170
<v Speaker 3>You're defending killers but not a voice and you're worrying about voice.</v>

7245
03:09:10.171 --> 03:09:13.860
<v Speaker 3>But the voices 50 listen carefully.</v>

7246
03:09:14.160 --> 03:09:15.900
<v Speaker 3>Probably healthier than let him go.</v>

7247
03:09:16.530 --> 03:09:17.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

7248
03:09:17.100 --> 03:09:19.740
<v Speaker 3>I kind like his chances versus Kimbo.</v>

7249
03:09:19.741 --> 03:09:20.251
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

7250
03:09:20.251 --> 03:09:21.750
<v Speaker 3>I thought would just go hoist versus Kimbo.</v>

7254
03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:27.810
<v Speaker 3>That's the fight.</v>

7255
03:09:27.810 --> 03:09:28.391
<v Speaker 3>That's the fun.</v>

7256
03:09:28.391 --> 03:09:29.220
<v Speaker 3>That's the fight.</v>

7257
03:09:29.220 --> 03:09:29.851
<v Speaker 3>He's already beat.</v>

7258
03:09:29.851 --> 03:09:34.590

7771
03:21:55.400 --> 03:21:59.400
<v Speaker 1>That's back when mark was the specimen before he even became a smashing machine.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was the specimen first dude.</v>

7775
03:22:01.430 --> 03:22:02.263
<v Speaker 1>He might not.</v>

7776
03:22:02.780 --> 03:22:03.350
<v Speaker 1>He might have one.</v>

7777
03:22:03.350 --> 03:22:06.020
<v Speaker 1>The best bodies mash made for white guys,</v>

7778
03:22:07.190 --> 03:22:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Brazilians columnists,</v>

7779
03:22:08.210 --> 03:22:08.811
<v Speaker 1>smashing machine.</v>

7780
03:22:08.811 --> 03:22:10.910
<v Speaker 1>When he went to Brazil and he went to Brazil before the UFC,</v>

7781
03:22:12.050 --> 03:22:13.070
<v Speaker 1>who called him a specimen.</v>

7782
03:22:13.071 --> 03:22:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Then I thought that was his two pictures.</v>

7783
03:22:16.640 --> 03:22:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Why people call them that resilience Commons bashing machine.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Cause I would say yes.</v>

7789
03:22:28.010 --> 03:22:28.701

03:22:33.411 --> 03:22:35.330
<v Speaker 1>The round his ass of all time.</v>

7794
03:22:36.110 --> 03:22:36.943
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>

7795
03:22:37.430 --> 03:22:39.020
<v Speaker 1>When he was at his best,</v>

7796
03:22:39.140 --> 03:22:40.460
<v Speaker 1>he was fucking terrifying.</v>

7797
03:22:40.640 --> 03:22:45.230
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is no one can sustain that level of Jews for more than a few years</v>

7798
03:22:45.260 --> 03:22:46.820
<v Speaker 1>and I and other intervenous drugs,</v>

<v Speaker 1>This smashing machine was a crazy documentary.</v>

7807
03:22:58.270 --> 03:23:00.740
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't seen it folks pause this podcast.</v>

7811
03:23:06.920 --> 03:23:09.000
<v Speaker 1>They caught him right when he was falling apart.</v>

7812
03:23:09.020 --> 03:23:09.290
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

7813
03:23:09.290 --> 03:23:11.390
<v Speaker 1>they went to him to film a documentary.</v>

7814
03:23:11.391 --> 03:23:13.580
<v Speaker 1>When occur was on top of the world smashing people.</v>

7815
03:23:13.730 --> 03:23:17.870
<v Speaker 1>And what they found is a guy who was just about to lose it like right when they</v>

7816
03:23:17.871 --> 03:23:20.270
<v Speaker 1>came along and started filming it and he didn't give a fuck.</v>

7817
03:23:20.420 --> 03:23:21.020
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

7818
03:23:21.020 --> 03:23:23.030
<v Speaker 1>he was like shooting up in front of them.</v>

7819
03:23:23.330 --> 03:23:26.270
<v Speaker 1>He was doing drugs in front of them within any gay too.</v>

7820
03:23:26.300 --> 03:23:26.931
<v Speaker 1>Not that it matters,</v>

7821
03:23:26.931 --> 03:23:27.764
<v Speaker 1>but wasn't he getting,</v>

7822
03:23:28.100 --> 03:23:29.090
<v Speaker 1>that's never been shown.</v>

7823
03:23:29.091 --> 03:23:30.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true or not true,</v>

7824
03:23:30.291 --> 03:23:34.550
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't a weird relationship with some woman and then yeah he was shooting</v>

7825
03:23:34.551 --> 03:23:37.040
<v Speaker 1>up like like actual painkillers.</v>

7826
03:23:37.330 --> 03:23:38.163
<v Speaker 1>Pharmaceutical.</v>

7829
03:23:42.231 --> 03:23:43.064
<v Speaker 1>It's on everything.</v>

7830
03:23:43.160 --> 03:23:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Smashing machines and everything is probably on iTunes too.</v>

7831
03:23:45.620 --> 03:23:46.453
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>

7832
03:23:47.090 --> 03:23:50.060
<v Speaker 1>How do you think this guy like I like Woodley feels like sit on the outside.</v>

7833
03:23:50.180 --> 03:23:53.990
<v Speaker 1>No one that they want Wonderboy to fight for the title and knowing the reality</v>

7834
03:23:53.991 --> 03:23:58.310
<v Speaker 1>is if he doesn't secure that fight with Robbie Lawler before UFC 200 and Connor</v>

7835
03:23:58.311 --> 03:23:59.900
<v Speaker 1>knocks out though San Joe's,</v>

7836
03:23:59.901 --> 03:24:01.080
<v Speaker 1>fuck you're a couple of weeks,</v>

7837
03:24:01.220 --> 03:24:02.270
<v Speaker 1>he's in third place,</v>

7838
03:24:02.330 --> 03:24:03.880
<v Speaker 1>he's in third place and he deserves it.</v>

7839
03:24:04.000 --> 03:24:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7840
03:24:04.160 --> 03:24:07.210
<v Speaker 1>he's in second place because like look wise,</v>

7841
03:24:07.460 --> 03:24:08.300
<v Speaker 1>public wise,</v>

7842
03:24:08.360 --> 03:24:09.950
<v Speaker 1>he's not in first place,</v>

7843
03:24:09.951 --> 03:24:11.060
<v Speaker 1>but like the UFC does,</v>

7844
03:24:11.061 --> 03:24:12.020
<v Speaker 1>ohm won.</v>

7845
03:24:12.021 --> 03:24:12.231
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

7846
03:24:12.231 --> 03:24:13.790
<v Speaker 1>So they think he's going to fight for the title next.</v>

7847
03:24:13.970 --> 03:24:15.290
<v Speaker 1>If he does fight for the title next,</v>

7848
03:24:15.500 --> 03:24:16.333
<v Speaker 1>that's all well and good.</v>

7849
03:24:16.350 --> 03:24:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Unless Connor smashes dose on Joseph,</v>

7850
03:24:18.591 --> 03:24:19.700
<v Speaker 1>then all bets are off.</v>

7851
03:24:19.760 --> 03:24:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Everything's off.</v>

7852
03:24:20.480 --> 03:24:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Who would you put your money on?</v>

7853
03:24:21.471 --> 03:24:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Connor or Tyrone.</v>

7854
03:24:24.680 --> 03:24:25.550
<v Speaker 1>That would be crazy.</v>

7855
03:24:25.551 --> 03:24:25.791
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

7856
03:24:25.791 --> 03:24:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Well what good Connor due to that guy,</v>

7857
03:24:29.490 --> 03:24:31.460
<v Speaker 1>he's so fast that it would be so hard to hit.</v>

7858
03:24:31.580 --> 03:24:31.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7859
03:24:31.881 --> 03:24:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Well Tyron is a beast and he's really good at closing the distance.</v>

7860
03:24:35.061 --> 03:24:35.940
<v Speaker 1>He's always had the car.</v>

7861
03:24:36.940 --> 03:24:39.260
<v Speaker 1>He might be able to take Connor down at will maybe,</v>

7862
03:24:39.390 --> 03:24:40.990
<v Speaker 1>and you don't understand how long,</v>

7863
03:24:41.530 --> 03:24:44.020
<v Speaker 1>75 longer</v>

7864
03:24:44.810 --> 03:24:45.660
<v Speaker 2>take them down a wheel.</v>

7865
03:24:45.661 --> 03:24:45.871
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

7866
03:24:45.871 --> 03:24:46.151
<v Speaker 2>He can,</v>

7867
03:24:46.151 --> 03:24:49.590
<v Speaker 2>he can hit outside double or even if he grabbed that really wide leg,</v>

7868
03:24:50.190 --> 03:24:50.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

7869
03:24:50.491 --> 03:24:51.151
<v Speaker 2>it's just getting,</v>

7870
03:24:51.151 --> 03:24:54.060
<v Speaker 2>getting in there is because Conor is so fast and moved so fluidly,</v>

7871
03:24:54.061 --> 03:24:54.500
<v Speaker 2>but if he,</v>

7872
03:24:54.500 --> 03:24:57.690
<v Speaker 2>if he got ahold of them fucking he would throw him on his head and hold them</v>

7873
03:24:57.691 --> 03:24:58.590
<v Speaker 2>there for a long time.</v>

7874
03:24:58.650 --> 03:24:59.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7875
03:24:59.250 --> 03:24:59.551

<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

7897
03:25:27.301 --> 03:25:30.660
<v Speaker 2>She knocked out Meesha that she hurt her knee and then she had that Amanda Nunez</v>

7898
03:25:30.661 --> 03:25:35.661

<v Speaker 2>Bad.</v>

7900
03:25:36.360 --> 03:25:38.760

7901
03:25:38.761 --> 03:25:39.960
<v Speaker 2>Like she had a bunch of issues,</v>

8020
03:28:58.480 --> 03:29:00.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's how much your training right?</v>

8021
03:29:00.520 --> 03:29:01.630
<v Speaker 3>Should that be part of their training?</v>

8022
03:29:01.631 --> 03:29:03.430
<v Speaker 3>But I'm sure it is.</v>

8023
03:29:03.690 --> 03:29:04.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

8024
03:29:04.160 --> 03:29:05.320
<v Speaker 3>Let's say their fucking life.</v>

8025
03:29:05.350 --> 03:29:05.501
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

8026
03:29:05.501 --> 03:29:09.790
<v Speaker 3>they have to turn things so you don't hit things head on,</v>

8027
03:29:09.791 --> 03:29:11.400
<v Speaker 3>you know like in that sense she,</v>

8028
03:29:11.410 --> 03:29:11.891
<v Speaker 3>she was,</v>

8029
03:29:11.891 --> 03:29:13.120
<v Speaker 3>she recovered perfectly.</v>

8030
03:29:13.240 --> 03:29:15.640
<v Speaker 3>But like when you're flying through the air sideways like that,</v>

8031
03:29:15.820 --> 03:29:17.230
<v Speaker 3>you really can't control it.</v>

8032
03:29:17.770 --> 03:29:18.581
<v Speaker 3>When that happens.</v>

8033
03:29:18.581 --> 03:29:23.350
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're too close to a wall and just going to hit kick it down,</v>

8034
03:29:23.351 --> 03:29:23.891
<v Speaker 3>shit's out of it.</v>

8035
03:29:23.891 --> 03:29:24.850
<v Speaker 3>You can increase your make.</v>

8036
03:29:24.851 --> 03:29:25.684
<v Speaker 3>You can gas</v>

8037
03:29:27.310 --> 03:29:28.650
<v Speaker 3>isn't the air blows.</v>

8038
03:29:28.750 --> 03:29:29.583
<v Speaker 3>That was though.</v>

8039
03:29:29.800 --> 03:29:32.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm just saying that cause I slid out in the rain in my old built Subaru.</v>

8040
03:29:33.190 --> 03:29:34.990

<v Speaker 3>The top Chevrolet on the bottom.</v>

8046
03:29:47.231 --> 03:29:48.064
<v Speaker 3>What does that tell you?</v>

8047
03:29:48.380 --> 03:29:48.970
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

8048

<v Speaker 3>The first generation,</v>

8075
03:30:27.820 --> 03:30:29.860
<v Speaker 3>the first generation there was just too much power.</v>

8076
03:30:29.861 --> 03:30:30.790
<v Speaker 3>They had to beef up the,</v>

8077
03:30:31.010 --> 03:30:32.800
<v Speaker 3>the transmission launch control.</v>

8078

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

8084
03:30:41.870 --> 03:30:42.171

<v Speaker 3>This is the new one.</v>

8099
03:31:08.540 --> 03:31:09.950
<v Speaker 3>The new one is broken.</v>

8100
03:31:09.951 --> 03:31:11.700
<v Speaker 3>Every single track record,</v>

8101
03:31:12.140 --> 03:31:14.990
<v Speaker 3>every single track they've racist thing on for time.</v>

8104
03:31:19.071 --> 03:31:19.460

8106
03:31:20.091 --> 03:31:22.760
<v Speaker 3>Zero to 60 oh zero to 60 in one second.</v>

8107
03:31:23.000 --> 03:31:23.833
<v Speaker 3>When does that happen?</v>

8108
03:31:23.870 --> 03:31:24.071
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

8109
03:31:24.071 --> 03:31:26.600
<v Speaker 3>it's there zero 60 this is just over to,</v>

8110
03:31:27.050 --> 03:31:29.180
<v Speaker 3>you can buy a Tesla car.</v>

8111
03:31:29.660 --> 03:31:31.400
<v Speaker 3>That is each everywhere it goes.</v>

8112
03:31:31.410 --> 03:31:34.910
<v Speaker 3>It's just be the fucking team America song that's faster than a motorcycle.</v>

8113
03:31:34.911 --> 03:31:36.070
<v Speaker 3>Just swallowing people.</v>

8114
03:31:36.410 --> 03:31:39.650
<v Speaker 3>The handling of this thing is fucking bananas.</v>

8115
03:31:39.860 --> 03:31:41.210
<v Speaker 3>It's more than 600 horsepower.</v>

8116
03:31:41.211 --> 03:31:42.950
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like 650 horsepower.</v>

8117
03:31:42.951 --> 03:31:43.810
<v Speaker 3>That was always the issue,</v>

8118
03:31:43.870 --> 03:31:44.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

8119

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

8120
03:31:44.720 --> 03:31:47.980
<v Speaker 3>The handling is off the charts and it has the most downforce.</v>

8121
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.830
<v Speaker 3>If any production car,</v>

8122
03:31:48.950 --> 03:31:49.783
<v Speaker 3>look at that hood.</v>

8123
03:31:49.970 --> 03:31:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Look at the louvers in the hood and events and for what it is.</v>

8124
03:31:52.491 --> 03:31:55.320
<v Speaker 3>They're usually not that expensive for the super car.</v>

8125
03:31:55.580 --> 03:31:59.570
<v Speaker 3>Take hard and if you watch the videos on it,</v>

8126
03:31:59.571 --> 03:32:01.130
<v Speaker 3>it seems just glorious.</v>

8127

8140
03:32:19.491 --> 03:32:24.170
<v Speaker 3>the fastest American race car ever for sure that you could just go to a store</v>

8141
03:32:24.171 --> 03:32:29.000
<v Speaker 3>and buy and the only cars that beat it cost over a million dollars like like</v>

8147
03:32:39.230 --> 03:32:42.350
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about something that loses track time by like a 10th of a second.</v>

8148
03:32:42.520 --> 03:32:42.830
<v Speaker 3>Gosh,</v>

8879
03:52:12.331 --> 03:52:13.440
<v Speaker 1>like he made his own cheese.</v>

8880
03:52:13.470 --> 03:52:15.210
<v Speaker 1>He lives in his nineties and he was healthy.</v>

8881
03:52:15.210 --> 03:52:18.060
<v Speaker 1>He was doing harm bars to 93 I don't know.</v>

8882
03:52:18.190 --> 03:52:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard of conspiracy about them doing that weekend at Bernie's with</v>

8883
03:52:20.781 --> 03:52:21.614
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

8884
03:52:21.690 --> 03:52:22.510
<v Speaker 1>No matter what.</v>

8885
03:52:22.510 --> 03:52:23.343
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

8886
03:52:23.450 --> 03:52:23.820
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

8887
03:52:23.820 --> 03:52:24.601
<v Speaker 1>Damn Bro.</v>

8888
03:52:24.601 --> 03:52:26.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm on Dario Dario.</v>

8889
03:52:28.260 --> 03:52:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

8890
03:52:29.010 --> 03:52:29.431
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

8891
03:52:29.431 --> 03:52:29.641
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

8892
03:52:29.641 --> 03:52:31.710
<v Speaker 1>He ain't really no did he was,</v>

8893
03:52:31.770 --> 03:52:34.530
<v Speaker 1>he died in his nineties which is way above the average.</v>

8894
03:52:34.531 --> 03:52:37.450
<v Speaker 1>The average age of Americans at 75 healing.</v>

8895
03:52:38.190 --> 03:52:42.180
<v Speaker 1>He lived 20 years past the average and he was still like,</v>

8896
03:52:42.430 --> 03:52:42.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8897
03:52:42.660 --> 03:52:43.560
<v Speaker 1>you see him in interviews,</v>

8898
03:52:43.561 --> 03:52:44.070
<v Speaker 1>he's old.</v>

8899
03:52:44.070 --> 03:52:47.220
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of the physical exertion of it looked like his brain was still intact</v>

8900
03:52:47.221 --> 03:52:48.330
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

8901
03:52:49.050 --> 03:52:51.120
<v Speaker 1>there's something to that Gracie Diet when he uh,</v>

8902
03:52:51.150 --> 03:52:51.691
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>

8903
03:52:51.691 --> 03:52:55.050
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly always smart to watch what you're eating and making sure you get</v>

8904
03:52:55.051 --> 03:52:59.510
<v Speaker 1>a lot of healthy foods and he wasn't into anything processed and he bullshit in</v>

8905
03:52:59.540 --> 03:53:00.271
<v Speaker 1>the Gracie Diet.</v>

8906
03:53:00.271 --> 03:53:00.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8907
03:53:00.451 --> 03:53:01.284
<v Speaker 1>no alcohol.</v>

8908
03:53:01.320 --> 03:53:03.840
<v Speaker 1>The Gracie diet is really interesting because the idea behind it is that you</v>

8909
03:53:03.841 --> 03:53:05.820
<v Speaker 1>make different enzymes for different things.</v>

8910
03:53:06.060 --> 03:53:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Like you would never eat meat with like water.</v>

8911
03:53:08.410 --> 03:53:09.600
<v Speaker 1>We don't make certain foods,</v>

8912
03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.591
<v Speaker 1>certain foods.</v>

8913
03:53:10.591 --> 03:53:12.360
<v Speaker 1>And apparently it makes a lot of sense.</v>

8914
03:53:12.810 --> 03:53:14.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who came up with it though.</v>

8915
03:53:14.490 --> 03:53:15.360
<v Speaker 1>You know who the,</v>

8916
03:53:15.361 --> 03:53:16.680
<v Speaker 1>who is the originator of that diet?</v>

8917
03:53:16.720 --> 03:53:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Was it Carlos who maybe it was Carlos.</v>

8918
03:53:19.110 --> 03:53:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Carlos was super into like a spiritual channeling and all sorts of astrology</v>

8919
03:53:27.180 --> 03:53:28.013
<v Speaker 1>follow it.</v>

8920
03:53:29.050 --> 03:53:29.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8921
03:53:30.120 --> 03:53:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8922
03:53:30.450 --> 03:53:34.530
<v Speaker 1>There's something to that because Henry Henry's offsite every single night for</v>

8923
03:53:34.531 --> 03:53:34.980
<v Speaker 1>dinner,</v>

8924
03:53:34.980 --> 03:53:38.700
<v Speaker 1>they're doing something right on that big ass boulevard site.</v>

8925
03:53:38.730 --> 03:53:39.563
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

8926
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8927
03:53:39.920 --> 03:53:43.650
<v Speaker 1>like there's no law and flax seed and all sorts of stuff.</v>

8928
03:53:43.800 --> 03:53:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Well those videos of these to make about how to make juices and all these</v>

8929
03:53:46.861 --> 03:53:47.390
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

8930
03:53:47.390 --> 03:53:48.420
<v Speaker 1>Energy Sandwich.</v>

8931
03:53:48.780 --> 03:53:49.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8932
03:53:49.740 --> 03:53:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8933
03:53:50.100 --> 03:53:50.711
<v Speaker 1>eating healthy,</v>

8934
03:53:50.711 --> 03:53:52.020
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking super important.</v>

8935
03:53:52.030 --> 03:53:52.860
<v Speaker 1>You mean you,</v>

8936
03:53:52.860 --> 03:53:55.230
<v Speaker 1>that's that stupid old cliche that everybody hates.</v>

8937
03:53:55.231 --> 03:53:56.610
<v Speaker 1>But you are what you eat.</v>

8938
03:53:56.940 --> 03:53:58.500
<v Speaker 1>You are literally what you eat.</v>

8939
03:53:58.670 --> 03:54:01.470
<v Speaker 1>Your body body's made out of all the nutrients that you put in and all the food</v>

8940
03:54:01.471 --> 03:54:02.304
<v Speaker 1>that you take in.</v>

8941
03:54:02.460 --> 03:54:03.420
<v Speaker 1>If you eat shitty food,</v>

8942
03:54:03.421 --> 03:54:05.550
<v Speaker 1>your body has shitty materials to work with.</v>

8943
03:54:05.970 --> 03:54:06.990
<v Speaker 1>It's really that simple.</v>

8944
03:54:07.470 --> 03:54:09.360
<v Speaker 1>If you're not healthy and uh,</v>

8945
03:54:09.361 --> 03:54:09.721
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

8946
03:54:09.721 --> 03:54:11.010
<v Speaker 1>you're eating shitty food,</v>

8947
03:54:11.040 --> 03:54:13.890
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you should do is stop eating shitty food.</v>

8948
03:54:13.950 --> 03:54:14.890
<v Speaker 1>It tastes so good though.</v>

8949
03:54:14.920 --> 03:54:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Done that mother fucker dude.</v>

8950

8951
03:54:20.221 --> 03:54:21.330
<v Speaker 1>I've had no shit at all.</v>

8952
03:54:21.331 --> 03:54:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Feel good.</v>

8953
03:54:22.000 --> 03:54:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Chit Chat.</v>

8954
03:54:22.700 --> 03:54:23.350
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

8955
03:54:23.350 --> 03:54:24.820
<v Speaker 1>your face look skinnier.</v>

8956
03:54:25.610 --> 03:54:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Getting soft.</v>

8957
03:54:26.070 --> 03:54:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like it?</v>

8958
03:54:27.550 --> 03:54:27.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8959
03:54:27.761 --> 03:54:28.241
<v Speaker 1>I'm losing weight.</v>

8960
03:54:28.241 --> 03:54:29.074
<v Speaker 1>I lost eight pounds.</v>

8961
03:54:29.440 --> 03:54:30.273
<v Speaker 1>What do you weigh now?</v>

8962
03:54:30.850 --> 03:54:34.790
<v Speaker 1>One 94 [inaudible] 98 no.</v>

8963
03:54:34.810 --> 03:54:35.680
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 94 for real.</v>

8964
03:54:36.010 --> 03:54:36.843
<v Speaker 1>How dare you</v>

8965
03:54:38.850 --> 03:54:39.850
<v Speaker 1>not lost eight pounds.</v>

8966
03:54:39.851 --> 03:54:40.960
<v Speaker 1>I lost four pounds a week.</v>

8967
03:54:40.990 --> 03:54:42.640
<v Speaker 1>What was the most you've way recently?</v>

8968
03:54:42.910 --> 03:54:47.050
<v Speaker 1>I got two oh five when I hurt my back or got up to like two oh five maybe even a</v>

8969
03:54:47.051 --> 03:54:47.890
<v Speaker 1>little heavier than that.</v>

8970
03:54:48.010 --> 03:54:49.090
<v Speaker 1>I got pretty fat though.</v>

8971
03:54:49.420 --> 03:54:50.350
<v Speaker 1>I had a good belly,</v>

8972
03:54:50.860 --> 03:54:53.580
<v Speaker 1>a good like a side belly and worse.</v>

8973
03:54:54.040 --> 03:54:54.873
<v Speaker 1>I felt gross.</v>

8974
03:54:54.910 --> 03:54:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I would catch myself in the mirror.</v>

8975
03:54:55.961 --> 03:54:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I go ill no more eating for you.</v>

8976
03:54:57.781 --> 03:54:58.614
<v Speaker 1>You fuck.</v>

8977
03:54:58.980 --> 03:54:59.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8978
03:54:59.350 --> 03:55:00.810
<v Speaker 1>it got to a well when,</v>

8979
03:55:00.820 --> 03:55:02.080
<v Speaker 1>when my back was really hurting,</v>

8980
03:55:02.081 --> 03:55:03.250
<v Speaker 1>it was really tough to work out.</v>

8981
03:55:03.700 --> 03:55:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8982
03:55:04.450 --> 03:55:06.400
<v Speaker 1>there was definitely some,</v>

8983
03:55:06.790 --> 03:55:08.590
<v Speaker 1>some time to pack on the weight,</v>

8984
03:55:08.591 --> 03:55:10.120
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as I started working out again,</v>

8985
03:55:10.121 --> 03:55:11.470
<v Speaker 1>your body's got muscle memory.</v>

8986
03:55:11.740 --> 03:55:13.060
<v Speaker 1>If you know torture,</v>

8987
03:55:13.061 --> 03:55:14.110
<v Speaker 1>it was shitty food.</v>

8988
03:55:14.680 --> 03:55:16.090
<v Speaker 1>But this diet's different man,</v>

8989
03:55:16.091 --> 03:55:20.170
<v Speaker 1>because the idea behind it is that your body starts going into fat burning mode</v>

8990
03:55:20.200 --> 03:55:21.850
<v Speaker 1>instead of glucose burning mode.</v>

8991
03:55:22.030 --> 03:55:23.140
<v Speaker 1>And if you can do that,</v>

8992
03:55:23.500 --> 03:55:25.240
<v Speaker 1>what happens is what's weird,</v>

8993
03:55:25.270 --> 03:55:25.631
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>

8994
03:55:25.631 --> 03:55:27.820
<v Speaker 1>one of the weirdest parts about it is in between meals.</v>

8995
03:55:27.900 --> 03:55:29.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't get really that hungry.</v>

8996
03:55:29.620 --> 03:55:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't get the same kind of hungry.</v>

8997
03:55:30.880 --> 03:55:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're on glucose,</v>

8998
03:55:32.240 --> 03:55:33.520
<v Speaker 1>like your body crashes,</v>

8999
03:55:33.670 --> 03:55:35.920
<v Speaker 1>your sugar gets low and yeah,</v>

9000
03:55:35.921 --> 03:55:37.000
<v Speaker 1>and that crash,</v>

9001
03:55:37.001 --> 03:55:38.540
<v Speaker 1>you get fucking starving.</v>

9002
03:55:38.541 --> 03:55:40.960
<v Speaker 1>You get desperado following that take you to get there though.</v>

9003
03:55:41.200 --> 03:55:42.580
<v Speaker 1>It took a while in the workout,</v>

9004
03:55:42.890 --> 03:55:43.723
<v Speaker 1>the workout,</v>

9005
03:55:44.140 --> 03:55:48.850
<v Speaker 1>the workout sucked some fat dicks for like the first week I told you who's been</v>

9006
03:55:48.851 --> 03:55:51.340
<v Speaker 1>doing that diet for literally three or four years is Tebow.</v>

9007
03:55:51.370 --> 03:55:52.390
<v Speaker 1>He shredded,</v>

9008
03:55:52.420 --> 03:55:52.571

03:55:54.020 --> 03:55:55.670
<v Speaker 1>won't Kingsbury's on</v>

9011
03:55:58.260 --> 03:56:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Kyle Kingsbury was raving about it and he's one of the guys that got me</v>

9012
03:56:01.151 --> 03:56:02.980
<v Speaker 1>convinced that this is definitely the way to go.</v>

9013
03:56:03.970 --> 03:56:04.803
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

9014
03:56:05.050 --> 03:56:05.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

9015
03:56:05.570 --> 03:56:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I barely as super shredded.</v>

9016
03:56:08.020 --> 03:56:09.570
<v Speaker 1>He's a smart motherfucker,</v>

9017
03:56:09.580 --> 03:56:10.413
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

9019
03:56:11.200 --> 03:56:11.890
<v Speaker 1>great guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Interesting about him.</v>

9069
03:57:10.630 --> 03:57:11.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk about it.</v>

9070
03:57:11.501 --> 03:57:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I want to discuss it and want him with on.</v>

9071
03:57:13.390 --> 03:57:13.821
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

9072
03:57:13.821 --> 03:57:16.700
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting about him as he's anti vaccine,</v>

9073
03:57:16.840 --> 03:57:17.673
<v Speaker 1>let's move on.</v>

9074
03:57:17.920 --> 03:57:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Let's move on.</v>

9075
03:57:18.490 --> 03:57:18.730
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

<v Speaker 1>please move on.</v>

9077
03:57:19.510 --> 03:57:20.343
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>

9078
03:57:20.500 --> 03:57:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Vaccines.</v>

9079
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Move on.</v>

9080
03:57:22.160 --> 03:57:23.540
<v Speaker 1>My kid just got back scenes,</v>

9081
03:57:24.170 --> 03:57:25.003
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>

9082
03:57:25.040 --> 03:57:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Not all of them.</v>

9083
03:57:25.670 --> 03:57:25.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9084
03:57:25.881 --> 03:57:26.261
<v Speaker 1>Be careful.</v>

9085
03:57:26.261 --> 03:57:27.410
<v Speaker 1>You get the Hep B one.</v>

9086
03:57:28.220 --> 03:57:30.680
<v Speaker 1>You definitely want to get your kid vaccinated a hundred percent they want to</v>

9087
03:57:30.681 --> 03:57:35.681
<v Speaker 1>get rid of as many different doctors that prescribed me what they believe are</v>

9088
03:57:35.961 --> 03:57:37.400
<v Speaker 1>more conservative protocols.</v>

9089
03:57:37.640 --> 03:57:38.960
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of doctors,</v>

9090
03:57:38.961 --> 03:57:39.320
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

9091
03:57:39.320 --> 03:57:43.610
<v Speaker 1>doctors who are leaning towards that because they feel like it gives your baby</v>

9092
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:45.410
<v Speaker 1>time to recover from the vaccines.</v>

9093
03:57:45.530 --> 03:57:48.590
<v Speaker 1>And it's not questioning the efficacy of vaccines.</v>

9094
03:57:48.860 --> 03:57:52.400
<v Speaker 1>It's saying that there might be some debate as to how many stack,</v>

9095
03:57:52.700 --> 03:57:54.890
<v Speaker 1>like how many put together they just gave them.</v>

9096
03:57:56.860 --> 03:57:57.560
<v Speaker 1>There is a,</v>

9097
03:57:57.560 --> 03:58:01.400
<v Speaker 1>there's a possibility that if you crunch them in together that there could be</v>

9098
03:58:01.401 --> 03:58:02.630
<v Speaker 1>problems because there's too much.</v>

9099
03:58:02.631 --> 03:58:03.464
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it.</v>

9100
03:58:03.520 --> 03:58:04.220
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

9101
03:58:04.220 --> 03:58:05.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a vaccine court.</v>

9102
03:58:05.630 --> 03:58:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

9103
03:58:06.410 --> 03:58:06.981
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

9104
03:58:06.981 --> 03:58:07.940
<v Speaker 1>if you Google it,</v>

9105
03:58:08.600 --> 03:58:12.410
<v Speaker 1>find out how much money has been paid off by people that took vaccines and got</v>

9106
03:58:12.440 --> 03:58:13.850
<v Speaker 1>injured or ill kids.</v>

9107
03:58:13.851 --> 03:58:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Babies had had issues because of vaccines.</v>

9108
03:58:15.860 --> 03:58:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Shit definitely has existed and,</v>

9109
03:58:17.930 --> 03:58:19.010
<v Speaker 1>but there's also,</v>

9110
03:58:19.730 --> 03:58:22.280
<v Speaker 1>it's also you have to deal with how many numbers of people.</v>

9111
03:58:22.281 --> 03:58:25.070
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about 300 million people and you know how many of those people</v>

9112
03:58:25.071 --> 03:58:26.930
<v Speaker 1>are addicted are allergic to walnuts.</v>

9113
03:58:27.260 --> 03:58:28.340
<v Speaker 1>You know how many of those people,</v>

9114
03:58:28.400 --> 03:58:28.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9115
03:58:28.700 --> 03:58:28.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9116
03:58:28.941 --> 03:58:31.050
<v Speaker 1>if they get around cats die option,</v>

9117
03:58:31.390 --> 03:58:33.230
<v Speaker 1>but that is the exception also.</v>

9118
03:58:33.231 --> 03:58:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Like biodiversity is a real thing.</v>

9119
03:58:34.940 --> 03:58:37.610
<v Speaker 1>They give the same medicine that they give you and you'd be fine.</v>

9120
03:58:37.730 --> 03:58:39.590
<v Speaker 1>They could give me and I could get deathly ill.</v>

9121
03:58:39.800 --> 03:58:40.260
<v Speaker 1>That is a,</v>

9122
03:58:40.260 --> 03:58:42.350
<v Speaker 1>that's a natural fact of being a human being.</v>

9123
03:58:42.590 --> 03:58:44.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that there,</v>

9124
03:58:44.550 --> 03:58:48.650
<v Speaker 1>that people don't exactly factor in when they start talking about vaccines.</v>

9125
03:58:48.770 --> 03:58:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thinks that it's either some crazy government conspiracy to make</v>

9126
03:58:51.681 --> 03:58:54.650
<v Speaker 1>everybody retarded or it's something that you have to do our,</v>

9127
03:58:54.651 --> 03:58:55.484
<v Speaker 1>we're all going to die.</v>

9128
03:58:55.550 --> 03:58:55.761
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9129
03:58:55.761 --> 03:58:56.211
<v Speaker 1>what about,</v>

9130
03:58:56.211 --> 03:58:58.310
<v Speaker 1>what about the CDC study?</v>

9131
03:58:58.560 --> 03:58:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

9132
03:58:59.060 --> 03:59:01.490
<v Speaker 1>from 2004 that they had to do a study,</v>

9133
03:59:01.491 --> 03:59:03.320
<v Speaker 1>the CDC to make sure that uh,</v>

9134
03:59:03.350 --> 03:59:05.270
<v Speaker 1>the MMR vaccine didn't,</v>

9135
03:59:05.390 --> 03:59:08.600
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't a autism links and there was three doctors that were in charge of</v>

9136
03:59:08.601 --> 03:59:09.021
<v Speaker 1>that study.</v>

9137
03:59:09.021 --> 03:59:09.830
<v Speaker 1>So when this,</v>

9138
03:59:09.830 --> 03:59:10.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9139
03:59:10.020 --> 03:59:14.930
<v Speaker 1>the results showed initially that there were no links to autism with the MMR</v>

9140
03:59:14.931 --> 03:59:15.620
<v Speaker 1>vaccine,</v>

9141
03:59:15.620 --> 03:59:16.550
<v Speaker 1>but years later,</v>

9142
03:59:16.551 --> 03:59:16.880
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

9143
03:59:16.880 --> 03:59:17.960
<v Speaker 1>it's happening right now.</v>

9144
03:59:17.961 --> 03:59:18.830
<v Speaker 1>One of the doctors,</v>

9145
03:59:18.831 --> 03:59:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Dr. William Thompson,</v>

9146
03:59:19.940 --> 03:59:21.500
<v Speaker 1>he still works for the CDC.</v>

9147
03:59:21.650 --> 03:59:22.970
<v Speaker 1>This is not a conspiracy theory.</v>

9148
03:59:23.090 --> 03:59:23.840
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

9149
03:59:23.840 --> 03:59:28.840
<v Speaker 1>we were told to to put all links to autism from the MMR vaccine into the garbage</v>

9150
03:59:30.201 --> 03:59:30.891
<v Speaker 1>word for word,</v>

9151
03:59:30.891 --> 03:59:32.390
<v Speaker 1>verbatim into the garbage.</v>

9152
03:59:32.510 --> 03:59:33.980
<v Speaker 1>So this is actually happening right now.</v>

9153
03:59:34.100 --> 03:59:37.730
<v Speaker 1>So the studies find that Dr. William S.</v>

9154
03:59:37.730 --> 03:59:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Thompson Mmr vaccine to video.</v>

9155
03:59:39.950 --> 03:59:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Now this is real,</v>

9156
03:59:40.791 --> 03:59:41.031
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

9157
03:59:41.031 --> 03:59:42.800
<v Speaker 1>This is not a free youtube videos,</v>

9158
03:59:42.801 --> 03:59:42.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9159
03:59:42.950 --> 03:59:46.080
<v Speaker 1>We all know what I'm saying is watch.</v>

9160
03:59:46.130 --> 03:59:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

9161
03:59:46.580 --> 03:59:47.600
<v Speaker 1>you're saying he said that.</v>

9162
03:59:47.601 --> 03:59:47.931
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>

9163

<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

04:00:08.390 --> 04:00:09.260
<v Speaker 1>it's dangerous.</v>

9184
04:00:09.261 --> 04:00:10.310
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't always happen.</v>

9188
04:00:12.800 --> 04:00:14.030
<v Speaker 1>but if I had to choose today,</v>

9189
04:00:14.031 --> 04:00:14.361
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

9190

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

9191

<v Speaker 1>I'm on the fence as your kid circumcised or not.</v>

9192
04:00:17.330 --> 04:00:18.850
<v Speaker 1>We have like three days on site.</v>

9193
04:00:18.900 --> 04:00:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it.</v>

9194
04:00:19.490 --> 04:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

9195
04:00:19.740 --> 04:00:20.250
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking</v>

9196
04:00:20.250 --> 04:00:20.970
<v Speaker 3>mutilation.</v>

9197
04:00:20.970 --> 04:00:24.360
<v Speaker 3>It like it's a cultural thing and people liked the way it looks better.</v>

9198
04:00:24.510 --> 04:00:25.171
<v Speaker 3>You know whatever,</v>

9199
04:00:25.171 --> 04:00:25.800

<v Speaker 3>You're mutilating your kids Dick.</v>

9201
04:00:27.150 --> 04:00:28.560
<v Speaker 3>The idea behind is barbaric.</v>

9202
04:00:28.590 --> 04:00:29.423
<v Speaker 3>It's archaic.</v>

9203
04:00:29.700 --> 04:00:31.080
<v Speaker 3>It's unnecessary surgery.</v>

9204
04:00:31.081 --> 04:00:31.914
<v Speaker 3>It's trauma.</v>

9205
04:00:32.100 --> 04:00:33.000
<v Speaker 3>You're cutting the kids.</v>

9206
04:00:33.030 --> 04:00:33.940
<v Speaker 3>Do you have an answer then?</v>

9207
04:00:34.010 --> 04:00:34.843
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

9208
04:00:34.890 --> 04:00:38.190
<v Speaker 3>If he decides when he gets older to get circumcised is not hard to do.</v>

9209
04:00:38.191 --> 04:00:41.130
<v Speaker 3>People who have done it like deep into their thirties you can do whatever you</v>

9210
04:00:41.131 --> 04:00:41.401
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

9211

<v Speaker 3>but try telling me it's under snappy champ.</v>

9212
04:00:43.050 --> 04:00:43.741
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>

9213
04:00:43.741 --> 04:00:44.311
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>

9214
04:00:44.311 --> 04:00:44.970
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit.</v>
