all different nootropics.
Uh,
Google it.
If you're interested in it,

14
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:54.360
don't just go by and stuff.
And if you're a,
if you're interested in nutrition,

15
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:58.650
you should really look into multivitamins and looking to eat in a clean diet and

16
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:00.510
keeping your body healthy.
But if you want to keep your,

17
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.760
your dome healthy nootropics are the way to go.

18
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.550
There's a couple different supplements that I liked it,
I don't even sell.

19
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:08.310
There's a thing called neuro one that this Guy Bill Roman ask,

20
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:09.270
he was a pro football player.

21
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:12.000
He puts out and that's how I got into nootropics in the first place,

22
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:16.140
so I always give respect to Mr. Roman house key and his product and what Alpha

brain is.

39
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.660
Andrew dice clay and his son Max is here as well.
It's happening.
And I'm Andrew.

40
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:23.010
When uh,
I was a kid,
man when I was like 19 years old.
I had this girlfriend,

41
00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:23.730
this hot,

42
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.730
dirty little Latina girl that I dated for awhile and she fucking loved your

43
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:29.874
comedy.

44
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.630
We would sit in my car and we would play your cassette and this chick would

45
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:37.860
fucking how she would cry and curl up in a ball.

46
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.850
And I remember being a teenager,
a kid,
you know,

47
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.880
sitting there listening to how fucking funny this stuff was and how dirty and

48
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:49.990
different than anything there was ever be.

49
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.450
You had broken a total new barrier for comedy to me when I was a kid.

50
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:55.980
There was never a comedian like you before.

51
00:02:55.981 --> 00:03:00.220
There was like that had this sort of like really aggressive sort of attitude

52
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.600
<v 2>about it and it was,
it was,</v>

53
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.440
it was fun and it was like you could repeat the shit with you.

54
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:07.300
It was a weird phenomenon man.

55
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.320
So for me to go from like listening to your stuff,
you know,

56
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:15.040
before I even got into an open mic and then being able to hang out with you at

57
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.030
the store and getting advice from you at the store,

58
00:03:17.031 --> 00:03:18.670
you're the first guy that ever told me to go on the road.

59
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:22.960
Well you know what that because it was sort of driving me a little nuts with you

60
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.560
because you were a new guy at the store and you know you had a big career.

61
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:29.650
We're ready.
I mean,

62
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:33.940
I dunno what people listening to this know of your whole Korea,

63
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.410
but you had a hit sitcom on at the time.
This is before fear factor.

64
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.130
It wasn't really a hit.
It wasn't when it hit,
when it got off the air,

65
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:43.900
but sort of we can't put,

66
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:47.980
it was on for five years and I would like,

67
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.210
why isn't this guy on the road?
Like it would bother me.
I always liked,
you know,

68
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:57.010
comics that were into their careers and obviously you were and you know,

69
00:03:57.011 --> 00:04:00.970
I saw you on stage doing your thing and I'm like,
why isn't this guy on the road?

70
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:05.740
I mean that's what this is all about.
You know?
And I saw that you loved,

71
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.870
you know,
after seeing like one,
three hour set,
you know that you did.
I'm going,

72
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:13.000
obviously he likes being up there,

73
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.240
but why be up there for $25 for three hours when you could be on the road making

74
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.110
all this money.

75
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:24.110
I remember the conversation and the outback back near that wall and I was like,

76
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.430
you got to go on the road now.
It's that moment,
you know?

77
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.990
And because even though you know I love what I do,

78
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.350
I also think business wise and when I started out and when I saw how,

79
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.180
you know to me how boring comics want,
you're not one of them obviously,

80
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.180
you know,
but no matter how funny they were,

81
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.710
I would also get like bored with them after like five or six minutes because

82
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:52.690
they knew nothing about performance.

83
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.700
And that's even how the whole dice thing started because I decided if I'm going

84
00:04:57.701 --> 00:05:00.430
to stay in comedy,
got my aim was never even comedy.

85
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.340
I couldn't give a fuck about comics or comedy.

86
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.490
I use the comedy stage cause I want them to get into acting.

87
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.460
And when I decided,
okay,

88
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:12.460
I'm going to do this because I had a different act way before you knew me,

89
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.490
I would do like impressions of Travolta.

90
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.000
He used to close with a dice man.
Yeah,
no,
yeah,
no.

91
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.470
What happened is my initial act was coming on stage as Jerry Lewis is nutty

92
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:24.940
professor,
you know,

93
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:29.350
with the glasses and actually lanes from Chapman and doing all that shit.

94
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.520
And I would take my magic potion and I would turn into John Travolta from Greece

95
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.930
because Travolta at the time I started my ACC was the biggest thing in the
world,

96
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.100
cause he had Saturday night fever and he did Greece.
And when I saw grease,

97
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.870
I,
me and Travolta could've been brothers back then when I was like 17.

98
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.240
So when I saw grease,
I was like,
if I could sing and dance like this guy,

99
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.190
I could put together this act that just

100
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.570
<v 3>won't miss.
And so I went to a studio in Brooklyn,</v>

101
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.430
took the album from Greece,
they took the lead vocal at of grease lightning.

102
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.190
And I started doing this act.
I mean,

103
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:14.600
the first time I went up and pip some Brooklyn on audition night,

104
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.160
um,
you know,
I came up as Jerry Lewis and it's a Brooklyn crowd,

105
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.661
you know,

106
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:25.640
and I'm up there with a giant Tuxedo shirt covering the leather and my pants are

107
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:29.570
rolled up under the Tuxedo shirt.
And I'm onstage calling.
Actually,

108
00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:32.930
I'm the Human Petty Ladies and Gentlemen,
and you know,

109
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:36.590
it's a Brooklyn audience and that my whole family is there,
you know,

110
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.720
and everybody's yelling,
get the fuck off you fucking sock.

111
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.730
Fuck you scumbag.
You know?

112
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:48.140
And now I take the magic potion and they shut the lights and they turn like you

113
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:50.420
did the music arm,
which was my intro.

114
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.780
And I turned around as Travolta from Greece and the place when fucking insane.

115
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.310
And now I come up to the mic because it was like the potion could turn you into

116
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:06.200
that kind of Wa as Jerry Lewis.
I would go half this,
Polish them,

117
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:08.600
ladies and gentlemen as the throwing shit at me.

118
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.270
[inaudible] to that kind of match on Mantilla foxy woman up both,

119
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.690
you know.
So I take the potion and I turned into Travolta,
they go nuts.

120
00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:25.280
I come up to the mic and I go to,
so you thought it couldn't be done right?

121
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.090
And they go crazy.
Now I do the grease lightning number.

122
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.550
So you're dancing and everything.
Oh,
I do,
I do.

123
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:36.290
The whole thing choreographed I work is music plans,
the whole grease number.

124
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:37.460
Um,

125
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.460
with a dance in the middle that I had cut in between fever and grease and the

126
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:47.330
place goes nuts.
And on the way out the to own is Marty and says,
Schulz,

127
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:50.900
go wait a minute,
where you go in,
because they wrecked the club,

128
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.800
they started throwing tables over cause something to doing jokes is Travolta

129
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:59.180
like,
so Mr [inaudible] system goes,
Vinny,
did you do your homework?

130
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.440
What I was doing that whole Barbarino thing,
you know,

131
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.110
so he was so hot at the time,

132
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:10.220
Travolta and there was such a resemblance and the impression was so dead on.

133
00:08:10.221 --> 00:08:14.780
They go,
we want you to headline this weekend.
And they go,
who's your manager?

134
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.200
And I go,
uh,
and I look at my dad,
I go,
he is now going,

135
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.330
well it's only $50,
but you know,
he gets to headline and I'm like,
great.

136
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.460
We couldn't even fucking believe what happened.

137
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.340
So when I came out to the comedy store,
you know Mitchell Walters?
Yeah,
I know he,

138
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:34.010
okay.
So Mitchell Walters was a comedy store comic who's from Brooklyn.

139
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.630
So he was back in Brooklyn like about four months into my career.

140
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:42.140
When he saw me on stage and he goes over to my father and he goes,

141
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.910
he's got to come out to La to do the comedy store.
And I'm like,
you know,

142
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:50.840
I wasn't even into comedy.
I couldn't care less,
you know.
And he kept calling.

143
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:53.660
He goes,
I spoke to Mitzi,
the owner,
the comedy store,

144
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:55.990
she psych from to come out there.
So

145
00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:00.810
<v 2>I come out and I do the act.
They do a 28 minute audition on a,
you know,</v>

146
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:03.480
the Monday night,
whatever it was,
where,
you know,

147
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:08.190
the emcee starts screaming at me when I come off stage.
Uh,
this guy,
uh,

148
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.840
what was his name?
Rob Guajillo.
And,
uh,
and I'm looking at the guy and I go,

149
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.490
are you to manage it?
You know,
a No.
I go,
are you the owner here?
And he goes,
no.

150
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:21.360
And I go,
then why are we even talking?
I go,
I didn't come,
you know,

151
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:25.620
across the country to do three minutes.
And of course,
Mitzi,
then I got the call,

152
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:29.430
I was in,
you know,
and you know,
I did,
I said,

153
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:33.420
you been on stage total at that point.
You know what,

154
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.490
I was in the business for about six months,

155
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:40.110
but from the night I went on stage at pips,
I never came off.
Wow.

156
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.890
Because I was totally driven to become this humongous store,

157
00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:47.190
whether it's a movie star or get my own show.

158
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.410
And so when Mitzi met me,
she goes,
you're an absolute movie star,

159
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.420
you know,
you know,
I,
you know,
I had more hair back then,
you know.
But um,

160
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.720
she goes,
you're going to stay here and your hone your craft.
The whole thing,

161
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:01.980
just like you know about.

162
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.490
And actually I took that Travolta direct all the way to Don Kirshner is rock

163
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:11.760
concert and after Kirsten has rock concert,
I was like,
well,

164
00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:15.510
movie producers aren't going to buy me to be Jerry Lewis or John Travolta.

165
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.700
I got to be myself on stage.

166
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:21.690
And that's where the whole dice type of character started.

167
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.250
And when Mitzi sword for the first time,
it was so great.
She goes,

168
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:31.710
it's never going to work.
She goes,
it's too tough.
It's angry,

169
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:36.210
it's tough.
So I told her,
just keep me at the Westwood comedy store.
I go,

170
00:10:36.211 --> 00:10:37.200
don't worry about it.

171
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:41.970
And when she said that I knew how wrong she was and I just went to work on,

172
00:10:41.971 --> 00:10:42.211
you know,

173
00:10:42.211 --> 00:10:47.211
Westwood was where she would put all the newer guys like myself and Kennison and

174
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.500
you know,
Roseanne,
people like that,

175
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:51.720
that wouldn't know like the sunset part of town was that,

176
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.220
that was in Westwood right off,
right on Westwood Blvd.
And um,

177
00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.840
that's where I got to see like this first,
uh,

178
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:03.510
this guy stabbed the guy in the alley there.
They had to stop a knife fight.

179
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.540
Oh,
it was nuts.
Disguise.
Just stabbing a guys like Dan,
like,
like this,
I'm going,

180
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.330
what the,
I had run into the comedy store and get a stool to hit them.
Wow.

181
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.250
You know,
because I'm not going to get stabbed,

182
00:11:14.251 --> 00:11:17.820
but I wanted to save the guy without the knife,
you know,
Christ.
And,
uh,

183
00:11:17.821 --> 00:11:22.100
so I stayed at Westwood and I developed the character and you know,

184
00:11:22.101 --> 00:11:26.080
the rest became history because what I was true,

185
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.150
I'm going the long way.
But when I would see the comics,

186
00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:33.390
that was my whole point on stage,
whether it was,
you know,

187
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:36.900
Leno were Richard Lewis.
So you know,
these were to clean a guy's,

188
00:11:36.901 --> 00:11:41.400
but they would bore me if the like five or six minutes I go that funny.

189
00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:46.110
But yeah,
that boring.
They don't perform.
It does no danger in it.

190
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:46.471
Well,

191
00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:51.471
I decided I'm going to become the most exciting stand up ever in history.

192
00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:53.010
If I'm going to do this,

193
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.880
I want to get people something they never saw with a comedian.
And growing up,

194
00:11:57.881 --> 00:12:01.720
like I said,
I didn't really study comics.
I studied big personalities,

195
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:06.190
whether it be Elvis,
whether it was Muhammad Ali in movies.

196
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:10.480
It was everybody from Stallone to Travolta too when I was a kid,

197
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:15.280
James Dean and Brando.
And I said,
give them that.
I'm from Brooklyn.

198
00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:19.180
Give him that because producers will buy that fulfills.

199
00:12:19.181 --> 00:12:23.650
And that's how like the acting stuff started,
you know,
and you know,

200
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.340
through the years I developed it and then you know,
when the Korea took off,

201
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:29.530
that's where the jackets became more elaborate.

202
00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:34.300
Like from everything I learned from Elvis growing up,
his performance,
his style.

203
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:34.991
And I said,

204
00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:38.650
well I don't want to be Elvis but I want to give people the Elvis of comedy,

205
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.310
you know?
And that's how the whole thing happened,
you know?

206
00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:44.890
And then when Rodney gave me a shot on his special,

207
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.400
that was the best because I would watch all these fucking Bozo comics at the

208
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:54.490
store,
not working their ass off for that special.

209
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.790
And they know who they are.
You know what I mean?
So I don't,
I don't need,

210
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.150
but I'm saying like on those nights where he got three people in the audience,

211
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.970
they're going up and fucking around and they were going to be on the same

212
00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:08.380
special with me.
And I'm going,
I don't give a fuck if the room is empty.

213
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.500
I just need to rehearse what I'm going to do.

214
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.850
Because I knew when I'd be in front of the cameras how nerve racking it is.

215
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.100
And I didn't want to have to think about material.

216
00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:21.130
I just wanted to think about performed for the country.

217
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.020
Let them see what you've been working on all these years.
And you know,

218
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.520
three months later I'm in,
you know,
Nassau Coliseum,
you know,

219
00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:33.430
it was that quick.
Jesus Christ know.
Yeah,

220
00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:38.431
I did over 300 sold out arena shows at 20,000 people a night and nobody had ever

221
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:40.691
done anything.

222
00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:45.380
Well that went on through knight from 88 to 95 and then it was the cutdown

223
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.080
arenas,
like 10,000 people a night.
I just kept going.
Wow.

224
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.720
You know,
and you know,

225
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.630
and then nobody had ever seen that kind of comedy before.

226
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:58.840
The difference between what you were doing with everybody else was doing.

227
00:13:58.841 --> 00:14:00.760
It wasn't just that.

228
00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:03.670
It was great stuff and it was funny and people are enjoying it and laughing.

229
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.150
Take it also to the rhymes along with you.

230
00:14:07.151 --> 00:14:10.870
And people fucking loved that.
Well,
you know what,

231
00:14:10.871 --> 00:14:13.430
those rhymes I still close with with the,

232
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.270
the mother goose stuff because it's almost like the hit.
Yeah.

233
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.790
We're working on this special now and even Max,

234
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.840
like even though he's a lot greener,
you know,
in the business,

235
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:30.370
he knows a lot about it and he goes,
Dad,
you've got to pull the hits.
He goes,

236
00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:32.290
you've got all this great new stuff,

237
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.800
but you got to give them some of those hits because I made it 25 years ago.

238
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.900
It's not just that your stuff is more like a song,
like it's,

239
00:14:39.901 --> 00:14:44.190
it's great to hear it again.
You know?
Like if I don't,
if I don't do those Rome's,

240
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.810
if I don't do the poems,
the audience is dramatic press.

241
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.440
Like why didn't he do the poem?
It's like going to see Leonard Skinner.

242
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.810
<v 3>They don't do free bird.
That's right.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
We,
I,
well,
you know,</v>

243
00:14:56.811 --> 00:15:00.980
I can't tell you how many times in my life I've heard what's in the bowl,
bitch.

244
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.420
It just became this gigantic thing that,
you know,

245
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.970
even now since entourage,
that was the resurgence that I've been taught.

246
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.810
I did a southern tour recently and I didn't know it was going to go on.
You know,

247
00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:17.030
because I haven't really been out there in a decade.

248
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:22.610
And I was with Don Jamison and Jim Florentine from that metal show and they've

249
00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:27.110
opened for me for years before they got the metal show and they would come over

250
00:15:27.111 --> 00:15:27.830
to me and they go,

251
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:32.830
it's just happening all over again because the mania of the crowds now,

252
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.970
it might as well be 1988 and I didn't see that common.
You know,

253
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:42.830
I just didn't see it coming again.
You know.
But I'm also that type,
you know,

254
00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:44.120
and I think you got that in you,

255
00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:48.020
that fighter instinct that that belief in yourself that you can,

256
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.350
you can overcome anything,
you know?
And it was like,

257
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:53.900
you know what to do this special,

258
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:58.850
I'm going to give them something once again where they think they can't be

259
00:15:58.851 --> 00:16:02.480
shocked anymore where they think it's all been done.

260
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.720
And it's not because I don't care what anybody does on stage.

261
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:12.820
I take my thoughts and I create these fucking pictures in their head that'll

262
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:17.380
like cartoons.
Cause I'm not a political comic.
I talk about,
you know,

263
00:16:17.381 --> 00:16:21.230
from talking about technology,
I'm basically talking about,
you know,

264
00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:24.530
even if you get on your computer to make believe you go into your email,

265
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:28.880
we know you're headed for the porn sites.
We know where people are gone.

266
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:33.440
That's what it's all about.
You know,
like even this new generation of women,

267
00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.700
you know,
it's like they grew up on porn,
you know,

268
00:16:37.701 --> 00:16:41.120
and I didn't come on here to do my material,
but that's what it is.

269
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.870
Like I've had a friend come to me and go,
yeah,
I went out with this chick.

270
00:16:44.871 --> 00:16:46.970
I really liked her.
And,
and you know,

271
00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:50.840
I wound up like doing everything with her the first night,
you know,

272
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:55.460
and some I could call her again because she's a real pig.
And I go,
you know,
I go,

273
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.530
but she did what you wanted her to do.

274
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.920
And maybe you're the only fucking guy she ever did that with.

275
00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:02.810
Did you ever think of that?
You know,

276
00:17:02.811 --> 00:17:06.920
maybe she doesn't do that with every fucking guy and she liked you enough to do

277
00:17:06.921 --> 00:17:11.620
it.
I'm like,
I wound up marrying her.
Wow.
Strong guys.
No,

278
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:16.760
but I'm saying,
you know,
you can't,
you know,
I always loved sex.
I always,
you know,

279
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.570
the,
the reason I even got out to the women's stuff,
like with,
with,
uh,

280
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:23.570
what I do on stage is because when I grew up in Brooklyn,

281
00:17:23.571 --> 00:17:25.730
I always had a girlfriend.
But you know,

282
00:17:25.731 --> 00:17:27.920
I always treated them with a lot of respect.

283
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:31.820
I wouldn't even think a touch in that tit for the first couple months,
you know,

284
00:17:31.821 --> 00:17:35.090
it was,
I just wouldn't do it,
you know,
unless they push the issue.

285
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.460
But when I moved to La in [inaudible] 80,
it wasn't even an 89 yet.

286
00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.800
No,
it wasn't even 79 yet.

287
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:47.180
It was a whole different set of fucking rules out here.
Like I would try,

288
00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:50.910
like if I met a girl,
why don't we go over to Ben Franked,
well,
where do you live?

289
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.111
I've got no,

290
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:54.990
we'll go for a bike while we could just go up to your house and hang out.

291
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.840
And then it was just one after the other.

292
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.950
And that's where the material would come from because girls that,

293
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.870
another guy would be writing a love letter to you know,
is now,
you know,

294
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:11.820
licking my balls.
Like she's the house dog,
you know,
and,
and I was like,

295
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:15.090
this is the subject matter right here.
You know,

296
00:18:15.091 --> 00:18:20.010
that's where lines like treat me like the pig that I am because that's how they

297
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:21.120
want it to be treated.

298
00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:26.121
But back then when my career took off an 88 and I did my special and I would do

299
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.270
you know that we're in the heels and the hair with that attitude,

300
00:18:30.271 --> 00:18:32.460
like treat me like the pig that I am.

301
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.880
And women would get insulted from that back then they knew what fucking slobs

302
00:18:39.091 --> 00:18:42.540
they were.
They just want to admit it today.

303
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.840
Did the most aggressive fucking generation I've ever come to know.

304
00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.100
And it was like sex and the city did that start that?
Yeah,
definitely.
Yeah,

305
00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:56.760
with the,
with the little piglets on there,
like it's okay to be a hooker.
Yeah.

306
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.770
And that's what,
that was a smart show because they didn't put,
you know,

307
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:03.600
women on there that with tens right.
You know what I mean?
They were okay.

308
00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.810
You know,
so I do a bit on,
you know,
to sex in the city with Sarah.

309
00:19:06.811 --> 00:19:10.590
Jessica got a face that looks like it did fucking prison time,

310
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:14.480
you know what I mean?
But the one that always got me was a Monad,

311
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:17.910
a short red hair,
whatever the fuck her name is.
And she,

312
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.150
that was an episode where she was talking about,
you know,

313
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.270
look in a guy's ass calling it in a cute way.

314
00:19:24.271 --> 00:19:27.120
Tisha Lingus and I'm watching this going,

315
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:29.670
even if a girl wants to do that to me now,

316
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.840
I wouldn't want it because I'm going to picture this little pigeon face coming

317
00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:36.960
out of my ass with a face full of shit,
you know,

318
00:19:36.961 --> 00:19:41.280
with no tits concave that I'm going,
what do you do with concave?
Tits?

319
00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:45.570
Put a scoop of ice cream in each fucking one.
You know what I mean?
So,
but,

320
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.740
but it was a smart show because women in America,
you know,

321
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.460
you know that warrant tech great looking could look at that show and go,

322
00:19:53.461 --> 00:19:57.450
well if they could get all that Cox,
oh,
can I,
did you go,

323
00:19:57.451 --> 00:20:01.290
you went through a period of time in your career where there was like so much

324
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.340
push back against your material and against like,

325
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.520
like you know what,
what they were calling,
you know,

326
00:20:08.521 --> 00:20:13.140
misogynist comedy that didn't you like you like kind of cleaned it up a little

327
00:20:13.141 --> 00:20:17.110
bit for a while.
Right.
I never cleaned it up.
What I did when I did,
um,

328
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.620
a series for CBS called bless this house they want to meet.

329
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:26.460
That's the fucked up thing with doing a network show they wanted to like,

330
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.590
like on that show,
they won't even put the credit as Andrew dice clay.

331
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:33.510
It was Andrew Clay and I'll never forget my,
my booking agent going,

332
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.800
what do they think?
People aren't going to know who it is.
You know what I mean?

333
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.830
And,
and that,

334
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:44.940
that's why it didn't told me down because this thank God the show got canceled

335
00:20:44.941 --> 00:20:49.941
when it did because I was so bored every day I put on like 40 pounds in three

336
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:54.040
months playing a post man.

337
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.650
And you know when,

338
00:20:56.651 --> 00:21:01.030
when and when the show got canceled.
This is the fun,

339
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.420
Max loves this.
The day of the show got canceled.

340
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.280
Like I was the happiest guy in the world.
I came home and I ran three miles,

341
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.660
you know,
my wife goes,
what's the matter?
Why are you home early?
I go,

342
00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.330
the show got canceled.
I call them go and run in.

343
00:21:16.331 --> 00:21:17.770
I've got to get ready for the special cause.

344
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:21.910
I booked the special with HBO for three months down the road and I had to get in

345
00:21:21.911 --> 00:21:24.130
shape to do the special,
you know,

346
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.970
and the next day after the show was canceled,

347
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
I went to a canon drive in Beverly hills where Cathy Moriarity who started with

348
00:21:33.131 --> 00:21:38.131
me in the show owned the pizza place and the whole cast this sitting around this

349
00:21:38.891 --> 00:21:43.240
table outside like with the head in their hands.
Like,
how's everybody doing?

350
00:21:43.241 --> 00:21:47.920
I get out of the truck or some coming to get dinner for my family.
Oh,
well,

351
00:21:47.921 --> 00:21:50.920
you know,
I go,
yeah,
I know I got to grab a pizza.
I gotta get Outta here.

352
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.010
I was just thrilled.
This,
you know,

353
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.680
thrilled to death that I didn't have to show up at that studio anymore is one

354
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.180
that's one of the worst prisons for a comic is doing something that's not funny.

355
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:05.020
Well,
they really tied my hands.
I mean,
you know,
I would have,
you know,

356
00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:08.290
fights with the producer of aligns,
you know,

357
00:22:08.291 --> 00:22:12.020
especially when they make you say to were freaking,
which I always hate it.

358
00:22:12.021 --> 00:22:13.840
I hate that word too.
Yeah.
I'm going,
you know,

359
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.780
like people don't know what you're saying.
Just write something else.
He goes,

360
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.920
well,
we're not a joke store.
I go then just send me the fuck home.
You know,

361
00:22:20.921 --> 00:22:23.920
one time I did a line on that show,
he had this director,

362
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:28.760
the guy that did the pilot got the job direct and the season and um,

363
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.660
you know,
it was the opening of an episode.

364
00:22:31.661 --> 00:22:35.500
And I walk in and the kids are watching TV and I come in and I go,

365
00:22:35.501 --> 00:22:39.440
daddy made it through another day and I look at the TV.
I go,
by the way,

366
00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:42.670
it didn't ever get off the island and you shut the TV.
Right?

367
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:47.200
So I come in and it's a full audience,
you know,
studio audience,

368
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:52.120
you know about it.
And uh,
you know,
psycho,
you know,
they never get off the island.

369
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:53.770
And before I click the thing,
I go,

370
00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.440
I'll tell you that ginger keeps getting better looking.

371
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.110
And the director comes over,
he goes,
what are you playing to?

372
00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:03.520
A bunch of fucking skinheads.
And I look at this guy and I go,
you know what?

373
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.180
You play my part.
I'm going home and I leave the studio.

374
00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.570
And at that time I was with Michael Rotenberg was my manager,

375
00:23:10.571 --> 00:23:15.100
but he was also a producer of that show.
And I get a call from him and he goes,

376
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.850
we're all you.
And I go,
I'm going home.
He goes,

377
00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:23.380
you can't go home.
There's 300 people here.
What do you mean you're going home?

378
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.650
I go,
the guy fucking said this and I don't want to work with them anymore.

379
00:23:26.651 --> 00:23:31.150
I don't want to do the show.
And he goes,
you gotta come back,
please come back.

380
00:23:31.151 --> 00:23:33.770
We'll straighten it out tomorrow.
And I got to look,
I,

381
00:23:33.771 --> 00:23:37.330
cause I'm like a five year old,
can I stop and get a slurpee first?
He goes,

382
00:23:37.331 --> 00:23:40.720
get the fucking slurpee and get back,
you know?

383
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.200
And then they fired the director the next day and then they canceled the show

384
00:23:44.201 --> 00:23:45.800
like four weeks later.
And I was

385
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.910
<v 0>really happy about it.
My first show was ever on,
got canceled pretty quickly.</v>

386
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:51.260
And it's a real similar thing.

387
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:56.120
There's a producer who was completely out of his head who rewrote everything

388
00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:59.180
himself.
He Chile,
take it from the writers.
Really funny guys.

389
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.030
The guys who wrote the Simpsons,
they wrote married with children.

390
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.420
I was on a baseball show called hardball.
Yeah,
that one I don't know about.

391
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.400
It's terrible.
It was only on for like six episodes.

392
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:10.920
But the pilots moved to La and get series.
Yeah,
it's amazing.

393
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:16.210
I came out here for that show.
I was,
uh,
living in New York and I did the,
uh,

394
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.460
MTV half hour comedy hour and a,
when I did that,

395
00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:23.930
I started getting all these development deal offers out of nowhere.
It was crazy.

396
00:24:23.931 --> 00:24:28.250
I just did with this one,
one,
one little seven,
seven minute thing.

397
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.810
You get a TV show and I get banned for life from MTV.

398
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.250
I had never done any acting.
I didn't know anything about,
uh,

399
00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.750
<v 3>are you still band today?
Like could you,
you know what,</v>

400
00:24:37.751 --> 00:24:42.430
they invited me to this pissed a MTV awards to be in the audience,

401
00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.630
you know,
so I guess the banding is over now,
but it was banned for life.

402
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:47.560
That's so ridiculous.

403
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:52.750
And then I'm watching Chris Brown who beat a girl to a pole,
you know,

404
00:24:52.751 --> 00:24:56.560
flying through the air.
So in other words,
you know,

405
00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:01.540
I can't say,
you know,
a couple of little,
you know,
rhymes cause the,
the,

406
00:25:01.541 --> 00:25:05.700
the poem that got me banned was the,
um,
Jack,
oh no,

407
00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.920
Jack Sprat could eat no fat.
His wife could eat no lean.

408
00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:12.520
So Jack ignored a flabby tits and lick the Res Hall Clean.

409
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:18.200
And the reason I even did that material on the awards is because before I came

410
00:25:19.931 --> 00:25:23.800
out,
you know,
a Cineo was hosting it and a Dick Clark,

411
00:25:23.801 --> 00:25:28.060
I'm supposed to bring on share,
that was my job.
And Dick Clark comes over to me,

412
00:25:28.061 --> 00:25:31.430
he goes,
look,
if you've got to stretch,
if she is not ready,
you know,

413
00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:35.290
Cineo will come over.
And I go,
how can she be ready?

414
00:25:35.291 --> 00:25:39.090
She's putting on a thong.
What won't you be ready for it?
You know,
I go,

415
00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:44.230
don't send us any over.
We didn't prepare anything here.
And as he's doing this,

416
00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.880
he's gone,
no,
you'll stretch.
I go,

417
00:25:45.881 --> 00:25:49.390
please don't tell me what to fucking do when I'm out there.
You know,

418
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.700
and I'm thinking,
this is Dick Clark.
And I loved the guy,
you know,
and uh,

419
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:57.640
but now they introduce me and I came out angry and that were a couple of other

420
00:25:57.641 --> 00:26:02.320
comics that were on that night.
Um,
you know,
Paul Riser came out then,
you know,

421
00:26:02.321 --> 00:26:03.760
as a comic,
he's a good comic,

422
00:26:03.761 --> 00:26:07.330
but he is talking about the hats that Frank Sinatra wore.

423
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:11.560
And I'm sitting in the crowd going,
nobody's paying attention.

424
00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.440
And I had all this heat from the Rodney special,

425
00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.440
I'm not going to go out there and bomb.
I'm going to let them fucking have it.

426
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:22.180
That's it.
So afterwards when they would take me into the press tense,

427
00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.470
not one question was asked,
it was amazing to see.

428
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:31.000
And then the next day it was,
you know,
dice banned for life from MTV.

429
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:36.010
And then,
you know,
silly,
it was silly,
but it also,
you know,

430
00:26:36.011 --> 00:26:39.760
up the career even more than the arenas with selling even crazier.

431
00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.010
And you imagine that happening now being banned from

432
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.960
<v 4>MTV now.
But your point about Chris Brown is such a good one,</v>

433
00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.450
<v 2>started an internet campaign,
dice back to MTV.
You know,</v>

434
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.170
would you be interested in a show if they they,
they were smart.

435
00:26:58.171 --> 00:27:01.560
They'd have me host because since that,
since that award show,

436
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.720
nothing exciting has happened though.
What'd you list with?

437
00:27:04.721 --> 00:27:07.560
Nothing that you don't understand.
I didn't get pressed for a week.

438
00:27:07.561 --> 00:27:09.460
I got press for three

439
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.030
<v 4>from that MTV.
They didn't even mention the fucking winners when it happened.</v>

440
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:19.920
I was in every newspaper on every new show and I'm going,

441
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.950
I'm a fucking comic.
Like it was so overwhelming.
Would you,

442
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.080
would you live with a sneaky or a loader if you ha,
if they wanted you to know,

443
00:27:28.081 --> 00:27:32.220
I don't want to do that kind of show.
You know?
I watched that show,
you know,

444
00:27:32.221 --> 00:27:36.740
but you know,
I don't need snuck me in my life.
He's fun.
You know what I mean?

445
00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:41.050
Lucky though.
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,
couldn't met him living with Kurt loader,

446
00:27:41.051 --> 00:27:44.540
the loader or is that his name?
He's the guy.
The original guy.
Yeah.

447
00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.700
Current load is the guy that had a talk about me being banned from MTV.

448
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.250
Who is it that got really

449
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.860
<v 2>pissy about it though?
Somebody really dis,
it was really disappointing.</v>

450
00:27:52.861 --> 00:27:55.920
They were like massage and he is not funny.
And I'm like,
oh no,

451
00:27:55.921 --> 00:28:00.450
I had every group the now organization over what it's like,

452
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:04.260
what kind of unrealistic expectations,
you know,
do these people have?

453
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.940
Well he also got understand comedy.

454
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.620
You got to understand that was when the whole,
uh,

455
00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:12.900
the gays were coming out of the closet when I hit and I would do all the jokes,

456
00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:16.740
like,
you know,
bisexual.
And I'm like,
what do you mean you either suck dick go,

457
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:21.600
you don't Suck Dick.
You know,
you know,
and it wasn't,
it wasn't hateful jokes.

458
00:28:21.601 --> 00:28:25.110
It was just on the money,
you know?
And then the rest of the joke was,

459
00:28:25.111 --> 00:28:28.130
what do you do?
Wake up in the morning,
flip a coin to decide,
you know,
to Joe,

460
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:33.750
it's,
you know,
it's offensive.
Comedy is a legitimate genre of comedy.

461
00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:37.450
This is not get the respect that it deserves.
Well,
it's like I tell him,
Max,

462
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.010
be truthful on stage to talk about your life.
It's the funniest shit.

463
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.590
And it's proof positive that despite the fact that look,

464
00:28:43.591 --> 00:28:46.160
thinking he could never put any of your stuff that you did,

465
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.190
they could never put it on the tonight show,
they could never put it on,
you know,

466
00:28:50.191 --> 00:28:55.020
uh,
any,
any sort of mainstream show.
But yet you sold out arena after arena,

467
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:58.830
like no other comic.
So it's really ridiculous.

468
00:28:58.831 --> 00:29:02.790
But even with the talk shows,
I used to look at them like,
you know,
you got a guy,

469
00:29:02.791 --> 00:29:06.870
he is selling an 80,000 seats a weekend,
you know,

470
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:10.440
and guys like Letterman and Leno,
that wasn't good enough for them.

471
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:13.630
You know what I mean?
But you know,
your own talk show,
you know what,

472
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.980
I don't want to do a talk show.
I,
you know,
um,
what about on the Internet?

473
00:29:16.981 --> 00:29:20.250
Would you be interested in doing like a podcast?
Not really.
No.
No.

474
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.610
I'm just saying you could just turn on anytime you want.
What I'm going to do,

475
00:29:23.611 --> 00:29:26.320
I'm going to do this special,
you know,
uh,
you know,

476
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.580
I see what's going on on the road and then I'm going to go into these big places

477
00:29:29.581 --> 00:29:29.851
again.

478
00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:34.200
I want to do the type of tour that fans have been wanting from me for years

479
00:29:34.201 --> 00:29:38.850
again.
So I'm making damn sure that this special,
you know,

480
00:29:38.851 --> 00:29:42.280
just is a sledgehammer over people's heads.

481
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.580
<v 3>And you know,
when I got all that negative press,</v>

482
00:29:45.581 --> 00:29:48.760
I wasn't expecting that when my career took off,
I didn't grow up going,

483
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.240
I want to be a controversial comic.
I didn't even think of this shit.

484
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:57.430
But the day after my first special Ed,
the dice man cometh the New York Times,

485
00:29:57.431 --> 00:30:01.900
put the demise of Western civilization and that's what started all that shit.

486
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.750
But,
and it bothered me,
you know,
it was like,
wait a minute,
don't they get it?

487
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.970
I'm a comic.
But today,
you know,
I got all this history and I'm like,

488
00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:13.330
who gives a fuck what anybody thinks about me?
You know what I mean?

489
00:30:13.331 --> 00:30:17.180
As long as my kids know what I am and my wife knows what I am,
you know,

490
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.300
that's what matters to me.
If they want to write bad shit,
right.

491
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.410
Cause what I'm talking about there is truthful.

492
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:27.790
It might be in a cartoon sense when I'm talking about crazy sex,
you know,

493
00:30:27.791 --> 00:30:31.250
and I'm talking about this new generation.
I'm talking about,
you know,

494
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:33.850
years ago you go out on a first date.
What'd you do?

495
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.290
You made out with the girl little,

496
00:30:35.291 --> 00:30:38.950
maybe you've got some side tit through her coat that you could tell your
friends.

497
00:30:38.951 --> 00:30:42.910
The next day I go,
this generation of women,
when you go out on a first date,

498
00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:47.710
if you don't come all over her,
she thinks you don't fucking lie because I go,

499
00:30:47.711 --> 00:30:49.600
I went on a second date with a girl.
She goes,

500
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.680
I didn't even think you were going to call because she didn't come on.

501
00:30:53.681 --> 00:30:56.380
I'm going hunting.
I go tonight,

502
00:30:56.381 --> 00:30:59.560
it's going to be like I put your head on the fucking yogurt machine and pulled

503
00:30:59.561 --> 00:30:59.740
the

504
00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.160
<v 5>nozzle.
I go,
that's what it is today,</v>

505
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:07.420
so why not be truthful about it and let people laugh over what fucking animals

506
00:31:07.421 --> 00:31:08.254
they become.

507
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:13.780
One of my favorite things I know about you is that you always have a camcorder

508
00:31:13.781 --> 00:31:16.510
and you're always documenting everything,
and like myself,

509
00:31:16.511 --> 00:31:17.590
I did the exact same thing.

510
00:31:17.591 --> 00:31:21.760
Are you ever going to take all that footage and digitize it and do a
documentary?

511
00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.530
<v 3>Well,
and that is people that want to do,
you know,
dice,</v>

512
00:31:24.531 --> 00:31:28.470
documentary or dice a documentary.
Um,

513
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.310
I'm talking with a,
you know who George Gallo is the writer.

514
00:31:31.311 --> 00:31:35.150
He did movies like midnight run with Denae.
He's done a lot of,
you know,

515
00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.280
he's got a 20,
what was it,

516
00:31:37.281 --> 00:31:40.750
29 street guy who was in midnight run with um,

517
00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.840
Growdon weird ever happened to that guy.
I don't know who gives a fuck.

518
00:31:44.841 --> 00:31:47.550
I don't care if he fell off a cliff,
you know,
I don't get to,

519
00:31:47.551 --> 00:31:51.150
why is he sitting there going,
I want the with dices.
Well you gotta do you,

520
00:31:51.151 --> 00:31:54.030
do you care about John Travolta?
This whole story,
that juncture.

521
00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.290
But you know what?
I think they should just leave fucking Travolta alone.

522
00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.810
You know what I mean?
You know,
cause I'm a fan.

523
00:31:59.811 --> 00:32:03.530
I've always been a fan and you know,
his personal life,
his personal life,

524
00:32:03.531 --> 00:32:04.880
who gives a fuck what he does?

525
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.940
It's weird that that at least people were willing to jump on board.
Now,

526
00:32:07.941 --> 00:32:11.570
like new messsage now are coming out and saying that he tried to grope them to

527
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.413
like

528
00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.410
<v 5>isn't an expected anyways.</v>

529
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:19.590
<v 3>Well it,
it's not just Travolta and you know why?
Like I said,</v>

530
00:32:19.591 --> 00:32:22.320
I don't want to do all this material I'm going to do on the special,

531
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.590
but you know when they make such a big deal,
you know,

532
00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:29.160
with this new presidential race and these guys are coming up,

533
00:32:29.161 --> 00:32:31.170
that shouldn't be gay marriage.
I'm going to wait a minute.

534
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.910
The country's falling apart.

535
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.150
Nobody could even fill that fucking gas tank without getting angry.

536
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:40.040
And you're worried if two guys want to want to put a ring on each

537
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.110
<v 4>other's finger and say,
I fucking love you.</v>

538
00:32:42.111 --> 00:32:46.010
I would love to see a 24 hour camera on Travolta's love lights.

539
00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.030
Come on.
He must be living like a savage.

540
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:54.770
I think it must be such a charge just to get guys,
like if he's getting massages,

541
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.180
he's John Travolta.
I bet.

542
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:58.970
How many guides you think he probably got to jerk him off like that?

543
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:03.800
Most of them.
Right.
You know,
I'm not,
I'm not saying on it.
I'm a fan.

544
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:08.510
I'm a fan too.
He's a fucking great,
but what I'm saying,
hell,
I'm one,
two,
three,

545
00:33:08.511 --> 00:33:11.030
whatever the fuck it was.
The one with Denzel Washington,

546
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:14.360
the remake of that movie.
He's so fucking great bad guy.

547
00:33:14.361 --> 00:33:17.720
I mean you forget sometimes what a bad motherfucker.
John Travolta.

548
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:22.480
He did swordfish.
He was bad.
And you know what I mean?
He was a bad guy in that.

549
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:27.440
Yeah.
Yeah.
I forgot all the pulp fiction was the resurgence.
This Pelham one,

550
00:33:27.441 --> 00:33:29.480
two,
three or whatever the numbers were.
I think it's one,
two,
three.

551
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:32.810
He was fucking,
it was a stellar performance.
I mean,

552
00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:37.590
he really comes off like a real psycho.
He died.
Motherfuck does motherfucker.

553
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.520
I was watching grease last night.
I love that.
Maybe not so stupid to say,
but I,

554
00:33:41.521 --> 00:33:41.900
it's,

555
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:46.430
it feels like to try to knock a guy down this done and accomplished what he's

556
00:33:46.431 --> 00:33:49.220
done in his life.
I would like the guy to be free.

557
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.010
I would like to guide to be able to just come out and say,
look,

558
00:33:52.011 --> 00:33:55.010
I like girls and sometimes I like guys to,
what do you give a fuck?

559
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.360
Leave me alone.
That's what I'm saying.
We live in 2012 like,

560
00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.250
I remember one time I was on how it's done and he goes,
uh,

561
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:04.720
this was over the last couple of years.
He goes the truth dice,
you know?

562
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:08.210
Did you ever like,
you know,
like,
you know,
like he plays like it.

563
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:11.570
Did you ever go gay or anything?
I got,
let me tell you something.

564
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:15.020
I'm in my early fifties.
Do you think if I wanted to suck Dick,

565
00:34:15.021 --> 00:34:19.340
I'd be afraid to fucking say it.
You know what I mean?
If that's what I wanted.

566
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.580
If I wanted some guys bulls rolling around my face,

567
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:26.420
you type your fucking heaven and I wouldn't be shy about it and I wouldn't care

568
00:34:26.421 --> 00:34:29.900
what they fucking said about it.
Cause that's what I like to do.

569
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:33.500
And something as you become a man,
you,
you,
you really come to grips with that.

570
00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:37.790
Dom Irrera was on the podcast.
He said,
I wish I was gay just so I could come out.

571
00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.460
He goes,
look a little of a fuck.
I give

572
00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:47.640
you gotta be,
you know what it is.
You will.

573
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:51.590
You get this one life you want with the self to be what you want to fucking be.

574
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:56.330
I just happened to love the box.
I always stayed since I'm a kid.

575
00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:00.380
That's what I like.
It's all good.
Yeah.
I would like a guy like trivial to to,

576
00:35:00.381 --> 00:35:03.170
to be in a society where it wouldn't even be an issue.

577
00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.230
It's always going to be an issue.
They've got to have somebody yell about.

578
00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:10.690
It's so silly.
It's just so dumb.
Who came?
Marriage people.

579
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:12.710
People can be in thrown out of their homes.

580
00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:15.950
They want to talk about gay men and I think they talk about it cause they're

581
00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:19.170
sucking.
Dick.
Then may asking,
how great would a documentary,

582
00:35:19.171 --> 00:35:22.430
remember that Mike Tyson documentary when Mike Tyson just sat down and he

583
00:35:22.431 --> 00:35:24.050
started talking about his life.
Yeah.

584
00:35:24.051 --> 00:35:28.310
I show them how great would it documentary just Travolta sitting in a room just

585
00:35:28.311 --> 00:35:30.920
on a chair by himself,
talking about how many different lists.

586
00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:35.390
Who says he's got to suck his dick and just going over how he breaks them down.

587
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:37.970
He's not going to leave.
He's not gonna.
He's

588
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.120
<v 3>not no disrespect.
I think the guy's a beautiful actor.</v>

589
00:35:42.121 --> 00:35:44.520
I think he's fucking fantastic.
I,
and I don't care what he does,

590
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.490
but I would think that would be a brilliant thing to watch because I got to

591
00:35:47.491 --> 00:35:49.590
think,
he probably said deuces a lot of those guys.

592
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:53.190
A lot of those guys are probably straight guys.
I don't know.

593
00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:55.740
I don't have to answer for something for whatever reason.

594
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.950
That's something that a lot of gay guys get a kick out of supposedly.

595
00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:03.270
[inaudible] now we only got a minute.

596
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:09.510
Apparently he was telling dude's shit.
Like I actually admired his game.

597
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:13.890
He was telling dude's shit like I don't like elbows and I don't like forums only

598
00:36:13.891 --> 00:36:17.640
hands and work exclusively on the buttocks.
And you know what?

599
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:22.620
I want his elbows and fucking it.
Right.
I'm constantly getting my bag.

600
00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:26.030
I got the worst fucking back in history.
Yeah.
I've uh,

601
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:29.130
just gotten over a back injury.
You've got a back injury in Jujitsu.

602
00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.930
It took like three months to heal.
When you get old.
Second.

603
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:35.400
I tell Max the only guy in comedy,
I'd never want to have a fight with Joe Rogan.

604
00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.540
You're the only guy give it up to it.
I got any comic that's ever fucked with me.

605
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.990
I like look at them and go,
why would you want to do this to yourself?

606
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:48.480
Because I'm an animal.
You know what I mean?
I go,
Rogan is the real deal.
I go,

607
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:52.760
you got to be an asshole to come over at Tim and STI seem Rogan.
I seen Rogan go.

608
00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:55.110
If there was fans outside the comedy club,

609
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.540
he would have an argument in the fuck it.

610
00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.970
He's having an argument with this guy.
Well,
I'll tell you another argument,

611
00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:03.930
which was even funny.

612
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:08.370
He has an argument with this Guy Max and the guy walks out and then if there was

613
00:37:08.371 --> 00:37:13.320
show,
he comes out and continues with like 20 people between he's calling.

614
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.900
Fuck Yo,
what the fuck are you going to do?

615
00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:19.800
And he's like spitting at the guy.
He hated him so much.

616
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.640
Well he had threatened one of the other comedians.
No,
I know.
I know how to deal,

617
00:37:23.641 --> 00:37:28.200
but it was just so great to see because you have a temper like mine.

618
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:32.190
I go fucking nuts.
I got a bad temper and then one night you got mad.

619
00:37:32.191 --> 00:37:34.050
This wasn't about a physical thing,

620
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:39.210
but we was sitting out back and just talking and this woman just said the wrong

621
00:37:39.211 --> 00:37:40.890
thing to you about salt.

622
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.510
Like salt isn't good for you and you went,

623
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:49.660
what the fuck are you talking about?
Salt is a fucking,

624
00:37:49.661 --> 00:37:54.310
what'd you say to them in a row?
Yeah,
it's a fucking mineral.
But I'm like,

625
00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:58.420
like it was the most important thing in your mind.
Do you understand?

626
00:37:58.421 --> 00:38:01.990
You don't know what the fuck you're even fucking talking about.
I'm going,

627
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000
he's not even on stage and he's going Berserk and I'm like getting the show and

628
00:38:07.571 --> 00:38:09.580
it went on for a good 10 minutes and she's gone.

629
00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:12.280
No salt is that you don't know what the fuck.

630
00:38:12.281 --> 00:38:15.660
You don't know anything about the body.
You don't know anything about nutrition.

631
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.710
It's a fucking mineral.
Oh,
you went insane over it.

632
00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:24.460
And I'm going,
you know the man needs a couch.
It needs to talk to somebody.

633
00:38:24.461 --> 00:38:28.480
That's all you know.
But it was hysterical.
You know,

634
00:38:28.481 --> 00:38:30.640
anytime I'd seen you blow up like that,

635
00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.600
like take it like I'd rather watch you outside screaming at somebody to watch

636
00:38:34.601 --> 00:38:39.160
any 10 on stage.
You know what I mean?
It's so entertained.

637
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.820
That's why you love what you do.
Cause you know you go nuts.
You know,

638
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.360
you know you,
you know when you're on stage how you get,
you know,

639
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:51.600
it's fucking crazy.
I love it.
That's what I like to watch.
You know?

640
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.900
I can't sit there and go,
ha ha,
it's not good enough.
Ha Ha.

641
00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.570
Just doesn't fucking work.
Not Today.

642
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:02.860
That mineral lady threw a cigarette at me.
Oh did she?
I don't remember that.

643
00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:05.290
That was before that.
Well look at how you screaming at her.

644
00:39:05.291 --> 00:39:07.810
She was scared to death.
No,
it was before that.

645
00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:12.010
She threw a cigarette at me before that.
That's why I was pissed.
I was like,

646
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:13.570
why are you even here?
What are you doing?

647
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.700
You're just some crazy person hanging out back here.

648
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.310
Really interrupting conversations.
I'm much better now.

649
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:22.660
I've calmed myself dramatically over the years.
But what about on stage?
Oh yeah.

650
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.770
Well,
I mean it's dangerous until something ridiculous happens,
but I always a,

651
00:39:26.771 --> 00:39:28.930
I tried to be friendly about it as much as possible.

652
00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.100
Even while they're getting kicked out.

653
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.390
I should be interviewing you because I like,
I'll come over to Joe at the store,

654
00:39:33.391 --> 00:39:33.581
I'll go,

655
00:39:33.581 --> 00:39:37.180
what should I do for this muscle and that muscle because he knows that anything

656
00:39:37.181 --> 00:39:38.200
you want to know about working out,

657
00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:42.300
that's what you talked to Max to tell them what happened at the river a couple

658
00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.880
nights ago when the guy got thrown out and then you came out.
Oh yeah,

659
00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:50.320
I want to fight this guy cause I thought when I do,
you know,

660
00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:55.000
somebody talks during my show or I see a phone,
I'll throw him out.

661
00:39:55.750 --> 00:40:00.370
I actually throw them out,
you know,
and the funniest part of the whole thing,

662
00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.730
like our warn him one time,
I go,
let me tell you something,

663
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:08.120
you're going to have to face the back wall for 10 minutes.
You know,
if,

664
00:40:08.121 --> 00:40:09.790
if you do that one more time.

665
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:13.900
But the funniest part is when I decided to throw him out and security comes over

666
00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:16.330
the look in their face like,
what are you kidding?

667
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.170
And like when they're thrown at what?
What was that?
You were fucking talking.

668
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:22.690
I was having a good time.
It's a comedy.

669
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.650
You were fucking talking and he told you don't talk.

670
00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.030
So anyway,
I wasn't onstage at Eleanor was,
you know,

671
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:34.240
and all of a sudden I hear her going,

672
00:40:34.241 --> 00:40:39.070
what the fuck is your problem?
I gave you eight fucking minutes already.

673
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:42.880
So I started screaming at the,
um,
the,
the producer of the show.

674
00:40:42.881 --> 00:40:46.990
I go get that fucking guy added his fucking room before I go up,

675
00:40:46.991 --> 00:40:50.080
I'll kill this fucking guy.
So now,

676
00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:52.180
and I've never done this.

677
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:57.310
I'm in the back dressing room and I come out of the back and the guys out there

678
00:40:57.311 --> 00:40:59.680
now who's coming to see me,
right?

679
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.550
And he's being read the riot act and being told to leave.
I go,

680
00:41:03.551 --> 00:41:08.170
you mother fucker.
And he looks at me and he goes,
dice,
I just want,
I go,

681
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:10.210
I would have fucking thrown you out.

682
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:15.040
You're just a drunk and fucking cock sucker and he's gone.
But data,
I said,

683
00:41:15.041 --> 00:41:19.420
I want to throw you down that fucking flight of steps.
Do you understand me?
I go,

684
00:41:19.421 --> 00:41:24.340
I don't want you to be my fan.
I fucking hate your fucking guts.

685
00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:28.910
And he's like,
he goes,
well yeah,
you want to make some,
you know,
and Max is there,

686
00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:32.230
you know?
And I was like,
yeah,
throw you down that fucking escalator.

687
00:41:32.231 --> 00:41:34.010
You understand me?
And now my

688
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.700
<v 2>wife comes running over to Valerie and she's gone,
please go in the back.</v>

689
00:41:37.701 --> 00:41:40.220
That's what he wants.
I go,
I don't give a fuck what he wants.

690
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:44.600
I want to get my hands around his fucking throat.
That's what I fucking won.

691
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:45.380
And then,

692
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:50.380
then I'm hearing Eleanor start to introduce me from the showroom and there had

693
00:41:50.631 --> 00:41:54.260
just come out to my music like nothing fucking happened,
you know?

694
00:41:54.261 --> 00:41:58.190
And I noticed guys in his car flinging my cds out the fucking window,

695
00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:01.970
you know?
And Max was like,
I don't give a fuck.

696
00:42:01.971 --> 00:42:06.290
That was like the greatest thing that
we do.
Live comedy.

697
00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:09.290
You can run across your sheriff fucking drunk retards,

698
00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.310
trunk retards and assholes and crazy people to show.
But you know,

699
00:42:13.311 --> 00:42:16.670
one of the things about working at the store was which you were guaranteed to

700
00:42:16.671 --> 00:42:21.230
have confrontations.
The stores,
it's a vaulted time.
All the texts of crazy.

701
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:26.380
What are some of the funniest shows I ever saw was just you just attacking

702
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:27.990
people in the audience?
Well,
you know,

703
00:42:27.991 --> 00:42:31.250
you came up with something that I've been using for years that I don't know if

704
00:42:31.251 --> 00:42:33.170
you know,
came from you.

705
00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.380
You were sitting with Eleanor one night in the back of the store and I was

706
00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.770
ripping some guy apart and you told Elena,
you go,

707
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.690
I love when he turns into dice mean.
Yeah.
You know,

708
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:47.810
because a lot of them,
I actually,
the minute they talk,
I just hate that guts,

709
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:51.380
but it's for real.
It's not like a stage persona thing.

710
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.670
I just turned into myself now I'm just from Brooklyn again and it's like,

711
00:42:55.671 --> 00:43:00.470
I want that person to know how much I fucking hate them.
You know?
It's like,

712
00:43:00.471 --> 00:43:04.220
I know you brought up at the beginning,
you know,
this a puppet head,

713
00:43:04.221 --> 00:43:08.470
whatever the fuck his name is,
that fucked with Max,
you know,
because you know,

714
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.110
he just,

715
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:13.700
and the reason he fucked with Max was because he just had a talk more on your

716
00:43:13.701 --> 00:43:16.580
show.
He wanted more,
you know,
TV time,

717
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:19.450
whenever the fuck this computer is,
you know,

718
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.450
I don't really know about the technological world that much,

719
00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:28.240
but that's why he opened his fucking mouth.
You know what I mean?
And it,
you know,

720
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:32.180
I'm not going to rip them apart,
you know,
you know,
I know the guy's a nice guy,

721
00:43:32.181 --> 00:43:35.300
but he just shut his fucking mouth when somebody else is talking.

722
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:40.190
Just shut your fucking mouth because nobody cares.
What the fuck you got to say.

723
00:43:40.191 --> 00:43:43.430
People that have no idea what any of this is about.

724
00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:48.230
There was a show that we did with a good friend of ours,
Mark Ellis,
and uh,

725
00:43:48.231 --> 00:43:52.820
he was sitting there with Max and Max was telling,
uh,
uh,

726
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.620
passionate tale of youth,

727
00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:59.810
a passionate tale of a discovery and getting laid as a,
as a band member.
And,

728
00:43:59.811 --> 00:44:03.530
um,
this guy kind of marked his tail saying,

729
00:44:03.531 --> 00:44:05.660
well that's you're supposed to do when you're in a band.
I wouldn't,

730
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:08.000
it would be cool,
except you're only,

731
00:44:08.001 --> 00:44:12.170
he wasn't was this guy 14 years old at the fucking a whiskey.

732
00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.760
You know what I mean?
If you ever heard that music you,

733
00:44:14.761 --> 00:44:18.830
you'd be blown out because they were off at record deals the second time at the

734
00:44:18.831 --> 00:44:23.720
whiskey and my,
my other son,
Dylan,
who's four years younger than Max,

735
00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:29.110
was only 14 at the time with Max or would we rather would mark said was totally

736
00:44:30.291 --> 00:44:32.040
blown out of and when

737
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.080
<v 4>I was talking red.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Me and my friends,
I know that he shouldn't,</v>

738
00:44:36.081 --> 00:44:40.370
the tall it was,
he was just,
I'm glad you're friends with him.

739
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.233
He was strictly,

740
00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:44.600
when you got to face that looks like a squeezed all that your eyes,

741
00:44:44.601 --> 00:44:46.190
nose and conquered pop out.

742
00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.370
You should shut your fucking mouth when somebody is telling a story.

743
00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.550
But now I'm going to end up running into him.
Oh,
it's going to be fine.
No,

744
00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:57.520
it's fine.
You put a picture of my line.
You motherfucker.
Brian,
how dare you?

745
00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:01.310
How you should just keep his mouth shut.
I liked the guy.
He's a good guy.
Dies.

746
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.610
I got nothing against [inaudible] joking around.
Right.

747
00:45:04.611 --> 00:45:09.110
Max will tell you it was totally just a thousand wasn't even out here and go,

748
00:45:09.111 --> 00:45:11.200
this guy,
when I see him,
I'm gonna see him at the store.

749
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:14.870
He's going to be loud handle this fucking guy doesn't have a malicious bone in

750
00:45:14.871 --> 00:45:18.500
his body.
He's,
I'll get the pipe for this fucking guy.
He's a great bang.

751
00:45:18.501 --> 00:45:23.360
His head to his fucking shoes and we'll see if he ever talks again with die.

752
00:45:23.361 --> 00:45:27.300
No,
I'm just,
I'm just goofing around.
I liked,
I'm just kidding.

753
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:32.590
You know?
I would know.
You know,
I never picked my hands up to nobody.

754
00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:36.950
You know that
Nice Guy,
puppet head.

755
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:40.310
It's amazing to get through the puppet Ellis.

756
00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:44.120
Let's see how he gets laid with that name.
When a girl goes,

757
00:45:44.121 --> 00:45:47.000
aren't you mock the puppet?
You know what I mean?

758
00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.520
That's actually a great,

759
00:45:49.521 --> 00:45:52.580
that should be the fucking quote on the cover of his book.
Well,
you know what,

760
00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.210
mark,
have you write a book.
He used that as a quick mock,

761
00:45:56.211 --> 00:45:59.420
the puppet and I like them.
I got nothing against the guy.

762
00:45:59.421 --> 00:46:00.740
I see him every night at the store.

763
00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.880
The store's about it now when I give a nickname,
it sticks.
That's it.

764
00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:06.890
Anybody ever given nick pump too?

765
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:10.280
I think that story is about the gate caved in by that mountain in the back.

766
00:46:10.281 --> 00:46:12.730
You know where everyone goes to smoke pot and sliding.

767
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.260
Big huge chunks are now falling from it.

768
00:46:15.261 --> 00:46:17.870
Like the other day there's something hit the wall and it was a bit that's going

769
00:46:17.871 --> 00:46:21.950
on for 30 years.
It hasn't been,
that's it.
He's always going on.

770
00:46:21.951 --> 00:46:24.800
A mountain is going to fall into the store.
Right.
So if it does,

771
00:46:24.801 --> 00:46:26.390
we'll perform on the street.
It is a,

772
00:46:26.391 --> 00:46:29.180
it is kind of a crazy thing to have one of those houses up there above it.

773
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.900
I lived up there for six years.
You Crystal.
Yeah.
That was a beautiful place.

774
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:36.790
Nobody lived in that house longer than me.
Yeah,
I almost bought that house.

775
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.320
You want to hear the funniest story?
Yeah.

776
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:42.030
<v 3>Um,
you know,
I've had a bunch of wives.
I got,
I got a brand new wife,</v>

777
00:46:42.031 --> 00:46:44.110
not only just got,
and um,

778
00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:49.760
my first wife when,
when I married her,
you know,

779
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:54.170
we come back to La and she had an apartment like uh,

780
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:58.860
like off of fountain somewhere.
So we take a cab to her apartment,

781
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.920
we come back from New York and she goes,
okay,
tomorrow we'll go,

782
00:47:01.921 --> 00:47:05.190
we'll pack all your stuff up and you know,

783
00:47:05.191 --> 00:47:09.740
you'll move in here and I'm standing in.
I go,
uh,
um,

784
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:13.590
I'm not moving out.
She goes,
what do you mean you're not moving out?
I go,

785
00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:17.310
I got to stay in crest till,
till I make it.
I go,
I'm not going to live with you.

786
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.660
She goes,
you married me.

787
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:22.460
<v 4>It's not like I won't see you,
you know,
I'll come over a lot.</v>

788
00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.610
She actually used to come by my house.
Wow.

789
00:47:25.611 --> 00:47:28.190
Seven o'clock in the morning on her way to work.

790
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:30.060
Cause I was in the maid's room in

791
00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:33.410
<v 2>crestal and I'd sleep with the windows open and had those,
you know,</v>

792
00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:38.410
to Spanish House with the boss.
And she barely like Andrew and go,
yeah.

793
00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:42.070
And she goes,
no,
I just want to stop by.
I'm going to work.
I go,
yeah,

794
00:47:42.071 --> 00:47:45.520
I'll call you later.
We'll go out tonight.
You know,
because,
you know,

795
00:47:45.521 --> 00:47:48.280
it was like an emergency wedding.
And uh,

796
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:52.360
cause she thought she was pregnant at the time,
whatever.
And,

797
00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.550
and I wouldn't move in with us.
So she moved into,

798
00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:58.510
so she winds up moving into crest hill,
you know,

799
00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:02.620
she moves into Crest Hill and I said,
don't tell anybody we're married.

800
00:48:02.621 --> 00:48:06.580
Nobody could over now.
And she goes,
why not?
I go,
well,
your parents can know,

801
00:48:06.581 --> 00:48:11.410
but I go and build in a certain image,
you know,
I was like 26,
you know,
like,
Oh,

802
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:15.520
you know,
and I married you for you,
you know,
not really for me,
you know,
so,

803
00:48:15.521 --> 00:48:19.810
you know,
when you had this baby,
you know,
it'll be legitimate,
whatever.
And uh,

804
00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:23.440
she goes,
so nobody could even know were married.
I got like if,
why?

805
00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:28.120
We know we're married,
you know,
and obviously that marriage fell apart.

806
00:48:28.121 --> 00:48:32.020
She moved into Crest Hill and,
and Mitzi threw us out,
you know,

807
00:48:32.021 --> 00:48:33.570
cause she didn't want girlfriends up there.

808
00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:36.910
God forbid she knew I got married and uh,

809
00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:41.140
but I was in crestal for over six years.
Did Mitzi ever give you advice?

810
00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:46.080
Yeah.
Not to do the act I was doing because,

811
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:50.770
because she couldn't figure it out too when she couldn't figure it out.

812
00:48:50.771 --> 00:48:54.460
I go,
it's never been seen and that's why I knew it would work.

813
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:59.590
It was almost like taking the kind of characters you would see like Travolta,

814
00:48:59.591 --> 00:49:02.320
doing movies,
like,
you know,
Tony Minero,
those kinds of,

815
00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:07.480
and putting them on a comedy stage.
That was my idea.
Wow.

816
00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:12.520
That was a,
an interesting time to Mitzi.
Another time.
Tommy.
All right,

817
00:49:12.521 --> 00:49:17.470
here's another time I knew I was going through the roof.
My second album,

818
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.540
which was called the data laughter died,

819
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:24.910
was a double CD with like no people in the audience from Dangerfield.

820
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:29.580
Yeah.
So you know the album.
No.
Okay.
Well.
So Mitzi,
well,

821
00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:32.530
let me tell you about how I was introduced to it by a guy named Mike Donovan who

822
00:49:32.531 --> 00:49:35.290
was a top notch Boston College.
Really Funny Guy,

823
00:49:35.291 --> 00:49:40.291
but a local guy when I was guys just never leaves and he is in fucking tears

824
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:44.860
crying in the back of of the the common connection and he was listening to this,

825
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:47.050
this a cassette and he's crying,

826
00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.770
tears are coming out of the guy can't breathe and you're doing this thing about

827
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:54.850
doing Nixon in a girl's ass like doing it and mixing impression.

828
00:49:54.851 --> 00:49:57.080
Why you eating the girl's ass?
And I'm telling you,
Mike Donovan,

829
00:49:57.081 --> 00:50:00.730
he's fucking crying.
He goes,
this is the greatest CD I've ever heard in my life.

830
00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:03.250
And he goes to the fucking guy just goes into a club.

831
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:06.010
No one knows he's going to be that.
It's 10 people in the fucking audience.

832
00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:08.560
And he has no,
no,
nothing planned.

833
00:50:08.561 --> 00:50:10.840
Does whatever the fuck he wants talks about whenever he wants.

834
00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.300
He walks the whole crowd,
there's screaming and yell at him.
He goes,

835
00:50:13.301 --> 00:50:16.270
it's fucking brilliant.
And he goes and he put it all on a CD.
He's,

836
00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:18.820
this guy was crying,
tears were coming down his eyes,

837
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:23.440
his face was red Wilson until you do next it.
What happened with that album is,

838
00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:25.480
uh,
I was doing the arenas at the time.

839
00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.430
So the first album was a high powered album.

840
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:29.600
<v 3>And,
uh,</v>

841
00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.650
and of course we also recorded the guard and that was an album dice rules.

842
00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:38.480
But then I do,
I want to do a concept of the ultimate late night set.

843
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:43.370
So Rick Rubin was the producer,
but David Geffen would put out the albums.

844
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:46.910
So first I get a call from David Geffen going,
uh,

845
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:52.580
I heard the new album.
And I go,
yeah.
He goes,
uh,
he goes,

846
00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:56.450
I don't get it.
I go,
what's not again?
He goes,

847
00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:01.520
there's no people you know,
and you hit people walking out on you.
And I go,

848
00:51:01.521 --> 00:51:05.150
well,
it's a concept.
It's the ultimate late nights said.
He goes,
okay,

849
00:51:05.151 --> 00:51:08.360
but why does it have to be a double CD?

850
00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:13.730
Cause it's like two and a half hours,
two and a half hours.
And I go,

851
00:51:13.731 --> 00:51:18.290
because it's never been,
nobody's ever done anything like that.
He goes,
okay,

852
00:51:18.291 --> 00:51:19.580
it's your career.
You know,

853
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.570
now Mitzi wants to hear some of the new album.

854
00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:27.080
So she comes up to my house like late at night,

855
00:51:27.081 --> 00:51:30.610
I'm with my friend and we stopped playing it for her and she's sitting there

856
00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.970
listening and she starts smoking,
you know,
she smoked cigarettes at the,

857
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:40.490
and she goes,
Andrew,
um,
this is gonna ruin your career.

858
00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:45.470
I go,
you don't like it?
You know,
I'm like goofing on it.
She goes,
no,

859
00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:48.800
I don't like it.
She goes,
you playing the La Forum,

860
00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:52.550
why would you put this out?
I go,
it's never been done.

861
00:51:52.551 --> 00:51:54.440
Why don't people understand that shit?

862
00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:58.700
So the album comes out and it goes gold in four days.

863
00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:03.860
And to this day it's the,
the favorite album of any of my fans.

864
00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.160
It's the dead.
I actually did a sequel.

865
00:52:07.161 --> 00:52:11.900
The data left or died part too because people loved it so much.
Well,

866
00:52:11.901 --> 00:52:13.910
it's such a real moment,
you know,

867
00:52:13.911 --> 00:52:17.060
when that got you're about as funny as a glass of milk yet,
and I,

868
00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:21.680
any other comic would have cut that out of the album.
I wanted that reaction.

869
00:52:21.681 --> 00:52:25.400
It was an,
it was an,
uh,
you know,
it was like a late night tourist crowd.

870
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:27.620
They're not expecting a perfect,
you know,

871
00:52:27.621 --> 00:52:31.970
I had like some Bachelorette party there,
you know,
I'm telling them,
you know,

872
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.780
I forgot what's even on the album because I was making it up.
You know,

873
00:52:35.781 --> 00:52:39.140
I had some notes in my pocket that said like,
bet Midler shit.

874
00:52:39.141 --> 00:52:43.310
Yodels nobody believes me.
You know that people,
when they run into me,
they go,

875
00:52:43.311 --> 00:52:47.990
what did that mean exactly?
What does our back mean?
You know,

876
00:52:47.991 --> 00:52:49.940
I'll call you in an hour back,
get it.

877
00:52:49.941 --> 00:52:54.941
But he keeps saying it like swine and I never talk about it.

878
00:52:55.041 --> 00:52:59.110
That's,
I never give up on my own.
Goofs you know,
and uh,
you know,

879
00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.530
and I never will.

880
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:05.800
That's a goof to fucking very high scale though.
Yeah.
That album when it,

881
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:08.450
you know,
I mean,

882
00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:12.230
but the speed of the sales and how much people loved it.

883
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:14.210
Like if it was the computer age,

884
00:53:14.211 --> 00:53:18.410
it would've just been a million tweets and a million.
Well,
what people loved it.

885
00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:21.020
What,
what they loved about it is,
first of all,
there was nothing like it.

886
00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:25.100
No one ever put a CD out of a 15,
20% audience,

887
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.900
half the people leaving and yelling at them.
No one,
no one's ever done.
Well.

888
00:53:27.901 --> 00:53:32.000
The second one ends with a,
I got a fight.
This guy,
you know,

889
00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:35.970
I was looking on the second on the second day to laugh the died,
you know,

890
00:53:35.971 --> 00:53:39.540
cos there's no beginning,
middle or end.
I'm looking,
how am I going to end this?

891
00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:44.820
And these two couples come in and they're drunk and I forgot what they were even

892
00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:45.654
saying,

893
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:50.780
but I get into it with the guy and then I dropped the mic to go after him and

894
00:53:51.181 --> 00:53:55.500
the album goes to nothing.
That's how the men's,

895
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.040
because uh,
at that time club Soda Kenny,
who was my body,
God,

896
00:53:59.041 --> 00:54:03.750
he jumped on me as I was running to jump on the guy because he didn't want me to

897
00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:08.470
have a multimillion dollar lawsuit.
You know,
I love club.

898
00:54:08.471 --> 00:54:12.090
So it Kenny.
Yeah,
but,
but yeah,
all stuff like that would always go on.

899
00:54:12.091 --> 00:54:14.340
But this was recorded.
That's why it was so great.

900
00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:19.560
And then those people was still there when I was done recording and I went over

901
00:54:19.561 --> 00:54:23.880
to thank that guy for getting me angry and explain to the guy,

902
00:54:23.881 --> 00:54:28.560
because I had no end for the album and now I do.
So I bought the guy a drink,

903
00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:29.693
you know,

904
00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:34.590
because I caught him coming over and out to fight them because they had a ball

905
00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:37.050
and I'm like,
no,
I don't want to fight you.
That was great.

906
00:54:37.051 --> 00:54:41.220
Inside the album happened.
I now have a great ending.

907
00:54:41.221 --> 00:54:45.810
Nobody's going to know what happens once I dropped the mic because I really got

908
00:54:45.811 --> 00:54:47.940
crazy.
Like I lose it.
I don't know what happened.

909
00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:52.020
It's what always happened to me,
you know?
Well,

910
00:54:52.021 --> 00:54:54.840
you're also in that enhanced environment when you're on stage,

911
00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:58.110
you know when you're,
when you're jacked up like that on stage,

912
00:54:58.111 --> 00:55:01.800
especially when you're in the middle of something.
It was a Guy Hecklin uh,
yeah.

913
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:03.900
He was just yelling shit.
Oh,
you know,

914
00:55:03.901 --> 00:55:06.090
when I get somebody's too drunk and an audience,

915
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:11.610
that's when I lose it because I make no excuses for adults.
I just don't,

916
00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:16.430
that's why,
you know,
with the puppet,
you know,
he's an adult.

917
00:55:16.431 --> 00:55:20.580
I don't make an excuse for mark.
Mark [inaudible].
He's a good guy.
I love the guy.

918
00:55:20.581 --> 00:55:24.500
He fucked up.
You know he did fuck up though.
Now he knows it.

919
00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:27.430
Now he knows wherever reverend,
I guess.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And,

920
00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:29.580
and when he sees me at the store,
he shouldn't even bring it up.

921
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:33.120
That would be the smart,
the smart things.
Correct.
Yes.
Don't even talk about it.

922
00:55:33.121 --> 00:55:37.080
I don't want to get mad.
I've been trying to maybe say a hello sir.

923
00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:41.190
Sometimes it might be nice.
Yeah.
How you doing,
Mr. Clay?

924
00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:44.670
I'm gonna now have to have a conversation.
Let him know what's cool.

925
00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:46.531
No,

926
00:55:46.531 --> 00:55:51.531
but I love that Max is doing the comedy and he actually worked beautifully last

927
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:52.351
week in Vegas.

928
00:55:52.351 --> 00:55:55.020
He did it down here at the ice house couple of weeks ago and killed it.

929
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:59.310
Everybody awesome.
Came back towards so much.
It's amazing,
man.
It's,

930
00:55:59.311 --> 00:56:00.600
it's beautiful to see.
I mean,

931
00:56:00.601 --> 00:56:04.650
you are the son of one of the all time greatest comics.
I mean,
that's a fact.

932
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:08.010
Dice is without a doubt.
One of the all time greats in my,
in my book,

933
00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:11.010
he's right up there.
There's,
there's only a few comics.

934
00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:15.300
There's only like a room for like if you had room for top five,

935
00:56:15.301 --> 00:56:16.890
like five greatest comics of all time.

936
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.680
He's in there for sure 100% you are the son of that dude.
Stop and think,

937
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:24.070
but it's not a big,
I don't make it a big deal with them.
I never

938
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:28.300
<v 2>did.
You should know,
but he does know.
He knows the history.
He knows it all.</v>

939
00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:32.740
But I always,
I always taught Max and doing,
you know,

940
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:37.780
they know who I am,
but it's always make your own road,
you know what I mean?

941
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:39.940
You know not to live in my shadow.

942
00:56:39.941 --> 00:56:42.840
If you do comedy and do your own kind of comedy.
What,

943
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:46.090
remember I ran into you at the Improv and you were telling me how he was doing

944
00:56:46.091 --> 00:56:50.400
comedy and you were so proud of him.
Man.
It was really cool to see.
Well,

945
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:53.670
if you were,
you were so happy that it was,
it was working out well for him.

946
00:56:53.671 --> 00:56:55.270
He just had a set and just killed.

947
00:56:55.450 --> 00:57:00.450
And you could see you have this like just a real genuine appreciation of it.

948
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.760
It was,
you know what it is.
He also has the work ethic,
you know what I mean?

949
00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:04.750
He's had it every night.

950
00:57:04.751 --> 00:57:07.930
He doesn't even let me come where he performs unless he's working with me.

951
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:11.610
And I can't blame him because a man,
you don't need that pressure in,

952
00:57:11.611 --> 00:57:13.360
in the crowd of me watching you.

953
00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:16.810
But in Vegas I would make mental notes and we talk about like,

954
00:57:16.811 --> 00:57:20.170
he'll come home like two in the morning and I'll be out like on the curb.

955
00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:23.860
Like I'm in Brooklyn Smoking cigarettes and we'll first talk comedy till four

956
00:57:23.861 --> 00:57:28.120
o'clock.
Oh,
that's awesome.
That's awesome.
You know,
so I mean,

957
00:57:28.121 --> 00:57:30.730
he knows what he's doing and he'll be on the special too.

958
00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:32.440
Does it give you an extra,

959
00:57:32.441 --> 00:57:37.120
like an extra push senior son going through the whole beginning stages,

960
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:40.600
you know,
and was seeing him,
you know,
putting together an act.
Does it like,

961
00:57:40.601 --> 00:57:44.560
charge you up for it?
Like make you more creative or more,
more,
uh,

962
00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:46.830
more excited about it?
What you know,

963
00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:51.000
I always believed in teaching kids by example.
Like I'm,

964
00:57:51.001 --> 00:57:56.001
I'm one of those fathers that actually raised my kids and a big part of,

965
00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:01.180
of what I'm doing now.
And yeah,
it's a personal thing.

966
00:58:01.181 --> 00:58:05.380
It's like it's a job that's unfinished and that's why the special is going to be

967
00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:09.820
my last special.
I'm actually going to do it at the Wilbur Theater in Boston.

968
00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:12.670
And because Boston's always been great with me.

969
00:58:12.671 --> 00:58:17.530
It's like a second home from Brooklyn,
Boston,
Philadelphia,
you know.

970
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.570
Um,
so I'm going to do it there.

971
00:58:19.571 --> 00:58:22.330
Max is going to be part of that show and you know,

972
00:58:22.331 --> 00:58:26.110
he's going to show what he's got on that show and that's beautiful.
And,

973
00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:28.060
but I always taught them by example.

974
00:58:28.061 --> 00:58:33.061
And by me doing this by me training physically and mentally and being on stage

975
00:58:33.251 --> 00:58:37.000
every night shows him that even after all these years of comedy,

976
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:39.490
I'm not taking this special and going,
all right,

977
00:58:39.491 --> 00:58:42.280
I'll do the little special and see what happens.

978
00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:47.310
I'm making sure that every comic watching this thing,

979
00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:52.480
especially the haters,
sit there and go,
fuck,

980
00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:58.030
why?
Why does he still have that fucking thing?
You know what I mean?

981
00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:02.500
Because,
you know,
I'll be honest about,
uh,
right before I got entourage,

982
00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:07.870
I was about a 42 waste.
Okay.
And then I got entourage.
I'm like,

983
00:59:07.871 --> 00:59:11.740
all right,
I can't be the fat guy in the entourage.

984
00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:15.190
So I started training and I got in good enough shape to do,
to show,

985
00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:18.760
and then I kept going because I don't just think of,
well,

986
00:59:18.761 --> 00:59:22.280
let's see what happens from entourage.
I didn't wait for the phone to ring.

987
00:59:22.281 --> 00:59:25.550
I'm 10 steps ahead thinking,
okay,
start touring,

988
00:59:25.551 --> 00:59:29.600
build up to the special than there were major tour.
Uh,

989
00:59:29.601 --> 00:59:33.590
I was with David Rich last night.
Uh,
he's going to do my autobiography.

990
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:38.420
He's done people.
He did don Rickles.
As far as comics,
he's done Marvin Gaye.

991
00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:43.180
He did.
Uh,
wow.
Uh,
what's the movie?
Jamie Foxx starting?
Uh,

992
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:46.230
Ray Charles.
Ray Charles.
He wrote that book.
Uh,

993
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:51.400
he's written a ton of books and now he wants to do mine and George Gallo wants

994
00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:56.180
to do,
uh,
the,
the moving,
you know,
with your play.
You.
Well,

995
00:59:56.450 --> 01:00:00.020
I let Max tell you how that came about.
Yeah,
you can tell him the story.

996
01:00:00.021 --> 01:00:02.120
Who should play me?
Well,
uh,

997
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:07.870
the name that I guess we've all been discussing is a James Franco and I met with

998
01:00:08.061 --> 01:00:13.061
Franco about two and a half years ago to discuss the movie and because he would

999
01:00:13.581 --> 01:00:17.330
have that look of me like in the 30s,
like when I was in my thirties,

1000
01:00:17.331 --> 01:00:20.060
he can act as fucking ass off.
He can do it.

1001
01:00:20.061 --> 01:00:24.860
By the time we met for about three hours,
by the time he left my hotel,

1002
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.670
he was doing not dice.
He was doing Andrew.
I mean,

1003
01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:33.470
he's a real method actor.
He would know how to play that role perfectly.
He's a,

1004
01:00:33.471 --> 01:00:37.460
he's a real fucking actor.
Yeah.
I mean,
you,
you do a roll.
I hit him.
There he is.

1005
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:41.330
You know,
and you know,
he's,
he's the type of guy that like,

1006
01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:46.070
he'll move in with you to learn everything you do.
Did you ever see,
um,

1007
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:50.780
uh,
fear and loathing in Las Vegas where Johnny Depp Played Hunters Thompson?

1008
01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:55.160
No,
he lived with hunters Thompson lived in his basement for like six months.

1009
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:58.430
It's hanging out with that crazy old asshole while he was like shooting guns off

1010
01:00:58.431 --> 01:01:01.390
his back porch,
you know,
a hunter hunter s Thompson was gone.
Well,

1011
01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:05.900
depth is incredible depth.
As you know,
I did a movie with Johnny Depp,

1012
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:09.230
made Johnny Depp and uh,
Rob Morrow,
you know,
rob morrow,

1013
01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.370
he starting quiz show had,

1014
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:16.340
did the show northern exposure and we did this movie called private resort.

1015
01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:20.510
It was one of Johnny debt.
This is a funny story.
Um,
so it's me,

1016
01:01:20.511 --> 01:01:23.780
Johnny Depp and Rob Morrow and even the producers said,

1017
01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:27.800
the three of you guys are going to be made just stars,
you know,

1018
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:31.940
and then I met,
you know Jim Schubert?
Sure.
Okay.

1019
01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:36.350
So I was friends with Jimmy Schubert back then and I would go and Jimmy Schubert

1020
01:01:36.351 --> 01:01:40.850
thought he was going to be James Deane.
Okay.
And I would say,
well,

1021
01:01:40.851 --> 01:01:44.570
you're not going to be James Deane.
But on top of that,
you know,
Johnny Depp,

1022
01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.930
you know,
and he would laugh because he didn't know who Johnny Depp was yet.

1023
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:52.490
You know,
Johnny Depp was unknown and he goes,
fuck it's Johnny Depp.
I go,

1024
01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:57.460
Johnny Depp is James Deane.
Trust me.
You know,
and then,
um,

1025
01:01:57.710 --> 01:02:01.400
jump street happened,
21 jump street and Schubert comes to me.
He goes,

1026
01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.020
there really is a Johnny Depp.

1027
01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.450
That was a name you made up like one of your names,
you know,
I go,

1028
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:09.170
I'm telling you this is the real deal.

1029
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:13.280
And Johnny obviously has had an incredible act in Korea,
you know,

1030
01:02:13.281 --> 01:02:17.930
and every time I see him it's like I did that movie with that guy who's done all

1031
01:02:17.931 --> 01:02:18.741
these great,
you know,

1032
01:02:18.741 --> 01:02:22.650
it's like honor when you get to work with somebody that blew up like he did.

1033
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.170
Yeah,
he's a,
he's all time and he's amazing,

1034
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:30.120
but Franco's the right age to play the main part of that movie.

1035
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:34.440
And he would be doing all your materials.
So would you,
would you coach them?

1036
01:02:34.441 --> 01:02:37.470
You're going to like,
he would,
he,
that's a guy that moves in with you,

1037
01:02:37.471 --> 01:02:39.750
learns about your whole life,
you know,

1038
01:02:39.751 --> 01:02:44.751
from what you are off stage to what you are on stage because he's got to play it

1039
01:02:45.001 --> 01:02:47.670
all,
you know.
Fascinating.
What is,

1040
01:02:47.671 --> 01:02:50.550
what part of your life is it going to cover when you explode?
No,

1041
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:51.870
from childhood on,

1042
01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:56.250
but not much about childhood because a lot of that movie which show what really

1043
01:02:56.251 --> 01:02:59.830
went on with the controversy,
how,
you know,
how they pulled the,
uh,

1044
01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:04.670
premier afford failing,
which was going to be at the La Forum.
You know,

1045
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:06.090
I mean,
a lot went down.

1046
01:03:06.091 --> 01:03:11.040
The studio heads lives were being threatened by the gay community.

1047
01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:13.110
You know,
Barry Della was day with Tom.

1048
01:03:13.111 --> 01:03:16.410
They're going to blow up his house with a pipe bomb.
I mean,

1049
01:03:16.411 --> 01:03:20.070
that was all they were plastering up.
You know,
I was with Sandy.

1050
01:03:20.071 --> 01:03:21.420
Gowan was my manager.

1051
01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:26.610
David Geffen put out the albums and buried della was the movie studio.

1052
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.210
So the,
you know,
the gay community,
what posting them on all the,
uh,

1053
01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:35.240
like telephone poles in Hollywood saying how they have to get rid of this guy

1054
01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:39.900
and,
you know,
and it wound up a mess.
It wound up,
you know,

1055
01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:44.820
I got blackballed.
I got banned,
you know,
I got banned from everything,

1056
01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:49.050
including my cousin,
uh,
Herschel's bar Mitzvah,
Leonard's in Long Island.

1057
01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:53.610
I had a [inaudible] when I was first starting out.
I was,
I was dirty,

1058
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.320
you know,
and a open mic guys.
The open mic,
a host would always tell you,
oh,

1059
01:03:58.321 --> 01:04:01.380
you gotta clean it up.
You got to clean it up.
And they would say like,

1060
01:04:01.381 --> 01:04:05.160
what do you think your dice clay?
And he dies,
clay.
No,
you're not.
So clean it up.

1061
01:04:05.161 --> 01:04:08.040
But I'd probably put,
how did dice clay get to be dice clay?
I mean,
it doesn't,

1062
01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:12.120
that's right.
Can you just,
if it's funny,
isn't that enough?
Well,
you know what,

1063
01:04:12.121 --> 01:04:15.390
the first time I did Vegas with the dunes,
when Mitzi had the dunes there,

1064
01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:19.620
I got fired the second night because what she would do,

1065
01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:21.900
she would rehearse the comics act.

1066
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:27.500
You had to rehearse for her and do the jokes exactly the way you rehearsed it.

1067
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:30.150
Just to the shroud.
Yeah,
just her.

1068
01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:33.180
So now the show happens and now it's alive crowd.

1069
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:35.940
So of course I just go into,
you know,

1070
01:04:35.941 --> 01:04:40.470
all my gay material and you know I'm doing what I have to do to the crowd

1071
01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:44.100
because I'm closing the show.
Right.
So we have to the show,
she goes,

1072
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:49.950
I told you to stick to the act.
You rehearsed.
I go,
I'm not a puppet.

1073
01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:54.970
Did we say that word today?
Anyway,
I'm fucking around.

1074
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:59.730
I go,
I go,
I'm not a puppet.
And I got Mitzi,
you know about talent,

1075
01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.880
you know how to pick talent,
but you don't know the feeling on stage.

1076
01:05:02.881 --> 01:05:06.390
When you've got an audience you have to go the way the audience is going.

1077
01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:10.380
So the second night after my set,

1078
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:14.610
I actually come over to it cause I know I'm going to get fired and I go,
look,

1079
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:19.210
don't feel bad about sending me home.
And she goes,
I don't,
you know.

1080
01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:23.620
And it was funny because I sat in that showroom after then I go,
you know what,

1081
01:05:23.621 --> 01:05:27.250
they're just not ready for you yet.
And it was funny outside,

1082
01:05:27.251 --> 01:05:31.900
right across the street was Bally's and the marquee read Tom Jones is here.

1083
01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.380
That's how he would,
you know,
have it on the marquee.
And I go,

1084
01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:39.580
well that's where I'm going to be.
And two years later,

1085
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:42.960
you know,
there's my name up at Bally's,
you know,

1086
01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:47.230
so I just knew they weren't ready for me yet,
but I stuck to my guns.

1087
01:05:47.231 --> 01:05:52.210
I did my material the way I thought I should and I always have and I still do.

1088
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:55.240
It's one of those things that if you compromise and just tried to make everybody

1089
01:05:55.241 --> 01:05:56.410
happy from the beginning,

1090
01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:59.440
you would have never found that audience that I'll be back in a clothing store

1091
01:05:59.441 --> 01:06:02.710
going,
what are you a 42 regular?
That's what I'd be doing.

1092
01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:07.040
It's amazing how you just sort of calculated it all out though.
Well,

1093
01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.220
I'm doing it again though.
You know,

1094
01:06:09.221 --> 01:06:12.910
like I know the day after New Year's and this is not,
you know,

1095
01:06:12.911 --> 01:06:17.080
you have the career you have,
which is to me an incredible career.
I mean,

1096
01:06:17.081 --> 01:06:20.590
you've gone,
I mean,
between fear factor and what you did,

1097
01:06:20.591 --> 01:06:24.040
how you took it back to the martial arts and doing your comedy that way,

1098
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.920
you know,
you get my respect.
If you didn't have any of them be here.

1099
01:06:26.921 --> 01:06:28.630
Thank you very much man.
Thank you.
Great.

1100
01:06:28.631 --> 01:06:30.430
I was watching you when you first came to the store.

1101
01:06:30.431 --> 01:06:33.610
That's why I would even take the time to give you some advice.

1102
01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:37.170
I really appreciate it.
Me.
That was huge.
It was,
it meant a lot to me.
Well,

1103
01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:40.630
you know what,
when I,
when I met Dane Cook and he was doing the bigger places,

1104
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:43.860
you know,
uh,
I actually met him day,

1105
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:46.350
his father passed away and,
uh,

1106
01:06:46.351 --> 01:06:51.040
a better in Beverly hills and he was telling me how I influenced them and I felt

1107
01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:55.390
good that I'd been sticking up for the guy because I never knew who the guy was

1108
01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:59.230
until he took off.
And you know,
just like all these scumbag comics,

1109
01:06:59.231 --> 01:07:02.260
that's why I hate these guys.
They all stab you.
You know how they are,

1110
01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:06.070
and they're on the back of the comedy store.
They're not even on that night.

1111
01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:10.660
You know,
they're making nothing going.
Oh,
he's a fucking thief.
He's this.

1112
01:07:10.661 --> 01:07:13.360
He's that.
He took my Ba,
I go,
well,

1113
01:07:13.361 --> 01:07:17.580
why didn't you go off and smack them in the face five years ago for taking your

1114
01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:21.850
bed,
but not at the guys doing great.
He's not funny.
He's no good.

1115
01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.440
In the meantime,
he's drawn 10,

1116
01:07:23.441 --> 01:07:28.180
15,000 people a night and you're not making $20 tonight.

1117
01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:32.260
He hit some rarefied air.
That's what,
you know.
So yeah,
I would always back,

1118
01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:35.440
you know,
an m and m took off how people would come down on him.

1119
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:40.500
And I became friends with him over that.
Um,
actually m and m,

1120
01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.970
uh,
was going to do seven albums with me.

1121
01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:46.900
He gave me a deal for seven cds that he was going to produce.

1122
01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:52.390
And at that time I had no heat on me.
And,
uh,
he was with I think,

1123
01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:54.070
emi and they said,

1124
01:07:54.071 --> 01:07:56.950
we're not giving him the deal because there's no heat right now.

1125
01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:00.670
But that's how I became friendly with m and m.

1126
01:08:00.671 --> 01:08:04.570
And it was all of a sudden when actually the story with m and m,

1127
01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:06.730
what year would you say?
There was no heat?

1128
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:13.470
I had nothing going on from around 2000 on and till,

1129
01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:22.140
till recently.
And so his entourage,
you think 100% for all those?
I start,
well,

1130
01:08:22.150 --> 01:08:25.910
what happened is obviously I went through divorce and it was,
you know,

1131
01:08:25.911 --> 01:08:29.480
my personal life's always been more important than me then,
you know,

1132
01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:33.590
a Korea life.
So yeah,
I would do the road and I would do my gigs,

1133
01:08:33.591 --> 01:08:36.500
but I didn't have the management.
I didn't have the publicists,

1134
01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.490
the publicists out there.
All I really cared about was,
uh,

1135
01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.580
Matt when I left my boys with seven and 11 years old.

1136
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:47.840
So it was more important for me to be around and raise them the right way.

1137
01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:52.370
And they both live with me and you know,
and then I always,

1138
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:56.180
but I prepared,
you know,
through this whole past decade,

1139
01:08:56.181 --> 01:08:57.470
as bad as it was,

1140
01:08:57.830 --> 01:09:02.330
I would work on the new material and say at the right time I'm going to hit him

1141
01:09:02.331 --> 01:09:03.800
again.
You know,

1142
01:09:03.801 --> 01:09:08.630
because if you walk around telling people you're the undisputed comedy king,

1143
01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:12.020
well if you do another special,
you better prove that,
you know,

1144
01:09:12.021 --> 01:09:15.260
and that's the bottom line.
And so you like challenging yourself,

1145
01:09:15.261 --> 01:09:18.770
like completely make yourself rise to the occasion.
I Cha,
you know,

1146
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.380
Max can't tell you how I trained for this thing.

1147
01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:24.040
You know what goes on in the gym.
You,
Louis,

1148
01:09:24.090 --> 01:09:28.160
Louis Ck does that to Louie told me that he trains for a special,
like a fight.

1149
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:30.530
Like he helped me gears up,
but you get some shape now.

1150
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:34.760
You explained my dad really?
He trains like a bodybuilder,
you know,

1151
01:09:34.761 --> 01:09:37.670
it's not even like I got to lose five pounds.
It's like,
no,

1152
01:09:37.671 --> 01:09:42.350
I got to put on 10 pounds of muscle and drop 20 pounds of whatever.
But uh,
yeah,

1153
01:09:42.351 --> 01:09:43.190
we're always in the gym.

1154
01:09:43.191 --> 01:09:48.191
Always training the guy that actually trains Stallone for rocky.

1155
01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.690
When I was getting ready to do Ford Fairlane,

1156
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:54.680
I became friends with Stallone and he introduced me to his train.

1157
01:09:54.681 --> 01:09:56.990
And the guy's name is George Pippa sick.

1158
01:09:57.590 --> 01:10:01.370
And the guy was from Czechoslovakia and he was,

1159
01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:04.100
he was missed to Czechoslovakia four years in a row.

1160
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:06.830
And then when steroids came into the business,

1161
01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:10.580
he quit and moved to America and he built,

1162
01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:13.310
he didn't just open a private gym,
he built every,

1163
01:10:13.311 --> 01:10:17.810
he was also a machinist and built every machine in that gym.

1164
01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:23.300
And when this guy really taught me how to change my body,

1165
01:10:23.301 --> 01:10:27.620
when I have to change it had an amplify any muscle,
you know,

1166
01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.940
um,
so with,
with this special,
you know,
I am,

1167
01:10:31.941 --> 01:10:35.720
I'm 54 years old and when I walk out there,

1168
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:39.950
it's almost like when I see certain guys in the crowd that are my age or old,

1169
01:10:39.951 --> 01:10:41.990
and I ask how old they are and they go,
you know,

1170
01:10:41.991 --> 01:10:46.730
I'm 55 years old and I'm looking at the guy like he's 75.
So it's like,

1171
01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.560
I almost want to be hopeful to those people because even as you get older,

1172
01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:55.130
one of the other things I would call myself as like the rocky of comedy.

1173
01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:59.990
Like I'll watch rocky six and go,
that's where I am and that's who I am.

1174
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:02.030
You know?
And you know,

1175
01:11:02.031 --> 01:11:05.600
his messages in those movies about taking your life in,

1176
01:11:05.601 --> 01:11:09.320
reaching your potential is what I always use.
So yeah,

1177
01:11:09.321 --> 01:11:13.620
I could just throw on a leather and walk out there and have a belly sticking
out,

1178
01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:15.540
you know?
But it's like,

1179
01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:20.780
why do that when I'm more than capable of completely restructuring my body and

1180
01:11:22.321 --> 01:11:25.170
giving the fans exactly what they want from it.

1181
01:11:25.171 --> 01:11:28.020
And it makes you feel like you're gearing up for something.
Yeah,
it does.

1182
01:11:28.021 --> 01:11:32.400
You know,
I go up the mountains,
I got her to gym and you know,

1183
01:11:32.650 --> 01:11:34.640
Max had the funniest line.
Uh,

1184
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:39.480
there was this producer in the gym the other day that,
uh,
you know,

1185
01:11:39.481 --> 01:11:43.230
I'm going to get on the treadmill and he got on one of these,
uh,
bouncing things,

1186
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:47.100
you know,
and I go,
why don't you do the workout with me?
You know,
and he goes,

1187
01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.160
you know,
why am I going to work out with you?
And Max is Stan there.

1188
01:11:50.161 --> 01:11:54.330
But this other guy comes over to it works and golds.
Uh,
his name is Travis.

1189
01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.390
And he goes,
because he knows what he's doing.

1190
01:11:57.391 --> 01:12:01.800
And this Guy Travis is what like 30 years old and he's completely ripped.

1191
01:12:01.801 --> 01:12:06.450
He's like six [inaudible] two and he goes,
when I trained with dice,

1192
01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:11.400
I shake when I'm writing the next day he goes,

1193
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:14.820
that's how hard he trains and what he does to each muscle.

1194
01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:18.990
So when Max gets me alone,
he goes,
you know,
cause in the gym,

1195
01:12:18.991 --> 01:12:23.250
like you could be in a tank top,
you're in different clothing.
And Max goes,

1196
01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:27.690
why would this producer even question you?
You have worked out.

1197
01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:32.390
It's on,
you know,
and you know,

1198
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:36.510
it just cracked me up because you know,
people you know,

1199
01:12:36.511 --> 01:12:41.040
look to instead of building up,
they always look to knock you down.

1200
01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:45.870
And I always use those negatives to propel myself.

1201
01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:47.850
See before I walk out on stage,

1202
01:12:47.851 --> 01:12:52.020
I gave Chris rock the same advice before he did bring the pain.

1203
01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:57.540
And it's actually a funny story because I came into the comedy store and Chris

1204
01:12:57.541 --> 01:13:00.800
was on stage,
rehearsing is material and it came to the back and,

1205
01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:04.500
and I mean Chris,
we will bonding is,
we're both from Brooklyn,

1206
01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:07.730
went to the same high school.
I'm like 10 years old and item,

1207
01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:12.570
but we always had that bond.
So I said to Chris,
I go,
uh,
you know what,

1208
01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:14.480
what's going on with your life?
He goes,
well,
you know,

1209
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:16.500
I'm getting ready to do this special phage be,
oh,

1210
01:13:16.501 --> 01:13:19.920
you know how many they're going to get me?
And I look at him and I go,

1211
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:24.600
let me ask you something.
I go with friends,
right?
And he goes,
yeah,
I go,

1212
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:28.890
does it bother you at all that when you leave this club,

1213
01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:31.800
every comic looks at you like a fucking zero.

1214
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:36.210
And he's looking at me going,
why would you say that?
I go,

1215
01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.140
because that's how they look at you.
You're a fucking zero in their eyes.

1216
01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:44.880
You've done nothing or limit Eddie Murphy did for you.
How does that sound?

1217
01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:48.780
That's what they think of you.
He goes,
why would you said I go?

1218
01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:51.390
Because you're standing and talking about a special,

1219
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:56.750
like it's just another special I go when when a network like HBO or showtime

1220
01:13:57.091 --> 01:13:58.200
that give you a special,

1221
01:13:58.410 --> 01:14:01.710
they're giving it to you because that's what they think you are.

1222
01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:05.040
And if you treat it with the attitude,
you just said it to me with,

1223
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:08.130
that's what's going to happen.
Nothing.

1224
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:13.790
I go when you are behind the stage and you're thinking you're going out there in

1225
01:14:14.231 --> 01:14:15.064
two minutes,

1226
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:19.900
think of every comic watching go and he's a fucking zero.

1227
01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.350
And you know what the other side of your brain should be thinking about the

1228
01:14:23.351 --> 01:14:28.300
family that's been back in your ass all these years and they're praying for you

1229
01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:33.220
and you use both those things and start moving around on stage a little because

1230
01:14:33.221 --> 01:14:37.210
you stand there like a fucking soldier and as good as your material is,

1231
01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.490
people are going to fall asleep watching you.

1232
01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:42.610
And that's when he developed that crazy walk back and forth.

1233
01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:45.970
So you coached him into that?
I coached him with that.
Nothing about his material.

1234
01:14:45.971 --> 01:14:49.090
He gave me a thank you on the special,
you know,
and um,

1235
01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:54.590
and he scored and became a big star because he listened.
Because what I do know,

1236
01:14:54.591 --> 01:14:59.260
he listened because what I do understand Joe is about performance because they

1237
01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:02.890
studied rock stars.
I studied the greatest of the greats.

1238
01:15:02.891 --> 01:15:06.640
If it was with the drums,
it was buddy rich.
You know what I mean?

1239
01:15:06.641 --> 01:15:09.780
The greatest drum had ever lived,
but he was doing,
uh,

1240
01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:14.440
shows when he was two years old.
Wow.
You know,
so I studied the greats.

1241
01:15:14.441 --> 01:15:17.110
I didn't study comics because like I keep telling you,

1242
01:15:17.111 --> 01:15:20.260
they bought me to fucking tears.
You know what I mean?
The only one,

1243
01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:24.280
like a Rodney Dangerfield or don Rickles,
when I watched Don Rickles,

1244
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.290
I'm on the floor banging my hands laughing because he's a fucking animal.

1245
01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:34.060
He gets it.
You know what I mean?
Other guys come out there.
Well,
you know,

1246
01:15:34.061 --> 01:15:38.170
I started dating.
I go,
just fucking move.
You know,

1247
01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.370
even with Max when he's performing in Vegas,
I go,
just take a pace,

1248
01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:47.110
grab that Mike and stop pacing a little and they will follow you and they'll be

1249
01:15:47.111 --> 01:15:49.750
with you.
But if you just stand in one spot,

1250
01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:54.280
they're going to get tired and start nodding off just to the sound of a voice.

1251
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.850
It's true.
It's excellent advice.
It is.
Yeah.

1252
01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:00.670
<v 3>Hashi Joey Diaz.
Joey Diaz just stands there.
Yeah.
Well look at them though,</v>

1253
01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:05.280
man.
To the human mountain screaming at an audience.
You're going to pay a 10.

1254
01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:11.130
I love Steve.
You don't,
you know what's so funny about Diaz?
Um,
you know,

1255
01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:15.600
my,
my new wife,
she's a,
she's hair flat and in here,
uh,

1256
01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:19.380
battalion Jewish whenever she is,
but years ago,
you know,

1257
01:16:19.381 --> 01:16:23.550
Diaz was talking about girls and you know,
he's talking about Latin girls.

1258
01:16:23.551 --> 01:16:28.470
He goes,
you don't want that Latin Pussy.
You never want Latin person.
You know,
Eh,

1259
01:16:28.471 --> 01:16:33.100
you know,
like,
oh,
how come?
You know,
he goes,
because you never get out.
You know,

1260
01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.940
he goes,
you never get out the fucking crazy.

1261
01:16:35.941 --> 01:16:38.700
It's the hardest shit on the fucking planet.
Do you understand?

1262
01:16:38.701 --> 01:16:42.960
You don't want to go near that.
This is,
you know,
20 years before I met my wife,

1263
01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:48.120
but now I know what the fuck he's talking about.
That's,
that's classic Joey Diaz.

1264
01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:50.940
Oh No,
he was on those bags.
Get out dog.
No,

1265
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:55.380
he was on the back staircase talking about Cuban food and every other fucking

1266
01:16:55.381 --> 01:16:58.970
food.
Fucking stab you while you're coming.
Yeah,
no.

1267
01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.950
You know what he's right.
Yeah.

1268
01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:05.340
Oh I was talking about of Latina girl that I was dating when I first listened to

1269
01:17:05.341 --> 01:17:09.920
your cassette and I was 19 that bitch was off the charts.
Nothing like it.

1270
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:10.490
Nothing

1271
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:13.370
<v 2>like it.
You know,
I'm married my wife within a year's time.
Wow.</v>

1272
01:17:14.010 --> 01:17:15.920
And we've been happy ever since.
He just said,

1273
01:17:15.921 --> 01:17:19.910
I'll take it other than when we're breaking the house apart,
you know,

1274
01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:23.540
cause at the beginning,
you know,
so,
you know,
it was always funny cause you know,

1275
01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.800
if we got into a fight,
I'm fucking leave and he'd go to bags,
a rolling out,

1276
01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:31.460
I'm throwing them down the stairs,
Max's look in.

1277
01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:35.180
And it got to a point where,
where my sons would be like,
you know what?

1278
01:17:35.181 --> 01:17:38.630
We're not even going to pay attention to this anymore.
How are we breaking out?

1279
01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:42.920
Well,
at the beginning a lot,
you know,
like every other day.
No,
there was,

1280
01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:47.120
there was a couple months stretch up,
but she's the only girl,
you know,

1281
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:49.360
number one,
my wife,
you know,

1282
01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:53.810
knows more about me than me and she's a lot younger than me and she has studied

1283
01:17:53.811 --> 01:17:58.250
it now.
And like she was a dice fan.
No,
she wasn't a dice fan.

1284
01:17:58.330 --> 01:18:01.340
A friend,
when I met her,
her friend knew everything about me,

1285
01:18:01.341 --> 01:18:05.840
but she didn't even know who I was.
So once,
once we started going out,

1286
01:18:05.841 --> 01:18:10.841
she started on the Internet and studying it and she watches every show I do.

1287
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:14.990
And she's the one that got me into the social media with the fucking Twitter

1288
01:18:14.991 --> 01:18:18.710
shit.
You know,
years ago when people would go,
dice,
do you tweet?
I go,

1289
01:18:18.711 --> 01:18:21.860
you know what a pussy.
That's as far as I take it,
you know?
But,

1290
01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.940
but she got me into all that stuff and you know,
she's good with the material.

1291
01:18:25.941 --> 01:18:30.890
I never listened to anybody about material,
you know,
in my whole life,

1292
01:18:30.891 --> 01:18:33.350
any woman I went with,
any,
any friend,

1293
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:38.950
but she actually knows she gets it and she'll give me like little things to say

1294
01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:44.240
and it kills,
you know,
she really just gets what I do and really studies it.

1295
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:48.000
That's hilarious.
So she's almost like she can be a writer too.
Well,

1296
01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:51.380
cause she knows you so well.
She,
she's my number one fan.

1297
01:18:51.381 --> 01:18:55.440
She's my groupie and she's the only one I want.
Trust me.
You know,

1298
01:18:56.450 --> 01:19:01.280
you've met her,
she's great.
She's great.
Valerie,
I hope you're listening.
So,

1299
01:19:01.281 --> 01:19:04.890
uh,
she's also on a Twitter under miss dice clay.
Yeah.

1300
01:19:04.891 --> 01:19:09.500
She loves being Mrs Dice Clay.
She loves it,
you know.
Yeah.

1301
01:19:09.501 --> 01:19:13.820
She sells,
she does the merchandise at the shows.
Oh yeah.
That's awesome.

1302
01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:16.490
And like I'll talk about my Latin wife.
I go,
yeah,

1303
01:19:16.491 --> 01:19:19.880
you know that the day after we got married,
a mother moves in.

1304
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:25.110
Then the father and the 90 cousins come,
90 cousins,

1305
01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:27.510
half of them are and cousins.
And I'm going to,
oh,

1306
01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:30.350
I know it's helped my fucking truck is missing,
you know,

1307
01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:35.480
but she's got the greatest family.
I carry a picture of a model,

1308
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:41.060
which is a step w where's my beer?
I got to show him this.
This is an,

1309
01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:44.710
I don't have a picture of my wife on me.
So your,
Twitter's the real dice clay,

1310
01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:49.730
the real dice clay.
Anything else is not.
Um,
is that your fanny pack?
Yeah,

1311
01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.300
I have my little love fake bag.
I enjoy the fanny pack.

1312
01:19:53.301 --> 01:19:56.900
And I'm proud of you for sporting one as well.
The list.
Yeah,

1313
01:19:56.901 --> 01:20:01.810
it's a great way.
In a nice picture.
I carry of a month,
take a look.

1314
01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:07.390
Oh wait,
where's the mother?
Is The mum?
There's Mama seat.
The senior

1315
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.330
<v 4>as May.
Look how handsome</v>

1316
01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:16.140
for my wife will see that sugar.
You took out the wrinkled picture.

1317
01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:19.980
Ford Fairline used to be.
But I gotta tell you this though,

1318
01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:22.260
because obviously you're friends with Eleanor.

1319
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:27.180
Eleanor's like my extra wife and um,
you know,
so she,

1320
01:20:27.181 --> 01:20:28.950
she also opens the shows for me.

1321
01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.770
So anytime there's a problem with me and Eleanor.

1322
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:37.070
Eleanor goes to my wife and now I got to get it in the dressing room from the

1323
01:20:37.081 --> 01:20:41.760
two of them.
Max has witnessed this.
It's hysterical.
You hang up on them.

1324
01:20:42.090 --> 01:20:47.060
They do.
Does he enjoy it a little bit?
Yeah.
Yeah because I see,
you know,

1325
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:51.180
they both have different towns.
Like you know,
I told you about my neck,
you know,

1326
01:20:51.181 --> 01:20:54.840
my wife's a little lazy about it cause she's got like fingernails like longer

1327
01:20:54.841 --> 01:20:56.490
than your foot,
you know?

1328
01:20:56.491 --> 01:21:00.330
And they're always like different things whenever she does.
But Eleanor,

1329
01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:05.040
she south Philly,
so she gets in there with the elbows,
you know what I mean?

1330
01:21:05.041 --> 01:21:08.790
So it'd be like,
oh no,
you've got to work on me tonight.
You know what I mean?

1331
01:21:08.791 --> 01:21:11.840
And she'll like dig in for a good hour.
So yeah,

1332
01:21:11.850 --> 01:21:15.570
it's all different styles from a lifting your your back.
Yeah.

1333
01:21:15.571 --> 01:21:19.200
I just always had a bad neck and back.
Do you stretch a lot?
No,

1334
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:22.080
I don't stretch enough.
I know,
I bet you told me that.
Yeah.

1335
01:21:22.081 --> 01:21:23.310
It's also your hamstrings.

1336
01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:26.460
A lot of times when people are experiencing pain and tightness in their back,

1337
01:21:26.461 --> 01:21:29.160
it really has a lot to do with your hamstrings,
you know,
uh,

1338
01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:31.680
if you don't have a flexible back,
um,
you know,

1339
01:21:31.681 --> 01:21:34.140
you gotta think about all the different ways your back do stretch.

1340
01:21:34.141 --> 01:21:37.020
I just don't stretch and a strong as I should.
I stretch a lot,

1341
01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:42.180
especially as you get older,
single view in one of the,
uh,
martial arts magazines,

1342
01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:45.150
like doing the split.
Yeah,
I can do that.

1343
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:48.450
And that's when I decided never have a problem with,

1344
01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:54.080
never have a problem with him.
He knows too much flexibilities.

1345
01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.730
The one of the most important things as you get older,
especially,

1346
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:59.550
you've got to really,
it's something you have to do,
like brushing your teeth.

1347
01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:00.690
If you don't brush your teeth,
you know,

1348
01:22:00.691 --> 01:22:03.780
you can go to bed and not brush your teeth for a few fucking months and nothing

1349
01:22:03.781 --> 01:22:05.910
really will happen except you get bad breath.

1350
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:08.490
But you got to think about stretching like that.
It's like,
it's a,

1351
01:22:08.491 --> 01:22:11.910
it's an important piece of body maintenance,
especially as you get older.

1352
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.020
And then as you're younger,

1353
01:22:13.021 --> 01:22:14.940
especially if you're younger and you're lifting weights,

1354
01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:17.700
there's a lot of people that fucked their body up because they lift weights and

1355
01:22:17.701 --> 01:22:21.180
I don't stretch out.
You got to make sure you get a full range of motion.

1356
01:22:21.210 --> 01:22:25.530
Do you still talking about that?
Do you actually still fight?
I still do Jujitsu.

1357
01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.680
I do Jiu Jitsu sparring,
you know,
I don't,

1358
01:22:27.681 --> 01:22:30.020
I don't know any kickbox anymore because a,

1359
01:22:30.021 --> 01:22:32.940
I hit the bag and I work with trainers and hit the pads and stuff.

1360
01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:36.810
But sparring is not good for your brain because you're an interesting guy.

1361
01:22:36.811 --> 01:22:40.470
I mean you,
you went,
I mean that to learn what,
what degree are you,

1362
01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:43.890
oh well I stopped taking taekwondo,

1363
01:22:43.891 --> 01:22:46.590
which was the martial arts that I first got my black belt.

1364
01:22:46.591 --> 01:22:49.260
Then when I was a second degree and I stopped because I started getting into

1365
01:22:49.261 --> 01:22:52.390
kickboxing,
I started getting into Moy Thai.
So I,

1366
01:22:52.391 --> 01:22:56.340
I missed mixed all this other stuff in with the taekwondo and sort of changed my

1367
01:22:56.341 --> 01:22:57.510
whole style and kicking.

1368
01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.090
So that was the last time I was ever ranked was a second degree.

1369
01:23:00.091 --> 01:23:04.110
So let me ask you,
cause you also do like an aggressive show,
you know,

1370
01:23:04.111 --> 01:23:06.220
as a comic do you get,
because

1371
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:07.450
<v 0>people know that about you.</v>

1372
01:23:07.451 --> 01:23:11.980
Do you get fucked with like that know the people that come in with shows are so

1373
01:23:11.981 --> 01:23:16.030
fucking friendly.
I have no problems.
Everyone's so nice man.

1374
01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:19.420
We have a a friendly podcast.
It's a fun podcast,
you know,

1375
01:23:19.690 --> 01:23:24.340
and I do martial arts and I've started doing martial arts for two reasons.

1376
01:23:24.341 --> 01:23:27.550
One because I was picked on when I was younger and I didn't like it and I didn't

1377
01:23:27.551 --> 01:23:30.070
have an older brother and my stepfather was hardly ever around.

1378
01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:33.400
So I had a fight and I didn't like it.
I didn't like people fucking with me.

1379
01:23:33.401 --> 01:23:35.530
So I learned how to fight.
It was really that simple.

1380
01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:37.270
Then once I got really good at it,

1381
01:23:37.271 --> 01:23:41.710
I did it because I think martial arts is the most dangerous,

1382
01:23:41.711 --> 01:23:45.040
challenging and character building path for human development.

1383
01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:47.830
And I think to really know about yourself,

1384
01:23:47.831 --> 01:23:50.430
there's two ways you could go to war and you can find out about yourself

1385
01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:54.010
shooting people overseas,
fighting hand to hand combat and fucking ditch.

1386
01:23:54.010 --> 01:23:55.000
And stab a guy with a knife.

1387
01:23:55.001 --> 01:23:56.950
You can find out a lot about yourself in that situation.

1388
01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:00.280
Or you could travel around the country and fighting martial arts tournaments.

1389
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:04.810
You can do that and you can find out an incredible amount about your tolerance

1390
01:24:04.811 --> 01:24:07.750
to pain.
You're willing to push through adversity.

1391
01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:11.290
That's what would get me nuts with you though.
That's what the joke was for me.

1392
01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:16.210
Because I know with martial arts they,
it's all the bind Dan body.

1393
01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:20.110
Yeah.
So when I would see you like lose it.
Oh yeah.
I'd be like,

1394
01:24:20.290 --> 01:24:23.110
isn't this guy supposed to be like zen?

1395
01:24:24.210 --> 01:24:27.370
You know when I'm starting it,
I'm bad at it for two,
two times,

1396
01:24:27.371 --> 01:24:30.520
one from drinking and someone's just talking shit and they're being aggressive.

1397
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:34.750
I get,
they teach you to just say,
Oh,
I'm way better at it now.

1398
01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:36.160
Way better at it now.
But the,

1399
01:24:36.161 --> 01:24:38.860
the real problem I would always have two prompts in.

1400
01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:41.500
The biggest one was when I saw someone bullying someone,

1401
01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:44.410
that shit would drive me fucking crazy.

1402
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:48.580
It drives me crazy when I see someone bullies.
You know what?
That's how I am too.

1403
01:24:48.581 --> 01:24:51.040
I was never like,
I fucking hate it.
You know?

1404
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:53.980
It was never about like being being a bully.

1405
01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:59.010
It was just being able to protect myself and I would also hate when I saw people

1406
01:24:59.891 --> 01:25:01.810
get fucked with like that.

1407
01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.380
I understand where you're coming from that that was the,
the hot point,

1408
01:25:05.410 --> 01:25:06.880
the one store that you were talking about,

1409
01:25:06.881 --> 01:25:08.470
words screaming at this guy in front of the club.

1410
01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:11.500
He was threatening that he was going to kill one of the guys that worked there.

1411
01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:12.773
He was just,

1412
01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:15.460
they were kicking them out of the club because he was drunk and he was saying he

1413
01:25:15.461 --> 01:25:17.530
was gonna kick my ass and I didn't think anything of it.

1414
01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:21.430
But then I got off stage and my friends worried and he's in the front of the

1415
01:25:21.431 --> 01:25:23.320
club.
He's like,
that fucking guy still out here,
man.

1416
01:25:23.321 --> 01:25:24.460
He's saying he's gonna kill me.

1417
01:25:24.461 --> 01:25:28.780
He's saying he just got back from my rack and I just,
I just,
I just couldn't,

1418
01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:31.300
I saw red and I was like,
I'm going to beat this.

1419
01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:33.550
I saw you weren't going to hit him or anything,

1420
01:25:33.551 --> 01:25:36.490
but I just found that was trying to get them to hit me.
But,
but no,

1421
01:25:36.491 --> 01:25:40.270
I know that that's all I was trying to get that I just wanting to it that I was

1422
01:25:40.271 --> 01:25:43.330
there for them and see if I,
well,
that was totally different.
That was,

1423
01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.280
I didn't want to hurt.
No,
I know that.

1424
01:25:45.281 --> 01:25:49.300
But it was so beautiful because you were like,
if the mic was his nose,

1425
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:53.140
you will right here.
It was so cool.
You know?

1426
01:25:53.141 --> 01:25:55.960
And everybody knew that when sia was a different case.

1427
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:59.710
He's a guy who unfortunately has some sort of a psychological issue.

1428
01:25:59.711 --> 01:26:00.820
I don't know what it was,

1429
01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:04.190
but we had this guy that was around the comedy community that wasn't like

1430
01:26:04.191 --> 01:26:05.300
everybody else and he was,

1431
01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:08.420
he would literally go right on before you didn't do your best bed.

1432
01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:10.490
Say if you had a bit about a,
you know,

1433
01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:12.200
fucking hitting your computer with a hammer.

1434
01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.460
He would open with his version of your hitting the computer with a hammer bed.

1435
01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:19.070
I mean,
it was just,
he was,
it was aggressive in it.

1436
01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:22.130
It wasn't just that he was trying to do good for himself.

1437
01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:25.130
He was also trying to shut you down.
It's trying to step on your material.

1438
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:28.040
It was a real,
real fucking big problem.

1439
01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:32.050
But even still then I never tried to hit that guy.
Never know.
I know.
I know.

1440
01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:36.530
I was there that night with the argument.
What was so crazy is Max that night,

1441
01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:40.190
it was like men see it like they advertise them that he's going to be performing

1442
01:26:40.191 --> 01:26:45.100
there.
So it's so impersonal.
That's a,
that's the,
yeah,

1443
01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:48.770
he comes up.
But I was there when it happened,
you know what I mean?
It was,
well,

1444
01:26:48.771 --> 01:26:52.610
every,
you know,
there's so many comics in the room that were backing me up.

1445
01:26:52.611 --> 01:26:57.260
I felt like I was representing them as much as though you was.
It was,
it was.

1446
01:26:57.261 --> 01:27:02.000
We were so sick and tired of it by that time,
you know?
And if it wasn't for,
uh,

1447
01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:04.160
you know,
Brian catching it on video,

1448
01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:06.830
that that guy probably would have pulled that off for another couple of years

1449
01:27:06.831 --> 01:27:09.950
and victimized a bunch of other guys and it ain't good for him either.
Man.

1450
01:27:09.951 --> 01:27:12.330
He's a talented performer.
You know what?
I do his own thing.

1451
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:14.420
You know what I always told Max?
I go,

1452
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:18.800
if you're truthful up there and write your own material,
you got to Korea.

1453
01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:21.890
You don't want it depend on other people to write immaterial.

1454
01:27:21.891 --> 01:27:26.660
So just use your mind and when you're on stage,
just let it go.
You know?

1455
01:27:26.690 --> 01:27:31.070
That's,
that's all you got to do.
And he's getting better and better at it.
And uh,

1456
01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:35.180
you know,
to specialty is going to do something else.
But you know,

1457
01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:37.790
did you talk to Joe about your dramas and all that?

1458
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:40.020
I brought up the drums on the last day and you'll never

1459
01:27:42.930 --> 01:27:46.610
do a podcast sometime.
Like maybe play some songs or something.
No,
no.

1460
01:27:46.611 --> 01:27:48.230
But he'll be on the special,

1461
01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:52.520
he's going to do a huge thing on the drums because he's like untouchable dice,

1462
01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:57.320
podcast,
dices view on the world.
I would subscribe to it.

1463
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:58.940
I guarantee you millions of people.

1464
01:27:58.941 --> 01:28:01.430
You'd probably have the number one podcast in the country.
I would,

1465
01:28:01.431 --> 01:28:03.080
I would tell people immediately,
go get it.
Yeah.

1466
01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:06.710
I don't know if I get the discipline to do this.
It's fucking easy.

1467
01:28:07.150 --> 01:28:09.380
Whenever you want a cigarette,
you drank a cup of coffee.

1468
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:12.110
They just started talking shit about Chris Brown.
It's that simple.

1469
01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.160
It's that simple.

1470
01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:16.390
You press record and you can have an engineer who come to your house and Max

1471
01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:17.180
always tells me,
you know what?

1472
01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:19.970
I should start the podcast and then just have my dad on it.

1473
01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:23.420
How about you two guys do a podcast together?
Brian,

1474
01:28:23.421 --> 01:28:26.780
we'll produce it and they'll put it out for you.
Just come here once,

1475
01:28:26.781 --> 01:28:29.540
twice a week or once a week?
Once every two weeks.

1476
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:32.600
What do you do on the road though,
Ma on the road and I'll do anything.

1477
01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:34.070
I just promote my gigs though.

1478
01:28:34.071 --> 01:28:37.940
I don't you do radio anymore radio when they're my friends radio shows.

1479
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.120
How do people know when you're going to be on on the podcast?

1480
01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.600
While the podcast is at least two or three times a week.
We do it.

1481
01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:47.870
We put it out on Twitter.
We tell people in advance,
you know,
hey,

1482
01:28:47.871 --> 01:28:51.770
Monday is going to be chill son in Tuesday's going to be Michael Rupert.

1483
01:28:51.771 --> 01:28:53.660
That's the schedule for next week.
And if they miss it,

1484
01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:55.070
they can download it on iTunes.

1485
01:28:55.071 --> 01:28:56.720
And one of the things I was thinking that you should do,

1486
01:28:56.721 --> 01:29:00.080
cause I know that a Ford Fairlane doesn't have a DVD commentary and it would be

1487
01:29:00.081 --> 01:29:01.980
really funny if you just did a podcast

1488
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:05.880
<v 4>watching Ford Fairlane so people at home could hit start at the same time.</v>

1489
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.640
And you're just talking about the movie.

1490
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:13.410
<v 2>They asked me,
I wouldn't do the commentary for it.
Whatever.
You did it though.
No,</v>

1491
01:29:13.411 --> 01:29:14.221
but I'm saying why?

1492
01:29:14.221 --> 01:29:18.690
Because this was a movie that could have gone through the roof and they pulled

1493
01:29:18.691 --> 01:29:23.691
in in a week and it was doing big numbers and because of what happened with Fox

1494
01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:28.140
20th Century Fox put it out,
they,
they played the movie for a week.

1495
01:29:28.170 --> 01:29:31.770
I had to go see it on Hollywood boulevard.
That's how I saw afford fairly.

1496
01:29:31.771 --> 01:29:34.740
So it was doing really well and they pulled the chest that time.

1497
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.730
You got to understand this thing came out in 1990 so you know,

1498
01:29:38.731 --> 01:29:42.450
an opening weekend for that movie today would be like,
you know,

1499
01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.000
$45 million.
You know,

1500
01:29:45.001 --> 01:29:49.560
back then it was like an $18 million opening weekend cause you know the price it

1501
01:29:49.561 --> 01:29:54.561
costs to go into a movie theater and it got this big hit even though they didn't

1502
01:29:55.171 --> 01:29:58.170
do the premia.
And then they pulled it in a week.

1503
01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:02.490
And what happened with that movie is then they added all around the world.

1504
01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:06.810
So they made a ton of money with it.
Then at that time there were no DVDs.

1505
01:30:06.811 --> 01:30:11.270
It was just tapes.
It was just videotapes.
And the month that it came out for,

1506
01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:15.270
you know how years ago,
uh,
it was like $2 to rent the tape.

1507
01:30:15.690 --> 01:30:18.270
But if you kept the tape,
it was like a hundred dollars.

1508
01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:23.940
The first month that came out,
they sold at the hundred dollar price.

1509
01:30:23.941 --> 01:30:27.840
400,000 units.
Wow.
Wow.
So it was like,

1510
01:30:27.841 --> 01:30:31.710
by the time they called me years later to do commentary,
I was like,

1511
01:30:31.711 --> 01:30:32.520
you know what?

1512
01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:35.550
You pulled my movie out of the theater is why would I do commentary about it?

1513
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.260
You know what I mean?
I didn't care.

1514
01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:41.250
<v 4>Yeah,
no,
I could see it from that point of view.
From a fan's point of view.</v>

1515
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:43.290
People would love it,
especially if he did it for yourself instead.

1516
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:47.790
We always still talk about a sequel to it because it has the audience.

1517
01:30:47.970 --> 01:30:50.400
It always had the order.
You do a podcast,

1518
01:30:50.401 --> 01:30:53.790
I guarantee you how many people would watch that fucking thing with with you

1519
01:30:53.791 --> 01:30:57.450
doing it by failing,
you'll give me all your information.

1520
01:30:57.451 --> 01:31:01.930
Would you be able to play legally play for talk over it.
You don't even have to.

1521
01:31:01.931 --> 01:31:04.500
You just like it because what you're doing to watch it at home,

1522
01:31:04.570 --> 01:31:08.120
you just have it in the background playing,
so like,
oh,
I see,

1523
01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:12.630
so you get people to press play and watch the movie at the same time so they

1524
01:31:12.631 --> 01:31:16.200
have his commentary on the laptop or something.
Yeah,
exactly.
Absolutely.

1525
01:31:16.290 --> 01:31:19.080
That's ultra crowd.
Tell you one thing.
I had a blast and we've done it all.

1526
01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:21.630
We do it with the UFC drunk castle.
Oh,
that's right,
that's right.

1527
01:31:21.631 --> 01:31:24.120
I had a blessed stow in that movie.
I'll tell you that much.

1528
01:31:24.121 --> 01:31:26.880
That was a fun movie to date.
By the way,
Brian,
before I say anything,

1529
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:30.540
there's a UFC coming up soon and we should do that because I'm not doing it.

1530
01:31:30.541 --> 01:31:33.180
It's one of those FX shows.
Let's do a draw the Australia one.

1531
01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:36.720
No it's not Australia.
Um,
let me find out what the card is.

1532
01:31:36.721 --> 01:31:40.080
I think they think it's soon.
I think it's like Tuesday.
Let's do it.

1533
01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:44.040
I think it's next Tuesday in high school.
That was my favorite movie ever.

1534
01:31:44.041 --> 01:31:47.970
And I had your poster above for the movie above my bed.

1535
01:31:47.971 --> 01:31:51.090
Cause I used to work at a movie theater and one of my favorite shit was like,

1536
01:31:51.091 --> 01:31:54.330
just the ridiculousness of it.
Like when you fell off the building,
like my hair,

1537
01:31:54.331 --> 01:31:58.130
my hair,
it's like this silly shit.
I would quote quote,

1538
01:31:58.131 --> 01:32:00.070
you have my most of my life,
they let me do

1539
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.850
<v 2>my thing in the movie.
It was a fun movie to do.
I thought it was a great movie,</v>

1540
01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:08.970
but you know,
with,
with everything surrounding it,
it wasn't fun.
Yeah.
You know,

1541
01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:09.880
even like,
you know,

1542
01:32:09.881 --> 01:32:14.881
they had me go on a Saturday night live before the movie came out and you know,

1543
01:32:16.201 --> 01:32:20.190
that everybody was walking off the show.
You know,
I don't even want to say it,

1544
01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:23.230
stupid girls name and uh,
you know,

1545
01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:28.210
it just started like nothing I got to do was a pleasant experience,
you know,

1546
01:32:28.211 --> 01:32:31.600
so,
you know,
that's,
but that was then,
you know,
and the,

1547
01:32:31.601 --> 01:32:35.320
and the beauty of being around today and still doing what I do is that I

1548
01:32:35.321 --> 01:32:39.220
survived all that stuff.
You know,
cause a lot of people would have followed it.

1549
01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:43.300
I don't fall for anything.
I always,
I always just keep going,
you know,

1550
01:32:43.301 --> 01:32:46.480
and I always find the way back one way or another when we were talking about

1551
01:32:46.481 --> 01:32:50.050
like the period where you had nothing going on until entourage puts you back on

1552
01:32:50.051 --> 01:32:54.100
again.
You know,
did you try some stuff that didn't work or did you like,

1553
01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:59.520
I did a reality show about seven years ago and you know with all these tapes,

1554
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.570
you know these producers at Fox TV,

1555
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:08.680
they saw my tapes and they said this is a show,
you know,

1556
01:33:08.681 --> 01:33:13.480
so they sold it to VH one and then when,

1557
01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:17.200
and the way I would fill myself is that it could be cut together and they got

1558
01:33:17.201 --> 01:33:19.810
picked up for seven shows and I said,

1559
01:33:19.811 --> 01:33:23.530
why don't you guys just take these tapes and cut it together?

1560
01:33:24.010 --> 01:33:25.600
But they had a budget,
they had a,

1561
01:33:25.601 --> 01:33:30.550
it was like they got like 315 grand an episode and I said,

1562
01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:34.240
all you need is editors,
you know,
and I'll do some voice of,
I go,

1563
01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:38.340
you have the show.
I have filmed my life,
you know,
I was filming heaven,

1564
01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:42.790
which you saw me do that all the time,
you know?
And they go,
no,
we have ideas.

1565
01:33:42.791 --> 01:33:47.170
And as they're shooting these ideas,
even my kids were like,
what are they doing?

1566
01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:49.960
And they came over with this episode,
a rough cut,

1567
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:53.620
what they called the image episode and you know,

1568
01:33:53.621 --> 01:33:58.240
they put like a grill in my mouth and dressed me like a rapper and I hated it.

1569
01:33:58.750 --> 01:33:59.583
I hated it.

1570
01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:03.850
I was young and I forgot if it was either Max a Dylan that looked at the

1571
01:34:03.851 --> 01:34:07.570
producers and said,
if you were doing a show would axl rose,

1572
01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:09.310
wouldn't you just let them be axle?

1573
01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:14.380
So why don't you just let dice be dice instead of making up all this bullshit.

1574
01:34:14.410 --> 01:34:17.740
I just remembered you were in foolish.
Oh,
that's right.

1575
01:34:19.210 --> 01:34:23.380
That's right.
One of my favorite crazy Eddie Griffin movies,

1576
01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:27.280
Eddie Griffin in full prime.
Crazy for him.
Those are a about,

1577
01:34:27.281 --> 01:34:31.110
he played a comic named foolish ways.
You were like the club owner,
right?
Yeah,

1578
01:34:31.810 --> 01:34:35.440
Eddie Griffin.
Man.
There was,
there was a kid who had some fucking talent.

1579
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:38.320
There was,
there was moments where that kid would be on stage just crushing.

1580
01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:38.990
Like I,

1581
01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:42.100
I thought Eddie Griffin at one point in time was going to be one of the biggest

1582
01:34:42.101 --> 01:34:44.950
acts like ever in the country.
I thought Eddie Griffin,
you know,

1583
01:34:45.130 --> 01:34:48.340
I sort of found that a,
and you found him?

1584
01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:52.060
Well what happened was I was at the comedy store one night and he walks over to

1585
01:34:52.061 --> 01:34:56.560
me and he goes,
I'm going to open for you one day.
And you know,

1586
01:34:56.561 --> 01:35:00.710
I know we talked for two minutes and then a couple weeks later I was getting

1587
01:35:00.711 --> 01:35:05.711
ready to go on tour and I already had opening acts and Eddie was on stage and he

1588
01:35:06.171 --> 01:35:09.320
had like,
you know,
2% material.

1589
01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:15.020
But what he had,
he was exciting to watch,
you know what I mean?

1590
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:19.940
So he came offstage and I said,
you know,
come over here,
you know,
I said,

1591
01:35:19.941 --> 01:35:23.180
you know what,
I saw you on stage tonight and I said,

1592
01:35:23.210 --> 01:35:26.660
you really do have that potential,
you're going to be great.
I said,

1593
01:35:26.661 --> 01:35:28.970
so why don't you go pack your bags and we leave in the morning.

1594
01:35:28.971 --> 01:35:33.260
It was the dice rule store,
you know.
And the next thing you know,

1595
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:35.510
we're in Philadelphia.
I'm doing,

1596
01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:39.380
I was going to do I think two nights at the spectrum and you know,

1597
01:35:39.381 --> 01:35:43.880
I see that he doesn't have a coat,
no socks and the snow on the ground.

1598
01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:48.050
I go,
where's all your stuff?
He goes,
I don't have anything.

1599
01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:52.490
So next thing you know,
we're on a shopping spree and he gives me the nickname,

1600
01:35:52.491 --> 01:35:54.920
uncle dice to this day.
You know,

1601
01:35:54.930 --> 01:35:58.310
cause I just saw him in Vegas last week and yeah,

1602
01:35:58.311 --> 01:36:01.970
I bought them all these clothes and he did a lot of that tour with me.

1603
01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:04.790
Was He in the movie?
He was in dice rolls,

1604
01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:08.930
is seen in dice rolls and he was great.
You know,
he had to do,

1605
01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:12.920
is take where he's yelling at me in a gas station.
I was like doing,
you know,

1606
01:36:12.921 --> 01:36:16.670
before it turned into dice,
I'm doing like my own version of like a nerd.

1607
01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:21.140
But I was really doing my impersonation of Max,
who was a baby at the time,

1608
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:25.880
you know,
and you know,
Eddie Griffin screaming at me in a,
in a,

1609
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:30.680
in a gas station,
she rips off like with the,
uh,
the,
the windshield wiper.

1610
01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:34.640
It's gone.
Motherfuck is like,
Yo,
it's just taking them away from a black man.

1611
01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:37.190
And I'm sitting there going,
yeah,
they Kiki,
you know,

1612
01:36:37.191 --> 01:36:39.140
and you got to say what mother fucker.

1613
01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:42.770
And then he gets in the car and he's screaming at me and he was great.

1614
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:47.080
He was great.
Big Low.
He can act as fuck Eddie's,

1615
01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:51.350
Eddie's got a lot of talent,
a lot of talent,
a lot of crazy,
a lot of talent.

1616
01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:55.400
But he'll admit to that.
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
It's the twice fun to be around.

1617
01:36:55.830 --> 01:37:00.820
He's a great guy,
you know,
but you know,
he,
he is a great,
a great talent.
You know,

1618
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:01.491
and you know,

1619
01:37:01.491 --> 01:37:06.491
at that time he'd come onstage twirling of Bhutan with a big top hat top hat,

1620
01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:12.620
you know,
making the crowd going,
uh,
hey motherfucker.
Hey motherfucker.
Hey.

1621
01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:16.020
And then he didn't know what he was going to do once the music stop,
you know,

1622
01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:19.250
but he had a couple of bits and,
and he would kill the crowd.
He did great.

1623
01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:20.270
He's a great performer.

1624
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:23.150
And I remember his first special that he did and say he did.

1625
01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:28.040
I think he did an HBO half hour and uh,
he was like,
he had shorts on.
Yeah.

1626
01:37:28.041 --> 01:37:31.390
That's where he would do to Michael Jackson and prince and Gus.

1627
01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:35.270
Was it a half an hour?
I don't know if that was a half hour.

1628
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:39.010
You're talking about the one where he's wearing like the big yellow.
Yeah,

1629
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:42.380
that was good.
That was strong.
Fucking strong.

1630
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:46.940
And then I did try to train him for another special,

1631
01:37:46.941 --> 01:37:51.260
like a one hour HB out thing and he didn't listen.

1632
01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:55.950
You know what I mean?
Cause I said first we trained physically,
then we train.
Oh,

1633
01:37:55.951 --> 01:37:56.070
you

1634
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:59.190
<v 4>want to work out with them?
Yeah.
So,
so he went up the mountain,</v>

1635
01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:02.820
he went up this mountain with me and he goes right after the mountain,

1636
01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:06.420
we're going to go to the gym,
you know,
and then halfway up the mountain,

1637
01:38:06.421 --> 01:38:10.920
he's like,
fuck this.
And then the next day when I'm calling him,
you know,

1638
01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:14.010
he's not even returning the call.
There he is right there.

1639
01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:18.320
He's a hell of a can they hear him?
He can make

1640
01:38:19.710 --> 01:38:20.521
<v 6>the falls.</v>

1641
01:38:20.521 --> 01:38:25.470
Didn't do it yesterday and a nose camera couldn't shut the shit off quick
enough.

1642
01:38:25.890 --> 01:38:28.560
You could see what the motherfucker was thanking.

1643
01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:31.980
His brain's hit the ground.
I said,
look at him.

1644
01:38:31.981 --> 01:38:36.981
He was begging about killing himself yet did dumb motherfucker.

1645
01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:42.720
Y'All saying what?
Only white people do shit and shit like that.

1646
01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:46.370
You know they have problems and shit and they flip.

1647
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:48.360
<v 4>You got the camera man in the background.</v>

1648
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:52.980
Great job director and they can fuck it.
You're fired but a stupid shot.

1649
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:56.190
That's the stupidest shot I've ever seen.
Any of the comedy special.

1650
01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:59.610
I talk about a shot that brings you away from the special.

1651
01:38:59.670 --> 01:39:03.660
See a guy with a fucking heads and on a camera behind them.
That's so stupid.

1652
01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:07.370
They have a shot of the audience that could have used their hand away.

1653
01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:09.850
The shit of it.

1654
01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:13.620
Look at what's making you mad today.

1655
01:39:15.630 --> 01:39:18.210
This is the first moment of you like getting heated up.

1656
01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:21.950
You want to hurt that guy?
I want to hurt them.
Show director.

1657
01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:25.470
I want to talk to the director.
The Violin Day.
Did you see the new Avengers?

1658
01:39:25.471 --> 01:39:30.060
Maybe Joe did you like?
It was fucking amazing when the hug grabs that,

1659
01:39:30.061 --> 01:39:33.450
that guy had smashes them into the ground.
Me,
I didn't see the movie.
Yeah.

1660
01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:37.620
It doesn't matter.
I won't say anymore,
but it's fucking tremendous.

1661
01:39:37.621 --> 01:39:41.340
The Hawk is amazing.
Yeah,
man.
They got to do a new hulk movie.

1662
01:39:41.341 --> 01:39:43.750
And what's the guy's name that plays the hawk?
What's the actors?

1663
01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:46.280
I don't know his name.
I still can't get this.

1664
01:39:47.370 --> 01:39:49.830
Can't get past how friendly your audiences are.
Oh,

1665
01:39:49.831 --> 01:39:53.970
they're the nicest audiences ever.
They're super friendly.
Yeah.
You got bizarre.

1666
01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:58.020
But I,
I'm a nice guy still.
You know?
I know you were a nice guy,

1667
01:39:58.021 --> 01:39:59.820
but when you're doing your stage thing,

1668
01:39:59.850 --> 01:40:04.850
I've seen it enough times to know because my audience is the most aggressive

1669
01:40:05.011 --> 01:40:07.740
audience I've ever seen from anybody mean.

1670
01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:12.840
I'm not even talking about comics.
I'm talking even rock shows.
Yeah,

1671
01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:17.010
they're there.
They're there to go nuts.
You know?

1672
01:40:17.370 --> 01:40:21.150
Did they had to go crazy?
That's why it's about controlling the crowd.
Half of it,

1673
01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:25.710
my dad's audience,
the only audience that ever heckles me.

1674
01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.010
I never get heckled anywhere.
People are always cool.

1675
01:40:29.310 --> 01:40:31.020
Whenever I opened for my dad,

1676
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:36.350
I know I have to do with dirty your set and he has to attend a more hardcore set

1677
01:40:36.961 --> 01:40:39.570
and just the hardcore,
this is just out of respect.

1678
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:41.280
The actor's name is Mark Rufallo.

1679
01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:45.450
That's the guy who plays the Hawk fucking tremendous actor.
Yeah,

1680
01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:47.820
I would imagine you have pretty aggressive crowds.

1681
01:40:47.850 --> 01:40:50.880
The once an event's going to see a dice show is not just going to see a regular

1682
01:40:50.881 --> 01:40:54.100
comedy show like the,
this tossed around in the must be pretty intense.

1683
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:57.190
<v 3>It's insanity.
It's like he's leading an angry mob of people.</v>

1684
01:40:57.370 --> 01:41:02.350
It's not even like about laughter.
Tell,
tell him,

1685
01:41:02.410 --> 01:41:05.800
tell him,
tell him I was playing this set for him because like I said,

1686
01:41:05.801 --> 01:41:08.940
I'm going around the country testing everything and uh,

1687
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:10.030
I was playing the set from,

1688
01:41:10.031 --> 01:41:15.031
I just did the Burgin Center in Jersey and so we sat down late at night to

1689
01:41:15.191 --> 01:41:19.450
listen to this set for a few minutes and we shut it off.
And Mexico's,

1690
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:24.580
now I know why the government and everybody else had a problem with you.
He goes,

1691
01:41:24.910 --> 01:41:28.480
it sounds like this angry mob.

1692
01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:33.730
And it would be scary to government,
you know,

1693
01:41:33.731 --> 01:41:37.550
because of what he's saying and the way they're reacting to it anyway.

1694
01:41:37.551 --> 01:41:40.540
That's why government officials can be like,
I don't know what this,

1695
01:41:40.570 --> 01:41:42.840
and it's the dumbest Shit I could think of.

1696
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:47.830
I mean some of it that there is no thought that goes into it.

1697
01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:51.310
Um,
as far as,
you know,
certain bits,

1698
01:41:51.311 --> 01:41:53.560
like I don't do my homework as well.

1699
01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:57.880
I just want to do the bit in the funniest way I can.
I don't care if it's,

1700
01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:02.260
if it's got any kind of truth to it.
Sometimes,
you know,

1701
01:42:02.261 --> 01:42:06.070
it's just gotta be,
there are certain bits that are truthful,

1702
01:42:06.190 --> 01:42:10.150
but certain bits I'm doing just to affect them and make them laugh their balls

1703
01:42:10.151 --> 01:42:10.750
off.

1704
01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:15.750
That when I see a guy banging his fists on the stage and his head's laying on

1705
01:42:15.971 --> 01:42:19.930
the stage that he can laugh anymore,
I know I'm doing my job,

1706
01:42:20.590 --> 01:42:23.710
you know,
that,
that's how I look at that and I come off and I go,

1707
01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:26.410
did you see them?
You know,

1708
01:42:26.710 --> 01:42:29.620
and as great as the crowds might be in Vegas,
it's,

1709
01:42:29.621 --> 01:42:33.220
it's the road crowds that are really insane because Vegas,

1710
01:42:33.221 --> 01:42:37.930
there's a lot of things that come into it from gambling to drinking too.

1711
01:42:38.230 --> 01:42:42.890
You know,
fighting with your wife,
have a,
losing the money.
Yeah,

1712
01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:46.810
it was tense.
But when you come to a concert on the road,

1713
01:42:46.811 --> 01:42:51.070
they're coming just for that.
So I could really drive them.
I want them to leave.

1714
01:42:51.071 --> 01:42:54.820
They're going,
I've never seen anything like that or witnessed that.

1715
01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:59.560
And the crowd is half of it.
You know,
when I do this thing about,
you know,

1716
01:42:59.561 --> 01:43:01.660
that I've been doing for years where,
um,

1717
01:43:02.050 --> 01:43:06.130
where I pick on a guy in the crowd and you know,

1718
01:43:06.131 --> 01:43:09.190
then I turn it around and go,
but look what we've been through,
Eh,

1719
01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:12.700
now me and you were fucking friends,
right?
You know,
fucking best.

1720
01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:15.490
I want to take my glass.
I want to toast you.
I go,
no,

1721
01:43:15.491 --> 01:43:19.690
I want everybody to raise their glasses to this guy.
And the Max goes,

1722
01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:21.730
you should make them get up.

1723
01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:26.980
So I'm in Vegas last time cycle,
forget about raising everybody.

1724
01:43:26.981 --> 01:43:30.790
Get the fuck up,
you know,
get up for this man.

1725
01:43:30.791 --> 01:43:34.990
Some just guys sitting there and I go,
so I want to say to you right now,

1726
01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:40.140
he is to yo and then everybody go suck in my deck.

1727
01:43:40.810 --> 01:43:42.780
Oh,
you know,

1728
01:43:42.910 --> 01:43:46.810
he's just the most ridiculous stuff,
you know?

1729
01:43:46.811 --> 01:43:51.040
And it's just so enjoyable for me because I go,

1730
01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:52.100
they've gotten

1731
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:56.570
<v 4>to leave their life for an hour.
Right.
Cause you know,
I might,</v>

1732
01:43:56.630 --> 01:44:01.280
I might say,
you know,
I hate going up there some nights,
but once I'm out there,

1733
01:44:01.281 --> 01:44:05.300
I just,
that's my freedom to just go nuts.
You know?

1734
01:44:05.301 --> 01:44:07.760
I'll even tell the crowd,
like,
you know why I'm up here right now?

1735
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:11.060
Because sometimes I get into a fight with Eleanor on the stage I go,

1736
01:44:11.061 --> 01:44:12.430
because she just went to Tom.

1737
01:44:12.431 --> 01:44:15.740
My wife would happen here and when I come off this stage,

1738
01:44:15.741 --> 01:44:17.810
they're both going to let me fucking have it.

1739
01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:20.600
So I'm just going to hang out here with you for a little more.

1740
01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:24.200
You know what I mean?
I used to sit in the back of the comedy store,
uh,

1741
01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:26.830
where that,
uh,
back porches,
you know,
there's the,

1742
01:44:26.831 --> 01:44:30.320
there's the steps where Joey Diaz,
who's always just smokes cigarettes,

1743
01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:34.940
the steps where the belly room is.
And we could be back there and a dice,

1744
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:35.783
be on stage,

1745
01:44:36.110 --> 01:44:40.580
your dad would be onstage and all of a sudden we would just hear screaming,

1746
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:42.230
just screaming,

1747
01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:47.410
you fucking dummy you dumb fucking Tommy Dom.

1748
01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:50.430
And we were oh mean dices up mean dice up.

1749
01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:54.290
But we run in the back dice meat in the back and we would sit and watch you

1750
01:44:54.291 --> 01:44:56.910
torture people.
You've had some of the,
my,

1751
01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:01.880
the funniest brutalization of people I've ever,
and there's not even like,

1752
01:45:01.930 --> 01:45:05.120
there's a bunch of people dealing with hecklers that are on,
on the Internet.

1753
01:45:05.150 --> 01:45:09.470
I don't think there's any of you,
any of you have those like comedy store sets.

1754
01:45:09.570 --> 01:45:11.960
Um,
I don't know.
I don't even know.
But uh,

1755
01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:16.550
it can cause so less time we're in Vegas.
Um,
you know,

1756
01:45:16.551 --> 01:45:19.580
obviously Max is single and he's out there looking for girls.

1757
01:45:19.970 --> 01:45:23.920
So can we tell him?
Uh,
sure.
Yeah.

1758
01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:28.260
Well,
I'll start it.
You could finish it.
So this is,

1759
01:45:28.290 --> 01:45:31.910
but I just want to preface this by saying the story I told last time,

1760
01:45:31.911 --> 01:45:36.500
that Alyssa,
the thing,
now this story blows that story away.

1761
01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:39.230
Okay.
That's how you should possibly,
you learn well from your father.

1762
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:43.190
It's so much harder now.
Strong and then build up.
Well,
well this is the thing.

1763
01:45:43.490 --> 01:45:47.750
So there's this girl in the front and she's a 10,
you know,
and she's alone.

1764
01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:53.090
A blind girl just,
you know,
10 from head to toe,
you know,

1765
01:45:53.091 --> 01:45:56.420
with the big tits are nice,
big fat.
It's the right package.

1766
01:45:56.870 --> 01:46:00.410
So I'm talking to her,
you know about what she does.

1767
01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:04.730
She's a Dominatrix,
uh,
the way she put it.

1768
01:46:04.731 --> 01:46:09.260
She said she's in the fetish industry.
She goes,
I'm in the fetish world,
you know,

1769
01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:14.420
and uh,
you know,
I go,
how all of these,
she's only 21 years old,
you know,

1770
01:46:14.710 --> 01:46:19.430
and uh,
you know,
so I go 21.
I go,
you're like young guys,
you know,

1771
01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:22.550
she's going,
yes.
So,
so now I'm mad at the show.

1772
01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:26.180
Cause now it's all about getting Max hooked up and gone.
Max.

1773
01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:30.050
I think I got one for you here.
Okay,
so the next thing you know,

1774
01:46:30.051 --> 01:46:34.010
here comes Max with the girl after the show backstage to get the picture.

1775
01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:37.550
What would ha I'm some off the stage when he's talking to her.

1776
01:46:37.551 --> 01:46:41.150
I don't know what she looks like.
All I know is he's going,
you know,
I have a son,

1777
01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:44.810
you should meet him.
I didn't say I have a son.
I go,
he was up here,
you know,

1778
01:46:44.811 --> 01:46:47.390
he was up here,
you know,
a half hour ago,
whatever.
So I'm like,

1779
01:46:47.391 --> 01:46:49.710
I gotta meet this girl,
but I don't know what looks like.

1780
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:54.060
<v 3>So I run out,
hang out near the tee shirt rack and you know,</v>

1781
01:46:54.090 --> 01:46:58.190
meet this girl when everyone comes out.
And um,
so I see this,

1782
01:46:58.350 --> 01:47:01.920
she's literally the last person out of the place because she was right in the

1783
01:47:01.921 --> 01:47:05.370
front row.
Yeah,
she went to the bathroom or something.
She's the last person,

1784
01:47:05.850 --> 01:47:10.770
Eleanor Eleanor.
She brings a,
the girl out to me and I'm like,
Hey,

1785
01:47:10.771 --> 01:47:14.910
what's up?
Yeah.
You know,
I'm like,
you remember I was on,
he was talking about me.

1786
01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:20.280
So
I'm like,
all right,
you know,
you want to get a drink or whatever,

1787
01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:23.730
you should write cards.
So at first it was,
first it was,

1788
01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:28.050
I want to get a picture so he comes back.
But what's funny is,
you know,

1789
01:47:28.051 --> 01:47:31.390
you got to tell Joe what you tell people that want to meet me.
You know,

1790
01:47:31.410 --> 01:47:34.030
cause he's always out there after the show with my wife and Eleanor.

1791
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:38.000
You know how you tell them like he's not like you're not great.
So,

1792
01:47:38.010 --> 01:47:41.770
but how you kind of have to let people know before it's,
I don't like,

1793
01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:46.040
I don't like meeting people.
No,
I don't.
I'm not a,
I'm not.
No.

1794
01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:50.190
And the reason is because a lot of these guys or come back stage and not try to

1795
01:47:50.191 --> 01:47:54.980
put me like in a headlock and I get physical about it.
You know,

1796
01:47:55.270 --> 01:48:00.030
I'm not going to lie to you and it's not about being tough for anything.
Oh yeah.

1797
01:48:00.031 --> 01:48:02.790
It was this one guy,
this was a couple months ago.

1798
01:48:03.330 --> 01:48:06.660
I thought I was going to break his own when he did that because I just react.

1799
01:48:06.990 --> 01:48:10.500
I don't like to say take your hands off me.
I react to it,
you know?

1800
01:48:10.501 --> 01:48:12.780
And a lot of these guys that are a lot bigger than me,
right.

1801
01:48:12.810 --> 01:48:15.450
But when I'm in that frame of mind,
you don't see it.
It's like,

1802
01:48:15.451 --> 01:48:19.110
don't fucking put your hands on me cause I'll break your shoulder.
You know?

1803
01:48:19.290 --> 01:48:23.550
So he knows not to bring people back.
No papers.

1804
01:48:23.551 --> 01:48:28.140
I hate people,
no people.
You know,
99% of people,
we just tell them that,
you know,

1805
01:48:28.710 --> 01:48:33.660
but he's,
no,
he left.
But they ask him like,
why can't I meet him?

1806
01:48:33.661 --> 01:48:35.100
Right.
Am I just can't,
you know,

1807
01:48:35.101 --> 01:48:38.130
take you back there because he's just not great socially.

1808
01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:41.310
I tried to let them know like,

1809
01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:44.220
you're not going to get the experience that you want.

1810
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:48.270
Like it's awesome to watch the show.
But if you meet him,

1811
01:48:48.271 --> 01:48:49.890
you're probably going to,
I don't know,
you're not going to be.

1812
01:48:49.891 --> 01:48:52.560
So my favorite things you did,
I don't know if you want to talk about this,

1813
01:48:52.561 --> 01:48:55.590
but one of my favorite things you did is you started taking less and less shirts

1814
01:48:55.591 --> 01:48:59.520
with you when you would go to shows.
Oh yeah,
I heard about this.
What do you mean?

1815
01:48:59.550 --> 01:49:02.710
Well,
you shirts are the ones we sell.
Oh,

1816
01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:06.060
that was last time we went to auctions.

1817
01:49:06.450 --> 01:49:10.590
What I decided is what do I get to bring a hundred shirts when I could bring 10

1818
01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:14.400
you know,
and just have,
Mike Black was the opener back then.

1819
01:49:14.401 --> 01:49:18.960
And my kids were with me on the road.
So Mike Black was the barker,

1820
01:49:19.410 --> 01:49:23.250
the auctioneer,
you know.
And we would,
you know,
sell the shirts.

1821
01:49:23.251 --> 01:49:27.920
He would start like at $150 you know,
and you know,

1822
01:49:28.110 --> 01:49:33.030
and we were selling shirts for like between anywhere from one 50 to $500 a
shirt,

1823
01:49:33.570 --> 01:49:35.160
you know,
and you know,
you know,

1824
01:49:35.190 --> 01:49:38.640
and of course with dad I would take a picture and sign the show,
whatever.

1825
01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:44.490
But what was funny is my son Dylan at the time was 12 and he's taken the money,

1826
01:49:44.910 --> 01:49:48.310
you know,
and making the change with Max who was a

1827
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:50.080
<v 2>15,
you know?</v>

1828
01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:54.580
And like that was my crew like flack and these two little kids.

1829
01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:01.120
So from the time you were like 11,
you were watching them do standup?

1830
01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:02.950
I wouldn't really,
uh,
okay.

1831
01:50:02.951 --> 01:50:06.880
Well the first time I ever really saw my dad do standup was in 2000 when I was

1832
01:50:06.881 --> 01:50:11.460
10 because my dad went back to Madison Square Garden.
What did,
this is an inch.

1833
01:50:11.890 --> 01:50:14.380
I got to tell you this story.
I thought there's a lot of stuff.

1834
01:50:14.410 --> 01:50:19.290
There's a lot of good stories.
Is there an ending on this?
Alright.
Alright.

1835
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:24.280
So,
um,
that's a problem and a lot of shows,
right?

1836
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:26.230
You worry about running out of time.
Well,

1837
01:50:26.231 --> 01:50:30.850
I also want to keep it interesting for you.
This is very interesting.
So,

1838
01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:35.620
you know,
since my kids were born,
I always thought about like,

1839
01:50:35.650 --> 01:50:40.450
how do I explain what would I do as their father?

1840
01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:43.840
You know?
And plus they can't really see it.
Right.
You know.

1841
01:50:43.841 --> 01:50:46.120
So from an early age,

1842
01:50:46.121 --> 01:50:50.500
like I groom them into the business,
like understanding,

1843
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:53.530
you know,
what I do and sort of how big it was,

1844
01:50:53.531 --> 01:50:57.880
but it's not that big of a deal to me because I'm daddy.
You know what I mean?

1845
01:50:57.881 --> 01:50:58.780
When they were kids,

1846
01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:04.200
so now max was 10 and Dylan was six and at that time,

1847
01:51:05.141 --> 01:51:09.430
this was the a 2000 and I had nothing going on.

1848
01:51:09.431 --> 01:51:12.550
I didn't have any TV shows or specials.

1849
01:51:14.170 --> 01:51:17.260
So I decided,

1850
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:22.060
I started doing a opie and Anthony W on,
uh,

1851
01:51:22.061 --> 01:51:26.470
in the afternoons.
And at that time I was in a war with Howard Stern.

1852
01:51:26.471 --> 01:51:30.730
We weren't talking and they were the same.
They were the same network,

1853
01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:33.220
you know,
so I didn't give a fuck.

1854
01:51:33.221 --> 01:51:37.090
I would go on their show and they were pretty new at it.

1855
01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:41.890
And the audience started building pretty rapidly between them and May.

1856
01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:46.300
And I would call in three days a week,
or if I was in New York,
I'd go in.

1857
01:51:46.570 --> 01:51:48.340
And that was always drama.

1858
01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:53.500
I had like this huge fucking thing happened with Jay Moore that he was calling

1859
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:55.800
to.
Yeah.
But,
but I,

1860
01:51:55.810 --> 01:51:59.270
I don't want to go fucking single comment that hasn't had a problem with that.

1861
01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:03.490
Not saying it was a simple thing,
what happened?
Don't make me go into that.

1862
01:52:03.491 --> 01:52:06.400
But it was a simple thing that he could have said.
He was sorry,

1863
01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:07.480
I haven't had a problem with it,

1864
01:52:07.481 --> 01:52:12.200
but what he wanted to be a tough guy over the air.
And I was in La Really,

1865
01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:14.980
you know,
and he goes,
hey dice,
I'm not afraid of you.

1866
01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:18.730
What happened is he went like on Letterman and did like a very close thing of

1867
01:52:18.731 --> 01:52:23.380
Pachino to mine.
So when we were on the air,
I said,
you know,
Jay,
I go,

1868
01:52:23.381 --> 01:52:27.970
you did my pachino thing on Letterman.
And he started in rather than go,
oh,
well,

1869
01:52:27.971 --> 01:52:32.200
you know,
it was like,
no,
it wasn't him.
It was Conan.
And I said,
well,

1870
01:52:32.201 --> 01:52:35.950
that's my thing.
You know what I mean?
It's my bit,
and,

1871
01:52:36.610 --> 01:52:40.120
and he got,
I forgot how it got out of control,

1872
01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:43.960
but then he got into like the tug,
you know,
I'm from Jersey,
you know,

1873
01:52:43.961 --> 01:52:46.960
I'm not afraid of you.
I go,
okay.
We tended a little,

1874
01:52:46.970 --> 01:52:48.620
little bit of Jay more impression.

1875
01:52:48.621 --> 01:52:52.040
You've got a little bit of a j more impression.
Do I?
When I do it was,

1876
01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:56.270
it was a huge fight because,
hey,
what'd he say to you?

1877
01:52:56.630 --> 01:52:59.390
Well now I'm thinking about it,
but he goes,
well,
I'm not afraid of you.
You know,

1878
01:52:59.391 --> 01:53:03.950
I'm from Jersey.
And I go,
look Jay,
it's not about that.

1879
01:53:03.951 --> 01:53:08.420
It's about being tough and I'm really fucking tough.
Okay.
I go,

1880
01:53:08.421 --> 01:53:12.140
there aren't too many guys that scare me.
No,
but from,

1881
01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:14.150
but you got to understand,
you know,

1882
01:53:14.151 --> 01:53:16.850
I was putting a hospital a bunch of times when I was a kid.

1883
01:53:16.851 --> 01:53:19.910
I've had my nose busted,
my head split open,

1884
01:53:19.911 --> 01:53:24.050
my face split up and you know,
so I know what it is to lose.

1885
01:53:24.290 --> 01:53:26.720
Like when you lost your first fight,

1886
01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:29.930
you weren't afraid to fight again cause you know what it is to get hit right.

1887
01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:30.561
You know what I mean?

1888
01:53:30.561 --> 01:53:35.561
So the last person on earth that's going to frighten me is a guy with a beige

1889
01:53:35.691 --> 01:53:40.250
sweater and his sleeves rolled up.
Jay Moore.
It doesn't scare me at all.

1890
01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:43.400
But if you're going to tell me in front of millions of people,

1891
01:53:43.401 --> 01:53:46.040
you're not afraid of me.
Well now you got a problem,

1892
01:53:46.041 --> 01:53:50.090
you're not going to be able to fucking handle.
So I told them over the year,

1893
01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:54.380
I can remember you telling me this because now when you get back to La,

1894
01:53:54.620 --> 01:53:58.820
you better come to find me at the comedy store because if I got to come and look

1895
01:53:58.821 --> 01:54:03.110
for you,
it's going to be even fucking worse.
I'm warning you.

1896
01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:06.500
So what happens is after I get off the air,

1897
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:11.000
a Ralphie may calls me because he had my phone number and he goes,
you know,

1898
01:54:11.001 --> 01:54:14.390
Jay was just fucking around.
Go,
you're not involved in this.

1899
01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:18.620
I got the guy opened his mouth.
He in fucking apologized to me.
I go,

1900
01:54:18.621 --> 01:54:22.730
and now you know he's going to have a problem.
If he don't come look for me,

1901
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:26.870
I'll look for him.
It's that simple that his wife even called me.

1902
01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:31.700
They all of a sudden I get a call from a detective.
I thought it was a joke.

1903
01:54:31.701 --> 01:54:36.600
It was at night.
Is this Andrew Clay?
Just Annette?
And I go,
yeah.
He goes,
well,
uh,

1904
01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:40.040
I'm actually a fan.
He goes,
I can't believe I'm calling you,

1905
01:54:40.041 --> 01:54:44.780
but we had a complaint this,
uh,
and he went to the police station,

1906
01:54:44.781 --> 01:54:48.340
like what?
His wife at the time.
And the cop was even telling me,
I,

1907
01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:53.360
it felt more like a domestic dispute and anything else.
And I said,

1908
01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:57.230
we're having a radio fight.
We were arguing on,

1909
01:54:57.350 --> 01:55:02.350
on the opiate and Anthony and we wound up making up whatever,

1910
01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:06.500
wait a minute,
wait and wait and wait and wait.
He wears the fucking police.

1911
01:55:06.501 --> 01:55:10.010
In fact,
like I come basic dispute.
Yeah.

1912
01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:13.430
That was between him and his wife.
I don't,
you know,
well,
what happened?

1913
01:55:13.431 --> 01:55:17.660
He made like a jewel reference to me and that's when I snapped out,

1914
01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:22.670
you know,
uh,
on the,
uh,
on the radio and even the New York Post wrote it.

1915
01:55:22.670 --> 01:55:27.000
It was one of the only times I got protected,
you know,
but you know,

1916
01:55:27.380 --> 01:55:32.210
they wrote up what he,
he said that was very wrong.
And I'm a little Larry.

1917
01:55:32.211 --> 01:55:36.810
This is the fucking news.
Oh,
Jay Morrison,
a Jew joke.
When you put your,

1918
01:55:36.811 --> 01:55:39.820
but you're getting,
you're getting me off.
What happened with the garden?

1919
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:43.920
What happened?
It's a beautiful story,
but at that time know I was doing,

1920
01:55:43.921 --> 01:55:47.190
I was back to clubs,
you know my agents do that.

1921
01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:52.550
So I decided that instead of telling my kids about my history,

1922
01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:55.530
I want to show them one,

1923
01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:59.160
I want to do an arena that I knew there were young,

1924
01:55:59.161 --> 01:56:02.400
but at least they would have that picture in their heads,

1925
01:56:02.401 --> 01:56:04.440
something in years to come.

1926
01:56:04.441 --> 01:56:08.040
That's how I really looked at it would click in their minds that they didn't

1927
01:56:08.041 --> 01:56:11.760
just hear about their father.
They got to see it,
you know,

1928
01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:16.230
in that big of a place.
So I decided to do an album.

1929
01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:20.640
I put the album out the first day it's out.
My agent calls me up and he goes,

1930
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:25.620
what do you think the move is?
And I go,
I say,
you should book the garden.

1931
01:56:26.370 --> 01:56:30.000
And he goes,
book the garden.
He goes,
last time you did Westbury,

1932
01:56:30.001 --> 01:56:33.150
you did half a house.
Now explain to the people listening.

1933
01:56:33.151 --> 01:56:37.530
The different Westbury sold out is about 3000 seats.

1934
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:40.350
So if I did half a house,
1500 seats,

1935
01:56:40.890 --> 01:56:45.090
so why would I be thinking I could be at Madison Square Garden now?

1936
01:56:45.450 --> 01:56:49.110
You know what I mean?
Cause I hadn't done arenas in a,
in a bunch of years.

1937
01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:54.480
So I go,
I'm telling you,
Dennis,
I've been doing this,
this radio show,
you know,

1938
01:56:54.481 --> 01:56:57.150
in New York,
opie and Anthony.
He goes,

1939
01:56:57.270 --> 01:57:01.680
so based off a radio show you're doing,
you think you're selling the garden?

1940
01:57:02.130 --> 01:57:04.770
He goes,
why don't we do the beacon theater?
I go,

1941
01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:09.270
I'll solve the beacon in 20 minutes,
which the beacons like 3,500 seats.

1942
01:57:09.810 --> 01:57:11.670
He goes,
well,
if you sell it in 20 minutes,

1943
01:57:11.671 --> 01:57:13.950
we could always move it to the garden because there's no way.

1944
01:57:14.130 --> 01:57:16.380
He didn't think any way possible.

1945
01:57:16.710 --> 01:57:20.130
You know that I'm going to sell the beacon in 20 minutes.
Bottom line,

1946
01:57:20.131 --> 01:57:23.820
I'm telling you the story short,
I saw it a beacon out in 35 minutes.

1947
01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:27.900
So my agent calls me up and he goes,
I don't get it.

1948
01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:32.940
But obviously there's something,
you know and,
and I don't.
So Ron Delzner,

1949
01:57:32.941 --> 01:57:36.030
who did my first arena with me,
he's a very famous promoter.

1950
01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:39.420
He works under the umbrella now have a live nation.

1951
01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:42.990
He said the same thing to my agent.
He goes,

1952
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:45.360
obviously dice know something we don't.

1953
01:57:45.890 --> 01:57:49.740
So they per 10,000 seats on sale at the garden.
Okay.

1954
01:57:49.741 --> 01:57:54.510
The first day we do 7,000 seats,
which if I didn't have to do the beacon,

1955
01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:57.930
the beacon was on the 20th of October,

1956
01:57:57.930 --> 01:58:01.620
2000 and the garden was now going to be on the 26th not even a week later.

1957
01:58:01.770 --> 01:58:02.840
Holy Shy.

1958
01:58:02.841 --> 01:58:07.841
So 7,000 seats and now the ticket sales slow down because the subway series was

1959
01:58:09.421 --> 01:58:13.680
announced,
the Yankees and the mets.
So ticket sales slow down.

1960
01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:18.270
But the bottom line of what happened is the day of the garden,

1961
01:58:18.271 --> 01:58:21.180
I get a call.
The reason I even stopped doing arenas,

1962
01:58:21.181 --> 01:58:25.440
I would get claustrophobic from the whole thing being sold and people around me,

1963
01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:26.940
so I couldn't take anymore.

1964
01:58:27.330 --> 01:58:31.680
So I get a call from my agent knowing if delzner could open up the back,

1965
01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:37.170
which was incredible because it was going to be the last night of the world

1966
01:58:37.171 --> 01:58:37.621
series,

1967
01:58:37.621 --> 01:58:42.621
the Yankees playing the mets and we did 13,000 people at the garden that night.

1968
01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:47.410
Max was allowed to watch as much of the show as he,

1969
01:58:47.860 --> 01:58:51.460
he knew when I would start getting too filthy leave,

1970
01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:55.960
leave that part of the arena and then come back and when it's not that bad.

1971
01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:59.830
You know what I mean?
You know cause its 11 Max,

1972
01:58:59.890 --> 01:59:01.310
I was like 10 he was 10 years old.

1973
01:59:01.311 --> 01:59:05.020
What was the feeling that you had when you watched your dad go up there in front

1974
01:59:05.021 --> 01:59:07.630
of 13,000 screaming animals?

1975
01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:12.370
What was that like when you realized the of,
I mean what was the realization?

1976
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:15.010
<v 0>Well,
I guess the way I thought about it at that time,</v>

1977
01:59:16.810 --> 01:59:21.810
I just thought it was really cool and I was just 10 years old and the language

1978
01:59:21.881 --> 01:59:26.620
didn't really faze me because even at that age I knew it was just a joke because

1979
01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:31.060
my dad was never like that with me when he was offstage.
I just knew all right,

1980
01:59:31.061 --> 01:59:35.320
when my dad goes on stage,
he's like that when he comes off,
he's somewhat normal,

1981
01:59:35.410 --> 01:59:38.290
you know?
Yeah.
So I'm just,

1982
01:59:38.370 --> 01:59:42.220
as I just saw it as a 10 year old kid just thinking,
whoa,

1983
01:59:42.221 --> 01:59:45.820
that's just so cool that my dad is doing that and that there's all these people

1984
01:59:45.821 --> 01:59:48.090
here and I wasn't thinking in terms of what,

1985
01:59:48.091 --> 01:59:51.010
what this means to stand up and what my dad has done.

1986
01:59:51.011 --> 01:59:53.800
And I didn't have that mindset at the time.
I just thought it was awesome.

1987
01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:58.950
<v 2>Yeah.
And my whole thing was,
like I told you,
I always teach my kids by example.</v>

1988
01:59:59.370 --> 02:00:03.780
I wanted to show them that with hard work and with belief,

1989
02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:08.100
and with that drive that that that's built into you,

1990
02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:12.270
that you could accomplish anything you want to accomplish.
That's always been,

1991
02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:15.270
you know,
when,
when I do certain things and people talk to me,

1992
02:00:15.271 --> 02:00:18.780
like you made all these millions and then you lost it and went through divorce

1993
02:00:18.781 --> 02:00:22.070
and you gambled and you bought shit.
I go,

1994
02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:25.530
it's never been about money to me.
Like,
oh,
I could always make it.
Yeah,

1995
02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:29.880
making money again now.
But the point is that,
you know,

1996
02:00:29.881 --> 02:00:33.210
it's what you do with your life,
what you could accomplish with your life.

1997
02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:38.100
And I didn't really know starting out what it would become when I made it.

1998
02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:41.640
You know,
you're never prepared for what fame brains,

1999
02:00:42.090 --> 02:00:47.090
but I know like even when I saw rocky one with my father in Brooklyn,

2000
02:00:47.610 --> 02:00:50.790
when I left that theater,
I told my father I was 16 years old.
I said,

2001
02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:54.610
I'm going to do that with my life.
And my father goes,
what?

2002
02:00:54.611 --> 02:00:57.360
You're going to become a boxer,
you know?
And I go,
no,
I'm going to,

2003
02:00:57.420 --> 02:01:02.100
I have that thing in me where I could really accomplish with my own life.

2004
02:01:02.430 --> 02:01:05.770
I'm just not sure how I'm going to go about it yet.
And,

2005
02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:09.240
and that's what it's always been to four for me,

2006
02:01:09.390 --> 02:01:13.320
it's always been like reach your highest potential and what you do,

2007
02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:17.990
give the very best and show people what you got to,

2008
02:01:18.210 --> 02:01:22.500
to offer them.
And I always think of myself and I know my history,
you know,

2009
02:01:22.710 --> 02:01:27.180
and I know you know that,
that,
I mean,
I don't know who the guy,

2010
02:01:27.181 --> 02:01:31.020
I'll come around that tea,
you know,
I did the rose bowl with guns and roses,

2011
02:01:31.410 --> 02:01:33.570
you know,
I did things like that.
You know,

2012
02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:38.840
it takes a certain person in my mind that God puts here at a certain time to do

2013
02:01:40.101 --> 02:01:41.600
these different things.

2014
02:01:41.930 --> 02:01:46.880
And I always felt like I was born when I was born to do exactly what I'm doing

2015
02:01:46.881 --> 02:01:49.280
now and that that's how it is for me.

2016
02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:52.580
And you know where I believe if you believe something like that,

2017
02:01:52.581 --> 02:01:54.080
if you truly believe something like that,

2018
02:01:54.081 --> 02:01:57.360
it's incredibly empowering and it becomes real.
Oh please.
You can become real.

2019
02:01:57.560 --> 02:01:59.960
When I used to come off at the comedy store to win the morning.

2020
02:01:59.961 --> 02:02:03.470
You know when there's four people and you know the s whole Karmic,

2021
02:02:03.471 --> 02:02:07.040
whoever it would be wearing a thin coat,
too good.
I'd look at that guy and go,

2022
02:02:07.190 --> 02:02:10.400
I'm the biggest in the world.
They just don't know it yet.

2023
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:14.660
And this is when I was a struggling comic and that's what comics can handle with

2024
02:02:14.661 --> 02:02:19.370
me.
It was the,
the real part of who I am,
forget about on stage,

2025
02:02:19.371 --> 02:02:23.960
the jokes,
everything was this unbelievable confidence that I was given,

2026
02:02:24.530 --> 02:02:24.980
you know?

2027
02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:29.980
And it's always been inside me like just a complete belief in I could conquer

2028
02:02:30.770 --> 02:02:34.670
whatever I have to conquer.
That's completely different than most comedians.
Yeah.

2029
02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:38.120
Most comics,
if you think of comics years ago,
I mean,
you know,

2030
02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:42.410
I'm the affair or anything,
but you're a nice looking guy.
I'm a nice looking guy.

2031
02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:45.150
My son's Nice,
what I'm saying could comics years ago,

2032
02:02:45.170 --> 02:02:47.690
think of what Buddy Hackett look like that guide him.

2033
02:02:47.691 --> 02:02:50.960
Walk around and look in the mirror and go,
I could bang anything I want.

2034
02:02:51.470 --> 02:02:54.620
You know what I mean?
[inaudible] were goofy looking fucking guys.

2035
02:02:54.650 --> 02:02:57.530
I think it comes to the point where you can't really define comedy.

2036
02:02:57.531 --> 02:02:59.120
It's either comedy or it's not comedy.

2037
02:02:59.121 --> 02:03:02.090
And there's a fucking billion different examples.
There's Mitch Hedberg,

2038
02:03:02.091 --> 02:03:04.340
there's you,
there's,
there's a million different answers.

2039
02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:08.150
And that's why I never understood why comics had no comradery between them

2040
02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:12.350
because everybody's just an individual.
You know,
everybody,
you know,

2041
02:03:12.351 --> 02:03:15.710
there were guys that do prop come and that's why I hate when guys pick on carrot

2042
02:03:15.711 --> 02:03:19.640
topic cause I go guy could own fucking Las Vegas.
Okay.

2043
02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:22.310
He's cooking and he always seems like a nice guy.

2044
02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:26.500
He's one of the nicest guys you'd ever meet.
Carrot top and seems real friendly.

2045
02:03:26.501 --> 02:03:30.100
Yeah.
And I did fine.
I did this fucking roast for,
uh,

2046
02:03:30.150 --> 02:03:34.880
for kiss for Gene Simmons and I'm downstairs waiting to go on and Gene Simmons

2047
02:03:34.881 --> 02:03:38.750
didn't even know I'm going to do the roast.
I came from the front doors and uh,

2048
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:41.870
and a all picking on fucking carrot top.

2049
02:03:41.871 --> 02:03:46.370
And I came up to annihilate these fucking guys for doing that,
you know?

2050
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:50.840
And when I got the carrot top,
he thought I was going to destroy him,
you know?

2051
02:03:50.841 --> 02:03:51.674
And I said,

2052
02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:54.740
and your rule is sitting here and you're picking on fucking carrot top.

2053
02:03:55.130 --> 02:03:59.870
And he gave me like 20 calls it,
that is because I was like,
it was,
it was,

2054
02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:04.100
it was the bully effect.
They will bullying this guy.
And I was like,

2055
02:04:04.101 --> 02:04:08.030
I could shred anyone at this,
this fucking guy that hosts the show,

2056
02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:12.890
this ugly motherfucker who is a Ross.
Jeff.
Yeah.

2057
02:04:12.891 --> 02:04:13.724
Jeff Ross.

2058
02:04:15.110 --> 02:04:19.960
This fucking little piece of come that came from his dad's day.
Whoa.
You know?

2059
02:04:20.310 --> 02:04:22.010
Well,
no,
the guy,
the guy introduced,

2060
02:04:22.011 --> 02:04:25.430
remember from the Eighties Andrew dice clay in the mean.
That's what he said.

2061
02:04:25.431 --> 02:04:29.200
That's how I guess now.
Well,
that's what I'm saying.

2062
02:04:29.220 --> 02:04:33.410
It's like did his day.
Who the fuck even knows him?
You know,

2063
02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:38.330
he's just this little fucking roly poly cock sucker,

You know what I mean?

2065
02:04:43.770 --> 02:04:47.490
There's a visual.
Yeah,
well that's what he is in my mind.
Well,
you know,

2066
02:04:47.491 --> 02:04:49.510
Jeff's things,
the roastmaster

2067
02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:51.300
<v 4>as whole human beings.</v>

2068
02:04:53.250 --> 02:04:57.990
There's nothing better than that Brooklyn version of asshole.
He's in Aa,

2069
02:04:57.991 --> 02:05:02.340
so it's an ace or symbols,
a fucking air.

2070
02:05:02.341 --> 02:05:07.341
So you understand I'm not calling him and I'm saying he's got an s whole face.

2071
02:05:08.130 --> 02:05:08.911
Oh,
I see what you're saying.

2072
02:05:08.911 --> 02:05:12.060
So what I'm saying is he's got to face that on a lot of levels.

2073
02:05:12.210 --> 02:05:16.590
Resembles a fucking asshole.
It's always been a nice guy to me.
Oh,

Anybody looking to knock me down.
You know,

2075
02:05:21.211 --> 02:05:23.700
they're getting knocked down when I was fucking where we breathe.

2076
02:05:23.701 --> 02:05:28.670
It's unnecessary.
And uh,
and first of all,
you gotta,
I mean,
Nice Guy,
I guess.

2077
02:05:28.710 --> 02:05:30.930
You know,
I got nothing against him.
He's just,

2078
02:05:30.931 --> 02:05:32.880
you want to open your mouth about me.

2079
02:05:32.881 --> 02:05:35.160
You've got an enemy for life and when you don't want,

2080
02:05:35.250 --> 02:05:40.070
why are you in the meets with opie right now?

2082
02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:50.970

Max was in the studio and they had a problem with this.
Uh,

and we became enemies for a little while,
but we met up.
That's cool.

2088
02:06:08.940 --> 02:06:10.310
They're good guys.
We have a good time.

2089
02:06:10.390 --> 02:06:13.310
<v 4>Max,

She was the last one out of the,</v>

2090
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:15.450
the audience that dominate trick sticks that we are at.

2091
02:06:15.451 --> 02:06:20.451
[inaudible] I talk about anything on then fucking box.

2092
02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:22.730
How did we even get,
that's a weird term.

2093
02:06:22.731 --> 02:06:24.260
Thank God Brian was here to bring this up.

2094
02:06:25.980 --> 02:06:29.800
<v 2>So what happened?
Okay,
so after the,
after the show rather.
Okay.</v>

2095
02:06:29.801 --> 02:06:31.980
So I meet her at the tee shirt stand,

2096
02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:37.360
bring up backstage and this is the kid that tells the young man,

2097
02:06:37.361 --> 02:06:40.390
I should say to tells everybody it's impossible.

2098
02:06:40.570 --> 02:06:42.520
He's not good with people.

2099
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:47.500
But the minute as a girl he had comes Max,
which I loved.

2100
02:06:48.490 --> 02:06:49.930
And my dad was really cool with her,

2101
02:06:49.960 --> 02:06:53.080
super friendly because he knew he knew what I was going for.

2102
02:06:53.081 --> 02:06:57.460
So new to what you know,
be cool.
So they take the picture,

2103
02:06:58.060 --> 02:07:01.810
we get out of there,
go downstairs and then here comes my wife,
you know,

2104
02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:06.790
the Latino wife with Eleanor and I'm going,
Oh,
this is my wife Valerie.

2105
02:07:06.910 --> 02:07:09.140
You know,
we don't want anyone getting into,

2106
02:07:09.170 --> 02:07:12.270
we don't want anybody getting the wrong idea.
Like she's back there for me,

2107
02:07:12.271 --> 02:07:16.810
you know?
Right.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm not going to give every detail.
No,
you don't have.

2108
02:07:16.910 --> 02:07:19.220
So we go downstairs,
have a couple of days.

2109
02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:22.090
We ended up having some more drinks than I really thought we were going to have.

2110
02:07:22.230 --> 02:07:24.790
You have like four piece or whatever.
And um,

2111
02:07:26.290 --> 02:07:31.090
I'm not even sure how to tell basically the next day when he was the greatest

2112
02:07:31.091 --> 02:07:33.250
night of my life.
That's the only way to say it.

2113
02:07:33.251 --> 02:07:36.010
It was single handedly the greatest night

2114
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:37.840
<v 4>of my life.
Any peacock feathers,</v>

2115
02:07:37.841 --> 02:07:42.220
any dominatrix stuff involved or because it's what she does,

2116
02:07:42.250 --> 02:07:47.250
she was just so relaxed and open about anything sexually that it just made me

2117
02:07:47.741 --> 02:07:51.490
completely relaxed and feel completely at ease because it's what she does.

2118
02:07:51.491 --> 02:07:53.950
It's her job.
When she came back stage,

2119
02:07:53.951 --> 02:07:57.680
I had a question her a little because you know,
I still got to look out for him,

2120
02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:00.820
you know,

2121
02:08:00.820 --> 02:08:04.630
so I'm like asking her like what she does and you sent me the text message

2122
02:08:04.631 --> 02:08:09.490
telling me about different things I do smoking fetish.
I go,
what's his smoking?

2123
02:08:09.491 --> 02:08:10.600
She goes,
guys,

2124
02:08:10.601 --> 02:08:14.500
they'll just come in a just smoke cigarettes around them and act tough.
Whoa.

2125
02:08:14.530 --> 02:08:19.140
You know,
crazy shit.
You know?
But you wind up dating this girl.
It was fun.

2126
02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:20.260
When I went down to the bar,

2127
02:08:20.261 --> 02:08:24.280
I got a text from my dad in all capitals because my dad likes to text and all

2128
02:08:24.281 --> 02:08:25.114
capitals.

2129
02:08:26.090 --> 02:08:29.830
<v 3>So it always sounds like how cause I got a problem with my left dies so I don't</v>

2130
02:08:29.831 --> 02:08:33.740
see the phone is good.
And uh,
it was like day

2131
02:08:33.740 --> 02:08:38.600
<v 4>in the hotel.
Don't give her any money and have fun.
Oh,

2132
02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:43.400
Yeah.
Look caps.
Yeah.
Joe,
Joe.
Joe Changes the,
uh,

2133
02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:44.870
the screen size actually.

2134
02:08:44.871 --> 02:08:49.871
So I nearly texts Joe nearly texted to you yesterday that I texted in capital

2135
02:08:50.301 --> 02:08:53.780
letters because of my aunt.
Oh,

No,

That's his,

2136
02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:57.910
that's what I,
uh,
I made the text larger so I can see it.
It's any options,

2137
02:08:57.930 --> 02:09:01.170
you know,
he sounds like he's scaling through the text message.
Oh,
I don't know.

2138
02:09:01.171 --> 02:09:05.030
How do you have an iPhone?
No,
I don't believe in 2012.

2139
02:09:05.031 --> 02:09:07.440
You shouldn't look into one of those.
They exist,
I swear.
Awesome.

2140
02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:11.390
What do you believe in?
You don't believe in Iphone,
but it's really rarely,

2141
02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:14.390
but it's real,
but it's really,
I have two of them.
I just don't believe in him.

2142
02:09:14.391 --> 02:09:16.520
I think it's still much,
they're like the upper cons.

2143
02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:20.780
What is it about a that you don't believe in them too much?

2144
02:09:20.990 --> 02:09:25.970
How much do I need to do with,
you know what I mean?
I Dunno.
For me,
um,
I'm a,

2145
02:09:25.971 --> 02:09:28.430
I'm a technological junkie.

just to sum up the rest of the story real quick for all of the lessons that you

2154
02:09:57.081 --> 02:10:01.060

2157
02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:09.130
you go on the water and you could call it.

2158
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:16.110
<v 3>Yeah.
It's like,
why does it need to go on the ward?

2165
02:10:35.150 --> 02:10:37.550
So does he have like that kind of computer that got everything?

2166
02:10:37.551 --> 02:10:40.830
You could just fucking the ocean man though.
Wow.
He doesn't even have that.

2167
02:10:40.831 --> 02:10:43.340
It doesn't even have,
does you have an iPhone?
I love when people,

2168
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:47.630
when people show you their phone and go,
you can't even get this echo.

2169
02:10:47.631 --> 02:10:51.490
Well how the fuck did you get from NASA?
Who the fuck you,

2170
02:10:52.620 --> 02:10:55.700
but what you can get today,
that's what people do with their,

2171
02:10:55.701 --> 02:10:58.190
with their electronics.
So you can't get well,

2172
02:10:58.191 --> 02:11:00.890
who the fuck you got to know to get this.
Yeah,
exactly.

2173
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:07.550
I'm telling you,
I do a whole thing on it now.
I can't with the technology,

2174
02:11:07.551 --> 02:11:11.240
like you know when you go to parties it's all they talk about,
you know,

2175
02:11:11.241 --> 02:11:13.340
instead of what a party should be.

2176
02:11:13.341 --> 02:11:17.210
Fucking the ugly guy or girl on everybody's jackets.
You know what I mean?

2177
02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:21.770
That's a party.
I remember that you move your jacket out of the pile and go,
yeah,

2178
02:11:21.771 --> 02:11:25.250
come in here.
That was the nice dark room come here,
chubby.

2179
02:11:25.690 --> 02:11:26.990
It was coming pockets.

2180
02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:31.880
First thing I would do when I go to a party years ago when I was like 17,
18,

2181
02:11:32.150 --> 02:11:35.660
you spot the ugly girl in the corner.
Gonnar and if that don't work out,

2182
02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:39.350
she'll still be there.
Nothing like a fat girl.

2183
02:11:39.351 --> 02:11:41.660
I taught the Max all the time.
What else happened?

2184
02:11:41.661 --> 02:11:45.230
Did anything else happen to the dominatrix?
The best way to search?
Actually,

2185
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:48.860
you know what?
You can explain what happened with the,
uh,
with the condoms.
Oh,

2186
02:11:48.861 --> 02:11:52.040
this is a really cool story.
I hope so anyways,

2187
02:11:52.910 --> 02:11:54.230
cause when I think about it's cool,

2188
02:11:54.250 --> 02:11:56.140
<v 0>but let's see how it comes out.
How old are you Max?</v>

2189
02:11:56.230 --> 02:12:01.230
I'm 21 so I didn't have any condoms on me and I figured she would because of

2190
02:12:02.921 --> 02:12:07.570
what?
She knows.
Jesus,
everything's just about to go down.
And this is after,

2191
02:12:07.571 --> 02:12:11.590
you know,
we go to the hotel room,
I play her my rock bands,
music,

2192
02:12:11.591 --> 02:12:16.240
which there's really nothing better to do with a girl then play her your own
bay.

2193
02:12:16.241 --> 02:12:19.960
I don't like an iPod or whatever.
So she's really into the music.

2194
02:12:19.961 --> 02:12:24.580
Everything's about to go down and we don't have any condoms.
So she starts going,

2195
02:12:24.581 --> 02:12:27.460
you know,
I feel everything happens for a reason.

2196
02:12:27.730 --> 02:12:32.080
Maybe we're not supposed to get together.
And I go into a panic because I'm like,

2197
02:12:32.081 --> 02:12:34.590
there's no way we're in the bed.
It has to go down.

2198
02:12:34.630 --> 02:12:38.140
There's no way this is not happening.
She goes to the bathroom,

2199
02:12:38.141 --> 02:12:40.390
I pick up the phone,
call the operator,
I'm like,

2200
02:12:41.170 --> 02:12:45.010
can we get some condoms up to room 52 45 please?

2201
02:12:45.490 --> 02:12:46.840
And they send that liver at condom.

2202
02:12:46.850 --> 02:12:51.250
They send up like this classic bellman like 50 something years old,

2203
02:12:51.251 --> 02:12:55.330
full head of solid gray gives me the condoms.

2204
02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:57.640
I give them the money and uh,

2205
02:12:57.700 --> 02:12:58.800
<v 4>I didn't know they would do that and see,</v>

2206
02:12:58.810 --> 02:13:02.140
I would be the guy running out in the lobby trying to get a towel take from,

2207
02:13:02.260 --> 02:13:05.010
I didn't know.
They didn't know.
He knew if he left the game.

2208
02:13:05.110 --> 02:13:07.240
So that's a strong mood.
Is he strong?

2209
02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:11.470
Read it once in an article that said like Michael Jordan did that once.

2210
02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:15.130
He called down and wanted condoms,
brought up once a week and I was,

2211
02:13:15.250 --> 02:13:18.500
for whatever reason that came into my mind and I'm like,
just call down and ask

2212
02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:21.800
<v 0>from.
And the dude really hooked it up.
It's awesome.
Then this girl,</v>

2213
02:13:21.801 --> 02:13:26.360
she showed me like the sexual light and a,
she still hasn't texted me back so

2214
02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:29.140
<v 4>I really,
I'm looking at is hit it and quit it.
You know,</v>

2215
02:13:30.650 --> 02:13:32.100
you want to want to know that.
That's another

2216
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:36.120
<v 2>thing with guys today.
Like,
um,
I was talking to this,
um,</v>

2217
02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:38.610
this,
this producer,
this guy,

2218
02:13:38.611 --> 02:13:41.190
one of the guys that was on a [inaudible] name name's Rob Weiss.

2219
02:13:41.191 --> 02:13:43.650
He's really funny guy.
And um,

2220
02:13:43.950 --> 02:13:48.060
he was telling me like a story of a girl he was with and you know how they did

2221
02:13:48.061 --> 02:13:52.250
everything and then you know,
like the next day how you would call,
how you doing,

2222
02:13:52.270 --> 02:13:55.590
let's get together again.
And the girl like blew him off in a minute,

2223
02:13:55.591 --> 02:13:58.320
go and I'll call you right back.
And he goes,

2224
02:13:58.530 --> 02:14:02.870
now I'm sitting there like the fucking girls used to do waiting for the call

2225
02:14:02.871 --> 02:14:07.080
back.
That never comes.
You know what I mean?
It's the funniest thing.

2226
02:14:07.081 --> 02:14:12.030
This generation of women,
they could go out,
bang a guy all night and then just,

2227
02:14:12.031 --> 02:14:16.350
you know,
forget about it.
They see that when the birth control pill came along,

2228
02:14:16.351 --> 02:14:18.490
the whole fucking world changed it real.

2229
02:14:18.500 --> 02:14:21.330
Now when the Internet came along it changed again.

2230
02:14:21.930 --> 02:14:25.710
It cheers incense.
Just the acts like a strange thing that I,

2231
02:14:25.711 --> 02:14:28.620
I can't figure out like if you really hit it off with someone,
why not?

2232
02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:31.950
Why not stay in touch or whatever.
But uh,
you know,
I can't figure out,

2233
02:14:31.951 --> 02:14:34.290
you know her mind.
How quick did you come to be honest,

2234
02:14:36.420 --> 02:14:39.420
I'm not going to give the exact amount of time,
but it was,

2235
02:14:39.421 --> 02:14:43.950
it was so much fun and we,
you know what,
you are talking a lot about his music.

2236
02:14:43.951 --> 02:14:44.580
You know,

2237
02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:48.420
they could play one of your songs if they got to that site you could play and

2238
02:14:48.421 --> 02:14:53.340
one of the songs up there
if it tell them what to go to.

2239
02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:57.960
Okay.
Your one last favor and I said it was all my space last time.
No,

2240
02:14:57.961 --> 02:15:01.230
it doesn't matter.
But my space is still the gym.
No,
but,
but the point,

2241
02:15:01.231 --> 02:15:06.000
and they're revamping my space anyway,
but I'm just making a comeback.
Yeah.

2242
02:15:06.001 --> 02:15:07.440
My space is making a comeback.

2243
02:15:08.650 --> 02:15:13.650
If you tell them about my space.com/official la rocks,

2244
02:15:13.771 --> 02:15:17.280
that's where we can find the official La rocs cause there was an la rocks,

2245
02:15:17.281 --> 02:15:20.040
but then play the song until it,
until they set this up for you.

2246
02:15:20.430 --> 02:15:24.240
You got understand when these songs were recorded,
number of,
and Max,

2247
02:15:24.241 --> 02:15:26.940
I don't even know if he was 17 yet.
He's on the drums.

2248
02:15:27.390 --> 02:15:31.710
And Dylan was how old?
13,
14 if I'm,

2249
02:15:32.010 --> 02:15:36.390
Dylan was like 13.
He was 13 years old.
Dylan wrote the music,

2250
02:15:37.390 --> 02:15:41.430
the plays,
the lead guitar,
the bass,

2251
02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:45.840
the lead vocal,
the words.
So people listening to this,

2252
02:15:45.841 --> 02:15:49.800
got to realize this is a 13 year old kid on lead vocal and guitar.

2253
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:55.410
He was only playing guitar about a year and a half.
Wow.
Okay.
And you know,

2254
02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:59.360
it,
it just happened as a fluke because I was going to use a,

2255
02:15:59.370 --> 02:16:02.550
which song we going to play right in court?
John Junkyard junk.
All.
Alright.

2256
02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:05.760
A dumb play.
Uh,
when,
when we went into the studio,

2257
02:16:05.761 --> 02:16:09.750
they would just going to lay the music down for my album that I still never put

2258
02:16:09.751 --> 02:16:14.220
out.
And Dylan asks,
can I sing it?
This is the night before.
And I go,

2259
02:16:14.221 --> 02:16:18.600
well yeah,
sure you could sing.
And I,
I didn't know you could sing.
You know,
I go,

2260
02:16:18.601 --> 02:16:22.170
but you know,
I would never put anything on an album that would embarrass you.

2261
02:16:22.171 --> 02:16:26.700
So if it doesn't sound right,
we'll just use the music.
So they go in,

2262
02:16:26.730 --> 02:16:29.590
they laid the track,
the music track down in one take.

2263
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:34.270
<v 3>Then Dylan did the baseline and one take,
and then the engineer goes,
you know,</v>

2264
02:16:34.271 --> 02:16:36.730
if you want,
cause he's a little kid.
He goes,

2265
02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:40.090
you could come back tomorrow and do the vocal.
And he goes,

2266
02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:44.710
rock and roll happens at night.
Okay,
so now,

2267
02:16:45.010 --> 02:16:48.640
now with that being said,
this is,
you know,
a couple of years ago,

2268
02:16:48.850 --> 02:16:52.840
so do the one that's junk yard.
So 13 and how old at this time,

2269
02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:55.900
don't say 13.
I'm 17,
13 and 17

2270
02:17:20.830 --> 02:17:22.780
<v 7>rusted and</v>

2271
02:17:26.540 --> 02:17:29.650
backing from the,

2272
02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.920
when
say

2273
02:17:37.540 --> 02:17:40.600
for 13 and 17,
this is fucking unbelievable.

2274
02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:09.633
Yeah.

2275
02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:13.780
<v 4>You guys,
Alison chains fans.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2276
02:18:14.190 --> 02:18:17.290
It sounds it's fucking good,
dude.
Yeah,
that's right.
Great.

2277
02:18:18.030 --> 02:18:19.730
That's it.
Okay.

2278
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:22.663
<v 7>Gets better.</v>

2279
02:18:27.220 --> 02:18:28.750
And the smile

2280
02:18:38.750 --> 02:18:40.660
big.
Fucking Joe.

2281
02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:09.650
No.
Wow.

2282
02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:37.040
<v 4>Great drumming,
man.
You know what else I like?</v>

2283
02:19:37.041 --> 02:19:41.740
It's not some boy band bullshit.
This is,
this is adult rock.
Yeah.

2284
02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:45.560
They want,
they want it to be like a to ban guns and roses.

2285
02:19:47.450 --> 02:19:49.890
Well,
you got talented kids,
man.
That's got to feel it.
Great.

2286
02:19:50.170 --> 02:19:51.900
<v 0>Yeah.
How many songs you've got up there?</v>

2287
02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:55.950
I think there's only like three or four on the actual,
what's,
what's on there?

2288
02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.620
Where,
where are they going to?
If people at home want to listen to this,

2289
02:19:58.680 --> 02:20:03.680
if you go to myspace.com/official la raw official la rocks,

2290
02:20:03.870 --> 02:20:07.390
what does songs,
what do you dedicate your time to more stand up for that?
Well,

2291
02:20:07.410 --> 02:20:09.310
I've really been doing the,
uh,

2292
02:20:09.390 --> 02:20:13.110
doing the standup mostly because the band actually broke up.

2293
02:20:13.140 --> 02:20:16.680
You and your brother broke up?
Well,
well,
what happened was real short,

2294
02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:19.140
when these record companies came at them,

2295
02:20:19.740 --> 02:20:24.690
Dylan got a little overwhelmed and I couldn't blame him and I would actually

2296
02:20:24.691 --> 02:20:28.310
tell them,
I go,
look,
I'm not Joe Jackson.
I'm not going to force you into stardom.

2297
02:20:28.750 --> 02:20:30.300
You know what I mean?
Good for you.
But,

2298
02:20:30.301 --> 02:20:34.200
but now he's like back into it and they were actually going to open my special

2299
02:20:34.201 --> 02:20:37.610
for me.
That's fucking awesome.
That's gotta be so cool,
man.

2300
02:20:37.630 --> 02:20:39.390
Have you kids doing something like that,
you know?

2301
02:20:39.391 --> 02:20:43.110
And the reality is regular life sucks.

2302
02:20:43.290 --> 02:20:46.680
Having a regular job,
being some fucking dude working in an office.

2303
02:20:46.681 --> 02:20:50.940
When you see your dad live in the way he lives and doing what he wants to do and

2304
02:20:50.941 --> 02:20:54.930
being free,
it's really not that many other paths for you.
You grew up with it.

2305
02:20:54.931 --> 02:20:55.651
You know,
you see it.

2306
02:20:55.651 --> 02:20:58.230
It's the greatest way to make a living in the history of the fucking universe.

2307
02:20:58.440 --> 02:21:01.650
Creating your own shit.
Put it out there.
People love it.
They come to see you,

2308
02:21:01.651 --> 02:21:04.890
they give you money and you're fucking have a great time and you live this life

2309
02:21:04.891 --> 02:21:07.920
like the big fat,
stupid party that it's supposed to be.
Well,
you know,

2310
02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:13.050
that sounds good.
You know,
you can do it.
You know,
he,

2311
02:21:13.060 --> 02:21:17.250
he already realizes what it assaults people could be.
So he goes,

2312
02:21:17.550 --> 02:21:22.550
I can't wait to become famous so I could just get a house and put a big wall

2313
02:21:24.540 --> 02:21:29.040
between me and the rest of the world.
You know,
like when he'll come home,

2314
02:21:29.041 --> 02:21:31.620
like from the comedy store at night,
you know,

2315
02:21:31.621 --> 02:21:35.700
because of everything he sees that they're,
you know,
it's just the funniest way.

2316
02:21:35.701 --> 02:21:40.200
Now he puts it to me.
It's weird watching kids,
uh,
like Max being raised.

2317
02:21:40.201 --> 02:21:43.860
He's had the internet his whole life too.
There are different kids today,

2318
02:21:44.040 --> 02:21:47.310
21 year old.
You are much more mature,

2319
02:21:47.311 --> 02:21:50.910
advanced aware than I was when I was 21 when I was 21.

2320
02:21:50.911 --> 02:21:53.760
I was a fucking idiot when I first started doing stand up.

2321
02:21:53.820 --> 02:21:57.190
I didn't know what the fuck was going on in the world.
I didn't care.
You know,

2322
02:21:57.210 --> 02:21:58.590
one of the reasons why I like,

2323
02:21:58.591 --> 02:22:01.650
I like dirty jokes cause that's the only shit that I thought it was actually

2324
02:22:01.651 --> 02:22:04.860
funny.
You know,
that's all I cared about and it was 21 years old.
What did,

2325
02:22:04.861 --> 02:22:06.990
what did I care about?
Cared about?
Like fucking,
you know,

2326
02:22:06.991 --> 02:22:10.040
that's what I wanted to do on again,
it's a dirty word and fuck it is a drug.

2327
02:22:10.100 --> 02:22:10.933
That's why,

2328
02:22:11.940 --> 02:22:15.990
that's why I initially started off like trying to be like a really clean comic

2329
02:22:15.991 --> 02:22:18.660
and it just has not really gotten that way because it's,

2330
02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:22.080
it's really hard to just be one to be clean.

2331
02:22:22.140 --> 02:22:24.720
Now Jerry Seinfeld as a,

2332
02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:27.840
I admire him as a man who crafts jokes.

2333
02:22:27.841 --> 02:22:31.050
If you go and you listen and he's phenomenal.
Yeah,
he's a craftsman.

2334
02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:34.200
I mean he knows how it's pacing his delivery.

2335
02:22:34.201 --> 02:22:39.190
His right toe is the best clean comic though my dad always uses a Seinfeld is

2336
02:22:39.191 --> 02:22:40.770
ass again is another great example.

2337
02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:44.070
Gaffigan is a Goddamn craftsman and he likes doing that kind of comedy.

2338
02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:47.670
You hang out and talk to the guy.
That's how he talks.
But to me,

2339
02:22:47.710 --> 02:22:51.510
you know what's always been the funniest to me is people just get fucking crazy.

2340
02:22:51.511 --> 02:22:55.170
I don't,
I don't want to go see,
I love comedy period.
I mean,

2341
02:22:55.171 --> 02:22:56.970
I'll go to see a clean comic if he's really funny.

2342
02:22:56.971 --> 02:22:59.460
I would love to go see Gaffigan or something like that.
But if I,

2343
02:22:59.910 --> 02:23:04.620
if I had my choice,
I see some people live in it.
We're in a dirty world.

2344
02:23:04.621 --> 02:23:07.560
We live in reality with a lot of dirty things going on.

2345
02:23:07.561 --> 02:23:10.410
So if you're on stage as a comic,
you know,

2346
02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:14.670
our whole job is commentary on the world,
you know?
Yeah.

2347
02:23:14.671 --> 02:23:17.580
And you need to address every unturned rock and it's,

2348
02:23:17.581 --> 02:23:21.150
and it's like to be a new comic in the year 2012 you know,

2349
02:23:21.151 --> 02:23:24.180
Seinfeld even came up in the early eighties you know,

2350
02:23:24.181 --> 02:23:28.170
it seems like it might've been a little easier to be green or at that time Queen

2351
02:23:28.170 --> 02:23:30.150
Shit's done,
son.
The Internet came along once goats,

2352
02:23:30.151 --> 02:23:33.750
he was around when I saw people calling apart their asshole with a wedding ring

2353
02:23:33.751 --> 02:23:37.020
in your hand.
You ever see that picture?
Of course you have.
How about tough girl.

2354
02:23:37.021 --> 02:23:39.610
You ever see top girl,
the girl when the ass up in the air,

2355
02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:43.200
a fountain spray of diarrhea is splattering on her face.

2356
02:23:43.201 --> 02:23:46.360
She has a cheesecloth over it.
I can't.
I can't look at those things.

2357
02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:51.300
It's incredible.
One of it.
Have you seen the MR hands now?
Haven't seen a lot.

2358
02:23:51.301 --> 02:23:53.390
I've heard of a lot of [inaudible].
Mr Hands,

2359
02:23:53.410 --> 02:23:57.900
the guy that gets fucked to death by a horse,
he was a guy.
They started,

2360
02:23:57.901 --> 02:24:00.090
they changed the law in Washington state about this guy.

2361
02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:03.660
They made a documentary about it called zoo.
Apparently for the longest tie,

2362
02:24:03.661 --> 02:24:04.530
Washington state,

2363
02:24:04.531 --> 02:24:08.820
it was legal to have sex with animals so people would fly to Washington state

2364
02:24:08.821 --> 02:24:12.080
and move in and make farms together and have sex and make videos.
Oh,

2365
02:24:12.450 --> 02:24:14.940
ridiculous shit.
Did see that video?
It's insane.

2366
02:24:15.450 --> 02:24:19.030
None of this was around when and when your dad was around when he was young and

2367
02:24:19.031 --> 02:24:21.960
this was around when I was your age.
You were growing up in a,

2368
02:24:21.970 --> 02:24:23.880
in an area of exposure,

2369
02:24:23.881 --> 02:24:27.720
a different world than anything that I saw when I was 21 legal.

2370
02:24:27.730 --> 02:24:30.750
It's going to be interesting with animals.
It's not any more.
They changed it.

2371
02:24:30.990 --> 02:24:34.080
It was just an old law that,
you know,
it was on the books forever.
And so they,

2372
02:24:34.081 --> 02:24:36.670
they were,
they were found this loophole.
It's actually like a,
uh,

2373
02:24:36.690 --> 02:24:41.370
clinical psychological disorder.
It's called zoophilia or Washington.

2374
02:24:41.371 --> 02:24:44.970
Like if you ask somebody like you seeing anybody,
yeah,
I'm living with a ferret.

2375
02:24:44.971 --> 02:24:49.650
Right.
They were into horses.
They weren't a things get fucking them.

2376
02:24:50.250 --> 02:24:54.540
The guy had a perforated colon bled out and they filthy is,

2377
02:24:54.541 --> 02:24:58.410
I get on stage and I get filthy,
you know,
uh,

2378
02:24:58.770 --> 02:25:01.620
like that's the kind of stuff I can't even look at.
Do you,

2379
02:25:01.860 --> 02:25:05.870
would you go on the Internet and fuck around and let go to message boards and
no,

2380
02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:09.360
nothing.
I don't,
you know,
and I,
and I even,
you know,

2381
02:25:09.361 --> 02:25:11.230
cause I knew they grew up with the,
you know,

2382
02:25:11.231 --> 02:25:15.810
the computer generation that even when they were kids,
I would say like,
look,

2383
02:25:16.470 --> 02:25:18.420
I know what's out there.
You know,
I could go though.

2384
02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:21.240
The one good thing about having me as a father,
as you know,

2385
02:25:21.241 --> 02:25:24.070
you could talk to me about anything.
You know,
you don't

2386
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:27.660
<v 2>have to watch your language if you're talking about a girl or you know,
right.</v>

2387
02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:30.460
You know,
you could,
you could talk straight to me.

2388
02:25:30.461 --> 02:25:34.390
Just tell me straight out and how it is.
And I would always tell my kids,

2389
02:25:34.750 --> 02:25:38.950
do yourselves a favor.
Stay away from,
from the porno on the Internet.

2390
02:25:39.250 --> 02:25:42.100
I go,
you're going to grow up.
You're going to start dating girls.

2391
02:25:42.101 --> 02:25:46.850
You don't want your mind twisted and bent that badly too late day.
Nope.

2392
02:25:47.740 --> 02:25:50.890
Too late.
No,
but,
but,
but it's the truth.
And you know,

2393
02:25:50.891 --> 02:25:52.690
Max was honest enough at that time,

2394
02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:56.590
he had a friend that went to it a few times and so we'll just stay away from,

2395
02:25:56.591 --> 02:25:59.290
this is also when I was like 12,
but what,
that's what I'm saying,

2396
02:25:59.291 --> 02:26:03.250
that's the age where like,
you know,
like you could see a thing like,
you know,
uh,

2397
02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:08.140
some chick blow in a horse and think,
oh,
that's what you supposed to do.
You know,

2398
02:26:08.141 --> 02:26:10.800
kids don't get it.
You know what I mean?
Earlier,
no,

2399
02:26:10.830 --> 02:26:12.790
no one fucking sick in the head.

2400
02:26:12.970 --> 02:26:16.540
Especially like early exposure to like really graphic sexual images like video

2401
02:26:16.541 --> 02:26:20.220
and porn.
It probably can be good for again,
it's probably not.
No,
it's shit.

2402
02:26:21.070 --> 02:26:24.910
It's impossible for to go hardcore type Shit,
you know.
And that guy is,

2403
02:26:25.660 --> 02:26:26.080
he's one of,

2404
02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:29.770
he's the only one of the only guys in recent memory that has been arrested for

2405
02:26:29.771 --> 02:26:33.370
um,
obscenity.
They took them to chick that took them a trial in Florida.

2406
02:26:33.371 --> 02:26:38.020
Has his videos are so obscene that they took this guy to trial in one state

2407
02:26:38.021 --> 02:26:40.370
because they knew that you can get them if they went in for,

2408
02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:44.240
to has very strict obscenity laws.
That's how they got two live crew in Florida.

2409
02:26:44.241 --> 02:26:47.830
I remember that shit when they got arrested.
Did you ever do an issue in Florida?

2410
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:50.680
Did you ever have any the in Florida,
I had it in Cleveland though,

2411
02:26:52.780 --> 02:26:56.080
the entire dress and I'll never forget,
you know,
cause management,

2412
02:26:56.081 --> 02:27:00.120
they try to keep you out of it.
And I come into my dressing room and uh,

2413
02:27:00.460 --> 02:27:04.200
well there's a problem,
you know,
and I'm like,
what's the,
does a,
you know,
a,

2414
02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:08.830
an arena or in Cleveland and all of a sudden the dressing room is flooded with

2415
02:27:08.831 --> 02:27:12.850
cops,
you know,
telling me if anybody complains,

2416
02:27:13.210 --> 02:27:17.470
anybody you're going to jail.
And I was like,

2417
02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:21.280
what year are we living hauling?
Oh shucks,
I'll tell you what.

2418
02:27:21.430 --> 02:27:25.600
You tell me what words you don't want me to say.
As long as I step on that stage,

2419
02:27:25.601 --> 02:27:30.130
I get my check.
I'll do five fucking minutes.
I don't care.
I got it.

2420
02:27:30.131 --> 02:27:35.131
But who would complain that it's buying a dice ticket cheeses and obviously

2421
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:40.150
hadn't got to jail.
What year was this?
This was probably around 93.

2422
02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:45.110
Holy Shit.
Yeah.
I mean,
yeah,
I went through some stuff that's,
you know,

2423
02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:49.300
you know,
with a three in Canada,
you know,

2424
02:27:49.301 --> 02:27:53.500
where they were really detain you on the bus and really go through everything.

2425
02:27:53.501 --> 02:27:57.460
And I'm go,
look,
we're not druggies on this bus with just doing comedy shows.

2426
02:27:57.700 --> 02:28:01.030
It's not what I do.
They can be rough when you crossed the border to Montreal.

2427
02:28:01.031 --> 02:28:04.780
But I've been lucky they mailed to take a walk in the snow that I had to take a

2428
02:28:04.781 --> 02:28:06.010
nap afterwards.

2429
02:28:06.011 --> 02:28:09.640
It was so hard and it was like four in the morning and means you walk in the

2430
02:28:09.641 --> 02:28:14.641
snow all the way to this fucking thing with our office was and all of us on the

2431
02:28:15.191 --> 02:28:18.520
bus.
You know,
I traveled with a band,
they traveled with my guys.

2432
02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:22.070
It's why Canada is so nice.
They have a zero douche bag rule.

2433
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:25.250
<v 0>If you're even remotely Douche.
Baggish at the,
the uh,</v>

2434
02:28:25.251 --> 02:28:29.090
the border patrol that I get the fuck Outta here man.
If you have a Dui,

2435
02:28:29.091 --> 02:28:33.800
get the fuck outta here.
If you have an assault,
get the fuck out.
You get a Dui,

2436
02:28:33.801 --> 02:28:36.740
you can't go to Canada.
Why can this offer you can never go too.

2437
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:39.240
It's why Canada is so awesome.
They want it.

2438
02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:43.060
They won't let in any American Douche bags is a,
I mean there's,

2439
02:28:43.270 --> 02:28:45.230
there's a fucking a smart thing to that,
you know,

2440
02:28:45.231 --> 02:28:47.690
you can really think about what you do.
You live in Canada,

2441
02:28:47.691 --> 02:28:51.320
you like a bunch of Nice people and this frozen country that's connected to the

2442
02:28:51.321 --> 02:28:54.980
craziest fucking savages that have ever existed are the face of the planet.

2443
02:28:55.310 --> 02:28:57.200
There's no,
no crazier country.

2444
02:28:57.201 --> 02:29:00.920
If you look at like total impact on the world than America,
Fuck Rome,

2445
02:29:00.921 --> 02:29:02.330
Rome can suck my dick.

2446
02:29:02.510 --> 02:29:05.630
We're in 140 different countries with fucking nuclear arms.

2447
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:08.930
We've got bombs and tanks and Jetson,
drones,

2448
02:29:08.931 --> 02:29:11.240
everybody should sit the fuck down and Kay.

2449
02:29:11.270 --> 02:29:14.870
So Canada is like above us and every now and then one of us is running from the

2450
02:29:14.871 --> 02:29:16.490
law and they try to get into Canada.

2451
02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:19.340
So of course they'd have to have like really fucking strict laws,

2452
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:21.950
any criminal tendencies and conditioners.

2453
02:29:22.070 --> 02:29:24.320
They saw that coming a long time ago and they were like,
Eh,

2454
02:29:24.350 --> 02:29:27.830
we got to shut it down.
I shut her.
Appreciate it.
I,

2455
02:29:27.870 --> 02:29:30.410
that's why I have such a great time up in Canada because they do that.

2456
02:29:30.411 --> 02:29:33.800
They're so stringent.
It is great.
The editor Canada really is awesome.

2457
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:37.340
It's amazing.
I'm at the River Creek Casino in June.
You're going to,

2458
02:29:37.341 --> 02:29:41.020
you're going to love that place.
Yeah,
I've been to a bunch of times.
Yeah,

2459
02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:43.240
I got them right here for you.
Uh,

2460
02:29:43.310 --> 02:29:48.310
so next Wednesday a dice will be at Westbury music fair and that is in Long

2461
02:29:48.910 --> 02:29:52.770
Island.
We're in Long Island,
Westbury,
Westbury.
Doug.

2462
02:29:53.390 --> 02:29:54.470
That's next Wednesday.

2463
02:29:54.471 --> 02:29:58.220
And then Friday and Saturday he said the joker's wild in new haven,
Connecticut.

2464
02:29:58.370 --> 02:30:01.070
My old stomping club.
I used to do that club,

2465
02:30:01.071 --> 02:30:03.830
but when I lived in new Rochelle and that should be a lot of fun.

2466
02:30:03.950 --> 02:30:08.090
And then a next Sunday,
this is the big one.
Asbury Park,
New Jersey.

2467
02:30:08.091 --> 02:30:10.700
Bamboozle.
And who you working with there?
Well,

2468
02:30:10.701 --> 02:30:13.430
I'm going on right before Bon Jovi.
Oh Shit.

2469
02:30:13.610 --> 02:30:17.870
Do my show and then he'll do it.
I don't know what stage I'm on,

2470
02:30:17.871 --> 02:30:21.770
but my show is the one right before I met Bon Jovi.
And uh,
he was,
uh,

2471
02:30:21.771 --> 02:30:24.380
I've met him a couple times.
I opened for them once in Queens,

2472
02:30:24.450 --> 02:30:28.160
did this MTV theater in the round.
They were very nice guys and I always had to,

2473
02:30:28.190 --> 02:30:30.050
you know,
pin it up.
I'm just real friendly guys.

2474
02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:32.330
But then I read this thing with him and his wife.

2475
02:30:32.360 --> 02:30:36.500
They own a restaurant and they have a restaurant where the people that go to the

2476
02:30:36.501 --> 02:30:39.140
restaurant pay whatever they can afford to pay.

2477
02:30:39.350 --> 02:30:41.630
So instead of like it'd be an a soup kitchen,

2478
02:30:41.780 --> 02:30:45.890
people can go with dignity and just pay whatever little money they have for it

2479
02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:49.390
for a nice meal and some they're like really compassionate,
nice people.

2480
02:30:49.550 --> 02:30:53.150
I've heard about that.
That's a wild concept.
That's a beautiful concept.
That's,

2481
02:30:53.151 --> 02:30:55.970
it's a beautiful thing that they do,
especially in this fucked up economy.

2482
02:30:56.120 --> 02:31:00.260
So props to Bon Jovi and you'll be here with him.
That's next Sunday.

2483
02:31:00.261 --> 02:31:04.550
Asbury Park,
New Jersey at bamboozle.
That should be fucking crazy,
dude.

2484
02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:08.210
Thank you very much.
It's been an honor for me as a comic.
Like I said,

2485
02:31:08.211 --> 02:31:11.210
when I came up,
man,
you were one of the guys that I really looked up to,

2486
02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:14.450
and so to have you on the podcast,
it's like a crazy experience for me.

2487
02:31:16.260 --> 02:31:20.130
Thanks.
Thanks again for back in the day,
given me advice.
And you really didn't,

2488
02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:23.700
you were the reason why I decided to go on the road because I listened to him

2489
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:26.640
and I was like,
yeah,
why don't I go on the road?
It may be a better comic too.

2490
02:31:26.641 --> 02:31:31.470
You know,
all the d just going up at the store,
only then Kinda make you monster.

2491
02:31:31.940 --> 02:31:32.611
You can become that.

2492
02:31:32.611 --> 02:31:36.840
You could get sucked into it's demonic spell if you ever become a real fucking

2493
02:31:36.841 --> 02:31:37.820
creep.
Uh,

2494
02:31:37.950 --> 02:31:41.520

2528
02:33:33.331 --> 02:33:34.890
between us.
