10
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.990
<v Speaker 1>but give me the thought like probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>

11
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.630
<v Speaker 1>I was disappointed in you and I love you</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a person.</v>

00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:26.740
<v Speaker 1>I think you're a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

14
00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

15
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.160
<v Speaker 1>I've always had a good time hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>

16
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.220
<v Speaker 1>but I was very disappointed with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that car accident.</v>

17
00:00:33.221 --> 00:00:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Then when you ran away from that car </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident,</v>

18
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.410
<v Speaker 1>that to me was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn John's in a bad place.</v>

19
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

20
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at a bad place.</v>

21
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a messed up situation,</v>

22
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally,</v>

23
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 2>I was an important mental life then when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was winning all these fights,</v>

24
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.553
<v Speaker 2>I was the boy in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sponsored by Nike and gator aid and </v>

25
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 2>greatest of all time finishing legends </v>
<v Speaker 2>after legend after legend.</v>

26
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm just really in this position where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>felt so untouchable and I just felt like</v>

27
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 2>I just felt like everything was meant to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go my way.</v>

28
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:11.950
<v Speaker 2>And that that time of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

29
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 2>started to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was obviously,</v>

30
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:15.670
<v Speaker 2>I was smoking pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.420
<v Speaker 2>majority of my career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dre man,</v>

32
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 2>too shy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drank and you know,</v>

33
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 2>every weekend pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

34
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:25.370
<v Speaker 2>to the point of blacking out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just locking out.</v>

35
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

36
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 2>just be at the hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

37
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 2>and just being a total party boy.</v>

38
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 2>But still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still training my butt off,</v>

39
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm working really hard,</v>

40
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 2>believing really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had big goals,</v>

41
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 2>big dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just being a party boy.</v>

42
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.503
<v Speaker 2>And I think I just took everything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I have for granted because everything </v>

43
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 2>for the majority of my career has come </v>
<v Speaker 2>my way.</v>

44
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.643
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that morning I got in a car </v>

45
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:49.381
<v Speaker 2>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

46
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

47
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

48
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 2>it was a huge reality check and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

49
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I think in some people's mind they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they envisioned me,</v>

50
00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting this car and running up and </v>

51
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 2>seeing that it was a pregnant lady and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then take it off Vernon.</v>

52
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 2>And then people said that I came back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and grabbed a load of money,</v>

53
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:12.120
<v Speaker 2>which is the stupidest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would a millionaire and need to grab</v>

54
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:13.410
<v Speaker 2>cash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

55
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Unless there's one back to the car.</v>

56
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 2>So I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went through a light,</v>

57
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a green light that says that</v>

58
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:24.984
<v Speaker 2>I could turn left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was supposed to yield for the </v>

59
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 2>right away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to turn left.</v>

60
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

61
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.593
<v Speaker 2>person came through and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just assumed it was my green light to </v>

62
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously being,</v>

63
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not completely clear headed.</v>

64
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 2>And I ended up running into a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

65
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.920
<v Speaker 2>I was definitely disoriented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm disoriented from the accident,</v>

66
00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:50.484
<v Speaker 2>from the accident for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just kind of like what the hell just </v>

67
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a really big hit.</v>

68
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was fine.</v>

69
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 2>I had no injuries and I just felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe it wasn't that bad of a hit.</v>

70
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.080
<v Speaker 2>So I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

71
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.813
<v Speaker 2>a step out of the car and I realized </v>
<v Speaker 2>like seconds later and I realized my </v>

72
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 2>bulls in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your bowl?</v>

73
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 2>My Ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

74
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:13.331
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

75
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:13.811
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

76
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my pop bought pot.</v>

77
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wasn't smoking weed in the car or </v>

78
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was in the car.</v>

79
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 2>But my bowl that had residue was in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

80
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 2>So I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I opened my car door,</v>

81
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to take two steps away from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>car and then I go back to the car and I,</v>

82
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.863
<v Speaker 2>I like search the car cause I had it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my cup holder and when I hit the bolt </v>

83
00:03:35.311 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 2>fell somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows where it flutes you.</v>

84
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.450
<v Speaker 2>But I knew I knew his shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't find that bull that's going</v>

85
00:03:43.071 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 2>to get me in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just having a ball on my car.</v>

86
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.173
<v Speaker 2>So I looked for like two seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton find the ball and I just took </v>

87
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:50.040
<v Speaker 2>off running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

88
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 2>did you look at the other person in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other car?</v>

89
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no clue that it was a woman.</v>

90
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 2>I had no clue that it was a pregnant </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

91
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 2>How much time are we talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like from the time was released,</v>

92
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.620
<v Speaker 2>from the time that I hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

93
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.400
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

94
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 2>I was over a fence probably eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds later.</v>

95
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was literally a super reactionary,</v>

96
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 2>like just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just felt I hadn't been home yet.</v>

97
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 2>I stay at a friend's house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't drinking and driving.</v>

98
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

99
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.283
<v Speaker 2>my decision was to sleep at my friend's </v>
<v Speaker 2>house because I knew I couldn't drive </v>

100
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:20.734
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He woke up early the next morning to go </v>

101
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:23.160
<v Speaker 2>to work and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

102
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 2>feel free to stay here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

103
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 2>you can make yourself breakfast or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

105
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.550
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

106
00:04:29.551 --> 00:04:30.384
<v Speaker 2>the guy has a family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a wife and he has a newborn baby </v>

107
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't want to stay at his house </v>
<v Speaker 2>while he's at work,</v>

108
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 2>so I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

109
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm okay.</v>

110
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 2>But really I had maybe like two hours of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep and,</v>

111
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize that I was still wasn't</v>

112
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 2>ready to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

113
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

114
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 2>I wake up and get in my car and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.940
<v Speaker 2>I just wasn't ready to drive or whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

116
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why didn't you look at the other car?</v>

117
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Because it all happened so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

118
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.211
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

119
00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 2>So it all happened so fast and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

120
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 2>I just knew I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I smelled like alcohol and,</v>

121
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just felt like if the police came out,</v>

122
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.410
<v Speaker 2>it would be a bad situation for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

123
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought the person that I hit had</v>

124
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 2>to have been okay because I was totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

125
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this collision wasn't that hard.</v>

126
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I just feel like in a lot of people's</v>

127
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 2>minds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they see me as like,</v>

128
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.040
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was this woman.</v>

129
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.873
<v Speaker 2>I saw this woman hanging out the window </v>
<v Speaker 2>crying and bleeding or something like </v>

130
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

131
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.550
<v Speaker 2>I just chose the lever and I didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I had it,</v>

132
00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I hit a truck,</v>

133
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:37.580
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know if I hit a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

134
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.863
<v Speaker 2>a punch bug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what it was that I hear </v>

135
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 2>that just knows another vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>B didn't even look,</v>

136
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't look wow.</v>

137
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't go back for cash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't make,</v>

138
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make a what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

139
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.740
<v Speaker 2>The fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

140
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Speaker 2>I didn't go back for cash and I really </v>
<v Speaker 2>went back for my boy,</v>

141
00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's no better.</v>

142
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

143
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.660
<v Speaker 2>the whole situation was just a shitty </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation I was in.</v>

144
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 2>I was in a really bad point in my life </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking,</v>

145
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything for granted.</v>

146
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted to have a,</v>

147
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.450
<v Speaker 2>a situation come up with just like worst</v>
<v Speaker 2>case scenario,</v>

148
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.760
<v Speaker 2>that is the worst case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnant woman.</v>

149
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me lack of monster.</v>

150
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me look a monster.</v>

151
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.280
<v Speaker 2>When you found out as a pregnant woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was,</v>

152
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 2>what was going through your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The man,</v>

153
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

154
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.453
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First I was afraid that there will be </v>

155
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 2>some type of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

156
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 2>problems with their baby because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

157
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 2>obviously if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she had a difficult pregnancy,</v>

158
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:34.154
<v Speaker 2>then that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole different level of being </v>

159
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:37.760
<v Speaker 2>in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

160
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 2>God forbid if she was having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>miscarriage,</v>

161
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

162
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that that would be 1000%</v>
<v Speaker 2>put on me.</v>

163
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:44.624
<v Speaker 2>So I thought about the fact that I went </v>
<v Speaker 2>from just partying and join this career </v>

164
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:52.040
<v Speaker 2>and this amazing fairytale life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

165
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.233
<v Speaker 2>I went from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was going from that to like </v>

166
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 2>literally being in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being labeled as a murderer.</v>

167
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 2>So that was my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my number one thing,</v>

168
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:04.140
<v Speaker 2>was just hoping that the baby was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about,</v>

169
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.770
<v Speaker 2>what were you thinking about yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you did that,</v>

170
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:07.604
<v Speaker 2>when you ran?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

171
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.160
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you can be happy with </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself that you did that.</v>

172
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 2>What were you thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

173
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

174
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.930
<v Speaker 2>me and my mom have a great relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a mama's boy.</v>

175
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

176
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.940
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm the father of four </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughters.</v>

177
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.200
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

178
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anything,</v>

179
00:07:24.271 --> 00:07:25.020
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

180
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.853
<v Speaker 2>my respect for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for women is I have tremendous respect </v>

181
00:07:30.151 --> 00:07:32.450
<v Speaker 2>for a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to like,</v>

182
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously that being a father I like,</v>

183
00:07:36.181 --> 00:07:37.014
<v Speaker 2>I tried to,</v>

184
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.260
<v Speaker 2>I just felt like a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like a monster,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I just felt terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt,</v>

187
00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:50.050
<v Speaker 2>I felt really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just,</v>

188
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.890
<v Speaker 2>I was mainly just concerned with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman's health and safety and I'm really</v>

189
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:56.920
<v Speaker 2>glad that she ended up being okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt really bad.</v>

190
00:07:56.921 --> 00:07:57.700
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

191
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Even in the public side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you just heard a pregnant woman.</v>

192
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really get worse than that,</v>

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.700
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
