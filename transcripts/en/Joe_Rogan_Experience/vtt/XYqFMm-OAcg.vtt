1
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.403
Oh,

2
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.440
<v 1>how good was big man</v>

3
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.550
with him.
It's,
it was,

4
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.720
it was in the hospital with Tupac and then it went dead with the biggest debt

5
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.500
and then it became hip hop and everybody was going out for dollars and they made

6
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:47.490
it a lot and it made a lot of shitty music except for m and m and JC,

7
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.650
maybe not Ralphie may dropping wrap knowledge.

8
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.670
Ralphie May's in the Harris,
ladies and gentlemen,
our guest,

9
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:59.390
he's very disgruntled at the world of rap music and I know it's your concern as

10
00:01:59.391 --> 00:01:59.780
well,

11
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.780
but this show and all shows a sponsor by the fleshlight Ralphy you ever felt a

12
00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:09.830
fleshlight,
sir?
No,
no one is fucked this it.
A lot of people fingered it.
Well,

13
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:13.670
you know Nate rubber tips.
This flashlight is not a virgin,

14
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.720
but it's like a slutty junior high school girl.
Been fingered a lot,
isn't it?

15
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.630
An amazing feels great,
right?
Pretty creepy dude.
It,

16
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.440
it's way better than just regular jerking off.

17
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.690
And the best thing is if you have somebody else hold it and fuck you,

18
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.830
it's even more detached from your own body.

19
00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:33.620
So it feels like you are actually having sex.
Have you done that,
Joe?

20
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:36.930
Have you had somebody else hold the flashlight for you and someone else there?

21
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.930
I'm going to fuck them.
Let's,
it's a boy.
Why is he holding it?
Well,

22
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.930
it's like the hand job.

23
00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:44.570
It's the newest hand job I me get the girl is going to give you a hand job

24
00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:47.220
nowadays.
Hey,
give me a hand job with a flashlight and state.

25
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:50.540
It's way better than a regular hand job.
Yeah.
Oh dude,
try it.
Have

26
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.280
a girl's hand is always going to feel better.
It's a shitty person touching you,

27
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.720
Ralph.
He says no,
but by its fruit,

28
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.980
can you come with glass gets I'll fuck everything was fast.

29
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.880
No Man.
What's wrong with you?
Come up.
A girl's giving given your hand job.

30
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:11.410
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah,
I know.
Even though you're doing,

31
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.630
I can't forget.
You need some more stimulation,
Percy.

32
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.510
Okay.
I've never even come from a blowjob.
What I'm saying?

33
00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:24.160
My Ralphy same way.
I do not like blow dry.

34
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.230
I mean it's the way girls are blowing youtube.

35
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.810
No,

36
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.660
I'm married.
I'm sealed man.
I like all my shit.

37
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.410
I just stay on the straight and narrow,
but that's not what I'm saying.

38
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.380
What I'm saying is even her,
even even,
oh yeah,
man.
Yeah,

39
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.220
my wife.
Horrible blow job.

40
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.890
Let's be honest.
A you,
it comes with the territory.

41
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.840
They Nag would then go with money and they get great kid,
Jewish girls.

42
00:03:57.841 --> 00:04:02.020
That was the reputation that they'd like to give blow jobs,
not this one.
Yeah,

43
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.690
that's what I always thought.
That stereotype.

44
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.910
I never heard of that ever.
Oh my God.
Yeah,

45
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.400
I've heard that.
Finally said that.
Good for the Jews.

46
00:04:13.401 --> 00:04:14.870
I don't mind the candle just for that one.

47
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.490
[inaudible] that we've had it for a seriously nine years.
10 years.

48
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.800
I found it in the garage.
I went and got a candle.
All right,

49
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.340
and the kids just going to sing happy birthday because this dollar note,

50
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.950
I don't know any Hanukkah songs.
I don't really think about it.

51
00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:31.740
My wife's met a good Jew.
Alright,
but I'm lighting a candle just for that one.

52
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.580
Just letting my daughter,
no,
she's got a good rep.

53
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.410
I always heard that j Jewish women are just the craziest and bed,

54
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.971
anything.

55
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:44.290
They're just this crazy sex machine in they shoes and she did fuck me.

56
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:49.150
So that makes me fucking crazy.
Yeah,
just I need to try it once.

57
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.530
Never tried a black girl.
No,

58
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.670
I'm as a lot of my get the Nero there was just like it.
Bingo.

59
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.840
You might get Deniro Dsi.
You don't even into white chicks anymore.

60
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:02.320
You might start talking like there's,
I was at BW three

61
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.950
Gangsta it out.
Come on baby.
No,

62
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.030
there's this black chick at BW three s last night.

63
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.220
Then the next move was so beautiful.

64
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.160
Those bungling you what happened?

65
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.690
You don't even have to tell him that man white dude.
He looks black chicks,

66
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.120
New Sun son.
Embrace your inner love of black chicks.

67
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.740
That's the next move for you,
sir.

68
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.780
That's some hard ass black chick that fucks the shit out of you and tells all

69
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:34.540
your ex girlfriend's a step like little camp.

70
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.800
So if you have any issues with ex-girlfriend's to get their scan of that black

71
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:42.550

The girl at the BW.

72
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:46.810
Three s in Burbank,
the bartender.
You are cute.
Whoa.

73
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.170
What are you a fucking five year old?
Go tell her in person,
but the tree,

74
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.600
I don't even use that word anymore.

75
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.740
I want to take you to the olive garden.
Ah,

76
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.730
Jesus Christ as their sponsor.
Brian,
sorry you.

77
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.740
How dare you.
How dare you come off like a 12 year old on the show.

78
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.560
I think you have by life.
Who Do you like mean?
Check one.
Yes,

79
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.240

You smell.
It really could just give out your aim.

80
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:19.970
I know you got one.
Here's your fucking Weirdo.
Here's my Facebook.

81
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.970
Ralphie may rocks.
It's so old school.
He doesn't even have a Twitter.

82
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.960
How do you like them apples?
That's almost not exist.

83
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.820
You text,
you text a lot.
Yeah,
and I'm sick.
It's just takes out to,

84
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:33.940
you got to get on the Twitter.

85
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.250
The person who pull out their Ralphie did want to talk to you,
man.
They're happy.

86
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:40.930
You're on the show today.
And they go to my shows and they say,
what's up?
Oh yeah,

87
00:06:40.931 --> 00:06:43.520
there is a lot of people actually they,
um,

88
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.690
today I got a lot of phone messages of people saying,

89
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.590
cause like a lot of comics watches a podcast.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cool.

90
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.400
I gotta move this out of my face.
This is freaking me out.
Sorry.

91
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.510
Go back a little bit.
That's right when you're shooting a gun.
And

92
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.560
I'm like trying to move around it while I'm looking at you on the podcast.

93
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.100
Dan Microphones.
Dan Rather was in his mouth so,
well,
yeah,

94
00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:11.200
you got to use the Twitter mountains.
It's very important.

95
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.700
There's a lot of people that want to talk to you.

96
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.450
And not only is it good for promotion,
it's great for writing comedy,

97
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.320
choke beginning talking shit about things.
It's fun.
Yep.
But I'm nervous.

98
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.910
I'm nervous that
I would become too exposed.

99
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.860
What are you talking about?
Like,
you know,
uh,
I have become too exposed as,

100
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.660
as like,
you know,
a go to guy for free.
You know what I mean?
It's like,

101
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:39.050
you know,
am I going to,
I write hours and hours of material,
you know,

102
00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:41.150
right now I have three and a half,

103
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.270
maybe four hours in rotation that I do separately.
Awesome.

104
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.600
And it's all different stuff and it's all the same basic thing.

105
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.500
And so I find myself just writing the same thing over and over again in a

106
00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:56.510
different form and a different subject.
You know what I mean?

107
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.180
The same formula and I'm nervous that I would get polluted by other comedians

108
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.650
and I just don't want to open myself up polluted by other comedians.

109
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.260
You don't have to follow in it but he don't want to follow and you can some

110
00:08:08.261 --> 00:08:10.990
people like I don't think Louis C K for the longest time didn't follow anybody.

111
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.890
Zero followers really.
She was a fucking only applied heads,

112
00:08:14.891 --> 00:08:18.520
never replied to anybody's zero followers.
You try to make her reply,

113
00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:22.210
she will not do it.
And she almost seems like she's like an app like typing,

114
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.630
you know it just automatically puts something sexy and mixed with something.

115
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.320
You might be absolutely right about that because I've read some of those that

116
00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:32.920
she writes cause they like been featured on websites and shit and they're crazy.

117
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.210
They're all like,
you know,

118
00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:37.570
I'm going to go down to this high school and try to get five dudes to shoot

119
00:08:37.571 --> 00:08:42.250
loads in me.
I'm at the airport right now.
I have dried calm and my face,

120
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.570
but if you watch your videos you're like,
well she's obviously for real.

121
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.210
She is throwing down Bri Olsen.
She's funny,
very popular,

122
00:08:52.211 --> 00:08:56.100
Young Porno Star with a wonderful personality and I have excellent

123
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.750
<v 2>sense of humor.
She Brody Stevens,
he gets set,
take meat.</v>

124
00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:05.190
She can take meat.
It's weird,
man.
We've talked about this on the podcast before,

125
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:10.191
but was she one of the girls and like the biggest slut contest for how to start?

126
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.030
I don't know.
Maybe.
Yeah,
I think you're probably right.

127
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.860
She was talking about as she'd fuck a retard and fun.

128
00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.280
I love it.
I can tell her that's all those girls that do those gang bangers.
Man.

129
00:09:23.281 --> 00:09:27.720
That's a different species.
Dang man.
That's another human bro.

130
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:29.760
That's another kind of speaking to another human.

131
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:34.320
I saw Jay London picking up trash on.
Laurel Canyon creep me out.

132
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.440
He was picking up trash for somebody and see working.
My man,
he had a,

133
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.680
he had an orange jacket,
orange vest on him,

134
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:47.070
like say something and he got arrested.
I don't know.

135
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:52.060
That's not what usually that is.
You get arrested sometimes.
I think so man.

136
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.000
I think so.
And it was crazy.
It wasn't last comic standing.

137
00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:01.080
No,
no,
no.
I'm like the next one he was on the next one.

138
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.550
You know Jay and I were on the,

139
00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:06.510
for the first TV show I ever did in 19 I think it was 92 it was a lot of

140
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:07.770
spotlight cafe,

141
00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:12.540
this weird show in New York and Jay was on it with me and that I always thought

142
00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:14.860
like,
wow,
this guy is so quirky and interesting.
Like this guy,

143
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.170
he's going to be a famous comedian.

144
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.990
And then he got on last comic standing and I'm like,
wow,
here it goes.

145
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:19.950
Maybe people and you know,

146
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.670
people started recognizing him at the comedy store and then nothing happened.

147
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.220
I'll stop.
It just went away.

148
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.380
Have done the best of anybody of capitalizing on that last comic standing proud

149
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:34.170
and running with it.
You ran with that shit dude.

150
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:37.320
There's a lot of guys who like John Heffron ran with it pretty well too,

151
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.100
but I think you ran with it even better.
You were prolific,

152
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.470
highlighted you more than anyone and that you're the only person on that show

153
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:51.180
that when I watched it,
when it was originally on,
I saw you blow up audiences.

154
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.640
I mean you just destroyed on that show.

155
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.490
You like a regular last comic standing person,

156
00:10:56.491 --> 00:10:59.130
you are tearing up rooms to

157
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.560
<v 1>me and told me and show me the minutes from the MVC meeting.</v>

158
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.100
Okay.
Like he probably shouldn't have.

159
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:12.730
And he told me that they were nervous about having someone my size on NBC a lot,

160
00:11:13.611 --> 00:11:17.510
especially in prime time.
Worried about what you're dying or something?
No,

161
00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:19.520
just the image it would put out there.

162
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:24.580
They were embarrassed by my sides and I feel like it's crushing.

163
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.660
Um,
but I,
I use it as motivation and he goes,

164
00:11:29.661 --> 00:11:33.310
the only way they're not going to uh,
uh,

165
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.880
get you off of this is if you get a standing ovation every show.

166
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.080
That's the only way they can deny it.

167
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:45.140
It's because we can't retake that tape and that,

168
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.080
and he goes,
we won't be able to,
if you every joke kills,

169
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.360
we won't be able to show you bombing.
What is it?

170
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.220
He goes,
if,
if every

171
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.900
<v 3>joke of your as kills,
right,</v>

172
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:01.200
then we won't be able to show that you bombed to tell you that you lost it.

173
00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.920
You show the audience that you lost me.
No,

174
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.860
you have to get a standing ovation every show and every joke be your hardest

175
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:10.030
that you've ever delivered it.

176
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.630
That's the only way these people aren't going to get you outta here.

177
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.100
<v 1>Wow.</v>

178
00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.600
So they were plotting to get you out from the beginning because of the way you,

179
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:25.590
your body is.
Wow.
Wow.
But yet now one of the shows on TV,

180
00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:27.040
on NBC as big as loser.

181
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.360
Well for those folks who don't listen on iTunes and you don't,

182
00:12:30.361 --> 00:12:33.600
you're not familiar with Ralphie is how,
how big are you?
Ralphy uh,

183
00:12:33.601 --> 00:12:38.550
right now I'm a four 18 418 pounds.
Well that's dumb.

184
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.400
Down from over 700.
Wow.
I know.

185
00:12:41.401 --> 00:12:43.530
I've lost a whole fuck a fat guy and I'm still fat.

186
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.400
Not that much of an accomplishment.
Hundred at one point.
Yeah.

187
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.240
We'll get you a member of the back of the company was store.

188
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.000
Do you want her to take me to the Strip joint?

189
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.460
Just to see any grill getting there?
My Dick and,

190
00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.600
and you wouldn't throw me in your accurate and it,

191
00:13:00.601 --> 00:13:04.680
there was no fucking getting in.
NSX was not having,
it was sick.

192
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.860
It was a sick card,
but there was no way I was getting in there.
And I'm like,

193
00:13:07.861 --> 00:13:10.470
I love you Joe Rogan.
I love your heart.
I love your heart.

194
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:14.190
You have tried to care for her.
But what cars are going,
Huh?
Not Anymore.

195
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.630
Not Anymore.
They're all pretty much,
you know what I mean?

196
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:21.390
I got into ridiculous $600,000 Mercedes Benz,

197
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.090
so to see what it thousand dollars for a Mercedes

198
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.880
convertible and it's like 700 horse power and it's a,
Oh,

199
00:13:29.881 --> 00:13:33.360
I know what you're talking about.
It's like AMG some shit.

200
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.990
It was in Beverly Hills,
Mercedes Mailton.

201
00:13:35.991 --> 00:13:38.460
My friend as comedian is the sales manager there.

202
00:13:38.461 --> 00:13:41.310
I don't think it's not Ron Robertson.
I think it's three 50 no,

203
00:13:41.311 --> 00:13:45.150
it's six 49 200 inch plasma TVs in the trunk.
I'm wrong.

204
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.290
Kind of another model.
Yeah,
it's just bad at,

205
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.820
but totally the most uncomfortable car I've ever been.
Yeah.
But my beamer,

206
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.130
I got six 50 I

207
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.590
<v 3>convertible and it's fun.
I don't have no problem.</v>

208
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.500
<v 1>No Ralph,
he says,
no problem.
I'm all about comfort.
Ever since I got my new car,</v>

209
00:14:03.501 --> 00:14:07.610
it's like the biggest mom car ever.
You know,
it's a Ford Edge,
but I,
you know,

210
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.110
it's so comfortable.
It's fucking comfortable and it's so techie like I will,

211
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.960
you know everything.
I love it.

212
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.950
I'm telling you what American cars I fucking making a comeback.
See time man

213
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.880
and your lower back.
Do you don't feel it.
The fatigue.
They have a little drive.

214
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:30.520
Shelby Shelby gt 500 ooh convertible.
Yeah,
cause you're good.
So it's,

215
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.060
this was the dumbest one ever though.

216
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:36.480
All you have to do is anytime you want stomp on the gas and the cargo sideways,

217
00:14:36.481 --> 00:14:38.290
sideways,
right?
Just start spinning wheels.

218
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:44.460
And it's a tiny car.
It's lightweight.

219
00:14:44.461 --> 00:14:48.390
It's got to live rear axle.
So it handles like shit.
But it's fun.

220
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.370
You stomp on the gas.
Just leaves rubber dude.

221
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.470
It's a pure American experience.
A car like that.
Like,
yeah,

222
00:14:56.471 --> 00:14:59.270
it's not sophisticated.
It's not the best way to get around.

223
00:14:59.271 --> 00:15:02.450
Not the best handling,
but God damn,
that shit is fun.
It's fun.
Yeah.

224
00:15:02.451 --> 00:15:06.720
You stomped on the gas.
It's 550 horsepower and it's supercharged and so it's,

225
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.270
you hear the supercharger whine

226
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.480
you the V eight and the will the wine in here.

227
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.160
<v 4>Wow.
That's</v>

228
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.030
<v 1>getting it done.
Oh,
this,
it's like a different thing.
It's not just driving,</v>

229
00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.700
it's not just getting in your fucking,
your Yukon and you know,

230
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.330
going to the supermarket.
There's something extra fun about it.

231
00:15:25.331 --> 00:15:28.420
Very irresponsible.
It is,
man.
It's like James Bond makes him dangerous.

232
00:15:28.421 --> 00:15:31.780
Shit can have it anytime.
It's just a fun,
it's just fun.

233
00:15:31.781 --> 00:15:36.660
Even if you're not speeding,
it's fun.
The Lurch of it.
Just the rumble,

234
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.220
the you feel the power in those cars.
I sit here,

235
00:15:39.221 --> 00:15:43.290
my turn single when I go around this neighborhood age is awesome.
It's like,

236
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.590
but those are good cars.
Fuck it,
man.
Yeah.
You're already behind.

237
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.560
You're making yourself over.

238
00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.360
You're turning in Armenia mean you've got your moving to Glendale,

239
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.900
you got the beard,
you're 10 and then ever is that the next Move Glendale?

240
00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:00.850
I'm think.
Well,
my beard says yes.
I want to go to the beach.

241
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.470
I've just,
I can't take it anymore.

242
00:16:02.471 --> 00:16:05.860
I need to go to the beach and not as something that's calling you about rarely.

243
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.870
Yeah.

the vibe,
the vibe and the beach.

244
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.910
He's full man and everyone knows everyone.
It's,
I totally agree.
Yeah.

245
00:16:15.911 --> 00:16:20.050
I think there's some homeless and it's steaky.
Oh yeah,
Santa Monica.

246
00:16:20.051 --> 00:16:22.000
But you could play it el Ray.

247
00:16:22.001 --> 00:16:25.840
You got down to her most sites wider than holding traffic,
getting there.

248
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.460
White people.
What is way white people and that no homeless people,

Yeah.
The,
the whole,

You know,

253
00:16:45.461 --> 00:16:49.960
the real problem is they don't need to kill these fucking crazy assholes in

254
00:16:49.961 --> 00:16:53.260
Mexico.
They're just gunning people down for cocaine.

256
00:16:58.451 --> 00:16:59.690

257
00:16:59.691 --> 00:17:03.820
I wreck us laws is 5,000 let's put it in perspective.

258

How many people that really is.

It's pretty crazy.

259
00:17:06.701 --> 00:17:10.400
And that's the ones they know about.
Yeah.
I thought the heads of the desert.
Okay.

260
00:17:10.401 --> 00:17:13.490
There's lots of that shit.

ICICLES.

It's the border towns especially,
I mean,

262
00:17:16.361 --> 00:17:20.950
it's really crazy right now in most Americans are blissfully unaware.
Oh,

263
00:17:20.951 --> 00:17:25.540
It is down there.
They have no idea,

264
00:17:25.541 --> 00:17:28.750
Texas,

265
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.890
You were out the door.
It used to be nice.
She used to go across the border.

266
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.450
You know you go down like I have a weekend of San Antonio and then Sunday night

267
00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.150
go down there,
they'll get a great deal.
Like a,
a great hotel.

268
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.610
The holiday in there,
it was safe.
It was nice.
You go to a Nouveau Laredo,

269
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.580
cross the bridge,

270
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:50.190
bring back glass and plates and stuff like that and it was awesome living.

271
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:55.230

Yeah.
Okay,

It was just a great river valley.
Okay.

272

Town smelled like cigars everywhere.
It was smelling like great thanks guys.

The guy.

How about candy?
Anything in that?

274
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:06.290
Ron White smells like
guys.

275
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.400
He told me one time to bring a weed and I'm like,

276
00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:14.490
you're the only guy ever to ask anyone to bring weed to Mexico.

277
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:18.460
What are you talking about?
Go talk to somebody.
Bring Weed to Mexico.
Yeah,

278
00:18:18.461 --> 00:18:19.470
that sounds,
we wanted me to come.

279
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:24.420
The whole idea we to or back from Mexico sounds like a terrible idea,

280
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.130
man.
Taking wheat into gloms a bad idea.
Yeah.
Let me hear that story.
Sun.
This is,

281
00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:33.070
this is a Ralphie may classic that's making the rounds and uh,
I'm,

282
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.060
I don't know all the details so I want to hear the whole deal.
Cause you got,

283
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.100
you got arrested somewhere.

284
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.590
<v 3>Yeah,
I got,
I got stopped in Guam,
uh,</v>

285
00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.710
for weed.
I didn't know I had it on me.
All right.

286
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:50.550
And I took out of my bag,
three and a half ounces of weed.

287
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:55.820
Uh,
a full ounce of Keith and about 20 grams a hash.
God.

288
00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.790
Damn.
That's what I took out of my back.

289
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.440
He took it out before he went to the airport.
He took all that stuff.

290
00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.380
You may wants to party.
Yeah,
I like to get down.
I like variety.
You know,
I've,

291
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.300
I mean,
you look at me,
I've got no fucking control.
Okay.

292
00:19:08.301 --> 00:19:13.250
Have Anything Joe Rogan look at me except Mez.
Okay.
Yeah,

293
00:19:13.251 --> 00:19:17.360
that maybe the control over your loads.
Look,
you got really good control.

294
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:24.110
The one thing I've got for me,
um,
but I'm a mess.
I mean,

295
00:19:24.111 --> 00:19:28.490
I've got no sense.
Plus,
I get tons of heavy handshakes.
I mean,
and those,

296
00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.750
these guys aren't Phelan and sent me the throw in an eighth.
Right?
So quarter,

297
00:19:32.751 --> 00:19:36.850
you know,
when I tell them how it was stone and saw,
uh,
the,

298
00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.760
the miracle on the Hudson happened,
I would just afterwards,
okay,

299
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:45.580
we were down there at Chelsea piers and people running.

300
00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.730
That's what a fucking cop on a horse.
I am stoned out of my fucking mind.

301
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.350
I in my Hammock,
I sound stone like a biblical whore and I,

302
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:59.750
I'm fucking wasted.
And I'm like walking seriously.

303
00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.490
I'm fucked up.

304
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.510
Like if it wasn't like 29 degrees and sunny,

305
00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.750
I would have passed the fuck out.
I was that high.
Wow.

306
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.570
I had a big thing of Hash and I put that in the middle.

307
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:15.830
I made a Joey Diaz Cuban sandwich with a Oh Geez.

308
00:20:15.831 --> 00:20:20.831
On the sativa on the top and then a big fucking chunk,

309
00:20:21.141 --> 00:20:25.320
a hash over a gram and um,
uh,

310
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:29.070
an Oji finish.
Okay.
Yeah,
that's,

311
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.580
and I was the one of the most fucked up I've ever been.

312
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.760
And I'm walking and in so much I'm seeing people run from the end of the period

313
00:20:35.761 --> 00:20:38.360
to the edge overhead helicopters.

314
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:43.010
I see a cop on a fucking horse and I'm like,
wow.
And he was within 20 feet of me.

315
00:20:43.011 --> 00:20:47.030
And I'm like,
where the fuck are you going to Sundance?
It made,
it won't appear.

316
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.660
Okay.
You're on a fucking peer.
There's people all around,
you know,

317
00:20:49.661 --> 00:20:53.770
my kid has been my wife's arms,
you know the fuck.
Wow.
Okay.

318
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.560
And,
and we went down there to go see that.
I'm a kind of,
uh,
uh,
uh,

319
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:02.830
aviation buck and the air.
Was it the blackboard spy plane?

320
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.630
The AI 71?
I think it was.
Um,
it's the fastest plane.
We have a bill,
you know,

321
00:21:07.631 --> 00:21:11.980
that we told anyone about and it's fucking cool as shit because on its last

322
00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:16.960
voyage it flew from New York to la or la to New York and like 38 minutes,

323
00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:22.020
something insane.
Speed La to New York and 38 next time traveling Nigga.
That's,

324
00:21:22.021 --> 00:21:24.580
that's how real can look it up.

325
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.640
Ar 17 ar some her 17 blackbird [inaudible] 71 [inaudible] 71.

326
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.940
No,
no,
no.
It was a 71.
It's a blackboard spy plane.
So do wow.

327
00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:41.290
Check that fucker out.
And it was the,
was the last declassified flight of,

328
00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.090
it was the only one that they showed the speed and,
and we,

329
00:21:45.091 --> 00:21:48.760
we retired this motherfucker.
Why would you ever retire this thing?

330
00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:52.030
Can you put it up there,
Bruh?
I Dunno how to do all that shit.

331
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.720
You're amazing.
I got an IPAD APP.
It was a friend.

332
00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.600
<v 5>This thing goes 2000 miles an hour.</v>

333
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.780
<v 3>So then it couldn't have gone.
It could've been,
yeah.</v>

334
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.740
<v 5>This is what they did in one hour and 54 minutes.</v>

335
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.170
They went from New York to London.

336
00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:12.490
That's the six hour flight.
They did it an hour and 54.

337
00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:17.180
<v 3>They went from the last one,
the flu,
the one that's at the,
uh,
um,</v>

338
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.710
uh,
the battleship there.
Was it the intrepid.
Okay.

339
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.800
And Damage Chelsea Piers.
All right.
That's what I wanted to go see.

340
00:22:24.801 --> 00:22:29.320
I wanted to be high and be close to that fucking jet.
Right.
I mean that's,

341
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.580
that's almost Tom Chaplain.
I mean,
do you understand?
Dude,

342
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.610
that's fucking mom blowing.

343
00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.930
<v 5>Oh,
still hours.
You can leave London.</v>

344
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:41.030
You can have tea in London and lunch and dinner in New York City and not miss a

345
00:22:41.151 --> 00:22:43.800
fucking big bro.
That's amazing.

346
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.020
There's transfer shit.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's amazing.

347
00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.270
You know what's really crazy is they used to have that,
um,

348
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.630
that Concord that you could fly to Europe.
Yes.
No solid plane.
Cool.
Shit.

349
00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.680
I used to go super high.
It was like way higher than a regular plane.

350
00:22:57.681 --> 00:23:01.460
So it literally,
like you were on the border of fucking space,
inner a space,

351
00:23:01.461 --> 00:23:04.940
going to the speed of sound.
Fucking a man.

352
00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.200
Stop and think about a plane that goes as fast as fucking sound and you're

353
00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:13.750
sitting in that bitch.
Just fuck it.
Yeah.

354
00:23:13.751 --> 00:23:15.560
You don't feel the g force because they just,

355
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:20.370
they don't make any sudden moves and they just totally amp it up saying say it

356
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:24.170
and just go straight up and straight down.
So cool sound man.

357
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:29.180
The speed of sound in a fucking plane,
but it kept killing too many rich folks.

358
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.710
Boy.
Right.
People,
the attitude they fucked up.
But I think the last one,

359
00:23:33.711 --> 00:23:36.920
I think it was a really dumb fuck up too.
It's like somebody hit a tire there,

360
00:23:36.921 --> 00:23:38.000
was left on the track,

361
00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:43.190
the Concorde hit it and fucking caused a gigantic explosion.

362
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.040
Never let it died.
When

363
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.180
<v 2>those people are dying and they're dying.</v>

364
00:23:47.181 --> 00:23:52.010
And these are people that are paying like $10,000 a ticket type t more than that

365
00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.330
last rites glass.
Yeah.
Right.
So $10,000 she was like regular,
right?
Yeah.

366
00:23:56.331 --> 00:23:57.140
For like economy.

367
00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.950
Economy is $10,000 and it's just to save a few hours of your time.

368
00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.810
That's really what it is.
It's just ended because cool.
Novelty effect of it.

369
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:10.130
I remember I was watching some talk show as a kid and there was an actor who

370
00:24:10.131 --> 00:24:13.010
said the coolest thing he'd ever done it was take that Concord.
Yeah.

371
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.420
And then stand on his seat.
So he was the highest person in the world.
Whoa.

372
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:22.490
That's hilarious.
And he's right.
He's like,
he stood at his feet and he was,

373
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:27.440
well,
the a live person.
No.
There was no astronauts into orbit at that time.

374
00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.170
Right.
There was nothing going on.
Planes still freaked me out.

375
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.120
Just the idea that you're in this metal tube,

376
00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:35.470
it's 30,000 feet in the air and you're just sitting there and you're just

377
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.880
chillin and looking at your iPad and your,

378
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:42.890
Your Adam's are holding us up is visible as connected from the ground.

379
00:24:43.611 --> 00:24:45.860
That's where I want to be.
Want to be on the ground where it's safe.

380
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.130
You have no fucking feed up there.
Ooh.

381
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.520
I get a lot of anxiety when a fly.

382
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.060
What do you think they have that we don't know about?

383
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:57.960
One of the things you said about the SR 71 you said it was the fastest plane

384
00:24:57.961 --> 00:25:02.030
that day that we have that we know about that we haven't told.
What about,
yeah.

385
00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.800
Do you think,
well,
it would just seem to reason.
I mean when,
yeah,

386
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.460
<v 3>logic that if you made that much progress in 30 years,</v>

387
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.450
that that,
you know,
exponentially if you take the same progress,

388
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:19.780
like in cell phones in the last 20 years from a briefcase with a cord and a

389
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:25.160
headset,
and then,
and then the move down was the brick.
Okay.
That was the,

390
00:25:25.161 --> 00:25:29.270
after that.
Okay.
That same technology,
now they're microscopic and they can,

391
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.790
you ain't no cut tons of data.
I mean,

392
00:25:31.791 --> 00:25:36.620
you just take that same stream of technology and apply that to that another

393
00:25:36.621 --> 00:25:40.340
sector where we're spending billions and billions and billions of dollars on

394
00:25:40.341 --> 00:25:42.800
projects that we don't even know about.
Fuck yeah.

395
00:25:42.801 --> 00:25:45.740
There's gotta be something faster.
I want to know about,

396
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.780
I want to know about harp up in Alaska.
I want to know about,
um,

397
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:55.160
the f f 23 that,
uh,

398
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.580
supposedly can hover and,
uh,
um,

399
00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:03.320
and it's a scram jet.
Okay.
I want to know about that.
Uh,

400
00:26:03.321 --> 00:26:08.280
that it could fly at 120,000 feet.
Okay.
And I can go from,
uh,

401
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.780
it can go from,
uh,
last and well outside of Las ad,
uh,

402
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.470
Las Vegas supposedly.
Eh,
fuck,
it takes off.

403
00:26:15.471 --> 00:26:19.090
And then it refuels at about 90,000 feet.
No,

404
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.950
45,000 feet on its way to 90,000 feet.

405
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.000
And then it hits the APP stores meets those clean and refueled in the air.

406
00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.630
How dope is that?
They refuel in the fucking sky.
Yeah,

407
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:33.010
and from the fuck are they doing that man?
I don't know.

408
00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:38.220
And then it's the cleanest burning and it's a fastest and people can go from a

409
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:44.100
last,
it'll be all over the Pacific where there's no body.
They fucking,

410
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.160
they refuel and then they hit that scram jet and they got 120 140,000 feet,

411
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:54.270
like the outer atmosphere shit.
And then bounce back off of it.
And,
and what?

412
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:55.490
You don't understand what you,

413
00:26:55.491 --> 00:26:58.320
if you go straight up and you continue in a straight line,

414
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.320
the earth is moving in like 17,000 miles per hour.

415
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.920
So that's adding to your speed.
Fuck a trippy.

416
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:08.400
When you add altitude and then gravity on top of that compounding.

417
00:27:08.401 --> 00:27:12.090
So you're falling much faster,
you know,
thousands,

418
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:17.280
it could go up to theoretically 3000 miles per hour,
4,000 miles per hour.

419
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:19.560
Fucking amazing.

420
00:27:19.561 --> 00:27:22.910
Do you guys remember how cool it was in the 80s and then about that blackbird?

421
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.340
Remember the blackbird?
It was like the f 15 or whatever.

422
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:30.300
<v 5>Where's it was like a wrap your head around that kind of fucking speed.
No Man,</v>

423
00:27:30.301 --> 00:27:33.470
it's ton traveling,
man.
That's the closest we're ever going to get.

424
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.360
I wonder if they have some shit that's not released.

425
00:27:36.361 --> 00:27:39.600
It's even faster than what we know about like three or four times the speed of

426
00:27:39.601 --> 00:27:40.434
sound.
So I'm really,

427
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.470
<v 3>what about,
what about that decommissioned a supercollider in Waxahachie,</v>

428
00:27:45.471 --> 00:27:50.060
Texas that's still a federal off limits facility that uh,

429
00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:55.150
that say we did say we created the God particle like they did in Switzerland and

430
00:27:55.731 --> 00:27:59.570
which is a controlled microscopic,
a subatomic black hole.

431
00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:04.400
And then the energy explodes off that we collect that theoretically that in a

432
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:08.810
bottle,
any matter we could,
we could stream banging each other in,

433
00:28:08.811 --> 00:28:11.470
control that black hole that we could,
uh,

434
00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.710
in the left of water get boomed from there.

435
00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:20.740
We could fuel all of North America's energy sources in an amazing,

436
00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.220
it's fucking unbelievable.
They've the super colliding shit.
Right?

437
00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.420
<v 5>That's right.
I mean,
it's fascinating,
but I mean,
I think those,</v>

438
00:28:27.421 --> 00:28:30.240
the idea behind the making the little black holes that they don't have enough

439
00:28:30.241 --> 00:28:34.830
gravity to stay alive.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They die out.
Well,
that's the,
well,

440
00:28:34.831 --> 00:28:38.580
the scary version thinking that someone's doing something with the one that they

441
00:28:38.581 --> 00:28:39.840
have in Texas.
Is that what you're saying?

442
00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:44.380
<v 3>Yeah.
That it's not Mindy commissioned,
you know,
and that it's being used.
I mean,</v>

443
00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:49.400
the fucking government uses everything else from the 50s they're going to,

444
00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.310
they're going to drop,
you know,

445
00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:55.360
800 billion in a fucking hole in the Waxahatchee and then just say,
fuck it.

446
00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:56.223
We're out.

447
00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:59.380
<v 5>Well,
I don't believe that they're doing sunding thing though.
You know,</v>

448
00:28:59.381 --> 00:29:02.230
a lot of times there's just not enough money to run shit if they don't think

449
00:29:02.231 --> 00:29:05.680
they're going to get a direct result off of the experiments.
Like,
what is,

450
00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.510
what's going to be profitable out of these experiences?

451
00:29:07.511 --> 00:29:11.350
What military applications is going to come from this experiment?

452
00:29:11.351 --> 00:29:14.680
And if there's none,
it's real hard to justify when the economy goes to shit.

453
00:29:14.681 --> 00:29:16.630
They clothes things like that down all the time.

454
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.860
But I mean is it really close though?
So we're still spending,

455
00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:24.790
they're doing something,
some crazy shit man.

456
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:29.140
The whole area 51 is the most fascinating thing to me that they had a whole area

457
00:29:29.141 --> 00:29:33.400
that they denied even existed until I think it was like in the late nineties

458
00:29:33.401 --> 00:29:35.700
they tried to expand the boundaries of it and they will,

459
00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.100
they had to claim more land for to be restricted.

460
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.470
And then they had admitted it exists in the place.

461
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.590
But for the longest time there was just people waiting with guns.

462
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.910
But too many dudes found like this spot in the hills where you could watch them

463
00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:53.230
experiment with their Aircrafts and too many guys who worked there who either

464
00:29:53.231 --> 00:29:57.280
got fired or went crazy and like Bob Lazard,
no,
he is.

465
00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.280
He's the guy that,
you know,
he's,
he's been ridiculed.

466
00:30:00.281 --> 00:30:03.670
A lot of people say that he's full of shit and he lied about his education

467
00:30:03.671 --> 00:30:06.010
background.
I don't know what's the case or what's not the case.

468
00:30:06.011 --> 00:30:09.490
But his story that on a resume to get a job.
Yeah,

469
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.850
but you need to say I had degrees in places,

470
00:30:12.851 --> 00:30:16.060
they said he'd never enrolled and there's like old yearbooks from those times

471
00:30:16.061 --> 00:30:17.340
and he does.
He's not in the yearbook.

472
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:21.820
So it seems like at the very least he's made some things up.
So you know,

473
00:30:21.821 --> 00:30:24.100
you gotta you gotta look at it and say,
well he probably made it all up.

474
00:30:24.101 --> 00:30:27.160
But the point is he would take his friends to watch these things flying in the

475
00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:29.560
air and he said he worked there and they arrested them there and once they

476
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:31.840
arrested him there,
there's like a,
you know,

477
00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:35.650
it was his big story and he came out and said there was flying saucers there and

478
00:30:35.651 --> 00:30:38.320
that he had worked on him and tried to back engine the emirate fucking

479
00:30:38.321 --> 00:30:40.570
fascinating shit.
But the point,

480
00:30:40.571 --> 00:30:44.470
the number one point is there really is a place where they're doing secret shit

481
00:30:44.471 --> 00:30:47.650
and they didn't want people to know about it and they had to tell them more than

482
00:30:47.651 --> 00:30:48.484
one of these.

483
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:51.070
Once they had satellites and satellite started flying over and taking

484
00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:51.910
photographs of it.

485
00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.090
And people could see like the whole facility and groom Lake and you could see

486
00:30:55.091 --> 00:30:56.830
all these,
you know,
these air hangers,

487
00:30:56.831 --> 00:30:59.380
like they're doing some nutty shit out there,
man.
They're,
they're like,

488
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:03.100
that's where they're making like shuffling stealth bombers and yeah,

489
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.000
that's just the shit on and stuff.
Yeah,

490
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:09.460
there's video technology's bad acid as it is.
He's 30 fucking years old.

491
00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.890
I think a lot of what they're doing is drones.
Man.
There's,

492
00:31:11.891 --> 00:31:16.150
there's a fascinating theme of these people.
This is before they shut it down,

493
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.760
these people were watching like from,
you know,

494
00:31:18.761 --> 00:31:22.210
like some parks spot and they were filming these things flying through the air

495
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.730
and like,
you know,
you never seen anything move like this.
And I'm like,

496
00:31:24.731 --> 00:31:27.430
well that's probably because there's no people in it.
It's probably like drone.

497
00:31:27.431 --> 00:31:31.480
They're probably all drones.
Exactly like this,
but small.
Yeah,
exactly.

498
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:35.470
Be blackbirds.
Yeah.
Well,
you know what I mean?
We know that they have them now.

499
00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.000
We know that they have them.

500
00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.900
So if that's what they saw in 1996 and shit when people were filming,

501
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.140
that's probably the answer to a lot of this UFO bullshit.

502
00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:49.330
<v 3>Well,
I don't believe in Ufos.
I don't,
I think the type traveled is,
is a closer,</v>

503
00:31:49.331 --> 00:31:53.730
uh,
thing in the distance or they're creating some kind of wearable,

504
00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.950
but that'll don't believe in aliens.
I don't think,
I think that they exist.

505
00:31:56.951 --> 00:31:58.300
I just don't think they've ever been here.

506
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.020
<v 5>I'm not convinced that they have or haven't.
I could,</v>

507
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.340
I could see it argued either way.

508
00:32:02.341 --> 00:32:06.210
It sounds totally preposterous when you watch like those ancient aliens shows,

509
00:32:06.211 --> 00:32:10.050
when you see that guy with the crazy hair,
I'm talking all this nonsense about,

510
00:32:10.051 --> 00:32:11.880
you know,
how they believe that.
Well,
you know,

511
00:32:11.881 --> 00:32:15.300
aliens taught all these different people,
all these different things.

512
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.270
But you know,
look,
if we are people,

513
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:23.070
okay and we have aspired to travel and we supposedly had been to the moon,

514
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:26.460
if we have that sort of capability in our primitive stage of development,

515
00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.010
whatever,
there's a culture,
a hundred thousand 200,000,

516
00:32:29.011 --> 00:32:32.710
300,000 years older than us,
that's nothing in the limit of time.
That's nothing.

517
00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.270
So culture that survives by the media culture that survives,

518
00:32:36.271 --> 00:32:40.130
it's two or 3 million years older than us.
They're going to so fucking

519
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:45.130
<v 2>far ahead of us that they would literally be able to bypass all the ideas or,</v>

520
00:32:46.371 --> 00:32:50.930
or have come to a resolution on all the ideas about interrupting life and

521
00:32:50.931 --> 00:32:53.960
genetically engineering new life.
To them it would be like,
yeah,

522
00:32:53.961 --> 00:32:56.540
of course you do it.
This is what you do.
You just make your lives.
Yeah,

523
00:32:56.541 --> 00:33:00.380
we'd go there and we introduced our genetics into these monkey genetics and

524
00:33:00.381 --> 00:33:04.340
these monkeys have this crazy thing happens where their brain doubles over a

525
00:33:04.341 --> 00:33:08.690
period of 2 million years and they become humans.
Did that happen?
I don't know.

526
00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:10.630
But there's a lot of fucking stories,
a law,

527
00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.390
all of these different stories from so many different religions and so many

528
00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:19.010
different ancient texts all have to do with some higher being coming from the

529
00:33:19.011 --> 00:33:21.230
sky.
You mean what the fuck man?

530
00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.110
A little bit though that people would just want to believe in something.

531
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.610
Maybe it's possible.
I mean humans,
I mean it's not an either or,

532
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.040
you know what I'm saying?
It's not an either or.
We don't souls.

533
00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:36.580
You're a survivor at this point that you come from a long line assholes.

534
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.380
You know,
we were the guys who ate the last bit of food.

535
00:33:39.381 --> 00:33:42.840
We were the ones that didn't share during famine,
you know,

536
00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:47.860
and that easy.
I know what you're saying,
but not really.
You know,

537
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.420
all you have to do is get a group of cool people together to fight off the

538
00:33:50.421 --> 00:33:53.450
assholes and you survive as well.
You don't have to be an asshole to survive.

539
00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.640
It can be the cool,
smart people that get together and fight off the acid.

540
00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:59.690
So just because we're here doesn't mean where the children of assholes.

541
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:04.610
But it ain't crazy.
Every,
I mean like every just barbaric.
I mean,

542
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.960
well you know,

543
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:10.070
from the fucking Mayans to fuck everybody in Europe,

544
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.890
the different clans,
you know,
they were just barbarians.

545
00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:16.880
I mean just the fucking hunts that you know,
we like one when is,

546
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:21.900
it's six people have the same DNA as gang is Kong or some shit cause he was

547
00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:23.843
calm.

548
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:28.820
He comes out of the steps of Mongolia and the fucking sweeps in and takes almost

549
00:34:28.821 --> 00:34:31.580
the whole world in that fucking amazing.

550
00:34:31.581 --> 00:34:35.380
I mean grasp it was fucking gangster.

551
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:39.440
Wouldn't it be awesome to be able to get real documentary footage?

552
00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:44.180
Like the coolest fucking thing would be,
you can't travel through time,

553
00:34:44.181 --> 00:34:48.590
but what you can do is go back in time and watch it and record it.
Well,
you know,

554
00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.590
if you imagine on a way to extract it from trees,

555
00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.530
thousand year old tree would see what scene.
Technically in a sense,

556
00:34:57.531 --> 00:35:02.060
we're just reflecting light and that's all our OER.
Okay.
And light travels at,

557
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:04.430
this is the ultimate stoner talk right here.

558
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:10.580
Why were you in Guam by the way?
Like,

559
00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:14.890
it's like it's been bothered for,
fuck,

560
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:18.800
I forgot that we were talking about that.
I was just talking about this.

561
00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:21.130
I love this,
this shit man.

562
00:35:21.131 --> 00:35:24.860
I ain't getting high and fucking talking about what I'm talking about.
Hold on,

563
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.320
let me finish the point.
And then if I could tell you about was dude,

564
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:28.723
check it out.

565
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:33.790
That if you could go fast than the speed of light to the time and then with the

566
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:36.140
powerful enough,
uh,

567
00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.680
telescope pointed at us to catch the light reflected.
Okay.

568
00:35:40.681 --> 00:35:44.820
You could use just as satellite technology looks down on the earth,

569
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:50.160
you could see the reflection of the earth from that time and visually prove

570
00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:52.080
everything you wanted to.
Well,

571
00:35:52.081 --> 00:35:56.040
what if you went faster out in the space?
Okay,

572
00:35:56.041 --> 00:35:59.250
you go faster on the space and then you had of lattice scope.

573
00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:03.060
You have a telescope that could look back and capture the light that's coming

574
00:36:03.061 --> 00:36:05.670
off the earth delight that's coming from the earth as you go.

575
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.750
You would theoretically be looking at earth at that point,

576
00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.460
the reflection of the light.

577
00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.120
So you could see looking at earth at that point in time.

578
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.590
So at the speed of light,

579
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:21.090
Earth's history would come at you or me if you could visually swatch it.

580
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.480
Who are the clothes that you would be a thousand years in the future looking at

581
00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:27.550
thousand years in the past.
So you'd really more than a thousand moment,

582
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.400
theoretically it would still freeze.

583
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:33.380
It would still be the exact same distance between earth and you at all points.

584
00:36:33.381 --> 00:36:37.550
So those are the same,
but that that doesn't matter.
It's the no,
it's the,

585
00:36:37.551 --> 00:36:39.600
the backyards that light,

586
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.840
that light reflects off of it.

587
00:36:42.841 --> 00:36:46.570
So you could catch an image of what it might not be a perfect image.
Right.

588
00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.530
So as you're going 10 million miles an hour,

589
00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:54.060
it's as it's a million miles away.
Yeah.
It,
no,
no,
no.

590
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:58.270
If you light the light,
the light,
there's a guy,

591
00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:03.150
I know what you're saying with the idea behind it is if you move into the future

592
00:37:03.151 --> 00:37:06.990
faster than the speed of light,
what happens back here moves at a much,
much,

593
00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:10.470
much faster pace.
No,
no.
What I'm saying is,

594
00:37:10.471 --> 00:37:13.980
is that that the light that bounces off the earth,
okay.

595
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.320
Has an image and that image is the same.

596
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:18.870
I'm traveling off the earth at the speed of light.

597
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:23.160
If you go out into space and faster than the speed of light.

598
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.830
So you can't you Mac before it.
Yeah,

599
00:37:25.831 --> 00:37:30.540
you can look back at the image of the earth with a powerful enough telescope.

600
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.980
All right.
And see the history of earth come forward.
Whoa.
Okay.

601
00:37:34.981 --> 00:37:39.981
So you're saying that if you go forward like some fucking insane like if you

602
00:37:42.631 --> 00:37:45.880
went faster than light Alpha Centauri,
what's bad for you?
See the earth,

603
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.690
if we have the kind of technologies that will allow you to,

604
00:37:48.691 --> 00:37:51.150
even though your billions of light years away or however far,

605
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.650
the farther away you are to look back and see the earth and get close to the

606
00:37:55.651 --> 00:37:59.940
actually to the ground so you can even from a hundred million light years away

607
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.150
you still have full view of the earth.
It wouldn't be full.
It would be obscured.

608
00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:04.591
There would be,

609
00:38:04.591 --> 00:38:08.340
you know there's dark patches and only the light that bounces off as the sunny

610
00:38:08.341 --> 00:38:10.710
side.
You can see the sunny side of the earth.
Yes.

611
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.880
You couldn't catch anybody cause people do fucked up shit at night.

612
00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:20.430
You'd be doing the real fucked up shit.
You Ain't get nothing.

613
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.660
No proof on me,
mother fucker.
You could say you saw a shadow in the window,

614
00:38:24.661 --> 00:38:28.350
but she don't know nothing.
Fuck you.
That's saying I'm not going for court.

615
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:32.090
All right.
I'm just saying.
I see what you're saying though.
It's trippy.

616
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.500
Total stoner thought right there should be taught what should be talking about.

617
00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:36.070
The idea of

618
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.900
<v 5>time itself is very trippy and especially because it's limited,
you know,
limited.</v>

619
00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:43.420
We are,
our physical bodies find it limited,

620
00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:46.810
but when you get past our physical bodies and all other physical bodies,

621
00:38:46.811 --> 00:38:51.730
that time is just sort of fly.
It's one thing,
just one big gigantic moment,

622
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:56.530
which is we don't,
last time's only important to us.
That's the real mind.
Fuck.

623
00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:01.150
That's Daddy's.
Exactly it.
The real mind fuck is.
Then you're dying.

624
00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.430
Soon as you're born,
you're dying.
When it to,

625
00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.600
I watched a fucking guy get killed by a bear today.
Somebody put it up,

626
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:12.270
broken board.
It was a train.
It was a train bear.
And,
uh,

627
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.000
the train bear had been in movies before,
man and the,
the fucking guy,

628
00:39:16.001 --> 00:39:18.700
he's a gentleman and this bear in the,

629
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.180
in this pan and they're trained in it and doing things with it age just turns on

630
00:39:22.181 --> 00:39:26.930
this guy out of nowhere and rips his throat apart and just tears at it and shit.

631
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:30.050
<v 1>Yeah.
That's why I never want to go up in this space and look at the future.</v>

632
00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.580
The past dozen years,
fuckings bears up there.

633
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:38.330
Just the promos for that shit,
undiscovered discovery or whatever it is,

634
00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.270
and that makes his fishing nace to grizzly bears.

635
00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:44.750
And I just went the grizzly bear to go,
fuck you.
I'm you and you.
I got you.

636
00:39:44.751 --> 00:39:47.900
And even during the Grizzly man movie,
all right,
it's your ass.

637
00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:52.300
I'm coming and does attack the fucking boat and very frightening there.

638
00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.160
Fucking,
they are powerful animals,
man.

639
00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.830
They go rip all horse his fucking head off.

640
00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.530
<v 5>Paul.
I've talked about it too much over the past few weeks and I talked about it</v>

641
00:40:01.531 --> 00:40:05.280
yesterday on the Tom Green podcasts,
but there's a video you should see folks.

642
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.610
It's a bear eating a moose alive and it's on the Internet.

643
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.010
You want to know how ruthless fucking nature is,
man.

644
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.350
They're fucking broke it all down and kill you man.
They just start eating.
Yeah,

645
00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:18.960
and we'll get down on the eat you while you're still playing Jack.

646
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:22.800
Kill me.
Fires this video though.
The crazy thing is,
is a trained bear.

647
00:40:22.801 --> 00:40:25.950
This guy had raised this pair and trained it and his,
his,

648
00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:28.940
I believe it was his cousin was in the rink with it.
You know,

649
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.740
as they were working with the bear and the bear just for whatever reason,

650
00:40:31.741 --> 00:40:36.630
just decided to attack him outta nowhere.
Unprovoked.
Just fucked him up,
man.

651
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:40.770
You think so?
Really?
Why are you fucking with a bear?
It's a bear.

652
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:44.300
It's just to make some money.
That's what he does.
Fire trainer.

653
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:47.190
But somebody has got to do,

654
00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:50.040
like if you've got to have a movie where you have a guy wrestle a bear,

655
00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:54.260
someone's got to train that fucking pair.
We can't have a moving CGN.
Yeah.

656
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.590
You ever see that movie Congo?
Yes.

657
00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:02.280
When they had those big crazy monkeys that were so obviously man with monkey

658
00:41:02.281 --> 00:41:05.850
suits.
It was annoying.
Man.
Gai is fixed.
All of it.

659
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.810
<v 1>It wasn't working then.
Oh,</v>

660
00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:16.270
that's my favorite earthquake joke.
How dare you brown you Neil earthquake,

661
00:41:16.271 --> 00:41:17.710
the convenient and quick,
what did he say?

662
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:22.900
He said that he went on a edition and so for planet of the apes to tell Michael

663
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.840
Clarke Duncan in there,
and he called his agent just left.

664
00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:28.570
He said that what the fuck it didn't need makeup

665
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.370
<v 5>is,
is there</v>

666
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.420
<v 2>even in Guam,
there's earthquake trying to get back to the garage.</v>

667
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:42.950
Do you know they're protected by the Mariana Church?

668
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.500
The lowest place on their protected by it.
Yeah.

669
00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:50.480
He protected by the lowest spot on her.
Um,
the,
uh,
the immense cavern,
uh,

670
00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:53.960
takes out a lot of the energy from the tsunami.
The how deep the water gets.

671
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.830
Really?
Yeah.

672
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:59.650
So they are protected by a reef and the predicted protected by the Mariana

673
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.840
showed them had been jacked by a tsunami.
No,
they come,

674
00:42:02.841 --> 00:42:05.780
but they don't get the full width and breadth of it.
You know,

675
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:10.220
a lot of the energy is lost in the canyon is that trench where they recorded

676
00:42:10.221 --> 00:42:14.060
that insane biological sound.
I know there's the called the bloop.

677
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:19.220
There's one crazy sound that they recorded that so many times louder than

678
00:42:19.221 --> 00:42:23.040
anything they'd ever recorded that was biological under the water and they know

679
00:42:23.041 --> 00:42:26.950
it was biological.
I don't know what it was.
It's like mayhem under all day,

680
00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:31.160
man.
That guy is,
he's a little much right baby.

681
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:38.060
I love that guy.
I met him at this a serious spectrum.

682
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:42.330
That guy is a killer and look in his eyes and I'm like,
yeah,
that's a good,

683
00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:46.110
I had a lot of love to hurt me.
Well,

684
00:42:46.111 --> 00:42:48.470
like it'd be just a goat choice fighting.
Yeah.

685
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.360
Who enjoys it and he's fucking good at it.

686
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.820
He likes it and that's what he's supposed to be doing.
Yeah.

687
00:42:52.821 --> 00:42:56.240
There's a broad spectrum of human beings.
Yeah,
man,
I totally agree.

688
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.100
Everybody's supposed to be doing their thing.
You know,

689
00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.920
times people find their thing and it matches up with their personality and

690
00:43:00.921 --> 00:43:01.480
sometimes it's,

691
00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.030
<v 1>if I didn't mention,
if he didn't get into,</v>

692
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:06.940
can you imagine if he didn't get into fighting and instead he was like,
ah,

693
00:43:06.941 --> 00:43:11.020
I'm just going to work at toys r us and like you're just like,
Oh God,
I'm sorry.

694
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.670
Welcome fallen day waiting to happen.

695
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.130
That would be a problem one day waiting to happen.

696
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:17.260
<v 2>Yeah,
that would be a fucking problem.</v>

697
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:20.750
<v 1>Like I'm always nervous about any bravo late at night.</v>

698
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:24.470
Why have you seen him drunk?
I've seen him drunk.

699
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:28.400
And just the idea that you,

700
00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.920
anytime he wants it is very scary.

701
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:33.530
And the fact that there was nothing I could do and,

702
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:37.130
and then he tells guys that are like double this size,

703
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:42.070
how he'd choke them out from underneath.
Okay.
And I've never been heard.

704
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:46.040
I never even heard that.
I didn't know what that was.
And he's laughing about it.

705
00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:47.330
Oh yeah I do.

706
00:43:47.331 --> 00:43:51.980
I'd climb up on guy and then like fucking leg lock came and choke him out and

707
00:43:51.981 --> 00:43:53.120
shit like this.
And I'm like,

708
00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:56.300
it's so weird cause I don't get that from Eddie Bauer as well as I do with

709
00:43:56.301 --> 00:44:00.650
mayhem.
Like with Manheim,
I fear,
what am Eddie,
he's always just so happy and nice

710
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:03.540
competing.

711
00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.850
<v 2>Yeah.
You know the differences.</v>

712
00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:08.700
The guys that are competing guys are like actively fighting and MMA.

713
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:10.620
They all are super,

714
00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:15.060
they have to always be ready to train and to spar.

715
00:44:15.061 --> 00:44:17.570
And the orange thinking about competition,
they're always training.

716
00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:20.970
They're always ramped up,
you know?
And most of them were really calm,

717
00:44:20.971 --> 00:44:24.820
like may Hamm's is about as exaggerated a personalities.
Exactly.

718
00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.910
But that's just who he is.
He's always been like that.

719
00:44:26.911 --> 00:44:29.940
I've known that dude forever.
Well you have to,
he's always been like that.

720
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:34.500
But just the,
that they're in competition mode.
That's like some primal shit.

721
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:38.390
You're at nine all the time.
You know your,
your senses are heightened,
you know,

722
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.520
you're training for combat,
man.
That's like some serious shit.

723
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.040
[inaudible] imagine that every day.
Like from like,

724
00:44:45.041 --> 00:44:47.370
from like the Spartans,
how they,
you know,

725
00:44:47.371 --> 00:44:52.270
they'd get their kids kidnapped and taken and beaten and fucking tough up and

726
00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.210
toughened up.
You know,
you know,
and then they,

727
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:59.690
they escape at 18 and they go rape and steal a girl out at night.

728
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:03.720
You know,
it was part of was fucking,
I mean,
these guys,
they were warriors.

729
00:45:03.721 --> 00:45:07.410
It's crazy when you think about what pussies we are today and that people had to

730
00:45:07.411 --> 00:45:09.720
be like that at one point in time for us to get till today.

731
00:45:09.721 --> 00:45:10.830
They had to be strong.

732
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:15.810
They had to be able to fight off fucking animals and hordes of invading tribes.

733
00:45:15.811 --> 00:45:19.620
You how to be strong,
to stay alive just a few thousand years ago.
Crazy isn't it?

734
00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.330
It's,
it's strange.

735
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:26.160
Hundred 5,050 fucking year,
two lifetimes.

736
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:30.710
Do the wild west.
That was the 18 hundreds.
Yeah.
Matt.
Yeah.

737
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:35.510
18.
Great.
65 was the abolition of slavery,
right?
Was it 1875 or 1865.

738
00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.620
65.
And then you've got,
you know,

739
00:45:37.621 --> 00:45:41.760
fucking cowboys and Indians going to war war,

740
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:46.290
just fucking knife fighters.
Well,
those guys are nasty.

741
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:50.670
Did you see the thing we're,
we're,
um,
Obama got in trouble because he,
uh,
was,
uh,

742
00:45:50.671 --> 00:45:54.960
talking about sitting bull and recognizing the sitting bull was a hero and you

743
00:45:54.961 --> 00:45:58.590
know,
that it was like,
Eh,
I guess it was a part of some book that he has.

744
00:45:58.591 --> 00:46:01.650
He has some child book and uh,
people are going,
hey,

745
00:46:01.651 --> 00:46:05.610
sitting bowl like killed like a lot of fucking Americans.
Yeah.

746
00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:09.990
It's funny because we're acknowledging now that we've integrated the American

747
00:46:09.991 --> 00:46:13.650
Indian into the whole American culture,
like they are part of us now.

748
00:46:13.651 --> 00:46:18.540
We're sort of acknowledging that the original Americans just fuck them,
you know?

749
00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:22.140
And there's this guy fought back and this guy's a hero for fighting essentially

750
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:25.980
us.
Well,
you know,
it's mind boggling when when you say,
you know,
we're,

751
00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:30.900
we're the land of the free because of an act of terrorism to Willie Nelson.

752
00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:35.450
He's in fucking going to be in jail,
my deck.
But you know,

753
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.950
we say that,
you know,
we,
we,
we,
we,
we,
you know,

754
00:46:37.951 --> 00:46:42.660
we espouse this patriotism and stuff and,
and if you go to the Boston tea party,

755
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:43.703
which is fucking,

756
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:48.710
which is dumb dumbs Republicans that are mad that we have a black guy or saying,

757
00:46:48.901 --> 00:46:50.310
you know,
were tea party is okay,

758
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:54.210
they're fucking kind of talking about a terrorist act.

759
00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:58.770
That was a terrorist act.
It was not an act of war.
You know that,
right?

760
00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.340
We call it rebellion because we're all in this fucking side of it.

761
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:07.040
But it was a book and basically a terrorist act if an,
if,

762
00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.710
if white guys today dressed up as,

763
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:12.690
as that Arabs,
okay.

764
00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.140
And attacked a private company and destroyed property,

765
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:20.340
we'd call it a terrorist act.
Okay.
All right.

766
00:47:20.341 --> 00:47:23.540
And that's exactly what we did.
Right?
Okay.
It's tariffs act.
Yeah,
I know.

767
00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:27.930
And that's how we bought our nation.
And the same thing that,
you know,

768
00:47:27.931 --> 00:47:32.200
we accused Afghanistan being terrorist because they want to kill us or they

769
00:47:32.201 --> 00:47:35.650
killed this many,
and they don't want to be under our fucking rule out there.

770
00:47:35.651 --> 00:47:39.130
We'd be an empire like the fucking British where to us?
Well,

771
00:47:39.131 --> 00:47:42.190
we're a lot crazier than that.
We're more crazy than any empire ever.

772
00:47:42.191 --> 00:47:44.410
We have military presence in over a hundred countries.

773
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.550
Do you know what that means yet?

774
00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.590
We've got guns all over the world and jets and some American soldiers ready to

775
00:47:50.591 --> 00:47:54.010
go at anytime.
What's up,
dude?
It's ready to go.

776
00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:57.970
Strategically placed and all sorts of areas of it can get jets to them in time.

777
00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:02.410
Are you nervous about this fucking North Korea guy?
No.
No,
not at all.
No.

778
00:48:02.411 --> 00:48:05.360
I think he just wants better trade agreements.
That's not going to die.

779
00:48:05.361 --> 00:48:08.680
They don't have any food.
He's about to die.
He's already named on the same,

780
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:10.780
nothing's going to happen.
But look how,
look at his son now.

781
00:48:10.781 --> 00:48:12.460
His son's ready to jump in,
but,

782
00:48:12.461 --> 00:48:15.920
and he looks like he's a nice young guy that played starcraft and he's going to

783
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:20.560
finally dad's gone.
I could play starcraft with all my friends.

784
00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:25.750
Play Star craft.
I mean he's not as fun.
Once you have nuclear weapons,

785
00:48:25.751 --> 00:48:30.160
you can use telling you,
man,
it was like a bomb the fuck out of that island.

786
00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:32.980
They attacked an island,
right?

787
00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:37.600
They shelled the shit out of the four hours.
They flattened it.
Really?

788
00:48:37.601 --> 00:48:41.660
And what was on the island?
Who was on the island?
They kill people.
Yes.

789
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:45.290
They killed thousands,
supposedly.
Really?
It was like

790
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:50.110
you heard it was seven thought,
seven people to induces a retard.

791
00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:55.660
We should go Google.
Yeah.
Uh,

792
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:59.020
South Korean sailors,
they down to fucking ship.
And he said,

793
00:48:59.021 --> 00:49:00.850
and then they said they didn't motherfucker,

794
00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:05.940
we got you on tape when they fucking blew up a battleship and not about a ship.

795
00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:13.300
It's like a trawler,
uh,
of the South Korea navy.

796
00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:18.580
They blew it up and killed 47 sailors.
That's an act of war.

797
00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:22.510
Two dudes died.
Two dudes on the shell and they both died of aids.

798
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:30.610
They both had to hit
to our conversation.
And this is numbers.

799
00:49:30.611 --> 00:49:33.430
I think we need to leave out numbers until we know these bitches.

800
00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.470
It's two people died,
Bro.

801
00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:41.000
To dose those humans does humans and the shelling.
That's it.

802
00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:45.700
Oh my God.
Well,
what about the 47 sales?
That's still people that fucking died,

803
00:49:45.701 --> 00:49:49.680
man.
Praise crazy.
That guy's killing people.
Yeah,

804
00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:54.070
he's killing people and there,
yeah,
it looks like the Berlin checked.
Well,

805
00:49:54.071 --> 00:49:55.960
maybe you're right.
Maybe he's so fucked up.

806
00:49:55.961 --> 00:50:00.130
He is going to try to actually go out with a bang.
You never know.
You never know,

807
00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:04.810
man.
Don't underestimate cookoo.
You've gotta be pretty crazy to want to be,
uh,

808
00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.240
some sort of a leader like that.
A leader of a country.

809
00:50:07.241 --> 00:50:10.900
We didn't ever call lear of anything to be that arrogant that you should be the

810
00:50:10.901 --> 00:50:14.760
main person.
It's mean,
it's really just playing up on a flaw in human nature,

811
00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:16.550
law law as the,

812
00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:20.740
the necessity of the Alpha where we're always looking to the one person that we,

813
00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:22.750
we are going to be led by.

814
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:27.380
That's how all tribes of animals deal with tribes of wolves.
Do it tribes,

815
00:50:27.381 --> 00:50:30.760
a monkeys do it and tribes of humans to it.
We need one person.

816
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:32.150
Even though one person isn't qualified,

817
00:50:32.151 --> 00:50:34.040
as long as there's one person in that position.

818
00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:37.190
That's why you know the cell Sarah Palin thing is possible.

819
00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:40.310
You don't have to be qualified.
You just have to be in the position.

820
00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:44.090
You know this.
This fucking guy isn't qualified to be the president North Korea.

821
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.280
You're telling me other than North Korean people haven't said,
listen,

822
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:49.040
I'm a lot more reasonable.
I could get shit done with other countries

823
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:54.650
like that as a cabbage in every pot and the ground chicken in every pot.

824
00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:58.423
Yeah,
you gotta be,

825
00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:02.000
you gotta be really twisted motherfucker to want to run things.

826
00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:06.170
Fucking rockets that hit off the shore of Hawaii.

827
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:13.070
Hawaii.
Wow.
You've got enough fuck up.
Why I Hawaii is awesome.

828
00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:18.290
I was there after Guam to fuck up Hawaii.
Well,

829
00:51:18.291 --> 00:51:21.620
what if they fuck up?
If they're willing to fuck up these people on this island,

830
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:21.831
man,

831
00:51:21.831 --> 00:51:25.910
let me tell you what the fact there's over a million infantry of North Korea.

832
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.340
That's what people do there.
They don't make anything.

833
00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:31.550
Everybody is fucking in the army.
It's true.
All right.

834
00:51:31.551 --> 00:51:33.980
If they wanted to walk over South Korea,

835
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:39.010
there's nothing we could do with 28,500 US troops right there except for

836
00:51:39.471 --> 00:51:41.810
battlefield nukes to prevent it.

837
00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:46.640
Do you understand the complete wipe out and within hours they could take soul.

838
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:51.200
All of it be gone.
All of it.
Really.

839
00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:55.880
How much w w how many troops does and the United States have their 28,500 I

840
00:51:55.881 --> 00:51:59.150
think that's plenty.
It's not put the shit we got sun.
Well yeah.

841
00:51:59.151 --> 00:52:01.340
Well that's what I'm saying.
Cause that battlefield nukes,

842
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:03.470
there's no way to do it.
They got jets.

843
00:52:03.471 --> 00:52:07.160
Don't they have like Janssen fucking do they have jets?

844
00:52:07.161 --> 00:52:10.580
They're all the same shit.
Whether they get Soviet shit.
Yeah and Chinese shit.

845
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:14.750
Tiny shit.
Mother fuckers,
man man,

846
00:52:14.751 --> 00:52:15.860
they fucking be Nike's.

847
00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:20.430
Let me tell you what they can fuck up a jet that would make a fast Mig.
Yeah,

848
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:23.650
and they got a lot of them and they got a shit load of numbers to,

849
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.140
that's the real of sheer numbers.
You couldn't stop.
That.

850
00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:30.920
Real crazy thing is China and if you really wanted to have a country,
if we are,

851
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:35.900
we're in a situation like we used to have like with the United States versus

852
00:52:35.901 --> 00:52:36.470
Russia.

853
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:40.760
When I was a kid it was always everyone was worried that Russia was going to the

854
00:52:40.761 --> 00:52:45.520
United States.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Red Dog and pony boy motherfuckers.

855
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:46.400
Yeah,
there was,

856
00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.670
everybody was concerned that something we were going to eventually get involved

857
00:52:49.671 --> 00:52:51.770
in some sort of a nuclear exchange and you always heard,

858
00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:55.850
oh we almost came to a nuclear exchange was a mistake and we got out of it and

859
00:52:55.851 --> 00:52:58.640
luckily cooler heads prevail.
We play again,

860
00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:03.920
plane and shit.
That was just,

861
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:07.340
I mean that was just a little while ago man.
We kind of forgot what that's like.

862
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:11.020
But China,
he's in the position to be that again.
Yeah.

863
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:15.410
They are ruthless people.
They are ruthless,
ruthless and there's so many of them.

864
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.350
They look,
if you want some of the HBO show for,

865
00:53:18.351 --> 00:53:20.650
I think some of the shit that's going down in China right now.
You know,

866
00:53:20.651 --> 00:53:24.830
it's a really popular,
what's happening a lot.
People selling their kids.
Yeah.

867
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:27.180
People are having their kids and it's selling them and they,

868
00:53:27.181 --> 00:53:30.660
they're like five and six years old.
So hot right now.

869
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:33.150
Shelly is cooperation.
Horrifying man.

870
00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.250
There was a whole show on it where this brother,

871
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.400
his brother was five and his brother was kidnapped and they kidnapped his

872
00:53:38.401 --> 00:53:40.980
brother instead of him because he was eight and he would've known how to get

873
00:53:40.981 --> 00:53:44.970
home.
So they kidnap this fucking five year old and took him away and he sold it.

874
00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:47.040
His father sold it and his father's talking about him.

875
00:53:47.041 --> 00:53:50.190
He had to sell one of his sons and he didn't want to,
but he had to do it.

876
00:53:50.191 --> 00:53:52.850
So we went with the younger one because he didn't,
uh,

877
00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:56.130
he didn't know any better and he could trick them or something along those
lines.

878
00:53:56.131 --> 00:53:59.600
But you know,
he's talking about how the,
he was really upset that the,
uh,
the,

879
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:02.070
the older boy was a,
was still mad at him about it,

880
00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.890
but these kids are probably the kids that are smoking cigarettes where you see

881
00:54:04.891 --> 00:54:07.500
on like the youtube videos and stuff.
You're like,
yeah,
this guy's a dick.

882
00:54:07.501 --> 00:54:09.670
I would sell them for $5.
He's,
you know,
self,

883
00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.230
a note and all my cigarettes out at all.
And a little boy,
man,

884
00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:18.070
the little boy whose his brother was left behind.
It was really heartbreaking.

885
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:20.820
It's talking about missing his brother and how his brother,

886
00:54:20.821 --> 00:54:24.360
and he was so mad at his father that his,
you know,
his father sold his brother.

887
00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:26.880
I was like,
you gotta be fucking shitting me man.
It all the time.

888
00:54:26.881 --> 00:54:28.540
It's wearing him to corporations.

889
00:54:28.541 --> 00:54:32.430
These weren't dirty clothes and he's in his fucking shack,
you know,

890
00:54:32.431 --> 00:54:35.670
this little shack with his dad and his dad is trying to explain how he needed

891
00:54:35.671 --> 00:54:39.860
the money.
I'm like,
it's like,
it's like,
um,
you know,

892
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:44.070
the only way to citizenship basically like enrollment times is to be in the
army,

893
00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:49.410
you know,
to go from poverty to grace and stuff is to aid,
have intellect.
Okay.

894
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:50.910
I show,
you know,

895
00:54:50.911 --> 00:54:55.650
and an aptitude for military service or science or math or you know,

896
00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:59.970
athletics or you go to the fucking drones in Japan,
China.

897
00:54:59.971 --> 00:55:02.610
I mean in China you have to be,

898
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:05.310
you saw everybody joins the military and trying to,
yeah,

899
00:55:05.311 --> 00:55:09.510
it's got a huge fucking military.
Tiggers or military.
I want to hear a number.

900
00:55:09.511 --> 00:55:10.680
I know you got one in your head come up.

901
00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:15.510
It's so supposedly the third largest overall,

902
00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.900
their largest incorporate it to power strength,

903
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:20.580
my own power rating as number three,

904
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:24.700
but on sheer numbers if they want it to because they have like the national guys

905
00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:28.380
that were there and people are,
you know that that aren't in certain areas.

906
00:55:28.381 --> 00:55:30.900
They're like the national guard.
Even though they might work at a factory.

907
00:55:30.901 --> 00:55:34.740
Also if you,
you know,
enlist those militia.

908
00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:39.300
It's the largest army in the world by number.
Wow.
That's crazy.

909
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:44.190
Way By number and then,
but by power it's only number two.

910
00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:47.790
It's a whole interesting the life that they have their man,
you know this,

911
00:55:47.791 --> 00:55:51.060
all the shit that's going down with these companies that have people working

912
00:55:51.061 --> 00:55:54.030
insane hours and people are jumping off buildings and shit.
Like just wait.

913
00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:55.530
The whole con comm thing.

914
00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:58.260
I read something that was kind of an interesting rebuttal to that con comm

915
00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:00.770
because it talked about all the suicides and con comm habit.

916
00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:05.130
Then it mode noted that con comm has over 500,000 employees.

917
00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:08.190
So is that an above average?
It's not really.

918
00:56:08.191 --> 00:56:11.930
It's not as compared to the population.
No,
it's not.
And you know,
yeah,
they're,

919
00:56:11.931 --> 00:56:14.720
they're working shitty jobs,
man.
Those jobs suck.

920
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:18.050
They just suck and you're going to work in a factory assembly line.
Yeah.

921
00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:21.030
Guess what?
It's not going to be a,
it goes into the hall.
You know why?

922
00:56:21.031 --> 00:56:23.920
Because Walmart wants to save 17 cents per.

923
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:26.380
<v 5>Yeah.
I wouldn't start selling kids.
I'm like,</v>

924
00:56:26.381 --> 00:56:29.890
I could get like $10,000 selling my kids.
I'll just have a baby factory.

925
00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:30.920
I don't think they're that much.

926
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:35.040
They're not even that much bigger grant and got way better than that.

927
00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:38.200
What does that make six months of work though at one of those iPod factories

928
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:41.610
that by the time you're done crying,
that's right.
When your money,
right.

929
00:56:41.611 --> 00:56:44.350
It's got to turn it off.
You've got to turn it off.
You got to turn it off.

930
00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:45.270
It's your kid.
Yeah.

931
00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:50.470
Good luck with that haunted dreams for the rest of your fucking life,

932
00:56:50.471 --> 00:56:55.330
man.
You just sold your son haunted dreams that just goes to show you that man,

933
00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:00.130
the apocalypse that sell me the apocalypse is everywhere.
It's just not here yet.

934
00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:01.870
The apocalypse is everywhere.

935
00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:05.890
There's different lives that are experiencing it all over the world in an

936
00:57:05.891 --> 00:57:09.670
individual basis with individual families and individual situations.

937
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:13.960
There's apocalypse is all over Africa,
all over parts of the world,

938
00:57:13.961 --> 00:57:17.050
all over the child will holocaust.
It's insane.

939
00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:19.150
The shit that's going down in Africa right now,

940
00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:22.920
if it was happening in your neighborhood,
you would be smarter,

941
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:24.160
follows the end of the world.

942
00:57:24.450 --> 00:57:27.310
You know what be cool is that run through with machetes and cut people's heads

943
00:57:27.311 --> 00:57:28.360
off and,
and yeah,

944
00:57:28.361 --> 00:57:31.930
there's a lot of hacking to death with machetes and going down kids and getting

945
00:57:31.931 --> 00:57:35.020
them to drug addicted and shooting cocaine and heroin.

946
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:39.130
America Americans says start franchising itself like as a brand name.
Like,
Hey,

947
00:57:39.131 --> 00:57:42.070
we're going to have an America opening up in your neighborhood and you can have

948
00:57:42.071 --> 00:57:44.380
our laws and rules and protection,
you know,

949
00:57:44.381 --> 00:57:46.720
but it's going to cost you money and it's going to start popping up like

950
00:57:46.721 --> 00:57:51.010
Starbucks.
Just like,
dude,
let's go to the American media in July.

951
00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:54.820
Just employer.
That's a great idea.
We just go to Africa and just jacket.
Yeah.

952
00:57:54.821 --> 00:57:59.410
And then it goes to jack did that Bro.
We did that a lot in Africa.

953
00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:03.820
Well they tried to,
what's going on right now is a,
there's so much war.

954
00:58:03.821 --> 00:58:08.560
Civil war in the Congo is a lot of like expensive shit in the concrete and

955
00:58:08.561 --> 00:58:11.560
stuff.
Yeah,
just found lithium there.

956
00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:15.720
So now there's the next gold rush.
The Congo's.
Uh,
that's

957
00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:22.840
so much rape and crime and scanning shapes.
New End workers,
man.

958
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:25.990
Like people who've worked for the UN or down,
they're raping and killing.

959
00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:30.700
That's why you need to go to America.
Yeah.
So do you think we can just take,

960
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:34.070
don't play any music bro.
That's where the food is.
No.

961
00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.700
Was we're going to go on Sirius.
So keep doing that.

962
00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:39.940
You're gonna fuck us up mass America.
Yeah,
but you don't know him that,

963
00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:45.550
do y'all know that song?
I'm friends with people that do
call Trey.

964
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.640
Don't say your friends unless you can call that dude right now and go,
Yo,

965
00:58:48.641 --> 00:58:52.360

He's not going to sue you.
You don't know that sir.

967
00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.830
You can't.
You get,
you got to get releases for shit.

968
00:58:57.870 --> 00:59:02.650
This is the Karaoke version too.
Oh,
now it makes it good.
What I was saying,

969
00:59:02.651 --> 00:59:06.370
tunes man,
you can't,
I couldn't even hum that song,
that door song in my,

970
00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.830
my a comedy central special.
I couldn't go.

971
00:59:08.831 --> 00:59:12.700
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo man couldn't do that.

972
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:16.210
You can't do that because someone owns that.
And you know what?

973
00:59:16.211 --> 00:59:21.211
No one gave me any shit when I sampled a Kung Fu fighting in my,

974
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:26.320
<v 2>uh,
second special.
You sampled it.
Do you mean you got on stage and sang it?
Yeah,</v>

975
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:28.340
I hummed it.
Hmm.
Well,

976
00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:31.420
Carl Douglas is,

977
00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:35.840
is there a time where music becomes everyone's property?

978
00:59:35.841 --> 00:59:39.200
Isn't there like some sort of a thing that happens with books and literature

979
00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:43.430
wherever they live become property?
Like what does the term I think it is,

980
00:59:43.431 --> 00:59:47.210
I think it's,
you know,
like you can't see you,
you know,
the Christmas songs,

981
00:59:47.211 --> 00:59:51.290
you know,
like anyone can sing a Christmas domain song,
public domains.

982
00:59:51.291 --> 00:59:53.600
That's exactly what the term is.
Public domain.
Yeah.

983
00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.940
Does that happen with with every song or I don't take certain socks.

984
00:59:56.941 --> 00:59:59.450
I mean it should really have to like a hundred years or something like that.

985
00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:04.250
Yeah,
I dunno.
I Dunno man.
You know it's,
it's,
you know,

986
01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.790
there's somebody who gets paid on happy birthday.
Yeah,
that's pretty nuts.

987
01:00:07.791 --> 01:00:09.950
Like when you go to Bennigan's,
I can't sing happy birthday,

988
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:13.490
so we have some version of it.

989
01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:18.350
The gross,
just do it and see if you get away with it.

990
01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:20.960
You know where they're going.
They're going to sue Bennigan's all over the world.

991
01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:25.790
They come at birth and that's just gross.
Whoever would do that,
man,

992
01:00:25.791 --> 01:00:27.040
what a piece of shit anymore.

993
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.410
You're calling him you and happy birthday just because you own that shit on

994
01:00:30.411 --> 01:00:33.500
paper as you mean your own happy birthday.
You fucking Weirdo.

995
01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:37.180
I know it to everybody's well,
we added Pat.

996
01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:40.030
How can you own that shit's been around forever.
Forever.

997
01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:44.480
There's someone actually write that.
Yeah.
Two people apparently I doubt it.

998
01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:49.340
That's what they say.
Hey,
let's get together and make a song together.

999
01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:53.060
Do Man,
they sit down and try to come up with a catchy lingo.

1000
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:58.730
People following you right now?
Uh,
W on what?
On,

1001
01:00:58.731 --> 01:01:01.950
on this stuff.
On Twitter gathers twitters.
Oh no shit.

1002
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:06.680
See that's why you need to get into Twitter cause he,
I mean it's,
it's like hey,

1003
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.680
I'm in Chicago right now.
What's the best place to eat?

1004
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:14.270
You'll get instant answers or what's the best place to work?
Can I get some weed?

1005
01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:18.290
You know,
instant answers answered those questions myself.

1006
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:21.500
It's like instant information now.
It's,
it's,

1007
01:01:21.501 --> 01:01:22.910
it's like can't you just did it yourself?

1008
01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:27.230
It's text messaging like 8,000 people at once or how many ever followers or you

1009
01:01:27.231 --> 01:01:31.460
are so you can send shit out.
That's amazing.
Yeah that's a lot of power.

1010
01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.840
It's interesting.
I mean cause you have,
you have the,

1011
01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:39.080
the combined knowledge of 8,000 possibly if they were all online at the same

1012
01:01:39.831 --> 01:01:42.530
time.
Well just one question.
So you have the population,

1013
01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.350
you definitely get good answers to a lot of shit.
And if you are,

1014
01:01:45.351 --> 01:01:49.040
if you're an interesting person and you went to things that you know fascinating

1015
01:01:49.041 --> 01:01:52.160
things about science and space and I know you are,
when you tweak those,

1016
01:01:52.161 --> 01:01:54.500
if you find something online and you find some story,
like,
wow,

1017
01:01:54.501 --> 01:01:58.130
check this shit out.
You know,
they just invented Bam and you put that link up,

1018
01:01:58.170 --> 01:01:59.090
you'll put that link up.

1019
01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:02.510
A bunch of dudes will retweet that link and then they'll start sending you shit,

1020
01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:04.970
Hey Ralphie,
I know you're into this space.
Shit,
check this out.

1021
01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:08.360
They just discovered this doom and that's what's going on in black about harp

1022
01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:11.660
shortly after the heart.
Yes.
That's fucking amazing.
What have you heard

1023
01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.210
that we are,
we're are secretly having a war at,

1024
01:02:17.211 --> 01:02:20.190
we are attacking,
uh,
Pakistan,

1025
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.510
<v 3>China,
India,
um,
uh,</v>

1026
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:28.620
Bangladesh and Indonesia,
that whole area or region,
uh,

1027
01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:32.430
through bending the ionosphere with massive radio waves.

1028
01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:36.060
So what do we do in Alaska?
We're causing flooding like,

1029
01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:40.490
like beyond a all time that's ever been recorded.
Um,

1030
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.500
concentration of earthquakes,
um,

1031
01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:47.460
that we were relieving the pressure that we're moving the ionosphere where,

1032
01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:50.700
where are you getting all this?
Are you sure?
Yeah.

1033
01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:55.440
H No,
I'm not sure.
That's what I'm saying.
I mean are you sure?

1034
01:02:55.441 --> 01:02:56.520
I know what you're saying.

1035
01:02:56.550 --> 01:03:00.030
I know that but I'm saying that the floods this year where the greatest of all

1036
01:03:00.031 --> 01:03:02.580
time that they have uh,
according to you as,

1037
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:07.710
as they have a higher rate of wearing a very high earthquake for a Asia Central

1038
01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.370
Asia and South Asia of all time.
Okay.

1039
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:17.690
<v 5>Yeah.
But Ralphie that easily could be because the cycles of the earth,</v>

1040
01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.210
that doesn't mean shit.
The,

1041
01:03:19.211 --> 01:03:24.211
that we have only done what we've studied as far as like earthquakes and floods

1042
01:03:25.131 --> 01:03:29.000
and you know the history of weather and disasters.
This is,

1043
01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:33.800
we're dealing with a tiny fraction of the time but the earth has existed.

1044
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:36.950
Our data is so small.
So when you say something like,

1045
01:03:36.951 --> 01:03:39.770
you know there's a record earthquakes,
there's record floods,

1046
01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:44.600
the record is like you just woke up and the phone rang and you like this phone

1047
01:03:44.601 --> 01:03:48.170
has rang a record number of times today cause it only rang once cause you've

1048
01:03:48.171 --> 01:03:49.660
only been awake for five minutes.
Our,

1049
01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:54.470
our knowledge of the earth is so fucking minuscule that anytime people get crazy

1050
01:03:54.471 --> 01:03:56.750
and start saying things like,
oh,
there's a record number of earthquakes,

1051
01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:01.190
it must be because someone's attacking Pakistan with a blight running bolt that

1052
01:04:01.191 --> 01:04:05.360
goes into the sky.
It's not necessarily the fact that sounds sexy as fuck.

1053
01:04:05.361 --> 01:04:09.110
That sounds sexy as fuck,
man.
I don't think it's that simple.

1054
01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:13.070
I don't think it's that simple.
I think who knows what,
it's a research project.

1055
01:04:13.071 --> 01:04:16.850
It's a high frequency active auroral research program.

1056
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:19.040
We don't know exactly what they're doing.

1057
01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:20.930
They could be doing a bunch of different things.

1058
01:04:20.931 --> 01:04:22.900
They could be trying to charge up the ionosphere,

1059
01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:26.150
but the idea that they're somehow the shooting something in the space and

1060
01:04:26.151 --> 01:04:27.800
attacking Pakistan,
dude,

1061
01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.230
someone's bullshitting you cause that is not what's happening.
Okay.

1062
01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.860
There's just no,
no evidence that points to that at all.
There's no,
no.

1063
01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.020
There's all these people that want everything to be sexy and they want

1064
01:04:39.021 --> 01:04:41.150
everything to be sexy.
They want everything to be,

1065
01:04:41.151 --> 01:04:43.190
the government's attacking us from space.

1066
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:45.230
They want everything to be a conspiracy.

1067
01:04:45.231 --> 01:04:48.920
And the problem with that kind of thinking is it fucks up the ones that are real

1068
01:04:48.921 --> 01:04:52.670
conspiracies.
Cause there's all lot of them.
There's plenty of real that's a real,

1069
01:04:52.671 --> 01:04:56.870
because it's a real place and is Dev,
they're definitely doing real research.

1070
01:04:56.871 --> 01:05:00.110
But I don't know.
I don't know what that is and I don't think you do either.

1071
01:05:00.111 --> 01:05:03.410
And I think until we do know,
you can't really say that.

1072
01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:07.340
You can't just go and say their attack in Pakistan with shit from the sky.
No,

1073
01:05:07.341 --> 01:05:10.670
but latest theory.
But by who?

1074
01:05:10.671 --> 01:05:14.760
Alex Jones is hap retarded,
illegitimate brother.
Woo.

1075
01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:18.610
<v 3>Uh,
I like,
uh,
Jesse Ventura,</v>

1076
01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:22.550
<v 2>but there's a lot of conspiracy should wish from me.</v>

1077
01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:30.100
They're in the shit,
ain't got time to listen to him too.

1078
01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:32.890
And I think he's another guy that's looking for things to be sexy.

1079
01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:37.060
He wants conspiracies.
There's plenty of God damn conspiracies that are real.

1080
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:40.900
But when you start looking for them in everything and saying that,
you know,

1081
01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:45.550
you think squirly man,
they're fucking went,
they honest,
fair,

1082
01:05:45.551 --> 01:05:46.720
and then bombarding it.
Sure.

1083
01:05:46.721 --> 01:05:49.670
But I don't know what they're doing or why they're doing it.
You know,

1084
01:05:49.671 --> 01:05:52.350
it could be some sort of weather experimentation.

1085
01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.400
It could be some sort of experimentation.

1086
01:05:54.401 --> 01:05:59.401
As far as recharging the magneto sphere or changing things or keeping the polls

1087
01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:03.340
right now,
what they're doing,
I don't know.

1088
01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.570
I don't have on crazy ram clue.
I know.

1089
01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:10.210
That's why I really want to know more about it.
There's a crazy one.

1090
01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:14.140
Was a operation starfish prime,
I believe that's what it's called.

1091
01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:18.010
They shot a nuke up into space and blew it up.
Yeah,

1092
01:06:18.011 --> 01:06:20.200
they loaded a name.
We're fucking danger.

1093
01:06:20.201 --> 01:06:22.870
They did in the fifties the Russians did it will.
The Americans did it.

1094
01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:26.950
We did move up.
We blew it up in inside the van Allen radiation belts,

1095
01:06:26.951 --> 01:06:28.690
like they were going to try to punch a hole through the man.

1096
01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.630
Allen everything up made it like way more radioactive.

1097
01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:34.180
The whole thing is a disaster up there.

1098
01:06:34.181 --> 01:06:37.510
It'd be like that for like a billion years and shit.
It's fucking done,

1099
01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:38.783
but it fucked that.

1100
01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:43.570
It stopped power in a New Zealand to Australia,
to La,

1101
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.530
Los Angeles.
It.

1102
01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:49.780
The impulse was so much more magnified because where it was,

1103
01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:52.810
it's really trippy when you go back in time and look at how many different

1104
01:06:52.811 --> 01:06:56.410
things that human beings did where they just took a chance.
Like,

1105
01:06:56.411 --> 01:06:59.230
let's see what happens when we just blow up a nuclear bomb and space.

1106
01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:01.900
Just shoot it up there and blow it up.

1107
01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.360
And they all sat around and thought about it and go,
can we do that?

1108
01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:05.231
Don't you do that?
Well,

1109
01:07:05.231 --> 01:07:10.231
John Wayne made a movie con in the crater of a fucking nuke.

1110
01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:16.440
We have surface detonated and then like eight years later they made a film in

1111
01:07:16.721 --> 01:07:21.370
the crater.
Really?
That's why everybody on that fucking movie died of cancer.

1112
01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:26.460
I did hear that he had done some movie and they filmed it somewhat clear they're

1113
01:07:27.251 --> 01:07:30.320
doing nuclear experiments,
but I didn't know they filmed it in the crane.

1114
01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:33.640
The fucking crater did.
You can see black Google.

1115
01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:37.480
Ralphie may requires a lot of Google.
I'm sorry.

1116
01:07:39.210 --> 01:07:44.210
Okay,
so it's a John Wayne.
John Wayne.
Oh,
can I guess con.

1117
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:48.400
Hi,
you spoke,
you lose multiple spellings,

1118
01:07:48.401 --> 01:07:51.850
but I think it's g e n G.
H.
I s c.
H.

1119
01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:55.790
I s and then con k.
H.
A.
N.

1120
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.060
That was the role that he played.
I don't know if it's the name of the movie,

1121
01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:06.880
but everybody on that fucking thing from the set directors to catering died of

1122
01:08:06.881 --> 01:08:08.260
cancer.
Wow.

1123
01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:12.920
Did dingus con nuke John Wayne right away,
man.
Right away.

1124
01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:16.100
The stories about it.
Creepy fucking right,
right.
Wow.

1125
01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.080
No two pack a day.

1126
01:08:18.081 --> 01:08:23.081
Smoker and sieve above ground nuclear weapons testing occurred at the test site

1127
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:28.670
as part of operation upshot knothole.
I'm telling you,

1128
01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:32.150
man casts when the pictures come from,
she used to do shit back there,

1129
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:37.151
but 1981 91 of them had developed some sort of form of cancer and 46 had died of

1130
01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:43.190
the cancer.
Holy Shit.
120 people in the entire cast and crew,

1131
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:44.660
almost half of them.

1132
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:49.460
That would be continuous exposure over multiple weeks,

1133
01:08:49.461 --> 01:08:53.810
but they filmed really fast.
Back then.
It wasn't even like it was nowadays.

1134
01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:55.700
You know how long they were there for?
Yeah,

1135
01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:59.120
but what if they just all eight red m and m's or something like that?
You know?

1136
01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.650
Like what if it was just something else?

1137
01:09:01.190 --> 01:09:05.590
Nothing to do with the fact they weren't afraid of [inaudible] crater.

1138
01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:07.850
Blown up by an atomic bomb.

1139
01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:12.980
I have like 5,000 years and you're just chilling there filming tag toe.

1140
01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:16.340
But I wouldn't feel now what?
Can we get another take on that one?
Yes.

1141
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:20.960
As would you be?
How pissed would you be?
You like you didn't know.

1142
01:09:21.230 --> 01:09:25.820
You didn't know?
The actors don't know.
You think John Wayne?
No,
he didn't know.

1143
01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.580
Nobody knew.
The producers didn't know either.

1144
01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:32.360
No one knew where they got cheap shooting.
They fucking knew that long ago,
man.

1145
01:09:32.361 --> 01:09:34.670
That's like the 19 fucking sixties and shit.

1146
01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:40.970
I'm not so people shit just then.
So it's like 50 years ago,
man,

1147
01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:45.140
we didn't know shit.
Amazing.
That's incredible.
Where's your,

1148
01:09:45.141 --> 01:09:47.750
where's your survival place?
I Dunno man.

1149
01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.940
I'll go back to Colorado when the shit hits the fan.

1150
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:52.910
You still have your place in Colorado?
No,
no.

1151
01:09:52.911 --> 01:09:54.530
I only least it at least there for a year.

1152
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:58.220
My solely go back there and I save a place would be the shower curled up in the

1153
01:09:58.221 --> 01:09:59.054
fetal position.

1154
01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:02.930
I'm going to kiss your name down in my mouth before drive off into the

1155
01:10:02.931 --> 01:10:07.010
background.
Yeah,
right.
Zombie hordes.

1156
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:11.690
They'll be coming for you son.
Man.
It will get very within days.

1157
01:10:11.691 --> 01:10:14.060
Metropolitan areas will be mean with that.

1158
01:10:14.061 --> 01:10:17.510
With with the interruption of basic service,
I'd probably go right to Cologne.

1159
01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.840
Yeah,
that's the problem.
It only needs to be out for a couple of weeks.

1160
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:26.030
What could happen in the fucking horror jump in and Katrina,
terrible man.

1161
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:28.960
I've watched documentaries on that shit and it's just,
it's hard.

1162
01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.870
It's like anyone civilization just shut down,
shut the fuck down.

1163
01:10:32.871 --> 01:10:34.580
And it only took a matter of days.

1164
01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.870
Tell you why you take fresh water and electricity away from people and they go

1165
01:10:38.871 --> 01:10:43.500
fucking cuckoo for cocoa puffs.
It is amazing when you're done well.
Yeah,
no.

1166
01:10:43.501 --> 01:10:47.390
When they go animal and it's hot as fuck,
they're stuck very well.

1167
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:50.240
You're not supposed to be there.
The whole cities and I'm supposed to be there.

1168
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:52.190
It's not supposed to be underwater like that.

1169
01:10:52.191 --> 01:10:54.530
That's the crazy thing is it's below sea level,

1170
01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.950
so you have walls up to keep the ocean out.
Holy Shit.

1171
01:10:57.951 --> 01:11:02.270
And this is where you share the Mississippi sleep.
Yeah.
They go,
Whoa,

1172
01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.770
it's awesome,
but why is it awesome?

1173
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:05.360
It's awesome because there's people that are awesome.

1174
01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:07.580
Why don't move the awesome people?
It's all make an agreement.

1175
01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:10.700
Let's all move are awesome.
They know what they want to do up to higher ground.

1176
01:11:10.730 --> 01:11:13.880
If they,
if they hadn't had this recession,
they were talking about,
uh,

1177
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:18.720
the largest,
um,
uh,
public's work,
uh,
Vang ever.

1178
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:24.080
They were going to detour the Mississippi to re around the city of New Orleans

1179
01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:29.800
to make,
uh,
a Delta,
uh,
to protect it all right?

1180
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:33.850
And they were going to reroute the Mississippi.
It's what they will.
Uh,

1181
01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:38.790
the corps of engineers had slated as the largest public works larger than the

1182
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:39.510
Hoover Dam,

1183
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:44.370
exponentially larger Jesus Christ and an incredible waste of money.

1184
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:45.950
But they were going to,

1185
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:47.580
you're going to build all this thing that we're going to help.

1186
01:11:47.890 --> 01:11:50.880
And the idea is because it's so awesome.
New Orleans is so awesome.

1187
01:11:50.881 --> 01:11:54.450
This is why that it needs to be protected.
Oh,
this is kind of crazy man,

1188
01:11:54.451 --> 01:11:58.590
because it's not like there's a lack of places to move to cause a lot of spots

1189
01:11:58.591 --> 01:12:02.240
in this country you could relocate.
Oh,

1190
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:05.130
how many people are living in New Orleans though?
It's Kinda be like a million,

1191
01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:10.020
right?
Yeah.
But you know,
it's a great generator for Louisiana.

1192
01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:13.620
Yes.
The real problems,
like moving them quick.
Impossible.
It's just,

1193
01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:16.260
there's too many people.
Oh Man.
I know.
Houston is not the same since Katrina,

1194
01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.390
but they should have sloped.
It's not right.
It's really not.
Dude,

1195
01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:22.610
it's gets really fucking night.
It's an,
I mean,
the murder rate,
you know,

1196
01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:27.540
went up like 340% dude,
while we were there.
A right afterwards.

1197
01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:28.440
And uh,

1198
01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:32.130
you could see like all these people that had been displaced or all over the

1199
01:12:32.131 --> 01:12:36.300
streets of downtown.
Oh,
this is like way different than it was just a year ago.

1200
01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:39.980
Yeah,
man.
He whole New Orleans things gonna suck because New Orleans,

1201
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:42.510
like everybody talks about how great the city is.

1202
01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:46.620
Like people fucking loved that place.
They love it and love it and that,

1203
01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:49.550
that's what it's like in this shit spot.
Like fuck man.

1204
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:53.910
You can what I was saying that he nonsense.
You really could never move it.

1205
01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:56.910
You would never recreated it.
Wouldn't work.
It wouldn't,
it's a terrible idea.

1206
01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.010
But you know,
it'd be busy.
Too Bad.

1207
01:12:59.011 --> 01:13:03.420
They didn't slowly like fucking creep back into an area and keep New Orleans but

1208
01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:06.300
slowly lists a lot of people in new water will hit.
I,

1209
01:13:06.330 --> 01:13:08.820
I lived in new Elantra like six months to gym.

1210
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:13.180
I was cooking at Nolas and um,

1211
01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:17.100
there's a lot of people in New Orleans that believe again,

1212
01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:21.420
because it happened once in the 60s during,
I think it was Camille,

1213
01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:25.710
that white people from a lake potch train blew up.

1214
01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.970
Dynamited the the levees.
Really?
Yeah.

1215
01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:33.090
Cause that spike Lee conspiracy.
Now that's a fact.
It's a fact.
It's a fact.

1216
01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:34.290
And that,

1217
01:13:34.290 --> 01:13:39.290
and that people heard loud explosions that were still on their rose.

1218
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:43.950
Majority of them died when they drown.
But okay,
so these people,

1219
01:13:43.951 --> 01:13:46.110
they blew up the levees to drown the black people.

1220
01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:50.990
No to drain lake Pontchartrain cause it's Lake Pontchartrain with the Ma bell

1221
01:13:50.991 --> 01:13:52.990
largest amount of water you're keeping back.
Okay.

1222
01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:56.340
So in the areas that happen to bay or the nights they want,

1223
01:13:56.510 --> 01:14:01.510
why they want to do that to save the white communities on punching the really

1224
01:14:01.681 --> 01:14:04.500
expensive homes.
Oh,
okay.
So they took it upon,

1225
01:14:05.130 --> 01:14:07.770
those homes were going to get encroached by water.
Yeah.

1226
01:14:07.771 --> 01:14:12.100
The water was about was about the flood.
So they jacked it buddy

1227
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.070
<v 3>by breaking it dams and then killing a bunch of people,
much people must've died.</v>

1228
01:14:15.071 --> 01:14:15.904
Right?
Yeah.

1229
01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:21.030
That's where I think 95% of the casualties from Katrina happened was the

1230
01:14:22.151 --> 01:14:26.680
flooding.
And people go,
you know,
you've got time.
And it's like,
no,

1231
01:14:26.681 --> 01:14:30.430
you're not.
You know what I mean?
That water's coming in and like,
you know,

1232
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:34.600
a foot every second fuck.
Yeah.

1233
01:14:34.650 --> 01:14:35.650
And it's like you can't,

1234
01:14:35.651 --> 01:14:40.651
when the fuck you go fucking knock a hole in your house because there's water

1235
01:14:40.901 --> 01:14:42.610
outside up to the second floor,

1236
01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:49.210
crazy.
And you're stuck in the attic and that outside,

1237
01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:53.710
it's 108 degrees and a your bacon.

1238
01:14:53.711 --> 01:14:56.920
And that's when people die.
Wow.
And there was a big,
big,

1239
01:14:56.921 --> 01:15:00.390
big problem with the amount of response and the quickness.
They're responsible.

1240
01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:02.260
Yeah,
man.
I mean we can,
you know,

1241
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:07.500
18 hours we can be in fucking Afghanistan with 10,000 troops in 18 hours.

1242
01:15:09.730 --> 01:15:12.040
We couldn't go to New Orleans.
There's no money.

1243
01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:15.610
There's no money in being able to go to New Orleans.
It's crazy,
man.

1244
01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:18.850
Money isn't going to countries with tanks and taking care of business.

1245
01:15:20.230 --> 01:15:23.530
It's like,
you know,
and it's a Cooper's.
They're going,
hey was,
hey,

1246
01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:26.700
this is cell phone and shit.
Oh well we don't want to see it.

1247
01:15:26.701 --> 01:15:29.960
And we watch Fox News and Bill O'reilly says that those black people should've

1248
01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:34.540
left and fuck him.
No,
no,
he did not say that.
No,
no.

1249
01:15:34.541 --> 01:15:38.140
But he just gives off attitude.
Fox News gives off a,

1250
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:42.910
a actually a attitude that's shared by a lot of people that those people know

1251
01:15:42.911 --> 01:15:45.730
that the hurricane was coming and they should just leave.
And,

1252
01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.130
but life on the Gulf,
if you ever lived there,
I mean,

1253
01:15:48.131 --> 01:15:51.700
you never think you're going to get fucking hit this.
Yeah.
You have parties.

1254
01:15:51.730 --> 01:15:55.930
And the truth is that a power is out for a week,
week and a half,
two weeks.

1255
01:15:55.930 --> 01:15:58.780
If you could take it,
fuck it,
there'll be ice,
you know,

1256
01:15:58.781 --> 01:16:02.200
you'll be able to stay in your house and you won't get looted.
All right?

1257
01:16:02.530 --> 01:16:05.980
But you're also talking about people who are dirt poor and don't have a

1258
01:16:05.981 --> 01:16:10.300
disposable,
you know,
in case the fucking hurricane hits right now,

1259
01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:14.560
of course I've got,
you know,
$500 to take me to Houston telling my relatives are,

1260
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:16.420
well,
on an individual basis,

1261
01:16:16.421 --> 01:16:19.660
you could always understand everybody's own problems and getting out of there.

1262
01:16:19.661 --> 01:16:22.900
But if you look at it objectively there,
right?
The people who are saying,

1263
01:16:22.901 --> 01:16:24.040
why are they living there?
They're right.

1264
01:16:24.041 --> 01:16:27.220
You really shouldn't be living in a place where you're that close to some sort

1265
01:16:27.221 --> 01:16:29.740
of core of engineers is fucked it up.
I mean,
you know,

1266
01:16:29.741 --> 01:16:31.840
the core of engineers fucked it up.
Yeah.
When they,

1267
01:16:31.841 --> 01:16:36.010
when they dredged and they put the inner coastal channel in,
they,

1268
01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.370
they stopped the,
um,
the wetlands from being formed.

1269
01:16:39.610 --> 01:16:41.470
The Natural Delta effect of the,

1270
01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:46.120
of the Mississippi has to meander and they fixed it so they had proper channels

1271
01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.950
to for shipping or you know,
and,

1272
01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:52.840
and what's happening is it's eroding coastline and coastline is going farther

1273
01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:55.900
and farther back.
I said,
mate,
constantly built up.
It's being,

1274
01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:00.960
it's being allowed to erode and that's why hurricanes over the future are going

1275
01:17:01.481 --> 01:17:05.680
to be more damaging to the city of New Orleans.
And why is that important?

1276
01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:09.710
Because 80% of,
well,
I know as soon as Katrina happened,

1277
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.730
<v 2>there was no fuel in Nashville.
There was no fuel,</v>

1278
01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:16.010
there was no gas stations.
All right?

1279
01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:19.670
And it got crazy quick and people were like having to go out and see their

1280
01:17:19.671 --> 01:17:24.410
neighbor and say,
Hey,
uh,
do you,
uh,
do you have gas?
Yes I do.

1281
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:29.170
I need to go shop.
And I do too.
Great.
Then when you want to go,
all right.

1282
01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:33.440
It was crazy.
You know,
we have enough gas to go shopping in Nashville.

1283
01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:34.820
How long is this going for?

1284
01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:39.350
It was gone on for like two and a half weeks and it didn't happen in Georgia
too.

1285
01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:41.110
It happened.
It happened a lot of states.

1286
01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:44.900
We were in Atlanta while that was going down and the people were talking about

1287
01:17:44.901 --> 01:17:46.260
it when we're working at the,
um,

1288
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:49.330
the punchline and the employees were talking about,
yeah,

1289
01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:52.520
there was no gas and people were waiting in line giant lines to get in giant

1290
01:17:52.521 --> 01:17:55.550
lines and,
and as soon as you say you would,
you would,
uh,

1291
01:17:55.580 --> 01:18:00.070
people were going on their CBS and Internet and looking for,
uh,

1292
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:05.060
trucks.
I mean,
you know,
any truck,
any tanker that was going through,
uh,

1293
01:18:05.061 --> 01:18:08.180
was being diverted to,
and we don't understand how close we are to the tip.

1294
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:12.670
It does.
We are less than eight hours away from total catastrophe at anytime.

1295
01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:16.790
God dammit,
Ralphie May.
Why are you bringing this doom and gloom positive?

1296
01:18:16.791 --> 01:18:19.770
I'm trying to be positive and I'm just trying to tell you that you're right to

1297
01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:23.750
train and be,
you have saved and be fucking,
you know,
closer to your chimp.

1298
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:25.850
All right?
Because we are very close,
you know,

1299
01:18:25.851 --> 01:18:29.540
with our fucking iPhones and everything like this and twittering and all this

1300
01:18:29.541 --> 01:18:30.321
shit.
You know,

1301
01:18:30.321 --> 01:18:34.040
we've got this amazing amount of power that electromagnetic pulse would knock

1302
01:18:34.041 --> 01:18:38.960
out completely.
All right.
Or,
or say,
say fucking a new terrorist,

1303
01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:42.560
you know,
instead of,
instead of going for the fucking towers,
all right.

1304
01:18:42.561 --> 01:18:46.640
They flew into that fucking Indian river flooding a nuclear facility,
you know,

1305
01:18:46.641 --> 01:18:51.530
that's between Poughkeepsie in New York and it radiated all in New York or hyper

1306
01:18:51.531 --> 01:18:56.300
Novas.
I was watching this doc,
hyper Novas and other galaxies,

1307
01:18:56.530 --> 01:19:00.140
these hyper Novas.
Um,
the first,
when they first started recording him,

1308
01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:03.920
they had no idea that anything could emit this much power.

1309
01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:05.870
Hyper Novas have so much power.

1310
01:19:05.871 --> 01:19:09.290
They have more power than all the stars in the sky combined.

1311
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:13.370
And they happen all the time.
They happen all the time.
A couple times a day.

1312
01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:16.040
They're like all throughout the day they're happening.
And these waves,

1313
01:19:16.041 --> 01:19:18.590
these massive waves of energy that cosmic rays,

1314
01:19:18.591 --> 01:19:23.591
and it's this just fucking massive Super Nova Sun exploding.

1315
01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:28.340
Yvette rip that which destroy the entire galaxy.

1316
01:19:28.341 --> 01:19:31.550
Just cut through it and just rape everything.

1317
01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:36.380
Leave everything in there and dead and just,
it would start a new cook,

1318
01:19:36.381 --> 01:19:41.381
the galaxy and then it's going off pop pop.

1319
01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:46.880
He said going off,
dude,
it's fucking mind blowing.
What's out there,

1320
01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:52.250
you know,
look at what could kill all of us.
It was a great special on PBS.

1321
01:19:52.251 --> 01:19:54.260
I don't know if you saw it.
I don't need to watch that shit.

1322
01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:58.480
Think like that all the time.
Or is this at Walmart and somebody stabs you?

1323
01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:02.780
You know,
you're a kid in Milwaukee.
Scared of Walmart,

1324
01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:09.000
Walmart guess.
Yeah.
And that's just tons of weapons there.

1325
01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:12.250
Someone pulled a knife on you at Walmart.
Oh No,
no,
no.

1326
01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.910
In my face.
That's true to some douchebag.

1327
01:20:17.911 --> 01:20:20.070
Cholo supernova.
I want to start some shit.

1328
01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:26.550
Cosmically we were wearing chargers.
Jerseys.
All right.
We got stabbed by Raiders,

1329
01:20:26.551 --> 01:20:29.850
man.
Dude,
I was watching something,

1330
01:20:30.130 --> 01:20:32.430
<v 5>reading some article online about dirt.</v>

1331
01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:37.450
They're watching these two galaxies collide somewhere and the know they're just

1332
01:20:37.451 --> 01:20:38.600
like starting to,
uh,

1333
01:20:38.890 --> 01:20:43.420
record this galaxies hit each other,
dude.
Yes.

1334
01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:44.860
I'm thinking about that shit.

1335
01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:49.420
<v 2>Like you knew you could get hit by a planet.
Everything has gravity.
So you know,</v>

1336
01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:53.520
the sun is the most dense thing and on the solar system,
all right.

1337
01:20:53.521 --> 01:20:57.900
And it's spinning in something more dense to make it spin in that area that

1338
01:20:57.901 --> 01:21:01.960
rotates something else that's even denser to cause it to have a gravity,
uh,

1339
01:21:02.130 --> 01:21:06.900
gravitational spin while exponentially spaces expanding out to infinity.

1340
01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:08.580
And it just fucking blows your mind.

1341
01:21:08.581 --> 01:21:12.240
And when you start listening to Carl Sagan and you start listening to,
you know,

1342
01:21:12.241 --> 01:21:14.130
I'm a Stephen Hawking,
you shit like that.

1343
01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:16.800
It's fucking mind blowing with these amazing,

1344
01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:19.350
whereas calm as we are about at all,
it's amazing.

1345
01:21:19.351 --> 01:21:21.330
We just kind of have to just accept it,

1346
01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:25.600
accept a certain level of anxiety and panic.
And it's like,
you know,
of,
of,

1347
01:21:25.690 --> 01:21:29.430
of what the fuck.
And there we got her back to religion.
It's not me,
it's God.

1348
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:34.550
<v 5>The big thing with the real serious conspiracy theorists is the 2012 thing.</v>

1349
01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:38.920
Ah,
big one.
And now 12.
And you know,

1350
01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:44.070
Maya Piru Annunaki connection that that's when the big planet that's on an

1351
01:21:44.761 --> 01:21:48.570
elliptical orbit that's 3000,
600 years away.

1352
01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:53.160
It comes around and comes into our atmosphere every,
you know,
3000,
600 years.

1353
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:55.170
And that's where we learned everything.

1354
01:21:55.171 --> 01:21:58.920
That's where the Annunaki came from and they taught us how to mine for gold for

1355
01:21:58.921 --> 01:22:00.930
them.
It's pretty trippy,
dude.

1356
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:03.370
<v 2>That's great.
I love it,
man.</v>

1357
01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:08.620
This guy's Zachariah died passed between us and the moon at big meteor.

1358
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:12.020
Um,
which time salad?
A bunch of times.

1359
01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:14.590
I mean the one that just happened like a month ago.
No,

1360
01:22:14.591 --> 01:22:19.510
I didn't pay attention to that.
Is it a big one?
It was big as a semi.
Really?

1361
01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:22.170
Yeah.
It hits,
it explodes in the fuck atmosphere.

1362
01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:26.450
And we have what they didn't say Barry in 1980 what it really,
yeah.

1363
01:22:26.530 --> 01:22:30.400
And something that's that size could do that.
Wow.

1364
01:22:30.430 --> 01:22:33.370
It's fucking amazing.
You know that plane,

1365
01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:35.200
<v 5>the plane that we're talking about,
the um,</v>

1366
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:38.500
the supersonic jet was going 2000 miles an hour,
right?
Yeah.

1367
01:22:39.070 --> 01:22:43.720
The asteroids that hit a lot of them are going 45,000 miles an hour.

1368
01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:46.590
Stop and think about that.
Vaporization

1369
01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:52.790
screaming through space and slamming into the earth.

1370
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:56.030
The one that killed the dinosaurs within the first second,

1371
01:22:56.060 --> 01:23:00.920
it was five miles deep into the earth.
Wow,
that's amazing.

1372
01:23:00.921 --> 01:23:04.400
And that's what off the Yucatan peninsula,
right within the first second,

1373
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:06.520
it was five miles

1374
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:11.460
<v 2>deep into the skin.
Even.
You won't even see that.
Like maybe on the other side.</v>

1375
01:23:11.490 --> 01:23:14.870
No,
it's the speed of light.
It would just be a flash and then you'd be gone.
Dude,

1376
01:23:14.871 --> 01:23:19.210
that would devastated.
And you know what?
Suck harder living you.

1377
01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:22.720
Couldn't you fucking live through that?
He wouldn't just some scurrying.

1378
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:27.490
It would cause massive steel and rat.
If this thing hits like,

1379
01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:31.600
like it did,
I mean it would turn the continents over.

1380
01:23:31.601 --> 01:23:36.070
The ultimate trip to think that 65 million years ago there was none of this.

1381
01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:39.250
There was none of us.
One to nothing even close.

1382
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:42.880
No flowering plants.
Everything was totally different.

1383
01:23:42.881 --> 01:23:47.881
65 million years crazy and giant lizards that just fucked each other up all day.

1384
01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:53.240
They ate each other.
Giant lizards capable.
He's,

1385
01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.590
they found out a t rex was a huge cannibal.
That's the most recent discovery.

1386
01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:00.070
Huge cattle,
everything each other.

1387
01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:04.080
That one dinosaur didn't even exist.
Those I don't even the triceratops.
Yeah,

1388
01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:06.670
well they found out it existed.
No,
it exists,

1389
01:24:06.850 --> 01:24:10.090
but they didn't know that it was just a mature version of another dinosaur.

1390
01:24:10.210 --> 01:24:14.680
What if there was only one dinosaur that lived in was a huge alien that ate all

1391
01:24:14.681 --> 01:24:18.360
these other creatures and barfed it out throughout the earth.
You know that,

1392
01:24:18.361 --> 01:24:20.740
that none of these animals actually even lived on earth.

1393
01:24:20.741 --> 01:24:25.741
It was just a another alien barfed it everywhere and it's like this big alien

1394
01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:32.020
just like bar and they bought that for 250 million years.

1395
01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.810
That adds up to the carpet dating all these fossils.

1396
01:24:34.811 --> 01:24:38.130
The fuck's wrong with you man.
You live in a cartoon.
He's,

1397
01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:41.720
it was just this one huge dinosaur that visited earth once in a while.
He like,

1398
01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:45.340
Hey,
let's to go barf on earth where a bit,
what if we're just a toilet?

1399
01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:49.780
We don't hear it.
Ryan,
you got brain damage,

1400
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:50.890
like need to find that.

1401
01:24:50.891 --> 01:24:54.820
That's what happened actually makes more sense than a lot of things.
Oh,

1402
01:24:54.821 --> 01:24:55.900
it only makes sense.
No,

1403
01:24:55.901 --> 01:25:00.340
I agree with you that a big giant dinosaur barfed out all these dinosaurs that

1404
01:25:00.341 --> 01:25:03.730
are here.
That's totally what I know.
Bones from eating them.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1405
01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:05.450
It's totally get it out.
Who should it out?

1406
01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:07.870
He ate 'em all over hundreds of millions of years.

1407
01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:12.130
He told her this and trust the entire evolutionary chain where you can see

1408
01:25:12.131 --> 01:25:12.340
whether,

1409
01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:16.330
you know they had like wags and then all of a sudden their spaces because we

1410
01:25:16.331 --> 01:25:18.970
don't know what's happened.
What's away.
That's what I'm saying.

1411
01:25:18.971 --> 01:25:21.310
That one dinosaur they gave you just said didn't exist.

1412
01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:24.160
Just found out it was a younger version of another dinosaur.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1413
01:25:24.161 --> 01:25:26.380
So all these other species and all these other dinosaurs,

1414
01:25:26.381 --> 01:25:29.740
we don't have any idea of this dinosaur is this dinosaur.
You know,

1415
01:25:29.770 --> 01:25:32.710
we find out new shit all the time.
We find out new shit all the time,

1416
01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:36.460
but they know most of what happened.
The thing.
The only thing is,

1417
01:25:36.461 --> 01:25:39.970
it's really weird about any fossils is that most things when they died do not

1418
01:25:39.971 --> 01:25:43.540
leave a fossil.
When you die,
most likely you're not going to leave a fossil.

1419
01:25:43.541 --> 01:25:46.880
You leave a fossil if you die in like a mudslide that you leave in a fall,

1420
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:50.260
most of the times you just say as the animals come along and eat your bones and

1421
01:25:50.261 --> 01:25:53.930
that's around.
It's the monster likes to eat dinosaurs in mud,
like like,
like,

1422
01:25:54.330 --> 01:25:56.500
like bear for instance.
Here's a perfect example.

1423
01:25:56.501 --> 01:26:01.000
It's very difficult to find dead bears.
We know bears,

1424
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:04.220
we know bears die all the time,
but you really run into them.

1425
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:06.770
<v 5>They're bodies that often.
That's because they eat them,</v>

1426
01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:11.030
they eat them and ratzy thumb and something hits the bones and coyotes eat them

1427
01:26:11.031 --> 01:26:14.930
and the bonds get crushed up and ground up come up on it within like a matter of

1428
01:26:14.931 --> 01:26:19.140
a week two,
I don't know how long it takes,
but yeah,
sometimes,
I mean,

1429
01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.950
I mean I've been walking through the woods in Arkansas and locked up on a deer

1430
01:26:21.951 --> 01:26:26.390
carcass.
Yeah.
I mean,
we're a whole deer antlers and everything,

1431
01:26:26.391 --> 01:26:30.440
but the point is if you want to find it,
I fossilized dear.
Good luck.
Yeah,

1432
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:33.110
good luck.
Good luck.
I mean,
deer have been around for,
who knows how long,

1433
01:26:33.111 --> 01:26:35.720
let's say a million years or so.
It's not long enough to make a fossil.

1434
01:26:35.721 --> 01:26:39.150
Where's the fossilized dear?
Well,
it's not our pitch there and shit like that.

1435
01:26:39.450 --> 01:26:44.180
Like that.
Perfect example.
The Pleistocene ended just 10,000 years ago.

1436
01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:45.140
I just,

1437
01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:48.830
I just found out recently that like saber tooth tigers and woolly mammoths,

1438
01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.610
they exhausted just a little over 10,000 years.
Right.

1439
01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:54.400
Where we are around does incredible.
Right where we are.

1440
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:57.560
Wrap your head around that.
Woolly mammoths were just 10,000 years ago.

1441
01:26:57.850 --> 01:27:02.030
Revenue man around this,
they,
there's scientists that want to recreate the,

1442
01:27:02.090 --> 01:27:04.670
the men or I've seen that Russian scientists,
they've,

1443
01:27:04.710 --> 01:27:09.080
they've got the DNA who tours as a huge field source in,
in,

1444
01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:12.860
in a very barren lands.
Yeah.
They're talking about how they could survive like,

1445
01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:18.950
and they would just fucking butchered them and cook up this delicious meat.

1446
01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:22.340
What do you think?
Oh,
I bet it's like bed bath,
bath or whatever it's called.

1447
01:27:22.341 --> 01:27:26.990
Bison,
Bison,
Bison.
We'll do a totally different type of animal though.
Yeah.

1448
01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:29.980
You know,
bisons are related to like horses and shit.
That's like the same.

1449
01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:32.780
The hoofed animals.
I mean like to the same,
you know,
they're different,

1450
01:27:32.781 --> 01:27:35.310
but they're related.
I don't think elephants in that.

1451
01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:37.890
I think that's a totally different thing.
Right?
Yeah.

1452
01:27:39.090 --> 01:27:41.840
But that's where they would incubate the,
uh,
the embryo.

1453
01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:45.260
So in Africa to people eat a lot of elephant.
Is that you?
They used to,

1454
01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:48.440
I know they still hunt them.
Yeah.
It's bad.
People don't understand that.

1455
01:27:48.441 --> 01:27:50.300
They kind of have to hunt them in some places.

1456
01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:54.600
Some places they overpopulate and they start fucking with the people that live

1457
01:27:54.601 --> 01:27:59.150
there and
fucking dead like most,
I mean,
it's,

1458
01:27:59.610 --> 01:28:02.690
it's horrible.
There any elephant of male elephants are fantastic animals.

1459
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:04.490
It's horrible than any of them have to get killed.

1460
01:28:04.491 --> 01:28:07.160
But if people are going to live there and elephant's going to live here,

1461
01:28:07.170 --> 01:28:09.890
you're going to have to choose between elephants and people or you're going to

1462
01:28:09.891 --> 01:28:12.950
have to move those elephants and get them somehow.
The fuck out of there.

1463
01:28:12.951 --> 01:28:17.210
I'm of the paypal thing,
man.
Elephant ears are delicious.

1464
01:28:17.670 --> 01:28:22.380
<v 3>Apparently the fuck is wrong with you today.
Leathery.</v>

1465
01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:24.660
I got hit by an elephant.

1466
01:28:24.990 --> 01:28:28.660
<v 5>Do you still have that elephant?
A horn.
The Ivory Dildo.
Do you still have that?</v>

1467
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:32.140
What?
You don't remember that?
No.
Okay.

1468
01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:37.450
<v 3>You don't remember an ivory deal dude,
that escapes you.
Really?
Wow.</v>

1469
01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:41.110
See I'm doing what you do now stu,
but I'm just making shit up.
Oh,
not fun as it.

1470
01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:44.950
That's a good for compensation is.
It was actually a possibility though.

1471
01:28:44.951 --> 01:28:47.580
I was like have an ivory dildo blackouts.

1472
01:28:47.650 --> 01:28:51.010
I've seen like I've met somebody that has like something ivory that's like,

1473
01:28:51.011 --> 01:28:53.860
why is that ivory?
That's go ahead and I'm trying to think like,

1474
01:28:53.890 --> 01:28:57.420
oh did I did a girl.
They had about it.
The thing about ivory is

1475
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:59.600
<v 5>there's a ban on ivory,</v>

1476
01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:04.780
but they harvested many tusks before the band that it's readily available.

1477
01:29:04.831 --> 01:29:09.150
You can buy pre ban ivory,
it's called and you got to look at it this way.

1478
01:29:09.151 --> 01:29:11.940
Those animals were already murdered and they were murdered for their hoe there.

1479
01:29:11.941 --> 01:29:15.750
Their horns,
you know their tasks and you know you should do something with it.

1480
01:29:15.751 --> 01:29:17.100
I mean someone should either have it,

1481
01:29:17.130 --> 01:29:21.600
you know and buy it as a decoration because it's beautiful and you know to

1482
01:29:21.601 --> 01:29:24.550
remind people that you know these,
these majestic animals,

1483
01:29:24.551 --> 01:29:27.780
you know live and they have these crazy horns or use it to make things out of
it.

1484
01:29:27.781 --> 01:29:30.640
But otherwise you're just wasting the fact that these things died.
Yeah,

1485
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:34.170
they don't make so bad ivory now but it is good.

1486
01:29:34.171 --> 01:29:37.770
So the fuck is wrong with you again

1487
01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:43.350
till you are like the perfect child,
the child.

1488
01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:45.330
So strange working with you.

1489
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:50.670
It is good self doubt and ivory soap is perfect.
That's all you need,
right?

1490
01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:53.820
Use Soap or do you go to the liquid soap?

1491
01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:58.550
Because I recently switched back to soap because I saw some study about how

1492
01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:03.680
dirty and gross soap is and then I went to body soap instead and then I recently

1493
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:08.400
back to body soap.
I use this stuff called defense soap.
It's all for grappling.

1494
01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:11.340
It's soap that's designed with all these natural oils in it,

1495
01:30:11.341 --> 01:30:13.440
like tea tree oil and stuff like that.

1496
01:30:13.441 --> 01:30:16.450
Eucalyptus oil smells great and it's,

1497
01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:21.030
it's probiotic so it encourages healthy bacteria and kills negative bacteria.

1498
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:23.610
Kills everything off,
recording bad off your body,

1499
01:30:23.611 --> 01:30:28.320
but it's not antibiotic or antibacterial so it doesn't fuck with a natural

1500
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:29.550
chemistry of your scan.

1501
01:30:29.551 --> 01:30:32.880
It actually enhances it and it smells good and it's healthy.

1502
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:36.630
It's really good for your skin and it's great for after Jujitsu cause you know

1503
01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:39.990
everybody,
when you do Jujitsu you always worry about getting skin rashes,

1504
01:30:39.991 --> 01:30:43.470
whether it's ringworm or some people would get staph infection from scratches

1505
01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:47.050
and shit like that to you so it wash cloth.
When?
When?
When?

1506
01:30:47.051 --> 01:30:48.900
When you shower with eating soap.

1507
01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:53.220
Sometimes I use a couple of different things I gave up on this first punch

1508
01:30:53.221 --> 01:30:56.880
things in my hand.
What's the shit like?
The bacteria and all that crap.

1509
01:30:56.881 --> 01:31:00.240
Get on that.
He's a freshman and use the same one.
I see.

1510
01:31:00.241 --> 01:31:02.580
I don't use anyone I to use my hand.

1511
01:31:05.050 --> 01:31:06.570
Thank you.
Clean the sponge off man.

1512
01:31:06.571 --> 01:31:09.360
He washed the sponge off and I don't think it's fucking rocket science.

1513
01:31:09.361 --> 01:31:11.010
You still might be too much of a pussy.

1514
01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:13.540
Don't be worried about bacteria and your sponge.

1515
01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:17.730
Should get that fucking soap in there,
you'll be fine.
But yeah,

1516
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:19.940
the defense soap is the shed.
If you want to try it out,

1517
01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:23.590
you go to defense soap.com I think.
And they're uh,
it's,

1518
01:31:23.630 --> 01:31:28.630
it's like it's the guy who owns the company is a guy whose kids wrestle and you

1519
01:31:28.831 --> 01:31:30.660
know,
he's always been around wrestling and you know,

1520
01:31:30.661 --> 01:31:32.970
he got tired of all these kids getting ringworm.

1521
01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:36.350
So he developed a soap that was a natural soap to combat combat.

1522
01:31:36.370 --> 01:31:40.110
Ringworm cause a lot of people to go and get antibacterial soaps and that

1523
01:31:40.111 --> 01:31:43.840
antibacterial,
it kills all the good bacteria.
So all the shit,

1524
01:31:43.841 --> 01:31:47.550
that's what you need to do is take what?
Probiotics?
Yeah,
when people don't know,

1525
01:31:47.551 --> 01:31:50.550
it's one of the most important things to when when cold season comes around,

1526
01:31:50.551 --> 01:31:54.270
man ain't hands wash your fucking hands,
but take probiotics.

1527
01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:58.530
Take like acidophilus and kids.
Yeah.

1528
01:31:58.531 --> 01:32:02.530
And tea is a good one too.
And the reason being is because these are aggressive,

1529
01:32:02.531 --> 01:32:07.090
healthy bacteria and when you come in contact with shitty bacteria,

1530
01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:08.140
you're aggressive,

1531
01:32:08.141 --> 01:32:11.440
healthy bacteria that you're getting from the acid office will actually fight it

1532
01:32:11.441 --> 01:32:15.730
off and it keeps your body healthy and strong,
strengthens your immune system,

1533
01:32:15.731 --> 01:32:19.330
wash your fucking hands and take that shit and we'll have half the problems.

1534
01:32:19.730 --> 01:32:22.690
I didn't have the hand sanitizer thing like crazy nowadays.

1535
01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:27.190
Johnny rotten was telling us a great story last night about soap is a fucking

1536
01:32:27.191 --> 01:32:29.980
amazing story that there was a massive wait till he gets here.

1537
01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.040
I think I'm going to be talking about it right now.
We'll have them come back on.

1538
01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:34.510
I don't know the full details anyway,

1539
01:32:34.511 --> 01:32:38.080
but I can't just tease people like that to him next week when maybe we might

1540
01:32:38.081 --> 01:32:40.450
have while we tweet,
tease them with the Guam story.
Anyway,

1541
01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:43.270
what happens is we'll go back to that,
don't worry.

1542
01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:47.750
And this guy figured out was that there was soap,
um,

1543
01:32:47.770 --> 01:32:51.220
in hotel rooms and he would go and he would wash once with it and he would put

1544
01:32:51.221 --> 01:32:54.970
it back and he thought,
what happens to that soap?
Do they throw it out?

1545
01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:58.120
So he contacted all these major chains of hotels.
It says,

1546
01:32:58.121 --> 01:32:59.380
what do you do with your soap?

1547
01:32:59.570 --> 01:33:02.380
We know when someone uses it once and just tosses it out.
They go,
well,

1548
01:33:02.381 --> 01:33:05.720
we just throw them away.
And he said,
well,
you know that there's like,
you know,

1549
01:33:05.721 --> 01:33:09.810
an incredible amount of people die of just diarrhea and children die.
Right?

1550
01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:13.360
The world countries because they don't have soap to wash their hands with and

1551
01:33:13.361 --> 01:33:15.670
they're just dying of diarrhea.

1552
01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:20.700
And this guy decides that he's going to organize this foundation to collect soap

1553
01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:26.830
from these hospitals and they clean off the soap and then be redistributed to

1554
01:33:26.831 --> 01:33:30.370
all these poor places and they're saving people's lives left to right.
Amazing.

1555
01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:34.750
Amazing Shit,
man.
Amazing.
But then without so well,

1556
01:33:34.751 --> 01:33:36.160
it just shows you how,

1557
01:33:36.161 --> 01:33:40.270
what's really going on is we're fighting off organisms all the time.

1558
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:43.740
It's a constant battle for organisms.
Yeah.
Of it.

1559
01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:47.410
Since there's,
you know,
six,

1560
01:33:47.411 --> 01:33:52.411
7 billion people on earth now that there'd be some micro that just like in

1561
01:33:53.531 --> 01:33:56.260
everything nature,
when population gets out of control,

1562
01:33:56.261 --> 01:33:58.510
that has to be something that calls the herd.
Well there is,

1563
01:33:58.511 --> 01:34:01.930
we just keep killing them.
We keep finding vaccines for them.

1564
01:34:01.931 --> 01:34:04.970
We keep finding ways around it,
but without a doubt that's what they're doing.

1565
01:34:04.970 --> 01:34:06.250
And try to like,
like you know,

1566
01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:10.970
antibiotic resistant tuberculosis or Murcia Staff.

1567
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:15.190
That's a perfect one because it actually comes from hospitals and I mean people

1568
01:34:15.191 --> 01:34:17.030
get in hospitals and it also,
um,

1569
01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:20.260
is one of those things where they suspect that a lot of what this stuff comes

1570
01:34:20.261 --> 01:34:24.580
from is people taking their antibiotics but not finishing the full cycle.

1571
01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:28.060
So when you take like antibiotics and only take it for a couple of days and you

1572
01:34:28.061 --> 01:34:31.750
go,
I think I feel okay,
well you haven't killed off all that bacteria.

1573
01:34:31.810 --> 01:34:34.510
So the bacteria that lives is stronger because of it.

1574
01:34:34.570 --> 01:34:38.290
And then it gets to leave off someone else,
you know?
So are we,

1575
01:34:38.291 --> 01:34:39.580
by fighting things off,

1576
01:34:39.581 --> 01:34:42.990
we're creating even stronger things and by our own stupidity,
you know,

1577
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.940
negligence and using drugs correctly and not just giving a shit.
You know,

1578
01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:50.920
you got to take probiotics,
people,
if you learn anything from this show,

1579
01:34:50.921 --> 01:34:53.950
it's that n that Ralphie may got arrested in Guam.

1580
01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:56.860
So Ralphy did you get strep throat a lot?

1581
01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:04.900
<v 2>I'm
not even answering.
All right.
So,</v>

1582
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:08.720
so meanwhile,
back,
back,
back in Guam,

1583
01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:11.000
Marianna's trench hard to his trenched in the world.

1584
01:35:11.001 --> 01:35:15.980
Yet you had this bag that you just let them go.
I had a backpack,
right?

1585
01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:20.360
And at the bottom of it,
I had 14 grams and a smelly proof bag.

1586
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:24.530
She's just Christ.
14 grams.
That's almost a pound.
No,
14 grams.

1587
01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:28.210
It's ounce ounces instead of grams.

1588
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:33.430
And 14 grams is almost announced.
Why do you have no,
no,
no,
it's,

1589
01:35:33.431 --> 01:35:36.820
it's half an ounce.
Half an ounce.
14 grams.
15 grams.

1590
01:35:36.821 --> 01:35:40.580
So why do you have that much weed?
Um,
I thought I took it all out.

1591
01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:43.460
I took out three and a half gram.
I mean three and a half.

1592
01:35:43.461 --> 01:35:48.410
What's annoying about grams and shit?
Grams or metric.
Okay,

1593
01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:53.300
but 20.4 ounces or not or that's the standard.
That's what we use.

1594
01:35:53.690 --> 01:35:56.350
So like we have all this shit mixed up.
Like grams are mixed up.

1595
01:35:57.020 --> 01:36:00.860
If you do a joke about grams are drug addicts,

1596
01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:06.830
no drugs or cereal lovers.
I always get them fucking confused.
Teddy.

1597
01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:10.730
That's weird.
They're from a different system.
Then when we get low,
we use grams.

1598
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:13.310
But like when someone talks to me about centimeters,
I have to go,
okay,

1599
01:36:13.311 --> 01:36:16.230
what is that?
What is that 1.34?

1600
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:19.940
I'm always dealing with kilograms two because 2.2 pounds we do fights in Europe.

1601
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:23.390
The weirdest one is in England they have stones.
Stones,
right.

1602
01:36:23.630 --> 01:36:26.450
Which is why I believe it's somewhere around 13 pounds stone.

1603
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:31.220
He'll say he's 10 stone.
That means you like 130 pounds.
Wow.
How weird.

1604
01:36:31.221 --> 01:36:36.170
Is that?
Crazy.
Yeah.
What does that mean?
They got a lot of leftover shit.

1605
01:36:36.171 --> 01:36:40.960
The reason why they drop ins and stuff like that.
What horses?
Uh,

1606
01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.220
Hans horses with hands,

1607
01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:48.420
they measure a horse is high and guitars by bias by its hands mean they call it

1608
01:36:48.621 --> 01:36:53.280
hands.
Like oh persons hand.
How many hands on person?

1609
01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:58.430
I think it's like 8.4 inches is his one hand.
I don't.
Wow.
Really?

1610
01:36:58.431 --> 01:37:02.440
Yeah.
Yeah.
So like a horse stance,
like 12 hands.
Big fucking horse.

1611
01:37:02.530 --> 01:37:06.620
How strange is the whole fucking measuring system being different everywhere.

1612
01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:08.960
Inches and kilometers.

1613
01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:13.970
We're all supposed to convert millions.
Just said fuck it.

1614
01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:16.760
Isn't that weird that we didn't do that?
How dumb are we?

1615
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:21.050
Like we wanted to make sure that people like figured it out.
So we said,

1616
01:37:21.051 --> 01:37:22.610
you know what?
It's too complicated.
People,

1617
01:37:22.611 --> 01:37:24.140
not enough people are going to figure it out.
Fuck it.

1618
01:37:24.230 --> 01:37:27.590
Oh it is is just a new system based on 10 yeah,
give you learn inches.

1619
01:37:27.591 --> 01:37:31.130
Fucking for sure you can learn kilometers.
It's all going away very soon.

1620
01:37:31.210 --> 01:37:35.740
Going away.
All the difference.
You know things like the,
the,
the grams,
the ounces,

1621
01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:39.770
the language barriers,
everything's fucking going away in like five years.

1622
01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:43.310
Even maybe 10 years when they get so good that voice activation,

1623
01:37:43.311 --> 01:37:45.830
like being able to like have something on your person.

1624
01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:47.330
So if a person's talking Japanese,

1625
01:37:47.331 --> 01:37:50.750
it's automatically just going to translate for you into English.

1626
01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:53.750
If somebody is telling you 12 feet and stay of 12 ounces or whatever,

1627
01:37:53.751 --> 01:37:56.550
it's going to cook.
When you translate languages,

1628
01:37:56.550 --> 01:38:01.140
<v 5>like say if you translate Japanese into English,
you're going to have to also,</v>

1629
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:03.870
if you're going to translate it into English and have it direct,

1630
01:38:03.871 --> 01:38:07.560
it's going to come out real funky because the way they talk and communicate is

1631
01:38:07.561 --> 01:38:08.550
almost alien.

1632
01:38:08.630 --> 01:38:12.300
And so there's a lot of creative license involved in structuring sentences that

1633
01:38:12.301 --> 01:38:16.110
are going to make sense,
easy compared to the most technology.
You know,
that's,

1634
01:38:16.170 --> 01:38:18.240
I mean,
look at the shit already.
I mean you,

1635
01:38:18.241 --> 01:38:22.060
you're fucking calling up Macy's and it's like say one,
you know,
say two.

1636
01:38:22.650 --> 01:38:27.210
And that's just like generic.
That is pretty dope.
I love the car thing.

1637
01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:32.100
I love being able to tell my car,
call Brian,
and it just calls you.
That's insane,

1638
01:38:32.101 --> 01:38:37.020
man.
That is so dope.
Yeah,
everybody's,
I volunteer going to do that.

1639
01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:43.250
It's amazing that,
that freaks me out.
And um,
my friend Cade has,
I'm not kidding.

1640
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:47.910
It was,
Dustin has,
I'm one of those droid exes and he's sent to fall to shit.

1641
01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:52.890
He sent a text by talking to it.
He's like talk to it and he no,

1642
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:56.820
he made something like,
you know I'm here with Joe Rogan and he says I love you.

1643
01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:59.880
And I look at it and it says I'm here with Joe Logan.

1644
01:38:59.881 --> 01:39:02.760
Those the only one who was wrong,
it picked up Logan instead of Rogan.

1645
01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:07.470
Was he like,
hey my battery's about to die on my droid.
Call me.
Call my friends.

1646
01:39:07.530 --> 01:39:12.480
Oh nevermind.
I don't know.
But it's fun.
Suck battery life.

1647
01:39:12.690 --> 01:39:15.300
They suck battery life.
Yeah,
but you can always keep an extra battery.

1648
01:39:15.301 --> 01:39:16.140
And the thing about iPhones,

1649
01:39:16.141 --> 01:39:18.600
it's suck cause it was when they die like yours did last night.

1650
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:23.750
Hi that they die and it takes 10 minutes to turn back on because they're sitting

1651
01:39:23.881 --> 01:39:25.530
there like a dumb ask on what the fuck.

1652
01:39:25.530 --> 01:39:28.680
It's like that last dollar of gas when you prepay,
you're sitting there going,

1653
01:39:28.681 --> 01:39:31.500
why is this going so slow?
There's no reason to force me to quit.

1654
01:39:31.630 --> 01:39:34.950
They want you to keep,
is that what it is?
Because you ever done that?

1655
01:39:34.951 --> 01:39:37.170
I've never done that before.
I've never walked away,

1656
01:39:37.290 --> 01:39:39.660
but I want to start doing that.
You want to walk away?
You're like,

1657
01:39:39.661 --> 01:39:41.550
you keep your dollar.
My fucking time here.

1658
01:39:41.551 --> 01:39:43.230
Holding your handle is worth more than a dollar.

1659
01:39:43.231 --> 01:39:46.290
To me that's like toilet bowl technology.
That should be fixed by now.

1660
01:39:46.291 --> 01:39:50.130
There should be no extra two minutes of waiting for the last dollar of gas.

1661
01:39:50.131 --> 01:39:51.720
When you pre play,
come on.
It's fucking,

1662
01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:54.480
they have one of those with the new iPhone.

1663
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:56.670
Remember how they used to be able to buy the old chart?

1664
01:39:56.671 --> 01:39:58.470
The the extra large charger.

1665
01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:02.460
It was gigantic and it was a not a charger whether battery and it was on the

1666
01:40:02.461 --> 01:40:05.870
back of it acted as a case but also acted as a battery and a double.

1667
01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:07.740
Did they have that for the new phone?

1668
01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:13.190
The new iPhone or the iPhone four but had one of those new big ones from

1669
01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:18.390
amazon.com is it a just as cumbersome and large?
It's pretty big.

1670
01:40:18.391 --> 01:40:22.080
There's a few different ones now that the new iPhone has like 40% more battery

1671
01:40:22.081 --> 01:40:26.700
life.
So does this one have double that a lot faster?
Yeah,
it's,
yeah,

1672
01:40:26.701 --> 01:40:31.410
it's the,
the,
the,
the ones that,
I forget the name of that company that makes it,

1673
01:40:31.411 --> 01:40:35.570
but they a double your battery life too.
We're Ofi Melfi Mouthy,

1674
01:40:36.150 --> 01:40:40.380
I dunno.
Like mouthy May.
Yeah.
Power and battery span.

1675
01:40:40.381 --> 01:40:42.380
That is a big major holdup there.

1676
01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:46.090
Like these electric cars are trying to put together.
That's all wealthy matters.

1677
01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:48.900
But when you're going 150 miles,
that's it.

1678
01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:53.470
That's the best you can do is 150 miles.
And that's if you drive cool.

1679
01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:56.080
If you don't freak,
like they took one of those Teslas,

1680
01:40:56.081 --> 01:41:00.280
you know they have those electric look sports car and they beat the fucking shit

1681
01:41:00.281 --> 01:41:02.170
out of this thing around a track.
But it was,

1682
01:41:02.171 --> 01:41:05.170
it was cooked in like a couple of miles,
man.
A couple of miles.

1683
01:41:05.171 --> 01:41:08.600
That bitch was done.
And how they did it like for maybe 20 miles or something.

1684
01:41:08.601 --> 01:41:10.150
And they've even ran this track a few times,

1685
01:41:10.151 --> 01:41:15.130
a few laps and then to full space cowboy [inaudible] juice.
It was done.
Yeah.

1686
01:41:15.131 --> 01:41:17.710
They tested it against a bunch of other cars like the Boxster and all these

1687
01:41:17.711 --> 01:41:19.270
different sports cars are different,

1688
01:41:19.271 --> 01:41:23.110
like a little sporty little sort of convertible type cars.

1689
01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.930
It's not there yet.
And other technologies not quite there yet.

1690
01:41:25.931 --> 01:41:29.530
And the wait is ridiculous.
So he got all this weight behind the car.
You know,

1691
01:41:29.610 --> 01:41:31.240
there's no real engine in the front.

1692
01:41:31.241 --> 01:41:35.290
It's not like a big Fucking v eight that balances out all these batteries in the

1693
01:41:35.291 --> 01:41:35.620
back.

1694
01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:39.460
Now it's like this weird little electric engine in the front and in the back

1695
01:41:39.461 --> 01:41:43.630
you've got this fucking giant bricks and bricks of these lithium ion batteries

1696
01:41:43.631 --> 01:41:47.560
and it's super heavy and they're going to die.
They're not going to last.

1697
01:41:47.561 --> 01:41:48.910
They're going to die off.
You know,

1698
01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.070
it's not simple like you just change the spark plugs.

1699
01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:53.410
Now you've got to get new batteries,
you've got all new batteries,

1700
01:41:53.411 --> 01:41:58.330
your batteries suck now.
[inaudible] it's weird man.
It's like that technology,

1701
01:41:58.331 --> 01:42:02.410
that area of technology.
It seems to be,
there's a little bit of a hump there.

1702
01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:07.370
Yeah,
it's going to turn into wireless and it has to be,
cause I know.
No Man.
These

1703
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:10.780
fucking thanks for that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1704
01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:13.450
It was Westinghouse and they found out what he was doing.

1705
01:42:13.451 --> 01:42:15.610
The closed them down and they shut him the fuck down.

1706
01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:20.010
Crazy guy wanted to give away free electricity to the whole will radiate down.

1707
01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:22.080
It's fair.
That's probably what's next though for a,

1708
01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:26.290
when it says AARP is based on heart,
based on Tesla's technology,

1709
01:42:27.010 --> 01:42:30.220
all technologies based on Tesla really is that.

1710
01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:34.960
But all modern technology fleshlight technology but directly did,
um,
a test lab,

1711
01:42:34.961 --> 01:42:39.940
something to do with it,
I would assume so.
I bet we're to find out a bed.
So,

1712
01:42:39.970 --> 01:42:44.650
you know,
it took him like 30 years after his death to finally get the credit for

1713
01:42:44.651 --> 01:42:48.420
inventing the radio descended from Tesla's work.
Wow.
Dude.
They,

1714
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:53.140
it took like 30 years after his death to get credited for inventing radio.

1715
01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:57.580
Yeah.
Yeah.
Everybody gives it to Marconi.
Yeah.
Still when you hear about it,

1716
01:42:57.581 --> 01:43:02.320
you hear Marconi.
Yeah.
You don't hear about a hundred different fucking things.

1717
01:43:02.650 --> 01:43:07.590
What Dude?
He was constantly inventing,
but they said he was like a,

1718
01:43:07.730 --> 01:43:12.400
um,
like um,
autistic.
He would be diagnosed today.
Oh yeah.
Well,

1719
01:43:12.430 --> 01:43:15.910
you know,
I've talked about that with a,
a friend of mine that I have that,

1720
01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:20.740
that has autistic children or a autistic kid and he's like the aptitude that

1721
01:43:20.741 --> 01:43:25.741
these kids have for learning things and for can co holding information and um,

1722
01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:29.260
for dispensing it and spitting it back out like he's like,
it's shocking.

1723
01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:30.340
It almost makes you think like,

1724
01:43:30.341 --> 01:43:34.130
wonder if this is like some weird hiccup up to the next stage of evolution that

1725
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:36.340
what we're seeing is obviously a disease.

1726
01:43:36.341 --> 01:43:39.340
These kids are obviously impaired when it comes to being able to communicate

1727
01:43:39.341 --> 01:43:43.030
emotionally and being able to reach out and don't you think nature constantly

1728
01:43:43.031 --> 01:43:46.510
when it goes to evolve a,
uh,
in,
in anything,

1729
01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:48.730
any form over the history of the,
of,

1730
01:43:48.731 --> 01:43:53.420
of the earth through evolution that it's made a lot of fuck ups tell the one

1731
01:43:53.421 --> 01:43:56.540
thing hit and then boom,
that's the next level.
Well,

1732
01:43:56.541 --> 01:43:59.360
that's the idea is that we have mutations and that from those mutations,

1733
01:43:59.361 --> 01:44:03.990
the ones that are useful are kept in a natural selection.
Dicks dictates that we,

1734
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:05.530
we move in that direction now.

1735
01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:09.410
But that's what all of the evolution of mankind or any animal supposed to be

1736
01:44:09.411 --> 01:44:12.710
from.
That's one of the theories.
You know,
there's a few theories,
but the,

1737
01:44:12.711 --> 01:44:17.300
the idea that these kids that are super genius kids,
like what they're having is,

1738
01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:17.930
uh,
you know,

1739
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:22.280
just like a blip or just a glimpse as to the potential of what human beings can

1740
01:44:22.281 --> 01:44:25.520
do.
There's this one kid,
man,
I don't know what we talked about on the podcast.

1741
01:44:25.521 --> 01:44:26.840
I think we might've,
he,

1742
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:31.930
he flew over Europe and looked out his window at Germany from his airplane and

1743
01:44:32.031 --> 01:44:36.710
then drew it when he got home.
Drew it in absolute perfect detail.

1744
01:44:36.711 --> 01:44:41.540
Every city,
every or every rather block,
every house,
every window,

1745
01:44:41.541 --> 01:44:44.120
all in the perfect place.
Perfect perspective,
perfect size.

1746
01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:48.050
It's fucking incredible.
And this is Lizzie human being.

1747
01:44:48.230 --> 01:44:50.990
This is a human being that can do something that I can't do and you can't do,

1748
01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:52.220
but you can't brush your teeth.

1749
01:44:52.250 --> 01:44:54.440
He has a hard time with a lot of other aspects of life.

1750
01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:58.910
And I'm wondering if like one of this is like some overpowering blip of the new

1751
01:44:58.911 --> 01:45:02.270
future.
You know,
this overpowering just like one little thing.

1752
01:45:02.271 --> 01:45:04.040
Like maybe he doesn't have the whole package,

1753
01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:07.730
he doesn't have the whole super fucking doctor Manhattan package.

1754
01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:12.050
That one gets to a thing that the one nun,
that ops spring.
What's that going?

1755
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:15.350
Maybe that's definitely wappinger guide though.
You know,
that's that same thing,

1756
01:45:15.351 --> 01:45:18.750
you know like the movie rain man,
whatever that disease is that,
yeah,

1757
01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:20.480
it is the same thing.
Autism.
Yeah.

1758
01:45:20.570 --> 01:45:25.570
So maybe anyone that's special needs is the future of what we know.

1759
01:45:25.641 --> 01:45:28.790
It's not special needs because a lot of that is just a mistake that,
you know,

1760
01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:32.680
in the dog eat dog world of nature,
we would not allow to survive.
You know,

1761
01:45:32.690 --> 01:45:36.290
if we were living thousands of years ago and you had kids that were like heavily

1762
01:45:36.291 --> 01:45:39.480
deformed,
they didn't live,
you know,
that's just what happened and get eaten.
Yeah.

1763
01:45:39.550 --> 01:45:43.270
I mean so,
but it's like,
but it all is mutation,
you know,

1764
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:46.420
mutations sometimes.
I mean,
the idea is that it's,
I mean,

1765
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:50.000
isn't it like the idea that a lot of mutation comes from radiation comes from

1766
01:45:50.001 --> 01:45:54.970
like just fucking shit and space and assignment that there's triggers mutation

1767
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:59.300
and sometimes these mutations lead to evolution to better survivability.
Yeah,

1768
01:45:59.301 --> 01:46:01.940
man,
it could,
it could very well be that what we're saying.
I mean,

1769
01:46:01.941 --> 01:46:04.880
could you imagine if you are a regular person who had,
you know,

1770
01:46:04.881 --> 01:46:07.940
regular social skills and totally normal and you regular insecurities,

1771
01:46:07.941 --> 01:46:12.941
but for whatever reason you were capable of looking at Berlin out the window of

1772
01:46:13.311 --> 01:46:16.670
an airplane and then just drawing it in extreme detail,

1773
01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:18.410
like into a point where people are shocked.

1774
01:46:18.411 --> 01:46:22.850
Like you've got some imaginary great website of retention,
but that'd be amazing.

1775
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:26.930
I mean,
man,
that's a photographic memory beyond comprehension,
but it's him,

1776
01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:29.420
but it's always someone who's fucked up.

1777
01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:32.960
It's almost like you only get so much horsepower,
you know,

1778
01:46:33.130 --> 01:46:36.710
and your brain has so much horse power.
How much do you want to dedicate to this?

1779
01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:38.720
How much is it you going to dedicate to art?

1780
01:46:38.721 --> 01:46:41.080
How much you're going to dedicate to think?
Well.
Yeah,
Michelangelo,

1781
01:46:41.210 --> 01:46:43.130
Leonardo Davinci.
I wonder what those dudes,

1782
01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:46.510
they were supposedly autistic according to,
you know,

1783
01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:49.940
cause they are in written history.
You,
I bet their pimp

1784
01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:52.320
<v 2>that Michelangelo and Da Vinci where both autistic.</v>

1785
01:46:52.321 --> 01:46:54.810
Why do you think that they say they were higher functioning?

1786
01:46:54.811 --> 01:46:57.690
Autistic is what they would be described as the real period.

1787
01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:01.050
But how do they know that they don't have any recordings of them communicating

1788
01:47:01.170 --> 01:47:04.050
diaries.
They have letters,
they have the communications,

1789
01:47:04.051 --> 01:47:05.030
the writings and I had to,

1790
01:47:05.031 --> 01:47:08.740
when she's writing expansively found your shit and they just looked at him and

1791
01:47:08.741 --> 01:47:13.500
go,
he's retarded.
Made was retarded.
They would be fucking A's.

1792
01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:17.580
Retarding saw his comedy and we knew he was a talented performer,

1793
01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:20.430
but we always wondered what was it?
Oh well we read his writing.

1794
01:47:20.431 --> 01:47:21.570
We realized he was retarded.

1795
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:26.520
People just like judge you and shit based on shit they find hundreds of years

1796
01:47:26.521 --> 01:47:27.680
from now that's can't do that.

1797
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:30.270
You can't tell me that Leonardo Da Vinci had autism.

1798
01:47:30.330 --> 01:47:33.420
That's what they're going to do.
You know,
if we caught Chaucer,
a genius.

1799
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:36.600
But there was some other guy who was a dirty guy,
you know,

1800
01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:39.190
I mean Chaucer's dirtiest thing was the Miller's tale.
Who,

1801
01:47:39.191 --> 01:47:41.500
who are you talking about?
Geoffrey Chaucer.
Who's done,
what does this,

1802
01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:45.450
the first novelist,
the first novelist ever.
Well,

1803
01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:49.530
he didn't write the first novel.
The first novel was bail will,
but uh,
the first,

1804
01:47:49.590 --> 01:47:52.110
uh,
novel of substance,

1805
01:47:52.111 --> 01:47:56.760
they was printed with the printing press was Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury
Tales.

1806
01:47:56.900 --> 01:47:58.800
Oh yeah.
And one of them is called the Miller's tale.

1807
01:47:58.830 --> 01:48:00.780
And like he uses the past tense of Shit.

1808
01:48:01.170 --> 01:48:06.030
And this is in like the 15 hundreds chat.
Yeah.
Powerful.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1809
01:48:06.031 --> 01:48:10.590
It was great.
And that
he's given credit with the,

1810
01:48:10.591 --> 01:48:12.630
creating the word fuck,
a great word is that,

1811
01:48:13.050 --> 01:48:14.610
and writing it down and you're using it.

1812
01:48:15.090 --> 01:48:18.030
But I thought that was supposed to be for fornication and the consent of the

1813
01:48:18.031 --> 01:48:21.210
king.
That's what it was originally for.
Unlawful carnal knowledge.

1814
01:48:21.211 --> 01:48:23.610
One of the two that does a lot of debate about that.

1815
01:48:23.611 --> 01:48:27.720
But he used it in print or like,
fuck you.
Like,
yeah,

1816
01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:32.610
like go fuck yourself real or let's fuck.
Wow.
Yeah.
Powerful.
And,

1817
01:48:32.611 --> 01:48:34.140
but there was somebody else.
I mean,

1818
01:48:34.141 --> 01:48:37.980
you think he's the only writer in all of England and then ever wrote a dirty

1819
01:48:37.981 --> 01:48:41.640
shit,
you know,
it just never got published,
you know,
late like,
like a,
you know,

1820
01:48:41.641 --> 01:48:45.960
if we just judge comedy by Seinfeld,
okay,
what we do,

1821
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:49.830
you and I,
but not even considered comedy,
we'd be ranting lunatics,

1822
01:48:50.250 --> 01:48:53.540
you know what I mean?
In comparison with the joke set up,
punch,
you know,

1823
01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:57.860
no opinion,
observational comedy,
you know what I mean?
It's like what?

1824
01:48:57.930 --> 01:49:02.070
He was the most popular and therefore he's known as that times greatest guy.

1825
01:49:02.130 --> 01:49:06.150
There is nothing that shows the evolution of culture more than standup comedy,

1826
01:49:06.450 --> 01:49:07.500
you know?
In my opinion,

1827
01:49:07.650 --> 01:49:11.700
it's real weird when you go back and like listened to like Lenny Bruce and
stuff.

1828
01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:15.750
I'll go back and listen to like,
this is stuff that he got him arrested,
you know?

1829
01:49:15.751 --> 01:49:19.830
And like,
yeah,
it's less than a potluck at the fucking comedy store.

1830
01:49:19.831 --> 01:49:23.580
You can get it on NBC comic standing with all the shit.
Yeah,
right.
Yeah.

1831
01:49:23.581 --> 01:49:26.850
I mean it's like barely offensive.
It's so strange.

1832
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:29.760
But he had some good shit though.
Even back then.
Yeah,

1833
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:32.610
he had some good perspectives on like the Catholic church and stuff like that.

1834
01:49:32.850 --> 01:49:36.100
How about on how he had on a bunch of different things.
Finally,

1835
01:49:36.210 --> 01:49:40.190
how about my favorite one was he did on a homosexuality being illegal.
Oh yeah.

1836
01:49:40.191 --> 01:49:44.220
Let's take this man,
homosexuality is illegal.
So they,
if if you're gay,

1837
01:49:44.221 --> 01:49:45.900
they arrest you and what do they do?

1838
01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:49.320
They put you in jail with a bunch of guys who want to have sex with you.
Yeah.

1839
01:49:49.530 --> 01:49:52.050
Yeah.
It didn't make sense.
It doesn't make sense.

1840
01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:56.620
This is a joke that he did in like the 50s and I saw a comic who I know is not a

1841
01:49:56.621 --> 01:49:58.110
joke thief,
but he,

1842
01:49:58.111 --> 01:50:02.950
he tried to resay it in like the nineties and I had to say,
you know,

1843
01:50:02.951 --> 01:50:07.480
that's like a Lenny Bruce joke from like 1950 [inaudible] and he was like,
shit,

1844
01:50:08.590 --> 01:50:13.060
of course somebody's already thought that up because that's what,

1845
01:50:13.610 --> 01:50:15.220
that's what's shitty about it.
All you know,

1846
01:50:15.221 --> 01:50:19.600
is that there's so much that it's come before us all.

1847
01:50:19.601 --> 01:50:22.470
That's great though.
That's great.
There's always still things to talk about it.

1848
01:50:22.471 --> 01:50:26.590
If it wasn't for them,
we would suck.
You know,
this,
you know,

1849
01:50:26.591 --> 01:50:31.120
the people need to slowly learn how to take a joke over the course of 50 or 60

1850
01:50:31.121 --> 01:50:34.450
years.
The kind of shit that you could talk or I can talk on stage now.

1851
01:50:34.510 --> 01:50:36.100
You couldn't do that back then.

1852
01:50:36.650 --> 01:50:40.510
Thank God that they did that because they broke a lot of boundaries,
man.

1853
01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:45.510
Richard Pryor got a lot of people used to people saying pussy and motherfucker

1854
01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:48.220
and he got people used to that shit.
You know,

1855
01:50:48.221 --> 01:50:52.120
Lenny Bruce got people used to questioning things,
questioning the use of words,

1856
01:50:52.121 --> 01:50:54.820
questioning,
you know,
all sorts of aspects of our culture.

1857
01:50:54.821 --> 01:50:56.440
They got people to take a joke.

1858
01:50:56.441 --> 01:50:59.710
They got people to like kind of lighten up and understand this.
Just relax.

1859
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:03.670
Everybody.
So worked up over now you know like um,
like uh,

1860
01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:08.440
the use of derogatory slang as far as names go,

1861
01:51:08.441 --> 01:51:12.370
you know,
it's,
it's just just all worked up.
Like your,

1862
01:51:12.371 --> 01:51:15.250
your outrage is a,
is a learned thing.

1863
01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:20.230
And if you didn't learn that the n word was something supposed to be offensive,

1864
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:23.320
it would just be another two syllable word.
And,
and,

1865
01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:26.740
and by calling at the end where you just embolden that wired and keep it in our

1866
01:51:26.741 --> 01:51:31.741
vernacular that if he used the word like groovy or far out or you know,

1867
01:51:32.381 --> 01:51:34.420
why do these words and phrases,
you know,

1868
01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:38.470
leave our vernacular and become on cool and groovy is still awesome.

1869
01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:39.933
It's still good.

1870
01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:44.940
I'm still down with groovy and if I see something I'll say far out right now.

1871
01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:47.610
Many people say it far out,
man,

1872
01:51:47.630 --> 01:51:51.710
he's far out and it be done using that from now on,
far out back.

1873
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:57.220
It's coming back like the fanny pack and Kenny Mack Common.
He'll bring it back.

1874
01:51:57.221 --> 01:52:00.580
The fat.
I don't give a fuck a rock,
a fanny pack.

1875
01:52:00.581 --> 01:52:02.380
Every time I travel and people look at me,

1876
01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:05.260
look at me like if they thought I was kidding.
I thought you were joking.

1877
01:52:05.470 --> 01:52:10.150
If they heard me say it,
love affair.
I mean what am I facts are good too,

1878
01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:14.640
but I like a fanny pack,
your fucking wallet and all your changing,

1879
01:52:14.641 --> 01:52:18.340
you know your team and your bullshit and just take it off,
put it back on.

1880
01:52:18.430 --> 01:52:22.120
It's much faster if not trying to get laid man.
So way to go.
Right.

1881
01:52:22.410 --> 01:52:25.950
And you know I took care of that a long time ago.
Hollaback.

1882
01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:28.720
It's funny how things come and go and style.

1883
01:52:28.721 --> 01:52:31.450
At one point in time I'll let her fanny pack was the fucking rage.

1884
01:52:31.890 --> 01:52:36.890
You have a Shit Dad with your dad and your dad have the neon green and pink one

1885
01:52:37.001 --> 01:52:40.200
green one and he's still,
I think he's still were breast cancer.
That one.

1886
01:52:40.570 --> 01:52:44.920
Hey Mirko Cro,
cop rocks one as do his whole team.
A lot of guys in MMA rock.

1887
01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:46.100
Mm.
Don't

1888
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:47.600
<v 5>fuck around Tim crater rocks.

Did it?
Yeah,</v>

1890
01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:53.040
the palms.

1891
01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:56.750
That time that we were hanging out at Forrest Griffin dude and he didn't like

1892
01:52:56.780 --> 01:53:00.440
hammer down on it.
He just enough to get your attention.
Okay,

1893
01:53:00.441 --> 01:53:02.960
late then why don't you go ask him to know.

1894
01:53:02.961 --> 01:53:05.990
He just walked up behind me and that was his way of saying I love your comedy.

1895
01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:07.690
Really?
Yeah.
No,

1896
01:53:07.691 --> 01:53:11.750
not a hello not of what's up and but you don't have to interview him on Friday.

1897
01:53:11.751 --> 01:53:14.190
I'm going to confront him with this information.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1898
01:53:14.370 --> 01:53:18.800
and you put me in a choke right there and I felt,
I felt like,
yeah,

1899
01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:21.830
I could go.
I could go out right now.
I mean,
it was like that.

1900
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:26.390
I've never been knocked down like that.
You don't get choked unconscious.
No.
No.

1901
01:53:26.391 --> 01:53:28.280
It's not fun.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That,

1902
01:53:28.290 --> 01:53:32.690
that was the first time that I'd ever even come close got,
you know,

1903
01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:34.100
I don't get into shit like that.

1904
01:53:34.101 --> 01:53:39.101
You know a funny one to tie a tie around your neck while you fucker fuck no,

1905
01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:44.080
no.
What's wrong with pussy?
Why is everybody got to augment and accelerate it?

1906
01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:48.060
She wants you to fuck her wash is holding your time.
Squeezing the time.
No,

1907
01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:52.720
I met her gun and they like that.
That's great.
That sounds awesome to check out.

1908
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:56.180
If she could tie me up.
I was like,
bitch,
are you crazy?
Yeah,
no shit.

1909
01:53:56.870 --> 01:54:01.610
Your fucking mind.
Right.
To control him saying he many,
many years,

1910
01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:05.860
<v 5>I had terrible judgment when all I cared about was what if there were hot,</v>

1911
01:54:06.010 --> 01:54:09.310
you know,
like you're funny.
She was hot and I can get her.
I'm like,
wow.
You know,

1912
01:54:09.311 --> 01:54:13.470
like when I was like 22 I was an idiot and a this one chick that I did,

1913
01:54:13.471 --> 01:54:16.360
it was just fucking completely bananas and she wanted to,
she was,

1914
01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:20.740
she used to get mad at me and she would get mad.
She would pick up a knife.

1915
01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:23.350
I'm not,
I'm not boasting.
She wouldn't do anything with it.

1916
01:54:23.490 --> 01:54:25.720
Which you pick up a knife and hold it in her hand when she would get mad.

1917
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:29.040
I'm like,
bitch,
you better put the fucking weapon down

1918
01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:32.990
<v 2>cause this has been wow right now.
Wow.
You're at a different level,
dude.</v>

1919
01:54:33.110 --> 01:54:36.950
I think that you attract those types of brides.
You know what I mean?

1920
01:54:37.170 --> 01:54:40.340
Like I never met a chick like that would pull a knife on you and shit.

1921
01:54:40.350 --> 01:54:43.780
She didn't pull the knife.
She's going to use it.
She would just hold it.
Yeah,

1922
01:54:43.781 --> 01:54:44.670
that's what I'm saying

1923
01:54:47.950 --> 01:54:52.640
as fuck though,
Dude.
Crazy.
Right?
Oh this bitch.
Yeah,

1924
01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:56.000
she was crazy.
She just beyond crazy.
That's,
that's what I'm talking about.

1925
01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:59.900
And where did they go?
They become mothers and then fucking minivans.

1926
01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:03.510
<v 5>I don't know.
No idea where this one,
this is one.</v>

1927
01:55:03.511 --> 01:55:06.360
I would probably like to see your Facebook page.
Find out what the fuck.

1928
01:55:06.630 --> 01:55:08.430
I don't remember her name though.
I remember her first name.

1929
01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:09.353
[inaudible] last name.

1930
01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:12.510
Isn't it crazy to think of all the fucking women you've been with,

1931
01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:16.130
like how your life intersected with their life or where they net now is a bunch.

1932
01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:17.520
I'd like to go back,

1933
01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:20.610
but the thing is you don't because that's what you learned from.

1934
01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:23.730
You learn from and they learned from you and you learned from them and they're

1935
01:55:23.731 --> 01:55:26.580
not who they were back then and neither of you who you were and you weren't no

1936
01:55:26.581 --> 01:55:29.880
goddamn picnic either.
I was no picnic when I was 22 I was fucking crazy.

1937
01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:34.560
It was a completely insane when I was 22 when you were like knocking people out

1938
01:55:34.561 --> 01:55:36.810
and I'm still fighting.
No,
I would see what knocking people.

1939
01:55:36.811 --> 01:55:39.510
I think everyone really getting streets insane when they're 22

1940
01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:44.610
<v 2>know what I'm saying?
Every single fucking insanely</v>

1941
01:55:44.610 --> 01:55:47.400
<v 5>crazy.
Sure.
A lot of people are dumb and crazy and they're just,</v>

1942
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:49.110
they haven't got a handle on themselves yet.

1943
01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:52.590
But I was exceptionally fucked up cause I was still fighting.

1944
01:55:52.591 --> 01:55:56.150
I was still competing,
I was kickboxing and I was doing taekwondo tournaments.

1945
01:55:56.151 --> 01:55:58.980
And at that time I did not know what the fuck I was doing with my life.

1946
01:55:58.981 --> 01:56:01.140
And it was all spent on just trying to figure out,

1947
01:56:01.141 --> 01:56:03.870
it was all the martial arts competition had been my whole past.

1948
01:56:03.871 --> 01:56:05.880
And then I was trying to figure out what the fuck are we going to do with my

1949
01:56:05.881 --> 01:56:06.211
future.

1950
01:56:06.211 --> 01:56:08.430
And then I started getting into comedy and that's when I met this crazy pitch.

1951
01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:10.490
It's a knife,
the knife

1952
01:56:13.090 --> 01:56:17.020
<v 3>Boston with Denis leary being around every corner and,
and hearing about,</v>

1953
01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:21.970
you know,
Bill Hicks and that stuff.
Well Dennis leary fan first.
Oh,

1954
01:56:21.980 --> 01:56:22.590
we always good,

1955
01:56:22.590 --> 01:56:25.030
<v 5>huge Denis leary fan man.
I came to see Dennis leary wants,</v>

1956
01:56:25.031 --> 01:56:28.510
I paid to see dom Arrera and dom missed his flight.

1957
01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:32.230
Something happened or they rescheduled or whatever.
So,

1958
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:34.870
and Denis leary was the headliner.
I was like,
Oh,
who's this guy?

1959
01:56:34.871 --> 01:56:36.820
Where's Dom Irrera Shit.
I was like bummed out,

1960
01:56:36.970 --> 01:56:41.230
but leary went up and just lit that fucking place on fire.
Dude,

1961
01:56:41.231 --> 01:56:45.190
he destroyed [inaudible] based.
And I remember thinking,
Whoa,
like who is this?

1962
01:56:45.191 --> 01:56:48.110
Kind of saw this guy before.
And I was like,
I don't,

1963
01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:50.380
I think I'd maybe gun on stage once.

1964
01:56:50.590 --> 01:56:55.590
I was like a total raw open miker paying to see this local show on a date.

1965
01:56:56.500 --> 01:56:58.540
And I remember I told all my friends,
I brought a bunch of my,

1966
01:56:58.600 --> 01:56:59.470
I brought my roommates,

1967
01:56:59.471 --> 01:57:02.860
we went to see Dennis leary at Nick's comedy stop and fucking he,
they were like,

1968
01:57:02.861 --> 01:57:04.360
Holy Shit,
this guy killer.
It's awesome.

1969
01:57:04.810 --> 01:57:09.810
And then it was like maybe a month or two later Hicks came into town and uh,

1970
01:57:09.970 --> 01:57:10.721
everybody was like,
oh,

1971
01:57:10.721 --> 01:57:13.540
you gotta see this guy like Paul Barkley who was one of the owners of the comedy

1972
01:57:13.541 --> 01:57:16.880
clubs,
real comedy comedy kind of sewer.
Really love,
good comic con.

1973
01:57:16.890 --> 01:57:19.090
This guy's got great writing.
He got to see this Kylie's in town.

1974
01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:23.350
So I take his advice and I go to see him and I see great writing.

1975
01:57:23.351 --> 01:57:26.680
But I've heard these premises before and I've heard the bits before,

1976
01:57:26.860 --> 01:57:29.830
I've heard a couple of them and like there was like,
Holy Shit,

1977
01:57:29.831 --> 01:57:31.960
this guy's like doing the same stuff that Larry was doing.

1978
01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:34.800
Like the same premises about like Gee,

1979
01:57:34.801 --> 01:57:39.040
as Jim Fixx dying of a heart attack while he's jogging.
It's like a few of them.

1980
01:57:39.041 --> 01:57:41.770
They were like,
I don't remember if that was the specific one.

1981
01:57:41.890 --> 01:57:45.100
There was a few of them.
They were like really the same jokes and the same bits.

1982
01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:48.430
So I asked the local comics,
I go,
what the fuck is up?

1983
01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:52.360
And their response was leary steals,
they're like really leery,

1984
01:57:52.361 --> 01:57:55.270
just fucking steals,
he's a thief.
And I was like,
wow.

1985
01:57:55.271 --> 01:57:58.240
So He's stealing from this guy.
So this guy was like this,

1986
01:57:58.241 --> 01:58:00.730
like the most introspective,

1987
01:58:00.731 --> 01:58:03.600
really intelligent like guy who liked,

1988
01:58:03.630 --> 01:58:07.300
he really was looking deep in a shit and taken mushrooms and going on pay Odie

1989
01:58:07.301 --> 01:58:09.100
trips and trying to find himself.

1990
01:58:09.370 --> 01:58:12.510
And then I guess some people would just feeding off of it,
you know?
No,

1991
01:58:12.630 --> 01:58:17.580
<v 3>I know in Houston he let me open for him once at the laugh stop listed.
Yeah.</v>

1992
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:19.080
Cause I've been doing standup.

1993
01:58:19.081 --> 01:58:23.280
Kairos is 91 [inaudible] 91 wow.

1994
01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:24.270
And that's like,

1995
01:58:24.270 --> 01:58:29.100
how was he died in [inaudible] 93 [inaudible] 94 [inaudible] 96 [inaudible] 93

1996
01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:30.540
was it nice sex?
I don't know.

1997
01:58:30.750 --> 01:58:35.750
Sam died in [inaudible] 92 that made me cry this morning and made me cry pouch.

1998
01:58:36.901 --> 01:58:39.120
Darren talks about him in such a way.

1999
01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:42.730
I have a connection with a couple of radio guys like that where he talks about

2000
01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:46.570
we had Sam over,
we knew it was out of control,
you know,

2001
01:58:46.571 --> 01:58:49.180
we knew that he was fucking,
you know,
it was crazy.

2002
01:58:49.181 --> 01:58:51.580
And he was out of control and we knew he was gonna die,

2003
01:58:51.581 --> 01:58:54.430
but he was on the road and we wanted to give him a home cooked meal.

2004
01:58:54.431 --> 01:58:57.970
So we brought him home from radio and then we just never going to end.

2005
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.920
I have a friend of mine cow in Tampa and that's just like that.
And then that,

2006
01:59:02.921 --> 01:59:07.210
the fact that he died at 38 and I'm at my level and my comedy and I'm 38 and

2007
01:59:07.211 --> 01:59:10.600
it's fucking,
you know,
it fucks with your head,
Dude.
You know,
you especially,

2008
01:59:10.601 --> 01:59:12.430
you know,
you thinking about more challenging.

2009
01:59:13.570 --> 01:59:18.400
I think about it more and more sense of my children and that's why,
you know,

2010
01:59:18.401 --> 01:59:21.430
I'm losing weight slowly and it's,

2011
01:59:21.490 --> 01:59:26.170
it's plateaus unless I exercise.
And if I don't feel well,
I can our exercise,

2012
01:59:26.171 --> 01:59:31.030
you know,
I hurt,
physically hurt and um,
and then to compound that,

2013
01:59:31.031 --> 01:59:34.120
they want to give me a painkillers.

2014
01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:38.260
And if I take the painkillers,
I don't want to move.
You know what I mean?

2015
01:59:38.261 --> 01:59:41.740
So it's a weird place.
You know,
I've got physical Elma.
I mean,

2016
01:59:41.741 --> 01:59:45.640
I've got physical fucking problems.
I was at a car wreck.
I broke 42 pounds,

2017
01:59:45.641 --> 01:59:49.810
64 separate breaks.
I'm fucked up.
Whoa.
Wait a minute.

2018
01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:54.820
You were in a car accident and you have 42 broken bones.
Yeah.

2019
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:59.120
When was that?
Oh,
16 1988.
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

2020
01:59:59.510 --> 02:00:03.580
I was in the hospital for 48 days and then after that I was in a wheelchair for

2021
02:00:03.581 --> 02:00:07.600
10 months.
Oh my God.
Yeah,
that's bond.
The swelling I had,
um,

2022
02:00:07.630 --> 02:00:10.030
I broke my two vertebrae in my neck.

2023
02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:14.920
I cracked or fractured two vertebrae in my neck to three in my back.

2024
02:00:15.310 --> 02:00:19.060
I broke one of the wings off my vertebrate,
Eh,
that's all right there.

2025
02:00:19.061 --> 02:00:21.790
So I have psychiatric problems.
All right.

2026
02:00:21.850 --> 02:00:26.350
And that they say I have amazingly dense bones and that,
uh,

2027
02:00:26.351 --> 02:00:30.050
I was very fortunate to live through it and um,
you know,

2028
02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:32.770
it just fucking changes everything.
And then it goes,

2029
02:00:32.771 --> 02:00:36.290
you're fucking last couple of years of being a teenager then,
then you know,
as a,

2030
02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:40.390
people think you're retarded and you get for me.
They thought I was retarded.

2031
02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:43.720
And then they gave me a test and found out I was actually really smart.

2032
02:00:44.020 --> 02:00:47.110
And then they put me in this beginning scholars program at the University of

2033
02:00:47.111 --> 02:00:51.620
Arkansas and that's when I started doing comedy because my group met at a

2034
02:00:51.621 --> 02:00:56.490
Shakey's pizza on highway 71 in Fayetteville,
Arkansas.
And,
um,
uh,

2035
02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:57.760
my study group,
and again,

2036
02:00:57.761 --> 02:01:02.320
a chemistry met there and I fucking hung out.

2037
02:01:02.321 --> 02:01:05.950
And there was an open Mike contest and the winner got free pizza and a fucking

2038
02:01:05.951 --> 02:01:06.730
picture.

2039
02:01:06.730 --> 02:01:11.140
And I had a joke about Vanna white's the dumbest person ever on television.

2040
02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:14.020
She doesn't even have to hell no how to spell the words.

2041
02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:17.260
They light them up before and she just walks over there and turns the fucking

2042
02:01:17.261 --> 02:01:19.240
letter.
I mean,
somebody could tell her how to do it.
I mean,

2043
02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:21.970
why were you shocked when the fucking letter comes up?
You know,

2044
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:25.390
you don't even know how to spell it.
You're the dumbest bitch ever.
Okay.

2045
02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:29.650
And then I said,
um,
that I can't,
even though I love def leopard,

2046
02:01:29.651 --> 02:01:34.420
I can't see them.
I can't watch them because if I watch them,
uh,
you know,

2047
02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:38.500
in concert I feel like I'm mocking the drummer with two arms and clapping and

2048
02:01:38.501 --> 02:01:40.190
applauding and raising little hands up.

2049
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:43.030
<v 2>You know,
I feel like it was what,
how you wouldn't,
you're just started out.
Yeah,</v>

2050
02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:46.670
yeah,
yeah.
And,
and this is just,
you know,
general premise.

2051
02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:51.080
I had jokes within and I had seen it enough that I had this and I want to stand

2052
02:01:51.081 --> 02:01:53.450
up comedy contest and it went on from there.

2053
02:01:53.451 --> 02:01:57.110
I moved from the Shakey's pizza to the Ramada Inn out by the mall in

2054
02:01:57.111 --> 02:02:00.710
Fayetteville.
What?
I was going to school and it all happened because I got,

2055
02:02:00.890 --> 02:02:03.890
they tested me and I got into comedy,
you know,

2056
02:02:04.130 --> 02:02:06.920
they test to do and they tested me.
See if I was retarded,

2057
02:02:06.921 --> 02:02:09.800
the game and Iq tests and they found out I was actually born to be going into

2058
02:02:09.801 --> 02:02:12.620
comedy because I said you needed to go and tell jokes.
No,
no.

2059
02:02:12.621 --> 02:02:15.040
Is that fact that my study group showed up there at the,

2060
02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:18.830
at the Shakey's pizza where they had the dream of being a comic before that?

2061
02:02:18.831 --> 02:02:23.270
Or is it just did.
I had had,
but I never,
you know,
I mean,
I lived in Arkansas,

2062
02:02:23.271 --> 02:02:26.960
you know,
I went to school in Winslow,
Arkansas.
Okay.
Any comics from Arkansas?

2063
02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:31.880
There's a couple,
there's a couple Arkansas to crazy town.
Huh?

2064
02:02:32.090 --> 02:02:36.380
It's a crazy place.
Yeah.
It's a crazy state of state of mind.
He's shit there,
man.

2065
02:02:36.381 --> 02:02:39.270
That was a lot of things.
One what Bill Clinton became president there.

2066
02:02:39.271 --> 02:02:41.960
Like he was a governor of Arkansas.
I know,
right?

2067
02:02:44.210 --> 02:02:48.930
Yeah,
man,
it's,
it's a,
it's the biggest city.
Little Rock.
Little Rock.
Yeah.

2068
02:02:49.070 --> 02:02:52.950
But now actually probably a,
they've consolidated them into threes,

2069
02:02:53.260 --> 02:02:55.160
the three cities into one mega.

2070
02:02:55.310 --> 02:02:59.900
Megalopolis I go down there and do you work there?
I do concerts in little rock.

2071
02:02:59.901 --> 02:03:01.830
I want to,
I want to do one of the University of markets.

2072
02:03:01.870 --> 02:03:03.710
I'm a big razorback fan and um,

2073
02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:07.700
I love to do one back there because my first Gig I got to work with Sam
Kennison.

2074
02:03:07.701 --> 02:03:09.980
I want to,
when it was talent show contest is k hog.

2075
02:03:09.981 --> 02:03:12.890
The local radio station had a talent show contest.

2076
02:03:12.891 --> 02:03:16.630
He was playing the ballroom and I'm like 89.
No,

2077
02:03:16.670 --> 02:03:19.250
it makes me sad about comedy dude.
When I remember Houston.

2078
02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:21.260
Remember what Houston was like?
Yeah.

2079
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:24.020
I want to remember what it was like when I first started going there.

2080
02:03:24.110 --> 02:03:29.110
When that fucking had open mic that would stop and they would start at seven and

2081
02:03:29.901 --> 02:03:32.220
go toe to toe and then never,

2082
02:03:32.221 --> 02:03:36.410
it never comedian repeated or if they did it was a sketch or something live and

2083
02:03:36.411 --> 02:03:39.940
the audience constantly came in and out and you're walking outside and smoking

2084
02:03:39.941 --> 02:03:42.290
weed and bag in the back of the room and talking shit.

2085
02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:46.010
And there was this comics there,
there was a lot of good crying,

2086
02:03:46.090 --> 02:03:51.020
there was a lot of experimental,
amazing,
smart should ethic of the town.

2087
02:03:51.021 --> 02:03:54.470
There was like one hacks in there and they all knew that.

2088
02:03:54.471 --> 02:03:58.250
Like Hicks came from there and Kennison came from this and heritage.
Yeah,

2089
02:03:58.251 --> 02:04:01.280
there was something there and that talented boy,
it just got extinguished.

2090
02:04:01.610 --> 02:04:04.250
It just got extinguished,
you know.
And I hear guys say,
Hey,

2091
02:04:04.251 --> 02:04:08.390
we're working out again.
We've got this going on again.
But man,
there's like that.

2092
02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:11.120
You don't hear about God's coming out of Houston anymore.
No,

2093
02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:14.570
not every coach to him out of there.
And there was a bunch of man,

2094
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:18.080
that's my favorite line in hers,
Iti.

2095
02:04:18.081 --> 02:04:21.050
Remember Brian Herzing I genius dude is funny as fuck.

2096
02:04:21.051 --> 02:04:25.790
And it just kind of like stopped drunk that quit comedy.
That ain't cool man.

2097
02:04:25.791 --> 02:04:26.391
It's weird.

2098
02:04:26.391 --> 02:04:30.210
It's like that place like how to a flower that was growing and then somewhere in

2099
02:04:30.211 --> 02:04:34.370
other clouds grow overhead and the flower fucking died right there.
Man.

2100
02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:36.470
I think comedy,
he was about to evolve from there.

2101
02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:38.490
There was wanting to set up is a bunch of places,

2102
02:04:38.491 --> 02:04:41.850
30 40 comedians come out of there and,
and,
and I'm,
I'm,

2103
02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:45.600
I'm only giving you like maybe 10 15% of the actual comedy community.

2104
02:04:45.930 --> 02:04:50.930
I mean there was one at open Mike that had literally over a hundred comics

2105
02:04:51.100 --> 02:04:55.430
before.
Okay.
And that not everybody got to go on it.
So the Improv there,

2106
02:04:55.431 --> 02:04:58.860
it's not doing it now.
They eight level and they don't,

2107
02:04:58.861 --> 02:05:02.520
they don't foster local talent and they don't have to clean man.

2108
02:05:02.550 --> 02:05:07.070
The last stop was dirty.
It was dirty and Marty paths running it.
It was just fun.

2109
02:05:08.110 --> 02:05:12.120
We're still place was chaos.
There was nuttiness to the extreme.

2110
02:05:12.330 --> 02:05:17.280
That's what you need.
The only way you get the real comedy to develop,
to do,

2111
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:20.700
especially developing competence,
there has to be chaos.

2112
02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:23.370
It has to be like the comedy store.
It has to be like,

2113
02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:27.420
like that place they get stifled.
If it doesn't,
like I didn't grow as a comedian.

2114
02:05:27.450 --> 02:05:29.610
I mean I grew to a certain level,
like I knew how to rock a room,

2115
02:05:29.611 --> 02:05:33.840
but I had to do it cleaner and I had,
and I was a product of my environment.
I,

2116
02:05:33.950 --> 02:05:38.310
I went up,
um,
a lot of times it,
me work in the last stop was maybe five,

2117
02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:41.310
six times a year,
you know,
as work goes.

2118
02:05:41.311 --> 02:05:45.510
But I would work out every weekend at this place called the comedy showcase and,

2119
02:05:45.511 --> 02:05:47.400
and um,
go freeway and few coy.

2120
02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:52.480
And it was owned by a very smooth,
I think you smoother than,
um,

2121
02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:56.590
it's probably one of the most smooth comedians I've ever seen as far as like an

2122
02:05:56.590 --> 02:05:59.040
hour ago in and out of subject.
Like it's just one conversation.

2123
02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:03.840
A guy named Danny Martinez and his club,
uh,
he taught comics,

2124
02:06:03.841 --> 02:06:07.680
like he would have a Wednesday through Sunday and you get 10,

2125
02:06:07.681 --> 02:06:10.890
15 minute spot.
And it was just a showcase club.

2126
02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:15.890
And then also I'd go and play the,
uh,
the,
the big black,
I mean the,
um,

2127
02:06:16.200 --> 02:06:20.880
uh,
the hip hop comedy stop up in a hotel black room.

2128
02:06:20.881 --> 02:06:24.180
And that's where I developed all these black Joel's cause that was the fucking

2129
02:06:24.181 --> 02:06:28.230
audience.
I mean that's all I had,
you know,
and,
and,
um,

2130
02:06:28.380 --> 02:06:29.580
and then I started meeting,
you know,

2131
02:06:29.581 --> 02:06:32.370
I was surprised to have hanging around with Mexicans and black people.
All right.

2132
02:06:32.371 --> 02:06:34.740
And people go,
where did you get this fucking axe him from?
And where are you?

2133
02:06:34.741 --> 02:06:37.680
Why you talk like that?
And it's like,
well it was funny to the fucking crowd.

2134
02:06:37.681 --> 02:06:38.401
I was,
I was trying,

2135
02:06:38.401 --> 02:06:41.670
I was playing for what you're saying is there was a lot of different places to

2136
02:06:41.671 --> 02:06:46.590
go up there and he's so used to how to real interest in comedy dynamics when

2137
02:06:46.591 --> 02:06:49.920
that laugh stop closed down.
There really wasn't much there anymore.

2138
02:06:50.070 --> 02:06:55.070
It was even close.
Second Laugh stop.
But the second was not the same.
No,

2139
02:06:55.071 --> 02:06:58.140
no.
And before it even close,
it wasn't the same because when Babbitt left,
right.

2140
02:06:58.170 --> 02:07:03.150
And then,
uh,
homeboy,
Pete,
Pete came in,
he was a good guy.
Nice Guy,
Pete.

2141
02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:06.110
But Pete was like,
he was like,
oh,

2142
02:07:06.450 --> 02:07:10.140
straight up accountant sort of book writing sort of a guy.

2143
02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:13.700
And you need tradie Weirdos running comedy clubs.
Yeah,
yeah.

2144
02:07:13.701 --> 02:07:17.820
You need any guys like,
like our friend in San Francisco,
you know you need,

2145
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:20.650
and there's a guy in Seattle that,

2146
02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:25.270
that a couple of guys in Seattle that and our permission and I never come to

2147
02:07:25.290 --> 02:07:28.440
showcase in Ann Arbor.
No,
dude,
we had a good fucking time,
man.

2148
02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:32.000
I was there with Thompson girl.
Fucking great.
Hire that guy.
Straight.
A funny man.

2149
02:07:32.010 --> 02:07:34.930
A lot of people say he's really funny.
I don't even know that guy,
man.

2150
02:07:34.970 --> 02:07:36.520
I'm also going to follow them on Twitter.

2151
02:07:36.521 --> 02:07:39.790
Go see that guy in concert or wherever he's touring and he comes at me

2152
02:07:39.791 --> 02:07:44.410
someplaces he's fucking hilarious.
He's really,
really good.
He's really funny man.

2153
02:07:44.411 --> 02:07:47.920
It's a great guy to really,
everybody says he's phenomenal.
He's phenomenal.

2154
02:07:47.921 --> 02:07:50.920
And uh,
I got to Piss.
So I think this is a perfect time to end this podcast.

2155
02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:54.380
Great.
Shazamm southerners.
Nice guys.
Uh,

2156
02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:57.730
thank you very much for 200 and thank you fleshlight for sponsoring it.

2157
02:07:57.910 --> 02:08:02.230
If you go to Joe rogan.net,
you can get 50% off the fleshlight.
Um,

2158
02:08:02.910 --> 02:08:07.570
there's a code name Rogan.
You have to type it in the,
uh,
New Year's eve show.

2159
02:08:07.571 --> 02:08:10.960
We still don't have the ticket link as soon as I have it will go up.

2160
02:08:10.961 --> 02:08:12.280
Thank you very much for all the interest.

2161
02:08:12.281 --> 02:08:14.230
I keep getting a Twitter messages about it,

2162
02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:18.670
so it'll be me and Joey Diaz at the Mandalay Bay theater going to be the shit.

2163
02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:19.840
It's like 1700 people.

2164
02:08:19.841 --> 02:08:22.420
It's going to be a lot of it going to be such a grid time man.

2165
02:08:22.450 --> 02:08:26.440
If you want to no drama in Vegas and Vegas Ed for good new years is nothing but

2166
02:08:26.441 --> 02:08:27.274
fucking drama.

2167
02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:31.180
I you won't be able to leave your fucking hotel after a certain time to cut the

2168
02:08:31.181 --> 02:08:33.940
strip down and it's a forever fucking walk.

2169
02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:35.890
The smartest thing to do is have tickets.

2170
02:08:36.030 --> 02:08:39.310
All lay people would take it to a bail out to the fucking,
uh,
uh,

2171
02:08:39.311 --> 02:08:42.790
the barricades to get into the masses.
All right,
get you tickets.

2172
02:08:42.791 --> 02:08:46.450
I rarely buy him.
Go see a great show.
I highly recommend Joey.

2173
02:08:46.451 --> 02:08:50.740
Coco Diaz is possibly the funniest person I've ever been around and my life.

2174
02:08:50.770 --> 02:08:54.780
It makes me laugh more than anybody else ever.
And uh,
I,

2175
02:08:54.820 --> 02:08:58.570
the two of you together is just a fucking dynamic.
She's a real freak.

2176
02:08:58.960 --> 02:08:59.560
He's afraid.

2177
02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:02.080
Not a whole lot of real freaks out there is a lot of people fronting.

2178
02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:06.250
Pretend it'd be free walking around with a few hills,
different colors.

2179
02:09:06.910 --> 02:09:11.560
One converse all star that's red and one that's my ass curb.
I'm silly.

2180
02:09:11.710 --> 02:09:16.210
I go to hot topic.
I'm bad ass anyway.
That's it.
Thank you.

2181
02:09:16.211 --> 02:09:19.210
