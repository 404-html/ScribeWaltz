00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>but out of that lack of confidence that you get or that lack of sense of like</v>

3
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:07.110
<v Speaker 1>not everything's threatening,</v>

4
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:07.651
<v Speaker 1>not every,</v>

5
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>it's even like a roast.</v>

6
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I come not even good at roasts because I take things personally and if I'm going</v>

7
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:13.950
<v Speaker 1>to insult somebody,</v>

8
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.903
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

9
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.511
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

10
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:15.901
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

11
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm cutting to the bone.</v>

12
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not looking for the laugh.</v>

13
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten better at that.</v>

14
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

15
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.533
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

16
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I can take the hit a little better and I enjoy it.</v>

17
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:24.001
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

18
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's really hard if you're a competitive person,</v>

20
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:27.954
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Insecurity,</v>

21
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>you have no sense of healthy competition.</v>

22
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to want hanging around with you and everyone's going to think</v>

23
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>you're a Douche bag.</v>

24
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>And what you said is really important.</v>

25
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.260
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of threatens your self definition when you lose someone taking</v>

26
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.293
<v Speaker 1>something away,</v>

27
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

28
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>It your pride.</v>

29
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.811
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

30
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 1>you know your manlihood,</v>

31
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.761
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

32
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:45.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>like how other people are going to see you.</v>

34
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking like,</v>

35
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.351
<v Speaker 1>there was one time,</v>

36
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 1>this is rock and roll oriented,</v>

37
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

38
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.480
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a funny story in,</v>

39
00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>in this that there's a real difference between judging yourself against other</v>

40
00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:59.130
<v Speaker 1>people and,</v>

41
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>and just judging yourself against your own work.</v>

42
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.251
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

43
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard shift to make cause like a lot of my career was built on like how</v>

44
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>that fucking guy get that,</v>

45
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>why is that guy popular?</v>

46
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you get me to get,</v>

47
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.740
<v Speaker 1>why can't I be on that show?</v>

48
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.663
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

49
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.710
<v Speaker 1>As opposed to not realizing at that time.</v>

50
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I got all that stuff.</v>

51
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>A lot of my breaks early on,</v>

52
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>we're out of spite and looking back on it,</v>

53
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't ready for it and I,</v>

54
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>and I botched it just because like I had no,</v>

55
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I was all about the competition,</v>

57
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>but there was this one time where,</v>

58
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>if I was at a music camp and,</v>

60
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:31.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>it was just basically my parents sent me to this camp and they let you smoke,</v>

62
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>it was great.</v>

63
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>I was like 14 and we could smoke cigarettes and play guitar all day.</v>

64
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

65
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>And then the final night,</v>

67
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.461
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

68
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:41.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:45.330
<v Speaker 1>there was a big performance where the people in the camp put together bands and</v>

70
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>stuff and uh,</v>

71
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:49.230
<v Speaker 1>and you perform for the whole camp in this big band shell.</v>

72
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 1>So of course I ended up with these fucking stoners and shit heads,</v>

73
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>and we're just like the guy I had played bass,</v>

75
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:56.551
<v Speaker 1>he was okay.</v>

76
00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:57.271
<v Speaker 1>Long haired dude,</v>

77
00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>they're all troubled guys.</v>

78
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 1>And a while we wanted to do is play some chuck berry songs.</v>

79
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

80
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>I figured how hard could Johnny be good be,</v>

81
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>how hard we should be able to pull that off,</v>

83
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

84
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>And we're all,</v>

85
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>1415 years old and then there's this other crew of kids that were complete</v>

87
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>fucking music nerds that like new fucking how to read music.</v>

88
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 1>And that could play better than any of us in.</v>

89
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.230
<v Speaker 1>So here's what happens.</v>

90
00:02:18.231 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>So we go on and all the dudes I'm with get fucked up before we go on stage,</v>

91
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>which is doing Johnny be good man.</v>

92
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.871
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

93
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>it should be easy.</v>

94
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>It's three courts.</v>

95
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>My drummer's too fucked up to play drums.</v>

96
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>The guy on piano is not playing in the right key and it was a disaster.</v>

97
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I started singing out of key.</v>

98
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>It was the most shameful and embarrassing fucking thing.</v>

99
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I might as well just shit my pants on stage and then we get off and those other</v>

100
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>guys get up there and in my memory they played the entire side of a genesis</v>

101
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>album.</v>

102
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>That's my memory of it,</v>

103
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 1>that they got up there and they did some amazing thing and I felt fucking</v>

104
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:52.470
<v Speaker 1>invisible.</v>

105
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I felt ashamed and to,</v>

106
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>literally till maybe two years ago,</v>

108
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:56.640
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't fucking,</v>

109
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I was afraid to sing in front of people for half of my life</v>

110
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 2>because of that.</v>

111
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.871
<v Speaker 2>And if I just,</v>

112
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:02.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

113
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 2>put more thought into,</v>

114
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 2>making the song better and working with these dudes and just like learning how</v>

116
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 2>to do that shit,</v>

117
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have fucking,</v>

118
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird story and I don't know if it really applies,</v>

119
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 2>but I do know the feeling afterwards of embarrassment and shame and I felt that</v>

120
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 2>those guys had won and I fucking hated him for it.</v>

121
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 2>This in the Bible,</v>

122
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:21.874
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

123
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 2>that story as iron people sharpen people.</v>

124
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

125
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

126
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.361
<v Speaker 2>So what it is,</v>

127
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:28.571
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

128
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 2>you need to feel that.</v>

129
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 2>You need to feel lost in order to realize what you did wrong,</v>

130
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 2>but you can't live in it.</v>

131
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

132
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:33.881
<v Speaker 2>You can't live in it,</v>

133
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

134
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 2>it motivates you to move forward and it motivates you.</v>

135
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 2>But that terrible feeling shouldn't be ignored.</v>

136
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 2>It should be figured out.</v>

137
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like you got to figure out what,</v>

138
00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:42.101
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

139
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 2>what is causing this?</v>

140
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 2>But you can lock into that feeling for many years.</v>

141
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 2>Like all the crazy like,</v>

142
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

143
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 2>the cargo cults co what's the cargo cult?</v>

144
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.323
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

145
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

146
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.900
<v Speaker 2>My favorite thing.</v>

147
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 2>Cargo.</v>

148
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

149
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.770
<v Speaker 2>the cargo look up cargo called does.</v>

150
00:03:57.771 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 2>I explained what it is.</v>

151
00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

152
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.530
<v Speaker 2>So Papua New Guinea was a staging point for the American army during World War</v>

153
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.630
<v Speaker 2>II and they cut these impossible,</v>

154
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

155
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 2>runways into the jungle.</v>

156
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

157
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

158
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.760
<v Speaker 2>but the people who were living there were like Bronze Age people.</v>

159
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 2>And so they saw these planes come out and then,</v>

160
00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:20.130
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

161
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

162
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 2>they would give them like spam and whatever.</v>

163
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.883
<v Speaker 2>Like stuff,</v>

164
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

165
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.623
<v Speaker 2>parachutes.</v>

166
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 2>And so then they left at the end of the war and they started a whole religion on</v>

167
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:31.211
<v Speaker 2>the plane.</v>

168
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 2>So they built these planes and they come in and they mimic the landing and they</v>

169
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 2>mimic the people coming out.</v>

170
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 2>And they still have the American uniforms and the,</v>

171
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

172
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 2>the tribesmen with like a bone through his nose.</v>

173
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 2>And if you like one dread,</v>

174
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:43.490
<v Speaker 2>we'll come out with like Chi,</v>

175
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 2>captain fucking Joe Adams,</v>

177
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:46.144
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

178
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 2>and then they'll,</v>

179
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 2>they'll bring like the law,</v>

180
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.843
<v Speaker 2>the empty cans,</v>

181
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.320
<v Speaker 2>cans of spam and shit.</v>

182
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 2>And they have these like planes made out of flowers that they pretend to launch</v>

183
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:54.761
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

184
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:55.594
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

185
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 2>this is the craziest fucking,</v>

186
00:04:56.981 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 2>just really watching religion did they made,</v>

187
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:02.930
<v Speaker 2>they made the religion because of the planes,</v>

188
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

189
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.220
<v Speaker 2>the beef 52 coming with supplies and the whole religion is like the plane is the</v>

190
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 2>vessel of God and the Captain Joe Abrams who comes out is that he's God.</v>

191
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 2>And then this right Giorgio sucralose,</v>

192
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 2>which spike his hair up and come in here and say,</v>

193
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.940
<v Speaker 2>is it possible that the reason why these things exist that we learned them from</v>

194
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:26.524
<v Speaker 2>aliens?</v>

195
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

196
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:31.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean it makes sense if,</v>

197
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 2>if you live to stone age life and a plane landed and gave you some spam,</v>

198
00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:37.210
<v Speaker 2>100%,</v>

199
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.460
<v Speaker 2>it would become folk lore.</v>

200
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 2>And it's gotta be so strange if I think they are they illiterate culture?</v>

201
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.590
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>

202
00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:45.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean yeah,</v>

203
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.100
<v Speaker 2>the cargo called they do,</v>

204
00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:51.840
<v Speaker 2>they do the whole religious thing through the reenacting that when the planes</v>

205
00:05:51.841 --> 00:05:52.674
<v Speaker 2>first landed.</v>

206
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.120
<v Speaker 2>But actually there's a thing now they are kind of littered now because these</v>

207
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 2>people in New Guinea who are fighting Exxon,</v>

208
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of oil there.</v>

209
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Exxon is trying to turn to um,</v>

210
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 2>exploit the oil and these uh,</v>

211
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 2>tear they,</v>

212
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

213
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.231
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

214
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:10.570
<v Speaker 2>everyone's going to get oil though.</v>

215
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 2>Cause if there's fucking oils and was going to get it,</v>

216
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.390
<v Speaker 2>but they have this trial,</v>

217
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 2>but they have this tribe now that's dressing as,</v>

218
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.433
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

219
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

220
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.620
<v Speaker 2>the gods,</v>

221
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.160
<v Speaker 2>the car,</v>

222
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.160
<v Speaker 2>the cargo co,</v>

223
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.240
<v Speaker 2>and they're attacking Exxon dressed as American servicemen from 1942.</v>

224
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 2>I think the whole theme of this is from American 1942 today.</v>

225
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:38.500
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

226
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

227
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 2>it's cool because they make big,</v>

228
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:41.540
<v Speaker 2>huge white helmets.</v>

229
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.703
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

230
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.573
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

231
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.260
<v Speaker 2>if you Google God,</v>

232
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:46.041
<v Speaker 2>that's Google,</v>

233
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:46.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

234
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Papua New Guinea versus Exxon.</v>

235
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 2>And you'll see the crazy outfits.</v>

236
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.123
<v Speaker 2>John's very,</v>

237
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't know as Bell Papau New Guinea.</v>

238
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.920
<v Speaker 2>He barely knows how spells is new.</v>

239
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.900
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty fucking interesting that there's a whole,</v>

240
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.920
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge country.</v>

241
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Patenting is massive.</v>

242
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.910
<v Speaker 2>And there's a whole like how big Texas sized?</v>

243
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>much bigger than Texas.</v>

246
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

247
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.150
<v Speaker 2>And you have a big,</v>

248
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 2>big country where like,</v>

249

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.460
<v Speaker 2>like huge pockets of it worship cargo from 1944.</v>

251
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

252

256
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.553
