00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.010
<v Speaker 2>North Korea has a constitution which is for display purposes only,</v>

3
00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:10.850
<v Speaker 2>but what really governs the country is the 10 commandments of Kim Il Sung,</v>

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.740
<v Speaker 2>and the 10th commandment is,</v>

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.731
<v Speaker 2>I forgot what it is,</v>

6
00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:14.061
<v Speaker 2>something there.</v>

7
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:16.940
<v Speaker 2>It's the revolution shall be continued through the generations until it's</v>

8
00:00:16.941 --> 00:00:17.421
<v Speaker 2>completed.</v>

9
00:00:17.421 --> 00:00:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Which means only a descendant of Kim Il Sung can be the leader.</v>

10
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.340
<v Speaker 2>So Kim Jong,</v>

11
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:23.630
<v Speaker 2>Il had three sons.</v>

12
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 2>The middle one is a sissy,</v>

13
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.360
<v Speaker 2>so he doesn't count.</v>

14
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 2>He's a sissy.</v>

15
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

16
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.840
<v Speaker 2>they said he's too much like a girl,</v>

17
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.980
<v Speaker 2>like that's all we know about him.</v>

18
00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:33.590
<v Speaker 2>And he's a big Eric Clapton for certain all.</v>

19
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy,</v>

20
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.223
<v Speaker 2>pictures of this guy.</v>

21
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.021
<v Speaker 2>There's some online.</v>

22
00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:37.460
<v Speaker 2>You sitting there with his shoes off.</v>

23
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 2>So the eldest son was Kim Jong Nam and the youngest was Kim Jong,</v>

24
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:47.600
<v Speaker 2>Il and Kim Jong Nam wanted to liberalize Kim Jong.</v>

25
00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:48.201
<v Speaker 2>Il Said No.</v>

26
00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:50.360
<v Speaker 2>So if Kim Jong UN is going to be replaced,</v>

27
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.050
<v Speaker 2>the only one who could have replaced him was his older brother Kim Jong Nam.</v>

28
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.430
<v Speaker 2>So if he's killed,</v>

29
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 2>that's an insurance policy.</v>

30
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

31
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.490
<v Speaker 2>So he killed him just to make sure that he wasn't overthrown.</v>

32
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 2>And he killed his sons to it.</v>

33
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.270
<v Speaker 2>Right now he killed his.</v>

34
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.020
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

35
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.520
<v Speaker 2>his aunt's husband.</v>

36
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.271
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

37
00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

38
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.330
<v Speaker 2>But she drove his,</v>

40
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.660
<v Speaker 2>her daughter to suicide.</v>

41
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 2>So there it's game of thrones,</v>

42
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.530
<v Speaker 2>inhuman six,</v>

43
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.871
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

44
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:15.560
<v Speaker 2>six stuff.</v>

45
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

46
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.390
<v Speaker 2>And they boast about.</v>

47
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:17.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

48
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.490
<v Speaker 2>when I was doing my research for the book,</v>

49
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 2>they don't hide.</v>

50
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.400
<v Speaker 2>They boast about all the stick shit they do.</v>

51
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Like North Korea was recently criticized by the UN for having concentration</v>

52
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:28.370
<v Speaker 2>camps and they literally said,</v>

53
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.950
<v Speaker 2>we don't use that term so we don't have any.</v>

54
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.660
<v Speaker 2>That was their response.</v>

55
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.620
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do about it?</v>

56
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>That's how I described the for the first and only time I ever smoked gust.</v>

57
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.511
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

58
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>You did that while I hung out with,</v>

59
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 1>when I was one of the neighborhoods I moved into doing this.</v>

60
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Is there a fucking gateway drug to dust and tell you as it's called Solos?</v>

61
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Did they go right from Diet Pepsi to dust?</v>

62
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:55.284
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

63
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Here's the.</v>

64
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Here's my story is I moved onto this street called independence avenue in in the</v>

65
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:00.901
<v Speaker 1>valley.</v>

66
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like West valley kind of Desoto Sherman way.</v>

67
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.740
<v Speaker 1>And it was heavily Latino neighborhood and like we moved in and it was cool.</v>

68
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:09.931
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

69
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:10.470
<v Speaker 1>like I lived at,</v>

70
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>I came friends with a lot of people,</v>

71
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:12.624
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

72
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.543
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

73
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>I went from like the end of elementary school into junior high,</v>

74
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>right in that era.</v>

75
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>So like once we hit the junior high,</v>

76
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>it's like a lot of the Mexican kids I was hanging out with,</v>

77
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:25.080
<v Speaker 1>started hanging out with you a little bit older Mexican kids and a lot of them</v>

78
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>were dealing in like kind of gang life over there.</v>

79
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

80
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.070
<v Speaker 1>it's just part of the way they get done.</v>

82
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

83
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of them like to fucking do dips,</v>

84
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>which is like a fucking sherm cigarette dipped into my fucking angel angel dust</v>

85
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>sounds.</v>

86
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>So healthy choice dudes out.</v>

87
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.840
<v Speaker 1>It's how I wound up with this,</v>

88
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>this little tattoo right here.</v>

89
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>First Tattoo I ever had in my life.</v>

90
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>This little three dots.</v>

91
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Normally it's supposed to be up here,</v>

92
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't in a gang.</v>

93
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

94
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.461
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

95
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>for some reason I was so fucked up.</v>

96
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:53.251
<v Speaker 1>This is what wound up.</v>

97
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:53.501
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

98
00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:54.950
<v Speaker 1>this represents what they called me,</v>

99
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:55.700
<v Speaker 1>veto loca.</v>

100
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like little three dots here,</v>

101
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's like that happened because I smoke because these dudes pass me the</v>

102
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>sherm.</v>

103
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really know what I was when I was like this bang and the literally the</v>

104
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 1>way you just described that time traveling,</v>

105
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>it was like I felt like if I thought of something to do by the time I was</v>

106
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>finished with the thought of thinking to do it,</v>

107
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I had already done it.</v>

108
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call my mom goodbye mom.</v>

109
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.053
<v Speaker 1>That kind of thing.</v>

110
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>It was like fucking nuts.</v>

111
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 1>I fucking never experienced anything like that.</v>

112
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified.</v>

113
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:26.824
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified.</v>

114
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.941
<v Speaker 1>Terrified.</v>

115
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what the fuck's going on.</v>

116
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

117
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.843
<v Speaker 1>It was almost like,</v>

118
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.980
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

119
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>They gave me a lot of feelings is if you remember the first Friday movie when</v>

120
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Chris Tucker reflects on like somebody snuck him a little piece of dust and he</v>

121
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>

122
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

123
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 1>I didn't lose my mind naked all that shit.</v>

124
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like I was the butt of a joke that night.</v>

125
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Like like somebody gave me some dust,</v>

126
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:47.051
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

127
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>let's watch fucking the white boy fucking trip on dust on it,</v>

128
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>but it made for a good story on Joe Rogan,</v>

129
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>so no,</v>

130
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.823
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

131
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.240
<v Speaker 3>You didn't have to sit there and say,</v>

132
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

133
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.140
<v Speaker 3>a hundred years from now they're going to lose people looking at our level of</v>

134
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.080
<v Speaker 3>knowledge and they'll be saying the same exact thing.</v>

135
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.790
<v Speaker 3>What do you think would be the Big One?</v>

136
00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:10.770
<v Speaker 3>Would you think it would be antidepressants?</v>

137
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:13.140
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it would be painkillers that they're handing out?</v>

138
00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:15.450
<v Speaker 3>What do you think would be the big one that people would be freaking out about</v>

139
00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:16.284
<v Speaker 3>today?</v>

140
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.560
<v Speaker 3>I think about what we think what we're doing now.</v>

141
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:20.010
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

142
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.010
<v Speaker 3>I think it's overwhelmingly good to be my God that that quaint,</v>

143
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.090
<v Speaker 3>medieval destructive belief they held onto them about human agency and freewill.</v>

144
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

145
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.240
<v Speaker 3>They punished people who had brains that couldn't regulate their own behavior.</v>

146
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.990
<v Speaker 3>They punished people who because of toxin exposure or stress during adolescence,</v>

147
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.170
<v Speaker 3>wound up with brains that couldn't control this or that a particular junctures</v>

148
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.870
<v Speaker 3>and they used words like justice back then.</v>

149
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.951
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

150
00:04:52.951 --> 00:04:55.110
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe the stuff they did,</v>

151
00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.590
<v Speaker 3>it was practically like gangs of Gordy peasants getting burning torches and</v>

152
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:05.340
<v Speaker 3>going and burning down to whatever's around the medieval castle in terms of</v>

153
00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:07.530
<v Speaker 3>senses of the word justice,</v>

154
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:11.160
<v Speaker 3>applying to what biology has to do with behavior.</v>

155
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 3>There's so few people that share this idea that you're having,</v>

156
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.140
<v Speaker 3>obviously your sense of it is so much more educated and the average person and</v>

157
00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:23.310
<v Speaker 3>you understand all the mechanisms behind all of these particular behavioral</v>

158
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.940
<v Speaker 3>problems that people have and all these different things can affect the way</v>

159
00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:28.110
<v Speaker 3>human beings operate,</v>

160
00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:30.810
<v Speaker 3>but most people are not aware of this.</v>

161
00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:33.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean literally most people like if you had a guest,</v>

162
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.750
<v Speaker 3>if it's.</v>

163
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.100
<v Speaker 3>It might be in the 90 percent of people haven't really considered all the</v>

164
00:05:38.101 --> 00:05:42.540
<v Speaker 3>factors that lead to someone having a brain that would put them in these</v>

165
00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:44.370
<v Speaker 3>impulsive decision.</v>

166
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.650
<v Speaker 3>Terrible decision making situations.</v>

167
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.841
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

168
00:05:47.841 --> 00:05:52.841
<v Speaker 3>what's what gives me a little bit of sort of optimism is most people though,</v>

169
00:05:52.971 --> 00:05:54.050
<v Speaker 3>at least in the West,</v>

170
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 3>have done that in a couple of realms like 500 years ago.</v>

171
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.490
<v Speaker 3>If you had an epileptic seizure,</v>

172
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 3>the smartest,</v>

173
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 3>most reflective,</v>

174
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 3>most compassionate,</v>

175
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.810
<v Speaker 3>like middle ages,</v>

176
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 3>bleeding heart liberals even would have had an explanation for what caused an</v>

177
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 3>epileptic seizure,</v>

178
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 3>which is you were demonically possessed and the therapeutic intervention whiston</v>

179
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 3>Bernie with the steak,</v>

180
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.170
<v Speaker 3>and now instead we're are a century or two into having a mindset where instead</v>

181
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 3>we make a biological statement,</v>

182
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

183
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 3>it's not him,</v>

184
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 3>it's his disease.</v>

185
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

186
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.050
<v Speaker 3>he's not demonically possessed these guts.</v>

187
00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Something screwy with potassium channels in his brain,</v>

188
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 3>unless he gets synchronized outbursts.</v>

189
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.510
<v Speaker 3>Every now and then he has a seizure disorder like it's taken us about 500 years</v>

190
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 3>to do that one to go from.</v>

191
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

192
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 3>a blast from this behavior where we know the intervention,</v>

193
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 3>which is to burn somebody at the state the same,</v>

194
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:51.890
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

195
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 3>it's a biological problem and we even recognize constraints with it.</v>

196
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:59.150
<v Speaker 3>If somebody has uncontrolled epilepsy that's treatment resistant,</v>

197
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.260
<v Speaker 3>they may not be able to get a driver's license,</v>

198
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.030
<v Speaker 3>but you don't sit there and say,</v>

199
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

200
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 3>let's have a burning of the trivers licenses and the epileptics.</v>

201
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:10.540
<v Speaker 3>It's about damn time they got,</v>

202
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.383
<v Speaker 3>but they were.</v>

203
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.081
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

204
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:17.081
<v Speaker 3>it's a realm where words like evil or soul or punishment or justice,</v>

205
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:18.380
<v Speaker 3>it's totally irrelevant.</v>

206
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

207
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.480
<v Speaker 3>it's a neurological disorder.</v>

208
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.510
<v Speaker 3>So it's only taken us about 500 years to get to that point.</v>

209
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:25.720
<v Speaker 3>So maybe you know,</v>

210
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 3>we've done that cognitive leap at least once.</v>

211
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.500
<v Speaker 4>Shit is going through under the city.</v>

212
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.350
<v Speaker 4>Every minute.</v>

213
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.740
<v Speaker 4>Comedy store has a bathroom,</v>

214
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:35.461
<v Speaker 4>there's a new bathroom.</v>

215
00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:36.294
<v Speaker 4>They just put it in.</v>

216
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.460
<v Speaker 4>It backed up last night.</v>

217
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.220
<v Speaker 4>They have old pipes and a new bathroom.</v>

218
00:07:41.221 --> 00:07:43.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what they did if they replace the pipes,</v>

219
00:07:43.111 --> 00:07:46.530
<v Speaker 4>but something went wrong and I walked by the bathroom last night.</v>

220
00:07:46.531 --> 00:07:46.891
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

221
00:07:46.891 --> 00:07:48.940
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is that</v>

222
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.030
<v Speaker 4>about the smell of shit outside of the water.</v>

223
00:07:54.031 --> 00:07:55.260
<v Speaker 4>That is just so.</v>

224
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:56.963
<v Speaker 4>So Chris,</v>

225
00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:58.710
<v Speaker 4>back to the dog thing.</v>

226
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.390
<v Speaker 4>This is my.</v>

227
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.120
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about our dogs like rolling and shit and stuff.</v>

228
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.490
<v Speaker 4>My cousin doug the other day,</v>

229
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.590
<v Speaker 4>they had people coming to paint the house and my cousin's wife told them,</v>

230
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.791
<v Speaker 4>hey listen,</v>

231
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:12.990
<v Speaker 4>you can use our bathroom.</v>

232
00:08:12.991 --> 00:08:13.824
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry about go.</v>

233
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.041
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

234
00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:15.000
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to go outside.</v>

235
00:08:15.001 --> 00:08:15.834
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>

236
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.520
<v Speaker 4>our bathroom is your bathroom.</v>

237
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.110
<v Speaker 4>But they didn't really speak English,</v>

238
00:08:19.111 --> 00:08:23.100
<v Speaker 4>they didn't really listen to her and some guy took a dump in the bushes.</v>

239
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.900
<v Speaker 4>The dog</v>

240
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.233
<v Speaker 4>rolled around.</v>

241
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.520
<v Speaker 4>He came running inside and she's like,</v>

242
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:30.773
<v Speaker 4>what is?</v>

243
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:31.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

244
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.390
<v Speaker 4>how did you get human shit on your head?</v>

245
00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:39.450
<v Speaker 4>How she knows it smelled different.</v>

246
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.380
<v Speaker 4>And then they went outside and looked and they're like,</v>

247
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:44.790
<v Speaker 4>you guys use our bathroom.</v>

248
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:45.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

249
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:45.930
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

250
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

251
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.773
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

252
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.700
<v Speaker 4>Look what I found.</v>

253
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.790
<v Speaker 4>These guys are great.</v>

254
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen these guys that sat there?</v>

255
00:08:58.501 --> 00:08:59.334
<v Speaker 4>So great.</v>

256
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.480
<v Speaker 4>Why does a dog water rolling?</v>

257
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.383
<v Speaker 4>Shit?</v>

258
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.360
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

259
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.070
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>

260
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:11.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what possesses it to think that.</v>

261
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:12.320
<v Speaker 4>That's a good move.</v>

262
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:14.910
<v Speaker 4>Just so happy.</v>

263
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.411
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>

264
00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:17.221
<v Speaker 4>I guess a role in this.</v>

265
00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:18.090
<v Speaker 4>No one's going to throw a ball.</v>

266
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:18.280
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

267
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.113
<v Speaker 4>rolling.</v>

268
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.243
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>

269
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.180
<v Speaker 4>Look what I found.</v>

270
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 4>Have you met these guys?</v>

271
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.273
<v Speaker 4>They're awesome.</v>

272
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.081
<v Speaker 4>They're shit.</v>

273
00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 4>Smells terrific.</v>
