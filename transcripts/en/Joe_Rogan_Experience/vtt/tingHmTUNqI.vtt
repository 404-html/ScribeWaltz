<v Speaker 1>How many movies have you made?</v>

12
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>A one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We've made one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your favorite one?</v>

17
00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:32.731
<v Speaker 1>Other than the one that's right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is definitely a favorite because </v>

18
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>you're promoting it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A sex drive.</v>

19
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Sex drive is the one that nobody knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

20
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.380
<v Speaker 1>This first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody knows about it.</v>

21
00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:43.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one of those movies that just </v>

22
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:43.381
<v Speaker 1>opened a.</v>

23
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:43.381
<v Speaker 1>nobody knew about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a,</v>

24
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:43.381
<v Speaker 1>it was a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fun movie.</v>

25
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we can change that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on itunes or Netflix.</v>

26
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Are James Marston's in it?</v>

28
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>This is the one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this one that you like when you made </v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking construction or whatever.</v>

31
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>

32
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was over after that.</v>

33
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Did you finance it or anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

34
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we made it.</v>

35
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.230
<v Speaker 1>We made it with summit pictures and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

36
00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.580
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was amazing.</v>

37
00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:07.720
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

38
00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:12.721
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in town trying to get a career </v>

39
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:12.721
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 1>trying to try and make things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were making a TV pilot at the time </v>

41
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.961
<v Speaker 1>which was living hell and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had gone out and pitch this idea </v>

42
00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:21.100
<v Speaker 1>to a bunch of places and nobody bought </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

43
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.750
<v Speaker 1>So then in the middle of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.560
<v Speaker 1>editing our pilot summit pictures called</v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

45
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really,</v>

46
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.730
<v Speaker 1>we keep thinking about that pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you guys be willing to write it?</v>

47
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

48
00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>I tell them I was really busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

49
00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:34.240
<v Speaker 1>tell him I'll write it if I can direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

50
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.550
<v Speaker 1>but I figured that would make them go </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

51
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.420
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

52
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.780
<v Speaker 1>And so we went in and we wrote it and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned it in and they green lit it.</v>

53
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>It was this crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just this crazy process where we </v>

54
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 1>got this movie greenlit and I think we </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote the draft,</v>

55
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:47.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in like a month,</v>

56
00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Speaker 1>and we turned it in and they loved it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they said about it's a,</v>

57
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:52.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a teen road trip movie.</v>

58
00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:54.490
<v Speaker 1>It's about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids that,</v>

59
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of in the early days of the,</v>

60
00:01:57.281 --> 00:02:02.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook and all that stuff and it </v>

61
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:02.281
<v Speaker 1>might've even been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

62
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:05.731
<v Speaker 1>I can never track the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might've even been like sort of my </v>

63
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:05.860
<v Speaker 1>space into facebook that era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was about a kid who meets a girl </v>

65
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>online and goes to lose his virginity </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

66
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>on a road trip.</v>

67
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.990
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is funny.</v>

68
00:02:13.991 --> 00:02:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meyerson's in it.</v>

69
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.460
<v Speaker 1>James Morrison and he was really funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Clark Duke and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had a good cast and there it is.</v>

71
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

72
00:02:21.671 --> 00:02:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

73
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.320
<v Speaker 1>but it was a really great experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really fun.</v>

74
00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:27.580
<v Speaker 1>And then we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

75
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>we tested it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did the test screenings and it just </v>

76
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

77
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.830
<v Speaker 1>it just in the studio got really </v>
<v Speaker 1>excited.</v>

78
00:02:32.831 --> 00:02:33.790
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

79
00:02:33.791 --> 00:02:38.791
<v Speaker 1>like I'm going to have a huge career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then movie came out and do not do </v>

80
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:39.250
<v Speaker 1>any business at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

81
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.710
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go back to Wisconsin and,</v>

82
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.540
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not have a career at all.</v>

83
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>So is it true that instant family you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hired Tom Because Bert Kreischer wasn't </v>

84
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.940
<v Speaker 1>available?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

85
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.490
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell me that man,</v>

86
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.750
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'd heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

87
00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:55.000
<v Speaker 1>and he was asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was asking for a lot of money,</v>

88
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:58.630
<v Speaker 1>a lot more within where it is lofty </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

89
00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark's gets,</v>

90
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I want double what they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't do it.</v>

91
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.510
<v Speaker 1>So this movie is based in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 1>in no small part on your own life </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

93
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 1>It is adopting an actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you adopted like a full family and three</v>

94
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>of them in children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how wild.</v>

95
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bold maneuver,</v>

96
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were the ages?</v>

97
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three and a year and a half.</v>

98
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>And Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the process?</v>

99
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it starts,</v>

100
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>and this is how it starts in the movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

101
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>My wife and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for years,</v>

102
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:40.441
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't making any money including </v>

103
00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 1>after I made sex drive and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

104
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't really feel like I could </v>

105
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.241
<v Speaker 1>afford to have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whenever we talk about it I just be </v>

106
00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:48.241
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

107
00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:48.440
<v Speaker 1>not there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

108
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.310
<v Speaker 1>and then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

109
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>when I felt like I was doing better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was starting to get a career together.</v>

110
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I just started to feel like I was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be one of those old dads,</v>

111
00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like by the time the kid was a teenager,</v>

112
00:03:58.151 --> 00:03:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't going to be able to play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

113
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 49 now.</v>

114
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.670
<v Speaker 1>I was 41 at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

115
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 1>so God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

116
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's depressing.</v>

117
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

118
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

119
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made this dumb joke to my wife.</v>

120
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

121
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:18.091
<v Speaker 1>why don't we just adopt a five-year-old?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be like I got started five years </v>

122
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>ago and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm right back in the game.</v>

123
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>that's actually a really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

125
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

126
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:25.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't mean anything by that.</v>

127
00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:26.700
<v Speaker 1>At all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

128
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.950
<v Speaker 1>and then she went to a website and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed me the website and then when I </v>

129
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 1>saw the website I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>

130
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:34.420
<v Speaker 1>you see these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see their faces,</v>

131
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>you start to learn a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

132
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>And we just started having conversations</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

133
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 1>it went from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now now I've got three kids and a movie.</v>

134
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 1>And they're all siblings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

135
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 1>So they're all came from one mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And would the,</v>

136
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.580
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did they get separated from the </v>

137
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.580
<v Speaker 1>family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

138
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a lot of details about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

139
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:55.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't really tell you,</v>

140
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:58.180
<v Speaker 1>a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not much.</v>

142
00:04:58.181 --> 00:04:59.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know that there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

143
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:04.591
<v Speaker 1>there were issues with drugs and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think there was some kind of a </v>

144
00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 1>fire at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all pretty,</v>

145
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.260
<v Speaker 1>pretty sketchy as far as what you hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've learned a lot about the kids </v>

146
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not that much about the situation.</v>

147
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.400
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what made you want to turn this into a </v>

148
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.401
<v Speaker 1>film?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I would imagine that's a very </v>

149
00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 1>personal experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

150
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was actually my writing partner,</v>

151
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:28.081
<v Speaker 1>John Morris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had been about three years </v>

152
00:05:28.081 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 1>into it at that point and the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it was a nightmare,</v>

153
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.300
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like epic,</v>

154
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.520
<v Speaker 1>bad decision.</v>

155
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Why did we ever do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

156
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:41.101
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really a nightmare for a short </v>

157
00:05:41.101 --> 00:05:43.051
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when it came online and we </v>

158
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:44.911
<v Speaker 1>became a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really became the best thing that </v>

159
00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:44.911
<v Speaker 1>ever happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

160
00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:48.931
<v Speaker 1>when John and I get together every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just talk about our lives a little </v>

161
00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:48.931
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we get started.</v>

162
00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:50.770
<v Speaker 1>So John had been hearing all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories and one day he just said,</v>

163
00:05:50.771 --> 00:05:55.771
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why we're not doing a movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this because nobody really knows </v>

164
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>how this works when you go into foster </v>
<v Speaker 1>care to adopt kids.</v>

165
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>So we started talking about it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was the conversation of whether it</v>

166
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 1>could be a comedy or not because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do.</v>

167
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 1>We make comedies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And John again was like,</v>

168
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>most of the stuff you've told me is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really funny.</v>

169
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 1>So not all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

170
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>but that's.</v>

171
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 1>And then we thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

172
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 1>we could approach this as a comedy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we might be able to get,</v>

173
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more general audience to get their,</v>

174
00:06:18.481 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 1>their interest in it that way because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll feel less scary because that's the</v>

175
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:28.211
<v Speaker 1>problem is that most movies that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>made on this topic just frightened </v>

176
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 1>people and they make people think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids are all,</v>

177
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.640
<v Speaker 1>are all damaged and reachable anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

178
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Do you worry that it'd be like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie 101 Dalmatians at a bunch of </v>

179
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.220
<v Speaker 1>people start getting foster kids now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>screw them up?</v>

180
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

181
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Well we were talking about top gun about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

182
00:06:41.641 --> 00:06:46.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember when top gun came out and </v>

183
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:46.641
<v Speaker 1>everybody joined the navy thinking they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to fly the plane.</v>

184
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Well when the color of money came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool halls boomed across the country.</v>

185
00:06:50.971 --> 00:06:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I made a giant impact on pool halls for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that one tom cruise movie.</v>

186
00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 1>And it's just really a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>just got scammed out of their fucking </v>

187
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.430
<v Speaker 1>pocket money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of that going on.</v>

188
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.300
<v Speaker 1>I think the crazy thing about this too </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that like on the set,</v>

189
00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:08.220
<v Speaker 1>you realize like when you were doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

190
00:07:08.221 --> 00:07:09.450
<v Speaker 1>you go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

191
00:07:09.451 --> 00:07:12.450
<v Speaker 1>I always thought of people who do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

192
00:07:12.451 --> 00:07:13.620
<v Speaker 1>they exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're like,</v>

193
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.080
<v Speaker 1>those are nameless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faceless angels.</v>

194
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.980
<v Speaker 1>They're not real people like you or like</v>
<v Speaker 1>do any of your friends at top.</v>

195
00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

196
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.790
<v Speaker 1>don't not friends like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are other people you know.</v>

197
00:07:23.791 --> 00:07:25.440
<v Speaker 1>And then you start like on the set there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

198
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people visiting or consulting and there </v>

199
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 1>would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

200
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they adopted are they run some foster </v>

201
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:33.981
<v Speaker 1>care thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're like,</v>

202
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:35.730
<v Speaker 1>oh this is actually something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people really do.</v>

203
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even like dudes on the crew that </v>

204
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 1>somebody would come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 1>who's in the electrical department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

206
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.550
<v Speaker 1>oh hey bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

207
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I adopted two kids by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're like really,</v>

208
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or hey,</v>

209
00:07:46.261 --> 00:07:47.970
<v Speaker 1>I got adopted when I was four years old.</v>

210
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.040
<v Speaker 1>He just would like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you see it now,</v>

211
00:07:50.041 --> 00:07:55.041
<v Speaker 1>everywhere people are hitting me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone hit me up yesterday like my </v>

212
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:57.090
<v Speaker 1>sister is adopting four siblings this </v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

213
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

214
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:03.460
<v Speaker 1>This is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like it's like something I don't </v>

215
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:03.460
<v Speaker 1>want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like when your friend gets a</v>

216
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.410
<v Speaker 1>car and then you start seeing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

217
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.720
<v Speaker 1>There's exactly like that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about that video that went </v>

218
00:08:12.121 --> 00:08:17.121
<v Speaker 1>around online of this little girl that </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that she's opening up a box and </v>

219
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:21.741
<v Speaker 1>there's something in it that tells her </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she's been adopted by these two </v>

220
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:22.620
<v Speaker 1>people that are with her and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

221
00:08:22.621 --> 00:08:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to not cry.</v>

222
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you have any heart at all and </v>

223
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.290
<v Speaker 1>you watch that little girl freakout and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's breaks you up.</v>

224
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I think that's almost the test as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you were talking about about how.</v>

225
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Because believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tested if you're a piece of shit or </v>

226
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.480
<v Speaker 1>when you watch that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should show that.</v>

227
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.060
<v Speaker 1>What's your reaction to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

228
00:08:45.061 --> 00:08:46.890
<v Speaker 1>you're a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sociopath.</v>

229
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

230
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean there that what you were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting at as far as,</v>

231
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.280
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that guy that like,</v>

232
00:08:53.281 --> 00:08:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel special or like any one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those sort of heart of gold angels,</v>

233
00:08:57.191 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a line that's in the movie where</v>

234
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:03.891
<v Speaker 1>mark just says that's the kind of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that volunteer when it's not even a </v>

235
00:09:03.891 --> 00:09:03.891
<v Speaker 1>holiday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't do that.</v>

236
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should probably tell the audience </v>

237
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 1>that I'm not staring in this movie right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now for people who know those people are</v>

238
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:10.570
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Tom Starts.</v>

239
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.610
<v Speaker 1>This is Mark Wahlberg movie for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>four and a half minutes.</v>

240
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.070
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Wahlberg.</v>

241
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Stars in the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

242
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of breaking it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was only probably like 90 minutes.</v>

243
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.650
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>

244
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 1>That's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably like seven scenes.</v>

245
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 1>That's good scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you've got a solid presence.</v>

246
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 1>You didn't make the poster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poster,</v>

247
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 1>the poster.</v>

<v Speaker 1>movie theaters in your and that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

253
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Cardboard cut out thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I always call it cardboard </v>

254
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.780
<v Speaker 1>cutout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Standee is the real.</v>

255
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.180
<v Speaker 1>The real term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the term in the industry?</v>

256
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.500
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an industry term.</v>

257
00:09:55.501 --> 00:09:57.420
<v Speaker 1>That's a real industry term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learned something today.</v>

258
00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you.</v>

259
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.470
<v Speaker 1>Because you were telling me this and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

260
00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:02.910
<v Speaker 1>he was about to tell me before you came </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

261
00:10:02.911 --> 00:10:07.911
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sounds like this could be pretty </v>

262
00:10:07.911 --> 00:10:09.321
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell me save it for the podcast </v>

263
00:10:09.321 --> 00:10:11.511
<v Speaker 1>that because he's done this is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>press sean's done for a film that he's </v>

264
00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:11.511
<v Speaker 1>put out that.</v>

265
00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Did you go under?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

266
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:15.690
<v Speaker 1>let's give you some advice on media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

267
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrible at it,</v>

268
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:21.990
<v Speaker 1>so there's that because I don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing when you direct a </v>

269
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.731
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially movies like the kind of </v>

270
00:10:25.731 --> 00:10:25.731
<v Speaker 1>movies that I make comedies and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

271
00:10:25.731 --> 00:10:29.840
<v Speaker 1>big broad comedies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't really care who directed </v>

272
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.140
<v Speaker 1>those movies and I'm good with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm totally good with that.</v>

273
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:36.170
<v Speaker 1>But what usually happens is the studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the director usually wants to be kind of</v>

274
00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.600
<v Speaker 1>a part of the campaign so the studio </v>
<v Speaker 1>will find,</v>

275
00:10:39.601 --> 00:10:44.601
<v Speaker 1>they'll sort of throw bones at u of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>press that you can do and I always tell </v>

276
00:10:44.601 --> 00:10:44.601
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

277
00:10:44.601 --> 00:10:45.270
<v Speaker 1>if I can be helpful in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me know.</v>

278
00:10:45.271 --> 00:10:50.271
<v Speaker 1>I'll do whatever you need me to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't throw many bones because I </v>

279
00:10:50.271 --> 00:10:52.851
<v Speaker 1>don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't need to do that to kind </v>

280
00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:55.970
<v Speaker 1>just pump up the ego of the director </v>
<v Speaker 1>that certain directors just really want </v>

281
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:56.100
<v Speaker 1>to be the next Quentin Terica.</v>

282
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine there's some directors </v>

283
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:01.320
<v Speaker 1>they really have to do it for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

284
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.120
<v Speaker 1>They don't want you to feel left out or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

285
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.010
<v Speaker 1>But by my first couple of movies I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

286
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to do this stuff.</v>

287
00:11:06.391 --> 00:11:11.391
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized I actually had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience where I was in this red </v>

288
00:11:11.391 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 1>carpet thing and they brought me up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this reporter and they said,</v>

289
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:17.930
<v Speaker 1>this is Shawn Andrews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He directed the movie and she had this </v>

290
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 1>big look on her face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she went and I was like,</v>

291
00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:19.560
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cool,</v>

292
00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:22.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So disappointed.</v>

293
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.670
<v Speaker 1>So disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when it sunk into me where I </v>

294
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.670
<v Speaker 1>was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

295
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.670
<v Speaker 1>they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't give it.</v>

296
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:29.790
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine with me.</v>

297
00:11:29.791 --> 00:11:34.791
<v Speaker 1>I'm good there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's such fame whores and those </v>

00:11:37.351 --> 00:11:41.520

<v Speaker 1>their life walking the carpet.</v>

<v Speaker 1>obviously doesn't happen to me.</v>

314
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.800
<v Speaker 1>That was flying into lax and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting off a red eye and I was so just </v>

<v Speaker 1>tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked like shit and that,</v>

316
00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:27.820

<v Speaker 1>these two guys come up and they just </v>

317
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:27.820
<v Speaker 1>were so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

318
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're Shawn Andrews.</v>

319
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

320
00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes I am on editors.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

322
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:37.350
<v Speaker 1>and so it takes me a second to realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought it was so weird because </v>

323
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.350
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was right after,</v>

324
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:42.181
<v Speaker 1>it was shortly after daddy's home and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like the biggest hit and they </v>

325
00:12:42.181 --> 00:12:42.610
<v Speaker 1>were asking me about horrible bosses too</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

326
00:12:42.611 --> 00:12:44.580
<v Speaker 1>why are they asking me about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all things.</v>

327
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:45.400
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

328
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:50.401
<v Speaker 1>because Jennifer Aniston's in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they want me to say something about </v>

329
00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:54.181
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Aniston and just see if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can catch me saying something crazy and </v>

330
00:12:54.181 --> 00:12:56.380
<v Speaker 1>looking for a soundbite slip or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something they're trying to do.</v>

331
00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

332
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.760
<v Speaker 1>And my wife is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was that?</v>

333
00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:01.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

334
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took me an hour to sort of trying to </v>

335
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:06.610
<v Speaker 1>make you click bait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

336
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting too is it's sort of </v>

337
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.070
<v Speaker 2>an impromptu interview that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

338
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone said,</v>

339
00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:14.130
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's name is Mike,</v>

<v Speaker 2>wants you to go to his house and he's </v>

341

<v Speaker 2>gonna film you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to ask you a wacky questions.</v>

342
00:13:20.511 --> 00:13:21.280
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

343
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.310
<v Speaker 2>but if Mike shows up at the baggage </v>
<v Speaker 2>claim and puts a camera in your face,</v>

344
00:13:26.311 --> 00:13:28.040

<v Speaker 2>That's how they get.</v>

348
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:38.490
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't do an interview with them </v>

349
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:38.490
<v Speaker 2>under any other circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of like,</v>

350
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.280
<v Speaker 2>one of the weird things that happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the Roseanne Barr things.</v>

351
00:13:41.281 --> 00:13:45.090
<v Speaker 2>Roseanne Barr when her show was canceled</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the controversy was going on.</v>

352
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.880
<v Speaker 2>She was supposed to do the podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it became a big news thing,</v>

353
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.110
<v Speaker 2>but because she put it on her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

354
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.050
<v Speaker 2>her twitter that I'm going to do it.</v>

355
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:56.280
<v Speaker 2>And we talked about it and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to show up at the podcast studio.</v>

356
00:13:56.281 --> 00:14:00.990
<v Speaker 2>So they had all these news people </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing outside the podcast studio with</v>

357
00:14:00.991 --> 00:14:05.991
<v Speaker 2>their microphones were out out in front </v>
<v Speaker 2>of where Joe Rogan does his podcast and </v>

358
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.940
<v Speaker 2>they thought for some reason just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're there,</v>

359
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.820
<v Speaker 2>people have to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here,</v>

360
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.520
<v Speaker 2>talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

361
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.390
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're made out of milk.</v>

362
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:20.510
<v Speaker 2>They're barely human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way they talk is the most boring </v>

363
00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.510
<v Speaker 2>version of an interview you'd ever get </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

364
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:26.820
<v Speaker 2>It's a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick little soundbite where they feel </v>

365
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:26.820
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're,</v>

366
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:26.850
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the camera's on,</v>

367
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.580
<v Speaker 2>I've got the microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

368
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.150
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they said,</v>

369
00:14:30.151 --> 00:14:31.230
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

370
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:36.450
<v Speaker 2>kw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck yourself once you to come in and </v>

371
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:36.450
<v Speaker 2>sit down for an interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

372
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:36.590
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>

373
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have anything to say.</v>

374
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll do all my talking on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

375
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.490
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

376
00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

377
00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.460
<v Speaker 1>and also if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm in the business,</v>

378
00:14:46.461 --> 00:14:51.461
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not somebody that does a tremendous </v>

379
00:14:51.461 --> 00:14:51.680
<v Speaker 1>amount of press or at least not until a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple weeks ago.</v>

380
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're not accustomed to that,</v>

381
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:59.230
<v Speaker 2>it's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird because somebody puts a </v>

382
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.230
<v Speaker 2>camera in your face because immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking like,</v>

383
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I just go,</v>

384
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.170
<v Speaker 2>you know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

385
00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't have time for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

386
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Then you're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just think like,</v>

387
00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:08.081
<v Speaker 2>I can't even walk away from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just feel like you're all of a </v>

388
00:15:08.081 --> 00:15:09.080
<v Speaker 2>sudden somebody throw a cage over you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not even asking you,</v>

389
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.090
<v Speaker 2>can I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just doing it.</v>

390
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:11.920
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey shawn.</v>

391
00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you a question,</v>

392
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Shawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's forced.</v>

393
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.350
<v Speaker 2>It's forced on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It puts you in a weird spot.</v>

394
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like all the sudden you're in your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're on your,</v>

395
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:25.690
<v Speaker 2>on your heels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because your instinct is to be </v>

396
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:25.690
<v Speaker 2>defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone could say you're.</v>

397
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:25.730
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your instinct is not going to be.</v>

398
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.490
<v Speaker 2>I'll give the most thoughtful answer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this because it's,</v>

399
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.920
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in the moment.</v>

400
00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:33.110
<v Speaker 2>Someone just dropped it on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now you're like,</v>

401
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.120
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

402
00:15:34.121 --> 00:15:39.121
<v Speaker 2>and your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your emotions might be kind of all over </v>

403
00:15:39.121 --> 00:15:39.580
<v Speaker 2>the place and you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not stopping to like,</v>

404
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.680
<v Speaker 2>like having a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just sort of trying to figure </v>

405
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.041
<v Speaker 2>your way out of it and how many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have ruined their careers or lives on </v>

406
00:15:48.041 --> 00:15:50.890
<v Speaker 2>those things just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fucked up and said one,</v>

407
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.480
<v Speaker 2>they're just trying to be funny or just </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing,</v>

408
00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:56.300
<v Speaker 2>because they'll miss mutated and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they get ya,</v>

409
00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:57.860
<v Speaker 2>and then they put it up and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

410
00:15:57.861 --> 00:16:00.650
<v Speaker 2>why did I think through that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was coming home from the airport.</v>

411
00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:01.820
<v Speaker 2>I was tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was jet lagged.</v>

412
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Bordain got a shitload of death threats </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he said they asked him if you </v>

413
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:10.670
<v Speaker 2>had to serve dinner to Kim Jong Un and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump,</v>

414
00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:11.330
<v Speaker 2>what would you serve?</v>

415
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.970
<v Speaker 2>You said Hemlock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's trying to be funny,</v>

416
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.420
<v Speaker 2>and then you all these mega fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>morons protestors were there.</v>

417
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:22.700
<v Speaker 2>They were all sending these tweets like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Potus,</v>

418
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:27.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's threatening potus and it was so </v>

419
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:27.830
<v Speaker 2>strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

420
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:28.700
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is the NFL?</v>

421
00:16:28.701 --> 00:16:30.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the secret service?</v>

422
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.930
<v Speaker 2>They should lock this motherfucker up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

423
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.720
<v Speaker 2>you guys are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a joke.</v>

424
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.600
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing right there is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>click bait articles are they all make it</v>

425
00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:43.610
<v Speaker 2>so it'll say like so and so said this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they make it sound like somebody </v>

426
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:44.510
<v Speaker 2>like called a press conference to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>something ridiculous.</v>

427
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:49.930
<v Speaker 2>And really it was like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be some offhand remark and then </v>

428
00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.360
<v Speaker 2>people out there that are judging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

429
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:56.410
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never have anybody walk up and put </v>

430
00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:56.410
<v Speaker 2>a camera in their face and they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

431
00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:56.410
<v Speaker 2>well I would never say anything like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

432
00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:57.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't know what you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

433
00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.900
<v Speaker 2>You're never in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bizarre.</v>

434
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.500
<v Speaker 2>It's very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bizarre.</v>

435
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:05.840
<v Speaker 2>So how many of these things did you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do to promote this film?</v>

436
00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:10.841
<v Speaker 2>Because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of this film was based in large </v>

437
00:17:10.841 --> 00:17:15.311
<v Speaker 2>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On your actual life experiences of </v>

438
00:17:15.311 --> 00:17:15.530
<v Speaker 2>adopting these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of these things did you have to</v>

439
00:17:15.531 --> 00:17:19.370
<v Speaker 2>wind up doing a lot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I did,</v>

440
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:24.610
<v Speaker 2>we did our press junket in New York and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done junkets and usually I do like </v>

441
00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.360
<v Speaker 2>six or seven or 15 or whatever I did in </v>
<v Speaker 2>two days.</v>

442
00:17:26.361 --> 00:17:31.361
<v Speaker 2>I did like 90,</v>
<v Speaker 2>95 sort of the same questions keep </v>

443
00:17:31.361 --> 00:17:34.511
<v Speaker 2>coming back to over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start developing these canned </v>

444
00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:34.900
<v Speaker 2>responses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing you have to,</v>

445
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.060
<v Speaker 2>and this is a mistake and this gets back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what you were getting at before,</v>

446
00:17:38.061 --> 00:17:41.780
<v Speaker 2>is that when I would do press on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>movies in the past,</v>

447
00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:46.781
<v Speaker 2>I'd go to the junket and people would </v>
<v Speaker 2>come in and they didn't ask you more or </v>

448
00:17:46.781 --> 00:17:49.541
<v Speaker 2>less the same questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I always felt weird because I just </v>

449
00:17:49.541 --> 00:17:49.541
<v Speaker 2>felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

450
00:17:49.541 --> 00:17:49.541
<v Speaker 2>I just want to have a conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

451
00:17:49.541 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be like</v>

452
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.100
<v Speaker 1>this disingenuous guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would be sort of changing up </v>

453
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.851
<v Speaker 1>my answers and trying to kind of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially just made it boring and I </v>

454
00:17:58.851 --> 00:18:00.090
<v Speaker 1>wasn't really making any kind of a point</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

455
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

456
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.330
<v Speaker 1>on this one they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

457
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:08.331
<v Speaker 1>you've got a message with this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got things you want to get out </v>

458
00:18:08.331 --> 00:18:08.331
<v Speaker 1>with this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to learn how to do this.</v>

459
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.400
<v Speaker 1>So I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to like a day of media training </v>

460
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.110
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

461
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:20.300
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was the worst part was I've done </v>

462
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.350
<v Speaker 1>interviews and I've been fine before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got this guy sitting across from </v>

463
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:28.461
<v Speaker 1>me who's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>

00:18:31.161 --> 00:18:31.910
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

467
00:18:31.911 --> 00:18:33.120
<v Speaker 1>All the pressures there.</v>

468
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Who's teaching you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's teaching this training?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean they were really nice about it.</v>

472
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.670
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.840
<v Speaker 1>well there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some room for improvement.</v>

474
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

476
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.270
<v Speaker 1>it was the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will seem like a natural.</v>

477
00:18:51.271 --> 00:18:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is there to teach you?</v>

478
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Well now what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this,</v>

479
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.360
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing that I'm really </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with this with,</v>

480
00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:02.380
<v Speaker 1>with us just hanging out here talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is what I do is I yammer when </v>

481
00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a nervous talker.</v>

482
00:19:03.331 --> 00:19:05.400
<v Speaker 1>So you asked me a question if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous,</v>

483
00:19:05.401 --> 00:19:07.260
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of go and go and go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people are like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Geez us man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy talk.</v>

485
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.190

<v Speaker 1>really nice guy and he's The guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coaching me,</v>

487
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.820
<v Speaker 1>but I know I'm going to give you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake interviews.</v>

488
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd have a coach you first he gave me.</v>

489
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:31.220
<v Speaker 1>He gave me a lot of really good insights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the funny thing is every rule that </v>

490
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.250
<v Speaker 1>he's saying as he's saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

491
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do that.</v>

492
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything he's saying that I </v>

493
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:38.180
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

494
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:38.180
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

495
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.421
<v Speaker 1>I always do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is he saying you shouldn't be </v>

496
00:19:41.421 --> 00:19:41.421
<v Speaker 1>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that the main thing,</v>

497
00:19:41.421 --> 00:19:45.981
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda like what we were getting at </v>
<v Speaker 1>before that when somebody is setting a </v>

498
00:19:45.981 --> 00:19:48.921
<v Speaker 1>trap for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because so much of right now media </v>

499
00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:51.771
<v Speaker 1>training is just about don't go out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>get yourself into trouble by going in </v>

500
00:19:51.771 --> 00:19:53.630
<v Speaker 1>and just talking about some ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>area that.</v>

501
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what everybody's trying to do </v>

502
00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:58.640
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just as a.</v>

503
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.121
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a Time magazine interview about </v>

504
00:20:02.121 --> 00:20:03.330
<v Speaker 1>adoption about a year before we even </v>
<v Speaker 1>made the movie.</v>

505
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

506
00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:05.710
<v Speaker 1>And it was just because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

507
00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I was in the process of working on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie and anyway,</v>

508
00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.940
<v Speaker 1>so the whole thing was just about </v>
<v Speaker 1>adoption in my family and whatever.</v>

509
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:14.370
<v Speaker 1>And it was right when the Harvey </v>
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein stuff was blowing up.</v>

510
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.970
<v Speaker 1>So the lady's really nice interviewing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

511
00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.140
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

512
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.190
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

513
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.930
<v Speaker 1>since I'm talking to a Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 1>director,</v>

514
00:20:21.931 --> 00:20:25.590
<v Speaker 1>I'd be remiss if I didn't ask did you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about that Harvey Weinstein stuff?</v>

515
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.350
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>

516
00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.520
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't even think about my answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know,</v>

517
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know the guy was never around </v>
<v Speaker 1>any of it.</v>

518
00:20:33.061 --> 00:20:34.770
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of like more like fancy </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

519
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:35.820
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

520
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.380
<v Speaker 1>know I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

521
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.580
<v Speaker 1>I never met the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

522
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think anything of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got off the phone and then I thought,</v>

523
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't say,</v>

524
00:20:42.451 --> 00:20:44.190
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

525
00:20:44.191 --> 00:20:47.710
<v Speaker 1>did you know about that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

526
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:48.580
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew,</v>

527
00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:51.580
<v Speaker 1>but I kept it a secret fuck those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

528
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.110
<v Speaker 1>And I just thought right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

529
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.210
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

530
00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

531
00:20:56.741 --> 00:20:57.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sneaky.</v>

532
00:20:57.521 --> 00:21:00.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a sneaky way of asking to sneaky </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to get you to,</v>

533
00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.190
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

534
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know what,</v>

535
00:21:04.691 --> 00:21:07.240
<v Speaker 1>if you don't enter his kept his secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>for years.</v>

536
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm such a dumb shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have,</v>

537
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:15.030
<v Speaker 1>like you said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I think a year or two ago I </v>

538
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:15.070
<v Speaker 1>might have made a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

539
00:21:15.071 --> 00:21:15.910
<v Speaker 1>and been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

540
00:21:15.911 --> 00:21:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

541
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.460
<v Speaker 1>and just printing.</v>

542
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there.</v>

543
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.020
<v Speaker 1>And then I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

544
00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.590
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>

545
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:29.670
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it is just just to kind of </v>

546
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.340
<v Speaker 1>teach you how to just sort of stay on </v>
<v Speaker 1>point so that you don't get dragged down</v>

547
00:21:30.341 --> 00:21:32.920
<v Speaker 1>these weird roads into these things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

548
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.380
<v Speaker 1>that people are looking to get you in on</v>
<v Speaker 1>clickbait.</v>

549
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.680
<v Speaker 1>So did you bring up that instance when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you went through the training?</v>

550
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you say what should I have said?</v>

551
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.390
<v Speaker 1>I think I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think and,</v>

552
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.150
<v Speaker 1>and really what they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they teach you.</v>

553
00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:46.870
<v Speaker 1>It was funny because believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

554
00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you some clips of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

555
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.950
<v Speaker 1>sort of doing it right and doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

556
00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have disaster clips.</v>

557

<v Speaker 1>Actually I ref it's the same one because</v>

<v Speaker 1>the one that I saw was a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>threatening to kick the guy's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

572
00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.790
<v Speaker 1>The one that I saw didn't go that far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>

573

<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

581

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

608
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.460
<v Speaker 1>What did they teach you though?</v>

609
00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Like in that moment of like when they're</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like don't take the bait and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more than anything for me,</v>

612
00:23:57.831 --> 00:24:01.250
<v Speaker 1>because I look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Wisconsin and I still have that</v>

613
00:24:01.251 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's nice.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

615
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.600
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had this experience on my very </v>

616
00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.140
<v Speaker 1>first movie where I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to this reporter because it was</v>

617
00:24:12.141 --> 00:24:13.820
<v Speaker 1>a movie about a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a road trip,</v>

618
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:14.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

619
00:24:14.161 --> 00:24:16.100
<v Speaker 1>this silly road trip comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

620
00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.080
<v Speaker 1>and I talked to this reporter and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

621
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.360
<v Speaker 1>and he was just being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was being really cool.</v>

622
00:24:20.361 --> 00:24:23.560
<v Speaker 1>We were just kInda hanging out after </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing talking and he's like sit and</v>

623
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.470
<v Speaker 1>gas prices were really high and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

624
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:26.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

625
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.620
<v Speaker 1>you feel weird about making a road trip </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie when gas prices are so high.</v>

626
00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.420
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

627
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:32.280
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

628
00:24:32.281 --> 00:24:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

629
00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:37.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if the movie tanks I can just </v>

630
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.251
<v Speaker 1>blame it on that no one could afford to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the theater because the prices </v>

631
00:24:39.251 --> 00:24:42.161
<v Speaker 1>were so high and I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this article comes out that </v>

632
00:24:42.161 --> 00:24:44.270
<v Speaker 1>just the guy literally said I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>swarthy looking and it just,</v>

633
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.810
<v Speaker 1>he just painted me like an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of shit and I was like,</v>

634
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:52.990
<v Speaker 1>that guy was so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was like when we were talking </v>

635
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.500
<v Speaker 1>and then he just destroyed me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been there.</v>

636
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you guys have.</v>

637
00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all new to me.</v>

638
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.870
<v Speaker 1>I remember one too that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who did it to me,</v>

639
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:05.120
<v Speaker 1>like when I was just doing phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a phone interview for press before </v>

640
00:25:05.391 --> 00:25:10.391
<v Speaker 1>I was selling any tickets and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just like a really nice guy and </v>

641
00:25:10.391 --> 00:25:12.110
<v Speaker 1>totally twisted things.</v>

642
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:16.730
<v Speaker 1>And made it seem like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like he knOws what I was saying and</v>

643
00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:21.080
<v Speaker 1>he purposely twisted things around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it had no impact,</v>

644
00:25:21.081 --> 00:25:22.370
<v Speaker 1>but I remember reading that and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

645
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.450
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

646
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:29.210
<v Speaker 1>and be careful when you talk to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people because he totally,</v>

647
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.290
<v Speaker 1>he knows what I was trying to say and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>read this article.</v>

648
00:25:32.291 --> 00:25:34.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like he misRepresented everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

649
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the only way they can have </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

650
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:41.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're just a normal guy and </v>

651
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:41.900
<v Speaker 1>you give a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

652
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.760
<v Speaker 1>normal answers and you're thoughtful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>considerate,</v>

653
00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.610
<v Speaker 1>that's not as good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

654
00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.140
<v Speaker 1>It's so twisted around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's not just,</v>

655
00:25:48.141 --> 00:25:50.900
<v Speaker 1>it's not as profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more profitable.</v>

656
00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.600
<v Speaker 1>And especially if it's an online thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an online thing,</v>

657
00:25:53.601 --> 00:25:58.601
<v Speaker 1>you need to click bait title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a bunch of people clicking on </v>

658
00:25:58.601 --> 00:25:58.601
<v Speaker 1>that thing because otherwise you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get any ad revenue for it.</v>

659
00:25:58.601 --> 00:26:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very bizarre model where it's </v>

660
00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.190
<v Speaker 1>encouraging people to be deceptive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make these things inflammatory.</v>

661
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:08.660
<v Speaker 1>And I got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

662
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.620
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

663
00:26:09.621 --> 00:26:14.621
<v Speaker 1>I did 90,</v>
<v Speaker 1>95 interviews and in the course of two </v>

664
00:26:14.621 --> 00:26:16.370
<v Speaker 1>days and virtually everybody was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>

665
00:26:16.371 --> 00:26:19.190
<v Speaker 1>really asking really thoughtful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting question.</v>

666
00:26:19.191 --> 00:26:24.191
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to make it sound like </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ripping on tHe whole press over </v>

667
00:26:24.191 --> 00:26:24.191
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

668
00:26:24.191 --> 00:26:27.521
<v Speaker 1>there are these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing is that if it was </v>

669
00:26:27.521 --> 00:26:30.311
<v Speaker 1>every single person that came along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would almost be easier because you </v>

670
00:26:30.311 --> 00:26:30.311
<v Speaker 1>could just kind of be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

671
00:26:30.311 --> 00:26:30.950
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

672
00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:33.230
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get like 30,</v>

673
00:26:33.231 --> 00:26:34.710
<v Speaker 1>really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

674
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.490
<v Speaker 1>reporters with integrity and good </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

675
00:26:37.491 --> 00:26:39.410
<v Speaker 1>And then somebody jumps in and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

676
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.470
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then then,</v>

677
00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.200
<v Speaker 1>then they catch you not looking because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not looking for that guy there.</v>

678
00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Also get super</v>

679
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.330
<v Speaker 2>jaded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

680
00:26:45.331 --> 00:26:47.610
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like cops that have arrested</v>
<v Speaker 2>too many people.</v>

681
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:50.130
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's a crook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they just think that everybody that</v>

682
00:26:50.131 --> 00:26:55.131
<v Speaker 2>we're interviewing is a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also like they're interviewing </v>

683
00:26:55.131 --> 00:26:55.500
<v Speaker 2>these hollywood people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're thinking of you,</v>

684
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:57.690
<v Speaker 2>you had a big mansion and driving a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mercedes.</v>

685
00:26:57.691 --> 00:26:59.100
<v Speaker 2>You've got all this money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this guy,</v>

686
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.950
<v Speaker 2>it's like this instant take on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

687
00:27:01.951 --> 00:27:03.640
<v Speaker 2>a hollywood director.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

688
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's your casting couch?</v>

689
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ShIt.</v>

690
00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

691
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.420
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it becomes the game.</v>

692
00:27:09.421 --> 00:27:11.340
<v Speaker 2>I think too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for them the game is like,</v>

693
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.460
<v Speaker 2>let's see if I can get one and we should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be really clear.</v>

694
00:27:14.461 --> 00:27:16.050
<v Speaker 2>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people,</v>

695
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.170
<v Speaker 2>most people are nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just like one.</v>

696
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's only one out of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you run into that one.</v>

697
00:27:21.691 --> 00:27:22.950
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck these things.</v>

698
00:27:22.951 --> 00:27:24.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do those things anymore.</v>

699
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.570
<v Speaker 2>totally terrifying because you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about your family,</v>

700
00:27:27.571 --> 00:27:32.571
<v Speaker 2>your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like anybody who's going to cause now </v>

701
00:27:32.571 --> 00:27:32.571
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is this.</v>

702
00:27:32.571 --> 00:27:36.890
<v Speaker 2>I know you guys talked about this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is this culture out there where </v>

703
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.370
<v Speaker 2>people are completely reduced to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>one moment or one statement or whatever </v>

704
00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:45.441
<v Speaker 2>it is and that's all you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that whatever that thing that </v>

705
00:27:45.441 --> 00:27:46.050
<v Speaker 2>happened in that one moment and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

706
00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.880
<v Speaker 2>you see it happening to people all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and you think about so.</v>

707
00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:52.620
<v Speaker 2>So when you'Re there and you feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just a regular guy,</v>

708
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:57.621
<v Speaker 2>you don't feel like you know that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really scary because you think about </v>

709
00:27:57.621 --> 00:27:57.621
<v Speaker 2>your kids and you think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

710
00:27:57.621 --> 00:27:59.220
<v Speaker 2>so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a scary situation.</v>

711
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

712
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weirD time for these publications</v>

713
00:28:04.531 --> 00:28:09.531
<v Speaker 2>to be taken in consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's really buying magazines and </v>

714
00:28:10.021 --> 00:28:12.180
<v Speaker 2>newspapers like they used to.</v>

715
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:17.180
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to sell and so they're reduced</v>
<v Speaker 2>to these online publications and they </v>

716
00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:21.831
<v Speaker 2>have to compete with a bunch of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>click baity bullshit things and that's </v>

717
00:28:21.831 --> 00:28:22.170
<v Speaker 2>where the money is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

718
00:28:22.171 --> 00:28:23.580
<v Speaker 2>even in New York times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

719
00:28:23.581 --> 00:28:26.790
<v Speaker 2>the New York times is resulting to a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of click baity shit now.</v>

720
00:28:26.791 --> 00:28:27.720
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

721
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:32.930
<v Speaker 2>well do you guys have that feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're online that you're on </v>

722
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:33.750
<v Speaker 2>liquor clickbait diet where you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>things where you're like,</v>

723
00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.730
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally want to eat that right now,</v>

724
00:28:35.731 --> 00:28:40.731
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna do that ingredient in a </v>

725
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:45.210
<v Speaker 2>box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sweet to navigate it.</v>

726
00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Now you read that title and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this will have no substance.</v>

727
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:55.570
<v Speaker 2>just the headline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated to see where this goes </v>

728
00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:55.570
<v Speaker 2>because this didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

729
00:28:55.570 --> 00:29:00.430
<v Speaker 2>These online click baity things didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist 20 years ago and now they're </v>

730
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.430
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

731
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.070
<v Speaker 2>it's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's gonna happen in 10 years?</v>

732
00:29:02.071 --> 00:29:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's it going to be like,</v>

733
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.730
<v Speaker 2>where's this going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

734
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm very fascinated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

735
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:07.930
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fascinated to see.</v>

736
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:12.950
<v Speaker 2>It feels like a transitional time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel like it can Hold out </v>

737
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.950
<v Speaker 2>like this forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

738
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

739
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:14.790
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it hurts.</v>

740
00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

741
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:20.750
<v Speaker 2>this is the reason why I think podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture is coming on strong because it's</v>

742
00:29:20.881 --> 00:29:25.881
<v Speaker 2>a place where people just talk and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a conversation and I think that fear of </v>

743
00:29:25.881 --> 00:29:30.621
<v Speaker 2>slipping up and people always out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get you to slip up or </v>

744
00:29:30.621 --> 00:29:34.521
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has people not havIng as much of a free </v>

745
00:29:34.521 --> 00:29:35.940
<v Speaker 2>exchange of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but through these podcasts,</v>

746
00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:40.941
<v Speaker 2>one thing that does happen is people </v>
<v Speaker 2>will take a very small clip out of </v>

747
00:29:40.941 --> 00:29:44.361
<v Speaker 2>context and then write a whole article </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that small clip with a big click </v>

748
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:49.651
<v Speaker 2>baity headline like thompson sigora </v>
<v Speaker 2>shits all over people in Somalia and </v>

749
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.070
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

750
00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:51.850
<v Speaker 2>and then do that.</v>

751
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was a different city.</v>

752
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.560
<v Speaker 2>I just made something up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you know,</v>

753
00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:02.580
<v Speaker 2>it could be completely out of context </v>
<v Speaker 2>and over a giant overall discussion of a</v>

754
00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:09.530
<v Speaker 2>top of a topic that took place over 45 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes and they'll take 30 seconds of </v>

755
00:30:09.881 --> 00:30:13.710
<v Speaker 2>that and put a youtube clip up and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a bunch of angry people at you.</v>

756
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:18.870
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the other flip side of it is that I </v>

757
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.901
<v Speaker 2>feel like in this time we're developing </v>
<v Speaker 2>more of an audience that is quick to </v>

758
00:30:22.691 --> 00:30:27.691
<v Speaker 2>call that shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So while there are going to be people </v>

759
00:30:27.691 --> 00:30:27.691
<v Speaker 2>that take the bait and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

760
00:30:27.691 --> 00:30:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of people who are like </v>

761
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.430
<v Speaker 2>really quick to recognize that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken out of context.</v>

762
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because people like you and I and a</v>

763
00:30:35.711 --> 00:30:38.980
<v Speaker 2>lot of other people that do podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about that all the time.</v>

764
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.710
<v Speaker 2>So people hear it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they see the examples of it and you go,</v>

765
00:30:41.711 --> 00:30:42.940
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

766
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Some of it is so egregious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

767
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a piece of shit.</v>

768
00:30:46.631 --> 00:30:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Like someone should pull your license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you were a doctor,</v>

769
00:30:49.571 --> 00:30:52.620
<v Speaker 2>they'd fully pull your fucking license </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a journalist.</v>

770
00:30:52.621 --> 00:30:55.420
<v Speaker 2>He was a lot of wiggle room with p and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of shit.</v>

771
00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

772
00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these are journalists,</v>

773
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.300
<v Speaker 2>air quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these podcasts.</v>

774
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:06.330
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this medium is just going to grow and </v>

775
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.670
<v Speaker 2>people are embracing more this long form</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation and understanding things by</v>

776
00:31:10.061 --> 00:31:11.680
<v Speaker 2>talking about it for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

777
00:31:11.681 --> 00:31:15.520
<v Speaker 2>and the other part of it that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that gets lost sometimes is that,</v>

778
00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:20.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right now we're talking about like </v>

779
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.711
<v Speaker 2>journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the great journalists are just as </v>

780
00:31:22.711 --> 00:31:26.101
<v Speaker 2>hurt by this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This stUff is everyone because the </v>

781
00:31:26.101 --> 00:31:26.440
<v Speaker 2>people that are really out there being </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughtful,</v>

782
00:31:26.441 --> 00:31:29.410
<v Speaker 2>really researching their material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really talking to people,</v>

783
00:31:29.411 --> 00:31:30.820
<v Speaker 2>getting to the bottom of things.</v>

784
00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.630
<v Speaker 2>That whole journalistic work ethic that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we all grew up hearing about.</v>

785
00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:39.890
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people are just as threatened by </v>

786
00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.361
<v Speaker 2>this cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of attack journalism that </v>

787
00:31:42.361 --> 00:31:42.361
<v Speaker 2>happens because they can't even compete </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it,</v>

788
00:31:42.361 --> 00:31:44.080
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a really thoughtful,</v>

789
00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.470
<v Speaker 2>well researched story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then somebody like he touched a boob</v>

790
00:31:47.471 --> 00:31:49.330
<v Speaker 2>and then there's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get all the clicks.</v>

791
00:31:49.331 --> 00:31:54.331
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to matt taibbi who's a </v>

792
00:31:54.331 --> 00:31:57.361
<v Speaker 2>real journalist and matt taibbi was </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing the pieces that he wrote on </v>

793
00:31:57.361 --> 00:31:58.840
<v Speaker 2>wall street and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

794
00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:03.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crash of 2008 and all the fucking </v>

795
00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:07.801
<v Speaker 2>shenanigans that went on with that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how much just crazy shit they're allowed</v>

796
00:32:08.231 --> 00:32:10.780
<v Speaker 2>to do and what they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a ponzi scheme.</v>

797
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:15.700
<v Speaker 2>A loT of that 2008 crash was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you went,</v>

798
00:32:15.701 --> 00:32:20.701
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized he had put a year into </v>

799
00:32:20.701 --> 00:32:25.081
<v Speaker 2>research learning like he did not come </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a background in finance,</v>

800
00:32:25.181 --> 00:32:30.181
<v Speaker 2>so he put a year into researching all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the aspects of the savings and loan </v>

801
00:32:30.181 --> 00:32:34.921
<v Speaker 2>crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the aspects of the mortgage crisis </v>

802
00:32:34.921 --> 00:32:39.601
<v Speaker 2>and how it took place and how they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they were making money off of this </v>

803
00:32:39.601 --> 00:32:43.990
<v Speaker 2>and how they were betting on things </v>
<v Speaker 2>falling apart and moving money around </v>

804
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:47.000
<v Speaker 2>and how fucking chaotic it is and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy it is.</v>

805
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:52.120
<v Speaker 2>And then you think of how much time put </v>
<v Speaker 2>on that and then in proportion how few </v>

806
00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:56.531
<v Speaker 2>people actually read that and how little</v>
<v Speaker 2>it affected the actual economy itself.</v>

807
00:32:56.811 --> 00:33:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Like how little things changed and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>little people were outraged.</v>

808
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Like his article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you ever read the </v>

809
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.000

<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>

820
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.560
<v Speaker 2>you have to invest in something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

821
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:47.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

825
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:54.200
<v Speaker 2>it's like a kim kardashian got her butt </v>

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:05.290

831
00:34:06.111 --> 00:34:10.070
<v Speaker 2>kind of journalism that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about because I know that that when,</v>

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:04.590
<v Speaker 3>Her daughters were like grown daughters </v>

890
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:08.340

<v Speaker 3>but the story unravels the way,</v>

891
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.190
<v Speaker 3>like a good book or like a thriller </v>

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:36.400
<v Speaker 3>there's still</v>

926
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.020
<v Speaker 1>and there's some sort of a market for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for real,</v>

927
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:46.021
<v Speaker 1>it's actually real real stories and real</v>
<v Speaker 1>partners and I would say that that's </v>

928
00:38:46.021 --> 00:38:48.490
<v Speaker 1>what most of it is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that we get the so much of.</v>

929
00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's such a stock pile of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff every day,</v>

930
00:38:51.521 --> 00:38:54.010
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to the actual stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're reading,</v>

931
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm pollyanna about it,</v>

932
00:38:56.711 --> 00:38:59.080
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of great stuff out there.</v>

933
00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of great stuff.</v>

934
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Can you think about the actual amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>content versus hoW much time you </v>

935
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:06.610
<v Speaker 1>actually have to read?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is great stuff,</v>

936
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:11.500
<v Speaker 1>but if you looked at the overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 1>appetite that people have for media,</v>

937
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:16.770
<v Speaker 1>it's for nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was watching the wendy williams </v>

<v Speaker 1>like he should have won.</v>

943
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.260

1010
00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.810
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of good journalism is </v>
<v Speaker 1>plenty good writing.</v>

1011
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1012

<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1013
00:42:25.941 --> 00:42:27.900
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when when I was doing the,</v>

1014
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.110
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my limited experience in doing this,</v>

1015
00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:31.580
<v Speaker 1>the vast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vast,</v>

1016
00:42:31.581 --> 00:42:36.581
<v Speaker 1>vast majority of the people that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been talking to have been really </v>

1017
00:42:36.581 --> 00:42:36.830
<v Speaker 1>interested in just talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>adoption and really interested in foster</v>

1018
00:42:36.831 --> 00:42:38.720
<v Speaker 1>care and all that kind of stuff and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been great.</v>

00:42:38.721 --> 00:42:43.721
<v Speaker 1>It's been great talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to everYbody and I think that </v>

1020
00:42:43.721 --> 00:42:46.300
<v Speaker 1>when you have a topic like that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps because they're not really </v>

1021
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.781
<v Speaker 1>trying to crush you as much when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>know when you're talking to them about </v>

1022
00:42:49.781 --> 00:42:50.630
<v Speaker 1>kids who need families and homes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

1023
00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1024
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:52.130
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1025
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:57.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to be careful With letting </v>

1026
00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:57.280
<v Speaker 1>their piece of shit claws out.</v>

1027
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Now you said that your experience with </v>
<v Speaker 1>adopting three kids started out as a </v>

1028
00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.420
<v Speaker 1>nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1029
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.100
<v Speaker 1>How did it start out as it goes into it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1030
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:10.510
<v Speaker 1>do you have friends that joined the </v>
<v Speaker 1>military and where they,</v>

1031
00:43:10.511 --> 00:43:12.400
<v Speaker 1>they're in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think they're really tough and they</v>

1032
00:43:12.401 --> 00:43:12.900
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1033
00:43:12.901 --> 00:43:13.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be awesome.</v>

1034
00:43:13.761 --> 00:43:15.290
<v Speaker 1>And then they go to bootcamp and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1035
00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.030
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really hard.</v>

1036
00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.610
<v Speaker 1>And then they get on top of it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're good again,</v>

1037
00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:24.640
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they have to go through that </v>

1038
00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:24.640
<v Speaker 1>transition of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>

1039
00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:24.640
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm not as tough as I thought I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

1040
00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.510
<v Speaker 1>And then they get tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd never had any kids.</v>

1041
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I never had any kids dog eat dog thing </v>

1043
00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:35.820
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who said that to me.</v>

1044
00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.070
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I've had a dog.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Not compare the two.</v>

1047
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know we,</v>

1048
00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:47.080
<v Speaker 1>we went from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1049
00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:51.720
<v Speaker 1>zero kids and you kind of think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I babysat my sister's kids and that</v>

<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long that.</v>

1051
00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1052
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:56.180
<v Speaker 1>that's the movie I went to a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

1053
00:43:56.190 --> 00:44:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even what happens is you go.</v>

1054
00:44:00.771 --> 00:44:05.771
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for us we had a really interesting </v>

1055
00:44:05.771 --> 00:44:06.770
<v Speaker 1>experience where we went to an adoption </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair and that's,</v>

1056
00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.610
<v Speaker 1>that's in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real thing where they,</v>

1057
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.390
<v Speaker 1>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1058
00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:15.620
<v Speaker 1>their budgets are stretched so tight </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they'll have these outdoor events,</v>

1059
00:44:15.621 --> 00:44:18.440
<v Speaker 1>not every county has them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but la county has them where you,</v>

1060
00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:21.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they'll bring a bunch of kids that</v>

1061
00:44:21.171 --> 00:44:26.171
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are in the system and a bunch of a </v>

1062
00:44:26.171 --> 00:44:26.780
<v Speaker 1>prospective parents and they'll just </v>
<v Speaker 1>have like games and stuff going on.</v>

1063
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a really bizarre event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we went,</v>

1064
00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:31.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're there to meet kids,</v>

1065
00:44:31.651 --> 00:44:32.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to meet your kids.</v>

1066
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:37.730
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we went there and we didn't want to </v>

1067
00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:37.980
<v Speaker 1>have anything to do with teenagers </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that,</v>

1068
00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:43.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because we were scared we thought </v>

1069
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:43.020
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were not ready for that.</v>

1070
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:43.520
<v Speaker 1>We just want to find like some little </v>
<v Speaker 1>cute little kid,</v>

1071
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:44.280
<v Speaker 1>then we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1072
00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:45.290
<v Speaker 1>help out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1073
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:50.720
<v Speaker 1>and then the teenagers are all off to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the side because everybody is afraid of </v>

1074
00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.190
<v Speaker 1>him and it's the most heartbreaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you've ever seen because they know</v>

1075
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:58.191
<v Speaker 1>why they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they chose to be there and they </v>

1076
00:44:58.191 --> 00:44:59.250
<v Speaker 1>know that everybody's scared of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was there and I was like,</v>

1077
00:44:59.251 --> 00:45:01.020
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the worst thing I've ever seen.</v>

1078
00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:06.021
<v Speaker 1>And we ended up sort of inadvertently </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting this teenage girl and her </v>

1079
00:45:06.021 --> 00:45:10.610
<v Speaker 1>brother and sister and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just seemed cool and they just </v>

1080
00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:12.690
<v Speaker 1>seemed like really good kids and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>scared,</v>

1081
00:45:12.691 --> 00:45:13.440
<v Speaker 1>scared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scared.</v>

1082
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.600
<v Speaker 1>But we wrote them down on our sheet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just again,</v>

1083
00:45:15.601 --> 00:45:18.420
<v Speaker 1>not what we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we had planned on when we did this,</v>

1084
00:45:18.421 --> 00:45:23.421
<v Speaker 1>but we wrote them down on our sheet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we went home knowing they were going to </v>

1085
00:45:23.421 --> 00:45:23.421
<v Speaker 1>match us with them because no one else </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to put them down.</v>

1086
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.760
<v Speaker 1>And we get home and we find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1087
00:45:26.761 --> 00:45:28.290
<v Speaker 1>you've been matched with these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're like,</v>

1088
00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:29.250
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

1089
00:45:29.251 --> 00:45:30.600
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1090
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:33.540
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have a temperature a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were 16,</v>

1091
00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:35.790
<v Speaker 1>13 and 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1092
00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:38.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're,</v>

1093
00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:41.280
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of wrapping our heads around </v>
<v Speaker 1>this over the next couple of weeks.</v>

1094
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.530
<v Speaker 1>And we got to a place where we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1095
00:45:43.531 --> 00:45:44.480
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1096
00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:49.490
<v Speaker 1>we can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we got a call from the social </v>

1097
00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:49.490
<v Speaker 1>worker and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1098
00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:50.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to work out with them.</v>

1099
00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:50.910
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1100
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.010
<v Speaker 1>they've been in the system for four </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1101
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:58.310
<v Speaker 1>The girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's really holding out hope that her </v>

1102
00:45:58.310 --> 00:45:59.760
<v Speaker 1>mom is coming for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's refusing replacement.</v>

1103
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.930
<v Speaker 1>And so we tried to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1104
00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1105
00:46:04.951 --> 00:46:06.510
<v Speaker 1>when you hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

1106
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.790
<v Speaker 1>just the same reaction you guys just </v>
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>

1107
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:13.400
<v Speaker 1>So my wife and I wrote a letter to send </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the,</v>

1108
00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:15.480
<v Speaker 1>the social workers just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>

1109
00:46:15.481 --> 00:46:20.481
<v Speaker 1>we get it if you maybe you guys just </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to come and just do the foster </v>

1110
00:46:20.481 --> 00:46:21.660
<v Speaker 1>thing or you know however you want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1111
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:22.420
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1112
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:24.660
<v Speaker 1>we just sort of sent the letter off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't hear anything.</v>

1113
00:46:24.661 --> 00:46:26.010
<v Speaker 1>And then she came back and she just </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1114
00:46:26.011 --> 00:46:27.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not gonna happen.</v>

1115
00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.250
<v Speaker 1>And then she very matter of fact just </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1116
00:46:29.251 --> 00:46:34.251
<v Speaker 1>but there's these other three kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was kids are my kids now who I </v>

1117
00:46:34.251 --> 00:46:35.340
<v Speaker 1>love more than anything in the world.</v>

1118
00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:37.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how just,</v>

1119
00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:40.320
<v Speaker 1>there's these other three kids are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1120
00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.280
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

1121
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.410
<v Speaker 1>you want there to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I shouldn't say you.</v>

1122
00:46:43.411 --> 00:46:45.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted there to be a certain amount of</v>

1123
00:46:45.391 --> 00:46:48.210
<v Speaker 1>randomness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you have biological kids,</v>

1124
00:46:48.211 --> 00:46:51.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go into that,</v>

1125
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:55.530
<v Speaker 1>that event where you're sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting kids and if it feels weird.</v>

1126
00:46:55.531 --> 00:46:58.050
<v Speaker 1>And so when she said there's these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>three kids,</v>

1127
00:46:58.051 --> 00:46:58.680
<v Speaker 1>we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1128
00:46:58.681 --> 00:47:00.630
<v Speaker 1>And then they turned out to be younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1129
00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:03.320
<v Speaker 1>63 and 18 months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1130
00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:07.770
<v Speaker 1>but I never forgot meeting that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that girl and her brother and sister.</v>

1131
00:47:07.771 --> 00:47:09.650
<v Speaker 1>So when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the time came that we were going to</v>

1132
00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.130
<v Speaker 1>make a movie about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

1133
00:47:11.131 --> 00:47:13.170
<v Speaker 1>that was the genesis of the lizzie </v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

1134
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to make sure there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>teenager in this movie because they're </v>

1135
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.950
<v Speaker 1>so misunderstood.</v>

1136
00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:24.110
<v Speaker 1>And in the process I went out and met </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a bunch of families that had </v>

1137
00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:26.460
<v Speaker 1>adopted teen girls and then met with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of those girls who,</v>

1138
00:47:26.461 --> 00:47:28.680
<v Speaker 1>some of whom are grown up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of them are still,</v>

1139
00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:29.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1140
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:32.890
<v Speaker 1>with their families and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the thing,</v>

1141
00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:37.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scariness that we're all talking </v>

1142
00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.171
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone of these families that I met </v>

1143
00:47:40.171 --> 00:47:40.390
<v Speaker 1>with just great stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like amazing,</v>

1144
00:47:40.391 --> 00:47:41.950
<v Speaker 1>great stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hard times,</v>

1145
00:47:41.951 --> 00:47:42.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try it,</v>

1146
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:44.800
<v Speaker 1>trying to make that connection and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1147
00:47:44.801 --> 00:47:49.801
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody with the same story </v>

1148
00:47:49.801 --> 00:47:50.530
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have it any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Change our life for the better.</v>

1149
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Met these incredible kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1150
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:55.570
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1151
00:47:55.571 --> 00:47:56.870
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm yammering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

1152
00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1153
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.260

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1162
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:21.390
<v Speaker 1>it was a couple of weeks because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was weeks.</v>

1163
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.360
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1164
00:48:22.361 --> 00:48:23.650

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was [inaudible] they called and they </v>

1167
00:48:29.701 --> 00:48:29.701
<v Speaker 1>said we have these other three kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1168
00:48:29.701 --> 00:48:30.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there was going to be a meeting</v>

1169
00:48:30.551 --> 00:48:31.420
<v Speaker 1>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1170
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:35.560
<v Speaker 1>they won't tell you much about the kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>until,</v>

1171
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.460
<v Speaker 1>until they really sit down with you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they kind of walk through like,</v>

1172
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:39.370
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1174
00:48:40.961 --> 00:48:41.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>

1175
00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.570
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't fit in our case,</v>

1176
00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:49.050
<v Speaker 1>they don't have all the information </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously on their past and they can </v>

1177
00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:52.201
<v Speaker 1>kind of tell you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how they came into the and that </v>

1178
00:48:52.201 --> 00:48:52.201
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing.</v>

1179
00:48:52.201 --> 00:48:53.460
<v Speaker 1>So I wasn't able to go because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1180
00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.620
<v Speaker 1>I was at a work thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so my wife went to the meeting and I</v>

1181
00:48:56.621 --> 00:48:58.360
<v Speaker 1>was like listening to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1182
00:48:58.361 --> 00:49:00.010
<v Speaker 1>and that was on speakerphone in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting.</v>

1183
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:03.040
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was this one moment,</v>

1184
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:08.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's telling us everything and </v>

1185
00:49:08.041 --> 00:49:08.500
<v Speaker 1>there's this one moment where she slides</v>
<v Speaker 1>the picture across to my wife says,</v>

1186
00:49:08.501 --> 00:49:10.750
<v Speaker 1>here's a picture of them and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>this long pause.</v>

1187
00:49:10.751 --> 00:49:11.980
<v Speaker 1>And my wife goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1188
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:18.240
<v Speaker 1>they're cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they didn't sound cute by the </v>

1189
00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:18.240
<v Speaker 1>inflection in their voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1190
00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.830
<v Speaker 1>you're trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying not to be that guy,</v>

1191
00:49:20.831 --> 00:49:22.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they look like,</v>

1192
00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be shallow about it.</v>

1193
00:49:25.421 --> 00:49:30.421
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure kids are kids and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fall in love with them </v>

1194
00:49:30.421 --> 00:49:30.421
<v Speaker 1>regardless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1195
00:49:30.421 --> 00:49:31.720
<v Speaker 1>like you kinda everybody wants to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own kids are cute,</v>

1196
00:49:31.721 --> 00:49:31.990
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1197
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.540
<v Speaker 1>So it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when I saw the picture,</v>

1198
00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:39.541
<v Speaker 1>the picture was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just a weird bad picture of the </v>

1199
00:49:39.541 --> 00:49:39.541
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my son who was six at the time,</v>

1200
00:49:39.541 --> 00:49:41.650
<v Speaker 1>it looked like he was 11 and he looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

1201
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:43.750
<v Speaker 1>It was just the look on his face and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1202
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked hard at all and,</v>

1203
00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.960
<v Speaker 1>and we go over to the house and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids are adorable.</v>

1204
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.410
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1205
00:49:50.411 --> 00:49:51.970
<v Speaker 1>so this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry I'm getting ahead of myself.</v>

1206
00:49:51.971 --> 00:49:53.230
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you.</v>

1207
00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:54.880
<v Speaker 1>So we have the meeting and we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1208
00:49:54.881 --> 00:49:56.560
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go meet with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just to be clear,</v>

1209
00:49:56.561 --> 00:49:58.390
<v Speaker 1>we didn't say okay because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture,</v>

1210
00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:00.610
<v Speaker 1>because the picture was kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>neither here nor there,</v>

1211
00:50:00.611 --> 00:50:01.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just like,</v>

1212
00:50:01.391 --> 00:50:02.710
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go meet these kids.</v>

1213
00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:06.880
<v Speaker 1>So we go to the house and these kids are</v>
<v Speaker 1>adorable and,</v>

1214
00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:12.210
<v Speaker 1>and it's the weirdest thing ever because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to this foster home where they </v>

1215
00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:15.490
<v Speaker 1>live and you play with them for like two</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

1216
00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:19.810
<v Speaker 1>And when do you ever play with any kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>for two straight hours?</v>

1217
00:50:19.811 --> 00:50:23.980
<v Speaker 1>like actually actively play with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially kids you've never met before.</v>

1218
00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 1>So It's exhausting and it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we touch on this in the movie that I</v>

1219
00:50:29.181 --> 00:50:34.181
<v Speaker 1>was really scared when we were getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>there because I wanted so much to walk </v>

1220
00:50:34.181 --> 00:50:36.260
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See these kids well up with tears.</v>

1221
00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for real.</v>

1222
00:50:37.461 --> 00:50:38.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are my kids.</v>

1223
00:50:38.781 --> 00:50:41.390
<v Speaker 1>And just have that like cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection moment.</v>

1224
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:44.900
<v Speaker 1>And that didn't happen at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's more weird.</v>

1225
00:50:44.901 --> 00:50:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So were you,</v>

1226
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to live with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1227
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:53.770
<v Speaker 1>And well the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little kids are just kinda like </v>

1228
00:50:53.770 --> 00:50:53.770
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1229
00:50:53.770 --> 00:50:53.810
<v Speaker 1>it's actually weird in the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

1230
00:50:53.811 --> 00:50:57.680
<v Speaker 1>They're so used to kind of being passed </v>
<v Speaker 1>around that they're just kinda like,</v>

1231
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:58.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1232
00:50:58.161 --> 00:50:59.670
<v Speaker 1>who are these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1233
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:05.080
<v Speaker 1>and so we get in there and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foster mom in our case was like a go</v>

1234
00:51:05.181 --> 00:51:06.530
<v Speaker 1>to your mom and dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

1235
00:51:06.531 --> 00:51:07.200
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do this,</v>

1236
00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:12.640
<v Speaker 1>don't do that because it just felt so </v>
<v Speaker 1>obtrusive to the kids,</v>

1237
00:51:14.061 --> 00:51:14.300
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1238
00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:18.560
<v Speaker 1>And so we would go there every day for </v>
<v Speaker 1>five straight days.</v>

1239
00:51:18.561 --> 00:51:21.480
<v Speaker 1>We would go there when the kids were off</v>
<v Speaker 1>school and we'd,</v>

1240
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:26.650
<v Speaker 1>we'd go and play with them first in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>backyard and then you take them to the </v>

1241
00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:27.410
<v Speaker 1>park and then you take him to the park </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he'd take them out for ice cream and</v>

1242
00:51:27.411 --> 00:51:32.411
<v Speaker 1>you're just kinda like getting to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids that are strangers to try to </v>

1243
00:51:32.411 --> 00:51:32.411
<v Speaker 1>change their names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1244
00:51:32.411 --> 00:51:33.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>first day,</v>

1245
00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:37.580
<v Speaker 1>as soon as we walked in and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1246
00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:43.590
<v Speaker 1>we didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a little one wouldn't even know </v>

1247
00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:43.590
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1248
00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

1249
00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:44.960
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>

1250
00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:47.630
<v Speaker 1>No memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people do.</v>

1251
00:51:47.631 --> 00:51:49.400
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of kids,</v>

1252
00:51:49.401 --> 00:51:53.270
<v Speaker 1>a lot of older kids that sort of have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we'll want to change their name,</v>

1253
00:51:53.271 --> 00:51:55.370
<v Speaker 1>not just a new fresh start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1254
00:51:55.371 --> 00:51:56.750
<v Speaker 1>That they'll just want to.</v>

1255
00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1256
00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any experience with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've heard that,</v>

1257
00:52:00.801 --> 00:52:02.540
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes kids will choose to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1258
00:52:02.541 --> 00:52:07.541
<v Speaker 1>there was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a young lady that was at the screenIng </v>

1259
00:52:07.541 --> 00:52:10.061
<v Speaker 1>last night who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who her picture is at the end of the </v>

1260
00:52:10.061 --> 00:52:13.780
<v Speaker 1>movie and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's In Ireland getting her phd right </v>

1261
00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:13.820
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this girl that was adopted out of foster</v>

1262
00:52:13.821 --> 00:52:15.680
<v Speaker 1>care and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's amazing.</v>

1263
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.420
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>

1264
00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.920
<v Speaker 1>she had chosen to change her name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1265
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:24.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like it would mean something </v>

1266
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.950
<v Speaker 1>now that I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just seems,</v>

1267
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:25.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing a name.</v>

1268
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially as a teen,</v>

1269
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:30.350
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it if you're saying like,</v>

1270
00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:32.150
<v Speaker 1>I want to put everything in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1271
00:52:32.151 --> 00:52:35.090
<v Speaker 1>You want a fresh start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really lock it down.</v>

1272
00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:37.670
<v Speaker 1>This is the new me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My name's brian.</v>

1273
00:52:37.671 --> 00:52:39.350
<v Speaker 1>I used to be number eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tWenty four now.</v>

1274
00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that touches on something that is </v>

1275
00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:47.090
<v Speaker 1>really difficult when you're doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an adoptive parent,</v>

1276
00:52:47.091 --> 00:52:51.650
<v Speaker 1>is that you're trying to walk this line </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time where you know you,</v>

1277
00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:54.710
<v Speaker 1>you need to claIm these kids for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

1278
00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.840
<v Speaker 1>You need to be the person who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're with us like we're,</v>

1279
00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:58.910
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're with you.</v>

1280
00:52:58.911 --> 00:53:00.740
<v Speaker 1>We got your back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're behind you like you,</v>

1281
00:53:00.741 --> 00:53:02.210
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to do that.</v>

1282
00:53:02.211 --> 00:53:05.210
<v Speaker 1>That's what these kids don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing that we all take for granted.</v>

1283
00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:08.990
<v Speaker 1>We have these parents that love us no </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter what knucklehead things we do,</v>

1284
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:14.230
<v Speaker 1>so you're trying to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time you're trying not </v>

1285
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:16.571
<v Speaker 1>to impose your world on them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're coming into it with their own </v>

1286
00:53:16.571 --> 00:53:20.660
<v Speaker 1>personality and their own culture or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that behind them.</v>

1287
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:25.870
<v Speaker 1>So you're always trying to kind of be </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful and walk this line between just </v>

1288
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 1>just completely</v>

1289
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:31.160
<v Speaker 2>bring them in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not trying to change them into who </v>

1290
00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.190
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did thE six year old already have things</v>

1300
00:53:57.861 --> 00:53:59.430
<v Speaker 2>for me because I wasn't that kid at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's great for me because I'm like,</v>

1301
00:53:59.431 --> 00:54:02.850
<v Speaker 2>he's able to do the stuff that I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>so badly when I was little.</v>

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.950
<v Speaker 2>Violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were saying like there's a difference</v>

1313
00:54:28.951 --> 00:54:30.390
<v Speaker 2>between this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in football,</v>

1314
00:54:30.391 --> 00:54:33.000
<v Speaker 2>in that they're striking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each are allowed to.</v>

1315
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:34.710
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to hit each other with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stick,</v>

1316
00:54:34.711 --> 00:54:39.711

<v Speaker 2>with elbows to running in and they have </v>

1317
00:54:39.711 --> 00:54:44.091

1337
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:37.880
<v Speaker 2>My kids go to a very nice school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great school and we went to a </v>

<v Speaker 2>football game the other day where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>older kids are playing football and I'm </v>

<v Speaker 2>clip,</v>

1345
00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:55.310
<v Speaker 2>smashing it with Jordan falling to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and see the kid get up slow and </v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

1348
00:55:57.481 --> 00:56:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Like I felt like people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always felt like lacrosse because my,</v>

1349
00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:04.640
<v Speaker 2>my high school had lacrosse too and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>always felt like it was way crazier ones</v>

1350
00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:07.050
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm at the school and they have</v>

1351
00:56:07.051 --> 00:56:07.560
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1352
00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:11.360
<v Speaker 2>this shit is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they have stiffness.</v>

1353
00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're just,</v>

1354
00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.230
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1355
00:56:13.231 --> 00:56:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a football player,</v>

1356
00:56:14.521 --> 00:56:18.360
<v Speaker 2>you can become some herschel walker type</v>
<v Speaker 2>character and become a baller.</v>

1357
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

1358
00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:21.570
<v Speaker 2>But you got no shot if you're a lacrosse</v>
<v Speaker 2>player.</v>

1359
00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:23.590
<v Speaker 2>I love when they interview like all the </v>

1364
00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:36.271
<v Speaker 3>gonna be probably horrific at some point</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the impact of what you're </v>

<v Speaker 3>Guys.</v>

1371
00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:54.100
<v Speaker 3>One guy came out,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's happening.</v>

1376
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:03.370
<v Speaker 3>But there's still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>damage it.</v>

1379
00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:14.230
<v Speaker 3>That's how our brains work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our brains are designed to not have that</v>

1380
00:57:14.231 --> 00:57:16.240
<v Speaker 3>kind of foresight and you get much </v>
<v Speaker 3>older.</v>

1381
00:57:16.241 --> 00:57:21.241
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young satisfy me now and I don't know </v>

1382
00:57:21.241 --> 00:57:22.120
<v Speaker 3>what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can tell people,</v>

1383
00:57:22.121 --> 00:57:23.470
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is you're doing right now,</v>

1384
00:57:23.471 --> 00:57:26.950
<v Speaker 3>this is really good at causing </v>
<v Speaker 3>irreparable harm when like today.</v>

1385
00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:27.910
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well fuck it.</v>

1386
00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:28.330
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1387
00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:30.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the same way we deal with climate</v>

1388
00:57:30.201 --> 00:57:31.300
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1389
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Literally the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were driving around with cars </v>

1390
00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:36.670
<v Speaker 2>blowing smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

1391
00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:37.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day of every fucking fix it.</v>

1392
00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:42.850
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You tell someone to be a real problem </v>

1393
00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:42.860
<v Speaker 2>here on earth and like 300 years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1394
00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:44.400
<v Speaker 2>that sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever,</v>

1395
00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:46.850
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't be here bro.</v>

1396
00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Or even 40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sadly.</v>

1397
00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be like,</v>

1398
00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:55.180
<v Speaker 2>there's also the issue is people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a lot of head trauma that they get </v>

1399
00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:55.940
<v Speaker 2>very impulsive and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1400
00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:59.550
<v Speaker 2>they don't make good decisions anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if you know,</v>

1401
00:57:59.630 --> 00:58:03.080
<v Speaker 2>even if they could have the foresight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably would make good decisions.</v>

1402
00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:05.330
<v Speaker 2>They're don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not thinking rationally.</v>

1403
00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:08.420
<v Speaker 2>And they did some study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that study jamie?</v>

1404
00:58:08.421 --> 00:58:10.970
<v Speaker 2>We've referenced this before where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1405
00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:16.060
<v Speaker 2>they looked at kIds that play football </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally from pop warner all the way </v>

1406
00:58:17.031 --> 00:58:20.190
<v Speaker 2>through college and how many of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>have ct?</v>

1407
00:58:20.191 --> 00:58:21.680
<v Speaker 2>He really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1408
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:24.020
<v Speaker 2>jesus chrIst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stunning.</v>

1409
00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.190
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always felt like my,</v>

1410
00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:30.210
<v Speaker 3>my point of view on it was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played football fourth grade through </v>

1411
00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:30.900
<v Speaker 3>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1412
00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:33.610
<v Speaker 3>And I always just like men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you're so fucked up.</v>

1413
00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:34.300
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1414
00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:36.100
<v Speaker 3>but I just feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1415
00:58:36.101 --> 00:58:38.970
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you have definitely some big in a,</v>

1416
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:41.140
<v Speaker 3>in an amateur career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have some,</v>

1417
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:42.280
<v Speaker 3>you can think back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1418
00:58:42.281 --> 00:58:44.500
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got my bell rung a bell rung.</v>

1419
00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:47.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean probably,</v>

1420
00:58:47.321 --> 00:58:52.321
<v Speaker 3>I mean here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fourth grade and fifth grade you're </v>

1421
00:58:52.321 --> 00:58:52.321
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't happen really.</v>

1422
00:58:52.321 --> 00:58:52.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean kids were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1423
00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:55.420
<v Speaker 3>walking up and wrapping up slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1424
00:58:55.470 --> 00:59:00.470
<v Speaker 3>you're playing with kids who will </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually not play football even in </v>

1425
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:01.780
<v Speaker 3>sixth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it starts to be,</v>

1426
00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:07.020
<v Speaker 3>you might have like a stud on a team in </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle school and still a bunch of guys </v>

1427
00:59:07.061 --> 00:59:09.550
<v Speaker 3>that won't play in high school and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>high school.</v>

1428
00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely some uh,</v>

1429
00:59:12.731 --> 00:59:17.731
<v Speaker 3>athletes that stand out for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean those are the kids that will </v>

1430
00:59:17.731 --> 00:59:19.990
<v Speaker 3>eventually go on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you play teams are and there's weeks</v>

1431
00:59:19.991 --> 00:59:21.680
<v Speaker 3>where you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one is</v>

1432
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.630
<v Speaker 2>really good on this team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1433
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:27.080
<v Speaker 2>and you'll have a game where you'll feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1434
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:28.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was a couple of,</v>

1435
00:59:28.701 --> 00:59:33.701
<v Speaker 2>I've got a couple good hits and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was nothing really have impact and then </v>

1436
00:59:33.701 --> 00:59:37.301
<v Speaker 2>something will stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you'll play a school that has like </v>

1437
00:59:37.301 --> 00:59:37.340
<v Speaker 2>an allstate or all american player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1438
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:41.690
<v Speaker 2>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy fucking fucked me up bad.</v>

1439
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.340
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you remember it.</v>

1440
00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:48.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean I remember it to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of those like really standout guys </v>

1441
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:50.540
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hit stuck with me,</v>

1442
00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:53.510
<v Speaker 2>but that's once a year that you play </v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy,</v>

1443
00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:58.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or that you remember a school that good </v>

1444
00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:02.480
<v Speaker 2>and then if you don't go on to play in </v>
<v Speaker 2>college really feels like kind of a,</v>

1445
01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:04.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a risk assessment where you're like,</v>

1446
01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:07.230
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel like that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1447
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.180
<v Speaker 2>do I have damage?</v>

1448
01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:09.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

1449
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:15.010
<v Speaker 2>once you get into college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>football is where I feel like that's </v>

1450
01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.990
<v Speaker 2>where you're really playing with really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good athletes.</v>

1451
01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:19.940
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy in his neighborhood,</v>

1452
01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm a kid who was 21 committed suicide </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was a college player who was </v>

1453
01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:28.700
<v Speaker 2>about to go into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the pros.</v>

1454
01:00:28.701 --> 01:00:31.430
<v Speaker 2>He was 21 years old really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1455
01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:34.370
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>significant cte,</v>

1456
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.610
<v Speaker 2>like just really ravaged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1457
01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.800
<v Speaker 2>every year a player played tackle </v>
<v Speaker 2>football under the age,</v>

1458
01:00:39.801 --> 01:00:44.801
<v Speaker 2>predicted the early onset of cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems by two point four years in </v>

1459
01:00:44.801 --> 01:00:46.700
<v Speaker 2>behavioral and mood problems by two </v>
<v Speaker 2>point five years.</v>

1460
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:47.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a study.</v>

1461
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:53.270
<v Speaker 2>This is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our study found that 211 players who </v>

1462
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:56.230
<v Speaker 2>diagnosed with cte after death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who played tackle football before age </v>

1463
01:00:56.230 --> 01:01:00.251
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffered from cognitive behavioral and </v>

1464
01:01:00.251 --> 01:01:02.690
<v Speaker 2>mood symptoms earlier than those players</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't start to play till after age 12.</v>

1465
01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.390
<v Speaker 2>They're saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1466
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:10.450
<v Speaker 2>study included 246 former players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>211 of whom were diagnosed with cte </v>

1467
01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.550
<v Speaker 2>after death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

1468
01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Blinn college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1469
01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:19.810
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as getting around </v>

1470
01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:20.420
<v Speaker 2>real high impact hits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1471
01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.070
<v Speaker 2>Those are all people that know how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>

1472
01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:27.460
<v Speaker 2>They're all athletes getting rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're realizing now is that </v>

1473
01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:31.571
<v Speaker 2>subconcussive trauma is what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for the majority of brain </v>

1474
01:01:31.571 --> 01:01:33.200
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's subconcussive?</v>

1475
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:35.720
<v Speaker 2>You're not getting a concussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1476
01:01:35.721 --> 01:01:40.721
<v Speaker 2>You just get rattled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting rattled where it's not even </v>

1477
01:01:40.721 --> 01:01:40.721
<v Speaker 2>fucking you up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but over time,</v>

1478
01:01:40.721 --> 01:01:45.520
<v Speaker 2>over time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that over and multiple hits that are </v>

1479
01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.101
<v Speaker 2>just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not knocking you out that just </v>

1480
01:01:48.101 --> 01:01:48.101
<v Speaker 2>jostling you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can always happen a lot.</v>

1481
01:01:48.101 --> 01:01:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even get it from getting hit to the </v>

1482
01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:52.360
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1483
01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.320
<v Speaker 2>When you get hit to the body and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>head snaps back and you don't even get </v>

1484
01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.750
<v Speaker 2>hit in the head and you're like throwing</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and your head's all fucked up and you</v>

1485
01:01:56.751 --> 01:01:57.890
<v Speaker 2>try and figure out what's going on.</v>

1486
01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:01.160
<v Speaker 2>It's because your brain's been moshing </v>
<v Speaker 2>around inside of your head.</v>

1487
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that I remember too,</v>

1488
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:07.990
<v Speaker 2>the thing that stands out is when you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's such thing as like bracing </v>

1489
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.360
<v Speaker 2>for a hit and then feeling it and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1490
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:10.790
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you don't see someone coming.</v>

1491
01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:13.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like a fight.</v>

1492
01:02:13.281 --> 01:02:14.750
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see a punch comIng.</v>

1493
01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>

1494
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1495

1496
01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.790
<v Speaker 2>it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys are saving my child's life,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's funny because I,</v>

1499
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:28.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that much about lacrosse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to actually like youtube lacrosse </v>

1500
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:29.940
<v Speaker 2>to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you some of the video?</v>

1501
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:35.240
<v Speaker 2>Because there's some videos of some </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking hits that we were watching the </v>

1502
01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:35.240
<v Speaker 2>other day and brendan played lacrosse in</v>
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.040
<v Speaker 2>He played lacrosse in college and </v>
<v Speaker 2>football jesus,</v>

1504
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:40.950
<v Speaker 2>and then he fought in the ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so his brain looks like a walnut.</v>

1505
01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.660
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You talked to him.</v>

1506
01:02:42.661 --> 01:02:47.661
<v Speaker 2>You kind of know it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a crazy fucking sports.</v>

1507
01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.640
<v Speaker 2>People would watch these guys just over </v>
<v Speaker 2>and over again.</v>

1508
01:02:53.641 --> 01:02:56.680
<v Speaker 2>These guys getting code,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

1509
01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.860
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that?</v>

1510
01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're smashing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The impact is horrific.</v>

1511
01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:04.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

1512
01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:06.240
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are strikes.</v>

1513
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:08.490
<v Speaker 2>This is like me kicking somebody in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

1514
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:14.330
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not much different than a kick </v>

1515
01:03:14.330 --> 01:03:14.330
<v Speaker 2>in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just bring them with an elbow,</v>

1516
01:03:14.330 --> 01:03:16.890
<v Speaker 2>but the amount of force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these guys getting kicked in the head</v>

1517
01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:21.180
<v Speaker 2>with these helmets on and if you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>the helmet is protecting your head,</v>

1518
01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.640
<v Speaker 2>that shit ain't protecting anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

1519
01:03:23.641 --> 01:03:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

1520
01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:25.800
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1521
01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:29.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've thought for a long time.</v>

1522
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Hard helmets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got to just make it worse,</v>

1523
01:03:31.951 --> 01:03:32.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1524
01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:36.900
<v Speaker 2>it makes you more confident that you got</v>
<v Speaker 2>slammed your head into somebody and then</v>

1525
01:03:36.901 --> 01:03:39.930
<v Speaker 2>you don't realize how bad you're getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up from that.</v>

1526
01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.260
<v Speaker 2>You know it's your head when you get hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the head,</v>

1527
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:46.170
<v Speaker 2>even though you have a helmet on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to crack your skull,</v>

1528
01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.870
<v Speaker 2>your brain cells still subset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hitting you.</v>

1529
01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:55.050
<v Speaker 2>You get serious punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smashing around in there.</v>

1530
01:03:55.051 --> 01:03:58.090
<v Speaker 2>You're all the connective tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1531
01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:58.920
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's awful.</v>

1532
01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.170
<v Speaker 2>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

1533
01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.570
<v Speaker 2>And this is coming from a guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably seen.</v>

1534
01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:08.960
<v Speaker 2>I probably see more people get fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 2>than 99 point nine percent of the people</v>

1535
01:04:09.361 --> 01:04:12.900
<v Speaker 2>that have ever lived in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>being there live.</v>

1536
01:04:12.901 --> 01:04:14.670
<v Speaker 2>When someone got the fuck beat out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1537
01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:19.800
<v Speaker 2>I probably see more people get the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>beat out of him than almost anyone </v>

1538
01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:24.741
<v Speaker 2>that's ever lived in history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a small handful of people </v>

1539
01:04:24.741 --> 01:04:24.960
<v Speaker 2>that have seen more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1540
01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:26.910
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many fights have you called?</v>

1541
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.560
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thousands.</v>

1542
01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least more than a thousand.</v>

1543
01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Probably 2,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I've seen more.</v>

1544
01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a bunch of live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was competing I saw a bunch of </v>

1545
01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:39.320
<v Speaker 2>people get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>

1546
01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that when you can avoid that,</v>

1547
01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:45.050
<v Speaker 2>avoid it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1548
01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:47.560
<v Speaker 2>especially something like lacrosse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

1549
01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:49.190
<v Speaker 2>can't make a career out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1550
01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:54.200
<v Speaker 2>get out of there because they actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>just started because right now I'm used </v>

1551
01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.490
<v Speaker 2>to like kids soccer where they're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>running around chasing the ball.</v>

1552
01:04:56.491 --> 01:04:57.260
<v Speaker 2>It's cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

1553
01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.700
<v Speaker 2>It's fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1554

1555
01:05:04.701 --> 01:05:04.701
<v Speaker 2>play catch with the lacrosse stick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>

1556
01:05:04.701 --> 01:05:08.691
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a good time playing catch with </v>

1557
01:05:08.691 --> 01:05:08.691

<v Speaker 2>hit it with your head.</v>

1563
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Soccer are suffering from cte to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point where they're starting to minimize</v>

1564
01:05:22.091 --> 01:05:24.670
<v Speaker 2>the amount of heading they do in </v>
<v Speaker 2>practices.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>friend andrew marr where they would blow</v>
<v Speaker 2>open doors so they'd set up a charge on </v>

1571
01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:46.810
<v Speaker 2>a door and step back and break the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blow these guys.</v>

1573
01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:55.260
<v Speaker 2>nearby.</v>

1574
01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:58.771
<v Speaker 2>damage and it's just from the impact of </v>
<v Speaker 2>just getting shook by an explosion.</v>

1575
01:05:59.771 --> 01:06:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Not even anything actually hitting them </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the head.</v>

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.350
<v Speaker 2>no shit bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

1610
01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to tell you,</v>

1611
01:07:36.341 --> 01:07:40.300
<v Speaker 2>you guys are making me feel so good </v>
<v Speaker 2>about my mostly sedentary lifestyle that</v>

1612
01:07:40.301 --> 01:07:43.770
<v Speaker 2>I've lived my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's safer.</v>

1613
01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:49.250
<v Speaker 2>You're definitely don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't hit your head at this is coming </v>

1614
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:49.420
<v Speaker 2>from somebody who watches people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get their head hit for a living.</v>

1615
01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:55.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm feeling really good now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually I feel more ashamed for the way </v>

1616
01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:58.660
<v Speaker 2>that I've been conducting myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just when you can avoid it.</v>

1617
01:07:58.661 --> 01:07:59.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1618
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:04.200
<v Speaker 2>it's not a bad way to make a living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to be a fighter and you </v>

1619
01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.140
<v Speaker 2>really want to do it and that's your </v>
<v Speaker 2>drive,</v>

1620
01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:10.180
<v Speaker 2>that you should do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you should really learn how to </v>

1621
01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:10.630
<v Speaker 2>defend yourself correctly and learn the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right technique,</v>

1622
01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:16.080
<v Speaker 2>but when you're doing it for recreation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're doing something like the </v>

1623
01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.630
<v Speaker 2>cross where running at each other full </v>
<v Speaker 2>clip and smashing into each other,</v>

1624
01:08:17.631 --> 01:08:22.631
<v Speaker 2>and that's within the rules like I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're operating on ancient information.</v>

1625
01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:28.060
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most of these systems that </v>

1626
01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.011
<v Speaker 2>they're setting up most of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these sports rules and a lot of the </v>

1627
01:08:30.051 --> 01:08:33.620
<v Speaker 2>organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all operating on these old ideas</v>

1628
01:08:33.621 --> 01:08:38.621
<v Speaker 2>of brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm freaking out when I'm </v>

1629
01:08:38.621 --> 01:08:38.960
<v Speaker 2>going to this school football game and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching this,</v>

1630
01:08:38.961 --> 01:08:42.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is just brain damage and brain</v>

1631
01:08:42.381 --> 01:08:47.381
<v Speaker 2>damage and then watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's promoted by a school and school </v>

1632
01:08:47.381 --> 01:08:47.381
<v Speaker 2>pride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

1633
01:08:47.381 --> 01:08:47.900
<v Speaker 2>Everybody go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1634
01:08:47.901 --> 01:08:48.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1635
01:08:48.531 --> 01:08:50.240
<v Speaker 2>We're playing another team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's hope we beat them.</v>

1636
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:52.760
<v Speaker 2>How do you going to beat him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to fucking slam into them,</v>

1637
01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:56.060
<v Speaker 2>give them concussions and going to go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>school and they can't count.</v>

1638
01:08:56.090 --> 01:09:00.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you get blowback for talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff or from fans and that kind of</v>

1639
01:09:00.081 --> 01:09:00.680
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1640
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.830
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1641
01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:02.480
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1642
01:09:02.481 --> 01:09:03.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there must be some blow back.</v>

1643
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:06.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't read it anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's got to be true.</v>

1644
01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just too much evidence.</v>

1645
01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:14.800
<v Speaker 2>I just think you choose wisely choose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't not take risks.</v>

1646
01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:18.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you really want to be a bmx </v>
<v Speaker 2>rider or a professional skateboarder,</v>

1647
01:09:18.861 --> 01:09:23.861
<v Speaker 2>you're going to take some knocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just part of the part of the </v>

1648
01:09:23.861 --> 01:09:23.861
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't,</v>

1649
01:09:23.861 --> 01:09:25.580
<v Speaker 2>don't do it if you don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1650
01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:29.420
<v Speaker 2>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it piles up and there's no coming back.</v>

1651
01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:30.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

1652
01:09:30.921 --> 01:09:35.000
<v Speaker 2>when you go in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have like significant brain damage.</v>

1653
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:36.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get therapy,</v>

1654
01:09:36.501 --> 01:09:37.820
<v Speaker 2>they can help you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can,</v>

1655
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:39.170
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna,</v>

1656
01:09:39.171 --> 01:09:41.660
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna be a road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going down.</v>

1657
01:09:42.170 --> 01:09:43.160
<v Speaker 2>It's your brain.</v>

1658
01:09:43.330 --> 01:09:44.420
<v Speaker 3>I know they see the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

1659
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:49.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean hbo is actually tapped into it a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot with that real sports show for years</v>

1660
01:09:49.861 --> 01:09:54.861
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been doing follow up pieces on </v>

1661
01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:57.290
<v Speaker 3>cte and men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is devastating to see some of those </v>

1662
01:09:57.290 --> 01:10:02.091
<v Speaker 3>guests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys are like in their fifties or </v>

1663
01:10:02.091 --> 01:10:03.840
<v Speaker 3>sixties and they're not there at all.</v>

1664
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put a video up on instagram or on </v>

1665
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.581
<v Speaker 2>twitter or retweeted it and it's boxers </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it shows the boxers when they're </v>

1666
01:10:11.581 --> 01:10:16.351
<v Speaker 2>young and they're talking and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows them like at the end of their </v>

1667
01:10:16.351 --> 01:10:19.890
<v Speaker 2>career they're retiring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then In the interview them and you </v>

1668
01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:19.890
<v Speaker 2>see them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1669
01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:20.710
<v Speaker 2>just completely gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a shell</v>

1670
01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:25.830
<v Speaker 3>interview with riddIck bowe really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1671
01:10:25.831 --> 01:10:30.831
<v Speaker 3>it's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember even at this one was </v>

1672
01:10:30.831 --> 01:10:30.831
<v Speaker 3>actually kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was a james tony.</v>

1673
01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

1674
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:37.320
<v Speaker 3>Because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hE was,</v>

1675
01:10:37.321 --> 01:10:42.321
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was towards the end of his fighting </v>

1676
01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:43.110
<v Speaker 3>and he was definitely at least 40 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 3>overweight,</v>

1677
01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:48.230
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like really out of shape but still </v>

1678
01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:50.661
<v Speaker 3>throwing bombs and he was sparring and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like that piece that they air </v>

1679
01:10:50.761 --> 01:10:53.850
<v Speaker 3>right before the fighters go to the ring</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>

1680
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:58.910
<v Speaker 3>on fight night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean he's definitely taken some </v>

1681
01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:02.901
<v Speaker 3>shots and given some shots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was sparring and they were </v>

1682
01:11:02.901 --> 01:11:03.930
<v Speaker 3>throwing in fresh bodies for him to spar</v>
<v Speaker 3>against.</v>

1683
01:11:03.931 --> 01:11:05.510
<v Speaker 3>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1684
01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:07.530
<v Speaker 3>two mInutes with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then boom,</v>

1685
01:11:07.531 --> 01:11:12.531
<v Speaker 3>fresh body and as he's lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is like really hyperventilation spit </v>

1686
01:11:13.691 --> 01:11:13.890
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

1687
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:19.050
<v Speaker 1>he's still talking shit like at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he's fighting,</v>

1688
01:11:19.051 --> 01:11:24.051
<v Speaker 1>he's like blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just.</v>

1689
01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:27.990
<v Speaker 1>And then they bring in the guys like </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mom,</v>

1690
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.840
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a mess.</v>

1691
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.660
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a total mess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just like talking shit,</v>

1692
01:11:33.661 --> 01:11:38.661
<v Speaker 1>calling guys shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as he's barely making it through </v>

1693
01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:40.740
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sparring sessions and you know,</v>

1694
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:41.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needs.</v>

1695
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:43.260
<v Speaker 1>But he's one of those guys he had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1696
01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:45.060
<v Speaker 1>He had to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1697
01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.590
<v Speaker 1>especially towards the end of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

1698
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.780
<v Speaker 1>he took a fight in the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did?</v>

1699
01:11:48.781 --> 01:11:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1700
01:11:49.801 --> 01:11:52.980
<v Speaker 1>He's the only like real world champ</v>

1701
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000
<v Speaker 2>peon boxer that ever fought in mixed </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts and the ufc and randy </v>

1702
01:11:58.161 --> 01:12:00.290
<v Speaker 2>couture ankle picked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took him down,</v>

1703
01:12:00.291 --> 01:12:02.330
<v Speaker 2>strangled them right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1704
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:03.520
<v Speaker 2>It was easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1705
01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:07.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1706
01:12:07.271 --> 01:12:12.271
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think he really bothered </v>

1707
01:12:12.271 --> 01:12:13.781
<v Speaker 2>learning talking to tony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he just put the gloves on and </v>

1708
01:12:13.781 --> 01:12:16.070
<v Speaker 2>got In there and just had no idea what </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

1709
01:12:16.071 --> 01:12:19.520
<v Speaker 2>When randy got ahold of him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was clearly untrained when it came to</v>

1710
01:12:19.521 --> 01:12:22.040
<v Speaker 2>the gravity of this low ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low single.</v>

1711
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:24.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1712
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Randy just immediately mount some </v>
<v Speaker 2>punches him in the head a bunch of times</v>

1713
01:12:28.401 --> 01:12:32.870
<v Speaker 2>and then strangled them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>randy was just honestly being nice.</v>

1714
01:12:33.170 --> 01:12:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1715
01:12:33.741 --> 01:12:36.020
<v Speaker 2>He could have punished them a lot longer</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want it to.</v>

1716
01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:40.700
<v Speaker 2>He just wanted to finish them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was sad because it was just,</v>

1717
01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:42.180
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1718
01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:47.290
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about all these guys just</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to handle his hands and </v>

1719
01:12:47.290 --> 01:12:48.650
<v Speaker 2>every fight starts standing up and which</v>
<v Speaker 2>is true.</v>

1720
01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:53.650
<v Speaker 2>But randy coture will take you down all </v>
<v Speaker 2>day anytime he wants.</v>

1721
01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:56.300
<v Speaker 2>And then he got him in an arm triangle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just smushed them.</v>

1722

<v Speaker 2>something up.</v>

1725
01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:08.530
<v Speaker 2>That's what he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants his head tied down against the </v>

1726
01:13:08.530 --> 01:13:09.140
<v Speaker 2>side of his arm and he's going to squish</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It didn't know it wasn't that it that it</v>

1951
01:21:39.630 --> 01:21:42.330
<v Speaker 1>sucked that bad it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might've been.</v>

1952
01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:43.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no it wasn't.</v>

1953
01:21:43.810 --> 01:21:45.270
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just that you,</v>

1954
01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:50.280
<v Speaker 1>you have this very specific thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that I wanted to bring in and be </v>

1955
01:21:51.541 --> 01:21:53.760
<v Speaker 1>a part of this character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you left that out.</v>

1956
01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.050
<v Speaker 1>See I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think.</v>

1957
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:57.570
<v Speaker 1>What's that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's got this,</v>

1958
01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.780
<v Speaker 1>he's got this in his delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kind of devil may care.</v>

1959
01:22:00.781 --> 01:22:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Kind of like dead pan sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's this,</v>

1960
01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:04.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1961
01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:06.810
<v Speaker 1>it's like a big part of your persona is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole like,</v>

1962
01:22:06.811 --> 01:22:07.560
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1963
01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I just said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1964
01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:11.430
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted russ to have that thing.</v>

1965
01:22:11.431 --> 01:22:13.650
<v Speaker 1>And when you came into to audition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you left that thing out.</v>

1966
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I think I did that in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

1967
01:22:16.351 --> 01:22:17.400
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were great in the movie.</v>

1968
01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:22.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying I feel like I did the movie </v>

1969
01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:22.490
<v Speaker 1>exactly how I audition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1970
01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:25.320
<v Speaker 1>you didn't at all really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like night and day.</v>

1971
01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Night and day.</v>

1972
01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.690
<v Speaker 1>In my mind if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone were to ask me,</v>

1973
01:22:30.691 --> 01:22:35.691
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like 100 percent of the sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second audition you did just like </v>

1974
01:22:35.691 --> 01:22:35.730
<v Speaker 1>the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1975
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because basically so,</v>

1976
01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.770
<v Speaker 1>so then what happened is we got together</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought and I was like,</v>

1977
01:22:40.771 --> 01:22:45.771
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to meet him for the second </v>

1978
01:22:45.771 --> 01:22:45.771
<v Speaker 1>audition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then what?</v>

1979
01:22:45.771 --> 01:22:46.560
<v Speaker 1>We got together because I called them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I really wanted him to be at the</v>

1980
01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:51.561
<v Speaker 1>movie and I called him and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you be willing to come over to my </v>

1981
01:22:51.561 --> 01:22:51.561
<v Speaker 1>house and we can just talk through it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and work through it.</v>

1982
01:22:51.561 --> 01:22:53.470
<v Speaker 1>A little desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what harvey weinsteIn shit.</v>

1983
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I made jokes about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made jokes about that immediately to </v>

1984
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.030
<v Speaker 1>him on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1985
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.970
<v Speaker 1>am I going to give you a bath?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1986
01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:05.120
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I tell you I got to go back.</v>

1987
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:11.370
<v Speaker 1>This is more embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember leaving that audition that </v>

1988
01:23:11.370 --> 01:23:15.301
<v Speaker 1>now you're telling me this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first one and tell my agent like </v>

1989
01:23:15.301 --> 01:23:17.350
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I could've done better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did tell him that.</v>

1990
01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:19.000
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no.</v>

1991
01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.120
<v Speaker 1>I could not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1992
01:23:20.121 --> 01:23:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1993
01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

1994
01:23:23.981 --> 01:23:28.981
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that because you have </v>

1995
01:23:28.981 --> 01:23:29.320
<v Speaker 1>energy and you were funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just didn't have that thing that</v>

1996
01:23:29.321 --> 01:23:31.690
<v Speaker 1>I wanted so badly to be a part of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

1997
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:33.670
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it was,</v>

1998
01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:38.700
<v Speaker 1>there was this one thing that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing and then you came over and we </v>

1999
01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:39.940
<v Speaker 1>talked about it and then you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also we got the chance to.</v>

2000
01:23:39.970 --> 01:23:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Because we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he read it,</v>

2001
01:23:41.381 --> 01:23:44.590
<v Speaker 1>he's just reading dialogue that we wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>for anybody.</v>

2002
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:49.830
<v Speaker 1>But then once you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you have somebody's voice in your </v>

2003
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:51.871
<v Speaker 1>head a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can adjust it and make it a little </v>

2004
01:23:51.871 --> 01:23:51.871
<v Speaker 1>more comfortable.</v>

2005
01:23:51.871 --> 01:23:51.871
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2006
01:23:51.871 --> 01:23:55.650
<v Speaker 1>we made some adjustments to the dialogue</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything which made it more </v>

2007
01:23:55.650 --> 01:23:57.370
<v Speaker 1>conducive to your style of speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cadence.</v>

2008
01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2009
01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:58.990
<v Speaker 1>That was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2010
01:23:58.991 --> 01:23:59.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

2011
01:23:59.711 --> 01:24:04.711
<v Speaker 1>And so then he comes back and he does it</v>
<v Speaker 1>again and he crushed it and he was </v>

2012
01:24:04.711 --> 01:24:06.160
<v Speaker 1>really funny and we sent that to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>studio and they were like,</v>

2013
01:24:06.161 --> 01:24:07.570
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's great.</v>

2014
01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:10.660
<v Speaker 1>And it was like such a no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

2015
01:24:10.661 --> 01:24:13.840
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of what I wanted to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this on the podcast because I knew</v>

2016
01:24:13.841 --> 01:24:15.640
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely didn't know that.</v>

2017
01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:17.910
<v Speaker 1>I definitely didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually like,</v>

2018
01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:19.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing though,</v>

2019
01:24:19.870 --> 01:24:24.870
<v Speaker 1>like if that's the big bummer about in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general auditioning is you walk out and </v>

2020
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:29.731
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you follow up with your agent </v>

2021
01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:29.731
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2022
01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:29.731
<v Speaker 1>So what's the feedback?</v>

2023
01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:29.731
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2024
01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:30.400
<v Speaker 1>they look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always,</v>

2025
01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:32.320
<v Speaker 1>they always tell you they loved you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2026
01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:35.380
<v Speaker 1>is there anything else you don't know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like was it good,</v>

2027
01:24:35.381 --> 01:24:40.381
<v Speaker 1>was it bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you also don't know what they're </v>

2028
01:24:40.381 --> 01:24:40.381
<v Speaker 1>looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know.</v>

2029
01:24:40.381 --> 01:24:42.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean go into your place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going over like,</v>

2030
01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:44.860

<v Speaker 1>in detail more is also like,</v>

2031

<v Speaker 1>because you audition now I know I </v>

2032
01:24:49.861 --> 01:24:54.751
<v Speaker 1>tanked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the directors like do you want </v>

2033
01:24:54.751 --> 01:24:55.690
<v Speaker 1>to come work on it so that like possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it better?</v>

2034

<v Speaker 1>then when I found out I booked the role,</v>

2037
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:11.070
<v Speaker 1>then I go there and I feel like it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second part of the contest because like </v>

2038
01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:14.170

<v Speaker 1>Every time we're shooting a scene with </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

2051
01:25:47.010 --> 01:25:52.010

<v Speaker 1>in the scene and I'm just like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2055
01:25:56.450 --> 01:26:01.450
<v Speaker 1>totally is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a scene with maura tierney once </v>

2056
01:26:01.450 --> 01:26:04.051
<v Speaker 1>when I was on newsradio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maura tierney is definitely one of the </v>

2057
01:26:04.051 --> 01:26:07.081
<v Speaker 1>best actors I've ever worked with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was so good that she did the </v>

2058
01:26:07.081 --> 01:26:08.360
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're were rehearsing,</v>

2059
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:13.390
<v Speaker 1>doing all this things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She did the lion in the scene and I </v>

2060
01:26:13.390 --> 01:26:13.390
<v Speaker 1>didn't realize that it was the lion from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scene.</v>

2061
01:26:13.390 --> 01:26:18.371
<v Speaker 1>I realized she was just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought she was just talking because </v>

2062
01:26:18.371 --> 01:26:18.830
<v Speaker 1>of how like she's so natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2063
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:20.840
<v Speaker 1>that kind of creeped me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2064
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:21.740
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2065
01:26:21.741 --> 01:26:22.340
<v Speaker 1>that's the line.</v>

2066
01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.050
<v Speaker 1>That was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2067
01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:28.750
<v Speaker 1>totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2068
01:26:28.890 --> 01:26:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise people like tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are we going to find a guy that's </v>

2069
01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:35.290
<v Speaker 1>going to fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So forth.</v>

2070
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:40.010
<v Speaker 1>She had none of that because she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really an actor before she was.</v>

2071
01:26:40.011 --> 01:26:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I would just say some of them don't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be called actresses.</v>

2072
01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2073
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:48.970
<v Speaker 1>So it's safer to say actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it comics could see who the fuck </v>

2074
01:26:48.970 --> 01:26:51.620
<v Speaker 1>uses comedian remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That went away.</v>

2075
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:53.330
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that doesn't exist </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2076
01:26:53.331 --> 01:26:57.040
<v Speaker 1>You know about the latin x thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that was the thing.</v>

2077
01:26:57.210 --> 01:26:58.460
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

2078
01:26:58.830 --> 01:27:03.830
<v Speaker 1>I was reading this article and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's and latina are male and female.</v>

2079
01:27:05.511 --> 01:27:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Gender specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

2080
01:27:08.530 --> 01:27:13.530
<v Speaker 1>And the word latin also get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets it done as far as.</v>

2081
01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

2082
01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's supposed to be like that's how </v>

2083
01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:22.481
<v Speaker 1>you latin x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should say that you're supposed to </v>

2084
01:27:22.481 --> 01:27:23.930
<v Speaker 1>say latinex because it's just new.</v>

2085
01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:29.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a couple years in the making and </v>

2086
01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:29.540
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see in spanish.</v>

2087
01:27:29.541 --> 01:27:32.360
<v Speaker 1>the masculinized version of these words </v>
<v Speaker 1>just considered gender neutral,</v>

2088
01:27:32.361 --> 01:27:34.700
<v Speaker 1>but that obviously doesn't work for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us like myself.</v>

2089
01:27:34.970 --> 01:27:39.970
<v Speaker 1>And so I think it's appropriate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assign a masculinity as gender neutral </v>

2090
01:27:39.970 --> 01:27:44.771
<v Speaker 1>when it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm latinex well it's interesting </v>

2091
01:27:44.771 --> 01:27:47.561
<v Speaker 1>because my kids are latin and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>another one of the things that we touch </v>

2092
01:27:47.561 --> 01:27:47.980
<v Speaker 1>on to next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2093
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:50.150
<v Speaker 1>there it is and we touch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2094
01:27:50.151 --> 01:27:50.570
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

2095
01:27:50.571 --> 01:27:50.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead,</v>

2096
01:27:50.961 --> 01:27:51.350
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2097
01:27:51.351 --> 01:27:55.280
<v Speaker 1>we touch on this a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not this pronunciation or you know,</v>

2098
01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:59.690
<v Speaker 1>but we touch on that a little bit in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie of there is that feeling,</v>

2099
01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:00.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2100
01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:03.200
<v Speaker 1>when we went in to adopt our kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just open.</v>

2101
01:28:03.201 --> 01:28:04.070
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2102
01:28:04.071 --> 01:28:05.030
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2103
01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:10.100
<v Speaker 1>we're pretty general age wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't go in expecting three kids.</v>

2104
01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2105
01:28:11.091 --> 01:28:13.220
<v Speaker 1>we thought one and it sort of turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>into that.</v>

2106
01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.900
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2107
01:28:14.901 --> 01:28:17.450
<v Speaker 1>you're open to it and you're just there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they ask you,</v>

2108
01:28:17.451 --> 01:28:18.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about ethnIcity?</v>

2109
01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:20.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just go,</v>

2110
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:21.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2111
01:28:21.730 --> 01:28:23.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever the need is,</v>

2112
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:27.380
<v Speaker 1>whoever needs parents let us know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2113
01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:30.600
<v Speaker 1>but then when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it happens and your kids in my,</v>

2114
01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:32.660
<v Speaker 1>in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kids turned out to be latin,</v>

2115
01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:35.260
<v Speaker 1>then you have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2116
01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.250
<v Speaker 1>you start to kind of think about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2117
01:28:37.251 --> 01:28:38.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2118
01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:39.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

2119
01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:40.670
<v Speaker 1>is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that gonna?</v>

2120
01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Is that gonna look like the white savior</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

2121
01:28:42.621 --> 01:28:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Is that going to look weird?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that am I,</v>

2122
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:46.430
<v Speaker 1>am I saying things right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And whatever.</v>

2123
01:28:46.431 --> 01:28:50.000
<v Speaker 1>And what ends up happening is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>really wonderful thing where your family</v>

2124
01:28:50.001 --> 01:28:52.490
<v Speaker 1>becomes this melting pot where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2125
01:28:52.491 --> 01:28:54.040
<v Speaker 1>at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the,</v>

2126
01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:56.630
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the times that we live in right now,</v>

2127
01:28:56.750 --> 01:29:01.750
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little scary jumping into that </v>

2128
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 1>because thinking about what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>

2129
01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:07.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you ultimately are just going to </v>

2130
01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:08.841
<v Speaker 1>think about who the kids are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what their need is and how wonderful </v>

2131
01:29:09.031 --> 01:29:11.670
<v Speaker 1>they are and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you.</v>

2132
01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:16.700
<v Speaker 1>But all of those things come up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the kind of thing that wouldn't </v>

2133
01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:16.700
<v Speaker 1>even be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2134
01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:20.900
<v Speaker 1>why would that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the latinex thing have anything to do </v>

2135
01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:21.480
<v Speaker 1>with my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now it does.</v>

2136
01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've got,</v>

2137
01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:24.300
<v Speaker 1>I've got all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2138
01:29:24.301 --> 01:29:25.260
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2139
01:29:25.290 --> 01:29:30.290
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually find it really interesting </v>

2140
01:29:30.290 --> 01:29:30.290
<v Speaker 1>latinex thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2141
01:29:30.290 --> 01:29:30.570
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that specifically,</v>

2142
01:29:30.571 --> 01:29:35.571
<v Speaker 1>but just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that my family is now this little </v>

2143
01:29:35.571 --> 01:29:35.571
<v Speaker 1>melting pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2144
01:29:35.571 --> 01:29:35.571
<v Speaker 1>that part's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's cool.</v>

2145
01:29:35.571 --> 01:29:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I reject latinex completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2146
01:29:37.591 --> 01:29:38.490
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is cool.</v>

2147
01:29:38.491 --> 01:29:40.800
<v Speaker 1>But it's also very strange that that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

2148
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:45.850
<v Speaker 1>And it would be a real point of concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you would worry about how do I </v>

2149
01:29:45.850 --> 01:29:50.070
<v Speaker 1>handle this new culture without cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriation,</v>

2150
01:29:50.071 --> 01:29:55.071
<v Speaker 1>how do I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I bring my kid and embrace the </v>

2151
01:29:55.071 --> 01:29:56.910
<v Speaker 1>latino or latina culture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do I,</v>

2152
01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:57.960
<v Speaker 1>how do I handle that?</v>

2153
01:29:58.020 --> 01:29:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2154
01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:01.160
<v Speaker 1>And how do we do it without getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>called a racist?</v>

2155
01:30:01.161 --> 01:30:06.161
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it gets back to what I was talking </v>

2156
01:30:06.161 --> 01:30:07.890
<v Speaker 1>about before where you're trying to just</v>
<v Speaker 1>put your kids' needs first and just deal</v>

2157
01:30:07.891 --> 01:30:10.260
<v Speaker 1>with them as children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as individuals,</v>

2158
01:30:10.261 --> 01:30:11.520
<v Speaker 1>as human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2159
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.160
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time you're also,</v>

2160
01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:19.280
<v Speaker 1>you're with other parents and there's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adoption community and really in </v>

2161
01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:23.721
<v Speaker 1>every direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's mixed race families and the </v>

2162
01:30:23.721 --> 01:30:25.530
<v Speaker 1>adoption community and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're kind of learning from them.</v>

2163
01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.150
<v Speaker 1>And it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2164
01:30:27.151 --> 01:30:32.151
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it opens up a lot of conversations with </v>

2165
01:30:32.151 --> 01:30:32.151
<v Speaker 1>your own kids and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just the movies.</v>

2166
01:30:32.151 --> 01:30:34.610
<v Speaker 1>You watch the foods you eat sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2167
01:30:34.630 --> 01:30:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's great.</v>

2168
01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:36.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

2169
01:30:36.331 --> 01:30:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2170
01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:37.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2171
01:30:37.771 --> 01:30:39.060
<v Speaker 1>the language thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

2172
01:30:39.061 --> 01:30:41.890
<v Speaker 1>it stands out more because my whole life</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said latIno,</v>

2173
01:30:41.891 --> 01:30:46.200
<v Speaker 1>like my mother's latina and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny to me to speak spanish.</v>

2174
01:30:46.230 --> 01:30:51.230
<v Speaker 1>He speaks fluently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious because tom has some </v>

2175
01:30:51.230 --> 01:30:54.441
<v Speaker 1>great stories about people not thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>he speaks spanish because when you look </v>

2176
01:30:54.441 --> 01:30:54.441
<v Speaker 1>at them you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2177
01:30:54.441 --> 01:30:57.630
<v Speaker 1>this fucking american guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a regular american guy.</v>

2178

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2200
01:31:49.451 --> 01:31:51.750
<v Speaker 1>went to the naval academy's linguistics </v>
<v Speaker 1>center,</v>

2201
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:56.830
<v Speaker 1>so in the navy and she was in the navy </v>
<v Speaker 1>for awhile and she learned mandarin and </v>

2202
01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 1>it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really</v>

2203
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:03.730
<v Speaker 3>intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we went to a restaurant together and</v>

2204
01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:08.880
<v Speaker 3>the guy who was one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a benihana tight where they chop </v>

2205
01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:12.691
<v Speaker 3>stuff up and the guy was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone asked like where he's from and </v>

2206
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:17.230
<v Speaker 3>he said somewhere in China and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>started speaking mandarin and he dropped</v>

2207
01:32:17.231 --> 01:32:22.231
<v Speaker 3>the thing and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he saw a ghost and she's spitting back </v>

2208
01:32:22.961 --> 01:32:26.920
<v Speaker 3>to them and pretty fluent mandarin and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he stops.</v>

2209
01:32:26.921 --> 01:32:29.200
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen this before.</v>

2210
01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:31.600
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a white person do this.</v>

2211
01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:32.980
<v Speaker 3>And we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2212
01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:34.130
<v Speaker 3>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty wild.</v>

2213
01:32:34.330 --> 01:32:35.410
<v Speaker 3>And then he turned us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2214
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:38.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you understand how hard it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to speak this language,</v>

2215
01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.760
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a pretty good idea,</v>

2216
01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:40.480
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it.</v>

2217
01:32:42.930 --> 01:32:45.220
<v Speaker 3>And then just watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just like,</v>

2218
01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:48.820
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't even start cooking except </v>
<v Speaker 3>your sister to learn.</v>

2219
01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well she was in.</v>

2220
01:32:50.951 --> 01:32:55.951
<v Speaker 3>When you sign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get into like that naval </v>

2221
01:32:55.951 --> 01:32:56.560
<v Speaker 3>institute program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have you going,</v>

2222
01:32:57.370 --> 01:33:00.250
<v Speaker 3>I think it was something like eight </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours a day,</v>

2223
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:03.220
<v Speaker 3>five or six days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really,</v>

2224
01:33:03.221 --> 01:33:05.710
<v Speaker 3>it's super into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like learning mandarin.</v>

2225
01:33:05.890 --> 01:33:08.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it overwhelms people.</v>

2226
01:33:08.201 --> 01:33:11.800
<v Speaker 3>People drop out almost like in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical stress way,</v>

2227
01:33:11.801 --> 01:33:16.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people just can't handle the camp </v>

2228
01:33:16.801 --> 01:33:17.180
<v Speaker 3>like bootcamp and I forget how long she </v>
<v Speaker 3>was in and you know,</v>

2229
01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:22.200
<v Speaker 3>she didn't reach the level of I'm super </v>
<v Speaker 3>fluent,</v>

2230
01:33:22.631 --> 01:33:27.631
<v Speaker 3>like we're speaking english,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was able to communicate in </v>

2231
01:33:27.631 --> 01:33:27.670
<v Speaker 3>mandarin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can she read it?</v>

2232
01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:33.540
<v Speaker 3>She was reading and writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing is she was telling me </v>

2233
01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:33.540
<v Speaker 3>one time about how many characters and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2234
01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:38.491
<v Speaker 3>it was just unbelievable and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's sounds for expressions like I'm </v>

2235
01:33:38.491 --> 01:33:39.190
<v Speaker 3>going to screw up [inaudible] I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember it,</v>

2236
01:33:39.191 --> 01:33:41.740
<v Speaker 3>but she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do something like,</v>

2237
01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:46.770
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that means like means an actual </v>

2238
01:33:46.770 --> 01:33:47.640
<v Speaker 3>phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2239
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:50.240
<v Speaker 3>like there's so many and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2240
01:33:50.450 --> 01:33:54.820
<v Speaker 3>that there's characters that mean entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>expressions as well,</v>

2241
01:33:54.821 --> 01:33:55.780
<v Speaker 3>that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just,</v>

2242
01:33:55.930 --> 01:34:00.930
<v Speaker 3>our brains are so married to our </v>
<v Speaker 3>alphabet and way of speaking that it's a</v>

2243
01:34:01.181 --> 01:34:03.850
<v Speaker 3>real jump to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to learn that,</v>

2244
01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:04.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2245
01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:09.960
<v Speaker 3>it really is fascinating when you travel</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you listen to people speaking their </v>

2246
01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:13.590
<v Speaker 3>native tongue and you realize how </v>
<v Speaker 3>strangely different languages are across</v>

2247
01:34:13.841 --> 01:34:14.650
<v Speaker 3>the entire planet.</v>

2248
01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Just unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Thailand thIs summer and you </v>

2249
01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:20.280
<v Speaker 3>listen to people talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tie and everything.</v>

2250
01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:24.100
<v Speaker 3>Everything stretches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got like a stretch to it,</v>

2251
01:34:24.370 --> 01:34:25.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a weird.</v>

2252
01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:28.690
<v Speaker 3>It's very odd language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2253
01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:34.020
<v Speaker 3>compare that to like german or dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the germans got those hard sounding</v>

2254
01:34:35.741 --> 01:34:36.250
<v Speaker 3>really hard.</v>

2255
01:34:38.530 --> 01:34:40.990
<v Speaker 3>it's like this weird difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

01:34:40.991 --> 01:34:43.120
<v Speaker 3>And the latin one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>latin root word,</v>

2257
01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:48.150
<v Speaker 3>like languages all do have a flowy </v>
<v Speaker 3>singing sounds kind of nice to listen to</v>

2258
01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:50.230
<v Speaker 3>the language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really nice.</v>

2266
01:35:02.481 --> 01:35:04.730
<v Speaker 3>What the hell are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it when I write.</v>

2267
01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:09.820
<v Speaker 3>I listen to spanish music when I write </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I have no idea what they're </v>

2268
01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:13.211
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did that to you listen to music in a </v>

2269
01:35:13.211 --> 01:35:13.211
<v Speaker 3>foreign language so that it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>

2270
01:35:13.211 --> 01:35:13.710
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't distract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2271

<v Speaker 3>it sounds good.</v>

2273
01:35:15.831 --> 01:35:17.060
<v Speaker 3>It gives me a little something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2274
01:35:17.061 --> 01:35:19.550
<v Speaker 3>But I can still think about the exact </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that I'm thinking about.</v>

2275
01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I recently had this interesting </v>

2276

<v Speaker 3>between it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's predominantlY what you speak,</v>

01:36:03.341 --> 01:36:04.670
<v Speaker 3>once your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your ears are trained to it,</v>

2294
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.090
<v Speaker 3>you can listen to someone say a sentence</v>
<v Speaker 3>and know that it's,</v>

2295
01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:09.020
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's from Spain.</v>

2296
01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:09.580
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2297
01:36:09.810 --> 01:36:12.200
<v Speaker 3>that's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's the cuban version of it,</v>

2298
01:36:12.201 --> 01:36:13.850
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2299
01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Version of the way they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the island dialects sound </v>

2300
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:20.000
<v Speaker 3>dramatically different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2301
01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:23.270
<v Speaker 3>like if you listen to somebody from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cuba,</v>

2302
01:36:23.630 --> 01:36:27.500
<v Speaker 3>puerto rico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it a comparison like english speakers</v>

2303
01:36:27.530 --> 01:36:29.930
<v Speaker 3>from America versus english speakers </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Ireland?</v>

2304
01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:31.250
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

2305
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:32.270
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2306
01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:33.290

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2307
01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:37.060
<v Speaker 3>I always think of Spain as like our </v>
<v Speaker 3>britain,</v>

2308
01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:42.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way like the language properly </v>

2309
01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:43.010
<v Speaker 3>english is from england.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where the language,</v>

2310
01:36:43.011 --> 01:36:48.011
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you speak it spanish and a guest to </v>

2311
01:36:48.011 --> 01:36:51.590
<v Speaker 3>yet castilian that comes from Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're speaking oji spanish and then it</v>

2312
01:36:52.401 --> 01:36:57.401
<v Speaker 3>all kind of came over here and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>influenced and every country has </v>

2313
01:36:57.401 --> 01:36:58.610
<v Speaker 3>different ways of saying things </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

2314
01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:00.680
<v Speaker 3>Obviously different slAng,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>all different expressions,</v>

2316
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:08.890
<v Speaker 3>completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even words like as simple as like to </v>

2319
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:14.960
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say that in Mexico or Argentina,</v>

2320
01:37:14.961 --> 01:37:17.730
<v Speaker 3>it literally means to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So really?</v>

2321
01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:22.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2323
01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:22.760
<v Speaker 3>you're saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to fuck this water?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to fuck this bottle.</v>

2325
01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:31.970
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mom told me that she was In a,</v>

2326
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:37.510
<v Speaker 3>in Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when her youth and traveled there </v>

2327
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.790
<v Speaker 3>and was with a bell hop and she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2328
01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:38.490
<v Speaker 3>go ahead man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on.</v>

2329
01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pick up that suitcase.</v>

2330
01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:41.810
<v Speaker 3>But he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2331
01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:45.290
<v Speaker 3>because she was basically in slang </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying fuck my suitcase,</v>

2332
01:37:45.291 --> 01:37:47.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's just.</v>

2333
01:37:47.481 --> 01:37:48.830
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like,</v>

2334
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:54.080
<v Speaker 3>there's also like severity of words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like hold aid is the word,</v>

2335
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:55.650
<v Speaker 3>like there's so many ways to say fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2336
01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:56.730
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in every language.</v>

2337
01:37:57.030 --> 01:38:01.350
<v Speaker 3>But khaled in Spain is like saying fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like going like,</v>

2338
01:38:01.351 --> 01:38:01.980
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>

2339
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:05.070
<v Speaker 3>But like when you say it in Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nomi has,</v>

2340
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:06.990
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a softer.</v>

2341
01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:09.480
<v Speaker 3>It's not taken as severely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not,</v>

2342
01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:14.310
<v Speaker 3>it's not read the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not saying you're saying,</v>

2343
01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:15.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2344
01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:17.160
<v Speaker 3>like you're complaining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're like,</v>

2345
01:38:17.161 --> 01:38:17.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2346
01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:18.900
<v Speaker 3>it's taken as like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2347
01:38:18.901 --> 01:38:20.940
<v Speaker 3>don't mess with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2348
01:38:20.970 --> 01:38:22.860
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even when I would say when I would go to</v>

2349
01:38:22.861 --> 01:38:24.240
<v Speaker 3>Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>

2350
01:38:24.241 --> 01:38:25.260
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you curse a lot.</v>

2351
01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:26.370
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

2352
01:38:26.970 --> 01:38:28.510
<v Speaker 3>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2353
01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:32.400
<v Speaker 3>we went over that one and then like six </v>
<v Speaker 3>months later they were like,</v>

2354
01:38:32.401 --> 01:38:33.930
<v Speaker 3>you actually do curse a lot all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2355
01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:34.740
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2356
01:38:34.741 --> 01:38:38.220
<v Speaker 3>that's probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you do stand up in spanish when you.</v>

2357
01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:43.730

<v Speaker 3>I involve both english and spanish,</v>

<v Speaker 3>would do cuban spanish plus english and </v>

2368
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:23.740
<v Speaker 3>it was impossible to follow because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the audiences were,</v>

2369
01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:26.940
<v Speaker 3>there's so many cuban people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience and he would hit punch lines in</v>

2370
01:39:26.941 --> 01:39:31.941
<v Speaker 3>spanish and people would literally just </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw chairs through windows and jumped </v>

2371
01:39:31.941 --> 01:39:34.350
<v Speaker 3>through the cla people where he would </v>

<v Speaker 3>wasn't saying it was totally insane and </v>

2375

<v Speaker 3>probably less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe like 75 or something and it had </v>

01:41:11.101 --> 01:41:11.101
<v Speaker 2>yonder bag so you couldn't use it while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were inside the store,</v>

2408
01:41:11.101 --> 01:41:15.990
<v Speaker 2>so you know what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could leave the room and use the </v>

2409
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:15.990
<v Speaker 2>yonder bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2410
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:18.520
<v Speaker 2>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire set,</v>

2411
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:21.550
<v Speaker 2>it was the only place where the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>set people just kept coming and going.</v>

2412
01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:26.940
<v Speaker 2>They just kept leaving and coming back </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was so many people doing it and it</v>

2413
01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:30.220
<v Speaker 2>might've been like dozens of people at </v>
<v Speaker 2>any point in time walking around,</v>

2414
01:41:30.221 --> 01:41:35.221
<v Speaker 2>coming and going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going outside to get to use their phone </v>

2415
01:41:35.221 --> 01:41:35.980
<v Speaker 2>and then coming back in like it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

2416
01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:41.400
<v Speaker 2>The phone thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that there's a real good </v>

2417
01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:44.790
<v Speaker 2>solution yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did the yonder thing in new </v>

2418
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:46.270
<v Speaker 2>orleans and that place wasn't too big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

2419
01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:47.860
<v Speaker 2>it was still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could tell like,</v>

2420
01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:50.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's inconvenient for them.</v>

2421
01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a long thing to go thRough that,</v>

2422
01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.720
<v Speaker 2>but then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have people coming and going in</v>

2423
01:41:55.721 --> 01:41:58.120
<v Speaker 2>and out of the showroom because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to use their phone.</v>

2424
01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:00.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking nightmare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they don't,</v>

2425
01:42:01.210 --> 01:42:04.180
<v Speaker 2>if they just sit there and just tune </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the show,</v>

2426
01:42:04.210 --> 01:42:05.860
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 10 percent better.</v>

2427
01:42:05.861 --> 01:42:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2428
01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:12.380
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to impose that on people too </v>

2429
01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:12.760
<v Speaker 2>and a surprised when people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2430
01:42:12.761 --> 01:42:15.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing what with my phone man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to put it in a bag.</v>

2431
01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:20.940
<v Speaker 2>It's still going to be on you and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can use it as long as you leave this </v>

2432
01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:20.940
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

2433
01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:20.940
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of,</v>

2434
01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:25.801
<v Speaker 2>no man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to check my phone every 18 </v>

2435
01:42:25.801 --> 01:42:25.801
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2436
01:42:25.801 --> 01:42:28.970
<v Speaker 2>I had to let people know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some people that just want </v>

2437
01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:29.530
<v Speaker 2>to film everything to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when you get on stage,</v>

2438
01:42:29.531 --> 01:42:34.531
<v Speaker 2>you see people just stand there while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing your set and they're </v>

2439
01:42:34.531 --> 01:42:34.740
<v Speaker 2>holding a phone up you and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

2440
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:36.850
<v Speaker 2>You're making this whole thing so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>weirder.</v>

2441
01:42:37.010 --> 01:42:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand what you're doing?</v>

2442
01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.800
<v Speaker 2>You're basically like a tmz guy at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>airport,</v>

2443
01:42:42.130 --> 01:42:46.200
<v Speaker 2>like they're watching a show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like holding it up in front of them like</v>

2444
01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:48.870
<v Speaker 2>they're not even looking at for comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

2445
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:54.350
<v Speaker 2>I went to of all things a daddy daughter</v>
<v Speaker 2>dance with my daughter and it was the </v>

2446
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:58.861
<v Speaker 2>weirdest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every guy was dancing with their little </v>

2447
01:42:58.861 --> 01:43:02.641
<v Speaker 2>kids like this and I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized that why they were doing it.</v>

2448
01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:06.340
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't about the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a little bit,</v>

2449
01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:11.610
<v Speaker 2>but it was more about that that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have that phone out and you're looking </v>

2450
01:43:11.610 --> 01:43:13.390
<v Speaker 2>at that screen and you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of keeps everything else out.</v>

2451
01:43:13.390 --> 01:43:18.390
<v Speaker 2>It makes you feel like you're having </v>
<v Speaker 2>this little moment instead of having to </v>

2452
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:21.571
<v Speaker 2>be this awkward thing of like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>dancing in front of these other grown </v>

2453
01:43:21.571 --> 01:43:21.900
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's done.</v>

2454
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:26.910
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're just trying to capture </v>

2455
01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:26.910
<v Speaker 2>these moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2456
01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:27.820
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're painfully aware that they're only</v>

2457
01:43:27.821 --> 01:43:29.570
<v Speaker 2>going to be six for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2458
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:31.330
<v Speaker 2>but not all night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2459
01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Because that's the problem is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wind up as a parent,</v>

2460
01:43:34.391 --> 01:43:36.220
<v Speaker 2>you wind up with all this video that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2461
01:43:36.250 --> 01:43:37.870
<v Speaker 2>that you're never going to watch because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

2462
01:43:37.871 --> 01:43:39.400
<v Speaker 2>But you're thinking logicAlly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2463
01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe people aren't.</v>

2464
01:43:40.830 --> 01:43:42.680
<v Speaker 2>They're just collecting video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2465
01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:44.440
<v Speaker 2>they're just collecting their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hoarders.</v>

2466
01:43:44.650 --> 01:43:49.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that made me think of it </v>

2467
01:43:49.650 --> 01:43:49.650
<v Speaker 2>though is that I was more comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I had the phone on.</v>

2468
01:43:49.650 --> 01:43:50.620
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

2469
01:43:50.621 --> 01:43:52.340
<v Speaker 2>because I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing something,</v>

2470
01:43:52.341 --> 01:43:57.341
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not just dancing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I'm just doing this thing I'm </v>

2471
01:43:57.341 --> 01:43:58.310
<v Speaker 2>doing like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a parental kind of thing.</v>

2472
01:43:58.310 --> 01:44:03.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm just documenting my cute kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when I put the phone away I </v>

2473
01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:03.380
<v Speaker 2>felt a lot more exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

2474
01:44:03.381 --> 01:44:04.800
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

2475
01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:09.980
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was painful for everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>that dance doing my ah,</v>

2476
01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:11.040
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2477
01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:13.130
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and every guy there had the same,</v>

2478
01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:14.450
<v Speaker 2>had the same feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

2479
01:44:14.451 --> 01:44:15.590
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was just like,</v>

2480
01:44:15.591 --> 01:44:16.580
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do it.</v>

2481
01:44:16.581 --> 01:44:18.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm putting my phone away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is stupid.</v>

2482
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:20.300
<v Speaker 2>And tell you what though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2483
01:44:20.301 --> 01:44:24.470
<v Speaker 2>you go back and look at those videos </v>
<v Speaker 2>from when your kid was really little and</v>

2484
01:44:24.471 --> 01:44:25.940
<v Speaker 2>it does freak you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're,</v>

2485
01:44:25.950 --> 01:44:28.250
<v Speaker 2>they're really valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Powerful videos.</v>

2486
01:44:28.410 --> 01:44:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Videos of your kids when they're really </v>

2487
01:44:33.410 --> 01:44:33.410
<v Speaker 2>young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so,</v>

2488
01:44:33.410 --> 01:44:33.410
<v Speaker 2>there's a video of my daughter when she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

2489
01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:39.010
<v Speaker 2>she was wearing a diaper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she was probably just a little </v>

2490
01:44:39.010 --> 01:44:41.891
<v Speaker 2>over one and we're walking through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>airport and I'm pulling a,</v>

2491
01:44:41.951 --> 01:44:46.951
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those little roller bags and </v>

2492
01:44:46.951 --> 01:44:46.951
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's behind it,</v>

2493
01:44:46.951 --> 01:44:46.951
<v Speaker 2>pushing it.</v>

2494
01:44:46.951 --> 01:44:51.040
<v Speaker 2>She liked to push it on her legs like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that tall and a little diaper butt and </v>

2495
01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:52.910
<v Speaker 2>me pushing this thing and we tell her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2496
01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.250
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go to a toy store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

2497
01:44:55.280 --> 01:45:00.280
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she puts her hands together and she </v>

2498
01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:00.600
<v Speaker 2>pushes the bag in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like the most adorable.</v>

2499
01:45:00.601 --> 01:45:02.940
<v Speaker 2>My watched that video hundred times </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier.</v>

2500
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that video will forever be </v>

2501
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.360
<v Speaker 2>stained in my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy mode.</v>

2502
01:45:08.410 --> 01:45:10.220
<v Speaker 2>We've got these videos too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an inch.</v>

2503
01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:12.740
<v Speaker 2>There's a really interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were starting to get there earlier in</v>

2504
01:45:12.741 --> 01:45:17.741
<v Speaker 2>our conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's an interesting thing that </v>

2505
01:45:17.741 --> 01:45:19.751
<v Speaker 2>happens when you adopt kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly kids that are already </v>

2506
01:45:19.751 --> 01:45:20.120
<v Speaker 2>walking and talking when they come into </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

2507
01:45:20.630 --> 01:45:25.630
<v Speaker 2>You go through this really chaotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>adjustment period because nobody knows </v>

2508
01:45:25.630 --> 01:45:27.170
<v Speaker 2>each other and it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>

2509
01:45:27.230 --> 01:45:30.560
<v Speaker 2>it's just so awkward for everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved and and there's.</v>

2510
01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:32.570
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much to it,</v>

2511
01:45:32.571 --> 01:45:34.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's a reallY difficult time for </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>

2512
01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:37.880
<v Speaker 2>but then when you have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get on the other side of it and</v>

2513
01:45:37.881 --> 01:45:42.881
<v Speaker 2>he really falling in love with your kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could feel that they're falling </v>

2514
01:45:42.881 --> 01:45:42.881
<v Speaker 2>in love with you and you're becoming </v>
<v Speaker 2>this family.</v>

2515
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:48.430
<v Speaker 2>We have these videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went on this trip back to Wisconsin </v>

2516
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:51.041
<v Speaker 2>where I'm from and when we were just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things were really starting to come </v>

2517
01:45:51.041 --> 01:45:52.340
<v Speaker 2>together before this trip and then when </v>
<v Speaker 2>we went on the trip,</v>

2518
01:45:52.341 --> 01:45:54.620
<v Speaker 2>the kids like you're describing the kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing the suitcase,</v>

2519
01:45:54.621 --> 01:45:59.621
<v Speaker 2>like they have to stay a little tighter </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you because you're in airports and </v>

2520
01:45:59.621 --> 01:46:03.071
<v Speaker 2>you're and you're driving and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to like a cabin and doing these </v>

2521
01:46:03.071 --> 01:46:03.860
<v Speaker 2>things and by the time we got back we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were a family.</v>

2522
01:46:03.861 --> 01:46:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Like we knew my wife and I were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2523
01:46:05.841 --> 01:46:06.510
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2524
01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:08.320
<v Speaker 2>we're like a real family now.</v>

2525
01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:13.320
<v Speaker 2>Like we love these kids so much and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can tell they love us and it's an </v>

2526
01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:16.301
<v Speaker 2>amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have videos from that trip and </v>

2527
01:46:16.301 --> 01:46:16.400
<v Speaker 2>those videos like you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or just like gold,</v>

2528
01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:21.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so amazing to see this phone </v>

2529
01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:21.740
<v Speaker 2>number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bonding.</v>

2530
01:46:21.930 --> 01:46:25.070
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be such an intense feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2531
01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:30.360
<v Speaker 2>to realize that these kids could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone in some terrible direction.</v>

2532
01:46:31.071 --> 01:46:33.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean they could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're six years old,</v>

2533
01:46:33.201 --> 01:46:33.730
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2534
01:46:33.731 --> 01:46:34.490
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2535
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:37.820
<v Speaker 2>anything can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything can go wrong.</v>

2536
01:46:37.821 --> 01:46:40.940
<v Speaker 2>And instead they got so lucky and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>found you.</v>

2537
01:46:41.090 --> 01:46:46.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like what an incredibly positive </v>

2538
01:46:46.551 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 2>thing that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've done an incredibly</v>

2539
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:53.400
<v Speaker 1>positive thing for their lives that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>came in contact with you.</v>

2540
01:46:53.401 --> 01:46:55.440
<v Speaker 1>And so fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2541
01:46:55.470 --> 01:46:57.750
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for our lives too,</v>

2542
01:46:57.751 --> 01:46:59.700
<v Speaker 1>and we didn't know it for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2543
01:46:59.730 --> 01:47:04.730
<v Speaker 1>we had that period where we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really feel like for awhile they're </v>

2544
01:47:04.730 --> 01:47:04.730
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2545
01:47:04.730 --> 01:47:09.201
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done a good thing here and we're </v>

2546
01:47:09.201 --> 01:47:09.201
<v Speaker 1>going to suffer for it for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our lives.</v>

2547
01:47:09.201 --> 01:47:10.650
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then as it comes online,</v>

2548
01:47:10.651 --> 01:47:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I had this one more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you this,</v>

2549
01:47:12.391 --> 01:47:15.660
<v Speaker 1>but I had this one moment that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not this kind of guy,</v>

2550
01:47:15.661 --> 01:47:17.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think of myself as this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

2551
01:47:17.281 --> 01:47:21.720
<v Speaker 1>but after all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just frustration and craziness and,</v>

2552
01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:26.780
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids would wake up really early </v>

2553
01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:30.680
<v Speaker 1>every morning and they would be out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hallway throwing things at each </v>

2554
01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:30.680
<v Speaker 1>other and arguing and whatever.</v>

2555
01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:33.980
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so sleep deprived and you're </v>

2556
01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:33.980
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like the overheads.</v>

2557
01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:36.930
<v Speaker 1>And one morning I woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a sunday and it was quiet</v>

2558
01:47:36.931 --> 01:47:39.050
<v Speaker 1>in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife was still asleep and it was like</v>

2559
01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:43.080
<v Speaker 1>around the time where the kids are </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally up and I woke up and I thought,</v>

2560
01:47:43.110 --> 01:47:44.310
<v Speaker 1>oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quiet in here.</v>

2561
01:47:44.311 --> 01:47:48.280
<v Speaker 1>And then I had this just overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling that I couldn't even identify it</v>

2562
01:47:48.281 --> 01:47:49.200
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I thought,</v>

2563
01:47:49.650 --> 01:47:52.140
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I missed them right now.</v>

2564
01:47:52.141 --> 01:47:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm actually waiting for them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come in the room and wake us up.</v>

2565
01:47:55.141 --> 01:48:00.141
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was really a big moment for me </v>

2566
01:48:00.141 --> 01:48:00.141
<v Speaker 1>where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2567
01:48:00.141 --> 01:48:02.430
<v Speaker 1>I've turned a big corner here and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you get from them and that,</v>

2568
01:48:02.431 --> 01:48:04.380
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of feelings is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>

2569
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Is this strange scene in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like thinking that this is based on not </v>

2570
01:48:09.751 --> 01:48:14.751
<v Speaker 1>just your life experience but also based</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your interaction with some kids that </v>

2571
01:48:14.751 --> 01:48:14.751
<v Speaker 1>you never wanted up adopting?</v>

2572
01:48:14.751 --> 01:48:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

2573
01:48:15.361 --> 01:48:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Well and also I met a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I said,</v>

2574
01:48:17.461 --> 01:48:20.040
<v Speaker 1>I've met a bunch of families along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>waY and some of the.</v>

2575
01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:25.080
<v Speaker 1>There's this young girl named Maria </v>
<v Speaker 1>Green who became a consultant on the </v>

2576
01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:25.080
<v Speaker 1>movie because she grew up in foster </v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

2577
01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:27.210
<v Speaker 1>She was adopted as a teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's amazIng kid.</v>

2578
01:48:27.211 --> 01:48:32.211
<v Speaker 1>She goes to ucla right now and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I know either my own stories or </v>

2579
01:48:34.141 --> 01:48:39.141
<v Speaker 1>other people's stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can associate them with really </v>

2580
01:48:39.141 --> 01:48:39.141
<v Speaker 1>specific kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing that's embarrassing is that</v>

2581
01:48:39.141 --> 01:48:44.091
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking the movie all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and I've seen the movie like a </v>

2582
01:48:44.091 --> 01:48:44.130
<v Speaker 1>thousand times now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And anytime I watch it with an audience,</v>

2583
01:48:44.131 --> 01:48:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I get emotional watching the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the movie is really funny,</v>

2584
01:48:47.671 --> 01:48:51.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's got some really emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments and it's embarrassing because it</v>

2585
01:48:51.421 --> 01:48:52.790
<v Speaker 1>looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh good.</v>

2586
01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:54.690
<v Speaker 1>So broken up by my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my own movie,</v>

2587
01:48:56.670 --> 01:49:01.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's really because I'm thinking </v>

2588
01:49:01.670 --> 01:49:01.670
<v Speaker 1>about my own kids or I'm thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2589
01:49:01.670 --> 01:49:02.850
<v Speaker 1>these real kids that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2590
01:49:02.851 --> 01:49:03.960
<v Speaker 1>that I've met along the way.</v>

2591
01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:05.420
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty good.</v>

2592
01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:08.460
<v Speaker 3>I got to tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I know I'm in it and I'm amazing in</v>

2593
01:49:08.461 --> 01:49:09.720
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying I'm saying,</v>

2594
01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:11.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the.</v>

2595
01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:16.220
<v Speaker 3>We went to the screening like a month or</v>
<v Speaker 3>two ago and christina and I,</v>

2596
01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:21.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get there and we run into mark right </v>

2597
01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:21.440
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's like,</v>

2598
01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:22.380
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you haven't seen this?</v>

2599
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:23.490
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2600
01:49:23.491 --> 01:49:26.310
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really men.</v>

2601
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:27.840
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2602
01:49:27.841 --> 01:49:29.070
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep hearing it's good.</v>

2603
01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:30.270
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2604
01:49:30.271 --> 01:49:35.271
<v Speaker 3>Like he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was prepping me for how emotional he </v>

2605
01:49:35.271 --> 01:49:35.850
<v Speaker 3>gets in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2606
01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:36.540
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2607
01:49:36.541 --> 01:49:36.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2608
01:49:36.881 --> 01:49:41.881
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been some violent stuff that's </v>

2609
01:49:41.881 --> 01:49:41.881
<v Speaker 3>awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this,</v>

2610
01:49:41.881 --> 01:49:46.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm in and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't help but like get emotional </v>

2611
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.650
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2612
01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:47.800
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2613
01:49:47.801 --> 01:49:52.801
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I sit there and watch and then </v>

2614
01:49:52.801 --> 01:49:52.990
<v Speaker 3>I look over seeing this crying and parts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the movie.</v>

2615
01:49:52.991 --> 01:49:57.991
<v Speaker 3>I start getting emotional person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean it's like he actually says </v>

2616
01:49:57.991 --> 01:50:02.390
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did a really good job of balancing </v>

2617
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.770
<v Speaker 3>those emotional moments with the comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2618
01:50:02.771 --> 01:50:04.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you do it,</v>

2619
01:50:04.121 --> 01:50:09.121
<v Speaker 3>but like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the back and forth of it was like a </v>

2620
01:50:09.121 --> 01:50:09.121
<v Speaker 3>perfect balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's,</v>

2621
01:50:09.121 --> 01:50:09.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a great movie.</v>

2622
01:50:09.701 --> 01:50:12.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody who's seen it has,</v>

2623
01:50:12.730 --> 01:50:16.540
<v Speaker 3>you know that has said anything to me is</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like blown away by the movie.</v>

2624
01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2625
01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that balance of comedy and drama was</v>

2626
01:50:19.731 --> 01:50:24.731
<v Speaker 1>what we worked on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the number one thing we worked </v>

2627
01:50:24.731 --> 01:50:26.030
<v Speaker 1>on through every draft of everything and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great and it is really fun to watch</v>

2628
01:50:26.031 --> 01:50:28.430
<v Speaker 1>with an audience because they do get </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally caught up in it,</v>

2629
01:50:28.431 --> 01:50:31.130
<v Speaker 1>but we're always coming back and giving </v>
<v Speaker 1>them a laugh where they need it.</v>

2630
01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:32.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a hit.</v>

2631
01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they're going to want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dig down to other aspects of your </v>

2632
01:50:37.930 --> 01:50:38.180
<v Speaker 1>personal life to pull out this is all I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>

2633
01:50:38.210 --> 01:50:43.210
<v Speaker 1>This is bluestar airlines for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what does bluestar airlines in </v>

2634
01:50:43.210 --> 01:50:47.561
<v Speaker 1>wall street when charlie sheen couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell anything to gordon gekko and then </v>

2635
01:50:47.561 --> 01:50:47.600
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what about bluestar lines?</v>

2636
01:50:47.601 --> 01:50:52.601
<v Speaker 1>Because he had the tip from his dad </v>
<v Speaker 1>because his dad was a mechanic at blue </v>

2637
01:50:52.601 --> 01:50:55.611
<v Speaker 1>star alliance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been kind of the running joke </v>

2638
01:50:55.611 --> 01:50:55.611
<v Speaker 1>that this is the only interesting thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my life.</v>

2639
01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I've Already gone there and It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2640
01:50:59.121 --> 01:51:00.560
<v Speaker 1>when this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When this happens,</v>

2641
01:51:00.561 --> 01:51:01.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

2642
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:04.520
<v Speaker 1>you become part of that adoption </v>
<v Speaker 1>community as well,</v>

2643
01:51:04.521 --> 01:51:09.521
<v Speaker 1>so it really becomes a big part of who </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are and who your family is and that </v>

2644
01:51:09.521 --> 01:51:09.700
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

2645
01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:12.020
<v Speaker 1>this is all I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this.</v>

2646
01:51:12.021 --> 01:51:17.021
<v Speaker 1>And then making movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This must be a different movie for you </v>

2647
01:51:17.021 --> 01:51:17.021
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

2648
01:51:17.021 --> 01:51:21.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you love your other movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this one's going to be a really </v>

2649
01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:21.560
<v Speaker 1>different fits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really different because I,</v>

2650
01:51:21.561 --> 01:51:23.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about sex drive before and</v>

2651
01:51:23.511 --> 01:51:28.511
<v Speaker 1>the reason why that one was a special </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in my heart is because it was my </v>

2652
01:51:28.511 --> 01:51:28.511
<v Speaker 1>first real hollywood movie and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2653
01:51:28.710 --> 01:51:29.430
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2654
01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:34.460
<v Speaker 1>it was just such an amazing experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>to just be this bumpkin from out of </v>

2655
01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:35.930
<v Speaker 1>nowhere making this movie with all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>budget and it was great.</v>

2656
01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:39.470
<v Speaker 1>But I've had great experiences on all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the movies that I've made,</v>

2657
01:51:39.471 --> 01:51:41.690
<v Speaker 1>but this one is totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different tone.</v>

2658
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:44.300
<v Speaker 1>It has more drama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has more gravity to it.</v>

2659
01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:48.180
<v Speaker 1>It's about something that is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really important to me and it.</v>

2660
01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:51.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's really funny and we have people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like tom and the movIe and tom is,</v>

2661
01:51:51.771 --> 01:51:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2662
01:51:52.161 --> 01:51:54.500
<v Speaker 1>we're joking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he is really funny in the movie.</v>

2663
01:51:54.770 --> 01:51:56.980
<v Speaker 1>I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was funny.</v>

2664
01:51:56.981 --> 01:51:58.160
<v Speaker 1>He's a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2667
