Hello freaks.
The fuck is going on out there on freak world and you're like,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.620
Everybody is.
It's impossible to avoid.
If you think you're not a freak,

4
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:20.220
you're more likely a freak.
If you think you're a freak,
you're probably normal.

5
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.250
That's probably the truth.
If you like,
I don't fucking fit in,
man.

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.690
You're probably normal,

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.530
but all you Weirdos who thinks this makes sense.

8
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.060

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.250
Everybody does.
I've been telling my fucking trainer about this shit for weeks.

13
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:49.230

18
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.180
It's a beautiful situation.
What you do is you try to sign up,

19
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.040
you test it,
you enter in your information.

20
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.020
As far as like your name and all that jazz,

21
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.370
but you don't have to enter in your credit card information at all until you

22
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:27.210
decide that you want to use it.
So try it out.
Create a website and then go.

23
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:31.020
You know what?
This is fucking easy.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.470
You can create an online store in minutes.

30
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.520
You could easily sell music,
digital downloads.

31
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.700
Say if you're a band and you decide,
you know what man,

32
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.520
our band needs a fucking a way to sell our music online.

33
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.780
Do you could do that on Squarespace.

34
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.550
Why are you fucking around while you glued to your couch?

35
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:13.230
You fucking Lazy Bitch today.
Just for once in your goddamn life.

36
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.490
Do it.
Just get up and be the person that you could be.

37
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.260
Live to your fucking potential.
Go make a fucking website.

38
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.340
You can put together an events calendar,
social media integrations.
You can,

39
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.110
you know,
connect it to Twitter or Facebook,
Tumblr.
It also works on everything.

40
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:33.480
It works on android phones,
works on Windows,
works on a Mac,

41
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.010
works on different browsers,

42
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:37.830
which was always the big thing when you had a fucking website,

43
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.740
like some asshole to try to break out like Netscape.

44
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.890
Use Your Shit on Netscape and it comes out.

45
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.200
Boxes is little fucking stacked on top of each other.
By the way,

46
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:49.680
none of the websites created during the making of this podcast reflect reality.

47
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.920
Tom does not like cock.
He's a happily married man to a woman.

48
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.580
These are just jokes.
His wife is here.
Okay?

49
00:02:56.581 --> 00:03:00.940
We have actual solid that he likes women.
His beard is here.

50
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.040
Don Tom has bud sex in this house.
Um,
and that is online right now.

51
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.090
That's how easy it is to make a website with squares.
This is it.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.400
making someone way your packages and shit.

64

74
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.840

Super Illegal.

Mail on stamps.com because you know the,

the postman actually comes to your house,

92
00:05:36.951 --> 00:05:39.130
so you give him the packages and your dignity.
Dignity done.

93

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.420
you guys like are the only couple that I know that where it actually works.

146
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.260
It's why I hate generalizations.
I hate generalizations.

147
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:03.720
They drive me nuts because you know when someone says,

148
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:05.580
well you know all these men are angry.

149
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:09.690
This are all these women are angry that or you know,
this is that and that.
Yeah,

150
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.480
well Comedians,
they can never get along together.

151
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.900
It just doesn't work to creative people to people that think they're funny

152
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:18.120
together.
It's not going to work and it never does.

153
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.870
It's always like either the girls funnier than the guy or the guy's funny than

154
00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:24.840
the girl and there's always this weird fucking resentment thing.

155
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.520
You guys are the only ones that I know that actually pull it off where you're

156
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:34.521
both funny and you actually are like you're really best friends on top of being

157
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:37.350
married.
Like you have this air of,

158
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.610
it's very different than the air of most couples.
You know much different.

159
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:42.430
Much of that.

160
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:47.310
I think we enjoy each other like we enjoy each millions of humor.
Legit.

161
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.490
Yeah and I think he's super talented and amazing.

162
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.640
That's the weird thing about it.
You guys see both actually like each other.

163
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.910
It doesn't make any sense.
We support each other trying to figure it out.

164
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.070
I've been trying,
I'm studying guys for years.

165
00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:00.900
I'm like there's something wrong here.
It is fun.

166
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:04.200
I didn't know what's wrong with them.
I didn't realize it.
And then I a guy,

167
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.010
a guy who's married to a comic or was,
I don't know anymore,

168
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.630
cause I've seen him in awhile,
but he was like,
hey man,
uh,

169
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.110
he saw me at an audition.
He was like,
you get pissed.
Like we,

170
00:10:15.111 --> 00:10:18.240
Christina gets something and you don't get it.
And I go,

171
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.430
he goes,
Oh shit,
have my problem.

172
00:10:23.431 --> 00:10:27.370
And I get super pissed when my wife gets something.
I was like,
wow,

173
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.430
I need to go to a doctor.

174
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.120
But that's a natural reaction with a lot of people that have never thought about

175
00:10:33.121 --> 00:10:37.110
that thinking while a lot of people's thinking just operates on momentum and you

176
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:39.920
know,
you might say,
oh that guy's an asshole and they might be an asshole.

177
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.210
And all respects because of the way they behave.

178
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.200
But it's the past that get you on a thinking like that that are the real
problem.

179
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:46.680
Right.

180
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.920
It's like a lot of people when they do asshole was shit while they're doing the

181
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:54.880
asshole is shit the barely even aware that they're doing it.
You know,

182
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.480
they have something wrong with them.
Whatever it is emotionally,

183
00:10:57.481 --> 00:11:00.270
whatever is an imbalance.
And it just comes out like that,

184
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.690
but a lot of it is just like,
how do you dad,
you get to that,

185
00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:06.660
like how do you think about things like what is your choice that you make?

186
00:11:06.661 --> 00:11:11.520
Like when someone,
if do you feel if you feel guilt or you feel rather,

187
00:11:11.521 --> 00:11:13.530
I'm not guilt,
those jealousy.

188
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.320
If you feel jealousy that because your spouse got something,

189
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.790
if you feel that like you should,
you should repel that.

190
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.450
We should figure out what the fuck is wrong with that and go,
no,
no,
no.

191
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.830
This should be inspiring.
This should be wonderful.
This should be fantastic.

192
00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:32.340
Like you,
whatever it is that's trying to flare up it's ugly green head.

193
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.870
You've got to learn how to suppress that.

194
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.930
Some people never do or explore why the feeling is yes.

195
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.590
Usually when you're jealous of something someone else is doing,

196
00:11:40.591 --> 00:11:44.190
it's because you want that thing and maybe you're not doing what you need to be

197
00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:48.090
doing.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
There's a lot of that for sure,

198
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:49.710
but I think there's a few elements.

199
00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:53.920
I think there's also just a natural competitive element that a lot of people

200
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:57.170
have to fight off if they don't realize this person is not your enemy just

201
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.930
because this person is winning,
you know,

202
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:01.300
this person is not your enemy because they're ahead of you in this race.

203
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.540
That's just inspiration.
That's just a person.
Like if you,

204
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:08.880
if you decide to create a gang of enemies for everybody,
that's you can do it,

205
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.270
you can do it,
or you can have a gang of friends and just inspire each other.

206
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.830
That's totally possible as well with the same group of people if everybody gets

207
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:19.060
their shit together.
Yeah.

208
00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:23.530
We were just talking about kind of the atmosphere that you fostered by being

209
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:26.860
supportive of other comedians and that's actually very rare.

210
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.140
I don't think a lot of people are secure enough,

211
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:33.220
but it's also indicative of that and it's awesome of we were talking about is

212
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:35.890
it's indicative of successful truce.

213
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:40.950
Truly successful people try to make other people inspire other people to be

214
00:12:41.831 --> 00:12:45.010
successful.
In other words,
they're not afraid of,

215
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.990
of bringing people along and trying to encourage their success.
Well,

216
00:12:49.991 --> 00:12:52.340
a lot of people are afraid of losing their gig.
You know,

217
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.610
a lot of people are afraid of someone bumping them out.

218
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.210
But I've got a lot of gigs.
I just keep doing different shit,
you know,
and I,

219
00:12:58.211 --> 00:13:00.790
and if I didn't do any of these things,
I'll find something else to do.

220
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.530
There's a lot of shit out there to do,
man.

221
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.080
Like if you get tripped up on what other people are doing,

222
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.090
you're missing out on your own life.

223
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.650
You got to look at everybody who's doing something awesome and go,
fuck yeah,

224
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.170
that's what you gotta do.
You gotta go.
That can help me.

225
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.910
I see this mother fucker out there humping.

226
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.080
When I find out about a guy like who's like a really hard worker,

227
00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:24.220
like a Daniel Tosh who's like,
you know,
Daniel Tosh is like a super hard worker.

228
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:24.870
Yeah,

229
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.450
I put it like he and I had this conversation because he got accused of being a

230
00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:32.020
lazy writer during that whole heckler thing.

231
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:35.620
Someone called him a late,
someone called him lazy because of that whole,

232
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:39.280
you know that all heckler thing where some woman yelled out a rape has never

233
00:13:39.281 --> 00:13:42.190
funny.
It was wouldn't it be funny?
Five guys raped her right now,

234
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:49.090
but I described that on stage.
I'm like,
that's actually the move.

235
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.580
That's actually what you would do.
Like if you're a black belt in comedy,

236
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.850
it's the equivalent to the counter to the over committed Kamora the far side arm

237
00:13:55.851 --> 00:14:00.190
bar.
Like if you're doing Jujitsu and the guy tries to commit to a Kamora but he

238
00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:03.040
doesn't have control of his body spin around and take the far side arm bar.

239
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.630
It's a standard move.
If you know Jujitsu,
it's,
it's,
it's the black belt move.

240
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.730
This is the black belt move in a comedy club.

241
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.740
If someone says rape has never funny,
like Oh God,

242
00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:15.820
you sanctimonious self righteous fuck head.
I didn't know.

243
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.750
I thought it was hilarious.
How stupid are you?

244
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.050
You're making a statement that's so ridiculous.
A course.
It's never funny,

245
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.410
but it's funny right there because he just made it funny.

246
00:14:26.411 --> 00:14:29.150
It's not the actual rape,
but the use of the word.
Sure.

247
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.850
Then he got accused of being lazy.

248
00:14:30.851 --> 00:14:35.680
That fucking guy is the least lazy person I know.
He pumps it when I go to,

249
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.380
he doesn't go there as much anymore,
but for a long time,

250
00:14:38.381 --> 00:14:40.600
every time I would go to her,
most of the beach,

251
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.360
he used to live really close to the club.

252
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.840
He would come in and I'm saying like if I did five spots in a row there,

253
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:54.050
he would have fucking five pages of notes and try new jokes.

254
00:14:54.051 --> 00:14:57.730
Every single set.
Yeah.
He's always working moms,
anybody you call that guys away.

255
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.090
But my point was that I see a guy like that and I get totally fired up to work.

256
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.450
I get,
I get fired up to see,
like if I see someone have a new set,

257
00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.550
like if a new guy comes in town,
like the Chappelle,

258
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.220
he used to come to the store all the time and he would come and he'd watch them

259
00:15:10.221 --> 00:15:13.550
do like an hour and just eat.
God,
I want to go.
Right.
Yeah.
You know,

260
00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.330
I just immediately want to go.
Right?
And that's,
that's a,

261
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.300
that's a super important thing for artists.
You know,

262
00:15:20.301 --> 00:15:24.800
you can really waste a lot of energy on that jealousy thing.

263
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.950
It's super easy to do.
And here's the thing though,

264
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.260
it doesn't just waste time.

265
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:35.680
It doesn't just waste thinking because it takes away from that time and that

266
00:15:35.841 --> 00:15:38.420
thinking from really good shit you could have been doing,

267
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.150
you could have been busting your ass writing new jokes.
Yeah.

268
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.550
You could have been thinking about how to improve yourself.

269
00:15:43.551 --> 00:15:45.380
You had been reading a book on,
you know,

270
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.740
accepting like a new empowering philosophy in your life.

271
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.420
You could have been doing so many different things.
Yeah.

272
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.000
Instead of like tripping out about somebody else.
Yeah.

273
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.770
But you see it all the time.
He's all like,
it's so,
it's essentially,
you know,

274
00:15:57.771 --> 00:15:59.540
it's,
it's like when you,

275
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:02.630
when people are like writing like these really critical blogs.

276
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.290
<v 3>Oh,
that one makes me bananas.</v>

277
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.020
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean they're essentially doing the same thing.
Yeah.</v>

278
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.710
They're essentially doing the same thing because nobody,

279
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.970
nobody is writing like these super hyper critical blogs.
Nobody in the house.

280
00:16:12.971 --> 00:16:15.080
People like happy and those people successful.
Yeah.

281
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.340
I like these weird that in this weird limbo rush and say none of them.
I said,

282
00:16:18.341 --> 00:16:22.030
I hate generalizations and I mean,
yeah,
I'm a hypocrite.
Well,
it's kind of like,

283
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:26.880
it's,
it's a little bit of that to exist in like a disproportionate criticism.

284
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:30.220
Yeah.
But like almost like to go out of your way to like,
you know,

285
00:16:30.221 --> 00:16:34.740
tag a youtube video as you know,
how much you hate it.
You're like,
oh,

286
00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.810
it's really not a bad video.
You know,
it's about other things.

287
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.840
Sometimes it is though.
Well,
yeah,
sometimes it's about that big.
Sometimes it is,

288
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.060
but sometimes it's not.

289
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:48.330
Sometimes it's not the sheer volume of shit that's on the Internet and you lose

290
00:16:48.371 --> 00:16:52.480
your power.
Sound disconnect.
Here we go,
here we go.

291
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:57.730
The sheer volume of,
of,
of Shit that's on the Internet now.
I've been,
you know,

292
00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.140
been writing this bit.

293
00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.400
I've been doing this bit on stage lately about the evolution of porn from when I

294
00:17:03.401 --> 00:17:06.840
was a child,
but it's just,
I,
I,

295
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:11.940
it's hard for me to stop and think about a time where nothing came to you from

296
00:17:12.311 --> 00:17:15.730
the Internet.
Right.
But I live,
I grew up in that time.
Right.

297
00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:19.090
That was how I grew up or your life and yeah,
most of my life.

298
00:17:19.091 --> 00:17:21.170
And so now when I look at it,
it's,

299
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.700
it's just become this normal part of my everyday existence.

300
00:17:24.701 --> 00:17:26.620
But for kids,

301
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:31.590
I can't imagine growing up with it.
It's so,
it's such a,

302
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:34.990
<v 3>Oh,
out of information they get an,
actually,</v>

303
00:17:34.991 --> 00:17:38.230
let's go back to this pornography thing cause we were just talking about that.

304
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:43.150
Um,
like the stuff that I saw first,
like from the 80s,
like Ron,
Jeremy,

305
00:17:43.151 --> 00:17:47.770
I grew up our Ron Jeremy Full Bush.
Like it was always playful scenarios.

306
00:17:47.771 --> 00:17:52.560
Like here's a fork lift,
let's on it.
Yeah.
And now I feel like it's so aggressive.

307
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:57.120
Yeah.
And it's,
it doesn't feel consensual and fun as it did in the 70.
[inaudible]

308
00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.480
<v 0>well,
there's still some things and stuff,</v>

309
00:17:59.481 --> 00:18:03.020
but the problem is the aggressive stuff is really popular.
Sales Rep,

310
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.660
it's not the most popular thing,
but it's just,

311
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.220
it's so shocking that you focus on it.
Like you find it,
you go,
Jesus Christ,

312
00:18:10.221 --> 00:18:13.510
like some of these,
I watched this Sasha grey video.
Yeah.

313
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:18.300
It was just like this blow job,
Gang Bang,
and I was like,
wow,
how does it,

314
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.320
where's a person's head at while all these different guys are just balls deep in

315
00:18:23.961 --> 00:18:26.780
her face,
throat,
fucking fucking.

316
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.420
And she's like telling him how much his ball stinks and ask him if he ever

317
00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.410
washes his fucking balls.
Then she spits on his dick and just,

318
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.040
but it's like God damn like this.

319
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.410
That's a totally different thing than one of those 1380s Ron,

320
00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:46.380
Jeremy,
you know,
soft,
softer era porn.

321
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.730
Just good filmmaking right there.
Yeah.

322
00:18:48.731 --> 00:18:50.960
I mean those people back then were fucking,
yeah,
they were,

323
00:18:50.961 --> 00:18:53.490
they were having sex and everything.
It was all that.
But there's,

324
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.050
there's such a difference between that and like this,

325
00:18:57.051 --> 00:19:01.040
this thing they're doing now,
every guys on like 15 pills,

326
00:19:01.041 --> 00:19:05.090
a viagara their dicks or crowbars.
I mean the date they did,

327
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.120
their dicks never go lamp and they just stick it everywhere.
The mouth.

328
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:12.960
<v 3>That's what I'm saying.
It doesn't end.</v>

329
00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:17.010
It felt like the Nina heart back then that those women were like,

330
00:19:17.011 --> 00:19:21.420
I love sex on pro sex and let's make these movies.
What do you think that is?

331
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:22.463
What is,

332
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.750
<v 0>why is it like that?
Like what do you think,
what was it like or why is it,</v>

333
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.520
why did that become a genre?
Like when it didn't exist initially?

334
00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.460
Why is it a genre now?
What does Russian thing,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

335
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.470
<v 3>Cause it's a part of humanity that needs to be expressed and now it is.</v>

336
00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:41.310
And it's like you said,
there's a bit of a taboo attached maybe.
I don't know.

337
00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:44.080
And Yeah,
I think that draws eyeballs.
A lot of it

338
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.760
<v 4>does.
It has cha I remember I did a joke about it,
uh,
on my,
uh,</v>

339
00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:53.910
thrilled CD about eighties born and then a porn star heard it and wrote to me

340
00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.970
from the 80s.
And she was like,
yeah,
when we did porn back then it was like,

341
00:19:57.971 --> 00:20:02.020
we were,
uh,
we were like a fam,
not,
you know,
incestuous,
but like,
it was like,

342
00:20:02.021 --> 00:20:06.070
we all did it and we,
you know,
you were buddies with like the sound guy,

343
00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:10.540
like almost like,
what's that fucking movie?
Um,
the Dirk Diggler Boogie Nights,

344
00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:10.851
right?

345
00:20:10.851 --> 00:20:15.460
Like everybody knew each other and it was like you knew that camp real well and

346
00:20:15.461 --> 00:20:20.200
I think it was probably a lot,
lot fewer people doing it because there's no,

347
00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.160
you know,
he released it on film at that point,
you know like yeah.

348
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.510
And then now it's like hold up your,
you know,

349
00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.110
handheld camera to shoot a fucking thousand scenes a day and everybody knows you

350
00:20:32.111 --> 00:20:35.590
can put it online and you have,
you got to,
you got to tap into a market.
Right.

351
00:20:35.591 --> 00:20:39.430
So there's different genres and it's all about just creating as much content as

352
00:20:39.431 --> 00:20:42.280
possible and hitting every realm of,

353
00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.830
of sexuality that you can't even imagine.

354
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.100
There's not even porn stars anymore if you'd like.
Back in the day everyone

355
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.960
<v 3>had their porn stars like there Jenna Jamison,</v>

356
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.830
stuff like nowadays there's so many girls doing it because of like,
you know,

357
00:20:53.831 --> 00:20:55.300
cam sites and stuff like that.

358
00:20:55.510 --> 00:21:00.370
That seems like it's just diluted the whole entire waters of and the tube sites

359
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.770
like have been crushing that business.
Yeah.

360
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.480
<v 2>What I understand,
it's funny because that business is a legit business.</v>

361
00:21:06.481 --> 00:21:08.430
It was making billions of dollars a year.

362
00:21:08.431 --> 00:21:13.431
It was totally legal and yet when the economy collapsed and the Internet came

363
00:21:14.221 --> 00:21:18.150
along and socked porn dry,
like you know,

364
00:21:18.151 --> 00:21:21.390
literally like porns dead.
Like as far as like the,

365
00:21:21.391 --> 00:21:23.730
the amount of money those guys used to make producing it.

366
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.570
I mean these to sell DVDs,
DVDs would sell a lot.

367
00:21:27.571 --> 00:21:32.270
I'm like $50 DVDs.
Right?
There's like expensive.
Yeah.
That,
that business is still,

368
00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.870
he's still exists to a certain extent,

369
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.370
but a lot of it is evaporated and because it's evaporated,
you know,

370
00:21:38.371 --> 00:21:40.830
it's the businesses,
you know,
it's been hit hard,

371
00:21:40.831 --> 00:21:44.190
but nobody ever thinks about bailing out the porn business.

372
00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.480
That is the last thing that the government would ever do.
Yeah.

373
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.130
I mean if you think about like you're trying to protect the economy and

374
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.240
different businesses or you know,
critical to the economy.
Yes.

375
00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.950
Porn might be critical to the economy of Americans.
Definitely.
Definitely Devon.

376
00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.400
But why the multiple Dick thing?
Why like,

377
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:07.230
yeah,
like the,
the aggression and maybe it has something to

378
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.630
<v 3>do about our,
we were pressing aggression in society.
And is that why it's coming?</v>

379
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.790
<v 2>Well,
we definitely have doing that,
especially if people don't exercise.</v>

380
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.310
There you go.
We're definitely doing that because we're,

381
00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:21.390
we're moving towards an error where it won't be necessary anymore.

382
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.090
We're aggression won't be necessary anymore.
I really believe that.

383
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:28.890
I think that that's ultimately what's the reason why people were avoiding the

384
00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:33.120
white,
they're a bore of violence and why they,
the,
the,
the heat,
you know,

385
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.480
all the,
the evil aspects of life like war.

386
00:22:36.481 --> 00:22:38.350
The reason why all that is because I think the,

387
00:22:38.351 --> 00:22:43.050
the human mind as a whole recognizes that it's operating on some really old

388
00:22:43.051 --> 00:22:44.680
ideas that it doesn't need to do anymore.

389
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.090
And eventually we're going to move towards a point where there's some sort of

390
00:22:48.091 --> 00:22:52.110
complete consolidation of the human race as far as like our ability to

391
00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.160
communicate with each other and our ability to,
I think we're,

392
00:22:56.161 --> 00:23:00.420
we're moving towards like this,
this time of not doing all that stuff.

393
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.370
I think it's,
it's pretty clear.
I know.

394
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:06.220
<v 3>Tell you though.
I mean,
have you,
have you done the Middle East?
No.
No,</v>

395
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.920
I'm not going over there.
I know.
See and that reaction is right.
Yeah.

396
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:14.300
Cause I've been there like two times and I,
part of me goes,
I hope.

397
00:23:14.301 --> 00:23:17.600
I sure hope the human race gets it together and we can communicate and then you

398
00:23:17.601 --> 00:23:22.520
go.
Some cultures are so incompatible with our western way of being.

399
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.620
Yeah.
Like will we ever be able to,

400
00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.500
<v 2>I think the Internet is going to open all that shit up.
I really do.</v>

401
00:23:27.501 --> 00:23:28.880
I think it's only a matter of time.

402
00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:32.060
I think he can't hold it back for more than a generation or two.

403
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.270
I think eventually it's just going to overwhelm it.
Right.

404
00:23:35.271 --> 00:23:38.990
The places that it's being kind of repressed now will eventually,
yeah,

405
00:23:38.991 --> 00:23:40.280
you can't stop it.
Well,
you know what?

406
00:23:40.281 --> 00:23:44.060
You're not gonna be able to stop the death of religion.
Never.
Not going to stop

407
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.100
<v 3>is a fundamental need</v>

408
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.910
<v 2>to want something bigger than yourself to fear death so much that you need that.</v>

409
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.590
Yeah.
I was actually saying no,
he's not going to stop the the death of religion.

410
00:23:54.591 --> 00:23:58.160
It won't exist in the future.
Oh,
right,
right,
right,
right,
right,
right.

411
00:23:58.161 --> 00:23:59.750
You don't agree with it.
Well,
so he's going to be,

412
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.240
<v 3>I don't know if humans will.
The thing is,</v>

413
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:05.600
is that humans are fundamentally afraid of,
they're afraid of dying.
Right?

414
00:24:05.601 --> 00:24:08.670
There's the death drive and the sex drive is Freud said.
Yeah.

415
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.360
And I think that humans are so afraid of,

416
00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.360
of the unknown of the part we don't know.

417
00:24:14.361 --> 00:24:17.570
And then that's a great comfort and it's existed since we've existed.

418
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.610
<v 2>Yeah.
It will always exist.
God,</v>

419
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.610
I think that's just the sense of wonder and also the,
the,

420
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.900
the knowledge that we're finite,
you know,
that freaks us out.
That's terrifying.

421
00:24:26.901 --> 00:24:30.680
So in a sense,
I agree with you and definitely the sense of people replace it.

422
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:35.030
So if it's not going to be God,
then it's going to be like spirituality and yoga.

423
00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.550
That's what I am.
That's why my center,

424
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:42.080
I just feel the oneness of the universe or if you've done mushrooms,
he got,

425
00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:45.540
Oh okay,
this might get real weird.
Yeah.

426
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.670
Cause I think that new age Oprah stuff is replacing traditional religion.

427
00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.970
It would be all replaced by mushrooms.
If there were legal,
all those dummies,

428
00:24:52.971 --> 00:24:56.960
you'd be out of business.
Deepak Chopra out of business just from all of them.

429
00:24:56.961 --> 00:24:59.540
Fuck yeah.
The philosophy of the world would change.

430
00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.660
We were talking about illegal legal rather.
I think you can,

431
00:25:02.661 --> 00:25:07.640
you get a totally different perspective on religion when you live in an era

432
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.560
where a new religion finds great success.
Yeah.

433
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.770
You get to see like seeing Scientology,
you know,

434
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.710
I wasn't there for like the actual inception of but like seeing how it has

435
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:22.610
progressed and grown and seeing everybody's views towards it.

436
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:27.110
You have to imagine that there's a lot of parallels for what,
how you ever,

437
00:25:27.111 --> 00:25:31.490
you view that and if you go back 2000 years and seeing Christianity evolve

438
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:34.020
absolutely be very similar.
Absolutely.

439
00:25:34.021 --> 00:25:36.870
Except the distribution of information as much as much for it.

440
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.250
Back then it was much more secretive and you know when Constantine and all those

441
00:25:40.251 --> 00:25:42.970
bishops got together and created the New Testament,
you know,
they,

442
00:25:42.971 --> 00:25:46.450
they got to decide,
people got decide what stays and what goes out.
Yeah.
You know,

443
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:50.090
they got to sign what they put in and say let's just come on.

444
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:54.270
But it makes you want like when you go,
cause you,
you hear a lot of,
you know,

445
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:58.550
people obviously be hypercritical of Scientology and you go,
this is absurd.

446
00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.980
You know,
you could,
they criticize everything about it and you go,

447
00:26:00.981 --> 00:26:05.750
well if you go back,
you know,
how,
how is your thing more valuable?

448
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:10.560
Catholic Church tithing,
people are talking about angels and saints,
you know,
and,

449
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.730
and immaculate conception is like,
well we were like,
yeah,
but that's,

450
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.830
we've been doing that for a couple of thousand years.

451
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.500
That's the only argument is that it's way older.

452
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:23.060
Does a new scholar that claims or a new published work by the scholar there

453
00:26:23.061 --> 00:26:26.800
claims that Jesus was a creation and that uh,
the,

454
00:26:26.801 --> 00:26:30.590
the Romans made him up as a hoax?
Yeah.

455
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.920
He's the author of a book entitled Caesar's Messiah,

456
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:38.000
the Roman conspiracy to invent Jesus.
It starts at Christianity,

457
00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:39.380
did not begin as a religion,

458
00:26:39.381 --> 00:26:44.370
but was actually a sophisticated government propaganda exercise to pacify

459
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:49.140
subjects of the Roman Empire has taken.
Jesus is not new.

460
00:26:49.141 --> 00:26:50.760
Apparently in 1844,

461
00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:53.940
Karl Marx famously declared that religion is the opiate of the masses.

462
00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.920
History is filled with skeptics,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Um,
it's based on,
uh,

463
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:03.000
what he described as an important really revealing parallels between a first

464
00:27:03.001 --> 00:27:05.970
person account of first century Judea,

465
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.230
which was an ancient Roman province known,
uh,
uh,

466
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:14.270
now a part of Israel and Palestine and the new testament sequence of events,

467
00:27:14.281 --> 00:27:18.450
locations in Jesus' ministry are more or less the same as the sequence of events

468
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.720
and locations of the military campaign of Emperor Titus Flavius as described by

469
00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:29.160
Joseph us.
Josephus at will wrote in a blog on his website.

470
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:33.220
<v 0>Is it cool that they were like Josephus?
That would have been your name.</v>

471
00:27:33.221 --> 00:27:35.820
That would have been my name or it would be your name if you live in like

472
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:36.663
Virginia.

473
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:40.870
This Josephus Josephus makes the moonshine.

474
00:27:40.871 --> 00:27:44.060
There's Moonshine you can buy at a store,
but that's bullshit ass tech.

475
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:47.320
You want to get it from Josephus?
We got to use Hecker.

476
00:27:47.321 --> 00:27:51.310
Would you don't use hickory will.
You ain't making good moonshine.

477
00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:55.320
I like a little peach sometime.
Little Peach would pizza,
hardwood,

478
00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.600
preach the hardwood tickled and popcorn and Josephus,

479
00:27:58.601 --> 00:28:03.210
we'll get you what you need.
It's all,
who knows whether or not this guy,
but,

480
00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:06.360
but it makes sense.
It makes sense what you're saying that yeah,

481
00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:10.510
we need to see like something like Scientology in our lifetime where you know,

482
00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:14.110
oh,
it's l,
Ron Hubbard the fuck I've lived.
There's photos of 'em.
Very yes.

483
00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:19.390
And then you read the other shit that he wrote and you go,
hold on a minute,

484
00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:25.390
hold on a minute.
This,
wait.
No way anyone can start one of these

485
00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:30.010
<v 2>dynamics book in the mail.
I ordered it because when I first moved to California,</v>

486
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:34.200
I was uh,
you know,
watching TV late at night.
Yeah.
You know,

487
00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:38.300
it's like first time living out here and didn't know anybody that size is,

488
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.700
spend a lot of time watching TV.

489
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.650
And now there was an ad for dianetics improved on my Tammy or get some dianetics

490
00:28:43.651 --> 00:28:48.010
approved my fucking life.
I didn't know dianetics Scientology.
So,
uh,
you know,

491
00:28:48.011 --> 00:28:51.430
I buy the book when it comes to my house and I'm like leaf through it a little

492
00:28:51.431 --> 00:28:54.300
bit.
It seems interesting ideas they have.
And then,

493
00:28:54.301 --> 00:28:59.200
and these motherfuckers never stopped trying to get me to join.

494
00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:01.180
Really.
They send you these things in the mail,

495
00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:03.150
they would send you these things in the mail constantly,

496
00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.700
like some new thing and some new offer and come down here and get a personality

497
00:29:06.701 --> 00:29:10.870
test.
And d they are like very diligently netlists they're very diligent.
They,

498
00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.520
you know,
and someone who,
you know,

499
00:29:12.521 --> 00:29:16.570
is this 94 someone who would buy one of those books because I'm trying to get

500
00:29:16.571 --> 00:29:17.404
your shit together.

501
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:20.200
Those are the type of people that you would really want to target.
You know,

502
00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:25.620
if you want to have a nice group of people that you can control the vulnerable

503
00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.490
when you're at your lowest.
Right.

504
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:32.640
I was in San Diego filming a show and there was a right by where we were

505
00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:37.330
filming.
There was one of those personality tests,
stress tests and the meter.

506
00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.740
And I went over there and uh,
I took it,
you know,
the sat down.

507
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.490
<v 0>It was,
it was interesting because,
um,
I got a nice read from him.</v>

508
00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:48.060
The guy was like in his fifties,
he had no idea who the fuck I was.
Yeah.

509
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.310
So it was perfect.
So,
uh,
I sat down with the guy,
you know,

510
00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:54.580
there wasn't any weirdness,
you know,
like,
Hey,
this fear factor coming back.

511
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.450
It was just some old due to it knowing what do you do?
And uh,

512
00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:59.590
I forgot what I told them.

513
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:03.790
I don't think I told him the truth or I told them a version of the truth.

514
00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.930
So I am holding these things.
He's asking me questions about like my childhood.

515
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.200
Like,
did you ever have a cat that died?
Like shit like that.
And I'm like,

516
00:30:11.201 --> 00:30:13.720
this is hilarious.
And I'm like,
what happens?
These,

517
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.000
these tubes are telling you what,
what,
what are they telling you?

518
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.780
And he's like a reading that goes through these camps,

519
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:20.020
their cure holding on the cans.

520
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.310
They're like coffee cans and he's on the other end of them.

521
00:30:22.311 --> 00:30:24.520
There was a wire and it's attached to a machine.

522
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.550
It's supposed to read your stress.
Yeah.

523
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:31.060
And from that they can sort of give an assessment of,
you know,

524
00:30:31.061 --> 00:30:32.980
and then they prescribed Scientology.

525
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:39.370
Any grams are some things where I don't understand that scarred from certain

526
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:43.420
moments of your life.
And then they go back and try to undo the scarring.
Yes.

527
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.640
He told you what was wrong with you though?
Was he like,

528
00:30:45.641 --> 00:30:50.560
here's what I'm just pretty normally so,
so I could do cytology though.
Yeah,

529
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:54.970
of course.
Assistant.
Well you know,

530
00:30:54.971 --> 00:30:59.971
I think the deal with like Scientology or anything where a lot of successful

531
00:31:00.341 --> 00:31:03.930
people are a part of it though.
Like John Travolta and Tom Cruise,

532
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:08.500
Tom Cruise especially is very ultra successful movie star and obviously you're a

533
00:31:08.501 --> 00:31:12.460
very driven guy.
So you see him being a part of something like that and you go,

534
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.910
oh well this is obviously doing this guy like a lot of good.

535
00:31:15.911 --> 00:31:20.680
He's super confident and he's like really positive and radiant with his smile.

536
00:31:20.681 --> 00:31:24.360
And you're like,
well at this,
if it works for this guy was so fired up.
Yeah.

537
00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:25.540
I mean if it works for him,

538
00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:29.260
like maybe it's not so bad because you don't see like any Mormons that are like

539
00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:34.120
super ultra pumped fucking Mormon.
They keep that same kind of on the DL.

540
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:37.480
It's sketchy.

541
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:41.950
Like when you know that when fuck head was running for president when Romney was

542
00:31:41.951 --> 00:31:45.250
running for president and it came out that not was he just Mormon,

543
00:31:45.251 --> 00:31:48.910
but he was from a sec that broke away from the United States because they wanted

544
00:31:48.911 --> 00:31:53.680
polygamy,
so they set up a compound in Mexico.
Everybody's like,
dude,

545
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:56.410
that's a wrap that you take care.

546
00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.060
Oh 40 and then 47% comment too.
Oh,
right,
right,
right.

547
00:32:00.061 --> 00:32:02.320
But than not going to vote for him anyway.
Yeah.

548
00:32:02.321 --> 00:32:05.290
Those two things were big that you can't,

549
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.800
your dad was born in Mexico.
His Dad was born in Mexico.

550
00:32:08.801 --> 00:32:10.330
That's why his dad could never be president.

551
00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:11.830
That's why he was running for president.

552
00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.980
He was born in America's dad is a Mexican,

553
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:20.020
like from Mexico because of Mormonism,
because they all moved down to Mexico.

554
00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:22.230
They denounce US citizenship.
Wow.

555
00:32:22.231 --> 00:32:26.310
So that he can fucking set up a compound where they could just ball.
Yeah.

556
00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.470
Just wanted eight nine why's.
He wanted to not be locked up.

557
00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.910
Can I tell you I love that show and you ever seen,
I don't watch it frequently.

558
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.740
What does this do?
The Mormon show,
all the wives,
sister wives.
Oh,
the HBO show.

559
00:32:38.741 --> 00:32:39.980
I don't think it's only right.
Ah,

560
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.740
<v 3>you miss it.
You're talking about a reality show.
Like,
oh,</v>

561
00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.750
it was a reality show because I don't Dunno if you've seen the wives,

562
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:48.780
but my favorite part of the show is that,
you know,
this guy was like,

563
00:32:48.781 --> 00:32:51.930
this is going to be awesome.
I'm going to get five hot ass chicks,

564
00:32:51.931 --> 00:32:56.730
we're going to be doing orgies.
And they're all so fat and out of shape.

565
00:32:56.731 --> 00:33:00.110
Like their sister peg,
right?
Yeah.
There are the pigs and,

566
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.960
and it's so great cause like it's totally the opposite of what he wanted because

567
00:33:03.961 --> 00:33:06.120
they pump out kids every year.
And of course,

568
00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:09.570
like they know that's what he wanted,
I imagine because you know why?

569
00:33:09.571 --> 00:33:11.490
Because he gets a younger,
a hotter model,

570
00:33:11.491 --> 00:33:16.491
like every five years they allow him to get like a 27 year old balloons.

571
00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:19.470
Right.
Where the chorus is dark,
deep.
Pretty good.
Lookers.
Yeah.

572
00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.380
There's other girls are probably poisoning when she sleeps for sure.

573
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:26.350
I want to keep a fat for sure.
Yeah.
Right.
I think vice,
yeah.

574
00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.680
<v 2>Did,
um,
at least on,
on their youtube channel.</v>

575
00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:35.010
I think they did a profile on a Romney's Mexican past.

576
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:36.791
Yeah.

577
00:33:36.791 --> 00:33:41.050
And well they definitely did because Shane Smith came on the show and told us

578
00:33:41.051 --> 00:33:43.510
about it.
It was pretty awesome.
What they did was awesome.
Yeah.

579
00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:45.970
Well they're bad ass advices gangster.

580
00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:51.010
They go everywhere there what the journalism world had been needing for a long,

581
00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:53.950
long time.
Yeah.
Like there and you know,
they get a lot of heat,

582
00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.540
they get a lot of heat from the New York Times.

583
00:33:55.541 --> 00:33:58.500
You've got to eat a lot of heat from legit journalists that like somehow that

584
00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:01.190
didn't think that their work was up to standard.
Look,

585
00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:02.650
you guys are being silly bitches.

586
00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:06.210
They had introduced a lot of people to a lot of really crazy shit that may,

587
00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:06.971
they may be,
they not,

588
00:34:06.971 --> 00:34:09.790
wouldn't have known about it and they cover everything there informing them the

589
00:34:09.791 --> 00:34:12.760
garbage patch in the middle of Pacific to what's going on in North Korea.

590
00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.450
I mean they went to North Korea and fucking with everybody and ate dinner and

591
00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.970
they were traveling around in North Korea filming this.
I remember.

592
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:23.320
It was awesome.
It gives zero fucks.
Yeah.
That Shane Smith is a bad motherfucker.

593
00:34:23.321 --> 00:34:25.810
He goes to Africa and hangs out with the cannibals.
Yeah.

594
00:34:25.811 --> 00:34:27.480
He's hanging out with the Liberian cannibals,

595
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.470
the guys talking to them about eating babies,

596
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:33.070
how he's killed the innocent children of the enemy and eats their heart,

597
00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:36.130
eat their heart and drink their blood because it makes an invincible general

598
00:34:36.131 --> 00:34:40.450
buck naked.
This guy used to fight naked.
They call them general buck naked.
Whoa.

599
00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.510
He's killed thousands of people and he got away with it because he became a

600
00:34:43.511 --> 00:34:48.160
Christian.
So when they became a Christian they absolve him of his crimes.
Wow.

601
00:34:48.161 --> 00:34:52.750
Lucky.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fascinating to how that works.
Vice was right there,
man.

602
00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.180
Right there.
Covered that fascinating shit.

603
00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:57.250
They were and they were in North Korea.

604
00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:01.990
They did an awesome profile in North Korea before Kim Jong Il died.
Yeah.

605
00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:05.530
And like seeing how they got in and like the,

606
00:35:05.531 --> 00:35:10.531
the reality of like being in the capital city in Pyongyang and like the way the

607
00:35:11.351 --> 00:35:12.040
hotel,

608
00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.940
like everybody was like basically you felt like they were just being watched.

609
00:35:15.941 --> 00:35:18.760
There were being spied on by everybody and what they were like,
you know,

610
00:35:18.761 --> 00:35:22.790
they brought them the food and he said,
you know what I mean?
Like to,
yeah,

611
00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:26.130
like lay out the red carpet for them.
But it was basically all unedible.

612
00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.740
I think he said like it wasn't good stuff and then they took everything away.

613
00:35:29.741 --> 00:35:33.400
Nobody else was eating,
but there's no one else in the restaurant.
No one else.

614
00:35:33.401 --> 00:35:35.890
They pretended it was a restaurant.
Right.
But it wasn't a restaurant.

615
00:35:35.891 --> 00:35:38.040
They just set it up.
They set up where they were going

616
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.980
<v 0>to cook for them and made it look like a restaurant.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

617
00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:44.250
There was no one else there did it?
Look,
we didn't have a good life over here,

618
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.930
the movie studio,
and they were like,

619
00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:51.030
we've done like the Kim Jong Un's directed like 800 video stuff,

620
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.570
but he consulted on 13,000 I mean it was like,
wow,
that's a lot of movies.

621
00:35:54.571 --> 00:35:58.260
He's like,
yeah,
he's amazing.
Consulting 13,000 rupees.

622
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.650
Lisa Ling did ages ago.
It's on Netflix.

623
00:36:01.651 --> 00:36:06.060
I watch that a while back and some guy escaped who worked in the guard tower.

624
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:09.780
Did you ever see this?
He got out of North Korea and he's like,

625
00:36:09.781 --> 00:36:11.640
the minute I got under a fence,

626
00:36:11.641 --> 00:36:15.680
the guy that he was with got trapped under the fence and died immediately,

627
00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.600
was electrocuted to death.
And he goes,

628
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:19.260
the minute I knew I got out of North Korea,

629
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:22.890
I knew that I had signed my family's death warrant because now they go after

630
00:36:22.891 --> 00:36:25.950
your family.
They put them in that.
What's that there area?
What is it like?

631
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:31.200
Yeah.
And he's like,
I just,
I fucked over my entire family.

632
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:35.220
And then how do you deal with that kind of a guilt?
I don't know.
Yeah,

633
00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.530
there's the big argument.

634
00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:40.800
If the United States was really trying to like clean up evil in the world,

635
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:46.210
that's the spot we hit.
Drama is as their pores.
Fuck they,

636
00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:50.490
we're really trying to liberate.
A lot of them are Ross,
you're right,
it's bad.

637
00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:55.740
They're scared.
Well,
you would have to fucking free these people first of all.

638
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.340
And then you would have to slowly sort of re indoctrinate them to the idea of

639
00:36:59.341 --> 00:37:00.960
freedom.
What they're,
they're,

640
00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:05.980
they're in one of the last great dictatorships and it's 2013 with the Internet

641
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:10.770
and everything and with your neighbor to the south who used to be connected to

642
00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:16.040
these to be your former countrymen or banging out cell phones and TVs and

643
00:37:16.771 --> 00:37:21.210
fucking massive electronics and cars and constructive things and all you bitches

644
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.000
have your lights out at night because you can't keep your electricity on.

645
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:27.930
Like if you wanted to see what works and what doesn't work as far as happiness

646
00:37:27.931 --> 00:37:31.920
and a good population,
you need look no further than South Korea,
North Korea.

647
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.150
There's a difference between living in a dictatorship and living in a democracy

648
00:37:36.151 --> 00:37:39.750
and this same country,
the same patch of land.

649
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:45.090
I mean it's this,
you can't control people.
They don't like it.
It doesn't work.

650
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:49.230
And it's sort of what we were talking about earlier about like the ideas of

651
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:53.880
being generous and helping and loving or being a fucking Weirdo.

652
00:37:53.881 --> 00:37:56.840
I was trying to control everything.
It's,
it applies to people,

653
00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:59.700
it applies to governments and applies to everything,
right?

654
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:02.160
You can't build walls to keep people in and out.

655
00:38:02.161 --> 00:38:04.020
Look what happened in east and West Germany.

656
00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:08.160
Same goes building laws to keep Mexicans out.
It doesn't work well.
It does work.

657
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.620
That's why there's a Mexico and that's why there's the United States.

658
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.950
Here's the question is,
is it a good idea?
It doesn't work totally.

659
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.720
You know what doesn't work 100% of the time,

660
00:38:15.721 --> 00:38:19.080
but it probably works 90% of the time.
You know,
if it was wide open,

661
00:38:19.081 --> 00:38:22.920
they'd probably be no one in Mexico.
That shit would empty out so quick.

662
00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:27.010
It would be,
oh my goodness.
With the quickness son,

663
00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:29.790
the United States,

664
00:38:29.791 --> 00:38:34.791
we'd double in population in a week and a lot of room in the Midwest don't.

665
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.040
Well,
there's people that would

666
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.010
<v 2>love,
I mean there's parts of Mexico that people love.
You know,</v>

667
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.960
it was a lot of people live in Mexico City.
They love it.

668
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:45.040
People would come up here and still lives in Mexico.
Yup.
Ken Kuhn.
He loves it.

669
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:48.820
She loves it.
He loves it.
He loves it.
I would,

670
00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:52.460
I think that we were trying to be like politically forward backfired.
Uh,

671
00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:55.570
the economy though.
People would come here to make money.
You know,

672
00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:00.460
that's why people would come.
Um,
yeah.
One of the economy and also the,
the,
I,

673
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.180
I see both sides of it.
I see the,

674
00:39:04.181 --> 00:39:09.181
the logic in controlling our economy and not allowing people and because it

675
00:39:09.221 --> 00:39:14.110
allows you to maintain at least one area and try to keep it viable.

676
00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:19.060
But the idea that somebody should be locked out just cause they shit out of luck

677
00:39:19.061 --> 00:39:24.061
and were born and some terrible impoverished town in Mexico and that they can't

678
00:39:24.611 --> 00:39:27.100
ever get out of there and come up to where it's awesome.

679
00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:32.560
That seems to me like the only reason why that would exist is because we as

680
00:39:32.561 --> 00:39:33.950
humans think that the,

681
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.330
the idea of managing the whole world is just too daunting a task.

682
00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:39.730
So we have to block it off in little chunks,

683
00:39:39.731 --> 00:39:44.020
apply philosophies in those chunks and then enforce the borders because like

684
00:39:44.021 --> 00:39:46.560
we're not ready to combine.
We're not ready to combine it.

685
00:39:46.561 --> 00:39:49.800
Cause if you're ready to combine the number one thing you gotta do is you've got

686
00:39:49.801 --> 00:39:52.310
to fix the poor spots you have to fix the poorest about.

687
00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:56.020
Don't you feel like one day we'll have it universal citizenship?

688
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:58.210
It won't be about,
yes.
Maybe.

689
00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:02.500
Is that it'll be passports will be a thing of the past.
It's possible.

690
00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.540
We would have to get over a lot of shit though,

691
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:07.330
and we'd have to like strengthen impoverished areas.

692
00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.210
There's gotta be a lot of money and rebuilding shitty neighborhoods,

693
00:40:10.211 --> 00:40:12.070
just like this is a lot of money and rebuilding things.

694
00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:14.350
They blow up in Iraq was going to say,
look at Iraq.

695
00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.390
I don't know if it's a success or not.

696
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:20.530
Just need to get Halbert involved in community centers.
That's a great idea.

697
00:40:20.531 --> 00:40:25.120
If Albert and got involved in community centers,
just rebuild Detroit.

698
00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.380
Oh my God,
the contracts should be billions.
The jobs would be intense.

699
00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:33.840
Be Amazing right now.
Yeah,
that'd be amazing.
Flint and Detroit,
I mean,

700
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.600
I don't understand why it's okay to build shit on other parts of the world that

701
00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:41.860
we blow up,
but not build shit that just fell apart on its own over here.
I agree.

702
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.600
We were in Detroit for a,

703
00:40:43.601 --> 00:40:48.601
that Scifi show and we went to Zug island and around that area and wow.

704
00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:54.190
It's depressing.
It's thinking buy a house for $100.

705
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:58.420
I'm not kidding.
Yeah,
I saw that.
Cause you know,

706
00:40:58.421 --> 00:41:00.100
the government just gave or loaned,

707
00:41:00.101 --> 00:41:04.960
I don't know which one of the two Detroit a lot of money.
Well it needs it.

708
00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.340
Yeah.
And they were saying that like,

709
00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:11.110
I mean there's just like little thing but like 40% of light posts,

710
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:16.360
you know,
don't work in Detroit in the greater metropolitan area.
It makes sense.

711
00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:17.050
Um,

712
00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:21.670
the average response time to a nine one one call is 58 minutes.

713
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.940
Oh my God.
So that means,
you know,
fire ambulance,
oh my God.

714
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:30.410
A long fucking time.
That's an average for an average.
Right.

715
00:41:30.411 --> 00:41:35.411
And what's really incredible is that town was created basically on the business

716
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:41.390
that was like one of the best businesses for the United States ever.

717
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:45.560
The automotive one point in time they were rocking.

718
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:50.710
My friend Justin was on the sh the podcast and he worked in the Ford factory for

719
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.690
years.
Chrysler factory.
Yeah.
And it was,
you know,
they could,

720
00:41:53.691 --> 00:41:55.490
people could make a good living,

721
00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:59.270
can support a family and they turned out these cars.
Yeah.

722
00:41:59.271 --> 00:42:01.610
But then when a member remember when like,
um,

723
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.850
well they all had the bailout for the auto companies.

724
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:10.150
The big thing was that I think those guys overextended themselves with the,

725
00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.370
like the offers of their benefits because the whole thing was like,

726
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:20.440
I think it was 20 or 30 years,
I think maybe it was 30 years.
Yeah.

727
00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:25.490
And then you got like full,
you know,
incredible benefits.

728
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:31.120
And so you had essentially a lot of people that could retire at 50.

729
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:35.810
Right.
And that's what one of the main things of why,
you know,

730
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:38.900
so that's why they were losing money because he had to pay these guys
eventually.

731
00:42:38.901 --> 00:42:39.530
I mean,
you know,

732
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:43.430
the automotive industry became more competitive so they're not as dominant and,

733
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.181
but then yeah,

734
00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:48.710
one of the things that they said was a problem was that you have people who are

735
00:42:48.711 --> 00:42:52.310
essentially entitled to full benefits at 50 years old.
Yeah.

736
00:42:52.311 --> 00:42:56.240
Justin was also saying that there was also jobs where it required you to use to

737
00:42:56.241 --> 00:42:59.660
people.
Those was union contract,
but they didn't really need to use two people.

738
00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.730
So you would have like two hour shifts,

739
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.790
like you would come in for two hours and do it and then you can go leave and do

740
00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:05.700
whatever the fuck you want.

741
00:43:05.701 --> 00:43:09.460
And another guy would come in for two hours and you did two shifts a day and you

742
00:43:09.461 --> 00:43:13.640
each to two shifts a day and that's what you got paid for a full job.

743
00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:18.260
And it's just because of the greed of these,
these auto workers,
the unions,

744
00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:21.340
the unions.
Yeah.
And then you know,
it's also the real,

745
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.470
another problem was they made a bunch of Shitty fucking cars and that's not the

746
00:43:24.471 --> 00:43:28.460
auto workers problem.
It's a design problem and the engineer's problems.

747
00:43:28.461 --> 00:43:32.150
But goddamn United States made some terrible cars in the eighties yeah,

748
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:35.240
I mean they're,
they fucked up everything.
They fucked up the Mustang.

749
00:43:35.241 --> 00:43:37.610
They fucked up the corvette.
They fucked up the Camaro.

750
00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:42.130
They fucked up all the greatest cars that the United States has ever dose.
Yes.

751
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.920
Fucked him all up.
Completely.
Dog Shit.

752
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:49.550
Late eighties and the early nine they were dog shit.

753
00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:52.430
They were the stupidest looking,
ugliest fucking cars.

754
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:54.890
It's like they were trying to tank it on purpose.

755
00:43:55.530 --> 00:44:00.530
You can go back in time and you look at a 1969 Mustang fastback.

756
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:05.090
Look at like a gt 500 from 1969.

757
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:09.650
Those cars were a masterpiece.
That's the lines on them.

758
00:44:09.651 --> 00:44:11.420
The appeal of them that just uh,

759
00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:14.480
just look at them just like artistically they had this,

760
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:19.040
this appeal to them and then they tried to make cars more gas friendly because

761
00:44:19.041 --> 00:44:23.000
the gas prices went up because they had the like the fake gas shortage where

762
00:44:23.001 --> 00:44:27.970
they fucked everybody and oh we ran it again.
Psych.
Um,

763
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:31.040
then they just,
from that point on they all just went to shit.

764
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.160
They couldn't have those big

765
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.470
<v 0>v eight s anymore cause they only got eight miles a gallon.</v>

766
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.540
So instead they started making these stupid six cylinder Mustang.

767
00:44:38.541 --> 00:44:42.040
So it just looked like dog shit.
And the big thing now is that what,

768
00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:43.900
what gave a big boost,
at least you know,

769
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:47.460
like to dodge was that they went to a throwback.

770
00:44:47.461 --> 00:44:51.630
It was like these look like the old designs like the Dodge Challenger

771
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:57.750
merit of the challenges wrap.
The challenger really looks like an old one,

772
00:44:57.751 --> 00:45:02.580
but the Camaro looks like a new car.
I mean it's,
it's like they didn't,
they,

773
00:45:02.581 --> 00:45:07.000
it's kind of a retro hot rod kind of a look to.
It does,
but it's still a new,

774
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.470
it looks bad ass.
They had a new,
uh,
they have a new uh,

775
00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:14.300
Trans-am oh really?
Yeah.
Camaro.

776
00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:19.260
Trans am and uh,
can you still get the Falcon or those z 28

777
00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:23.670
trans am was the Firebird.
Is he 28 and the z 28.

778
00:45:23.671 --> 00:45:28.460
The new Camaro is faster around a racetrack than a,
than a Porsche raise.

779
00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:33.030
We didn't.
When you in the car play in the video,
the sound of it.
Oh my God.

780
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:37.630
It's
not as good.
I can do it.
Do it.
Terrible.

781
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:43.300
I appreciate it.
Brian Couch.
I've got Brian Counter.

782
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:48.270
Whatever reason likes to hear me do animal animal noises.
I was so impressed.

783
00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:51.120
Her dog is impeccable.
The bear,

784
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:55.800
the bear has is layered noises.
Perfect.
And so is the lip quivering?

785
00:45:55.801 --> 00:45:58.520
Yeah.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
It's really good.

786
00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:02.460
I really don't know what's wrong.
I can only do a few in PR.
I'm not,

787
00:46:02.461 --> 00:46:05.580
I would never say I was an impressionist cause I can't do a lot of impressions.

788
00:46:05.581 --> 00:46:09.150
Like my voice range is not that good,
but if it falls in my range,
I can do it.

789
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:13.050
Alex Jones,
you do what?
I can do that and you can do a d as well.
I could do it.

790
00:46:13.051 --> 00:46:17.110
[inaudible] do you see those guys are my range three shouty loudy guys.

791
00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:22.350
Very good.
I can do some people but it's,
it has to like,
you know,

792
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:25.590
you know like you couldn't say,
Hey Justin Bieber.
Yeah.

793
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:31.590
Did you see that fucking video?
This is the z 28 that's the car.
Yeah.

794
00:46:31.591 --> 00:46:35.730
Jay Leno's car,
Phoenix,
his garage and Burbank.
They took this a,

795
00:46:35.731 --> 00:46:40.080
that's not the z 28 they took this z 28 and they took out everything.

796
00:46:40.081 --> 00:46:41.400
All the navigation.

797
00:46:41.401 --> 00:46:45.690
Radio only has one speaker to let you know that the door goes Ding,
ding,
Ding.

798
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:49.500
They took out all that shit to make it super light and put it in a 500

799
00:46:49.501 --> 00:46:53.310
horsepower naturally aspirated engine.
He's got denim on denim,
on Jay Leno.

800
00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:56.250
He always has done a on rocks it,
he's not growing up.

801
00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:59.460
He's a towards her last kid.
Listen to this thing.

802
00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:04.310
<v 5>Parts like Rambo,
carbon,
ceramics and so on.
It's going to be more,</v>

803
00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.170
<v 0>you hear that?
That makes the guys balls tangle.
Yeah.</v>

804
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:14.280
<v 5>Not on the public street.
I'm sure.
At least in California that thumbs up</v>

805
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:17.510
Malbec tanning rhetoric.

806
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:21.240
<v 0>That's cause it's you Jason that for the car.
That is a wicked car though.</v>

807
00:47:21.241 --> 00:47:24.000
As far as American cars go,
that car is wicked.

808
00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:30.010
But you think she can.
Let's just that costs.
It's not much as far

809
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.420
<v 2>as like the kind of performance,</v>

810
00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:34.630
I think it's probably going to be around 60 grand.
Let's find out.
News.

811
00:47:34.631 --> 00:47:39.520
Each one had the,
the bargains are the [inaudible] and the core event.

812
00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:43.120
They have a new corvette now.
It's fucking incredible.
Yes.

813
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:46.990
The fucking new corvette is crazy.
Oh,
it's amazing.

814
00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:52.000
And the price is pretty amazing what you get.
It's like 60,
68.

815
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:55.240
I think they had an inner agency.
51.

816
00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:56.730
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

817
00:47:56.730 --> 00:48:01.290
<v 2>Well they have to see 28 is a oh,
the sting rays.
The new,
um,
yeah,</v>

818
00:48:01.291 --> 00:48:03.700
the sting rays in new corvette price.

819
00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:09.240
The stingrays incredible.
Have you seen that?
Yeah.
Go to the,
uh,

820
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:12.870
see if you pull up Matt Farah.
That dude who was on the podcast,
a smoking gun.

821
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:21.160
There's that look like when I was a kid corvette.

822
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:24.620
I liked the brand and the car didn't look so cool.
Wow.
Look at that.

823
00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:29.260
Do you have to put a bra on it though?
No,
those are done.

824
00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:30.130
They don't do those anymore.

825
00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:34.570
Why did they do when people have clear blue now is a clear sheet that keeps the

826
00:48:34.571 --> 00:48:37.930
chips.
Oh,
still avoid paint chips.
Oh,
from rocks.

827
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:40.650
That's why people wrap their cars.
This thing,

828
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:47.460
just like you bought in the wheel.
Yeah,
buddy.

829
00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:52.140
<v 5>The first thing you're struck by how light and nimble this car is.
This,</v>

830
00:48:52.141 --> 00:48:55.380
look at the seats.
You know what?
Each generation in the corvette,

831
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:57.000
it seems to get a little bit lighter,

832
00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.280
a little bit smaller and a little more agile.

833
00:48:59.281 --> 00:49:01.740
And this one really feels like the best one yet.

834
00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:04.910
<v 2>It's a sick car.
I just loved it.</v>

835
00:49:04.911 --> 00:49:08.210
America's finally figured out how to make cars that don't suck a fat one.

836
00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:12.550
For the longest time they were dog shit.
I got a um,

837
00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:17.630
a Ford Mustang just because I knew that Mustang didn't take money from the

838
00:49:17.631 --> 00:49:20.840
government.
They didn't take a bail out.
So then I was thinking about getting,

839
00:49:20.841 --> 00:49:24.650
I wanted to get some sort of American hot rod,
so I got a,
um,
a gt 500.

840
00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:29.090
That's why I got it.
I got it because of the fact and because it's just,

841
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.280
it's pretty bad ass.
Yeah.
It's uh,
it's,

842
00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:35.000
they've figured out how to make fun cars again.
Yeah.
They figured out a Shelby.

843
00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:39.620
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Those things are fun.
That,
that rumble too.

844
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:44.150
It's very manly.
Yeah.
This is even more manly though,
I think because he is he 28.

845
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.890
I might have a purchase one of these motherfuckers.
I'm saying.

846
00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:53.270
That's what I'm saying.
I want to support the honestly like no bullshit.

847
00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.570
I really do want to support American car companies and Megan cars like this.

848
00:49:56.571 --> 00:50:00.680
That's great.
Are they making them in America though?
God,
I hope so.
Volkswagen.

849
00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:05.030
Then I'll them.
No other people's,
we have a lot of foreign.

850
00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:09.750
Volkswagen just went to now in Mexico.
That doesn't seem like German to me.
Don't,

851
00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:14.450
don't we have foreign though?
Plants here for like this?
A Porsche.

852
00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.450
Some Porsches in Alabama.
That's a good question.

853
00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:20.970
I don't know BMW in South Carolina.
No,
Honda does.
I don't know.

854
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:23.270
But I would imagine that other companies who as well,

855
00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:27.170
I think Porsche is in Alabama.
I wonder if that's because it's easier.

856
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.130
Build the cars over

857
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.680
<v 0>here instead of shipping them,
you know,
like whatever.</v>

858
00:50:30.681 --> 00:50:31.720
It would cost you to ship them.

859
00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:34.760
You could probably make them over here with the same engineering.

860
00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:39.380
It's all robots.
Yeah.
There's a lot of it is right.
It's all automated.
That's,

861
00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:43.730
that also killed a lot of jobs because everything,
a lot of it is automated,

862
00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.740
but the precision that you can get an automation,
it's,
you know,

863
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:51.200
pretty God damn amazing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We can print out a car pretty soon.
I bet.

864
00:50:51.201 --> 00:50:54.350
You're right.
Dude.
This is no bullshit,
man.
It's going to come.

865
00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:57.620
I think there's gonna come a time where going to the store and buying things,

866
00:50:57.621 --> 00:51:00.350
people are just going to laugh at you.
Oh my God,

867
00:51:00.351 --> 00:51:02.810
you guys just to buy shit that's so stupid.

868
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:05.420
They're going to be able to just put like,

869
00:51:05.421 --> 00:51:08.540
you're going to have a printer at home and you're gonna keep ingredients in it.

870
00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:12.710
Carbons,
Silica,
this,
that,
the other different various metals.

871
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.830
And then you're gonna say,
you know,
build me a fucking TV bitch.

872
00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:18.320
And you enter in your credits for the,
uh,

873
00:51:18.321 --> 00:51:22.130
the design for the TV and you get a on your iTunes account,

874
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:24.740
it charges you for the design for the TV.
That's what you pay,

875
00:51:24.741 --> 00:51:29.690
like a design license fee.
And then you have to pay for the,
um,
the materials.

876
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:33.560
And then I think everything will be like way cheaper except the machine,

877
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:36.560
the machine's going to be a motherfucker,
but it'd be just like cell phones.

878
00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.320
When cell phones first came out and no one had them,
you know,

879
00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:43.220
they were super rare.
And now you go to any place in the world,

880
00:51:43.221 --> 00:51:44.060
people have cell phones.

881
00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:48.800
I was in Brazil and it was in 2003 everyone has a cell phone.

882
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:51.510
Rarely people have cell phones,

883
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.650
they're everywhere and they used to be like prohibitively expensive for poor

884
00:51:54.651 --> 00:51:56.660
people because they have the backpack thing where you have to put the

885
00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:03.740
little android phones and iPhones and shit.
Car phones.
Oh yeah.

886
00:52:03.741 --> 00:52:05.380
I actually liked that one.

887
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:10.040
I had one installed in my car and 89 eight nine I would like to have one of

888
00:52:10.041 --> 00:52:14.030
those again,
just the nice,
yeah,
it's nice.

889
00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:17.210
Right in the center console.
It was a cool thing to have.

890
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:20.660
Like you would be on the phone.
Hello?
I'm driving right now.

891
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:25.080
Fucking nobody believed it.
Nobody.

892
00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:30.080
But you would have roaming charges everywhere.
Oh my God.

893
00:52:30.081 --> 00:52:32.300
You were only allowed to use it when I had it.

894
00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:36.560
You were only allowed to use it in Boston itself and when I would go outside of

895
00:52:36.561 --> 00:52:37.394
Boston,

896
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:41.960
I would enter into a roaming area and the roaming areas would be ridiculous.

897
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:43.580
It would be like,
you know,

898
00:52:43.581 --> 00:52:46.820
a dollar a minute and a dollar 95 a minute or something like that and it was

899
00:52:46.821 --> 00:52:48.500
just a few hours from your house.

900
00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:54.120
Suddenly today you know it got real competitive and today you could go anywhere

901
00:52:54.321 --> 00:52:55.340
and you found works everywhere.

902
00:52:55.341 --> 00:52:57.890
If you go international and you gotta pay rates that are different because they

903
00:52:57.891 --> 00:52:58.820
have to use their service,

904
00:52:58.821 --> 00:53:01.900
but the United States is essentially where the fuck you go.
You are right.

905
00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:02.870
So crazy.

906
00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:06.770
But I was in western Massachusetts is two hours from my house and it was
roaming.

907
00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.820
Oh you were,
you were,
you had like a really little area,

908
00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:15.530
like even in Massachusetts you have roving.
Yeah.
What was that bill like?

909
00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.500
It was stupid.
It was unbelievable and I had no money back then.
I was like,

910
00:53:18.501 --> 00:53:21.180
Oh God,
yeah,
I didn't,

911
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.840
I didn't have a cell phone until I graduated from college and entered the

912
00:53:23.841 --> 00:53:26.070
workforce.
Like,
just thinking about being

913
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.770
<v 3>16 years old,
waving goodbye to my dad,</v>

914
00:53:28.771 --> 00:53:33.771
getting into my 87 Chevy Nova and just taking off for the night and my dad not

915
00:53:33.871 --> 00:53:37.590
knowing where I was when I was,
I didn't have a page or nothing.
And I would just,

916
00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:41.730
you know,
come back to in the morning.
Yeah.
I mean,
I was shooting porn.

917
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:46.620
I was doing h
striven.
Mack,
can you believe that?

918
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:50.790
<v 0>That's the thing is you didn't even know this guy's got one</v>

919
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:06.140
massive
bill gates.

920
00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.990
That's a cock blocked video.
Cock bunker.

921
00:54:15.991 --> 00:54:19.620
Dad's a hater smarter than him.
He's got his big stupid phone.

922
00:54:19.621 --> 00:54:24.300
The kids on a little laptop you want,
it's like 1918.
When,
when,

923
00:54:24.301 --> 00:54:27.060
when did they invent and laptops?
Oh my God.

924
00:54:27.061 --> 00:54:29.890
The kid had a laptop in his lap to the typewriter.

925
00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:34.320
I think it was when his word processors.
Remember those labs?
Hewlett Packard.

926
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.350
It was trying to let you know,
geniuses are ahead of the curb.

927
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:39.420
I've had a cell phone forever.
Like I said,

928
00:54:39.421 --> 00:54:43.420
I got my first one in 89 Haden and then I,
um,

929
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.510
I couldn't afford it after awhile.

930
00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:49.800
So I think I probably got my next one in 93,

931
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.450
92 or 93.
I've got some big stupid Motorola brick.

932
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:58.950
The brick called it star tech click and I had an extended battery.

933
00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:02.930
The Nino Brown needed that extended battery.
No,
it wasn't that big.
No,

934
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.380
I didn't have that one.
I know what you're talking about.

935
00:55:04.381 --> 00:55:06.940
I had a girlfriend that had one of those breast.
Yeah,
it's brick.

936
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:11.010
My brick was a flip.
Oh Wow.
My first one flipped.

937
00:55:11.011 --> 00:55:15.540
I never got the full brick.
I still see,
I think the,
uh,
the Motorola Razor,

938
00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:18.480
which came obviously much later.
Yeah,
it was the perfect fucking cell phone.

939
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:23.100
It really is.
Yeah.
It's awesome.
But Hammer,
it's not good enough.
It's not good.

940
00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.830
It's just can't fuck with today.
Right.
It doesn't have a browser.

941
00:55:25.831 --> 00:55:28.110
It's like we don't want just a phone anymore.

942
00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:31.890
We want a phone that does everything.
I can do my banking on this phone.

943
00:55:31.891 --> 00:55:36.840
How crazy is that?
Don't just banking,
I believe,
to me.
Dot.
To anything I want.

944
00:55:36.841 --> 00:55:41.130
I sat my Dvr when I'm on in another country,
you know,
I can go,
oh fuck,

945
00:55:41.131 --> 00:55:44.160
I forgot to tape the fights.
Did you do it?
Does it just records it for me?

946
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:48.350
That's incredibly,
that's madness.
Uber.
Yeah.
Uber is incredible.
Amazing.
Yeah.

947
00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.850
Well just sending videos and pictures to people and Shit.

948
00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:56.130
How fucking long have you used it?
I use it all the time.

949
00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:58.030
Really favorite things ever.
It's great.

950
00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:01.830
Uber or neighbor was just telling us about that.
Yeah,
we're not on that yet.

951
00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:05.910
Duncan called me too.
And have you done this Uber?
I'm in a car right now.

952
00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:08.883
<v 3>That's cool.</v>

953
00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:12.400
I still talking the other day and he ubered and he doesn't even do the Uberx he

954
00:56:12.401 --> 00:56:12.640
pulled,

955
00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:16.180
he gets like the SUV one that comes up and he just like walked in there like a

956
00:56:16.181 --> 00:56:18.630
pimp.
I like,
it was just,
it's just crazy.

957
00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:22.780
Like in three minutes you can have like a pretty much a black limo pick you up

958
00:56:22.781 --> 00:56:23.614
for

959
00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:29.120
<v 0>and the tip is built in,
you know,
I tip them extra,
but the tip is built into the,</v>

960
00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:32.680
the thing,
you know,
it's nice.
It's so easy.
You just get in,
get out,
say thanks,

961
00:56:32.681 --> 00:56:34.660
bye.
That's great.
And you've got a limo ride,

962
00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:39.600
don't you review them or something like that.
Yeah,
that's awesome.

963
00:56:39.601 --> 00:56:40.840
Nice car.
Oh yeah.

964
00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:44.520
Yeah it was or not there was an that we use in Manhattan a couple of times cause

965
00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:48.410
SUV.
So we got,
there were nice drivers.
Everybody was cool,
respectable folks.

966
00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:49.720
Last where I went to,

967
00:56:49.721 --> 00:56:53.170
the guy said that he gets a lot of people that that are just ballers like hey I

968
00:56:53.171 --> 00:56:54.190
want to go to Vegas.

969
00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:58.600
And so they'll Uber from La to Vegas but then he has to drive fucking back,

970
00:56:58.601 --> 00:56:59.530
you know,
by himself.

971
00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:03.670
You know somebody the other day went to Salt Lake City cause they didn't have a

972
00:57:03.671 --> 00:57:05.600
car and they wanted to go home.
So he,

973
00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:09.330
he said it was like two $2,500 Uber to swing

974
00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:14.020
plane ticket though.
If you're going FirstClass that might be better.

975
00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.410
Definitely better.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I guess before,

976
00:57:17.411 --> 00:57:21.190
I've done Vegas in a limo before,
but it's a,
it's a long drive.

977
00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:25.720
It is to drive.
I've driven it to four hours.

978
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:30.750
It's a long drive to do in one day and then go do something real spent desert.

979
00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:33.560
It's also if you get stuck in traffic there,

980
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:39.670
that's the erode that was designed back when people were driving model t's,

981
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:40.850
you know,

982
00:57:40.850 --> 00:57:45.850
stupid two lane shitbag road and it's just going through these desolate areas

983
00:57:47.741 --> 00:57:52.741
and broken down and nothing but break lights for hours and the worst.

984
00:57:54.071 --> 00:57:58.660
The weirdest thing is like there is that the first sign of like the casinos that

985
00:57:58.661 --> 00:58:01.100
come up,
I'm talking about,
they're like the crummier ones.

986
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.200
There's cooler.
It's a broken roller coaster.

987
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:11.830
Probably a great documentary in that if we wanted to make it,

988
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:16.460
we all want it to just go to that place,
that one spot and

989
00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:22.770
do a show there and bring,
you know,
all roller coasters and shit.
They're

990
00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:27.400
fucking roller coaster.
But I imagine that that would actually be you look,

991
00:58:27.401 --> 00:58:32.401
you meet and Diaz doing a show in a casino there in the middle of nowhere.

992
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:38.580
That might actually be fun.
We could bring people in there.

993
00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:42.210
Nobody there would be explode.
Expect what's going on.
Yeah,

994
00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:46.870
it would be a fun hangout.
That'd be a fun hangout.
Just call it,

995
00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:49.750
you know,
disaster in the desert or something like that.

996
00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:53.410
Every one of those places has the thing like these slots pay.

997
00:58:53.590 --> 00:58:58.190
That's what it says.
We got the loose,
we've got real loose slots.

998
00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:01.930
Are you going to go into and hope has been doing a tour of really shitty spots

999
00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:04.870
and such a good ideal burger.
Wanted to do that too.

1000
00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:08.800
He wanted to do one with me and him go to like the worst places ever.
I'm like,

1001
00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:13.290
boy,
I don't know.
It sounds like it sounds novel but it doesn't.

1002
00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:15.460
He wouldn't be better to go to like Houston.

1003
00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:18.910
Whether it be better to go to like Chicago,

1004
00:59:18.911 --> 00:59:22.730
like you guys got to get out of there.
Yeah,
I'm not coming to you.

1005
00:59:22.731 --> 00:59:27.650
It's only helping you.
If I come to you
and mommy encouraging this bad behavior,

1006
00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:32.120
encouraging you to stay there,
go move to a cool place.

1007
00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:36.230
There's some places I get psyched to be back like Chicago,
you know,

1008
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:40.550
I was talking to somebody about Chicago bur we were talking about Chicago might

1009
00:59:40.551 --> 00:59:43.640
be like with the most underrated place in the country,
you know,

1010
00:59:43.641 --> 00:59:46.850
like as far as like doing stand up there.
Chicago's great.

1011
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:50.000
It's one of the greatest places of all time to do stand up in Schomburg.

1012
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.190
The Schomburg.
It's really the Schomburg.
It's more of a suburban thing.

1013
00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:56.240
I do the theater,
the Chicago theater and it's in,
you know,

1014
00:59:56.241 --> 00:59:59.570
in the city and it's different.
They're,
they're on the ball.

1015
00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:04.310
There are some smart fucking people.
I enjoy the Midwest for standup.
I Love Ohio.

1016
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.473
I Love Ohio.

1017
01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:09.350
Tastic like for some reason the Midwest really gets it and they're down.
Yeah.

1018
01:00:09.351 --> 01:00:12.830
I did one of my best specials talking monkey's in space.
I did that in a while.

1019
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.850
Does that in Columbus at the southern theater where,
um,

1020
01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:20.540
may west worked get out.
Yeah.
And the WC fields and maybe,
yeah.

1021
01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:25.120
<v 1>Well h that's awesome.
Yeah.
That's one of the stars in the background.
Yeah.
Yeah,</v>

1022
01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:26.720
yeah.
That looks really,
really good.

1023
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:28.640
<v 0>Yeah.
Those.
Those people are like,</v>

1024
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:32.850
I always feel like people in like Columbus and people won't like Chicago and

1025
01:00:32.851 --> 01:00:35.930
people and Mike Milwaukee,
they're like smart people,

1026
01:00:35.931 --> 01:00:39.680
but also they have that Midwest like down to earth thing going on.

1027
01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.660
There might be in a city,

1028
01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.590
but there's like a lot of people that are like real good people that are like,

1029
01:00:45.591 --> 01:00:49.750
you know this like,
you know when they call that area the heartland,

1030
01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.190
like the salt of the earth.
There's a lot of morons live out there.

1031
01:00:52.191 --> 01:00:53.510
Don't make no mistake about it.
All right?

1032
01:00:53.511 --> 01:00:58.511
This is a lot like a lot of the really earth farmy places in this country are

1033
01:00:58.671 --> 01:01:00.980
filled with retards.
All right?
We know that,

1034
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:04.760
but they're also filled with a lot of cool fucking paid for sure.
You know,

1035
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:09.570
and just like everywhere you go,
you're not going to get 100% gyms.
Right?

1036
01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:14.150
You're just not,
you're just getting,
there's always a trade off.
Fuck.
Yeah.

1037
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:17.990
And those are the ones that are Turd.
They throw off your,
your perceptions.

1038
01:01:18.310 --> 01:01:21.950
Like I've had people say,
you know,
Oh man,
and went to La man to this party.

1039
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:23.900
Everybody was so fucking full of themselves,

1040
01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:26.900
real full of shit and that place sucks.
Okay.

1041
01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:31.610
I believe you 100% but that how there's 20 million people here.

1042
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:34.640
You can't find one,
one party,
one night,

1043
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:38.670
one terrible clunk of humans and you know,

1044
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:40.700
you just got mixed up in the wrong tribe,
son.

1045
01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:43.130
<v 1>The other one been hanging out with us at the end.
Prob.
Yeah,</v>

1046
01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:48.020
it is tribes finding your tribe and wherever you are and wherever you are,

1047
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:52.720
people also talk shit about La Times.
They'll be like,
the fuck you're from La.

1048
01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:56.710
This place sucks.
And I'm like,
what'd you,
I went out there for like,
you know,

1049
01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.270
whatever,
three or four days like,
where'd you stay there?

1050
01:01:59.271 --> 01:02:02.270
Like Hollywood and Highland.
And I'm like,
did you go anywhere?
They're like,
no,

1051
01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:05.090
just right there.
I'm like,
so you hate fucking Hollywood boulevard man?

1052
01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.710
Like what are you talking about?

1053
01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.430
That's not indicative of the entire city.

1054
01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:14.390
I've been here since [inaudible] 94 and I don't go there.
Come on.
It's horrible.

1055
01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.280
It's a bad place.
It's like saying,
I was,

1056
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:20.130
one of my friends told me he hated New York and he,
uh,

1057
01:02:20.830 --> 01:02:23.760
<v 0>he,
he was like,
it's the worst fucking city of everyone.
Like,
really?</v>

1058
01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.610
Where'd you stay?
Wait,
where'd you go?
He's like,
I was in Spanish Harlem.

1059
01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:29.340
And I was like,
but like,
where'd you go?
He was like,
no,
I just stayed there.
Like,

1060
01:02:29.341 --> 01:02:32.910
I stayed in Spanish Harlem.
I was like,
that's all you saw?
And he was like,
yeah.

1061
01:02:32.911 --> 01:02:37.560
I go,
well,
I mean,
that's not,
you can't take in the city just in Spanish Harlem.

1062
01:02:37.561 --> 01:02:41.290
You can't take it in that city in a year.
No.
You know,
you will,

1063
01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:43.590
you're going to do is get a sense of like,
Whoa,

1064
01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:47.370
there's a lot of motherfuckers here spend two weeks in New York just going from

1065
01:02:47.371 --> 01:02:48.200
one place.
You know,

1066
01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.280
that just trying to check off a list of the interesting places from the museums

1067
01:02:52.281 --> 01:02:55.740
to the restaurants to going,
going on Broadway,

1068
01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.920
like New York is so strange that Broadway works there.

1069
01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.033
Okay.
Right.

1070
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:07.100
Here's a fucking really good reason why those stupid musicals and plays are

1071
01:03:07.590 --> 01:03:10.380
everywhere.
They're so dumb.

1072
01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:14.190
They're a murderous assaulted,
your attention span.

1073
01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:19.520
But New York is so big and so awesome that it can actually support a whole

1074
01:03:19.711 --> 01:03:23.880
community of people that pretend to like that stuff and make them millionaires.

1075
01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:27.270
Maybe they do like it.
Maybe I'm just an asshole.
Most likely.

1076
01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:30.180
I'm just an asshole that Andrew Lloyd Webber Shit.

1077
01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:35.570
So soul crushing.
That's so fucking spirit question.
Okay.

1078
01:03:35.590 --> 01:03:39.490
It'll literally be like,
I'm lifting the bottom,
she's lifting the bottle,

1079
01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:42.370
we're walking down the street.
There's this,
exactly.

1080
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:48.470
I went to see Brian Callahan had a teacher who was a,

1081
01:03:48.790 --> 01:03:53.180
a a theater teacher.
And Brian always gets sucked into,

1082
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:56.790
cause he's such a nice guy.
He just gets sucked into going to these things.

1083
01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:59.430
They drag them to these things.
There were there,
there was like,

1084
01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:03.930
I'm doing a performance.
I would love it if he's like,
I gotta go,
I gotta go.

1085
01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:08.550
So this was,
the guy was going to sing show tunes.
And so Brian calls me up,

1086
01:04:08.551 --> 01:04:11.070
he goes,
listen to me,
listen to me.
She must come with me.

1087
01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:16.030
I'm about to see my inner teacher sing show tunes.

1088
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:19.650
It will be most excellent.
And by the way,
he's going to be very sincere.

1089
01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:24.860
So we went and watched this guy saying like these sincere shows like shit and I

1090
01:04:24.901 --> 01:04:28.860
hope you have a dream and you really want to drink.

1091
01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:32.760
Like that kind of stuff that when you're talking about,
they're almost like,

1092
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:37.860
like doing dialogue but singing.
Yeah.

1093
01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:41.430
So it doesn't even make sense.
Why are we singing the song?

1094
01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:45.660
It's you guys terrified.
That's why they're saying we're going to get some angry.

1095
01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:50.580
He was really good.
I enjoyed it.
Enjoyed it.
I enjoyed it so high.

1096
01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:54.300
I was so high.
My feet were barely touching the ground.

1097
01:04:54.301 --> 01:04:57.450
Cause all I could think about was the amount of ad space that's in an atom.

1098
01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.030
An atom is almost entirely made out of space.

1099
01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:03.420
And so I was thinking of like while this guy was singing,
I was like,

1100
01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.910
why do I even feel the ground?
This is all bullshit.

1101
01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:10.470
And that's what you were enjoying.
No real.
This is all space.

1102
01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:11.900
Why does it feel hard under my feet?

1103
01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:14.760
That's what I was thinking about why this is the guy was going was that here you

1104
01:05:14.761 --> 01:05:18.250
have a tree.
Yeah.
It was on Hollywood.
It was on Hollywood

1105
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:22.730
<v 2>boulevard someplace.
I believe it was a nice place,
dude.
I think that,
uh,</v>

1106
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:25.120
that heartland area though,
not just Chicago,

1107
01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:28.860
that whole area is underrated for stand up.
Oh yeah.
Across the warming.

1108
01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:33.340
You know what's Kinda fucked up is that not a lot of standups came out of

1109
01:05:33.341 --> 01:05:37.820
Chicago.
Like if you look at like Houston,
some of the all timers,

1110
01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:40.320
Bill Hicks,
Sam Kennison,
you know,

1111
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:45.040
there's a lot of great fucking comics came out of Houston to my two all time

1112
01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:49.210
favorites right there.
And so,
you know,
you compare Chicago to Houston.

1113
01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:52.570
Chicago was way bigger.
Like,
why doesn't Chicago have a gang of comics?

1114
01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:56.050
Look at New York,
the list of Comedians that have come out of,
it's endless.

1115
01:05:56.051 --> 01:05:59.430
It's pointless to even start,
look at la pointless.
Steven Starr.

1116
01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:04.450
Look at Boston smaller than Chicago by a good margin in the amount of great

1117
01:06:04.451 --> 01:06:08.890
comics that came out of Boston.
Staggering Chicago.
You got Larry Reed,

1118
01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:13.850
you know your uncle air.
Remember that guy?
No,
no.
He's a funny guy.
Funny Guy,

1119
01:06:13.851 --> 01:06:17.850
a Chicago guy.
He was on one of those Rodney Dangerfield,
HBO specialists,

1120
01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:22.420
but a lot of Improv guys sketch him.
Prep guys.
That's true.
That's true.

1121
01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.350
Maybe that's what it is.
Second city in Chicago,
they're not analytical.

1122
01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.770
That doesn't make any sense.
The standup is better.
They know it.
You know it.

1123
01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:33.580
I know it.
Why wouldn't they do that and stuff?
It's the funniest shit.
If you,

1124
01:06:33.581 --> 01:06:37.150
if you want to go see,
if you want to see something really funny,
you go,

1125
01:06:37.151 --> 01:06:41.290
you go see a gross.
Then my opinion and the other area,

1126
01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:45.040
I always have good time going there,
but I don't know.
I don't know that many.

1127
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:48.960
Well,
actually Minneapolis Swartz and came out of Minneapolis.
Yeah.

1128
01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:51.430
He's a super fucking funny guy.
He's hilarious.

1129
01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:55.930
I don't know that many other people follow me.
Why do I want to say that?

1130
01:06:55.931 --> 01:06:59.920
Mitch Hedberg came at him and he is from Minnesota too.
Yes.
Yeah.
Good one.
Yeah.

1131
01:06:59.921 --> 01:07:03.490
He actually recorded one of his CD's at acme,
right,
didn't he?

1132
01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:07.000
I don't know if he recorded one that I recorded one there and I'm doing a

1133
01:07:07.001 --> 01:07:10.930
special there.
I love mini a special in Minneapolis.
I love Minnesota period.

1134
01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:14.050
It's awesome.
It's an awesome up there.
Yeah.
Cold as fuck.

1135
01:07:14.051 --> 01:07:17.410
But I'm going right before it gets going.
November 9th,

1136
01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:22.630
which is basically once you get into January,
February,
it's fucking

1137
01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.420
free tickets.
I had to go to that special,
by the way.
Yes you can.
Tom.

1138
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:32.200
Cigarette outcome suite.
Google mooglie come to my special.

1139
01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:36.010
I can't,
but I will tell people to go.
What Day is it?
November 9th.

1140
01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:42.130
November 9th.
Yeah.
Yeah,
son.
Yeah.
I love,

1141
01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:46.330
I mean I picked it because I actually literally have never had a bad time doing

1142
01:07:46.331 --> 01:07:50.770
stand up in Minneapolis.
Yeah.
It's that good.
Yeah.
So that's uh,
I'm in,

1143
01:07:50.771 --> 01:07:54.610
um,
I'm in Edmonton that night.
I took her in a colder place.

1144
01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:58.900
You're in a cold.
Yeah.
With the River Creek.
Edmundson's fun,
fun.

1145
01:07:58.901 --> 01:08:03.730
Do you ever go up there?
I've never been there.
I've done Winnipeg,
Calgary,

1146
01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:08.620
Toronto,
Vancouver,
Montreal.
Toronto was amazing.
Yeah,

1147
01:08:08.621 --> 01:08:13.390
we did a two nights in Toronto.
We did,
we did the Sony Center.
Right.

1148
01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.340
Then one was,
we did the Sony Center night and then the next night

1149
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:20.180
<v 0>we did second city.
It was fucking incredible.
Wonderful.</v>

1150
01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:22.550
Uncredible and then people couldn't have been nicer.

1151
01:08:22.551 --> 01:08:24.590
I like the people that you run into there.
Oh my God.

1152
01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:29.690
It's like a weird Utopian city.
Yeah.
They're super nice up there.

1153
01:08:30.610 --> 01:08:34.550
Canada is just nicer.
It's w I wonder,
I've wondered many,

1154
01:08:34.551 --> 01:08:38.840
many times to try to figure out what it is.
Like why,
why are they nicer?

1155
01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:42.480
<v 3>Um,
well,
I have a friend from Canada,
my friend Shane,</v>

1156
01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:47.540
and he claims it's because when you have the kind of have more of a support

1157
01:08:47.671 --> 01:08:50.250
system.
Yeah.
Like the government does take more of your money,

1158
01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:52.950
but maybe it's because they take care of your health.

1159
01:08:52.951 --> 01:08:54.720
They take care of you a bit more.
And he's like,

1160
01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:58.530
we don't really have a need to be as competitive.
No guns.

1161
01:08:58.590 --> 01:09:01.730
Like I also feel like 20 guns.
Yeah.

1162
01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:04.530
But I remember watching the news in Toronto and um,

1163
01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:08.760
and it wasn't like that wasn't a big deal.
It was just so matter of fact,

1164
01:09:08.761 --> 01:09:11.850
like there was not a lot of sensationalism added to it the way we do.

1165
01:09:11.851 --> 01:09:14.940
It wasn't like be afraid,
be afraid,
everything's terabyte.
It was like,
well,

1166
01:09:14.941 --> 01:09:17.340
today what happened is,
you know,
blah blah,
blah,
blah blah.

1167
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:20.210
<v 0>You know what?
Also they don't have a guilty conscience as a country.</v>

1168
01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:23.630
Then I out there raping the world.
Yeah.
Maybe they're upset.

1169
01:09:23.690 --> 01:09:26.480
They're a part of some of the adventures that we go on right there.

1170
01:09:26.481 --> 01:09:29.630
They're like the dude that lives in the town that gets dragged along to now like

1171
01:09:29.631 --> 01:09:33.500
the crazy ass hole that organizes the,
the hit on the other village.
That's right.

1172
01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.130
You know.
Yeah.
They're just,
um,
I dunno.

1173
01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:41.090
I think it is less has that less.
You got to,
we're number one.

1174
01:09:41.091 --> 01:09:44.690
You've got to fucking,
yeah.
We loved the whole mantra.

1175
01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.240
If you stopped and thought about all the fucked up shit,

1176
01:09:47.241 --> 01:09:51.830
the United States does all the different countries and like how many people must

1177
01:09:51.831 --> 01:09:55.250
be like upset at the idea of the United States as a whole,

1178
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:59.300
not its real citizens like you or I who really don't have any part in any of

1179
01:09:59.301 --> 01:10:01.880
this stuff.
But somehow they get lumped in on the same team

1180
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:06.110
<v 3>and we benefit from our,
um,
empire.
Yeah,
that's a problem.</v>

1181
01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:10.460
But we are on this team and we benefit from this expansion from this conquering

1182
01:10:10.461 --> 01:10:10.940
of other,
yeah.

1183
01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.930
<v 0>That's how they keep us invested in it.
Sure.</v>

1184
01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.380
And that's when you hear like an Ann Coulter,
it's like,
Yay.

1185
01:10:15.381 --> 01:10:17.660
So we gotta go to fucking war for oil.
You know,

1186
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:20.720
people get real squirrely when it comes to that stuff.
And I see their point,

1187
01:10:21.170 --> 01:10:24.680
I see their point.
If,
you know,
if I looked at the world the way they do,

1188
01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.950
and I think a lot of people look at the world like there's these people and

1189
01:10:27.951 --> 01:10:31.360
these other parts of the world and these people are evil and these people,
uh,

1190
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:35.000
you know,
they hate your,
for your freedom.
They hate the hate.
What you stand for,

1191
01:10:35.001 --> 01:10:39.320
you,
their religion is based on hating you and wanting you dead.

1192
01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:44.170
I get that.
And all that oil too.
This is a little bit of that though.
So it,

1193
01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:48.260
that's convenient that those same dummies are the ones who have the oil.
Yeah.

1194
01:10:48.261 --> 01:10:52.490
It's dangerous dummies oils.
So we've got like a hood,
a winky dink.
Huh?

1195
01:10:53.710 --> 01:10:56.480
It's,
isn't it funny?
And they're always like,
it's,

1196
01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:00.770
their religion is so unreasonable.
You're not even allowed to draw their guy.

1197
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:04.460
If you draw their guy,
they'll fucking kill you.
I wouldn't even say that.

1198
01:11:04.461 --> 01:11:07.210
You're not allowed to draw the guy that might get you killed.

1199
01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:12.560
So it's like it's all set up so that it's perfectly reasonable for us to go over

1200
01:11:12.891 --> 01:11:15.810
there and fuck them up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's almost like,

1201
01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:21.640
like if you were wanting to play some longterm geopolitical chess longterm,

1202
01:11:22.650 --> 01:11:26.040
geopolitical chess means you got to ensure that you're going to have some

1203
01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:28.410
enemies to defeat in the future.
You can't keep,

1204
01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:32.970
like you can't destroy people and then build up a new empire from scratch.

1205
01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:35.640
You got to keep some and enemies active.

1206
01:11:35.641 --> 01:11:38.970
You've got to keep them healthy because if you don't have any conflict,

1207
01:11:38.971 --> 01:11:42.960
you don't.
You're not in business anymore.
So you empower these countries.

1208
01:11:42.961 --> 01:11:45.060
So it's like when the United States,

1209
01:11:45.061 --> 01:11:49.590
and this sounds like total hippie info wars nonsense,

1210
01:11:49.591 --> 01:11:52.500
but it's a fact.
It's been going on forever.

1211
01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:55.620
The United States armed Iraq and it was a bill Hicks joke.

1212
01:11:55.621 --> 01:11:59.200
We know they're heavily armed.
How do we know?
We check the receipt?
No,

1213
01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:04.010
I mean they,
yeah,
they armed Iraq,
they armed Iran.
They,

1214
01:12:04.011 --> 01:12:05.270
they've armed the,

1215
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:09.570
the whole member thing with President Reagan where he got in trouble because

1216
01:12:09.571 --> 01:12:11.550
he's sold arms to Iran and then he was,

1217
01:12:11.551 --> 01:12:14.780
he had to testify and he said he couldn't remember.
Yeah,

1218
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:18.630
I mean they have been doing it this way.

1219
01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.780
We provide a lot of arms to a lot of countries there.
Trust masters,

1220
01:12:21.781 --> 01:12:23.160
these are warm masters of war,

1221
01:12:23.161 --> 01:12:27.420
masters play chess and chess is a longterm game and you don't want to,

1222
01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:31.410
if you want to keep a fight going and you want to keep getting money,

1223
01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:34.530
you keep extracting money from the society that supports this.

1224
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:37.530
You don't ever like crush your enemies.

1225
01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.060
That's why they pulled out of Iraq in the first place.
The First Desert Storm,

1226
01:12:42.061 --> 01:12:44.790
when we first went in there,
when we first went in there,

1227
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:48.090
they decided not to take over Iraq.
They just,
they got in,

1228
01:12:48.091 --> 01:12:51.000
they crushed the enemy like with almost no resistance.

1229
01:12:51.001 --> 01:12:56.001
The only casualties where because of a Scud missile hit barracks and killed like

1230
01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:59.370
80 people.
But that was the only people that died.
Like other than that,

1231
01:12:59.371 --> 01:13:01.960
it was like a few people died.
A few people,

1232
01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:05.280
a lot of people got sick after the fact when they found out that they were using

1233
01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:09.690
depleted uranium and people got like some serious radiation sicknesses and

1234
01:13:09.691 --> 01:13:13.890
things.
But when they got to Baghdad,
they decided not to take it over.
Like,
yeah,

1235
01:13:13.891 --> 01:13:15.000
we'll just get out of here and leave it.

1236
01:13:15.001 --> 01:13:17.850
So they left Saddam Hussein to run the country after they crushed him.

1237
01:13:18.330 --> 01:13:21.990
And he basically ran it the same way you always ran.
It was crazy sons.

1238
01:13:21.991 --> 01:13:25.440
They fed people to dogs.
They were,
you know,
they were savages.

1239
01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:27.990
Saveable savages.
But we,

1240
01:13:27.991 --> 01:13:30.990
I believe that in the longterm chess game,

1241
01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:34.710
it's important to have a boogie man because if we wanted to go in and take Iraq,

1242
01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:40.100
like we can't really justify going to war unless something happens.

1243
01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:45.210
And the only way something happens is if other people have some kind of power,

1244
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:48.390
you know,
so they always are going to back off a little.

1245
01:13:48.391 --> 01:13:52.740
They're always going to let there be just enough enemies out there.

1246
01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:54.840
And now that it's not even like country based.

1247
01:13:54.841 --> 01:13:59.430
It's like terrorism like back in the Nazi days and the World War II days,

1248
01:13:59.431 --> 01:14:01.780
they fucked up.
They had to call them Nazis.
They call Nadine.

1249
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:05.550
If we beat the Nazis now what those fucking Russians,

1250
01:14:05.551 --> 01:14:06.840
I don't like the way they're looking at us.

1251
01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:12.040
Yes they ran out of enemies but with terrorism you never run out of enemies.

1252
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:13.180
<v 2>It's really brilliant.</v>

1253
01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.660
You need that for the sale to know how to do the sale to the public to be like,

1254
01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:20.280
you know what we got to do is cause here's the terrorists and they everywhere

1255
01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.560
you go and do something else and they come with a bunch of different names.

1256
01:14:23.561 --> 01:14:27.370
That confusing is fucked there.
Al Qaeda or the Taliban or wear a uniform,

1257
01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:30.460
which is the difference.
Is that all kind of part of the Taliban?

1258
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:33.330
They start out with the Taliban and Judy break off until,
I'm not sure.

1259
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:35.000
<v 3>Molly's faction and I'll tell you,</v>

1260
01:14:35.010 --> 01:14:39.590
y'all have no idea how many bases we do have in the Middle East.
I mean,

1261
01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:42.250
when I did several hundred in the,
in the,
in,

1262
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:45.290
in Dick rather a hundred more than a hundred different countries.

1263
01:14:46.150 --> 01:14:50.180
We're still in Kuwait,
uh,
were in Saudi Arabia and the government,

1264
01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:55.190
the government,
they gave me a duplicate passport.

1265
01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:56.510
I had two passports,

1266
01:14:56.511 --> 01:14:59.570
one of which I had to surrender after I went in and out of Saudi.

1267
01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.420
It was like a d quite passport to go into Saudi Arabia to perform and then come

1268
01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:07.280
immediately.
I mean,
it was,
it,
was it illegal what you're doing?
I don't know.

1269
01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:11.110
But your criminal on my show,
no,

1270
01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:15.740
but I'm trying to drive an American car to pay taxes go down.
But it was a trip.

1271
01:15:15.741 --> 01:15:17.390
I mean,
we're not supposed to be there.
Right.

1272
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:20.560
<v 2>What is that supposed to though?
No one's supposed to be anywhere.</v>

1273
01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:24.580
There's no one's supposed to be controlling the fucking oil either.
Everywhere.

1274
01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:26.540
There's no,
no one is supposed to be anywhere though.

1275
01:15:26.541 --> 01:15:30.180
The whole idea is ridiculous and I think it's going to break down.

1276
01:15:30.330 --> 01:15:33.310
You just can't see it.
Keep going.
I think it's just like everything else.

1277
01:15:33.311 --> 01:15:37.990
It's been slowly but surely dissolving around us.
Yeah.
I think,

1278
01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:41.980
you know,
as technology increases,
it's our access to each other increases.

1279
01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:43.490
There's going to be,

1280
01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:46.630
it's going to be way easier to decipher what other people are saying.
You know,

1281
01:15:46.631 --> 01:15:51.631
the whole idea about the tower of Babel keep man forever divided by making a

1282
01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.970
gang of different languages so they can never completely communicate with each

1283
01:15:54.971 --> 01:15:57.640
other.
That's all slowly being broken down.

1284
01:15:57.641 --> 01:15:59.500
And it's one of the biggest impediments to piece.

1285
01:15:59.501 --> 01:16:01.810
It's one of the biggest impediments,
cultural understanding.

1286
01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:06.670
Like I love watching shows about other countries about how they eat and what

1287
01:16:06.671 --> 01:16:10.300
they do.
Like I love Anthony Bourdain's Charles specially.
Oh yeah,
me too.

1288
01:16:10.301 --> 01:16:15.010
I could watch anything that guy does.
He's an awesome dude too.
Um,
and he,

1289
01:16:15.011 --> 01:16:16.570
uh,
he goes over to,

1290
01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.590
he goes over each of the eat cow models and he was there when they slaughtered

1291
01:16:20.591 --> 01:16:23.860
it.
They killed the camel in front of them.
My God,
it didn't slaughtered it.

1292
01:16:23.861 --> 01:16:27.310
And you know,
and they,
they're all cooking.
They eat it with their hands.
They all,

1293
01:16:27.311 --> 01:16:30.350
you know,
it's like,
it's really kind of crazy.
Like can you like,

1294
01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:32.160
you never shake hands with your left hand.
Right,

1295
01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.430
because they don't use toilet paper.

1296
01:16:33.490 --> 01:16:36.590
They're her ass assholes left hand and they eat with their right hand.

1297
01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.460
They shake hands,

1298
01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:40.720
the right hand and then you keep your fucking right hand clean bitch cause

1299
01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:42.840
you're going to shake my hand and I'm going to eat better.

1300
01:16:42.841 --> 01:16:46.120
Not Be wiping your ass with your right hand.
They tell it's really important.

1301
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:49.010
Yeah they have like it makes sense though if you think about the down to

1302
01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.490
<v 3>yeah cause I asked this guy once,
it was like,
did you,</v>

1303
01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.510
do you really use your hand?

1304
01:16:52.511 --> 01:16:54.630
And he's like as much cleaner and when you think about it,

1305
01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:55.720
he's like you Americans,

1306
01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:59.050
you take toilet paper and then you mash the shit against your app.

1307
01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:02.470
Like you mash it against you.
It's just disgusting.
He's like me,

1308
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:05.020
I've done my hat and I use mine and then I washed my hand.
I'm like do you,

1309
01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:06.380
so it's like what's soap

1310
01:17:08.450 --> 01:17:10.190
soap was what makes you smell not like

1311
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:11.023
<v 0>you,</v>

1312
01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:15.470
but then you see them shifting off of the um,

1313
01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:16.670
<v 3>yeah.
So,
yeah,</v>

1314
01:17:16.671 --> 01:17:20.300
I was on an oil platform in between Iran and Iraq and the middle of nowhere in

1315
01:17:20.301 --> 01:17:24.200
the ocean now.
And it's a mile long platform.
Half American marines,

1316
01:17:24.201 --> 01:17:28.790
half Iraqi soldiers,
and were teaching the Iraqi's how to guard their oil.

1317
01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:33.170
That's the theory.
And anyways,
the uh,
the Iraqi barracks,
I got to tour them.

1318
01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.071
Not so nice.

1319
01:17:34.071 --> 01:17:38.150
Like those dudes were shitting off the side of the platform and then the fish

1320
01:17:38.151 --> 01:17:42.230
that were eating the shit,
they would fish those fish and then eat the fish.

1321
01:17:42.330 --> 01:17:45.340
<v 7>Oh yeah.</v>

1322
01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:48.430
<v 3>A lot of filth.
The fuck Thursday.
No,
that's,</v>

1323
01:17:48.431 --> 01:17:51.940
I don't know if that's just negative propaganda.
Oh Man.
Love Thursday.

1324
01:17:51.941 --> 01:17:56.710
That's what the Americans say that it's 100% fact.
Yeah.

1325
01:17:57.390 --> 01:18:01.980
According to that,
he said he knows that he's been there by crime.

1326
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:05.110
Broke down crying,
flatter bro.
Bro.

1327
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:09.930
Niggas Shady Keegan.
Yeah,
they're nasty though.

1328
01:18:09.931 --> 01:18:14.350
Or mattresses were all brown and grody and savage.
Yeah.

1329
01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:17.980
I don't give a shit like we do about it because they don't give a shit or they

1330
01:18:17.981 --> 01:18:19.930
don't have the money.
Um,
well we were,

1331
01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.720
we were training them and providing them with supplies.

1332
01:18:22.721 --> 01:18:25.330
So at the time they did have access to these things,

1333
01:18:25.331 --> 01:18:28.300
like we gave them a bunch of water bottles and we're like,
dude,
just put this,

1334
01:18:28.301 --> 01:18:31.180
you know,
and it was all over.
They were throw the water bottles,

1335
01:18:31.181 --> 01:18:34.840
it just all over the floor as opposed to like putting them in the refrigerator

1336
01:18:34.841 --> 01:18:36.770
that the Americans had provided so

1337
01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:41.550
<v 0>well,
they were probably like really disenchanted,
you know?</v>

1338
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:43.770
I mean their country got conquered.
Everyone they know.

1339
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:45.960
<v 3>Oh yeah,
I totally agree.
And you're like,</v>

1340
01:18:45.961 --> 01:18:47.490
why are you telling me how to do my thing?

1341
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:52.590
<v 0>Did you ever think about how you would react to just one example of what we do</v>

1342
01:18:53.411 --> 01:18:56.740
to another country?
You could see it.
We can see it in the south,
in the north.

1343
01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.870
Have you ever gone to the south and people call you a Yankee?

1344
01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:04.090
I've had people call me Yankees before.
And you're just fucking Yankee.
Yeah.

1345
01:19:04.150 --> 01:19:08.630
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm worse than a Yankee Dude.
I'm a foreigner.
Like I said,

1346
01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.800
my family came from other countries.
Yeah,
no,

1347
01:19:10.930 --> 01:19:13.330
I wasn't here when your bullshit was going on with those people.

1348
01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:17.980
Wait until they see Palicki.
Oh Jesus.
Oh my God.
Well you some ground of new Ju.

1349
01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.400
Yeah,
totally new kind of Jew.

1350
01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.830
<v 3>But I remember this when I was on that oil platform,</v>

1351
01:19:22.890 --> 01:19:25.920
they had this thing where I was like operation win hearts and minds.

1352
01:19:27.610 --> 01:19:31.530
This is,
this is the craziest thing.
I Rockwell just fuck the army in its mouth.

1353
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:34.710
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh you die.

1354
01:19:34.711 --> 01:19:39.540
So once a week they had ice cream socials with the Iraqis and they would fucking

1355
01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:44.541
find a way to get tubs of rocky road ice cream airlifted onto this oil platform.

1356
01:19:45.421 --> 01:19:46.350
And then we would,

1357
01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:50.160
I would be having ice cream with the Iraqis so that they would see how amazing

1358
01:19:50.161 --> 01:19:53.400
our American rocky road.
Isn't everything amazing in America?

1359
01:19:53.401 --> 01:19:56.760
Like don't you want this?
Yeah.
Like yeah this is pretty good.
Fuck it.

1360
01:19:56.761 --> 01:20:00.150
I'm just going to take back my grandmother getting their head blown off in front

1361
01:20:00.151 --> 01:20:02.340
of him.
Right,
right.
I'm defecting.
This is amazing.

1362
01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:05.100
<v 0>It's got chocolate chunks in it.
You don't like that?
Wow.</v>

1363
01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.560
Does it make you forget about your loss?
Almost everyone.
My family,

1364
01:20:07.561 --> 01:20:12.380
but I think it was worth it.
Yeah.
Cause this is Coleen swirl,
right.
Delicious.

1365
01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:16.190
That is so hilarious.
I remember your nephew now,
right?
Yeah.
An ice cream.

1366
01:20:16.191 --> 01:20:19.220
I need your kids.
You've got rocky road.
It's so hilarious.
Yeah.

1367
01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:22.830
Weird fucking thing.

1368
01:20:22.831 --> 01:20:26.280
That is what a weird fucking thing it is to just go into another country and

1369
01:20:26.281 --> 01:20:28.860
kill everybody and then give them stuff and then we need this.

1370
01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:32.790
We need to set up permanently here guys,
after we've killed everybody.

1371
01:20:32.791 --> 01:20:34.950
We're going to be here awhile and we don't know.

1372
01:20:34.951 --> 01:20:36.510
We don't think you can do this on your own,

1373
01:20:36.511 --> 01:20:40.560
even though you did this on your own since like the nine hundreds.
Yeah.
Right,

1374
01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:43.290
right.
I'm going to have to have to go.
Okay.
You're,
you're right.

1375
01:20:43.291 --> 01:20:44.220
We won't get upset.
Well,

1376
01:20:44.221 --> 01:20:47.430
that's the second time that someone has done that to Baghdad.
It's a,

1377
01:20:47.490 --> 01:20:51.210
I've been listening to for the past couple of years.

1378
01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:55.660
Dan Carlin's hardcore history.
Yeah.
Just about a year.
A year and a half.
Um,

1379
01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:00.570
and he has this amazing series about the Mongols.
It's called a,
yeah.

1380
01:21:00.571 --> 01:21:03.790
The Mongol invasions.
What do you like Hungarians are,

1381
01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:07.140
are you guys one of the Margiela?
Really?
The Mongols fucked all you.

1382
01:21:07.141 --> 01:21:10.380
That's why they came in and fucked everybody.
Yes,

1383
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:15.360
but he has this whole piece about them taking over Baghdad and you kind of

1384
01:21:15.361 --> 01:21:17.790
understand why the Middle East so fucked up once you hear it.

1385
01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:21.780
They killed everybody.
They threw all of the writing into the river.

1386
01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:25.230
They said the river ran were black with ink and red with blood.

1387
01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.480
She killed everybody,
like literally killed everybody.

1388
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:28.860
Like they killed a million people.

1389
01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:32.910
I think they would kill people and they would come back two weeks later to see

1390
01:21:32.911 --> 01:21:36.210
if anybody was cleaning up the bodies and they kill them.
Jesus sound,

1391
01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.190
they didn't fuck around.
It's effective.

1392
01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:42.660
And there they say that Baghdad never really recovered.
And like the,

1393
01:21:42.661 --> 01:21:45.330
essentially in the 1,212 whatever it was,

1394
01:21:45.331 --> 01:21:50.160
when kingus Khan did all that crazy shit from then until now,

1395
01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:53.730
they've never recovered.
But back then they were the pinnacle of civilization.

1396
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:57.570
They were like scholars and scientists and,
and they,

1397
01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:01.860
they were excellent keepers of records.
All that went in the river.
Bitch,

1398
01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:03.600
I'm just cut everybody's head off.

1399
01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:06.580
<v 3>And that's it.
Once you're intellectual history is gone.</v>

1400
01:22:06.710 --> 01:22:10.220
<v 0>Yeah,
it's done.
You start from scratch and everyone's dead now,
by the way,</v>

1401
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:11.143
this might be,
yeah.

1402
01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:14.990
<v 3>Uh,
a hippy dippy Doby thought a pot thought,</v>

1403
01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:19.730
but I fear that our culture is going that way because of the disappearance of

1404
01:22:19.731 --> 01:22:24.580
the bookstore because of the disappearance of book learning,
book reading.
Uh,

1405
01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:27.230
because of like the nooks and,
oh,
just download that.

1406
01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:30.290
You understand like there's a process when you go into a bookstore and you go

1407
01:22:30.291 --> 01:22:33.470
home interested in this topic and you point your finger and you go,

1408
01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:38.470
what's that like?
What's that?
I feel like that experience is gone.
Yeah.

1409
01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:42.500
I feel like we're totally regressing into idiocracy and it is going that

1410
01:22:42.501 --> 01:22:43.140
direction.

1411
01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:46.950
<v 0>Well,
we are,
have always gone to the path of least resistance.</v>

1412
01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:50.970
Every person does.
You know,
you have to fight to not do that.
Right.

1413
01:22:50.971 --> 01:22:55.470
And the path of least resistance is he just watched TV sitting on the couch.

1414
01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:59.940
She can just go order some takeout is just get a pizza delivered.
Let's just,

1415
01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:04.830
yeah,
the path of least resistance is not going to the bookstore.
Getting a book,

1416
01:23:04.831 --> 01:23:06.040
sitting home,
reading

1417
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:10.780
<v 2>it,
absorbing it.
Right.
It's now sitting in front of a television.
Yeah.</v>

1418
01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:15.250
Yeah.
We just,
we have,
so like going to the supermarket to get your food.

1419
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:17.260
That's another thing that's probably not good.

1420
01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.540
It's probably be better if everybody grew their own food.

1421
01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:23.830
If we had like community gardens and everybody grew their own food and you know,

1422
01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:27.640
Indian,
if you don't eat meat,
all you really need is some chickens.
You know,

1423
01:23:27.641 --> 01:23:31.270
if you have a bunch of hens,
they don't,
they lay eggs.
You don't have to,

1424
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:32.920
you're not killing a chicken.
Right?

1425
01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:37.030
Like those eggs will never become a chicken unless a roosters in the house.

1426
01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:38.740
Right?
So if the roosters banging them,

1427
01:23:38.741 --> 01:23:41.530
then those chickens have the potential to have a baby.

1428
01:23:41.531 --> 01:23:44.920
But otherwise it just laying eggs that are free food,
right.
You feed them,

1429
01:23:44.921 --> 01:23:47.650
you give them your table scraps,
like vegetables and stuff.
They eat it,

1430
01:23:47.651 --> 01:23:50.800
they love it.
You let them run around your yard and pick up your grass.

1431
01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:54.040
That's like a smart way to live.
The way we do it.

1432
01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:56.500
We're not connected to our fucking food.

1433
01:23:56.530 --> 01:24:00.070
And I think that just like being not connected and information,

1434
01:24:00.071 --> 01:24:03.910
not reading books anymore and not exploring and learning ideas that was bad for

1435
01:24:03.911 --> 01:24:05.440
him.
But I think on the other hand,

1436
01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:09.250
there's never been more information available to everybody on your phone,

1437
01:24:09.251 --> 01:24:10.240
on a computer.

1438
01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:13.380
<v 3>But I agree with you,
but it's an abridged weird version.</v>

1439
01:24:13.381 --> 01:24:15.640
There's something different about reading.
Um,

1440
01:24:15.870 --> 01:24:17.310
let's say you want to know what Nisha said.

1441
01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:20.790
There's a huge difference between picking up beyond good and evil and reading

1442
01:24:20.791 --> 01:24:23.100
that bitch cover to cover and being like,
wow,

1443
01:24:23.101 --> 01:24:25.380
there's this and that idea and making connections.

1444
01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:27.970
Then going to Wikipedia and being like,
Frederick Nietzsche,

1445
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:31.170
what did that guy say?
God is dead.
Got It.
Onto the next thing.

1446
01:24:31.171 --> 01:24:33.630
And you quoted on a message board does seem like a genius,
you know?

1447
01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:37.320
Of course there's a huge,
who said that bro?
That's when you throw in,

1448
01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:43.050
let's say someone says something and you Google the debunked and then you pick

1449
01:24:43.261 --> 01:24:44.580
out a quote from that.
And See,

1450
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:50.030
this goes back to why our relationship works is because I don't let her

1451
01:24:50.101 --> 01:24:53.980
smartness upset me.
Right?
Tommy?

1452
01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:59.430
I don't know.
No,
I,
I'm,
I'm serious.
I think w what makes it work is that,
you know,

1453
01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:04.380
you like your book and then you're reading and uh,
I'll,
I'll actually go,

1454
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:05.970
you know what,
I should read a book.

1455
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.160
I use it as inspiration for your reader that yeah,

1456
01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:12.600
but I download my books onto my iPad.
I used to now though,

1457
01:25:12.601 --> 01:25:13.770
I'm not saying that that's a no,
no,

1458
01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:16.470
but I'm saying it is an extension of what we're talking about.
Like you know,

1459
01:25:16.471 --> 01:25:19.680
you have good habits that I,
you know,
copy,
I go,

1460
01:25:19.950 --> 01:25:22.050
I should read a book because you're reading so many books.

1461
01:25:22.051 --> 01:25:25.110
Do you know what I learned from you that you should watch a football?
Football?

1462
01:25:25.111 --> 01:25:25.680
No,

1463
01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:30.680
I learned how to deal with like white dudes because I kinda know like Tommy,

1464
01:25:30.771 --> 01:25:35.760
he's really good at dealing with like white dude America,
like business things.

1465
01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:39.480
And I learned from him.
Like I watch him how he does all white dudes.
Yeah,

1466
01:25:39.481 --> 01:25:42.120
like the man,
you know what I'm saying?
Like the mass and stuff.

1467
01:25:42.121 --> 01:25:43.200
Cause I'm not good at that.

1468
01:25:43.201 --> 01:25:46.800
Like you're supposed to get some juice to do that for you.
I totally have them.

1469
01:25:46.801 --> 01:25:50.070
Thank you.
Yes,
I have.
I have it marked Jews.

1470
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:55.110
They seem to have a good grip on how to run they business industry.

1471
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:56.190
What's that about?

1472
01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:00.130
<v 2>I think that people,
I think first of all,
I think a lot of Jews are smart.</v>

1473
01:26:00.131 --> 01:26:04.260
If you look at the amount of our smart,
yeah.
If you look at the amount of um,
uh,

1474
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:09.430
Nobel prize winners and in science and like there's an and PhDs,

1475
01:26:10.490 --> 01:26:15.350
a shitload of them are Jewish from,
uh,
from,
uh,
from,
uh,

1476
01:26:15.351 --> 01:26:19.880
Europe,
European Jews.
It's amazing how many of them.
It's amazing.
So it's like,

1477
01:26:19.881 --> 01:26:21.980
it's,
it's a staggering number.
You know,

1478
01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:25.670
I think it's just an excellent gene pool as far as intellectual.

1479
01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:30.680
Is that why they're so,
it's a good culture to be born into culturally,

1480
01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:34.880
like,
you know,
it's a supportive atmosphere.
It's,
it's the,

1481
01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:40.060
it's the atmosphere a lot of times of like helping bringing people along,

1482
01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:44.240
sparring.
But there's a seclusion neri thing that they have going on a bed.

1483
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:48.090
They kind of exclude everybody else out of their community because you don't,

1484
01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:51.590
and just if you looked at it,
I mean I hate to be a Jew lover here,

1485
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:56.950
but if you looked at it in terms of just accomplishments and just,

1486
01:26:57.350 --> 01:27:00.950
it makes sense that they would want to keep everybody out.

1487
01:27:00.951 --> 01:27:05.180
If you looked at the amount of shit that they've pulled off,
like intellectually,

1488
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:07.700
like the amount of things that the Jewish people have done.

1489
01:27:07.730 --> 01:27:09.950
I mean it's really kind of staggering,

1490
01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:12.200
especially compared to my more on people we,

1491
01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:14.210
my morning people have like Michelangelo,

1492
01:27:14.211 --> 01:27:16.550
Leonardo Vinci and everybody else was retarded.

1493
01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:21.340
<v 0>Yeah.
You make cars and a bunch of</v>

1494
01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:25.770
<v 2>souls who uh,
who look like me look like chimp people.
You know,</v>

1495
01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:29.440
there are a bunch of chimp people cause suits,
man.
Good tailors.
Yeah.

1496
01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:31.410
And my people are the,
the southern people.

1497
01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:34.500
My people are not the smart ones who look like Europeans.

1498
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:38.600
My people are the eight black characters.
It looks like a carried bricks up hill.

1499
01:27:40.450 --> 01:27:45.060
So when I say that these Jews are so much smarter than a lot of other

1500
01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:49.320
nationalities,
it's just a fact.
I mean,
it really is.

1501
01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:53.100
If you look at accomplishments,
let's not say they're smarter,

1502
01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:58.050
but they're exemplary for sure.
And so if they were that exemplary in that,

1503
01:27:58.350 --> 01:28:02.550
that accomplished as a,
as a race,
it makes sense.
They'd be exclusionary.

1504
01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:03.001
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1505
01:28:03.001 --> 01:28:07.310
We want to keep all my dumb genes from fucking their daughter shooting her up

1506
01:28:07.311 --> 01:28:12.311
with some live crazy load that's going to create some half smart half fucking

1507
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:16.400
ape kid going to run around on a ruined things to the Jewish school.

1508
01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:19.670
He'd be like,
Bro,
I'm not wearing a fucking Yamaka or,
right.
That shit stupid.

1509
01:28:19.671 --> 01:28:23.630
My Dad says it's dumb.
It's fuck.
And then I got to put your money.

1510
01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.850
God wants you to wear a beanie dude.
Seriously,

1511
01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:29.720
we've got this genius that just joined our tribe guys.
God will flowers.

1512
01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:32.900
God made beehives and he wants you to wear a beanie.
Shut the fuck up.

1513
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:37.580
It also keeps,
if you're that exclusion there,
you get to keep like,
uh,
you know,

1514
01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:42.480
outside competition from your businesses.
Yes.
That's awesome.
Nepotism.
Also,

1515
01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:44.210
that is also an immigrant practice.

1516
01:28:44.211 --> 01:28:49.040
My father is Hungarian and he'd primarily deals with other Hungarians or eastern

1517
01:28:49.041 --> 01:28:53.720
European.
Not other tribes,
other tribes.

1518
01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:57.170
He's very explicit,
but that's a common immigrant thing to do as well.

1519
01:28:57.171 --> 01:28:59.330
The Asians deal with the Asians,
et Cetera,

1520
01:28:59.930 --> 01:29:04.760
and somehow know that they've made blow jobs.
Less of a taboo did Jews,

1521
01:29:04.990 --> 01:29:09.180
the Jewish girls always enjoyed the blowjobs and much more than the American

1522
01:29:09.181 --> 01:29:11.460
girls felt like they were doing a massive favor.

1523
01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:15.940
Think that stops when she married him though.
Yes,
that's what I've heard.
Yeah.

1524
01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:19.380
That's a wrap.
That's the fucking bait and switch.
Right?
That's a wrap by nagging.

1525
01:29:19.410 --> 01:29:23.100
They,
but they like it.
Like when I was in high school,
that was the word.

1526
01:29:23.101 --> 01:29:26.550
The word was that Jewish girls give head and they liked it.
Let's do a poll.

1527
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:29.190
They're always freaking or in the sack I think,

1528
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:33.420
but maybe to asses,
but you know,

1529
01:29:33.421 --> 01:29:36.660
but they also have that reputation of being naggy and they have the reputation

1530
01:29:36.661 --> 01:29:40.860
of not,
you know,
not being a sexual prejudice against Italians.

1531
01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:44.100
I also heard that I'm definitely prejudice against Italians.
Yeah.
Are you,

1532
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:45.143
I don't fuck my

1533
01:29:47.050 --> 01:29:50.610
fuck my people since the early eighties really.
I learned a long,

1534
01:29:50.670 --> 01:29:54.750
long time ago to keep away from my people.
Jewish girls,
savages,

1535
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:59.010
champ people,
the chimp people.
I've only had one girl swinging.
We ever,

1536
01:29:59.011 --> 01:30:02.810
she was Italian full blown.
This bitch took a wind up cause she like,
uh,

1537
01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:06.420
like a fucking jersey shore kind of bitch.
Long Island,
long island,

1538
01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:09.510
which was crazy.
And she's ready to go to war.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1539
01:30:09.511 --> 01:30:12.630
I mean I didn't hit her back.
I just grabbed a hold of her.
I'm like,

1540
01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:17.070
we don't have to do this.
Let's not,
let's not turn this into a slug fest.

1541
01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:22.740
Oh you can't do that.
You can't get a slug fest with a check.

1542
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.760
I mean girls came with other girls but,
well you know,
but,

1543
01:30:27.761 --> 01:30:32.310
but my point is I've never had a white girl swinging at me other than Italians.

1544
01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:36.450
Yeah.
Been very drunk.
Katie remember her?
I was talking to that kid.
He's awesome.

1545
01:30:36.490 --> 01:30:37.230
<v 3>Yeah.
Located,</v>

1546
01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:42.220
I was talking to her yesterday and she was reminded me of that time were date

1547
01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:46.540
somebody in the audience.
Davey was on on a stage.
David,
the guy that has,

1548
01:30:46.570 --> 01:30:51.390
you know the,
he walks funny.
He was cerebral palsy.
Yeah.
Walks funny.
So,

1549
01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:56.590
so,
so he uh,
somebody yelled out like,
you're not funny.
Retard to him cheese.

1550
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:58.450
And Katie was waiting.

1551
01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:01.480
She was a waitress there at the time and she came up and goes,

1552
01:31:01.481 --> 01:31:03.520
did you just say he was retarding with yeah,

1553
01:31:03.521 --> 01:31:07.850
and she just punched him and knocked him out.
Knocked him out.
Jesus name.

1554
01:31:08.110 --> 01:31:11.100
Well you got to throw that all through the red band filter whether or not she

1555
01:31:12.330 --> 01:31:15.300
did.
She heard him.
Oh,
she said,
yeah,
yeah,
I'll let you go.

1556
01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:19.750
She's from Boston and she's like a boss.
She will punch somebody.
Hilarious.

1557
01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:25.080
<v 0>We had some of the funniest times at that store talking to like her and Eleanor.</v>

1558
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:28.320
Eleanor was now finally doing comedy.
I don't know.

1559
01:31:28.330 --> 01:31:32.810
Our Kerrigan is fucking hilarious and she's always been hilarious.
Yeah.

1560
01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:36.130
Like when she finally started doing comedy,
I was like,
wow,

1561
01:31:36.131 --> 01:31:38.050
why didn't you do this a long time ago?
You know,

1562
01:31:38.051 --> 01:31:42.070
you are always aware and she's a hack detective.

1563
01:31:42.510 --> 01:31:44.530
You know like I would,
I would say like a,

1564
01:31:44.531 --> 01:31:48.190
everybody says this guys with funny is he funny and she would go if you like old

1565
01:31:48.191 --> 01:31:52.630
stupid premises,
really done.
And then she would like walk off like she,

1566
01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:57.520
she knew,
she knew it was bullshit and what was and she knew about dance moves.

1567
01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:03.760
Tommy Tommy's word for like what a joke's not really that fun and you're trying

1568
01:32:03.761 --> 01:32:06.250
to jazz it up,
give it some dance moves.

1569
01:32:06.251 --> 01:32:09.460
I would call an English putting English on the cue ball and make it spin around

1570
01:32:09.461 --> 01:32:12.060
for no reason when you have to really work it.
Oh I know.

1571
01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:15.610
Believe me in the south you have to do that a little bit.
Do you think so?
Yeah.

1572
01:32:15.611 --> 01:32:20.170
I shuck and Jive a lot harder.
I slow it down too.

1573
01:32:20.171 --> 01:32:22.120
I slow it down.
I've always had this,

1574
01:32:22.121 --> 01:32:24.690
I think it's way harder for a woman to do stand up.
Yeah.

1575
01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:28.270
It gets harder to get the attention on stage from men,

1576
01:32:28.330 --> 01:32:32.960
men to give you the ball,
you know,
because guys will,
hey,
I'm funnier news bill.

1577
01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:37.840
Hi.
It's,
you can't,
you can't have opinions on things.

1578
01:32:37.841 --> 01:32:42.010
You certainly can't have opinions on like religion or politics or anything

1579
01:32:42.011 --> 01:32:45.220
controversial where you or I could pull off,
you know,

1580
01:32:45.221 --> 01:32:46.540
like I don't agree with this guy,
but,

1581
01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:52.230
but if a woman like a woman's onstage telling Jesus,
chokes,
very volatile,

1582
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:55.060
fuck yeah,
it's fall time.
But that's why it's so important.

1583
01:32:55.061 --> 01:32:59.590
And I think that that's why it's a good thing to do it well.
It's a important,

1584
01:32:59.591 --> 01:33:01.160
when they're funny,
like you know,

1585
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:04.120
that's when it's important because when they're not funny,

1586
01:33:04.121 --> 01:33:06.950
they should just quit because they're ruining the rest of the whole thing.
Yeah.

1587
01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:12.040
I can't say that because a lot of people start off not funny.
Funny.

1588
01:33:12.170 --> 01:33:14.120
<v 3>Yeah,
that's true.
Yeah,
man.</v>

1589
01:33:14.121 --> 01:33:18.200
Everybody ever don't you think every guy or every girl faces their own biases

1590
01:33:18.201 --> 01:33:21.650
socially before when you go up on stage,
the audience doesn't know who you are.

1591
01:33:21.890 --> 01:33:22.940
If you're a black guy,

1592
01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:26.270
the assumption is this guy's gone to be the funniest guy on the planet.

1593
01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:29.980
<v 0>Whitey
people do.</v>

1594
01:33:29.981 --> 01:33:33.550
I think he says generalized black dude's on stage though.

1595
01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:35.770
I think they give them more,
more props.
A lot of times,
yeah.

1596
01:33:35.771 --> 01:33:37.660
I kicked two black people.
They don't know what,

1597
01:33:37.661 --> 01:33:40.780
I think a lot of black people throughout history have been fantastic
performance.

1598
01:33:40.810 --> 01:33:45.250
Yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.
If you look at the number of people like all time,
you know,

1599
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:48.370
a number of black people and number of great black entertainers,

1600
01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:51.490
especially in stand up in May,
so disproportionate.
Yeah.

1601
01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:53.950
Because if you think of like the greatest comics of all time,
you know,

1602
01:33:53.951 --> 01:33:56.720
if you had to like do a hiker down,
yeah.
It's,

1603
01:33:56.721 --> 01:33:59.440
we're going to be more than 10 that are black,
you know,
I mean,

1604
01:33:59.441 --> 01:34:01.540
there's 10% of the population is black.

1605
01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.790
And if you took the hundred greatest comedians,

1606
01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:06.610
probably be like 50 of them be black.
Right?
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1607
01:34:06.611 --> 01:34:10.120
They're disproportionately funnier.
Yeah.
I mean there's,
I mean,
Eddie Murphy,

1608
01:34:10.121 --> 01:34:13.930
Chris Rock,
Richard Pryor,
Bill Cosby,
you know,

1609
01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:18.730
those are in the top five all time greats and there's four of them.

1610
01:34:18.731 --> 01:34:22.470
They're black.
Dave Chappelle,
five black guys right there.
Bang.
May,
may,
may,
may,

1611
01:34:22.471 --> 01:34:27.240
may,
may is very funny.
Jews are funny.
Yeah.
Jews are funny.
Yup.

1612
01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:31.180
And the Jews.
I watched some,
uh,
dude,
see if you can pull this,

1613
01:34:31.181 --> 01:34:33.070
cause it's kind of interesting.
Pull this up.

1614
01:34:33.250 --> 01:34:36.100
Rare footage of woody Allen doing stand up.

1615
01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:41.520
Woody Allen doing standup from 1965 he was funny.

1616
01:34:42.330 --> 01:34:46.540
He was young and he was,
you could tell he was perverted.
Tell you that.
Right?

1617
01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:51.270
<v 3>He's always is assessed with a young pussy.
That's always his theme.</v>

1618
01:34:51.271 --> 01:34:55.320
And every movie almost,
if you watch them,
it's redemption through young pussy.

1619
01:34:55.950 --> 01:34:58.010
Yeah.
I'm age and I never,
she

1620
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:01.700
<v 0>and it told us,
is that right?
Of course it's real.
Oh,</v>

1621
01:35:01.701 --> 01:35:04.960
is that where my dad doesn't drives get young pussy and they bang them and

1622
01:35:04.961 --> 01:35:05.794
they're like,
yeah,

1623
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:09.600
<v 6>yeah.
Redeeming.
Of course.
Look at this.
Watch this.
Yeah.</v>

1624
01:35:10.930 --> 01:35:15.080
<v 0>How old is it?
Does it say all these enterprise d five,
five.
Oh,</v>

1625
01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:19.950
that was short.
They never philosophy jokes and shit.
This Guy Museum of art,

1626
01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.730
<v 1>which is this fabulous museum,
we've gone,
oh,
it's a young guy.</v>

1627
01:35:24.150 --> 01:35:25.410
I used to hang out a lot.

1628
01:35:25.710 --> 01:35:30.710
The museum in search of a meaningful social relationships.

1629
01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.780
So they're used to look for girl.

1630
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:38.190
I saw on the world one.
Uh,

1631
01:35:38.191 --> 01:35:42.530
no by Rubens but a real succulent nude.
Uh Huh.

1632
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:49.130
<v 6>And make it a contrast this to me.
So like animated</v>

1633
01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.800
<v 1>emotionally involved with the paint thing,
you know to God how to restrain me.</v>

1634
01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:57.340
Right.
The lick.
Some of the oil.

1635
01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:03.381
No,
but that's high.

1636
01:36:03.381 --> 01:36:06.970
Where is it that I could meet the kind of girl that would pose but that type

1637
01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:09.020
picture I had in my neighborhood,

1638
01:36:09.021 --> 01:36:13.640
there's an art supply shop that deals in offbeat thing that I read it down there

1639
01:36:13.641 --> 01:36:16.370
and I get the name of the artist bottle off the wall.

1640
01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:20.630
I called her up and I came on very strong like an artist.

1641
01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:23.710
But you know I used a lot of 30 autistic firms like brush

1642
01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:30.500
though I was just adorable and we agreed on this price,
you know,
and hung up,

1643
01:36:31.390 --> 01:36:34.790
press stop and my and Baret you know,

1644
01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:37.460
little Harvey's Bristol Cream on the head

1645
01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:41.660
<v 6>too much.
What I want to be</v>

1646
01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:49.160
<v 1>now related is a knock on my door head standing there,</v>

1647
01:36:49.161 --> 01:36:54.020
just this fabulous woman we meet.
Say Shit,
I let her in quickly,
you know,

1648
01:36:54.021 --> 01:36:57.040
and I lock the door with my police lock beat.

1649
01:36:58.650 --> 01:37:02.900
<v 6>We'd take off right away cause I don't know much about art,</v>

1650
01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:06.500
but I know what I like.
Fuck.

1651
01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:10.440
Look at his face.
She took her off everything.

1652
01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:14.250
<v 1>Thank [inaudible] very professional and calls nine began to shake.</v>

1653
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:17.700
That's my thing.
I,
yeah,
all the time.

1654
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:22.530
I not good at those kind of situations or perspiring audibly.

1655
01:37:24.110 --> 01:37:28.200
She's standing there in front of me,
majestic.
I took my piece of paper,

1656
01:37:28.201 --> 01:37:30.810
like chocolate pencil and I went up to her.

1657
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:35.310
I like got into a little trouble with that because I tried to trace her sure.

1658
01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:40.460
Living as I do in a rich neighborhood.

1659
01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:47.220
<v 0>It's,
he's,
it's,
it's fascinating because he is kinkiness oh,
for sure.</v>

1660
01:37:47.221 --> 01:37:51.780
Yeah.
By the way,
you,
do you know how racy that was in 1965 on television?

1661
01:37:51.810 --> 01:37:54.930
Wow.
Yeah.
I think it was on television.
I mean,
it's being filmed,
whatever it is.

1662
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.410
Yeah.
Um,
that,
that's,
what does it say where it was from?

1663
01:37:58.950 --> 01:38:02.220
Does it say like a show or anything is weird or is in front of a staircase?

1664
01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:06.000
Shitty set did,
didn't know about sets.
Back then.
TV was only 10 years old.

1665
01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:08.830
It doesn't say,
but you could,

1666
01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:12.780
when you stop and knowing what you know now and you watch that video,

1667
01:38:12.810 --> 01:38:17.130
isn't that something?
What a nightmare that must've been for everybody involved.

1668
01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:20.790
Oh my God.
God craziness.
Huh?
You're,
you're,

1669
01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:25.740
you and your wife get divorced and you are now banging his daughter,

1670
01:38:25.741 --> 01:38:28.710
her daughter that used to be your daughter,
and now it's your wife adopted.

1671
01:38:28.890 --> 01:38:30.780
You're adopted daughter,
adopted daughter.

1672
01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:35.670
It's not as weird who trusts you as a parental figure,

1673
01:38:35.730 --> 01:38:36.960
but it's so weird.
I mean,

1674
01:38:36.961 --> 01:38:41.210
has it ever been done by a public figure like that before Roman Polanski was

1675
01:38:41.211 --> 01:38:44.700
bang,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Nothing like that,
but nothing like that.
No.
Yeah,

1676
01:38:44.770 --> 01:38:48.660
he raped a girl.
I mean,
Roman Polanski did a really horrible clinic.

1677
01:38:48.670 --> 01:38:51.990
Jerry Lee Lewis.
Yeah.
That's different too.

1678
01:38:51.991 --> 01:38:54.690
That's different to this is you're the,
you're the parental figure.

1679
01:38:54.691 --> 01:38:58.590
The parental figure is a way more disturbing prospect.

1680
01:38:59.210 --> 01:39:01.420
That's the Mo.
The most disturbing.
Yeah,
sure.

1681
01:39:01.421 --> 01:39:04.260
That's the one that makes you just unforgivably disturbing.

1682
01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:07.830
But the cut the hot can't help with the hot one.

1683
01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:13.350
That's what people will say.
Well in the wife,
man,

1684
01:39:13.351 --> 01:39:16.990
she seems like she's off the rails.

1685
01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:23.240
She seems off the rails banging Sinatra when she was like 15 and her son is not,

1686
01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:26.240
her son is not woody Allen's son or sons.
Sinatra son.

1687
01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:29.850
Cause that's like confirm though,
right isn't.
No,
it's totally confirmed.

1688
01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:34.050
Look at them.
Yeah,
pull up the picture.
Mia Farrow son is Sinatra son.

1689
01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:37.710
Wait til you see him.
The you.
All you have to do is look at them and you go,

1690
01:39:37.711 --> 01:39:41.250
that is Sinatra.
Did she get hooked up with Sinatra?

1691
01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:42.840
Was slinging Dick.

1692
01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:47.970
He's out there with the boys.
A dino.

1693
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.480
How much did he crush back in the day?
Sinatra.

1694
01:39:55.770 --> 01:39:59.880
Whoa.
Easy Open.
He commissioned our fucking do it.

1695
01:39:59.970 --> 01:40:03.780
You guys have a list here.
One of the board.
Bang Dead Guy's dead guy.

1696
01:40:03.781 --> 01:40:08.040
Everyone dead.
Puerto Rican dead.
Look at him.
Just shut the fuck up.

1697
01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:12.840
That is Frank Sinatra's kid.
Period.

1698
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:16.450
There's no woody Allen and do that sexy Bastard Gorges.
Yeah.

1699
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:19.260
How they blocked the director out of their lives.
She,

1700
01:40:19.261 --> 01:40:22.590
I wonder why he seems like he's just want to leave them around when your kids,

1701
01:40:23.010 --> 01:40:26.840
especially once your kids that came like 1617 Asian flower.

1702
01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:32.490
I just want to touch it with like tongue.
I want it to leak.
The oils.

1703
01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:36.360
The painting.
Yeah.
He's like in that video of him doing stand up,
he's like,

1704
01:40:36.361 --> 01:40:41.361
so relishing in his perversion also seems like really satisfied with themselves.

1705
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:45.910
It's weird.
Get the fuck Outta here.
Oh,

1706
01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:50.250
that kid is mia farrow and Frank Sinatra.
I mean that is,

1707
01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:53.290
there is no woody Allen and that mother fucker at all.
No,

1708
01:40:54.570 --> 01:40:58.450
<v 3>my last year started his career.
What do y'all started doing comedy?</v>

1709
01:40:58.451 --> 01:40:59.680
Like writing as a comedy writer.

1710
01:40:59.681 --> 01:41:02.570
He dropped out of college at like the age of 20 he studied philosophy.
Yeah.

1711
01:41:02.571 --> 01:41:04.180
And then he became a comedy writer.

1712
01:41:04.450 --> 01:41:07.330
Like dudes like him have just been grandfathered into showbiz.

1713
01:41:07.331 --> 01:41:10.570
Like I was watching a documentary on Johnny Carson.
Like,
do you realize it?

1714
01:41:10.571 --> 01:41:13.960
Carson's been on television since television was invented.

1715
01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:17.200
Like in the Midwest.
There was one TV station,

1716
01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:21.130
Carson was on that from the time he was like 18 years old.
Right.
Why?

1717
01:41:21.170 --> 01:41:24.010
And then he's like,
one day I got a call from NBC and they were like,

1718
01:41:24.011 --> 01:41:26.350
do you want a TV show?
What's TV?
Okay.

1719
01:41:26.351 --> 01:41:28.870
And he's been on it since the very beginning.

1720
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:30.790
It was on it rather than he's dead now,
I'll be asleep.

1721
01:41:31.170 --> 01:41:34.090
But he was a real antisocial piece of shit at home.

1722
01:41:34.091 --> 01:41:36.100
Like they totally ignored his wife and kids.

1723
01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:39.970
Like he would come home and just sleep on the couch and be like,
fuck off.

1724
01:41:40.140 --> 01:41:43.110
<v 0>Did you hear it?
But he was so friendly out in the real world,</v>

1725
01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:45.720
like out in front of the camera.

1726
01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:50.610
Do you think that maybe he just was overwhelmed by all the people that see Tom?

1727
01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:54.430
He was constantly seeing giant crowds of people and everybody were,

1728
01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:55.320
wherever he went,

1729
01:41:55.650 --> 01:41:59.220
he was like getting interviewed and people were coming up to them and

1730
01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:03.210
<v 3>that,
and I know that he had a very disapproving mother,</v>

1731
01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:07.260
that his mother was like,
well,
he got the tonight show or something.

1732
01:42:07.261 --> 01:42:10.410
And his mom was like,
yeah,
big deal.
Like you still suck.
You're still not funny.

1733
01:42:10.411 --> 01:42:13.740
So I think there was some of that always wanting mom's approval.

1734
01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:15.570
That hamster wheel.

1735
01:42:15.710 --> 01:42:18.770
<v 0>Well,
that's even less reasonable then because when I see people like that,</v>

1736
01:42:18.771 --> 01:42:21.310
they know what it's like to have shitty parents.
Right.

1737
01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:22.700
Pay attention to their own kids,

1738
01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:26.330
like to do for you to perpetrate the same stupid shit that you went through

1739
01:42:26.331 --> 01:42:28.990
because you're too dumb to figure out what fucked you up.
But isn't

1740
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:31.600
<v 3>at the beginning of the show.</v>

1741
01:42:31.601 --> 01:42:35.140
How if you're not cognizant of what decisions you're making,
if you don't,

1742
01:42:35.170 --> 01:42:38.710
if you don't know how to think,
then you're a full life is in shambles around.

1743
01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:39.420
Yeah.

1744
01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:43.230
<v 0>Did you hear about the Johnny Carson's book that just came out and it talks</v>

1745
01:42:43.231 --> 01:42:46.830
about him and his ex wife who,
uh,

1746
01:42:47.010 --> 01:42:50.890
I guess he was married to this woman that cheated on him with a Frank Gifford.

1747
01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:54.990
Uh,
Kathy.
What's her face?
Just the names.
Kathy Lee Gifford.
Hussman.
Yeah,

1748
01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:58.620
frank TMZ.
Now what the fuck?
Well,

1749
01:42:58.621 --> 01:43:01.350
like Johnny Carson like broken to,
uh,

1750
01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:06.860
his house or her house and found all these photos of his wife and him together

1751
01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:10.830
and had a gun in his pocket.
And he like,
this is all allegedly though,
right?

1752
01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:14.190
There's none of this was like,
no,
this is all this,
all this is all really true.

1753
01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:14.970
But how do you know?

1754
01:43:14.970 --> 01:43:19.970
Because it like his friends are word there and they're like Ed Mcmahon and stuff

1755
01:43:20.041 --> 01:43:20.490
like that.

1756
01:43:20.490 --> 01:43:24.780
And so Ed Mcmahon and him all went to a bar later that night and just got

1757
01:43:24.781 --> 01:43:26.470
wasted.
And then,
uh,

1758
01:43:26.490 --> 01:43:29.740
I guess Johnny Carson took a girl home that night from the bar who?

1759
01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:32.430
Johnny Carson.
Johnny Carson.
So yeah,
I don't know,
man,

1760
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:35.370
that sounds like a lot of gossipy nonsense.

1761
01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:37.860
May or may or not have happened type shit.

1762
01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:41.400
But the guy obviously lived in a different era,
you know,

1763
01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:46.560
famous before him being that famous on TV didn't exist and that sort of

1764
01:43:46.561 --> 01:43:48.590
intimacy,
what I was going to point out.
You're right,
you're right.

1765
01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:52.040
Is it that intimacy of being in front of the camera every night like that for

1766
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:56.090
decades is incredibly unusual.
Yeah.
And so like everywhere he went,

1767
01:43:56.091 --> 01:43:59.000
I guarantee you people just wanted to be around him and thought that he was a

1768
01:43:59.001 --> 01:43:59.721
part of their family.

1769
01:43:59.721 --> 01:44:02.990
Like you're wanting to talk to him and grab him and he's probably like,

1770
01:44:02.991 --> 01:44:05.690
leave me the fuck alone.
Sure.
You know Jesus Christ.

1771
01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:07.160
And so that's probably when he went home,

1772
01:44:07.161 --> 01:44:10.490
he probably had nothing left for his wife and kids.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah.

1773
01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:13.070
Might might've married a cunt and his kids might've been shitheads.
I mean,

1774
01:44:13.071 --> 01:44:16.660
I don't know what the fuck happened.
I lost a lot of money.
Yeah,
yeah,

1775
01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:18.350
I lost a lot.
Don't put that up front.

1776
01:44:18.450 --> 01:44:22.490
And a few white guy list lost a lot of fucking money.
Big Time.

1777
01:44:23.630 --> 01:44:24.321
Nine figures.

1778
01:44:24.321 --> 01:44:28.550
I think divorce was one of the things that Eddie Murphy talked about on stage

1779
01:44:28.551 --> 01:44:29.120
and raw.

1780
01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:34.120
Remember that his divorce was so bad that Eddie Murphy talked about it on stage.

1781
01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:40.430
You know,
he took some hits,
you know?

1782
01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:45.020
And who knows?
Who knows what kind of a woman he married?
Who knows?

1783
01:44:45.050 --> 01:44:49.730
She might have been a sweetheart.
I don't know.
I who knows.
Yeah.

1784
01:44:49.731 --> 01:44:54.260
We only went on vacation once and dad ignored us and you're like,
oh my God,

1785
01:44:54.690 --> 01:44:59.120
here you think,
oh,
he must be so great.
Johnny Carson's your dad and you know,

1786
01:44:59.121 --> 01:45:01.770
you just think,
I dunno.
I like

1787
01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:07.250
one of the weirdest things.
Must be like be the son of a movie star.
Yeah,
right.

1788
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:09.830
Especially back in those days.
Oh yeah.
I don't know.

1789
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:12.800
Like I saw something about Steve McQueen were honoring Steve Mcqueen.

1790
01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:16.340
Steve McQueen son and Steve McQueen sons weren't sunglasses.

1791
01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:19.040
They're interviewing him.
He's wearing sunglasses and he's inside,

1792
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:22.490
which is always like,
what are you doing the fuck are you doing like you,

1793
01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:25.280
unless you have a medical condition,
one of their sunglasses on.

1794
01:45:25.290 --> 01:45:28.910
It was just weird.
You know?
No matter how big a star you are too,

1795
01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:34.460
right?
Yeah,
they can.
They just can't.

1796
01:45:34.461 --> 01:45:36.080
I don't know why purple and orange.

1797
01:45:37.210 --> 01:45:39.580
Well they can definitely pull off wearing sunglasses.
Yeah.

1798
01:45:42.290 --> 01:45:45.290
Why?
Why can they do it?
I don't know.
I was saying,

1799
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:47.150
I was just saying they're so strong.
They're so physically

1800
01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:55.490
Tommy.
That's actually quite racist to say that.
Yes.
Even though it's true,

1801
01:45:55.610 --> 01:45:58.790
I support it 100%.
The foreign,
I back my thought on that.

1802
01:45:59.510 --> 01:46:02.450
Like it's also racist implied.
They have big dicks.
It's also racist.

1803
01:46:02.451 --> 01:46:04.630
Imply that they like chicken and watermelon.
Yeah.

1804
01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:08.150
That's kind of fucked up cause both chicken and watermelon are delicious and

1805
01:46:08.151 --> 01:46:09.890
having a big Dick as a good thing.
Awesome.

1806
01:46:09.891 --> 01:46:12.350
And so it's been really good at sports and physically strong.

1807
01:46:12.530 --> 01:46:14.060
So why is it that it's a problem?

1808
01:46:14.210 --> 01:46:16.970
I think the people that really take issue with that are always take,

1809
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:21.800
they're taking issue with the fact that the implication that and that with some

1810
01:46:21.801 --> 01:46:26.090
people are getting from that is that that's the only thing that somebody black

1811
01:46:26.150 --> 01:46:30.700
is good at or something that you can be impressed with is that there,
you know,

1812
01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:35.030
the great entertainer or the big Dick guy or they jumped fucking through the

1813
01:46:35.031 --> 01:46:38.650
roof and you go,
no,
that's not true.
That's,

1814
01:46:38.651 --> 01:46:40.520
I'm not saying it's the only thing I'm saying.

1815
01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:44.720
That's what I enjoy the most about those black guys is that that guy can show it

1816
01:46:44.730 --> 01:46:48.610
through the fucking writes the most about,
I'm sure.
Well this is what do I,

1817
01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:50.520
what am I getting out of fucking Lebron James?

1818
01:46:50.610 --> 01:46:55.410
<v 2>How much of the,
um,
how much of reality was there to a Jimmy Greek,</v>

1819
01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:59.100
Jimmy the Greek got in trouble with saying,
there's,
here's the,
here's the thing,

1820
01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:02.250
my argument on that.
What did he say?
Let's tell people what he said.
Jimmy,

1821
01:47:02.251 --> 01:47:05.790
the Greek was calling a game and he said,

1822
01:47:06.270 --> 01:47:11.220
I think the actual quote was,
look at that little monkey go.
And of course,
I mean,

1823
01:47:11.250 --> 01:47:14.880
you said it and you're like,
that is unacceptable.
But there was basically,

1824
01:47:14.881 --> 01:47:18.810
people will pull it up,
pull it up.
Jimmy,
the Greek comments that got him fired.

1825
01:47:18.811 --> 01:47:22.530
It's on youtube.
Yeah,
it's uh,
apparently,
uh,
all he's dead.

1826
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:27.750
What year did this take place?
This had to have been,
I want to say 1988.

1827
01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:31.650
I thought it was earlier.
I thought it was early.
It was an 88.
Yeah.
1988.

1828
01:47:31.651 --> 01:47:35.310
And embarrass cvs fire,
the contrite Jimmy,
the Greek.

1829
01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:40.870
<v 8>What was asking questions about Martin Luther King's birthday and the progress</v>

1830
01:47:40.871 --> 01:47:44.860
blacks have made in societies?
CBS sports commentator Jimmy,

1831
01:47:44.861 --> 01:47:48.640
the Greek Snyder gave his impressions of blacks and coaching in the national

1832
01:47:48.641 --> 01:47:49.474
football league.

1833
01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:54.340
His answers could raise as much controversy as well as date things by former

1834
01:47:54.341 --> 01:47:59.080
Dodgers executive al Campanis last April on ABC's Nightline news program.

1835
01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:04.200
<v 9>Yeah,
I'm pretty sure they're going to have to equalize it for the blacks,
Greeks,</v>

1836
01:48:04.201 --> 01:48:07.200
the Jews,
and for everybody.
I mean,
let's make it equal for everybody.

1837
01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:12.900
And is it equal or what about the sports?
Well,
they've got everything.

1838
01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:16.470
If they take over coaching like everybody wants him to,

1839
01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:19.380
there's not going to be anything left for the white people.
I mean,

1840
01:48:19.381 --> 01:48:20.790
all the players are black.
I mean,

1841
01:48:20.791 --> 01:48:23.400
the only thing that the whites control is the coaching jobs.

1842
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:27.140
I'm not being derogatory about it,
but that's all that's left there.

1843
01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:30.990
So black talent is beautiful.
It's great.
It's out there.
It's,
you know,

1844
01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:35.190
the only thing left for the whites is a couple of coaching job and we need to

1845
01:48:35.191 --> 01:48:37.800
get more black coaches.
I'm sure.
Right.
With me,

1846
01:48:38.130 --> 01:48:40.290
I'm sure that they'll take over that pretty soon too.

1847
01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:44.110
<v 2>It,
there's nothing wrong with that that I'm talking about his end game comment.</v>

1848
01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:48.100
Isn't there a,
there's a common,
he got fired for that?
No,
no,
no.

1849
01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.850
This doesn't seem right.
I think there's another video.
There's an end game.

1850
01:48:52.150 --> 01:48:55.600
He's calling a game and there's a guy,
I don't know.

1851
01:48:57.610 --> 01:48:58.470
That's what I thought was,

1852
01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:02.110
he was saying something about their butts being higher and their legs.

1853
01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:04.390
Me being longer.

1854
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:08.410
Remember that I actually know I for me,
I,
you know,

1855
01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:09.880
I don't remember it happening.

1856
01:49:09.881 --> 01:49:12.970
I remember learning about it and I thought it was the,

1857
01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:16.180
in the game comment that got him the most in trouble.

1858
01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:20.560
I mean obviously he could have gotten in trouble obviously for what he said

1859
01:49:20.561 --> 01:49:23.410
there,
but why would he get in trouble for what he said there?
Well,

1860
01:49:23.411 --> 01:49:24.760
I think the implication,

1861
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:29.960
<v 8>it's not going to do it on Friday afternoon here in Washington.</v>

1862
01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:35.220
<v 2>Musburger his commentary on him getting fired.
That's not it.
Okay.
Um,</v>

1863
01:49:35.790 --> 01:49:39.150
because well what that implies,

1864
01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:42.090
that's kind of like attached to the idea that like black guys couldn't be

1865
01:49:42.091 --> 01:49:45.660
quarterbacks.
Like they could play every other block.
He didn't say that though.

1866
01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:48.430
No,
no,
no.
I'm saying,
but the,
it's,
it's I think connected

1867
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:50.500
<v 4>to the same point of view,</v>

1868
01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:54.850
which was that quarterbacks had to be smart and then coaching is,

1869
01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:56.130
is thought of as the total.

1870
01:49:56.530 --> 01:49:57.490
<v 2>That's not what he's saying now.</v>

1871
01:49:57.491 --> 01:50:00.160
He was saying the black guys are taking over every spot.

1872
01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:03.640
They were saying that black eyes are going to be every player and they're

1873
01:50:03.641 --> 01:50:05.450
veteran coach over coaching too.
Right.

1874
01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:07.780
It said they were eventually going to take over coaching too.

1875
01:50:08.050 --> 01:50:10.900
Like he's very specific,
but,
and if they did,

1876
01:50:10.901 --> 01:50:14.170
there'd be nothing left for the whites to yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
he's being honest.

1877
01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:17.290
I mean,
look,
it's not saying that white guys can't do it,

1878
01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:20.890
but he's saying that the majority of the people,
hey guys,

1879
01:50:21.250 --> 01:50:25.120
the majority of the people are going to be black.
That's what he's saying.

1880
01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:28.140
That they're dominating.
He's right.
He is right there.

1881
01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:31.870
How is that a controversial pubs?
They also said during the slave period,

1882
01:50:31.871 --> 01:50:34.990
the slave would breed the big black.
That's not that time.

1883
01:50:35.230 --> 01:50:38.500
But what I'm saying is that time right there,
nothing he said was controversial.

1884
01:50:38.501 --> 01:50:40.960
That was the thing that was controversial.

1885
01:50:40.961 --> 01:50:43.150
And that's what I was going to ask you about when I said,

1886
01:50:43.690 --> 01:50:48.690
do you think that what he said has merit that they bred people to be the largest

1887
01:50:49.901 --> 01:50:52.930
slaves?
Definitely.
They definitely did that.
Yes.
And I think proven,

1888
01:50:53.050 --> 01:50:58.050
<v 4>I th I think that that definitely happened and I think you definitely see um,</v>

1889
01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:03.770
the like results of that in today's population in some way.

1890
01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:04.340
There's,

1891
01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:09.340
there's no way you can look at some of the African American,

1892
01:51:09.981 --> 01:51:14.981
the black population and not actually think that there's some validity to like

1893
01:51:15.771 --> 01:51:19.130
super breeding having taken place.
Like there's,

1894
01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:24.220
I think there's a disproportionate amount of unbelievably athletic,

1895
01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:27.800
huge black athletes.

1896
01:51:28.410 --> 01:51:30.080
You think the agents were bred small then,

1897
01:51:31.570 --> 01:51:33.450
but it were proportioner.

1898
01:51:33.710 --> 01:51:38.450
It's disproportionate England and that's a population that's been bred in,
in,
in,

1899
01:51:38.451 --> 01:51:39.284
in,
in,
in,

1900
01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:44.770
<v 2>yeah.
Well what they know for a fact.
Yeah.
Well that's also the weather.</v>

1901
01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:47.320
They're dealing with the pasty because there's no sun.

1902
01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:52.300
They'd been there for thousands of years and that's a really involved situation.

1903
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:55.180
They,
those people have been there a long ass time

1904
01:51:55.730 --> 01:51:59.630
<v 4>problem with the that slavery thing like are saying that,
you know,</v>

1905
01:51:59.631 --> 01:52:04.610
slaves created great athletes is that white people said it before and it was

1906
01:52:04.611 --> 01:52:07.400
always a problem.
But then in,
in recent years,

1907
01:52:07.401 --> 01:52:09.830
and I think the last person to say it was Michael Johnson,

1908
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:14.690
less prominent black guy to say it,
our former Olympic gold medalist,
he was like,

1909
01:52:14.691 --> 01:52:19.310
yeah,
absolutely.
That's a valid point of view to take.

1910
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:23.450
Yeah.
That we have some super athletic gene in some of us.

1911
01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:28.310
<v 2>Yeah.
Well if you were going to own slaves to,
it only makes sense.</v>

1912
01:52:28.311 --> 01:52:29.690
People who own dogs do that.

1913
01:52:30.010 --> 01:52:34.040
People who own roosters route fighting roosters,
they do that too.

1914
01:52:34.041 --> 01:52:36.310
They did the best with the best.
You can do anything.

1915
01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:38.140
<v 4>Yeah.
You can't look at it from like a,</v>

1916
01:52:38.170 --> 01:52:42.460
whether it's a humanitarian or politically correct to say you look at it like,

1917
01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:47.090
well imagine you're trying to get production out of humans and you're,
you know,

1918
01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:50.480
you see one that's really built and strong and you see another and you go,

1919
01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:53.780
you too.
You're going to make kids.
Yeah,
sure.

1920
01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:57.860
And why wouldn't those genes then be passed on for generations?
Yeah,
for sure.

1921
01:52:57.950 --> 01:53:00.650
I mean,
it seems like it makes sense to me.
I don't have proof of it,

1922
01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:01.590
but to me too,

1923
01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:04.210
<v 0>Gene's myth must die.</v>

1924
01:53:04.211 --> 01:53:09.160
Michael Johnson links African American sprinters to slavery and revisits a

1925
01:53:09.161 --> 01:53:13.600
particularly ugly pseudoscience.
Um,

1926
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:17.080
but why is,
why is that so articulately ugly?
As a historian,

1927
01:53:17.170 --> 01:53:20.110
I find to be stunning about what he said.

1928
01:53:20.111 --> 01:53:24.160
The claim of supremacy of black athletes in track had never seen,

1929
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:25.820
<v 10>okay.</v>

1930
01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:29.090
<v 0>Had never been discussed openly before.
Actually with his words,</v>

1931
01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:32.090
Johnson plunged himself into a century old debate.

1932
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:36.110
It seems to rear its rather ugly head every four years.
Not Ugly.

1933
01:53:36.170 --> 01:53:39.080
Just in time for the opening of the sports largest global stage,

1934
01:53:39.081 --> 01:53:43.310
Johnson supported his theory with the examples of men's a hundred millimeter

1935
01:53:43.311 --> 01:53:46.850
finals in the Beijing Olympics.
Three of the eight finalists came from Jamaica,

1936
01:53:46.851 --> 01:53:50.210
including a record breaker.
When are you saying bolt?
Two from Trinidad,

1937
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:51.170
African-americans,

1938
01:53:51.170 --> 01:53:56.170
Walter Dick's and doc Patton and Dutch Sprinter Turon De Martina who hails from

1939
01:53:57.051 --> 01:54:00.200
cure Curacao rounded out the line.

1940
01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:04.760
Racial assumptions don't work easily as simply noting that four years ago,

1941
01:54:04.761 --> 01:54:08.480
all eight finalists in the quest to be the world's fastest men likely had

1942
01:54:08.481 --> 01:54:12.740
ancestors who were slaves because race is,
well never simple.

1943
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:13.790
What the fuck is that?

1944
01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:18.940
But rather works as an embryonic amoebic amoebic identity formation that chink

1945
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:23.970
changes throughout history.
It's a social construction,

1946
01:54:23.971 --> 01:54:28.740
deeply entangled with the definitions of class,
gender,
sexuality and so on.

1947
01:54:29.010 --> 01:54:33.000
This guy,
whoever wrote this is an intellectual Dodo.
Oh,
it's a woman.

1948
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:35.340
It's a woman.
That's a Dodo statement.

1949
01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:38.340
That's a statement where you're just not being honest about something and you're

1950
01:54:38.341 --> 01:54:40.150
trying to be massively politically correct.

1951
01:54:40.170 --> 01:54:42.660
[inaudible] spite of the preponderance of information

1952
01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:45.660
<v 4>and you don't follow sports.
If you wrote that,
you don't follow it,</v>

1953
01:54:45.661 --> 01:54:47.690
you don't know what's going on in major sports.

1954
01:54:47.710 --> 01:54:50.520
You think it's a black woman or a white woman who wrote that white woman?
Yeah,

1955
01:54:51.110 --> 01:54:54.540
I think so.
Seems Wyclef political.
Incorrect.
Yes.

1956
01:54:54.570 --> 01:54:58.200
Just like the white women that gets offended at every for it.
For everybody else.

1957
01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:02.400
The show?
Yeah.
Oh,
the righteous and what you said,

1958
01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:07.170
isn't that fascinating?
Yes.
They'll say that to you about like whatever.

1959
01:55:07.171 --> 01:55:10.910
It could be a Mexican thing.
We got a worse,
of course it is liberal.
Nope.

1960
01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:12.480
Let's say that about the Mexican drug lord,

1961
01:55:12.630 --> 01:55:15.870
and there'll be a Mexican guy like high fiving unit about,
he's like,

1962
01:55:15.871 --> 01:55:18.590
that's just true.
And she's like,
that is not acceptable.
No.

1963
01:55:18.610 --> 01:55:22.400
Like white people are the racial police for everybody else.
Right.
You know?
Yeah.

1964
01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:26.610
<v 0>Well there's a lot of white,
I mean,
white guilt is as real as fuck.</v>

1965
01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:27.700
Yes it did.

1966
01:55:27.710 --> 01:55:32.710
The white guilt is so real and totally the need to get Brownie points from black

1967
01:55:32.731 --> 01:55:33.680
people.
It's so cute.

1968
01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:38.940
<v 4>Other fellow progressives,
and I want to say w two what I totally,</v>

1969
01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:41.250
I love black approval.
Like when a black person,

1970
01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:44.040
Tom and I always talk about good will you feel

1971
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:46.440
<v 0>when like a black person,
it's like you're really funny.
Like,
Oh my God,</v>

1972
01:55:46.441 --> 01:55:49.430
I'm really fun.
Yeah,
but that's not meaning that you,
oh my God.

1973
01:55:49.431 --> 01:55:53.090
Distort reality in a form of journalism to try to like,
you know,

1974
01:55:53.310 --> 01:55:56.340
like what that woman said in that article.
Like the way she's saying it.

1975
01:55:56.341 --> 01:55:59.010
It's like that's such a nonsense statement.

1976
01:55:59.190 --> 01:56:03.600
I'm not sure I even understand anything.
I don't even want to rear its ugly head.

1977
01:56:03.601 --> 01:56:08.580
First of all saying someone because of slavery is fucking awesome.
Athletics.

1978
01:56:08.850 --> 01:56:13.830
Last time I checked being awesome and athletics is really good and there have

1979
01:56:13.831 --> 01:56:16.320
been for sure some horrible things that have had like,

1980
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:21.270
like for instance by people.
So sallians if you look at that whole movie,

1981
01:56:21.271 --> 01:56:22.020
True Romance,

1982
01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:26.370
I mean that was the whole scene where Christopher Walken and uh,

1983
01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:31.340
what the fuck is his name?
Uh,
the dad,
goddammit,
I know the Daddy.

1984
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:35.410
He goes,
your gray,
gray grand.
Easy rider.
Yes.

1985
01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:39.510
Whose name was Dennis Hopper.
Dennis Hopper.
Dennis Hopper.

1986
01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:44.640
That whole eggplant discussion.
It's true.
The more raped all the people.

1987
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:47.730
What's this why my people are savages.
It's where they have dark hair.

1988
01:56:47.731 --> 01:56:52.731
That's the people's inability to grasp reality and the brutality of shit that's

1989
01:56:54.691 --> 01:56:58.080
actually happened.
It's because it's associated with something ugly.

1990
01:56:58.230 --> 01:57:03.000
Slavery was an ugly practice for sure.
People are so terrified of it,
right?

1991
01:57:03.090 --> 01:57:04.890
People connecting something awesome,

1992
01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:09.910
but coming from something ugly with being a part of that ugly thing and that be

1993
01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:14.630
accusing someone of being awesome because of that somehow or another diminishes

1994
01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:15.473
their accomplishments.

1995
01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:18.870
But scientifically and statistically when you're looking at,
again,

1996
01:57:19.050 --> 01:57:21.900
one 10th of the population is black,

1997
01:57:22.110 --> 01:57:26.480
but 90% of the sprinters are black.
I mean maybe more,
maybe more.

1998
01:57:26.710 --> 01:57:30.210
That's one where they just completely dominate.
How many,

1999
01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:34.410
how about football players?
The football is probably like 65 to 70%.

2000
01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:36.390
That's pretty high.
And basketball,

2001
01:57:37.170 --> 01:57:40.890
basketball was probably 85 to 90% boxing.
Boxing is like,

2002
01:57:40.891 --> 01:57:44.620
there's Mexicans and there's a few Filipino Russia's couple of Russians.

2003
01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:47.970
It was scattered white guy that fucking didn't have a good dad.
Yeah.

2004
01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:52.330
Other than that,
yeah,
it's a lot of black people.
I mean it's,

2005
01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:55.590
it's a really dumb thing to pretend that that's not the case.

2006
01:57:55.620 --> 01:57:58.260
Black people in the United States have stopped playing.

2007
01:57:58.430 --> 01:58:02.310
There's a lot less interest in,
in the black culture for playing baseball,

2008
01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:05.280
but not in Latin America.
And guess what?

2009
01:58:05.610 --> 01:58:07.920
Fucking black Latinos,

2010
01:58:08.730 --> 01:58:12.900
incredibly dominant baseball players.
Cause that's the major sports soccer.

2011
01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:17.490
And when you look at black of ton of black people that are Brazilian bitch.

2012
01:58:17.550 --> 01:58:21.240
Oh my God.
Come on son.
Dominic shit about MMA fighters from Brazil.

2013
01:58:21.241 --> 01:58:25.590
There's a shit load of black MMA fighters from Brazil.
Yup.
Excellent.

2014
01:58:25.710 --> 01:58:29.460
Even golf.
Yeah.
There's that one.
That one goes pretty good.

2015
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:33.130
Dominates that whole thing.
One guy not doing so good anymore.
Yeah.

2016
01:58:33.190 --> 01:58:36.570
He's not as bad.
He's still,
he's still just got crushed by the media.

2017
01:58:36.690 --> 01:58:39.630
He's still practice confidence so bad.

2018
01:58:40.050 --> 01:58:42.790
We were just talking about the best house like crazy.

2019
01:58:42.791 --> 01:58:46.180
That scandal was I did because at the time I was a writer on Chelsea lately,

2020
01:58:46.181 --> 01:58:49.120
so it was a windfall.
Yeah.
I was like man,

2021
01:58:49.330 --> 01:58:52.720
from the whenever tabloid gods,

2022
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:55.120
but it was so crazy that the guy,

2023
01:58:55.150 --> 01:58:58.780
the nerdy golf player was pulling so much pussy.

2024
01:59:00.490 --> 01:59:02.370
Yes,
probably.
I think they're men

2025
01:59:04.050 --> 01:59:08.060
while they're rich.
Famous.
Yeah.

2026
01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:09.760
Those guys are so baller.

2027
01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:13.060
The amount of money that those big time pro golfers make,

2028
01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:17.950
even a person that is doing well can't relate to the amount of money that tiger

2029
01:59:17.951 --> 01:59:18.784
woods,
his made.

2030
01:59:19.330 --> 01:59:23.680
Tiger Woods is like made $1 billion off knocking a ball into a hole in the dirt.

2031
01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:27.850
Like I don't think anybody can ever understand the appeal of $1 million on a

2032
01:59:27.851 --> 01:59:29.880
bimbo.
Yeah.
You know,

2033
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:34.120
a billion off the charts off the charts.

2034
01:59:34.270 --> 01:59:38.380
A guy who makes billions knocking ball and just likes to slink Dick.

2035
01:59:38.740 --> 01:59:41.530
That's so great.
Yeah.
The way I described it,

2036
01:59:41.860 --> 01:59:45.370
I said that he looked like a really unfortunate looking,

2037
01:59:45.371 --> 01:59:49.750
but wildly successful man who was attacked by sluts.
If he,

2038
01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:55.420
well,
that's for fleas.
He would need a color and I'm so much shaming by.
No,
no,

2039
01:59:56.020 --> 01:59:59.110
no.
But just they should just be able to do whatever they want to do.

2040
01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:03.100
But just as a story,
it's a bad word.
Made me take it away.

2041
02:00:05.710 --> 02:00:09.610
Free Girl.
I feel like post to it.

2042
02:00:09.670 --> 02:00:13.750
I don't like it as a woman,
I,
I want,
I want us to be better.

2043
02:00:13.810 --> 02:00:16.300
I'd like us to be contributors to our society.

2044
02:00:16.301 --> 02:00:20.980
I like us to win Nobel prizes and not take rich guys money for sex.

2045
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:23.050
I just mean for sure.

2046
02:00:23.051 --> 02:00:25.720
There's a lot of men out there that have taken someone's money too.

2047
02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:27.430
There's gold diggers that are men.

2048
02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:31.150
I know gold diggers that are men that have wives that are rich and famous.

2049
02:00:31.151 --> 02:00:35.120
They don't do shit.
Not famous rather,
but rich and successful,
I should say.
Yeah,

2050
02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:39.250
here's disproportionate,
but weak people,
weak people.
Everywhere you go,

2051
02:00:39.251 --> 02:00:41.350
there's always someone who wants someone to take care of them.

2052
02:00:41.351 --> 02:00:46.351
This sons of rich men are oftentimes just as bad as a gold digger,

2053
02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:51.700
like having no desire to achieve or perform anything,

2054
02:00:51.701 --> 02:00:54.550
a delusional perception of reality.
You know,

2055
02:00:54.551 --> 02:00:57.790
a delusional idea of what their own value is because they don't really

2056
02:00:57.791 --> 02:01:01.840
contribute.
They just were given a free ride,
so they never developed a character.

2057
02:01:02.050 --> 02:01:03.700
Unbelievably privileged,

2058
02:01:03.701 --> 02:01:07.360
like an really nice free ride where they feel very entitled to everything.

2059
02:01:07.390 --> 02:01:08.640
How much,
like when I said,

2060
02:01:08.650 --> 02:01:12.460
you know that you can't ever say that comics can't have a successful

2061
02:01:12.490 --> 02:01:16.900
relationship because you guys can do it.
You can never say that.
You just,

2062
02:01:16.930 --> 02:01:18.160
you can't say that.

2063
02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:23.740
There's always going to be a group of people at any gender,

2064
02:01:23.770 --> 02:01:26.130
whether it's transgender,
whether it's gay.

2065
02:01:26.131 --> 02:01:28.030
There's always going to be a group of people that just fail.

2066
02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:30.060
There's going to be a group of women that fail.

2067
02:01:30.061 --> 02:01:32.740
A group of men that fail is going to be people that just don't get their shit

2068
02:01:32.741 --> 02:01:36.880
together.
Don't ever self actualize,
don't ever pursue their dreams,

2069
02:01:36.881 --> 02:01:40.100
don't ever get involved in anything they truly love.
It's going to happen.

2070
02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:41.870
But there's always gonna be people that do.

2071
02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:45.920
They're always have bins from Amelia Earhart to,
you know,
fill in the blank.

2072
02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:47.390
All throughout history,

2073
02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:50.930
there's always been women that have figured out a way to achieve and,

2074
02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:54.440
and do things that they really,
truly enjoy doing.
Like our flight attendant

2075
02:01:59.410 --> 02:02:00.740
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

2076
02:02:01.150 --> 02:02:05.230
<v 0>we are hijacked for the longest time I've ever been hijacked as an adult.</v>

2077
02:02:06.090 --> 02:02:07.070
<v 4>Oh No.</v>

2078
02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:10.780
<v 0>Tommy and I were having a fun little conversation and a,</v>

2079
02:02:10.830 --> 02:02:13.140
we ordered a little glass of wine because were gentlemen,

2080
02:02:13.141 --> 02:02:14.670
and we're on a business trip.

2081
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:17.680
We decided to have a little wine and we're sitting there,
uh,

2082
02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:22.260
and the woman came over and she made a joke about the temperature of the wine

2083
02:02:22.530 --> 02:02:27.300
and I made the mistake of going,
um,
is it like you're apologizing?
It's too cold.

2084
02:02:27.301 --> 02:02:30.240
That's funny.
I've never heard anybody apologize of wine.
It's too cold.
She goes,

2085
02:02:30.241 --> 02:02:32.430
Huh.
Well,
if you remember the scene from sideways.
He,

2086
02:02:32.431 --> 02:02:35.820
I've never really been much into one.
The only time I drink wine is in church,

2087
02:02:35.821 --> 02:02:38.160
but there's a funny thing about wine.

2088
02:02:38.161 --> 02:02:43.080
I knew a guy and the guy was a wine connoisseur and they brought him a bottle of

2089
02:02:43.081 --> 02:02:46.160
wine and said,
should we put this in the refrigerator?
You script,

2090
02:02:46.161 --> 02:02:48.330
don't you touch it and put it in the refrigerator.

2091
02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:50.900
Don't you put a hand on that wine and bringing in voice.

2092
02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:53.490
I thought it was so funny,
but of course I don't drink.

2093
02:02:53.491 --> 02:02:58.491
The only time I drink it a drunk and he went on and on and on.

2094
02:03:00.660 --> 02:03:03.840
Yes,
to the point where I was lucky because I was in the window,

2095
02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:05.250
so I just abandoned Tommy.

2096
02:03:05.370 --> 02:03:10.370
I lifted up the window and I put my face to the glass and I reached into my

2097
02:03:12.601 --> 02:03:14.130
laptop bag,
but I put it up,

2098
02:03:14.131 --> 02:03:18.120
pulled out my notepad and I started writing down and I wrote in my note pad.

2099
02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:22.360
That flight attendant won't shut the fuck up.
I wrote that in my,
nope.

2100
02:03:22.610 --> 02:03:26.990
<v 4>I started writing it in front of her too.
Yes.
Well,
first of all,</v>

2101
02:03:26.991 --> 02:03:30.500
she came out when she came over,
she goes,
do you want something to drink?
I said,

2102
02:03:30.501 --> 02:03:32.120
yeah,
um,
do you have peanut and war?

2103
02:03:32.150 --> 02:03:34.570
Which is not that crazy to say because sometimes they go,
no,

2104
02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:38.430
we have cab won't shut the fuck up.
Yeah.

2105
02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:44.000
She just has to be addressed.
When I said,
do you have he know in war?
She goes,

2106
02:03:44.001 --> 02:03:48.650
uh,
excuse me.
And I go,
Pinot Noir.
She goes,
do you think you're in Leone,

2107
02:03:48.651 --> 02:03:52.970
France?
And I was like,
no,
it's not.
Yeah,
it's not crazy.

2108
02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:56.450
And she was like,
we got red or white.
And I was like,
all right,
red.

2109
02:03:56.930 --> 02:04:01.370
And then when she came back,
it was sideways.

2110
02:04:01.460 --> 02:04:05.720
It was the so Monet at Macy's who when I worked at the hospital,

2111
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:08.230
they brought him the wine and he said,
should I chill this?

2112
02:04:10.330 --> 02:04:12.240
We're talking about the most like

2113
02:04:12.650 --> 02:04:17.420
<v 0>boring sentences.
Oh yeah.
These were,
these were incredibly boring sentences.</v>

2114
02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:21.120
<v 4>It's the worst.
Oh God.
When she left,</v>

2115
02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:25.890
when she left and we go like,
what the fuck was that?
She left,

2116
02:04:26.430 --> 02:04:30.690
she came back and I just made,
I like,
I just looked up.
She goes,

2117
02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:31.531
do you ever see the movie?

2118
02:04:31.531 --> 02:04:36.300
Simon was like [inaudible] she was like my favorite scene and that has a wine

2119
02:04:36.301 --> 02:04:37.620
scene.
And I was like,

2120
02:04:38.110 --> 02:04:40.470
<v 2>all right.
She goes and I,
this is when I zoned out.</v>

2121
02:04:40.471 --> 02:04:44.360
She's like Bruce Willis and whatever.
And she was like,
it ain't not all right.

2122
02:04:44.370 --> 02:04:47.550
All the wine fall I know was a great scene.
And I was like,
she wouldn't stop.

2123
02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:50.490
And you know what's really fascinating before this happened,

2124
02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:51.540
before this happened,

2125
02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:56.780
Tommy nailed her personality cause we may or may not have had

2126
02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:02.310
before we got on that plane.
And so we were uh,

2127
02:05:02.311 --> 02:05:05.880
it was just starting to kick in and mid flight and he goes,
you know,

2128
02:05:05.881 --> 02:05:06.714
when I think,

2129
02:05:06.780 --> 02:05:10.770
I think that they put her on this small plane because she can't work well with

2130
02:05:10.771 --> 02:05:14.220
others and that the other students is don't like working with her.

2131
02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:16.770
So they stick her on these small planes cause she doesn't,

2132
02:05:16.771 --> 02:05:17.970
she doesn't want to be around anybody.

2133
02:05:17.971 --> 02:05:20.880
She's probably been doing this a long time and they know she doesn't work well

2134
02:05:20.881 --> 02:05:21.714
with others.

2135
02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:26.250
And then she came over and just right away gave us the ferocious ear beading,

2136
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:31.590
right?
Yes.
It was an ear beating was also,

2137
02:05:31.591 --> 02:05:33.180
she gave us an ear beating on church,

2138
02:05:33.210 --> 02:05:36.630
shutting off the phones to like everything else up her phone,

2139
02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:39.300
pressing this button and we didn't have our phones on.

2140
02:05:39.301 --> 02:05:41.280
It's not like we were resisting,
we shut our phones off,

2141
02:05:41.281 --> 02:05:45.500
but she did it for the whole thing.
Like this is what I want you to do,
right?

2142
02:05:45.570 --> 02:05:50.040
You see this button,
I want you to press this button,
not in airplane mode folks,

2143
02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:53.190
not in airplane mode.
I want you to shut this button.
If you have an iPhone,

2144
02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:56.250
I want you to slide that over the to shut it off.

2145
02:05:56.400 --> 02:06:00.570
And I mean she's going on and on and on it taking a long ass time.

2146
02:06:00.930 --> 02:06:03.630
And if you wanted to read a book or if you wanted to,
you know,

2147
02:06:03.631 --> 02:06:06.780
listen to your Ipod,
eh,
that's not happening.
No,

2148
02:06:06.781 --> 02:06:11.340
you're dealing with this nonsense you're dealing with and you can't even fight

2149
02:06:11.370 --> 02:06:14.280
against that nonsense because if you argue at all about anything,

2150
02:06:14.281 --> 02:06:16.710
they kick you off the plane.
Yep.
She's got the Passover.

2151
02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:19.770
I had a friend that kicked off the plane because he was upset that they didn't

2152
02:06:19.771 --> 02:06:22.110
find a seat for his son next to him.

2153
02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:24.540
Like they didn't find anybody that was willing to move.

2154
02:06:24.750 --> 02:06:27.360
It was an hour and a half flight from San Francisco to Seattle.

2155
02:06:27.361 --> 02:06:31.590
It's a quick ass flight and they,
you know,
he said,
is there,
is it possible?

2156
02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:34.650
She was like,
sir,
we've tried.
There's nothing we can do.
He goes,

2157
02:06:34.651 --> 02:06:37.920
I have a five year old though.
Like,
why did you guys sell me a ticket?

2158
02:06:37.921 --> 02:06:41.190
I told you it was five years old.
You can't have a five year old sit by himself.

2159
02:06:41.191 --> 02:06:44.970
He's,
he's terrified of flying in the first place.
Like all I'm asking is someone,

2160
02:06:44.971 --> 02:06:49.800
if you ask if someone could switch seats,
and she said,
sir,
I've tried.

2161
02:06:49.801 --> 02:06:52.740
There's nothing we can do.
Please take your seat.
And he was like,

2162
02:06:52.741 --> 02:06:56.730
you guys are the most unfathomably friendly airline.
Like you guys are horrible.

2163
02:06:56.731 --> 02:06:58.620
I can't believe you're doing this.
So that's all he says.

2164
02:06:58.770 --> 02:07:02.220
He goes and sits down and the fucking captain comes up to him,
said,
sir,

2165
02:07:02.221 --> 02:07:03.330
are you going to have to come off the same?

2166
02:07:03.370 --> 02:07:07.710
They say you're aggressive and you're,
he was like,
what?
He goes,
you've got to be,

2167
02:07:07.711 --> 02:07:11.520
you must be joking.
He goes,
all I asked is if they could find a seat for my son.

2168
02:07:11.521 --> 02:07:14.580
I didn't use profanity.
I didn't raise my voice.
I said,

2169
02:07:14.610 --> 02:07:18.600
you guys are the most unfairly friendly airline that I've ever seen.

2170
02:07:18.930 --> 02:07:22.050
That's all I said,
because you weren't even willing to like look for someone.

2171
02:07:22.110 --> 02:07:25.260
And they kicked him off the plane and he was like,
I can't believe this.
He goes,

2172
02:07:25.261 --> 02:07:29.250
I'm not aggressive.
But we saw that was it.
You and I that saw that?

2173
02:07:29.790 --> 02:07:34.290
Who did we see?
We on a plane,
we saw two guys arguing about the,
the bin.

2174
02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:36.040
Um,

2175
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:38.980
<v 4>I dunno with me on that one.
I don't think I've seen two people kicked out.</v>

2176
02:07:38.981 --> 02:07:43.190
It might've been Ari.
I've seen a lady to get kicked off or having attitude,
um,

2177
02:07:43.220 --> 02:07:45.160
about like her whole day.
And she was like,

2178
02:07:45.161 --> 02:07:46.450
and then you put me later on this shit.

2179
02:07:46.690 --> 02:07:49.060
And now me and him talking about it and she was just complaining,
complaining,

2180
02:07:49.061 --> 02:07:53.680
complaining,
and you know,
she was I think aggressive speaking to them.
Boom,
boom.

2181
02:07:53.740 --> 02:07:58.740
And I saw one who got kicked her whole family off and she had small children.

2182
02:07:59.981 --> 02:08:02.680
She was breastfeeding one of them.
And they were like,

2183
02:08:02.890 --> 02:08:07.090
we're going to taxi now and you need to,
you know,
I watch you get kicked off.

2184
02:08:07.330 --> 02:08:12.330
She gave the lady attitude about the flight attendant attitude when the flight

2185
02:08:12.581 --> 02:08:14.050
attendant asked her,
um,

2186
02:08:14.710 --> 02:08:17.410
I don't know if she asked her to stop breastfeeding while we were going to taxi,

2187
02:08:18.130 --> 02:08:19.870
but she told her like,
you know,

2188
02:08:19.871 --> 02:08:23.470
why don't you just worry about the drinks while I'm breastfeeding?

2189
02:08:23.770 --> 02:08:27.790
And they were like,
ah.
And then we stopped and they actually,
that one,

2190
02:08:27.791 --> 02:08:31.420
they had police come out to the,
uh,
to the point,
he even go back.

2191
02:08:31.421 --> 02:08:35.560
The police came out of,
they opened the door.
They just get off on the power.

2192
02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:39.250
Absolutely.
I think sometimes,
uh,
I think sometimes they,

2193
02:08:39.490 --> 02:08:44.260
they absolutely want to protect themselves and they have to,
you know,

2194
02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:49.300
you can't have somebody who's a,
an actual threat to the flight.
But I think,

2195
02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:53.410
I think there's definitely a thrill and knowing that if somebody gives you kind

2196
02:08:53.411 --> 02:08:55.630
of a little jab,
kind of a little attitude,
you can be like,

2197
02:08:55.690 --> 02:08:58.330
I could fuck up your day right now.
Yeah.
Pretty,
pretty badly.

2198
02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:00.850
And I can justify it.
And we were talking about that,

2199
02:09:00.910 --> 02:09:05.910
that this ability to hijack you is kind of the same thing because in a normal

2200
02:09:06.041 --> 02:09:10.270
scenario,
you don't have to listen to this person.
You're not stuck in a chair,

2201
02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:13.440
literally strapped in with a fucking belt.
Yeah.

2202
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:18.830
You have to listen and then they can just hover over you and just shit in your

2203
02:09:19.631 --> 02:09:20.464
face.

2204
02:09:23.820 --> 02:09:24.850
<v 11>Headphones,
Amazon</v>

2205
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:27.570
<v 4>in your hood and your glasses.
That's why I do that.</v>

2206
02:09:27.571 --> 02:09:30.630
In the middle of a conversation when you're having a conversation with another

2207
02:09:30.631 --> 02:09:34.290
guy and then you're having a wine and then all of a sudden,
boom,
you're stuck.

2208
02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:36.900
The glasses,
I don't know if you remember the glasses where these,

2209
02:09:37.170 --> 02:09:40.350
they're like tasting glasses.
They weren't very small,
very small.

2210
02:09:40.890 --> 02:09:45.810
And the first time I had two sips in his empty and she goes,

2211
02:09:45.811 --> 02:09:48.020
do you want a refill?
And I go,
yeah.
She goes,
oh,

2212
02:09:48.030 --> 02:09:52.290
I had a couple of drinkers up here and I was like,
it's Kinda like,
you know,

2213
02:09:52.350 --> 02:09:55.710
I can see a certain person,
not me personally,

2214
02:09:55.711 --> 02:09:59.230
but I could see that comment really setting somebody off the,

2215
02:09:59.350 --> 02:10:04.070
the outside implication of like a couple of drunks.
I don't want to say anyway.

2216
02:10:04.610 --> 02:10:08.400
No,
no,
no need to say anymore than we already said.
We already got to cruel.

2217
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:11.070
Poor Lady.
She's lonely.
She wants to talk to people.

2218
02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:15.390
Was just crushed a couple of assholes.
That's okay.
That's all I know.
I feel.

2219
02:10:15.391 --> 02:10:20.390
I feel it right about it.
It's an inability to read social cues.
Yes.

2220
02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:22.660
Oh,
there's no doubt.
She has no doubt.
Zero ability.

2221
02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:25.900
She wasn't good at it or she didn't care.
She just wanted to talk.
You know,

2222
02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:28.440
who knows?
A lot of people,
by the way,

2223
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:31.050
are a little pilled up and they don't even know that.

2224
02:10:31.051 --> 02:10:33.980
You don't want them to talk to you like there's some every

2225
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.020
<v 0>peak,
everything's gonna be okay folks.</v>

2226
02:10:36.230 --> 02:10:39.590
Here's a few of those people that are an antidepressant.
The fuck up,

2227
02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:44.900
super duper common.
If you look at the number of prescriptions sold,

2228
02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:45.970
the number of anti disco,

2229
02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:50.270
a antidepressant prescriptions that are sold in this country every year,

2230
02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:54.140
it's staggering.
I believe it's like 30 million,

2231
02:10:54.290 --> 02:10:55.850
30 million people it,
let me see.

2232
02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:58.160
Let's see how many people are on antidepressants.
Let's just guess.

2233
02:10:58.161 --> 02:11:01.280
I'm saying it's about 30 million.
Yeah,
I think I remember that book.

2234
02:11:01.281 --> 02:11:04.310
PROZAC nation was that in the nineties that's when they started it.

2235
02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:08.450
It's exploded and like everyone was on Prozac squad.
It's such a huge industry.

2236
02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:12.160
I know.
I know a handful of people have a friend on PROZAC.
Yeah,
good guy too.

2237
02:11:12.290 --> 02:11:14.300
Great Guy.
Astounding.

2238
02:11:14.301 --> 02:11:19.250
Increase in antidepressant use by Americans like Harvard University study,

2239
02:11:19.820 --> 02:11:23.870
Harvard health publications from Harvard Medical School where you could just

2240
02:11:23.871 --> 02:11:26.360
smoke weed,
right.
People 12 and over,

2241
02:11:26.361 --> 02:11:30.170
increased by almost 400%

2242
02:11:30.850 --> 02:11:31.683
<v 6>hmm.</v>

2243
02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:33.780
<v 0>Wow.</v>

2244
02:11:34.510 --> 02:11:35.110
<v 6>Okay.</v>

2245
02:11:35.110 --> 02:11:40.110
<v 0>Between 1988 to 1994 and then from 2005 to 2008</v>

2246
02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:42.473
<v 6>yeah.</v>

2247
02:11:43.110 --> 02:11:45.210
<v 0>That's incredible.
Holy Shit.</v>

2248
02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:50.360
23% of all people on antidepressants are women in their forties and fifties no,

2249
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:52.183
no,
no.
Excuse me.

2250
02:11:52.350 --> 02:11:57.330
23% of women in their forties and fifties are on antidepressants.
Wow.

2251
02:11:58.710 --> 02:12:01.470
Yeah,
but that's the one and 3% holy shit.

2252
02:12:01.860 --> 02:12:03.690
You're going through the change of life,

2253
02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:06.930
a higher percentage than any other group by age or sex.

2254
02:12:06.931 --> 02:12:08.100
Just stop and think about that.

2255
02:12:08.101 --> 02:12:13.050
23% of women in their forties and fifties are on a pill that keeps him happy.

2256
02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:14.100
Statistically.

2257
02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:16.860
That's a really good chance that our flight attendant is one of those pieces.

2258
02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:19.500
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.
Look,

2259
02:12:19.501 --> 02:12:23.160
I had a friend that was on it and one of the things he said to me was that when

2260
02:12:23.161 --> 02:12:25.980
he was on it,
nothing bothered him.
He was on Zoloft and he's like,

2261
02:12:26.010 --> 02:12:30.360
nothing bothers me.
Nothing doesn't conveys me now that everything's fine,

2262
02:12:31.110 --> 02:12:34.230
nothing bothers me.
Yeah.
And those kinds of people that they don't,

2263
02:12:34.410 --> 02:12:35.940
they don't see things coming.
They don't see.

2264
02:12:35.970 --> 02:12:37.920
So they're not aware that they're being weird.

2265
02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:40.980
I wonder what it would be interesting.
Obviously it won't happen,

2266
02:12:40.981 --> 02:12:45.810
but to hear what her version of that dialogue would be.
You know what I mean?

2267
02:12:46.490 --> 02:12:49.370
It's also kind of like,
it was great.
Talk to those guys.
So much fun.

2268
02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:51.780
These two guys were making wine.
We had a great conversation.
They love me.

2269
02:12:51.810 --> 02:12:53.980
They love my fucking anecdotes about [inaudible].

2270
02:12:54.030 --> 02:12:58.590
I told him the sideway story and uh,
never seen two guys have a better time.

2271
02:13:00.020 --> 02:13:02.430
I mean they were pretty,
they were pretty under the fucking,

2272
02:13:03.330 --> 02:13:06.240
one of them had two drinks.
The other one hand about fine,

2273
02:13:07.020 --> 02:13:10.350
maybe a total four ounces.
They were there.
They were,

2274
02:13:10.351 --> 02:13:14.800
they were really little glasses.
Spin glass of wine.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2275
02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:16.370
We got a couple of drunks and the fourth,

2276
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:19.650
I don't know if that was what was going on if she was on antidepressants,

2277
02:13:19.651 --> 02:13:23.860
but I do know that she wasn't good at reading shit.
No negative.
No,
no.

2278
02:13:23.930 --> 02:13:27.270
You entered,
you meet people like that all the time.
Yes.
I'm related to a few,

2279
02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:27.950
but the,

2280
02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:32.940
so the question is should she have to completely or life get her shit together,

2281
02:13:32.941 --> 02:13:36.060
change your diet,
start exercising.
You start taking care of her.
How?

2282
02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:41.100
Start applying different philosophies to are alive at years of age,
you know,
and,

2283
02:13:41.101 --> 02:13:45.210
and advanced age or she's just take a fucking pill.
It makes her happier,
right?

2284
02:13:45.220 --> 02:13:48.630
I exactly,
yes.
I don't have really,
not life does not.
It's not,

2285
02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:50.340
it doesn't live forever.
Doesn't definitely,

2286
02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:52.460
there's definitely an easier path and uh,

2287
02:13:52.930 --> 02:13:56.130
seems like a little more resistance in another path.

2288
02:13:56.190 --> 02:13:59.520
But then on the processors are comparing the duck.
Yeah.
Browse with you.

2289
02:13:59.610 --> 02:14:04.140
Take one of these less than a third of Americans who are taking a single

2290
02:14:04.141 --> 02:14:09.141
antidepressant as opposed to two or more have seen a mental health professional

2291
02:14:09.211 --> 02:14:13.560
in the past year.
So people are just,
they're just taking the pills.
I'm fine.

2292
02:14:13.561 --> 02:14:17.670
Scary without any kind of supervision.
I'm a mental health professional.
Yes.

2293
02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:21.690
And as are you,
you guys provide mental health relief in the form of comedy.

2294
02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:24.000
That's true.
Well,
mental health professional from now on.

2295
02:14:26.510 --> 02:14:29.880
<v 3>I've never done them,
but I hear what distributors of Mental Health for sure.</v>

2296
02:14:29.881 --> 02:14:31.530
Yeah.
But I hear it can be helpful.

2297
02:14:31.531 --> 02:14:34.980
Like if we're going through some really depressing time just to kind of allow

2298
02:14:34.981 --> 02:14:39.490
you to get some distance to get clarity on the issue.
I mean,
I,

2299
02:14:39.500 --> 02:14:41.880
again,
I'm going to take a pill.
Can help you.
Yeah.

2300
02:14:41.881 --> 02:14:46.230
Like let's say something really tragic,
like your spouse dies and you just,

2301
02:14:46.231 --> 02:14:50.100
you can't even go on.
I guess it helps to give you some kind of perspective.

2302
02:14:50.540 --> 02:14:53.010
<v 0>Well,
you know,
it's one of the best for that.
Bless you.
Yeah.</v>

2303
02:14:53.050 --> 02:14:56.540
Know what the best is.
Um,
uh,
ecstasy.
Yes.

2304
02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:01.640
MDMS incredible for grief.
Relief for post traumatic stress.

2305
02:15:01.790 --> 02:15:04.280
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
For people with PTSD,

2306
02:15:04.281 --> 02:15:07.310
for people who've been victimized or people who have had horrible things happen

2307
02:15:07.311 --> 02:15:07.491
to them.

2308
02:15:07.491 --> 02:15:12.491
They say it's an almost immediate and really like fulfilled relief.

2309
02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:14.720
Like it's not just a temporary relief.

2310
02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:18.470
It's a relief where you gain perspective on like the like maybe you know,

2311
02:15:18.471 --> 02:15:23.471
I had a terrible breakup and you take ecstasy and whatever reason it allows you

2312
02:15:23.481 --> 02:15:26.830
to see things in a different way where you forgive and wow.

2313
02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:29.590
One of the big no idea.
Yeah.
It's supposed to be amazing for that.

2314
02:15:29.610 --> 02:15:33.050
Supposed to be amazing for stress.
Two foot soldiers and shit.
Yeah.

2315
02:15:33.110 --> 02:15:37.910
Soldiers coming back from the war with PTSD.
It's a huge problem.
Don Can,

2316
02:15:37.911 --> 02:15:39.800
you know,
put it in perspective first.
He goes,

2317
02:15:39.801 --> 02:15:42.620
you think about how many people are over there that experiencing things and no

2318
02:15:42.621 --> 02:15:46.000
one hears seeing and then they're going to come here and then they're going to

2319
02:15:46.001 --> 02:15:50.270
try to integrate in society and get some Shitty fucking job out and try to

2320
02:15:50.271 --> 02:15:54.290
forget everything they did.
Yeah.
All them killing.
Yeah.

2321
02:15:54.330 --> 02:15:58.530
<v 3>Dude,
I was only,
I went to Afghanistan for two weeks,
like a couple years ago,</v>

2322
02:15:58.890 --> 02:16:02.370
and just in two weeks being a spectator to a war,

2323
02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:07.200
just being a tourist in all of it was,
so you saw me when I came back,
I was like,

2324
02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:11.760
Shell shocked.
I had to,
I sat in my shrink's couch,
like balling.
Wow.
You see,

2325
02:16:11.761 --> 02:16:11.941
you know,

2326
02:16:11.941 --> 02:16:15.900
you tore the hospitals and you see little eight year old boys who fell into a

2327
02:16:15.901 --> 02:16:17.160
fire and they're burned.

2328
02:16:17.170 --> 02:16:21.720
Are you seeing the 20 year old kids who stepped on IED and they lose their limbs

2329
02:16:21.721 --> 02:16:26.070
or their faces are blown off?
It's terrible.
Yeah.
Really crazy.
And I didn't even,

2330
02:16:26.071 --> 02:16:30.030
I saw a fraction of it,
you know what I mean?
I,
yeah.
So if you're there,
give me a

2331
02:16:30.030 --> 02:16:33.860
<v 0>tour day after day.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,</v>

2332
02:16:34.250 --> 02:16:37.690
war of war toward not like a tour of performing.

2333
02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:41.760
That's why when that guy went over and,
um,
he was,
uh,

2334
02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:45.470
suffering from PTSD and they will have just some murdering a bunch of people and

2335
02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:47.950
killed a bunch of civilians.
And they were like,

2336
02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:49.450
this guy had been crying for help.

2337
02:16:49.451 --> 02:16:52.870
Like this isn't like this guy had been talking about his PTSD trying to get out

2338
02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:56.140
of the arm and they sent them over there again,
he just cracked.

2339
02:16:56.380 --> 02:17:00.370
I mean literally reached a point where he cracked and you can only see so much

2340
02:17:00.371 --> 02:17:03.910
brutality so much before you lose your perspective.

2341
02:17:03.911 --> 02:17:06.410
You lose humanity and we don't take can,
I'm not enough.
Yeah.

2342
02:17:06.420 --> 02:17:09.070
And I'm not excusing what he did by any stretch of the imagination,

2343
02:17:09.071 --> 02:17:11.110
but I'm saying is when something like that happens,

2344
02:17:11.111 --> 02:17:15.370
you got to wonder like what makes a person capable of doing that?

2345
02:17:16.020 --> 02:17:17.200
Because they didn't do it.
But what they do,
they,

2346
02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:20.350
were they a psycho going in or do you make them a psycho?

2347
02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:22.950
Does their experiences make them a psycho?
Does the,
the,

2348
02:17:23.090 --> 02:17:27.010
the lack of feeling make them want to do something that shocks them?
I mean,

2349
02:17:27.011 --> 02:17:29.680
do they get to the point where they see so much killing and he's killed so many

2350
02:17:29.681 --> 02:17:30.970
people that they're not even,

2351
02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:35.320
they're not even aware of what's real or what's not and how medicated are they?

2352
02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:39.400
Or what are they medicated?
Do even know that that's your job to kill people.

2353
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:42.100
That's the crazy part is they're like,
here,

2354
02:17:42.101 --> 02:17:44.080
you're getting a paycheck to kill people.

2355
02:17:44.740 --> 02:17:48.430
That's a hard thing to wrap your head around as a civilian.
US soldiers,

2356
02:17:48.431 --> 02:17:52.920
here we go.
That soldiers are dangerously,
dangerously over.

2357
02:17:52.940 --> 02:17:56.410
This is an,
um,
uh,
this article,
natural news.

2358
02:17:56.411 --> 02:18:01.270
Is that a real website US soldiers dangerously overmedicated with antipsychotic

2359
02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:03.970
drugs.
Yeah.

2360
02:18:05.020 --> 02:18:09.790
So that apparently there's a lot of them that they have like real issues with

2361
02:18:09.791 --> 02:18:13.720
war and they give them Prozac.
You need somebody,

2362
02:18:13.721 --> 02:18:18.340
you need to put people in there that,
um,
I'm saying like,

2363
02:18:18.341 --> 02:18:22.660
it's not for everybody.
You know,
like,
I think that you should almost,

2364
02:18:22.661 --> 02:18:25.420
there should almost be a clause where like,
you can go and be like,

2365
02:18:25.450 --> 02:18:30.450
I can't do this and they should let you [inaudible] NBC news heavily armed and

2366
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:35.520
medicated.
That's a sudden fucking Newsweek.
Or,
uh,

2367
02:18:35.550 --> 02:18:40.060
NBC News Rather.
Wow.
Yeah.
Those guys,
I feel bad for them.

2368
02:18:40.061 --> 02:18:44.850
She'd get a card like you get into the military,
Yo,
this isn't for me.
Yeah,

2369
02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:48.340
you should be able to.
It's not,
here's the deal.
It's not for anybody.

2370
02:18:48.341 --> 02:18:50.680
It's not for anybody,
but there's some know what it is for.

2371
02:18:50.681 --> 02:18:54.340
It's for Psychos and people who think that it's something that it's not.

2372
02:18:54.620 --> 02:18:57.280
And then when they get over there,
they realize,
oh,
I'm not defending my country.

2373
02:18:57.281 --> 02:19:00.640
I'm working for this brutal company that doesn't give a fuck about any people.

2374
02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:03.400
It's comprised of people.
And yet it doesn't care about people.

2375
02:19:03.570 --> 02:19:07.000
It just cares about siphoning out money and distributing to a few people that

2376
02:19:07.001 --> 02:19:10.270
will never be over here killing people.

2377
02:19:10.570 --> 02:19:12.460
That's the weirdest thing at all of all.

2378
02:19:12.461 --> 02:19:16.690
When you look at the amount of money that gets siphoned out of war and then

2379
02:19:16.691 --> 02:19:20.410
inject it into the bank accounts of people that don't kill anybody,

2380
02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:24.160
don't risk any life,
don't risk their health for a second.

2381
02:19:24.670 --> 02:19:28.250
And they're living like fucking bankers.
They're living

2382
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:30.920
<v 2>like gangsters.
They're,
they're,
they're,
you know,</v>

2383
02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:34.700
if you look at the people that are making the most money out of war,
I mean,

2384
02:19:34.701 --> 02:19:39.050
it's quite shocking the amount of money that you can extract and never have to

2385
02:19:39.051 --> 02:19:42.410
kill anybody.
Yeah.
That's why they'll always be wars forever and ever.

2386
02:19:42.411 --> 02:19:45.020
And I don't know about that man.
I don't know about that.
I don't think,
I don't.

2387
02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:47.300
I think the,
it's like,
it's like,
you know,

2388
02:19:47.301 --> 02:19:52.100
you look at those pharmaceutical statistics and you realize that industry,

2389
02:19:52.130 --> 02:19:57.130
that lobby is too powerful and it's too strong for it to get defeated though.

2390
02:19:57.431 --> 02:20:00.020
That's why those,
those pills will be around.
There'll be new pills,

2391
02:20:00.021 --> 02:20:00.854
they'll be new drugs.

2392
02:20:01.100 --> 02:20:06.100
War is such a profitable device that I don't think you could,

2393
02:20:07.370 --> 02:20:10.580
I mean,
idealistically,
obviously you don't want there to be wars,

2394
02:20:10.581 --> 02:20:14.540
but I just don't,
I think that there's too much to be gained,
unfortunately.

2395
02:20:14.660 --> 02:20:19.420
I wonder America definitely,
definitely,
definitely,
definitely for sure.
Yeah.

2396
02:20:20.130 --> 02:20:22.910
Yeah.
So you think there's no way to fix it?
Well,
Laura,
just so into it,

2397
02:20:22.911 --> 02:20:26.390
we're so in,
right?
But how can we can fix it?
How about if we ran the world?

2398
02:20:26.391 --> 02:20:28.190
If the world consistent of everybody in this room,

2399
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:30.140
I'm pretty sure no one's going to kill anybody.

2400
02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:33.560
You might get mad at Brian if you fucking take some pictures,

2401
02:20:34.100 --> 02:20:36.170
penis over your forehead while you're sleeping or something.

2402
02:20:36.171 --> 02:20:40.160
But Brian would be the one that would get attacked the first,
I think.
Yeah,

2403
02:20:40.161 --> 02:20:42.800
he did talk to her,
but I don't think we kill him.
No,

2404
02:20:43.130 --> 02:20:44.530
<v 3>I wouldn't murder him.
No.</v>

2405
02:20:44.550 --> 02:20:47.940
I would just relegate him to some kind of job where he had no authority.

2406
02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:51.600
It wasn't hunting.
No hunting for Brian.
Yes.

2407
02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:54.070
<v 2>He wasn't bringing in his food.
He was eating all your food.</v>

2408
02:20:54.071 --> 02:20:56.530
You get a little annoyed like Brian,
you haven't killed one rabbit.

2409
02:20:58.830 --> 02:21:02.470
I sold my buzzer partying.
It was it old garden with my butt hole,

2410
02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:04.760
<v 3>Joe.
I see it.
I see.
In your future,</v>

2411
02:21:04.850 --> 02:21:08.750
would you start a society like a compound where everybody hunts their own food

2412
02:21:08.751 --> 02:21:09.770
and grows her own food?

2413
02:21:09.900 --> 02:21:13.500
<v 2>Well then they're gonna come and get you that nobody wants anybody to be self</v>

2414
02:21:13.501 --> 02:21:14.940
sustaining inside this country.

2415
02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.370
<v 3>Who's going to,
who's going to get the government will shut it down.
You Go.</v>

2416
02:21:17.371 --> 02:21:20.620
You will come in with.
Yeah,
that's so true.
I forgot about that part.

2417
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:23.410
<v 2>You could have a community,
but they would infiltrate it.</v>

2418
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:24.790
Government would infiltrate it.

2419
02:21:24.791 --> 02:21:27.190
And then they find someone who is selling mushrooms,
right.
Someone.

2420
02:21:27.191 --> 02:21:28.650
And then they'd come in and Boston,

2421
02:21:29.650 --> 02:21:34.150
the idea of someone getting a strong hold on a group of people with a different

2422
02:21:34.151 --> 02:21:34.841
ideology,

2423
02:21:34.841 --> 02:21:38.350
a nonsupportive ideology of the thing that's running the country right now.

2424
02:21:38.740 --> 02:21:41.350
They're not down for that.
Very true.
It's just natural.

2425
02:21:41.380 --> 02:21:42.760
It's natural to try to fight that off.

2426
02:21:44.260 --> 02:21:48.400
<v 3>Oh,
sidebar.
Have you seen,
sorry,
cause I had a thought and I was,
I was driving,</v>

2427
02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:53.500
we were driving to Downey like ages ago and there is a billboard for the marines

2428
02:21:53.501 --> 02:21:57.850
and it was like Mexican traditions,
be it be a good Mexican,

2429
02:21:57.851 --> 02:22:01.820
be a marine.
And you're like,
yeah,
well this is so evil.
It's sad.
Right?

2430
02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:04.460
Well you know I'm looking,
I read Max.
I wasn't,
I guess get to know.

2431
02:22:05.470 --> 02:22:09.460
Oh Wow.
That is really sneaky.
That's,
that's how you appeal to a,

2432
02:22:09.461 --> 02:22:10.780
a poor young dude,

2433
02:22:10.781 --> 02:22:15.010
right up to this ideal of manhood of perceived.

2434
02:22:16.030 --> 02:22:18.010
<v 2>Well,
those are all those crush,
those commercials.</v>

2435
02:22:18.340 --> 02:22:21.550
They all appeal to your sense of wanting to be a great,

2436
02:22:22.290 --> 02:22:26.220
impactful person to be an adventure,
to be,
you know,
something

2437
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:29.100
<v 4>to be a warrior.
Yeah.
Someone who's noble,</v>

2438
02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:31.800
when there's that stand there and slide that sort of,
yeah,

2439
02:22:31.801 --> 02:22:34.680
it looks great though to an 18 year old boy wouldn't,
you'd be like,
fuck yeah,

2440
02:22:34.720 --> 02:22:36.300
that's great.
Do a 45 year old man.

2441
02:22:36.770 --> 02:22:39.420
We just smart enough to realize why it looks great.
Yeah.

2442
02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:41.790
When you see the propaganda though,

2443
02:22:42.030 --> 02:22:46.170
that's so guided towards a group that's not you is when you realize how much

2444
02:22:46.171 --> 02:22:50.790
there's propaganda,
you know,
like you don't see it as propaganda.

2445
02:22:51.150 --> 02:22:54.600
When you see it as an APP,
you're like,
oh,
this is a thing.
But then when you,

2446
02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:58.930
when it's so like geared towards another group,
you know,

2447
02:22:58.931 --> 02:23:02.340
like that banking commercial we saw,
Oh God,
it was ridiculous.

2448
02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:04.750
The girl comes home with her check and uh,

2449
02:23:04.770 --> 02:23:07.740
she's like speaking Spanish and English,
you know,
and it's like,

2450
02:23:07.741 --> 02:23:11.790
this is just so to like,
you know,
appeal to the Spanish speaking,

2451
02:23:12.180 --> 02:23:14.040
but it's like,
it's such a,
you know,

2452
02:23:14.041 --> 02:23:16.820
she's just like Spanish and English that she gets how much he's like Meta.

2453
02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:17.500
I got my first

2454
02:23:17.500 --> 02:23:21.700
<v 1>Jack and then know when they're like,
she's so happy.</v>

2455
02:23:22.090 --> 02:23:26.350
And then she's like,
look at my check.
He's like,
she like takes a picture.

2456
02:23:26.530 --> 02:23:29.440
She's like,
no,
I'm making a deposit.

2457
02:23:29.680 --> 02:23:33.300
And it's just like a Spanish English conversation.
And they eat tacos.
Yeah,

2458
02:23:33.310 --> 02:23:34.143
they're like making,

2459
02:23:34.820 --> 02:23:37.880
<v 4>yeah.
So they're like,
just in case some white people really love Mexicans.</v>

2460
02:23:37.881 --> 02:23:40.040
We'll throw a few English right here.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2461
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:44.690
And it's just like you fucking apes.
Totally.
Any white people,

2462
02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:47.150
this is not for you to post to like,

2463
02:23:47.151 --> 02:23:51.770
this is really supposed to be effective to the person who's Latino who's like,

2464
02:23:51.771 --> 02:23:56.330
I don't trust banks.
And they're like this pretty cool.
So it's just for a bank.

2465
02:23:56.600 --> 02:23:59.630
Yeah,
it's a,
it's a major bank.
The bank giving you money.

2466
02:24:00.260 --> 02:24:02.630
What's the mass giving you a check in the commercial?
No,

2467
02:24:02.631 --> 02:24:05.570
the other girls come home with from her first.
She's got her first paycheck.

2468
02:24:05.630 --> 02:24:07.760
Right.
So she's just like,
I got my first paycheck.

2469
02:24:07.810 --> 02:24:11.870
I'll say she wants to put it in that bank.
Right.
Cause it's the smart one.
Yeah.

2470
02:24:12.050 --> 02:24:14.450
That's the one that's going to take care of your money.
Right.
I see

2471
02:24:17.050 --> 02:24:20.730
what you're sitting in the bank.
Come on.
Don't be soon.
You gotta Save the money.

2472
02:24:20.731 --> 02:24:24.000
You don't feel it.
Don't be a fool.
Yeah.

2473
02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:28.080
You ever go to a neighborhood where all the signs are different languages and we

2474
02:24:28.100 --> 02:24:31.810
lived in a couple.
Ah,
where did you live?
Uh,

2475
02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:36.800
j town and then we lived in basically little El Salvador,
which is just adjacent.

2476
02:24:37.230 --> 02:24:39.710
You guys were in the hood for awhile.
Macarthur Park.

2477
02:24:40.830 --> 02:24:43.760
We are in a real shit hole.
When we got married,
we were so broke.

2478
02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:48.050
We heard Bang Bang's Tommy,
tell,
tell Joe you're famous.
Bang,
Bang,

2479
02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:52.790
Bang,
Bang.
One was like two in the afternoon.

2480
02:24:53.330 --> 02:24:57.920
I'm sitting on our living room couch,
which is basically,
you have a,

2481
02:24:57.980 --> 02:25:01.460
you could just look right into MacArthur park.
I'm sitting on the couch,

2482
02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:02.480
pants down,

2483
02:25:02.570 --> 02:25:06.810
jerking off to porn on my laptop and I just hear like cop,

2484
02:25:07.980 --> 02:25:12.590
like fucking jump on the ground.
Like I jump on the ground full boner,

2485
02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:14.330
like woo,
like am I in trouble?

2486
02:25:14.330 --> 02:25:18.320
Like it's so terrifying to be in that thought process and hear that loud.

2487
02:25:18.740 --> 02:25:22.880
And I just,
I pull my pants up and the first thing I do,
you're not.

2488
02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:26.530
So I call our Jose are whatever's,

2489
02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:31.550
he doesn't fucking listen to the show today is,
uh,
the building,
you know,

2490
02:25:31.810 --> 02:25:36.460
manager every morning.
So I call him and he's like,
what's up?
And I go,

2491
02:25:36.461 --> 02:25:39.670
dude,
what the fuck was that?
And he goes,
what was what?
And I go,

2492
02:25:39.671 --> 02:25:41.530
you didn't hear that shit?
He goes,
no,

2493
02:25:41.531 --> 02:25:45.070
I go sound like it was on my fucking like back,
like on my balcony.

2494
02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:49.090
Now I'm in the garage,
man.
I was like,
all right.
And I'm like,

2495
02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:53.590
this is unbelievable.
And then two minutes go by,
my phone rings and he's like,

2496
02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:56.230
Hey,
yeah man,
I just talked to somebody.
Uh,

2497
02:25:56.260 --> 02:26:00.340
somebody just got shot on the street out in front.
That's what you heard.

2498
02:26:00.820 --> 02:26:05.820
And then they shut down every fucking possible entrance to our street.

2499
02:26:06.910 --> 02:26:10.750
And what happened was a guy went up to another guy,

2500
02:26:11.410 --> 02:26:16.330
two in the afternoon,
broad daylight and put a 45.
Right.
Like pull that out,

2501
02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:18.770
shot him in the chest,
random.
Uh,

2502
02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:23.230
it was a gang thing and then didn't even run.
He just waited there,

2503
02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:28.810
waited,
waited for the cops to get arrested,
I guess.
Yeah.
There was a lot,

2504
02:26:28.811 --> 02:26:32.350
a lot of gang shit and that neighborhood.
Yeah.
Why did they wait?

2505
02:26:32.351 --> 02:26:34.510
Do they want to go back to jail?
I don't know that part,

2506
02:26:34.511 --> 02:26:39.490
it wasn't explained to me,
but the,
the shooting was like that,
you know,

2507
02:26:40.060 --> 02:26:42.670
the whole thing was that he just,
I think it was a marked guy,

2508
02:26:42.700 --> 02:26:45.820
like he had done something and they were like,
this is a retaliation.
Ooh,

2509
02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:48.600
living that gang neighborhoods.
Not Cool.
No.

2510
02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:52.490
<v 3>What was neat though is that LAPD installed these,
uh,</v>

2511
02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:57.500
like sound devices where they'd put them up on a light post or somewhere and

2512
02:26:57.501 --> 02:27:02.501
they could actually track exactly where the bullet was shot from within a five

2513
02:27:02.511 --> 02:27:04.350
mile radius.
So like,
that was Kinda cool.

2514
02:27:04.670 --> 02:27:08.420
<v 4>Come in five mile radius.
Yeah,
I think it's,
that seems pretty big</v>

2515
02:27:09.300 --> 02:27:12.570
<v 3>telling you.
Yeah,
look it up.
I may be off on the,
uh,
anyway,</v>

2516
02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:15.960
they could detect exactly where the bullet was coming from apparently.
All right.

2517
02:27:15.961 --> 02:27:16.130
Are

2518
02:27:16.130 --> 02:27:17.030
<v 4>Our last,
uh,</v>

2519
02:27:17.031 --> 02:27:21.010
one of our last nights was a celebratory night where we were room shit man.

2520
02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:26.500
It was a couple days after LAPD had,

2521
02:27:27.020 --> 02:27:32.020
there was a drunk guy on sixth street who was wielding a knife and they lit him

2522
02:27:33.501 --> 02:27:37.250
up like they shot him,
they shot him like fucking,

2523
02:27:37.490 --> 02:27:39.640
I forget it was like 13 or 22 times,

2524
02:27:39.650 --> 02:27:43.760
like something crazy for this drunk guy with a knife.
So they,

2525
02:27:43.850 --> 02:27:48.850
El Salvadoran neighborhood marched towards the Rampart division police

2526
02:27:50.180 --> 02:27:52.390
headquarters and it was banana.

2527
02:27:52.391 --> 02:27:55.460
So we're standing on the roof of our building and no shit.

2528
02:27:55.790 --> 02:27:59.210
There's like 20 police helicopters.

2529
02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:03.890
Like usually there was one or two a night every night.
But like when you see 20,

2530
02:28:03.891 --> 02:28:05.570
you're like,
this is martial law.

2531
02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:09.800
Like it was that neighborhood that night was unlike anything I've ever seen.

2532
02:28:10.190 --> 02:28:14.000
Wow.
It was,
they shot him for no reason.
The guy that should up for no reason.

2533
02:28:15.130 --> 02:28:18.440
He was,
I know.
He was like,
it's like fucking what is supposed to do.

2534
02:28:18.441 --> 02:28:22.010
Give them book.
Yeah.
Give him a book.
Teach him how to right.
Show

2535
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:26.750
<v 0>them how to wash his ass with his hand.
But I think,
no,
it was,
it's crazy.</v>

2536
02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:30.230
I mean the whole thing was,
it is obviously excessive force,

2537
02:28:30.231 --> 02:28:32.300
but it just habit to use their guns.
Yeah.

2538
02:28:32.301 --> 02:28:34.710
They're excited about the reason to do it.
Some assholes got a knife.

2539
02:28:34.970 --> 02:28:39.440
Like this dude is just family.
Two miles,
two miles,
two miles,

2540
02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:44.840
three miles off the Brio.
Pretty big man.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2541
02:28:44.841 --> 02:28:47.710
That's not good.
Brian Kallan was on his street and uh,

2542
02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:49.520
his neighbor couldn't drive his car,

2543
02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:52.550
couldn't figure out why he's carpet and starts you guys to Carto and they found

2544
02:28:52.551 --> 02:28:56.220
a bullet in the engine block and there was a shootout on a street and a stray

2545
02:28:56.221 --> 02:29:00.020
bullet slammed into his engine.
Jesus.
Yeah.
That's when Brian was like,
oh,

2546
02:29:00.021 --> 02:29:02.170
Okeydokey time to move.
Yeah.

2547
02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:06.620
And then a park where he used to take his daughter to play.
The guy shot a guy.

2548
02:29:06.621 --> 02:29:10.280
They're cool,
man.
I'm to go.
Okay.
Fuck Venice.
Great.

2549
02:29:10.490 --> 02:29:13.190
Venice is great though.
That's what sucks about Venice.

2550
02:29:13.191 --> 02:29:14.810
It's like it has all of that,

2551
02:29:14.811 --> 02:29:19.610
but it's also great cool restaurants and super cool,
cool little art places.

2552
02:29:19.611 --> 02:29:24.470
It's a,
it's a Funky,
I saw the tree slam there once.
Not that great.
I'm sorry.

2553
02:29:25.650 --> 02:29:30.020
Have you been to the tasting kitchen there in Venice?
No.

2554
02:29:30.021 --> 02:29:32.840
I don't know what that is.
A restaurant.
Oh No,
no,
no,
no.
I've never been there.

2555
02:29:33.390 --> 02:29:37.910
Wait,
let's pull it to slam.
What do you like?
What do you like?
Less?

2556
02:29:37.940 --> 02:29:42.170
Poetry slams or musicals.
Poetry slams.
Okay.

2557
02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:44.990
Cause at least musical,
somebody likes them,
right?

2558
02:29:46.020 --> 02:29:47.700
You're pretending so you remember when they have,
yeah.

2559
02:29:47.730 --> 02:29:49.670
<v 1>DEF poetry jam.
Oh yes.</v>

2560
02:29:50.060 --> 02:29:55.060
That was so I stand white man in front of you on conquered on top of the

2561
02:29:55.591 --> 02:29:59.220
universe is my solely turtle shell.
I reach a point,

2562
02:29:59.250 --> 02:30:04.250
a pinnacle in my existence here and your white dominated world power will I do y

2563
02:30:06.530 --> 02:30:08.940
Shalah and that should suck man.

2564
02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:14.750
That's what that should happen with men like me did not have access to books

2565
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:19.530
knowledge,
but now I thrive.
Yes,
there should be.

2566
02:30:19.770 --> 02:30:24.770
Definitely useful and there should be a black guy in the fucking in the rafters

2567
02:30:24.901 --> 02:30:28.230
with a Mike who just gets to after everyone goes,
you shit was whack too man.

2568
02:30:28.231 --> 02:30:29.240
Like just shits on everyday.

2569
02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:33.360
<v 0>It's way worse than black eyes and def poetry jams.
White guys guys.
Yeah.</v>

2570
02:30:33.361 --> 02:30:37.360
Poetry jams,
white guys trying to be black doing that.
Yes.
Rough.

2571
02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:39.570
Here's the problem with those things.

2572
02:30:40.690 --> 02:30:44.070
The art form itself is incredibly unsatisfying.

2573
02:30:44.370 --> 02:30:48.270
Like all you're doing is saying things and you're trying to be profound.

2574
02:30:48.600 --> 02:30:53.010
The only time anybody ever wants to hear anything like really profound like that

2575
02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:56.460
is from someone who is an accomplished person.
Right?

2576
02:30:56.520 --> 02:31:01.520
Like if Russell Simmons Simmons went up and gave a poetry slam about succeeding

2577
02:31:02.491 --> 02:31:03.630
in business,
right.

2578
02:31:03.631 --> 02:31:07.250
Then you would want to see like starting your own business and yeah,

2579
02:31:07.560 --> 02:31:10.140
that's Russell Simmons and it's got some poignancy to it.

2580
02:31:10.440 --> 02:31:15.440
But when you're some self-indulgent fucking Dick Wad and you're just talking

2581
02:31:15.691 --> 02:31:20.280
nonsense and strings,
which was just so bad,
so bad

2582
02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:23.040
<v 1>shit.
And we were already told you you're good at sports.</v>

2583
02:31:23.370 --> 02:31:27.780
Just keep playing sports.
What about the white people that are faster?
Oh yeah.

2584
02:31:27.820 --> 02:31:28.653
How are we going to see

2585
02:31:31.230 --> 02:31:34.540
George Watsky mean to George for George?

2586
02:31:35.080 --> 02:31:37.210
<v 12>What about the first,
if I am right now?</v>

2587
02:31:38.050 --> 02:31:42.660
Oh Christ embarrassing white guy that's got a golf shirt on.

2588
02:31:42.670 --> 02:31:45.460
Super friendly though.
Cause yeah,
cause he's not like,
I'm gonna be funny.

2589
02:31:45.720 --> 02:31:50.720
This is for those among us who got enough play through 12th grade to carry in an

2590
02:31:51.461 --> 02:31:56.461
upside down teaspoon for every kid with the collective romantic prowess of Steve

2591
02:31:56.800 --> 02:32:00.640
Article,
Richard Simmons and screech from saved by the bell.

2592
02:32:00.730 --> 02:32:05.730
This is the anthem Patasa Marla to God in our formative years and this poem,

2593
02:32:06.740 --> 02:32:11.470
it's for every high school virgin who wouldn't have had it any other.

2594
02:32:13.570 --> 02:32:17.080
You don't know the possibilities of a weekend until you've cracked a four pack

2595
02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:18.730
of juice.
Squeeze with your boys,

2596
02:32:18.960 --> 02:32:23.530
pumped the igs big Papa and watched an entire euro star trek the next
generation.

2597
02:32:23.531 --> 02:32:28.190
Never thought on virgin was working in.
I can see what Trekkie's

2598
02:32:31.990 --> 02:32:36.240
<v 1>I feel for that boy.
That boy first is a bunch of things.</v>

2599
02:32:36.241 --> 02:32:40.320
You got to tell him this person while you're breathing heavy has to stop the

2600
02:32:40.350 --> 02:32:43.890
deliveries.
Yeah.
The Quentin Tarantino vibe should've stopped too,

2601
02:32:43.980 --> 02:32:46.110
and he's definitely not going to get laid after this.

2602
02:32:46.820 --> 02:32:49.550
This is this thing that they do where they are in front of black people.
They,

2603
02:32:49.570 --> 02:32:53.910
they,
they act black.
Yeah.
There's black.
The when he talks.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yes,
yes.

2604
02:32:53.911 --> 02:32:57.840
Change the way he talks and it wasn't this,
it wasn't full bore,

2605
02:32:57.870 --> 02:33:00.690
but it was pretty obvious that she was throwing a few more,

2606
02:33:00.691 --> 02:33:01.381
you know what I'm saying?

2607
02:33:01.381 --> 02:33:05.830
So it definitely saying that will be yellow,

2608
02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:09.020
green juice boxes.
You know what I'm saying?
No,
I'm sorry.

2609
02:33:09.390 --> 02:33:13.130
But that's the thing that they do where I'm at to tell you there's a way I got

2610
02:33:13.131 --> 02:33:16.650
to breathe in deaf slam.

2611
02:33:16.651 --> 02:33:21.450
Stupid fucking breathe in between.
You're overly contrive delivery.

2612
02:33:21.460 --> 02:33:22.293
So contrived.

2613
02:33:22.470 --> 02:33:27.180
<v 12>One more.
It's a girl talking about like an ex boyfriend.
I like those bow.</v>

2614
02:33:27.300 --> 02:33:30.150
My heart is broken on the floor.
He said,
and you're like,
ah,

2615
02:33:30.290 --> 02:33:34.700
<v 1>no more.
I'll put another one on.
I know.
It's an awful art form.</v>

2616
02:33:34.730 --> 02:33:37.160
That's it is.
We should just talk about something else.

2617
02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:41.760
It's like standing up with no punchlines delivered by a guy sucks at stand up

2618
02:33:41.790 --> 02:33:43.070
right.
That's what it's like.

2619
02:33:43.130 --> 02:33:47.800
I'm so excited for the amount of hate we will collectively received for this.

2620
02:33:47.870 --> 02:33:51.800
It's going to be brutal,
brutal def poetry slam you have any poems?

2621
02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:54.230
Do you have any old poems that you know?

2622
02:33:54.260 --> 02:33:57.290
How dare you [inaudible] had a gun poetry slam.

2623
02:33:58.500 --> 02:34:01.640
The streets would be cleaner.
I don't know.
I forget how it works.

2624
02:34:01.910 --> 02:34:05.420
If I only had a gun,
I would just wrote something.
That's a good one.

2625
02:34:05.470 --> 02:34:09.010
What was really terrible?
I just think they're misguided though.
16 when I run it.

2626
02:34:09.230 --> 02:34:12.110
Which ones?
The people doing that that I feel like you should tell them.

2627
02:34:12.111 --> 02:34:16.700
You know what you want to perform and that's cool.
This thing that you're doing,

2628
02:34:16.701 --> 02:34:17.830
the whole thing sucks,

2629
02:34:18.310 --> 02:34:23.310
so just get into a different art form.

2630
02:34:24.620 --> 02:34:27.190
You chose the shitty thing.
You know what it's like.

2631
02:34:27.191 --> 02:34:31.840
It's like racing unicycles right?
UNICYCLES are fucking stupid.

2632
02:34:31.850 --> 02:34:35.740
Is Lame and chasing them is even dumber,
right,
because they don't work right.

2633
02:34:35.850 --> 02:34:38.680
They did their terrible get on a bus.
You only way,

2634
02:34:38.890 --> 02:34:42.700
the only reason anybody rides a unicycle is because they're a fucking attention

2635
02:34:42.701 --> 02:34:46.960
whore.
Me The wheels this big and he's only one of them do it.

2636
02:34:46.961 --> 02:34:51.420
The Guy with a paradigm,
that guy we saw the other day,
parents

2637
02:34:53.220 --> 02:34:57.610
just fucking walking around and sweat shorts and a six x shirt.

2638
02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:01.050
We talked about this guy for five minutes.
We looked at him about the winter.

2639
02:35:01.090 --> 02:35:04.390
We couldn't stop because we were inside the car so we could abuse him without

2640
02:35:04.391 --> 02:35:05.200
him hearing it.

2641
02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:09.550
We're just shat upon him for at least five minutes on his lonely stroll with

2642
02:35:09.551 --> 02:35:13.210
that,
you know,
he does just for people to go get a fucking bird snake.

2643
02:35:13.210 --> 02:35:16.900
People are like,
they go,
we'll do that.
Yeah.
How about people with ferrets?

2644
02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:18.850
Ferrets on a leash

2645
02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:23.940
in Miami who had the big lizard on his same thing.

2646
02:35:24.220 --> 02:35:25.990
That guy was smart because he was like,
oh,

2647
02:35:25.991 --> 02:35:28.690
you like this lizard is $20 to take a picture of.
Right.
Of course.

2648
02:35:28.990 --> 02:35:33.030
Which he $20 take a picture with it hoses,

2649
02:35:33.260 --> 02:35:34.990
but see he picked south beach.

2650
02:35:35.230 --> 02:35:37.420
He picked a place where there's all these tourists and they're like,

2651
02:35:37.421 --> 02:35:40.290
this is some shit you would never see anywhere.
This is a guy.

2652
02:35:40.450 --> 02:35:42.320
We came from Wisconsin.
We saw a guy,

2653
02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:44.740
you're not going to believe this with a lizard on his shoulder.

2654
02:35:45.370 --> 02:35:48.190
Have been the craziest thing I've ever seen.
I couldn't believe it.

2655
02:35:48.220 --> 02:35:50.760
You should've came with us and he thought he walked around like

2656
02:35:55.090 --> 02:35:57.860
white people walking down the street.
Silly.
Why people

2657
02:36:00.910 --> 02:36:03.600
does the kind of white people that you would target if you want to start a cult

2658
02:36:03.601 --> 02:36:05.730
too.
Exactly.
But white people bring it all back.

2659
02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:07.600
<v 2>Scientology,
those people,</v>

2660
02:36:07.601 --> 02:36:10.480
if you give them the dynamics book and started getting their email address and

2661
02:36:10.481 --> 02:36:14.280
send it unto Shit,
send him some pamphlets.
Yeah.

2662
02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:17.980
Lot people,
Clearwater,
Florida ever go down there.

2663
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:20.410
So that's a scientologist stronghold.

2664
02:36:20.810 --> 02:36:25.630
My folks used to live there that live in Clearwater and its headquarters world

2665
02:36:25.631 --> 02:36:27.640
headquarters.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2666
02:36:27.641 --> 02:36:31.840
That's the spot where they all decided this is the perfect level of

2667
02:36:32.140 --> 02:36:33.490
intelligence.
Like the,

2668
02:36:33.491 --> 02:36:37.420
the average is way higher there of people that you can trick.
You know,
there's,

2669
02:36:37.421 --> 02:36:39.490
I'm sure there's very smart people in Clearwater,
Florida,

2670
02:36:39.730 --> 02:36:43.720
but there's also a lot of,
it's like serious dummies.
Yeah.
Get Him.

2671
02:36:44.140 --> 02:36:47.440
That's where the charlatans go,
right?
You can get them certain near Tampa,

2672
02:36:47.710 --> 02:36:50.710
which has allowed us,
we talked about that last swingers.
Oh yeah.

2673
02:36:50.820 --> 02:36:52.260
<v 1>Oh my God.
Yeah.</v>

2674
02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:57.060
There was a club in Ocala that no longer exists that was run by swingers,

2675
02:36:57.390 --> 02:36:59.150
swingers corridor.

2676
02:36:59.630 --> 02:37:03.490
<v 2>Hey,
what the hell come on one to watch my wife from me.
Fuck no,</v>

2677
02:37:04.180 --> 02:37:04.940
I'll pass.

2678
02:37:04.940 --> 02:37:08.690
I was with Arri once and we had a guy who drove us in Nashville and he seemed

2679
02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:11.990
like the most straight laced guy until the last day.

2680
02:37:12.170 --> 02:37:15.200
And the last day as he's driving us to the airport,

2681
02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:19.850
he starts talking about swinging.
He starts talking about the rules that he like.

2682
02:37:19.851 --> 02:37:22.850
He goes,
next time you come here,
you know,
take you a swinging club.

2683
02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:27.230
And Ari and I were like,
what?
What are you talking about?

2684
02:37:27.410 --> 02:37:30.710
And so then he starts telling us about the rules that they have.
Like,
well,

2685
02:37:30.711 --> 02:37:33.320
you know,
we have rules.
If I don't,
I'm not comfortable about it.

2686
02:37:33.321 --> 02:37:37.270
She doesn't go with the guy and uh,
you know,
she's not comfortable about it.
Uh,

2687
02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:39.680
I don't go with a girl or sometimes we watch each other,

2688
02:37:39.681 --> 02:37:43.090
but most of the time I don't like watching.
Um,

2689
02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:44.953
that's a lot.

2690
02:37:45.690 --> 02:37:49.460
<v 1>Did you ever share Kristina with a cock holding,</v>

2691
02:37:51.470 --> 02:37:53.660
holding,
holding

2692
02:37:56.480 --> 02:37:59.740
was that word?
Where does that originate from?
Shakespeare.
Yeah.

2693
02:38:00.830 --> 02:38:04.140
I'm sure it sounds like an old timey English sound old timey,

2694
02:38:04.141 --> 02:38:08.940
but I don't know if it is a kit that she like cod piece and cuckolding holding

2695
02:38:08.941 --> 02:38:09.774
its shape

2696
02:38:09.990 --> 02:38:14.670
<v 2>cold in the Wikipedia.
Okay.
Historically,
it's historical,</v>

2697
02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:19.880
historically referred to a husband with an adulterous wife and still often used

2698
02:38:20.551 --> 02:38:23.070
with this meaning and evolutionary biology.

2699
02:38:23.071 --> 02:38:27.270
The term call Cole does apply to males who are unwillingly unwittingly Yvette

2700
02:38:27.271 --> 02:38:31.830
investing parental effort in offsprings that are not genetically their own.
Wow.

2701
02:38:31.831 --> 02:38:34.580
That's deep.
Wow.
So if your stepfather,

2702
02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:37.410
you're a cuckold since the 1990s,

2703
02:38:37.411 --> 02:38:42.060
the term has been wildly used to refer to a sexual fetish in which the fetishist

2704
02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:46.170
is stimulated by their committed partner choosing to have sex with someone else.

2705
02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:50.970
So for some men they get their rocks off that way.
But the original verb,

2706
02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:56.220
the original description of it,
I guess it could be a Var verb as well.
Right?

2707
02:38:56.250 --> 02:39:00.420
Cock holding your car holding.
Sure.
Would you ever do that?
Never.

2708
02:39:00.930 --> 02:39:05.280
It's okay.
First appeared in 1250.
Look at this.
1215,

2709
02:39:05.281 --> 02:39:10.170
a satirical and polemical poem,
the Owl and the Nightingale.

2710
02:39:10.230 --> 02:39:11.190
Wow.

2711
02:39:11.550 --> 02:39:15.930
The term was clearly regarded as an embarrassingly direct,

2712
02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:18.750
as embarrassingly direct as evident.

2713
02:39:19.050 --> 02:39:23.760
Evidence in John lied.
Gates evident in John Lied Gates,

2714

the late 14th century.

2715
02:39:27.541 --> 02:39:31.170
The term also appeared in Jeffrey clot charters.
Miller's tale.

2716
02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:35.110
That's interesting.
Shakespeare's poetry often reference cock holes.

2717
02:39:35.150 --> 02:39:36.920
<v 1>Dang.
Dang.

2719

02:41:07.710 --> 02:41:11.840
Meaning the horned one?
Yeah.
Wow.
So,
uh,
okay,
cool.

2739
02:41:11.970 --> 02:41:16.230
What is that?
What is that fucking fetish guys would want shamed,

2740
02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:19.540
I'm assuming.
I have a friend who,
uh,

2741
02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:23.700
went to a party and the man made his wife below him.

2742
02:41:24.170 --> 02:41:28.560
Like he was the man washed and was giving instruction on how to blow him.

2743
02:41:28.830 --> 02:41:32.070
Wow.
Your friend was the one who did this.

2744
02:41:32.071 --> 02:41:35.910
My friend was sitting outside on the porch at a party and this woman was blowing

2745
02:41:35.911 --> 02:41:40.320
him while the husband was sitting next to the woman giving directions.
Wow.

2746
02:41:40.580 --> 02:41:45.150
And I said,
yeah.
I was like,
Whoa,
dude,
that's so intense.

2747
02:41:45.151 --> 02:41:48.070
Because I feel as though that might violate some trust with me.

2748
02:41:48.130 --> 02:41:50.580
Like I just think,
wait a minute,

2749
02:41:52.370 --> 02:41:56.790
I love you.
I don't want you to do that.
Well I know,
I don't think it's just dad.

2750
02:41:56.791 --> 02:42:01.560
I mean it was weird for my friend who was a single guy to get head from some

2751
02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:05.640
guy's wife while the guy saying rubbers,
Paul's brothers off like he's giving,

2752
02:42:06.180 --> 02:42:08.670
he's giving him direction,
like cradle,
his boss credos those Bosworth,

2753
02:42:08.750 --> 02:42:11.040
the shaft where the show is,
you're going to come,

2754
02:42:11.070 --> 02:42:13.950
he's going to come take it in your mouth.
The whole deal.
Yeah.

2755
02:42:13.951 --> 02:42:17.040
There's free my mouth coming Roth and gotten,
my friend was like,
oh my God,
what?

2756
02:42:17.250 --> 02:42:20.550
He goes,
I started,
it started out like ridiculous.
And then he goes,
but then like,

2757
02:42:20.610 --> 02:42:22.980
like when the guy was like giving instruction,
he goes,

2758
02:42:22.981 --> 02:42:26.280
it's just got really gay and weird and it was all so off.

2759
02:42:27.120 --> 02:42:30.210
The guy was liking it.
Of course.
Yeah.
That's the whole,

2760
02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:32.430
that's the pay off for him.
That's why he does it.

2761
02:42:32.460 --> 02:42:35.620
He likes his wife's sucking a cock.
Oh Wow.
Right in front of them.

2762
02:42:36.450 --> 02:42:38.160
Well I guess it's like that forbidden thing.

2763
02:42:38.161 --> 02:42:40.500
It's like we were talking about at the beginning about porn,

2764
02:42:41.190 --> 02:42:45.000
the gagging and two dicks in the ass.
Like forbidden.

2765
02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:50.080
You know this like you would never teach your wife on a soccer cock in front of

2766
02:42:50.290 --> 02:42:54.750
you rather fuck until she goes sucking cock and I'm going to show it what to do.

2767
02:42:54.820 --> 02:42:57.720
Yeah,
I'm just pitching it to do,
he's such a curve with where those poles.

2768
02:42:58.080 --> 02:42:59.300
Oh rose bowl is dirty bitch.

2769
02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:05.520
Imagine what,

2770
02:43:05.670 --> 02:43:10.380
what the fuck that would be like no Jesus.

2771
02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:15.100
No,
but this is people's lives,
right?
Where's this is your shit

2772
02:43:15.250 --> 02:43:17.680
<v 3>bond between husband and wife and I cannot not.</v>

2773
02:43:17.681 --> 02:43:20.840
We'll just cut the old growth now with the cup holds are swingers.
No,
no.

2774
02:43:20.860 --> 02:43:24.100
You've seen,
cause I'm sure you've been like,
I've had couples,

2775
02:43:24.190 --> 02:43:28.420
they're always never attractive come up to you and they're like,
what's up?

2776
02:43:28.570 --> 02:43:31.360
Like we're going to go out and have a good time.
Do you want to join us?

2777
02:43:31.660 --> 02:43:35.950
And you feel that like,
you know that invitation to come out with us,

2778
02:43:35.951 --> 02:43:36.551
it'd be a great time.

2779
02:43:36.551 --> 02:43:39.640
We're gonna hit this crazy club and like check out my wife's tits and like,

2780
02:43:39.641 --> 02:43:41.920
you know,
they're putting it out there that you know,

2781
02:43:42.220 --> 02:43:44.620
you can have you come party with us.
Weird Shit.

2782
02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:49.210
We've been together now for almost eight years and to the thought of being naked

2783
02:43:49.211 --> 02:43:53.370
with somebody different is so crazy to me.
You haven't seen Brian naked.
Yes,
yes,

2784
02:43:53.380 --> 02:43:54.213
yes.

2785
02:43:55.270 --> 02:43:59.230
You don't want that and that no dairy or days or a day.

2786
02:43:59.231 --> 02:44:03.820
You turn your back on that wonderful opportunity.
Hey Joe,
can I ask you?
Oh,

2787
02:44:03.821 --> 02:44:06.790
would you rather we came up with it when you went in the car?

2788
02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:09.340
This one's just for you.
Okay.
Okay.

2789
02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:13.660
What'd you rather for an entire year all you can eat all,

2790
02:44:13.661 --> 02:44:18.040
you can eat his hot dogs from seven 11 and Gatorade.
Okay.

2791
02:44:18.220 --> 02:44:22.030
That's one option.
Or wait and you can't,
oh,

2792
02:44:22.031 --> 02:44:23.590
and you cannot exercise,

2793
02:44:23.770 --> 02:44:28.140
but you must eat hot dogs and get right or the other option no.

2794
02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:30.610
Or you can't eat or you can't exercise.
That's it.
Right.

2795
02:44:30.940 --> 02:44:33.400
So either you're not allowed to exercise,
but you can eat what you want.

2796
02:44:33.790 --> 02:44:37.720
Or the other one is eating hot dogs and Gatorade,
but you can still exercise.

2797
02:44:38.700 --> 02:44:43.050
<v 0>Hmm.
That's a good question.
Thank you.
So here's the thing you have to consider,</v>

2798
02:44:43.051 --> 02:44:44.940
right?
So you're going to have to go with the no exercise,

2799
02:44:45.030 --> 02:44:47.910
no exercise and eat whatever you want.
Yeah,
yeah.

2800
02:44:47.970 --> 02:44:49.530
I would eat healthy and not exercise,

2801
02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:52.200
but I would do things that would be like exercise.
I'd be like,
well,

2802
02:44:52.201 --> 02:44:56.730
I'm going to just work in a fucking sandbag yard now.
Oh,
right.
I would say,

2803
02:44:56.731 --> 02:44:58.140
hey man,
can I,
uh,

2804
02:44:58.230 --> 02:45:03.230
can I work here for four hours a week and then four days a week that's crafted.

2805
02:45:03.470 --> 02:45:06.660
Oh,
to come in for an hour and just work for like 10 bucks an hour,

2806
02:45:06.661 --> 02:45:10.260
throwing sandbags around.
I would just do it really gangster.
Okay.
What Liz?

2807
02:45:10.430 --> 02:45:14.040
Revise this.
What if you're just,
you can't do that.
That's what I would do though.

2808
02:45:14.050 --> 02:45:17.130
I would,
I would be too smart for you.
You have to,
it will just take a job.

2809
02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:19.930
That would take a hard labor job.
You have to lay in bed,
but you could do,

2810
02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:21.830
but you could do talks.

2811
02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:25.610
You would do all the exercise that you want with your hot dogs and you or it.

2812
02:45:25.620 --> 02:45:30.120
Every day,
every meal I need more new.
Your body would break down.

2813
02:45:30.410 --> 02:45:33.660
How would you,
yeah.
Your body would break down.
You would have a real issue.

2814
02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:37.920
If you were just eating hot dogs and Gatorade and and trying to exercise,

2815
02:45:38.550 --> 02:45:42.930
you wouldn't have the nutrients to sustain any sort of strenuous exercise.

2816
02:45:42.931 --> 02:45:46.520
Can someone please make a exercise video of just hot dog?

2817
02:45:48.410 --> 02:45:50.670
Do you know why?
We'd probably die of scurvy.

2818
02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:54.720
We'd say we did it because one of our friends stayed at our house one time for

2819
02:45:54.721 --> 02:45:58.050
like three days and he ate just hot dogs and gator.
Listen,
man,

2820
02:45:58.051 --> 02:46:01.170
ever since I cut gluten out of my diet,
I Miss Pasta,

2821
02:46:01.171 --> 02:46:03.510
but they have great gluten free pasta.
You know what?

2822
02:46:03.511 --> 02:46:07.560
I really fucking miss a hot dog with a bone,

2823
02:46:07.561 --> 02:46:10.640
a steamy bond with some mustard and sauerkraut.

2824
02:46:10.700 --> 02:46:14.070
I missed that gummy shitty been,
yeah,

2825
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:18.080
I miss Italian bread to browers.
You still eat,
you just can't eat.

2826
02:46:18.081 --> 02:46:22.430
The eyebrow brought worst.
I just don't eat the bun but a hot dogs,

2827
02:46:22.700 --> 02:46:27.680
no miss that to me.
What is this?
Gluten free so that means what component?

2828
02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:32.420
I don't need any bread and eat pasta.
I don't eat anything that has flour in it.

2829
02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:35.660
I've been doing it for about four months,
maybe five months.

2830
02:46:35.930 --> 02:46:40.930
What I've noticed like right away when I first started doing it is how when I,

2831
02:46:41.150 --> 02:46:44.960
when I have meals after meals,
I'm not tired anymore.
Like I used to get tired.

2832
02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:47.810
I would eat a meal.
I'd be like,
oh,

2833
02:46:47.840 --> 02:46:51.620
it hit that fucking lawn dart of just like exhaustion.

2834
02:46:51.621 --> 02:46:55.730
Now I can eat a giant steak and I never get there.
Never get there.

2835
02:46:55.970 --> 02:46:59.870
I can eat potatoes and I never get there.
There's something about gluten,

2836
02:46:59.900 --> 02:47:03.470
about eating pasta.
It never did anything bad to me.

2837
02:47:03.650 --> 02:47:07.430
Like I don't have CELIAC's disease.
It.
It was not something that made me fat,

2838
02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:10.280
but when I quit eating pasta and bread,

2839
02:47:10.550 --> 02:47:14.450
I definitely lost body fat quickly.
I noticed that on my face,

2840
02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:18.170
like my face was like less puffy.
My ring starting to fit in my finger,

2841
02:47:18.171 --> 02:47:21.500
different sweater and I weigh almost the same.
Like I'm like,

2842
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:25.130
oh maybe I lost a few pounds,
like three or four pounds or something like that.

2843
02:47:25.131 --> 02:47:28.040
But it seems like whatever the puffiness was,

2844
02:47:28.100 --> 02:47:32.600
it's like my puffiness number went down cause I was eating pasta and bread every

2845
02:47:32.601 --> 02:47:37.520
meal.
She's love it.
Gluten free bread.
Yes.
It's terrible.

2846
02:47:37.521 --> 02:47:38.690
It's just like fucking cardboard.

2847
02:47:38.870 --> 02:47:41.900
Actually Udis has some pretty decent gluten free bread,

2848
02:47:41.901 --> 02:47:44.240
but it's just simply not as good as gluten bread.

2849
02:47:44.360 --> 02:47:46.310
It's just not cause regular bread.
You know,

2850
02:47:46.311 --> 02:47:49.850
he took regular bed and you machine and turn into a ball and that ball becomes

2851
02:47:49.950 --> 02:47:51.520
like paste.
Yeah,
it's,

2852
02:47:52.220 --> 02:47:56.920
it's like eating gum and there's no nutritional value in that bread.
The problem,

2853
02:47:57.320 --> 02:48:00.160
no sugar.
Doesn't it convert to sugar on your balcony or something?
Yeah,

2854
02:48:00.260 --> 02:48:03.890
it tastes awesome.
Your body doesn't want it at all.
Your body doesn't like it,

2855
02:48:03.950 --> 02:48:06.750
your body doesn't perform as good.
When I started doing,
when I quit it,

2856
02:48:06.770 --> 02:48:10.610
my endurance went up.
Um,
my body started feeling better.

2857
02:48:11.330 --> 02:48:12.800
My back started feeling better.

2858
02:48:12.801 --> 02:48:15.920
Like that's what the advice that I got from a physical therapist.

2859
02:48:16.100 --> 02:48:19.550
She told me that she has great results in people with back injuries telling them

2860
02:48:19.551 --> 02:48:23.570
to quit gluten that did decrease inflammation of gluten actually decreases the

2861
02:48:23.571 --> 02:48:27.710
size of their bulging discs.
I was like,
dad,
it's fucking nuts.
She's like,

2862
02:48:27.711 --> 02:48:31.340
well it makes sense because like knee injuries like a lot of times like the

2863
02:48:31.341 --> 02:48:34.520
swelling and the inflammation of knee injuries,

2864
02:48:34.820 --> 02:48:39.230
you can reduce that as well.
Yeah,
I can see that.
Fucking gluten.

2865
02:48:39.231 --> 02:48:42.280
Don't they tell you just eat fruits and vegetables and meats anyways,

2866
02:48:42.290 --> 02:48:44.600
like keep it living now.
Shouldn't even need that much fruit.

2867
02:48:44.930 --> 02:48:48.800
You should let it limit the amount of fruit and less except like after working

2868
02:48:48.801 --> 02:48:51.740
out as good or while you're working out in the middle of doing things.

2869
02:48:51.741 --> 02:48:55.340
We are burning off a lot of calories.
Fruit's good,
but you should limit,

2870
02:48:55.341 --> 02:48:58.070
definitely limit the amount of juice you drink because we need to drink fruit

2871
02:48:58.071 --> 02:49:01.310
juice.
It's like straight sugar does have fiber in it.

2872
02:49:01.570 --> 02:49:04.160
You know when you eat an apple,
you're getting fiber orange,

2873
02:49:04.161 --> 02:49:06.620
you're getting fiber and you're getting suites where he's just drink Gatorade,

2874
02:49:06.621 --> 02:49:08.010
like all every hot

2875
02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:10.500
<v 2>dogs.
But what would you do,
you guys do?</v>

2876
02:49:10.530 --> 02:49:12.840
Would you take the no exercise or what's your take Gatorade?

2877
02:49:13.230 --> 02:49:16.870
<v 3>I,
I would,
I can't,
cause I'm,
I'm very particular with eating actually.</v>

2878
02:49:16.871 --> 02:49:17.770
Do Watch what I eat.

2879
02:49:18.460 --> 02:49:22.660
I couldn't eat it because you feel like shit when you eat hot dogs and Gatorade

2880
02:49:22.930 --> 02:49:26.140
you feel yeah,
it's not good.
No.

2881
02:49:26.230 --> 02:49:29.800
And you can get by without exercising if you watch your diet properly.

2882
02:49:31.180 --> 02:49:33.880
Yeah,
I think so.
Yeah.
I can't,
I can't eat like

2883
02:49:34.100 --> 02:49:36.920
<v 2>you could definitely get away with being okay.</v>

2884
02:49:37.070 --> 02:49:40.440
<v 3>No.
Yeah.
Not Fantastic.
But at least you can keep your weight down somewhat.</v>

2885
02:49:41.410 --> 02:49:44.340
I just,
I dunno,
the older I get,
the harder it is to eat.
Like shit,

2886
02:49:44.430 --> 02:49:45.540
I can't even do it now.

2887
02:49:45.710 --> 02:49:49.490
<v 2>Well,
plus you would,
I enjoy eating.
That's another part of the problem.
