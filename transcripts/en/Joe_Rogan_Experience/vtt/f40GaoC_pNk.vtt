<v Speaker 2>This was like a secondhand Bo.</v>

36
00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:16.394
<v Speaker 2>I bought off somebody a years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is this something you wanted to do </v>

37
00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 2>for awhile and somehow or another you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to hold the cam?</v>

38
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.480

40
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 2>Desperate girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

41
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.503
<v Speaker 2>I mean I always put up hunting stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously and I think you commented </v>

42
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:39.044
<v Speaker 2>maybe or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't like an unsolicited dom </v>

43
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.560
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

44
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.030
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to get to know you a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

45
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.250
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was a little bit okay </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

46
00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:49.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>

47
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.860
<v Speaker 2>it's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's 2017.</v>

48
00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's free to express themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if something like that built on.</v>

49
00:01:56.631 --> 00:01:57.464
<v Speaker 2>And then we just started archery and are</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to archery than hunting and you </v>

<v Speaker 2>the bow and so he got done with this </v>

52
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:08.210
<v Speaker 2>movie stuff and was here and thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>

56
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.730

<v Speaker 3>So I started reading up about it and,</v>

57
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.260
<v Speaker 3>and I just said,</v>

<v Speaker 3>means a lot to me.</v>

60
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:25.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm a native Californian and I grew up </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to yosemite,</v>

<v Speaker 3>using the public lands.</v>

63
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.510
<v Speaker 3>And so it was really important to me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

73
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.810

<v Speaker 3>he did it for awhile and then got out.</v>

76
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm not aware of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

82
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.990
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

<v Speaker 4>national park there.</v>

91

<v Speaker 4>I watched unforgiven.</v>

119
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 4>but the unforgiven is a dark movie man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's dark money.</v>

120
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.210
<v Speaker 4>William money killer of women and </v>
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>

121
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 4>That's a dark movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

122
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 4>Y'All got to come in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What he says in that,</v>

123
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:49.144
<v Speaker 4>when I learned that I'm just like </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably one of the most realistic </v>

124
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:52.234
<v Speaker 4>killers too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the way handled stuff and the way </v>

125
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 4>everybody else was like falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never saw that in those movies.</v>

126
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.300
<v Speaker 4>What was it about regret?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was about a,</v>

127
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 4>a life filled of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

128
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.323
<v Speaker 4>of regret and filled the things that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>did wrong that you wish you could have </v>

129
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.580
<v Speaker 4>done better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

130
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:09.723
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was sort of a last one last ride to </v>

131
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do something better for his kids,</v>

132
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that,</v>

133
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.610
<v Speaker 4>I think that was sort of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

134
00:05:16.611 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 4>it was sort of a final culmination of </v>
<v Speaker 4>all his westerns.</v>

135
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.223
<v Speaker 4>It really was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And almost like he updated the mall too </v>

136
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.020
<v Speaker 4>because like in the old movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you'd have cowards,</v>

137
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 4>you need to have heroes and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

138
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:31.700
<v Speaker 4>But in the unforgiven he took it to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>totally different level.</v>

139
00:05:31.701 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 4>Like psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

140
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:34.564
<v Speaker 4>like even the way he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the switch goes off when he starts </v>

141
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 4>drinking and then he started just </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking merch and everybody like the way</v>

142
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 4>it was handled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seemed so realistic the way everybody</v>

143
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 4>would fall apart and gunfights and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way you get to watch it again now.</v>

144
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 4>It's been awhile now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

145
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.240
<v Speaker 4>that sounds awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking great.</v>

146
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember seeing it.</v>

147
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.653
<v Speaker 4>I remember the movie I want to see in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the movie theater and when the credits </v>

148
00:05:57.471 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 4>roll at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

149
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.980
<v Speaker 3>just want to do this powerful one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

150
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 3>it's intense movie man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking intense.</v>

151
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 3>So when you're eight you figured it out </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that movie,</v>

152
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

153
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:11.444

<v Speaker 3>I remember watching it and I'm not sure </v>

154
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 3>if I watch it with him or shortly after </v>
<v Speaker 3>he had made it.</v>

155
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

167
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.310
<v Speaker 3>he's only had two wives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had a few,</v>

168
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.080
<v Speaker 3>few girlfriends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>few babies.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I did,</v>

171
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

172
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 3>I would bounce back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived with my mom.</v>

173
00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.940
<v Speaker 3>I live with my mom in California until I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was about a seven or eight.</v>

174
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.090
<v Speaker 3>And then I lived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we,</v>

175
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.963
<v Speaker 3>did she move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she packed up this kind of run the time </v>

176
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 3>when they split,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was your mom and actress to.</v>

177
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.710
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

178
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.931
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

179
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:10.550
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was just a normal person.</v>

180
00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flight attendant.</v>

181
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had two kids with my dad and uh,</v>

182
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

183
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.973
<v Speaker 3>she packed up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when they sort of split and she </v>

184
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:18.374
<v Speaker 3>moved to Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had lived there when she was a lot </v>

185
00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:21.764
<v Speaker 3>younger and so she had always loved </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hawaii and so I had gone to Hawaii to </v>

186
00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:26.054
<v Speaker 3>live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

187
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.170
<v Speaker 3>probably from about eight to about 16.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

188
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they ultimately moved back with</v>

189
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:36.410
<v Speaker 3>my dad for like the last couple of years</v>
<v Speaker 3>of high school.</v>

190
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.140
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

191
00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 3>it was an interesting upbringing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

192
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

193
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 3>one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was with my dad for some time and when</v>

194
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 3>I was in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a living there and you know,</v>

195
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 3>if you know anything about Hawaii as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a white boy growing up,</v>

196
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

197
00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:54.090
<v Speaker 3>you're the minority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

198
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:55.310
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a lot of,</v>

199
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:56.144
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of fist you just show up with a </v>

200
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:00.240
<v Speaker 3>Harley tee shirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rewarding.</v>

201
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

202
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

203
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people don't realize that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty,</v>

204
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:05.504
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hawaii's very from like a warrior </v>

205
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:09.940
<v Speaker 3>society still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

206
00:08:09.941 --> 00:08:12.290
<v Speaker 3>and that's a great thing kind of because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still,</v>

207
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.560
<v Speaker 3>it's very primal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

208
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:14.880
<v Speaker 3>and it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

209
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.400
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things where,</v>

210
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:17.503
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot of tolerance for </v>

211
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.970
<v Speaker 3>someone that you don't know or part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your family.</v>

212
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

213
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:26.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me it was,</v>

214
00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:27.080
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was tough.</v>

215
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

216
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Did they accept you eventually?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

217
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:31.550
<v Speaker 3>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sports,</v>

218
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.990
<v Speaker 3>sports really bridged that gap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A football.</v>

219
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 3>I played football and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that really.</v>

220
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.950
<v Speaker 3>It was tough because the first year they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>

221
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.090
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>

222
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.670
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck outta here.</v>

223
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.030
<v Speaker 3>Suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

224
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:47.781
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

225
00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:49.570
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid then I was probably,</v>

226
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:50.803
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember 10 or so playing pee </v>

227
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:53.714
<v Speaker 3>wee football.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

228
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.640
<v Speaker 3>And then as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

229
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.520
<v Speaker 3>as I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

230
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.570
<v Speaker 3>prove myself that I was down for hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>work and uh,</v>

231
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>down to throw hits that,</v>

232
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of,</v>

233
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:05.843
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bridged the gap and then ultimately </v>

234
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:12.260
<v Speaker 3>they were part of my team and then so we</v>
<v Speaker 3>would go to other schools and play other</v>

235
00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 3>schools and then I was still the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Halle boy to everybody else,</v>

236
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.090
<v Speaker 3>but they had my back now.</v>

237
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.680
<v Speaker 3>So that was cool to be a bizarre time </v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

238
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:25.050
<v Speaker 3>to be a 10 year old and all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 3>be in that environment.</v>

239
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.040
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

240
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:26.700
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

241
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.960
<v Speaker 3>it was different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was A.</v>

242
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.513
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know any better,</v>

243
00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

244
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 3>well this is what I got to deal with now</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the cards are got dealt,</v>

245
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:36.660
<v Speaker 3>so they're going to man up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

246
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:39.000
<v Speaker 3>I have a bunch of buddies live in Hawaii</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

247
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:41.380
<v Speaker 3>they say that if you're respectful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

248
00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:42.214
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not a Douche bag like after </v>

249
00:09:43.061 --> 00:09:45.030
<v Speaker 3>awhile you just fit right in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's cool with it.</v>

250
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

251
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.700
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

252
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.510
<v Speaker 3>I grew up also as a surfer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

253
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.413
<v Speaker 3>as grownups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grownups surfing and so there's </v>

254
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:53.274
<v Speaker 3>definitely a pecking order and a respect</v>
<v Speaker 3>there that you have to learn or you're </v>

255
00:09:56.851 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 3>going to learn the hard way.</v>

256
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

257
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.800
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was a good thing,</v>

258
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:02.634
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately because it kind of humbles </v>

259
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:07.020
<v Speaker 3>you and makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes you know your place,</v>

260
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.120
<v Speaker 3>which is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you start training Jujitsu there?</v>

261
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started,</v>

262
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.341
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

263
00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:17.580
<v Speaker 3>actually I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of my good buddies who passed away,</v>

264
00:10:17.581 --> 00:10:20.350
<v Speaker 3>Paul Walker got me into a Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

265
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.900
<v Speaker 3>he got me about six years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six maybe,</v>

266
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.230
<v Speaker 3>maybe more now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

267
00:10:25.231 --> 00:10:26.280
<v Speaker 3>He was like a purple belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

268
00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:28.710
<v Speaker 3>or a brown belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brown belt when he died.</v>

269
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so yeah,</v>

270
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:31.944
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

271
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was a diehard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he had a place in Hawaii actually</v>

272
00:10:35.331 --> 00:10:36.690
<v Speaker 3>and he had uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would,</v>

273
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.230
<v Speaker 3>he would go get matt and he would get </v>
<v Speaker 3>his place outfitted so he could practice</v>

274
00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:41.440
<v Speaker 3>at home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

275
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he got me,</v>

276
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.330
<v Speaker 3>he got me involved and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

277
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:48.090
<v Speaker 3>that's another thing that's great about </v>
<v Speaker 3>a over there.</v>

278
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like you really realize like </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

279
00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:53.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a jets is like the ultimate humbling,</v>

280
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.113
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people especially for I think for </v>

281
00:10:57.001 --> 00:10:59.710
<v Speaker 3>men carry a lot of ego around or carry a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of,</v>

282
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

283
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:04.110
<v Speaker 3>I think as men we're trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out who we are,</v>

284
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:04.944
<v Speaker 3>especially when we're young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really calms your ego down because </v>

285
00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:09.840
<v Speaker 3>you always know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

286
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to choke some people out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are going to choke me out.</v>

287
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.790
<v Speaker 3>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what level you're at,</v>

288
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.130
<v Speaker 3>you also get it out of your system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the one,</v>

289
00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.003
<v Speaker 3>the big part of what men do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they puff their chest up because they </v>

290
00:11:20.561 --> 00:11:23.430
<v Speaker 3>weren't prove themselves and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't yet and they don't know.</v>

291
00:11:23.431 --> 00:11:24.950
<v Speaker 3>And so they want to like put up this </v>
<v Speaker 3>air,</v>

292
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:27.540
<v Speaker 3>like there's some bad mother fucker </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're insecure,</v>

293
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.410
<v Speaker 3>they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once you've done it a bunch of times</v>

294
00:11:31.411 --> 00:11:33.540
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trained for a few years,</v>

295
00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:34.740
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all comes down.</v>

296
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You notice all the,</v>

297
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.290
<v Speaker 3>all the guys who do it consistently or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the high level guys,</v>

298
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.410
<v Speaker 3>just Socom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>socom.</v>

299
00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:44.790
<v Speaker 3>And that's actually one thing I noticed </v>
<v Speaker 3>about cameron too.</v>

300
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:45.803
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a calm motherfucker because he's </v>

301
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:53.290
<v Speaker 3>spends a lot of time out in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wilderness and I think that as a big,</v>

302
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

303
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:56.110
<v Speaker 3>with the world we live in now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

304
00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were.</v>

305
00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we talked about,</v>

306
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.250
<v Speaker 2>we talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

307
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.560
<v Speaker 2>some of the experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stressful experiences and the hard,</v>

308
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life here is never hard.</v>

309
00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Really the challenges we face in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular everyday traffic dude,</v>

310
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.210
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the line at starbucks is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that.</v>

311
00:12:14.211 --> 00:12:15.044
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hard.</v>

312
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So aside from that tough cam with a k,</v>

313
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.220
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so I mean it puts it in perspective,</v>

314
00:12:22.221 --> 00:12:23.750
<v Speaker 2>it's just Kinda like what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

315
00:12:23.751 --> 00:12:24.584
<v Speaker 2>you need to experiences like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just you kind of simulate those in </v>

316
00:12:27.081 --> 00:12:28.570
<v Speaker 2>training or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

317
00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.300
<v Speaker 2>the hunts that I do or the races that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>do and it keeps it in perspective so you</v>

318
00:12:32.301 --> 00:12:34.400
<v Speaker 2>don't get wound up over the little </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

319
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.263
<v Speaker 2>It's like no Biggie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like there's a humbling </v>

320
00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 2>just being in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

321
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.200
<v Speaker 2>You just realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh this,</v>

322
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.710
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't matter if I never existed </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

323
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:45.583
<v Speaker 2>like if human beings would never </v>
<v Speaker 2>invented these woods would be exactly </v>

324
00:12:48.321 --> 00:12:48.950
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

325
00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:49.783
<v Speaker 2>Now that I've thought about that a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been in the mountains and united </v>

326
00:12:52.311 --> 00:12:54.920
<v Speaker 2>say if something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>

327
00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:56.870
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you die for whatever reason,</v>

328
00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.540
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their changes and I oda,</v>

329
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like your existence doesn't even</v>

330
00:13:03.351 --> 00:13:08.090
<v Speaker 2>matter and I think we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we feel too self important sometimes.</v>

331
00:13:08.091 --> 00:13:08.924
<v Speaker 2>I think some people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in that situation and you're </v>

332
00:13:11.241 --> 00:13:12.500
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

333
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.450
<v Speaker 2>this I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

334
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing really.</v>

335
00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.630
<v Speaker 2>My friend Ryan Callahan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Ryan from firstlight?</v>

336
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.533

337
00:13:21.501 --> 00:13:23.240

339
00:13:26.361 --> 00:13:29.960
<v Speaker 2>something and they found a human skull </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

340
00:13:29.961 --> 00:13:31.250
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just,</v>

341
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.593
<v Speaker 2>just puts it all in perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like deep deep in the back country and </v>

342
00:13:35.961 --> 00:13:38.840
<v Speaker 2>you find a human skull and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

345
00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:45.140
<v Speaker 2>wrong and they just never really ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>found them.</v>

346
00:13:45.141 --> 00:13:47.600
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just happens to be a bear.</v>

347
00:13:47.601 --> 00:13:49.490

<v Speaker 2>could be a tricky one.</v>

348
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:50.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

349
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean lightening happens a lot to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

350
00:13:52.341 --> 00:13:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

351
00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.610
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

<v Speaker 3>Cameron about a,</v>

354
00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.640
<v Speaker 3>I've been here a lot of reading about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

355
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.920
<v Speaker 3>about like circadian rhythms and in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>inner body because a,</v>

356
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.900
<v Speaker 3>I've had chronic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sleepwalking chronic night terrors,</v>

357
00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since I was a little kid.</v>

358
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.233
<v Speaker 3>What does night terrors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the difference in night terrors </v>

359
00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:12.580
<v Speaker 3>and sleep parking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

360
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.170
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've had both.</v>

361
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.450
<v Speaker 3>So what is the night terrors?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Night terror would be,</v>

362
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.513
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>

363
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.020
<v Speaker 3>you wake up in the middle of night to </v>
<v Speaker 3>scream,</v>

364
00:14:20.021 --> 00:14:20.880
<v Speaker 3>yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

365
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:25.930
<v Speaker 3>that's in the middle of the bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

366
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they can sort of,</v>

367
00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:32.040
<v Speaker 3>I think they can coincide with </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleepwalking probably,</v>

368
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so stress related.</v>

369
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.230
<v Speaker 3>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

370
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.160
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to say I got him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

371
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.280
<v Speaker 3>when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I started getting them.</v>

372
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.440
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when I was about in sixth grade,</v>

373
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know if it was,</v>

374
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.370
<v Speaker 3>if it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a stress related or what it was,</v>

375
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.200
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I started getting them and then,</v>

376
00:14:50.201 --> 00:14:51.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

377
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.780
<v Speaker 3>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had them in 31 now.</v>

378
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.003
<v Speaker 3>And so I've been reading a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and I obviously listened to your </v>

379
00:14:58.341 --> 00:15:00.610
<v Speaker 3>podcast a lot about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

380
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:06.070
<v Speaker 3>just about the way humans are supposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to operate in the natural life cycle.</v>

381
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.660
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

382
00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.493
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wake up in the morning because it </v>

383
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:10.454
<v Speaker 3>gets light and you go to bed because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets dark and we're screwing it all up </v>

384
00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:18.680
<v Speaker 3>with the TVS and the phones and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the stuff.</v>

385
00:15:18.681 --> 00:15:19.514
<v Speaker 3>And anytime I've ever been willingness </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do a lot of backpacking and been a </v>

386
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:24.350
<v Speaker 3>lot of hunting trips and fishing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

387
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:29.830
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really calms my body down a lot.</v>

388
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.453
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they said was in all the reading </v>

389
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:35.000
<v Speaker 3>I've done is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that um,</v>

390
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:36.343
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your creation of Melatonin is in your </v>

391
00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:42.260
<v Speaker 3>optics because of assimilation of light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when it gets dark,</v>

392
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.123
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind supposed to create more </v>

393
00:15:44.181 --> 00:15:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Melatonin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which obviously puts you to sleep.</v>

394
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.260
<v Speaker 3>But because we don't have that or we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're manipulating that,</v>

395
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.090
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's changed everything.</v>

396
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.970
<v Speaker 5>That's why they invented ambien.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

397
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.520
<v Speaker 5>works great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

398
00:15:57.521 --> 00:15:58.354
<v Speaker 5>it's just a lot of people out there that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are taken pills that just knocked them </v>

399
00:16:01.121 --> 00:16:01.954
<v Speaker 5>out just nor to deal with the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're constantly surrounded by lights </v>

400
00:16:05.861 --> 00:16:06.694
<v Speaker 5>and staring at your phone before you go </v>
<v Speaker 5>to bed and watching TV and go to the </v>

401
00:16:09.521 --> 00:16:11.890
<v Speaker 5>bathroom and the light's bright.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your body doesn't know what that is.</v>

402
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.520
<v Speaker 5>And that's when we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>this yesterday.</v>

403
00:16:15.521 --> 00:16:16.480
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>

404
00:16:16.481 --> 00:16:17.314
<v Speaker 5>I've never been born at peace and </v>
<v Speaker 5>relaxed and slept as well as I have in </v>

405
00:16:21.341 --> 00:16:22.480
<v Speaker 5>the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

406
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.430
<v Speaker 5>once there's an adjustment period,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems like,</v>

407
00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.840
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But once I'm there,</v>

408
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:26.703
<v Speaker 5>it's just like I've never been at a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to make it sound like </v>

409
00:16:30.881 --> 00:16:33.730
<v Speaker 5>anything bad at home,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've never been more.</v>

410
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.770
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

411
00:16:35.771 --> 00:16:38.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's happy or just more </v>
<v Speaker 5>content content.</v>

412
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.710
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>More content than I am in the mountains.</v>

413
00:16:41.711 --> 00:16:45.100
<v Speaker 5>It feels like that's just natural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how it's supposed to be.</v>

414
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.173
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people really are supposed to interface </v>

415
00:16:47.801 --> 00:16:48.634
<v Speaker 5>with the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the wilderness the same way all </v>

416
00:16:50.891 --> 00:16:51.724
<v Speaker 5>animals are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've just created these weird </v>

417
00:16:52.871 --> 00:16:53.704
<v Speaker 5>structures over the past few thousand </v>
<v Speaker 5>years when you really think about </v>

418
00:16:55.901 --> 00:16:59.620
<v Speaker 5>civilization that we only figured out </v>
<v Speaker 5>how to talk 40,000 years ago,</v>

419
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>either we'll write.</v>

420
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:03.820
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

421
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

422
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.930
<v Speaker 5>I think the wheel is five.</v>
<v Speaker 5>10.</v>

423
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.890
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

424
00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.940
<v Speaker 5>it's a little little longer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At somewhere around 6,000 years ago.</v>

425
00:17:12.941 --> 00:17:16.190
<v Speaker 5>They figured out the wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is just hilarious with here's,</v>

426
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.890
<v Speaker 5>here's the best way to put that in </v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective.</v>

427
00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:18.863
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so let's say it's 50 slash 500 years </v>

428
00:17:20.321 --> 00:17:21.154
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's essentially a person lives to be </v>

429
00:17:23.261 --> 00:17:25.060
<v Speaker 5>100.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's 55 people.</v>

430
00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:28.360
<v Speaker 5>50th five people go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were just dragging shit around.</v>

431
00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.210
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's insane.</v>

432
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.430
<v Speaker 5>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

433
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.320
<v Speaker 5>People go and then before that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

434
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.620
<v Speaker 5>you just go back a few more people and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were grunting.</v>

435
00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:39.621
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they,</v>

436
00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:40.454
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they hadn't even figured out how to </v>

437
00:17:41.291 --> 00:17:43.850
<v Speaker 5>write things down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know it's really important</v>

438
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.070
<v Speaker 3>even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

439
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.903
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's even crazier to think about is </v>

440
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 3>how we've taken airplanes and perfected </v>
<v Speaker 3>that in the last</v>

441
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 4>50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

442
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.920
<v Speaker 4>before that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

443
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:54.870
<v Speaker 4>you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't just get on an airplane and</v>

444
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.330
<v Speaker 4>be anywhere in the world in 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

445
00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Parents 19.</v>

446
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:00.024
<v Speaker 4>Oh three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to hear the craziest fucking </v>

447
00:18:01.231 --> 00:18:02.100
<v Speaker 4>statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Emer.</v>

448
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:03.063
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Between the time that plane was </v>

449
00:18:05.131 --> 00:18:06.050
<v Speaker 4>invented,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

450
00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:06.884
<v Speaker 4>between the invention of the airplane </v>
<v Speaker 4>and someone dropping an atomic bomb out </v>

451
00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 4>of the airplane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was less than 50 years.</v>

452
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

453
00:18:13.711 --> 00:18:14.544
<v Speaker 4>What we do to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like somewhere like 44 years or </v>

454
00:18:18.781 --> 00:18:21.540
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Between the invention of the airplane by</v>

455
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:22.374
<v Speaker 4>the Wright brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first flight and then a bomb </v>

456
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.360
<v Speaker 4>dropping on Hiroshima.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

457
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.720
<v Speaker 4>And then now they're fast and furious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eight bombs wise plug.</v>

458
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.650
<v Speaker 4>There is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should go.</v>

459
00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.840
<v Speaker 4>Just totally unrelated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just thought of that.</v>

460
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.570
<v Speaker 4>How many of those have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

461
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.290
<v Speaker 4>this is the first one that I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the first one.</v>

462
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the eighth.</v>

463
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.560
<v Speaker 4>This will be the eighth one and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to do 10.</v>

464
00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:50.394
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're doing them back to back </v>

465
00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:51.940
<v Speaker 4>because what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't.</v>

466
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.830
<v Speaker 4>That's the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

467
00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:53.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

468
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vin,</v>

469

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

470
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.080
<v Speaker 4>the plan set.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean that's the whispers.</v>

471
00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:04.840
<v Speaker 4>I hear that we do a couple more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we have tended to be cool.</v>

472
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.990
<v Speaker 4>We made it this far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Might as well go to 10 right now.</v>

473
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:08.880
<v Speaker 4>Can you tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does your character survive?</v>

474
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:10.410
<v Speaker 4>Can you give us a spoiler alert?</v>

475
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.500
<v Speaker 4>I saw the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

476
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.353
<v Speaker 4>you can tell us then you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously if you didn't have to sign </v>

477
00:19:16.651 --> 00:19:17.484
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

479
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.070
<v Speaker 4>Scott had a big role.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

480
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.940
<v Speaker 4>it was cool because I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

481
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.650
<v Speaker 4>you never know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't,</v>

482
00:19:25.651 --> 00:19:26.880
<v Speaker 4>didn't ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't anything.</v>

483
00:19:26.881 --> 00:19:28.830
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's all over it the whole time.</v>

484
00:19:28.831 --> 00:19:29.990
<v Speaker 4>So it was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did a good job.</v>

485
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.640
<v Speaker 4>Let's just say it's a good one and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone will like it.</v>

486
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.500

<v Speaker 4>Ferrari and for that whole rivalry back </v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm actually getting a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting the opportunity to purchase a </v>

493
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.230
<v Speaker 4>one of the new GTS,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a coming out in 2017.</v>

494
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.720
<v Speaker 4>Really do that thing looks insane.</v>

495
00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.640
<v Speaker 4>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're making only 100 this year.</v>

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:03.970
<v Speaker 4>Punch I hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100.</v>

497
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.293
<v Speaker 4>One hundred and 7 billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna make 100 cars as </v>

498
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.850
<v Speaker 4>collectibles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well what so,</v>

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:12.090
<v Speaker 4>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

500
00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 4>how much do they charge for those?</v>
<v Speaker 4>For 100 bucks or 100 of them or.</v>

501
00:20:15.121 --> 00:20:18.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the price is about three.</v>

502
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.590
<v Speaker 4>Three slash 50.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three hundred $50,000 collected.</v>

503
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.650
<v Speaker 4>It's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that thing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>configure it.</v>

506
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:36.150

<v Speaker 4>Just bunch of teases forward.</v>

507
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.690
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing that doesn't even </v>
<v Speaker 4>look like a Ford?</v>

508
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean that looks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That looks like a Ford on planet Mars.</v>

509
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.210
<v Speaker 4>Change in the code that lets you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>crap.</v>

510
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:47.710
<v Speaker 4>It was better than a Ferrari.</v>

511
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:49.630
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That sounds bad.</v>

512
00:20:49.631 --> 00:20:51.400
<v Speaker 5>Ass Car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me see the.</v>

513
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.380
<v Speaker 5>See if you got some other angles on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there any other angles?</v>

514
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:59.370
<v Speaker 5>We'll look at a pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

515
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.400
<v Speaker 5>So cammo on reaper option.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>

516
00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:08.200
<v Speaker 5>Fucking God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

517
00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:11.050
<v Speaker 5>What a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I might get one to actually.</v>

518
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.930
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go for it dude.</v>

519
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.660
<v Speaker 5>Go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My whole life of a salary,</v>

520
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.793
<v Speaker 5>but that's $350,000.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But meanwhile the way they're making </v>

521
00:21:22.751 --> 00:21:24.910
<v Speaker 5>cars today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that thing is going to be insane.</v>

522
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:29.080
<v Speaker 5>But that'll be like a piece of art.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know that that will be,</v>

523
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the GTA,</v>

524
00:21:30.891 --> 00:21:34.240
<v Speaker 5>knowing the older gts that have gone up </v>
<v Speaker 5>in value because they just don't,</v>

525
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to say that.</v>

526
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 5>What about new cars though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So much plastic and stuff.</v>

527
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:41.860
<v Speaker 5>They just don't seem to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People don't want them.</v>

528
00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.560
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you get a 19 sixties car,</v>

529
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.990
<v Speaker 5>it's worth a shitload of money today.</v>

530
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.830
<v Speaker 5>But in the 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>current worth shit.</v>

531
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.183
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's no classics from </v>

532
00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:55.500
<v Speaker 5>Nineteen Ninety is a couple Porsha's </v>
<v Speaker 5>like 99,</v>

533
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:59.830
<v Speaker 5>six floors from the nineties or the last</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the air cooled cars.</v>

534
00:21:59.831 --> 00:22:01.870
<v Speaker 5>They're still worth some money there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're classics,</v>

535
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.943
<v Speaker 5>but that's kind of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe a few classic Ferrari's from </v>

536
00:22:05.621 --> 00:22:08.080
<v Speaker 5>that day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like a Camaro from 1990.</v>

537
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:13.300
<v Speaker 5>Push that thing off a cliff and shoot at</v>
<v Speaker 5>it while it's on its way down.</v>

538
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.640
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't let your girl drive that car.</v>

539
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.190
<v Speaker 5>She got issues were saying before she </v>
<v Speaker 5>crashes things.</v>

540
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:23.260
<v Speaker 5>A little bit of a history of a long </v>
<v Speaker 5>history.</v>

541
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.470
<v Speaker 5>Let's leave it at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

542
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.530
<v Speaker 5>people can't be great at everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

543
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:30.430
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen the new Acura Nsx?</v>

544
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.290
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

545
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.940
<v Speaker 5>Look at this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie.</v>

546
00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:35.320
<v Speaker 5>Pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're into cars,</v>

547
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>accurate built the last Nsx in 2005.</v>

548
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:43.980
<v Speaker 5>So there's like 12 years off before the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they came out with a new one,</v>

549
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:45.300
<v Speaker 5>they just came up with a new one this </v>
<v Speaker 5>year.</v>

550
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:49.250
<v Speaker 5>It's just this spaceship,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this monster,</v>

551
00:22:49.251 --> 00:22:50.900
<v Speaker 5>a spaceships.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll find a silver one.</v>

552
00:22:50.901 --> 00:22:55.020
<v Speaker 5>So I that when they do that with cars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they sort of wait a long time to get,</v>

553
00:22:55.021 --> 00:22:57.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come up with a whole new concept.</v>

554
00:22:57.131 --> 00:23:00.150
<v Speaker 5>Not just a every three or four years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Four wheel drive.</v>

555
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>totally.</v>

556
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:01.661
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

557
00:23:01.661 --> 00:23:06.580
<v Speaker 5>I like it to four wheel drive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>electric wheels on the front.</v>

558
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.240
<v Speaker 5>It's at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's tough looking at that one.</v>

559
00:23:10.241 --> 00:23:12.940
<v Speaker 5>After the Ford is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's not a good angle.</v>

560
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.860
<v Speaker 5>Same Angle here with Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but no,</v>

561
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.300
<v Speaker 5>love that for.</v>

565
00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.370
<v Speaker 5>upper left hand side right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

<v Speaker 5>When you see one in real life,</v>

568
00:23:34.301 --> 00:23:36.460
<v Speaker 5>it looks like a spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really does.</v>

569
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>ma'am.</v>

571
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.550

574
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:47.940
<v Speaker 5>that looks as good but not as good as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>four?</v>

575
00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.300
<v Speaker 5>Does it pretty close?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

576
00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:51.134
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's got different tastes </v>

577
00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:52.634
<v Speaker 5>campaigns.</v>

578
00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:57.723
<v Speaker 5>I just can't wait for the self driving </v>
<v Speaker 5>because people just are terrible </v>

579
00:24:00.681 --> 00:24:02.180
<v Speaker 5>drivers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's just,</v>

580
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:04.430
<v Speaker 5>let's just get on with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've figured that out.</v>

581
00:24:04.431 --> 00:24:06.110
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's talking about these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 5>cars.</v>

582
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:08.150
<v Speaker 5>Well that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just let him be self taught or you know,</v>

583
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.490
<v Speaker 5>that's not going to be self driving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll be ridiculous.</v>

584
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:12.890
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if you have a car like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a Ford gt,</v>

585
00:24:12.891 --> 00:24:15.860
<v Speaker 5>but it's self driving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unless you're on a race track,</v>

586
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.850
<v Speaker 5>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what am I going to live on a race track?</v>

587
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.793
<v Speaker 5>So stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something that happening as </v>

588
00:24:21.711 --> 00:24:22.544
<v Speaker 5>we're making things autonomous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to lose a little bit of </v>

589
00:24:24.621 --> 00:24:25.640
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure,</v>

590
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.593
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sort of the one of the reasons why </v>

591
00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:28.034
<v Speaker 5>people like handmade stuff now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you'd get a pair of handmade boots </v>

592
00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:31.300
<v Speaker 5>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

593
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.420
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it feels different.</v>

594
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:33.703
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got,</v>

595
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.520
<v Speaker 5>these are handmade.</v>

596
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.520
<v Speaker 5>Lou Casey's Casey's handmade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know me like 11 days to do,</v>

597
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:43.260
<v Speaker 5>to do from start to finish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

598
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.710
<v Speaker 5>not the lettering and stuff they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they do at different stages,</v>

599
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:46.993
<v Speaker 5>but I mean they're the best place in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>market and it doesn't that feel </v>

600
00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:50.030
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you have them,</v>

601
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.950
<v Speaker 5>like there's something knowing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>person made it too.</v>

602
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.590
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well they're just so comfortable.</v>

603
00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:55.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I made cowboy boots.</v>

604
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.070
<v Speaker 5>Cowboy boots normally aren't that </v>
<v Speaker 5>comfortable,</v>

605
00:24:58.071 --> 00:25:00.550
<v Speaker 5>but those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what my boots were yesterday too.</v>

606
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.230
<v Speaker 5>So Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was reading this podcast,</v>

607
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:06.270
<v Speaker 5>reading a podcast or listening to </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcasts,</v>

608
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:11.380
<v Speaker 5>listening to a book about a horseback </v>
<v Speaker 5>riding,</v>

609
00:25:11.781 --> 00:25:12.614
<v Speaker 5>and this guy was explaining how people </v>
<v Speaker 5>try to wear like hiking boots when they </v>

610
00:25:16.071 --> 00:25:17.840
<v Speaker 5>go horseback riding and they jam their </v>
<v Speaker 5>fruit.</v>

611
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:18.973
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a reason why cowboy boots fall </v>

612
00:25:20.421 --> 00:25:21.254
<v Speaker 5>off so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so you don't get dragged behind a </v>

613
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:25.730
<v Speaker 5>frightened horse like it's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>happen that way.</v>

614
00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.310
<v Speaker 5>That's why they're pointed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they slide in and slide out.</v>

615
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.980
<v Speaker 5>They slide in and slide out and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>slip right off your feet.</v>

616
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.843
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

617
00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:33.380
<v Speaker 5>And you have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get a good pair of these.</v>

618
00:25:33.381 --> 00:25:36.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean they'll last 10,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 and it lasts a lifetime.</v>

619
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:37.430
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could.</v>

620
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 5>I just bought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got my,</v>

621

00:28:44.521 --> 00:28:46.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I necessarily knew I </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to be an actor.</v>

701
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.840
<v Speaker 4>I think as I get older I realize it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>more about telling stories.</v>

702
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:54.750
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just sort of fell into the acting.</v>

703
00:28:54.751 --> 00:28:55.201
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

704
00:28:55.201 --> 00:28:57.570
<v Speaker 4>well this could be a way I could get in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could,</v>

705
00:28:58.170 --> 00:28:59.003
<v Speaker 4>I could go into that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just enjoy the entertainment </v>

706
00:29:01.021 --> 00:29:01.854
<v Speaker 4>process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like creating something that people are </v>

707
00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.350
<v Speaker 4>entertained by and enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

708
00:29:04.351 --> 00:29:05.184
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Telling a story that people can relate </v>

709
00:29:07.261 --> 00:29:08.160
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>laugh,</v>

710
00:29:08.161 --> 00:29:09.090
<v Speaker 4>cry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

711
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:09.983
<v Speaker 4>Do you think you'll go the route of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>dad and maybe do some directing and </v>

712
00:29:12.961 --> 00:29:15.900
<v Speaker 4>writing things on the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the plan.</v>

713
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:17.500
<v Speaker 4>That's the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

714
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.830
<v Speaker 4>taking control of your own career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

715
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:21.850
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is good.</v>

716
00:29:21.851 --> 00:29:23.510
<v Speaker 4>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

717
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:24.403
<v Speaker 4>you tell the stories you want to tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we were talking about this before </v>

718
00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:27.264
<v Speaker 4>the podcast that the world of the actor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult and a lot of people </v>

719
00:29:30.031 --> 00:29:30.864
<v Speaker 4>like accused actors of being fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think one of the reasons for </v>

720
00:29:34.111 --> 00:29:35.290
<v Speaker 4>narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

721
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:36.663
<v Speaker 4>that for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of the reasons for the accusing </v>

722
00:29:38.611 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 4>them of being fake is that they always </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to put on</v>

723
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:42.963
<v Speaker 5>the best show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like as far as their behavior and the </v>

724
00:29:44.891 --> 00:29:45.724
<v Speaker 5>way they act and think and their </v>
<v Speaker 5>opinions because they're constantly </v>

725
00:29:47.441 --> 00:29:51.520
<v Speaker 5>trying to get cast in things and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>all about getting people to like you and</v>

726
00:29:51.521 --> 00:29:52.780
<v Speaker 5>politicking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

727
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:53.763
<v Speaker 5>and we were talking also about like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you kinda have to have liberal </v>

728
00:29:56.381 --> 00:30:01.180
<v Speaker 5>sensibilities like in this town if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you are a right going together,</v>

729
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.420
<v Speaker 5>does that even make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like they contradict each other</v>

730
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.570
<v Speaker 5>a liberal sensibilities as well.</v>

731
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:09.730
<v Speaker 3>The reason I moved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

732
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.030
<v Speaker 3>moved out to La is,</v>

746
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.180
<v Speaker 5>And everyone's always.</v>

747
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:40.493
<v Speaker 3>I always judge it when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I meet somebody and I'm having a </v>

748
00:30:42.121 --> 00:30:44.220
<v Speaker 3>conversation with them and I asked how </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing,</v>

749
00:30:44.221 --> 00:30:45.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meet an actor or something.</v>

750
00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.960
<v Speaker 3>How have you been working on a cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

751
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.880
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times they're just waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 3>their turn to talk.</v>

752
00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.150
<v Speaker 3>You're not even listening to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just sort of,</v>

753
00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:53.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you,</v>

754
00:30:53.991 --> 00:30:55.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to return that and say</v>

755
00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.850
<v Speaker 3>hello,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

756
00:30:56.851 --> 00:30:57.684
<v Speaker 3>What you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>

757
00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:58.603
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't feel like it's sincere </v>

758
00:31:00.081 --> 00:31:00.914
<v Speaker 5>conversation?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

759
00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.610
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not at all.</v>

760
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:02.443
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a big issue with people in </v>

761
00:31:03.651 --> 00:31:05.540
<v Speaker 5>general.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But in la it's,</v>

762
00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:09.860
<v Speaker 5>I think this is the magnet for all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>narcissists and all the people that want</v>

763
00:31:09.861 --> 00:31:12.260
<v Speaker 5>attention and the people that have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole,</v>

764
00:31:12.261 --> 00:31:13.094
<v Speaker 5>they have a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they need to fill up for whatever their </v>

765
00:31:15.141 --> 00:31:16.370
<v Speaker 5>childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

766
00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.140
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they,</v>

767
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:22.520
<v Speaker 5>they gravitate here and then they just </v>
<v Speaker 5>communicate with each other the same way</v>

768
00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:26.120
<v Speaker 5>and everybody kinda like pretends to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone who they're not.</v>

769
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.283
<v Speaker 5>And then hopefully they make it and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>once they make it then they just become </v>

770
00:31:31.101 --> 00:31:32.650
<v Speaker 5>some fucking Weirdo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>

771
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:33.703
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's weird how many of them are like </v>

772
00:31:35.121 --> 00:31:36.410
<v Speaker 5>almost like cookie cutter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

773
00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.240
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've met that guy before.</v>

774
00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:41.030
<v Speaker 5>He just looked different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

775
00:31:41.031 --> 00:31:41.864
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like the same person living a </v>

776
00:31:43.671 --> 00:31:44.390
<v Speaker 5>different life.</v>

777
00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:49.390
<v Speaker 5>I know this assembly line before they </v>
<v Speaker 5>fell asleep or something,</v>

778
00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:52.243
<v Speaker 5>but the actor world is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've met a lot of comedians that are </v>

779
00:31:54.411 --> 00:31:55.430
<v Speaker 5>similar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there are a lot.</v>

780
00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.830
<v Speaker 5>They're very so much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the actors,</v>

781
00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.200
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot that are super similar.</v>

782
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.870
<v Speaker 5>Just a lot of you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then again,</v>

783
00:32:02.871 --> 00:32:03.704
<v Speaker 5>you'll meet some of them who've like </v>
<v Speaker 5>figured it out and made it through and </v>

784
00:32:05.571 --> 00:32:06.404
<v Speaker 5>they're super normal and real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Adam Sandler is one of the nicest </v>

785

<v Speaker 5>guys you've ever met.</v>

787
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.553
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you didn't know he was Adam </v>

788
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:16.270
<v Speaker 5>Sandler and you met him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you said super normal.</v>

792
00:32:22.251 --> 00:32:23.480
<v Speaker 5>That's what people say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

793
00:32:23.481 --> 00:32:24.710
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they asked me,</v>

794
00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:26.060
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how's Scott?</v>

795
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:27.920
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seems normal.</v>

796
00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:28.970
<v Speaker 5>So that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why.</v>

797
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:34.690
<v Speaker 5>So you must not know me yet because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>actor is like,</v>

798
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:39.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who am I to say who's </v>
<v Speaker 5>normal?</v>

799
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.960
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But to me it seems like a normal guy.</v>

800
00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:44.480
<v Speaker 5>And you said Adam Sandler over </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely normal.</v>

801
00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:49.100
<v Speaker 5>So that's Kinda puts it in perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My normal is like the,</v>

802
00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:50.720
<v Speaker 5>you could talk to them and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

803
00:32:50.721 --> 00:32:52.150
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're real sincere.</v>

804
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:53.683
<v Speaker 5>The president president having a real </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation with you and there's a lot </v>

805
00:32:56.691 --> 00:32:57.524
<v Speaker 5>of people that just don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You talked to them and they're just </v>

806
00:32:59.121 --> 00:32:59.954
<v Speaker 5>putting on some.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He definitely no trust people who are </v>

807
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.450
<v Speaker 5>too nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

808
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:08.510
<v Speaker 5>why are they so nice like this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This isn't right.</v>

809
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.260
<v Speaker 5>It's just a tough world for these people</v>
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>

810
00:33:12.261 --> 00:33:14.150
<v Speaker 5>especially with the ones that haven't </v>
<v Speaker 5>made it out here.</v>

811
00:33:14.151 --> 00:33:14.984
<v Speaker 5>It's so psychologically devastating </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're constantly going on </v>

812
00:33:17.541 --> 00:33:20.480
<v Speaker 5>auditions and you constantly getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>rejected so you're insecure in the first</v>

813
00:33:20.481 --> 00:33:21.314
<v Speaker 5>place and then you are hoping someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>likes you so you'd go to this thing and </v>

814
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:28.950
<v Speaker 5>you're kind of like putting on your best</v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior and you're dressing good.</v>

815
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:31.220
<v Speaker 5>Like hi,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

820

<v Speaker 5>audition.</v>

821
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.710
<v Speaker 5>I didn't suck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

822
00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:43.280
<v Speaker 5>they just really didn't like you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They said you didn't make eye contact.</v>

823
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:47.300
<v Speaker 5>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People get weirder and weirder.</v>

824
00:33:47.301 --> 00:33:49.910
<v Speaker 5>And if you meet an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say like,</v>

825
00:33:49.911 --> 00:33:50.744
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like one year and then you meet them 10 </v>

826
00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:54.410
<v Speaker 5>years later and they're still swinging </v>
<v Speaker 5>and nothing's happening.</v>

827
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.920
<v Speaker 5>They might be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost ready to crack.</v>

828
00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.013
<v Speaker 5>Like right at that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>falling down with that Michael Douglas </v>

829
00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.180
<v Speaker 5>when he's fucking and he's got the </v>
<v Speaker 5>briefcase and he goes and traffic starts</v>

830
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:08.080
<v Speaker 5>shooting people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a couple of days before the.</v>

831
00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:11.510
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take it anymore.</v>

832
00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.100
<v Speaker 5>It's a fucking devastating business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

833
00:34:14.410 --> 00:34:15.550
<v Speaker 4>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's tough.</v>

834
00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.620
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

835
00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:20.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean we were talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

836
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:21.693
<v Speaker 4>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all built on hard work and your </v>

837
00:34:24.461 --> 00:34:25.420
<v Speaker 4>reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

838
00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:26.660
<v Speaker 4>Because like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

839
00:34:26.661 --> 00:34:29.150
<v Speaker 4>and you can get a reputation for being </v>
<v Speaker 4>an asshole or,</v>

840
00:34:29.151 --> 00:34:32.140
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>showing up late to work or this down the</v>

841
00:34:32.141 --> 00:34:33.980
<v Speaker 4>other and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's gonna know about it.</v>

842
00:34:33.981 --> 00:34:37.150
<v Speaker 4>So it's a small place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>La or being a diva in a diva.</v>

843
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.621
<v Speaker 5>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

844
00:34:38.621 --> 00:34:41.100
<v Speaker 5>That's not a good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not a good additive for.</v>

845
00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.430
<v Speaker 5>Can't shake that one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

846
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:44.590
<v Speaker 5>That happens to people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like in Hollywood,</v>

847
00:34:44.591 --> 00:34:46.780
<v Speaker 5>they'll be doing a lot of big movies and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you hear like,</v>

848
00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:48.580
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's difficult to work with.</v>

849
00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.060
<v Speaker 5>They just fucking disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

850
00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:53.663
<v Speaker 5>And it's almost seems like Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 5>delights and shutting those people out </v>

851
00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:57.550
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're written for you to fail.</v>

852
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:58.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They kinda.</v>

853
00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.063
<v Speaker 5>But one you prove to be like ungrateful </v>
<v Speaker 5>in some way or like here's a perfect </v>

854
00:35:05.321 --> 00:35:07.300
<v Speaker 5>example where he kind of made it on </v>
<v Speaker 5>television,</v>

855
00:35:07.301 --> 00:35:08.134
<v Speaker 5>but you remember David Caruso when David</v>
<v Speaker 5>Caruso was on Nyp de blue and what he </v>

856
00:35:11.551 --> 00:35:12.071
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

857
00:35:12.071 --> 00:35:15.760
<v Speaker 5>this guy's a great actor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he quit and ypd blue and it was</v>

858
00:35:15.761 --> 00:35:16.594
<v Speaker 5>this massive hit show and then went and </v>
<v Speaker 5>started doing like some real shitty </v>

859
00:35:20.831 --> 00:35:21.664
<v Speaker 5>movies and everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why the fuck would you quit a big show </v>

860
00:35:24.581 --> 00:35:26.920
<v Speaker 5>like Nyp de blue and do a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>movies.</v>

861
00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.000
<v Speaker 5>Like boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hope he fails.</v>

862
00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.160
<v Speaker 5>And then the movies failed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then everybody's like,</v>

863
00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:34.620
<v Speaker 5>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then never did a movie again.</v>

864
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:35.463
<v Speaker 5>You never saw him in a good mood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he like had this of this amazing </v>

865
00:35:38.251 --> 00:35:39.090
<v Speaker 5>career.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

866
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.013
<v Speaker 5>Danny became this caricature because </v>
<v Speaker 5>then he was doing that stupid cop show </v>

867
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:47.280
<v Speaker 5>where we take his glasses off and say </v>
<v Speaker 5>some stupid pun.</v>

868
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.140
<v Speaker 5>Well it looks like he got nailed in your</v>
<v Speaker 5>tickets.</v>

869
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:51.923
<v Speaker 5>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like CSI Miami or something like </v>

870
00:35:54.211 --> 00:35:57.900
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was a fucking caricature of a cop</v>

871
00:35:57.901 --> 00:35:58.734
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas nyt PD blue when he was on it </v>

872
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.180
<v Speaker 5>was groundbreaking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

873
00:36:03.181 --> 00:36:05.340
<v Speaker 5>it was fucking fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what happened?</v>

874
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:07.820
<v Speaker 5>It just became an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

875
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:11.280
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who he is being recognized </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a diva,</v>

876
00:36:11.281 --> 00:36:13.920
<v Speaker 5>whether or not he was actually a diva.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the guy,</v>

877
00:36:13.921 --> 00:36:15.670
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to meet him and talk to them </v>
<v Speaker 5>and hang out with them,</v>

878
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:19.710
<v Speaker 5>but he had that stink and you get that </v>
<v Speaker 5>steak on it.</v>

879
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.870
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it's not even,</v>

880
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:22.723
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Hollywood is not even what's true </v>

881
00:36:23.761 --> 00:36:25.500
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's just perceived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

882
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:28.080
<v Speaker 3>it's [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad used to always say he say,</v>

883
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe half of what you see and none of</v>

884
00:36:30.561 --> 00:36:32.190
<v Speaker 3>what you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

885
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.140
<v Speaker 3>and that always stuck with me because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

886
00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:37.850
<v Speaker 3>you sit down with people in the industry</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever and you just hear,</v>

887
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.230
<v Speaker 3>know a lot of Hollywood gossip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

888
00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:41.064
<v Speaker 3>It's a full of gossip queens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wants to talk shit about </v>

889
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.720
<v Speaker 3>someone they worked with or tell some </v>
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>

890
00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.120
<v Speaker 3>tell how difficult somebody was or this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

891
00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.610
<v Speaker 3>And you don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

892
00:36:50.611 --> 00:36:53.370
<v Speaker 3>it's a business built on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

893
00:36:53.371 --> 00:36:55.290
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a house of cards,</v>

894
00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.251
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

895
00:36:56.251 --> 00:36:58.320
<v Speaker 3>well that how didn't even know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's even true,</v>

896
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's Kinda fucked up.</v>

897
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.260
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

898
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:03.103
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like that happens in other </v>

899
00:37:04.051 --> 00:37:05.010
<v Speaker 3>businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but may,</v>

900
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.300
<v Speaker 3>May.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it does with coworkers.</v>

901
00:37:06.301 --> 00:37:06.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

902
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:07.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it does.</v>

903
00:37:07.641 --> 00:37:08.474
<v Speaker 5>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a weird thing because when </v>

904
00:37:10.401 --> 00:37:13.910
<v Speaker 5>you're a movie star like yourself in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're on the screen,</v>

905
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:16.850
<v Speaker 5>like you get all the adulation and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>the love.</v>

906
00:37:16.851 --> 00:37:19.070
<v Speaker 5>There's a whole crew of people behind </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

907
00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:24.640
<v Speaker 5>This special effects people and lighting</v>
<v Speaker 5>and sound and its directors and Jamie,</v>

908
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:26.953
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie is 100 people to everyone that's </v>

909
00:37:31.581 --> 00:37:32.530
<v Speaker 5>on the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

910
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:35.210
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they get no love,</v>

911
00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:36.973
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get no,</v>

912
00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:38.043
<v Speaker 3>they're going to 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where the business side of </v>

913
00:37:39.921 --> 00:37:40.754
<v Speaker 3>the businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So delusion because the agents and the </v>

914
00:37:43.191 --> 00:37:44.024
<v Speaker 3>people around us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not the ones they're putting in </v>

915
00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:50.870
<v Speaker 3>the sweat every day for five months to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a film,</v>

916
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulling the creative ideas,</v>

917
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:54.590
<v Speaker 3>pulling the hard work.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the grips and all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the guys who are underpaid in or you</v>

920
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.360

<v Speaker 3>working just to make money to feed their</v>

921
00:38:02.361 --> 00:38:03.550
<v Speaker 3>families.</v>

<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the business.</v>

931
00:38:28.641 --> 00:38:30.510
<v Speaker 3>There's so much other stuff that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>never.</v>

932
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:32.930
<v Speaker 3>The people never get love for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the film industry.</v>

933
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:34.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well the long hours.</v>

934
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 5>That's another thing that people don't</v>

935
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.750
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're on a film set,</v>

936
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:42.010
<v Speaker 4>like what's an average day for you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be a short days of 12 hour day.</v>

937
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:46.020
<v Speaker 4>So it's 12 to 16.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how many days a week you work in?</v>

938
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:46.931
<v Speaker 4>Five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Six.</v>

939
00:38:46.931 --> 00:38:48.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're on location,</v>

940
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:52.630
<v Speaker 4>you're usually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can be in a movie that's doing a six</v>

941
00:38:52.631 --> 00:38:54.640
<v Speaker 4>day work week or you could be doing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>five day,</v>

942
00:38:54.641 --> 00:38:57.970
<v Speaker 4>but by the end everyone's doing a six </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes even,</v>

943
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:59.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just putting in full.</v>

944
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.090
<v Speaker 4>You're full throttle to get the movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>

945
00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:02.043
<v Speaker 4>Now when you're on location,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you have to squeeze a workout in to </v>

946
00:39:04.901 --> 00:39:06.040
<v Speaker 4>keep your brain?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

947
00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:06.931
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

948
00:39:06.931 --> 00:39:09.010
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you do that in a 16 hour day?</v>

949
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.540
<v Speaker 4>I try to do it during lunch because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>find that if you go to lunch,</v>

950
00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:14.713
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get sluggish after lunch and then </v>

951
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:18.580
<v Speaker 4>you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>

952
00:39:18.581 --> 00:39:21.040
<v Speaker 4>I got to get back in there and do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta now.</v>

953
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:21.874
<v Speaker 4>I gotta hit the coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get hit the whatever to get </v>

954
00:39:23.381 --> 00:39:25.750
<v Speaker 4>stimulated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're saying.</v>

955
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:32.460
<v Speaker 4>Are you a math guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or mostly just a bumpy get the history.</v>

956
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.910
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

957
00:39:36.911 --> 00:39:37.744
<v Speaker 4>so I think working out during lunch it </v>
<v Speaker 4>seems to be the best thing for me </v>

958
00:39:40.331 --> 00:39:44.050
<v Speaker 4>because I don't do well in the mornings </v>
<v Speaker 4>for workout because I feel stiff.</v>

959
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:48.070
<v Speaker 4>So I like to get the blood going first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I could hit it during lunch,</v>

960
00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if I'm on set I'll do whatever,</v>

961
00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:51.311
<v Speaker 4>dumbbells,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

962
00:39:51.311 --> 00:39:53.080
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the other and then I'll have,</v>

963
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:55.720
<v Speaker 4>I'll get some endorphins kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

964
00:39:55.721 --> 00:39:58.270
<v Speaker 4>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to do that too.</v>

965
00:39:58.271 --> 00:40:01.450
<v Speaker 4>But now lately over the last,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like not even lately,</v>

966
00:40:01.451 --> 00:40:03.940
<v Speaker 4>but over the last like five or six years</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to get up.</v>

967
00:40:03.941 --> 00:40:04.774
<v Speaker 4>And the first thing I do work out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially like if I was doing Jujitsu </v>

968
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:11.200
<v Speaker 4>in the afternoon and I needed to do a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifting session,</v>

969
00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:12.483
<v Speaker 4>I want as much space between the lifting</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the Jujitsu is possible so I can </v>

970
00:40:15.701 --> 00:40:16.510
<v Speaker 4>recover.</v>

971
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:20.110
<v Speaker 4>So for me it's like just get up and even</v>
<v Speaker 4>though I don't feel good in the morning,</v>

972
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.480
<v Speaker 4>once the blood starts pumping and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sweat,</v>

973
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.740
<v Speaker 4>you got to just remind yourself like </v>
<v Speaker 4>does A.</v>

974
00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:25.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you feel like shit.</v>

975
00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:29.380
<v Speaker 4>Just do the few reps get that blood </v>
<v Speaker 4>going and then once,</v>

976
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.170
<v Speaker 4>once you're sweating you're sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all the same,</v>

977
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.300
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seems to be.</v>

978
00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:34.143
<v Speaker 4>I do not do in the morning too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I worked out this morning and plus </v>

979
00:40:36.011 --> 00:40:36.844
<v Speaker 4>math,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just that that helps me feel the </v>

980
00:40:38.351 --> 00:40:40.330
<v Speaker 4>same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in the movie,</v>

981
00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.820
<v Speaker 4>fast eight made a lot of sleeveless </v>
<v Speaker 4>shirts,</v>

982
00:40:42.821 --> 00:40:44.230
<v Speaker 4>which I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's awesome.</v>

983
00:40:44.231 --> 00:40:46.990
<v Speaker 4>You're a big fan of the other big fan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I slipped me a DM.</v>

984
00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:54.190
<v Speaker 4>Stuff going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure about the connection.</v>

985
00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.680
<v Speaker 4>He's confused right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just know what we're talking about it.</v>

986
00:40:56.681 --> 00:41:00.580
<v Speaker 4>But he'll press on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So do those guys.</v>

987
00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.460
<v Speaker 4>So rock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>state them,</v>

988
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.410
<v Speaker 4>mother to do we have to do pushups in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there to keep that pump for the,</v>

989
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.120
<v Speaker 4>for the scenes to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very good question.</v>

990
00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.860
<v Speaker 4>Look everybody's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

991
00:41:08.861 --> 00:41:10.560
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody wants to be on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the,</v>

992
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:11.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the tip of the spear.</v>

993
00:41:11.651 --> 00:41:13.570
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you got shirt off,</v>

994
00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:14.770
<v Speaker 4>tank off stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's,</v>

995
00:41:14.771 --> 00:41:16.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's get the pump on.</v>

996
00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:19.150
<v Speaker 4>That's where a guy like me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm very,</v>

997
00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:21.220
<v Speaker 4>very modest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if I was there,</v>

998
00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:24.200
<v Speaker 4>I would be the opposite with your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tight muscle barriers.</v>

999
00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:29.410
<v Speaker 4>I would try to slump maybe perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or hide my definition.</v>

1000
00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:32.820
<v Speaker 4>One of the first thing I noticed when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>walked out,</v>

1001
00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:33.381
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1002
00:41:33.381 --> 00:41:34.730
<v Speaker 4>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He really works on his posture.</v>

1003
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.100
<v Speaker 4>I do do a lot of yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do a lot of yoga.</v>

1004
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:38.730
<v Speaker 4>Very good posture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You notice this cam,</v>

1005
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:39.770
<v Speaker 4>you don't even notice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bro.</v>

1006
00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.890
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't even my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never commented on my posture.</v>

1007
00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:43.983
<v Speaker 4>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was one of one of the first things </v>

1008
00:41:45.801 --> 00:41:47.780
<v Speaker 4>when I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I got to yoga about 10 years ago</v>

1009
00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.090
<v Speaker 4>and it's changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing,</v>

1010
00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:51.410
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It changed my life.</v>

1011
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.230
<v Speaker 4>No pumping yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no pump at yoga.</v>

1012
00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.073
<v Speaker 4>We've just got to Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sleeveless shirts and getting this </v>

1013
00:41:57.681 --> 00:42:01.510
<v Speaker 4>pump on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't like touching his toes and so</v>

1014
00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.980
<v Speaker 4>that's a struggle I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can do this.</v>

1015
00:42:03.981 --> 00:42:05.110
<v Speaker 4>So knees bent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1016
00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:06.533
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the one of the first thing a </v>

1017
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:11.210
<v Speaker 4>guy told me when I was getting into it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

1018
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.010
<v Speaker 4>you really got to work on your posture.</v>

1019
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.910
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna.</v>

1020

<v Speaker 4>slumped over.</v>

1023
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:20.810
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you want to be like that?</v>

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it Kinda got me quick.</v>

1025

1028
00:42:29.931 --> 00:42:30.764
<v Speaker 4>I would've said worry about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm used to getting critiqued on </v>

1029
00:42:35.581 --> 00:42:37.880
<v Speaker 4>line and so maybe I'm just a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>defensive.</v>

1030
00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.153
<v Speaker 4>Well these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these seats that we're sitting in or </v>

<v Speaker 4>and stuff like that.</v>

1046
00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:21.710
<v Speaker 4>Everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just,</v>

1047
00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:25.670
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for people because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessarily fun,</v>

1048
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:28.940
<v Speaker 4>like the results are excellent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why you're there and you're sweating</v>

1049
00:43:28.941 --> 00:43:32.240
<v Speaker 4>your dick off and you're stretching and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to quiet your mind.</v>

1050
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:33.103
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the hardest thing for </v>

1051
00:43:34.401 --> 00:43:34.941
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1052
00:43:34.941 --> 00:43:35.700
<v Speaker 4>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1053
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:36.533
<v Speaker 4>is that the meditation aspect of it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's so hard for people to go to get </v>

1054
00:43:40.491 --> 00:43:43.160
<v Speaker 4>out of their own way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but once you do it for awhile,</v>

1055
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:45.260
<v Speaker 4>you realize you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I crave it.</v>

1056
00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.690
<v Speaker 4>I can't go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't go a few days without.</v>

1057
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.390
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I start getting antsy and I go,</v>

1058
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.660
<v Speaker 4>I gotTa Kinda Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1059
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also a very pretentious thing.</v>

1060
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:55.670
<v Speaker 4>Not really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it sounds like it is like,</v>

1061
00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:59.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm better than you do yoga.</v>

1062
00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:00.860
<v Speaker 4>Then I'm going to have hummus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1063
00:44:00.861 --> 00:44:01.490
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1064
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:02.600
<v Speaker 4>I hate this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1065
00:44:02.601 --> 00:44:05.360
<v Speaker 4>you know what the thing was when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>started 10 years ago,</v>

1066
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:09.650
<v Speaker 4>a buddy brought me in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was 98 percent female.</v>

1067
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:14.000
<v Speaker 4>Now I've noticed it's a 50 slash 50.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to go to a different class.</v>

1068
00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:16.083
<v Speaker 4>Reason not to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if there's a guy in front of you </v>

1069
00:44:17.901 --> 00:44:20.350
<v Speaker 4>and as you've both been Dover's of guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>sack,</v>

1070
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:23.740
<v Speaker 4>like that's not what I'm trying to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>is I think that it was for,</v>

1071
00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.790
<v Speaker 4>for a long time it was state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1072
00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:26.893
<v Speaker 4>frowned upon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1073
00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:30.290
<v Speaker 4>For men to go to yoga and I know I even </v>
<v Speaker 4>had those thoughts.</v>

1074
00:44:30.291 --> 00:44:31.124
<v Speaker 4>I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1075
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:31.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yoga,</v>

1076
00:44:31.891 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

1077
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.160
<v Speaker 5>want to go hit the gym and get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1078
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 5>get a pump on Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get checked.</v>

1079
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.120
<v Speaker 5>But now I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1080
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:38.963
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see all the benefits and everything </v>

1081
00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.000
<v Speaker 5>to incorporate that with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1082
00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.830
<v Speaker 5>with the pump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For Jujitsu,</v>

1083
00:44:43.831 --> 00:44:44.664
<v Speaker 5>it's huge because range of motion is one</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the most important things that you </v>

1084
00:44:47.311 --> 00:44:50.070
<v Speaker 5>Jitsu and flexibility,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially when you have a good guard.</v>

1085
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.660
<v Speaker 5>And I got into yoga for the most part </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of Hickson,</v>

1086
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:55.770
<v Speaker 5>Hickson,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gracie.</v>

1087
00:44:56.130 --> 00:45:01.130
<v Speaker 5>And I remember in 1994 I saw a video of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hixon gracie doing yoga.</v>

1088
00:45:01.171 --> 00:45:02.610
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1089
00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:03.653
<v Speaker 5>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody would always say that Hickson </v>

1090
00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:05.664
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was all these great gracie family </v>

1091
00:45:07.501 --> 00:45:08.700
<v Speaker 5>members.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hands was great,</v>

1092
00:45:08.701 --> 00:45:11.160
<v Speaker 5>high end was great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All these guys were great health,</v>

1093
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:14.880
<v Speaker 5>but Hickson was always thought to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>number one and I was like,</v>

1094
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:15.743
<v Speaker 5>well why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why is he so much better than everybody </v>

1095
00:45:16.831 --> 00:45:17.480
<v Speaker 5>else?</v>

1096
00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.810
<v Speaker 5>And then I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1097
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:20.910
<v Speaker 5>he's got like the full package like he </v>
<v Speaker 5>has.</v>

1098
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:21.923
<v Speaker 5>His Dad is Helio Gracie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so his dad was like one of the </v>

1099
00:45:24.151 --> 00:45:27.420
<v Speaker 5>originators of Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he grew up with it.</v>

1100
00:45:27.421 --> 00:45:30.780
<v Speaker 5>It's in his DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He trained his whole life under the best</v>

1101
00:45:30.781 --> 00:45:31.614
<v Speaker 5>teachers in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then yoga in training and exercise </v>

1102
00:45:34.861 --> 00:45:35.694
<v Speaker 5>like Hixon does balance beams,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which stands on a balance beam and does </v>

1103
00:45:38.461 --> 00:45:39.294
<v Speaker 5>a full split.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Standing up holds his foot over his </v>

1104
00:45:41.131 --> 00:45:43.620
<v Speaker 5>head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's fucking freaky to watch.</v>

1105
00:45:43.621 --> 00:45:45.810
<v Speaker 5>He's just got incredible control of his </v>
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>

1106
00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:46.883
<v Speaker 5>So the dexterity and the control of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>body along with the strength and </v>

1107
00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.640
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's what made Hickson who is,</v>

1108
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:55.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it's just,</v>

1109
00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:57.450
<v Speaker 5>it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those things,</v>

1110
00:45:57.451 --> 00:46:00.270
<v Speaker 5>it's not as cool as telling someone you </v>
<v Speaker 5>dead lift 600 pounds,</v>

1111
00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:01.593
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>either what are you doing to deadlift </v>

1112
00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:03.750
<v Speaker 5>and 600,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>

1113
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:04.370
<v Speaker 5>six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>zero,</v>

1114
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:05.203
<v Speaker 5>five three.</v>

1115
00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put chains on it.</v>

1116
00:46:09.391 --> 00:46:12.500
<v Speaker 5>Cause it's not hard enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that kind of stuff is going to,</v>

1117
00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.820
<v Speaker 5>that's going to catch up at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the end of your life,</v>

1118
00:46:14.821 --> 00:46:15.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1119
00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:16.750
<v Speaker 5>that's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1120
00:46:16.751 --> 00:46:18.300
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're not careful,</v>

1121
00:46:18.301 --> 00:46:22.950
<v Speaker 5>you too much of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it's really going to cause a</v>

1122
00:46:22.951 --> 00:46:25.350
<v Speaker 5>lot of pain in your later life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can,</v>

1123
00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.270
<v Speaker 5>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you just do yoga,</v>

1124
00:46:27.271 --> 00:46:29.010
<v Speaker 5>you look like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a month course.</v>

1125
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.800
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to get jacked as well.</v>

1126
00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:34.420
<v Speaker 5>That's a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1127
00:46:34.421 --> 00:46:35.580
<v Speaker 5>I mean depends on what you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

1128
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:38.940
<v Speaker 5>But I agree with you that it does give </v>
<v Speaker 5>you a calming thing.</v>

1129
00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.830
<v Speaker 5>Charms you down or away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:44.670
<v Speaker 5>And I think there's Hixon look at that </v>
<v Speaker 5>picture of him on the beach,</v>

1131
00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.830
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't do that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's unbelievably flexible.</v>

1133
00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:49.920
<v Speaker 5>You've got to get into it.</v>

1134
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.240
<v Speaker 5>You got to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>whole lot of human beings that I can do </v>

1136
00:46:55.171 --> 00:46:56.004

<v Speaker 5>But forget about like world class black </v>

1174
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:15.303
<v Speaker 4>How important is that that you actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>worked your way through it even though </v>

1175
00:48:16.961 --> 00:48:18.120
<v Speaker 4>your Clint Eastwood son?</v>

1176
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.073

1177
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.830
<v Speaker 4>it didn't feel like he helped use and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know,</v>

1178
00:48:23.831 --> 00:48:24.664
<v Speaker 4>maybe he did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

1179
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:25.630
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1180
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:26.381
<v Speaker 4>have you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyone who knows,</v>

1181
00:48:26.381 --> 00:48:28.680
<v Speaker 4>my dad would just laugh at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1182
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:29.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1183
00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:30.400
<v Speaker 4>they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

1184
00:48:30.401 --> 00:48:33.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean my dad is very old school and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1185
00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.870
<v Speaker 4>he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very tough on his sons.</v>

1186
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.760
<v Speaker 4>He has an older brother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1187
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.823
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just doesn't happen like that in our </v>

1188
00:48:39.851 --> 00:48:41.020
<v Speaker 4>family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1189
00:48:41.021 --> 00:48:43.240
<v Speaker 4>there's no handouts and you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

1190
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:44.103
<v Speaker 4>you got to go get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I can't thank him enough for that </v>

1191
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:50.290
<v Speaker 4>because it never gave me any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a backup,</v>

1192
00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:50.550
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1193
00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:51.383
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it didn't,</v>

1194
00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.700
<v Speaker 4>it didn't make me go well and I can just</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of sit around or you know,</v>

1195
00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:58.000
<v Speaker 4>it created drive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>created,</v>

1196
00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:59.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hard work and driving.</v>

1197
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:03.670
<v Speaker 4>Those are all the things that take to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make somebody successful yet like if you</v>

1198
00:49:03.671 --> 00:49:07.150
<v Speaker 4>were 22 and he made you a star of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>big movie,</v>

1199
00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:08.900
<v Speaker 4>that would been something that would've </v>
<v Speaker 4>looked.</v>

1200
00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.660
<v Speaker 4>It would've looked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked really bad on him.</v>

1201
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:12.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so and yeah.</v>

1202
00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean he could do that I guess when in </v>
<v Speaker 4>his movie,</v>

1203
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:17.590
<v Speaker 4>but I think the common thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you had,</v>

1204
00:49:17.591 --> 00:49:19.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had it easy because you know,</v>

1205
00:49:19.241 --> 00:49:20.074
<v Speaker 4>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can't just pick up a phone and call </v>

1206
00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.250
<v Speaker 4>some big director and tell him who he </v>
<v Speaker 4>should cast.</v>

1207
00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:26.120
<v Speaker 4>And if he did it would be a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1208
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean for the director probably tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>

1209
00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:30.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank you clint.</v>

1210
00:49:30.071 --> 00:49:31.140

<v Speaker 4>thing where he had a,</v>

1214
00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:44.770
<v Speaker 4>a s like a seat next to him and talked.</v>

1264
00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.940
<v Speaker 4>that's the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of times you'll never do.</v>

1265
00:51:22.941 --> 00:51:23.331
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because those people that are in those </v>

1277
00:51:44.591 --> 00:51:47.740
<v Speaker 5>sheltered families where he's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not good.</v>

1278
00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:48.753
<v Speaker 5>It's not good for you.</v>

1279
00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:49.683
<v Speaker 4>No it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1280
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:52.570
<v Speaker 4>you don't have the value for a dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The value for hard work,</v>

1281
00:51:52.571 --> 00:51:55.020
<v Speaker 4>you don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything becomes</v>

1282
00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:57.890
<v Speaker 5>blurred.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1283
00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:00.720
<v Speaker 5>I think that's the same way with </v>
<v Speaker 5>inheritance.</v>

1284
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:04.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's very rare that someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>inherits a shitload of money early on in</v>

1285
00:52:04.981 --> 00:52:07.500
<v Speaker 5>life and then winds up having character </v>
<v Speaker 5>and being.</v>

1286
00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:10.650
<v Speaker 5>They say that Donald trump is like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he's a cool guy.</v>

1287
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:13.860
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody I know that's met him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know he gets a lot of weird press,</v>

1288
00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:14.963
<v Speaker 5>but the guys that I know that know him </v>
<v Speaker 5>say he's a really nice guy really down </v>

1289
00:52:18.121 --> 00:52:19.350
<v Speaker 5>to earth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really normal,</v>

1290
00:52:19.351 --> 00:52:22.140
<v Speaker 5>really healthy and I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bought a lot of trump's kids,</v>

1291
00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:25.080
<v Speaker 5>which is really strange because he like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's this crazy,</v>

1292
00:52:25.081 --> 00:52:25.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm the best.</v>

1293
00:52:25.981 --> 00:52:27.990
<v Speaker 5>I do the best things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my ratings of the best.</v>

1294
00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:31.710
<v Speaker 5>But you would think that he would be </v>
<v Speaker 5>like this Dickie Dad,</v>

1295
00:52:31.711 --> 00:52:33.990
<v Speaker 5>but apparently he's done a great job as </v>
<v Speaker 5>a dad,</v>

1296
00:52:33.991 --> 00:52:34.824
<v Speaker 5>which is very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's what I hear about Donald </v>

1297
00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:39.000
<v Speaker 5>Trump Jr.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1298
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:39.930
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard that too.</v>

1299
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.990
<v Speaker 5>And he so he does got to be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's got that goal.</v>

1300
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.570
<v Speaker 5>MaYbe that's why he's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean maybe that's probably it.</v>

1301
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:47.730
<v Speaker 5>I mean it might have something to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>with it for real.</v>

1302
00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:49.550
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all those experiences in the wild.</v>

1303
00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.271
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1304
00:52:50.271 --> 00:52:53.280
<v Speaker 5>and we just today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we've shot a lot of.</v>

1305
00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.680
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've been doing this for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

1306
00:52:55.681 --> 00:52:59.460
<v Speaker 5>You've been doing this for years now and</v>
<v Speaker 5>still it's so humbling.</v>

1307
00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:00.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1308
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not easy making a good shot.</v>

1309
00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.373
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every now and then one goes right into </v>

1310
00:53:05.221 --> 00:53:07.200
<v Speaker 5>the neck of the target and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

1311
00:53:07.201 --> 00:53:11.490
<v Speaker 5>I've been doing this all day one just </v>
<v Speaker 5>goes wrong.</v>

1312
00:53:11.491 --> 00:53:12.324
<v Speaker 5>You talk about ego checks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I meAn anytime you think you're good at </v>

1313
00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:16.450
<v Speaker 5>archery for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>

1314
00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:17.890
<v Speaker 5>there's a wake up call.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1315
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:21.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean it is not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not an easy thing to do.</v>

1316
00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:24.540
<v Speaker 5>And then also it's like waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>waiting,</v>

1317
00:53:24.541 --> 00:53:25.710
<v Speaker 5>waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>waiting,</v>

1318
00:53:25.711 --> 00:53:26.461
<v Speaker 5>waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stocking,</v>

1319
00:53:26.461 --> 00:53:27.330
<v Speaker 5>stocking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stocking.</v>

1320
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.880
<v Speaker 5>And then all of a sudden here comes a </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1321
00:53:29.881 --> 00:53:30.690
<v Speaker 5>Ready,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get ready,</v>

1322
00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:32.550

<v Speaker 5>Now is it really happening?</v>

1323
00:53:32.551 --> 00:53:33.384
<v Speaker 5>Is it really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you have to execute a great </v>

1324
00:53:35.101 --> 00:53:35.934
<v Speaker 5>shot under this insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The adrenaline is pumping and you have </v>

1325
00:53:38.071 --> 00:53:41.040
<v Speaker 5>you done bowhunting yet yet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What have you bow hunted deer.</v>

<v Speaker 5>California.</v>

1330

<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1331
00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:51.180
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it'S,</v>

1332
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:53.400
<v Speaker 5>it is like very.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very,</v>

1333
00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:54.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you said,</v>

1334
00:53:54.751 --> 00:53:55.584
<v Speaker 5>it's totally in the pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of a sudden it's now an adrenaline </v>

1335
00:53:59.191 --> 00:54:01.770
<v Speaker 5>adrenaline and then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1336
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.610
<v Speaker 5>it's over because either missed the shot</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you,</v>

1337
00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:04.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1338
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:06.150
<v Speaker 5>you didn't take it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

1339
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.650
<v Speaker 5>you know what they say cam,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's a direct corelation between</v>

1340
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:15.450
<v Speaker 5>lower heart rate and good archery that </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's actually been studies done,</v>

1341
00:54:15.451 --> 00:54:16.110
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like in,</v>

1342
00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:18.750
<v Speaker 5>in these european circles where their </v>
<v Speaker 5>target archers.</v>

1343
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:21.210
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things that they've found</v>
<v Speaker 5>to improve.</v>

1344
00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:23.370
<v Speaker 5>Dudley was talking about this on his </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast,</v>

1345
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.140
<v Speaker 5>knock on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on his podcast.</v>

1346
00:54:25.141 --> 00:54:25.974
<v Speaker 5>He was talking about that running in </v>
<v Speaker 5>particular is really good at lowering </v>

1347
00:54:31.771 --> 00:54:35.760
<v Speaker 5>your heart rate obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then also the side effect of that is</v>

1348
00:54:35.761 --> 00:54:36.594
<v Speaker 5>it iMproves archery and improves your </v>
<v Speaker 5>ability under pressure to keep your </v>

1349
00:54:40.051 --> 00:54:42.270
<v Speaker 5>heart rate down because your heart ways </v>
<v Speaker 5>naturally lower.</v>

1350
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:43.051
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1351
00:54:43.051 --> 00:54:43.884
<v Speaker 5>like your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your resting heart rate's got to be </v>

1352
00:54:44.611 --> 00:54:45.750
<v Speaker 5>stupid law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what is it?</v>

1353
00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:46.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forties,</v>

1354
00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:48.323
<v Speaker 5>forties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1355
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.313
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I thought mine was good in the 55 or </v>

1356
00:54:51.331 --> 00:54:52.230
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

1357
00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:54.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what michael bisping's is 34.</v>

1358
00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:55.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she Is.</v>

1359
00:54:55.951 --> 00:54:56.784
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nor most good marathon runners or low </v>

1360
00:55:00.421 --> 00:55:01.750
<v Speaker 5>forties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1361
00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.330
<v Speaker 5>upper thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1362
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:04.313
<v Speaker 5>So when you have that going for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like say if your heart rate gets jacked </v>

1363
00:55:07.951 --> 00:55:08.784
<v Speaker 5>up and you calm it down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're probably still going to be like </v>

1364
00:55:11.071 --> 00:55:12.570
<v Speaker 5>within the sixties or seventies.</v>

1365
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:13.703
<v Speaker 5>Whereas a guy who's like some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>baba with some big sloppy gut and you </v>

1366
00:55:17.701 --> 00:55:18.534
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's taken rip fuel just so he can </v>

1367
00:55:20.431 --> 00:55:21.264
<v Speaker 5>get up to the top of the mountain when </v>
<v Speaker 5>he gets up there and see some of these </v>

1368
00:55:23.341 --> 00:55:25.770
<v Speaker 5>book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's tired,</v>

1369
00:55:25.771 --> 00:55:26.604
<v Speaker 5>he's winded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His heart rates already jacked and it's </v>

1370
00:55:28.831 --> 00:55:31.560
<v Speaker 5>harder to execute a good shot and under </v>
<v Speaker 5>those conditions.</v>

1371
00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:32.473
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I mean just like with running and </v>

1372
00:55:33.661 --> 00:55:34.494
<v Speaker 5>exercising,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you recover faster the better shape </v>

1373
00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:36.640
<v Speaker 5>you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

1374
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.730
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it can go,</v>

1375
00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:41.370
<v Speaker 5>it can peak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then it's back low,</v>

1376
00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:42.204
<v Speaker 5>normal and then you're more composed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I mean it takes a while for those </v>

1377
00:55:45.091 --> 00:55:45.924
<v Speaker 5>guys to recover if they're not in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>After all my years of exercIsing have </v>

1378
00:55:50.641 --> 00:55:53.040
<v Speaker 5>just started running,</v>
<v Speaker 5>running.</v>

1379
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:55.110
<v Speaker 5>We're running today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're running the trails today.</v>

1380
00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:58.140
<v Speaker 5>After this I'm going to keep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to keep up with him.</v>

1381
00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:01.710
<v Speaker 5>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy for me buddy.</v>

1382
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:04.110
<v Speaker 5>Doing jujitsu with hixon.</v>

1383
00:56:04.111 --> 00:56:06.140
<v Speaker 5>Just go out there and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't be a pussy.</v>

<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1386
00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:12.650
<v Speaker 5>Just kidding.</v>

00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:19.720
<v Speaker 5>how many do you do a day?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1391
00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:21.210
<v Speaker 5>you can do a marathon everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1392
00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:23.000
<v Speaker 5>You'd kill yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was doing a half marathon every day.</v>

1393
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.213
<v Speaker 5>At least</v>

1394
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.200
<v Speaker 2>you know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's days or.</v>

1395
00:56:26.201 --> 00:56:27.034
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's weeks getting ready for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the big foot that I had ran 130 140 </v>

1396
00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:31.474
<v Speaker 2>miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's almost 20 miles a day in the </v>

1397
00:56:33.341 --> 00:56:36.250
<v Speaker 2>big foot is 200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>five miles over.</v>

1398
00:56:36.251 --> 00:56:37.061
<v Speaker 2>Said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you do?</v>

1399
00:56:37.061 --> 00:56:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Seventy eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventy eight.</v>

1400
00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:40.480
<v Speaker 2>Fifty six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that?</v>

1401
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:44.590
<v Speaker 2>A ultra marathon guy who finished six </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds passed the deadline.</v>

1402
00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barcelona at the barkley marathon.</v>

1403
00:56:47.561 --> 00:56:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fucked up.</v>

1404
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:52.300
<v Speaker 2>I took a detour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I know that that race,</v>

1405
00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.870
<v Speaker 2>they've been sending me messages and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they tagged.</v>

1406
00:56:56.170 --> 00:57:00.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was both of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the other day on or did a tweet.</v>

1407
00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:01.713
<v Speaker 2>Somebody mentioned my name for it and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>the race actually tweeted and said that </v>

1408
00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:07.240
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be able to finish because I'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

1409
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:08.583
<v Speaker 2>I'd want to get up in a tree stand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill some of the wild pigs running </v>

1410
00:57:10.931 --> 00:57:11.950
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it'd be.</v>

1411
00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I apparently I didn't know this,</v>

1412
00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:14.853
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that barkley marathon itself tweeted </v>

1413
00:57:16.961 --> 00:57:18.910
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it Tennessee?</v>

1414
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:22.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the place is infested apparently.</v>

1415
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:23.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tennessee.</v>

1416
00:57:23.381 --> 00:57:25.060
<v Speaker 2>So it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got.</v>

1417
00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:25.953
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole story behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I knew it because I'm going to </v>

1418
00:57:27.701 --> 00:57:28.534
<v Speaker 2>sound stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a prison there and I can't </v>

1419
00:57:30.761 --> 00:57:31.594
<v Speaker 2>remember who was in the prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some famous criminal killed somebody or </v>

1420
00:57:35.951 --> 00:57:37.300
<v Speaker 2>tried to kill somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1421
00:57:37.301 --> 00:57:41.870
<v Speaker 2>escaped and he made it a was out for 55 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>

1422
00:57:41.871 --> 00:57:45.070
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Made it just eight miles in and they got</v>

1423
00:57:45.071 --> 00:57:45.904
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of how the race </v>

1424
00:57:46.841 --> 00:57:49.090
<v Speaker 2>originated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a story behind it.</v>

1425
00:57:49.091 --> 00:57:51.070
<v Speaker 2>So the race is there around that prison </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>

1426
00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:51.983
<v Speaker 2>in that same country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the goal of the time limit is </v>

1427
00:57:55.631 --> 00:58:00.550
<v Speaker 2>something around that 55 hours and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have five loops.</v>

1428
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:03.130
<v Speaker 2>You go one one way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a first loop,</v>

1429
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:04.540
<v Speaker 2>opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite,</v>

1430
00:58:04.541 --> 00:58:05.860
<v Speaker 2>opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have.</v>

1431
00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:09.580
<v Speaker 2>And the course isn't marked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're navigating with a map that you</v>

1432
00:58:09.581 --> 00:58:13.460
<v Speaker 2>have to create yourself and to get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>checkpoints.</v>

1433
00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:14.403
<v Speaker 2>There's books there at every checkpoint </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have a certain number of the </v>

1434
00:58:17.531 --> 00:58:22.090
<v Speaker 2>page and they say you go and pull out </v>
<v Speaker 2>page 12 of every book,</v>

1435
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:23.013
<v Speaker 2>this is how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you bring it back to make sure </v>

1436
00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:27.220
<v Speaker 2>they check you when you get the lap </v>
<v Speaker 2>completed inside.</v>

1437
00:58:27.221 --> 00:58:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1438
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:28.743
<v Speaker 2>he hit every checkpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's all the pages of those books and </v>

1439
00:58:31.031 --> 00:58:34.930
<v Speaker 2>then you do another lap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what if you run with some douche bag</v>

1440
00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:36.130
<v Speaker 2>who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1441
00:58:36.131 --> 00:58:39.250
<v Speaker 2>page three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pulling his page to page seven.</v>

1442
00:58:39.251 --> 00:58:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Could suck my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1443
00:58:41.070 --> 00:58:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Started pulling people's pages out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1444
00:58:43.361 --> 00:58:44.194
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1445
00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:45.183
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's honor in if somebody's working </v>

1446
00:58:47.741 --> 00:58:49.690
<v Speaker 2>that hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually don't have to worry.</v>

1447
00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.320
<v Speaker 2>They respect other people working at </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart,</v>

1448
00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:52.120
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1449
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:54.430
<v Speaker 2>It's just kind of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1450
00:58:54.431 --> 00:58:56.140
<v Speaker 2>the honor system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had the culture of it.</v>

1451
00:58:56.141 --> 00:58:56.974
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean I wouldn't worry about </v>

1452
00:58:58.241 --> 00:59:00.280
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it sounds like a brutal race.</v>

1453
00:59:00.281 --> 00:59:01.114
<v Speaker 2>I think only me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be up to 15 people now have </v>

1454
00:59:05.021 --> 00:59:08.890
<v Speaker 2>completed it in 25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1455
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:12.280
<v Speaker 2>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this guy missed it by six seconds.</v>

1456
00:59:12.281 --> 00:59:13.114
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ because he fucked up and </v>

1457
00:59:14.921 --> 00:59:17.110
<v Speaker 2>made a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an error in his past.</v>

1458
00:59:17.111 --> 00:59:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Something happened and I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1459
00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:21.040
<v Speaker 2>I didn't read the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

1460
00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:24.560
<v Speaker 2>So you have to do it inside a 60 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what he doesn't like that?</v>

1461
00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was like 60 hours in six seconds</v>

1462
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:29.120
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says he,</v>

1463
00:59:29.121 --> 00:59:30.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was going around the race,</v>

1464
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:31.483
<v Speaker 2>you've found that you came to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>staircase and there's no staircases in </v>

1465
00:59:33.531 --> 00:59:35.930
<v Speaker 2>the marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So kneW doing fucked up then.</v>

1466
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a super sleep deprived.</v>

1467
00:59:38.631 --> 00:59:39.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he made a wrong turn.</v>

1468
00:59:39.850 --> 00:59:41.690
<v Speaker 2>You're two miles from the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

1469
00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1470
00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:45.650
<v Speaker 2>And there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no course.</v>

1471
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.500
<v Speaker 2>So you just run into the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1472
00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the map up there,</v>

1473
00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:53.054
<v Speaker 2>the topo map up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you create your own map off of that </v>

1474
00:59:56.271 --> 00:59:58.820
<v Speaker 2>map and you can't use a map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't use a phone,</v>

1475
00:59:58.821 --> 00:59:59.654
<v Speaker 2>you can't use a gps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's navigating is part of the </v>

1476
01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:04.820
<v Speaker 2>same when you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do it.</v>

1478
01:00:09.701 --> 01:00:10.534
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole process in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to sit and like a letter and a </v>

1479
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:15.583
<v Speaker 2>dollar 47,</v>

1480
01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:18.614
<v Speaker 2>director and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they select who they want in there and </v>

1481
01:00:20.571 --> 01:00:22.610
<v Speaker 2>then you have to bring a license plate </v>
<v Speaker 2>from your house,</v>

1482
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:27.670
<v Speaker 2>from your home state and like a shirt to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy and then you're in.</v>

1488
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:39.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to be a specific training.</v>

<v Speaker 2>cool because that race is so special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's so special as far as her passion </v>

1508

<v Speaker 2>people to really test themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was on your podcast?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure people will find it.</v>

1516
01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:46.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1517
01:01:46.671 --> 01:01:48.830
<v Speaker 2>it was good though because she's super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super cool.</v>

1518
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:52.460
<v Speaker 2>And so she's putting on this new one in </v>
<v Speaker 2>moab and it's,</v>

1519
01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:54.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>further than any other race.</v>

1520
01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:57.860
<v Speaker 2>And so I want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there it is.</v>

1523
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:03.980

1526
01:02:07.581 --> 01:02:08.414
<v Speaker 2>Five pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd feel like thirtY four miles is </v>

1527
01:02:10.611 --> 01:02:14.030
<v Speaker 2>a little too far just to round down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird number.</v>

1528
01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean let's do the.</v>

1529
01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:20.370
<v Speaker 2>How about the moab 50?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's closer.</v>

1530
01:02:20.371 --> 01:02:22.350
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to run on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that better.</v>

1531
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:23.223
<v Speaker 2>Sounds better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the 234 point three and p if you </v>

1532
01:02:26.401 --> 01:02:29.310
<v Speaker 2>run 234 miles an extra 16 probably just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1533
01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:31.590
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm already dead.</v>

1534
01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:35.570
<v Speaker 2>It's a long way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was looking at that country.</v>

1535
01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.530

<v Speaker 2>You'll be fairly cool.</v>

1539
01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Now you were saying that when you do one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these things,</v>

1540
01:02:46.771 --> 01:02:51.600
<v Speaker 2>you don't sleep like you slept maybe an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour a couple of times.</v>

1541
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how,</v>

1542
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:58.320
<v Speaker 2>you know if you want to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the guy who won richard total beast.</v>

1543
01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm always asking how long because my </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal was to win,</v>

1544
01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:02.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1545
01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.590
<v Speaker 2>I didn't achieve my goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My goal was to.</v>

1546
01:03:04.591 --> 01:03:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to get the fastest ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I came up short on that.</v>

1547
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.470
<v Speaker 2>but what place did you place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I finished eighth.</v>

1548
01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was winning through 62 miles I </v>

1549
01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:16.950
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And richard passed me.</v>

1550
01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:18.143
<v Speaker 2>fuck richard.</v>

1551
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:21.700
<v Speaker 2>He's a star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1552
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.830
<v Speaker 2>I was asking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1553
01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:25.110
<v Speaker 2>how long had he been sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1554
01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:27.570
<v Speaker 2>at these checkpoints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said 15 minutes.</v>

1555
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:28.463
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1556
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:29.813
<v Speaker 2>So I have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I decided I wasn't going to sleep </v>

1557
01:03:32.311 --> 01:03:34.980
<v Speaker 2>until I got 100 miles down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to get at least halfway done.</v>

1558
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:39.510
<v Speaker 2>So it got to 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slept for about an hour and got up.</v>

1559
01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.890
<v Speaker 2>And then I ended up sleeping for three </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours total over the 78 hours.</v>

1560
01:03:43.891 --> 01:03:46.340
<v Speaker 2>So you sleep about an hour a day if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to.</v>

1561
01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:47.183
<v Speaker 2>If your hope is to compete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to win or to a place highlight like I </v>

1562
01:03:51.031 --> 01:03:53.130
<v Speaker 2>wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't sleep.</v>

1563
01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:54.780
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any interest in doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1564
01:03:54.781 --> 01:03:55.540
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1569

1631
01:06:34.631 --> 01:06:35.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got a lot down there.</v>

1632
01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:38.210
<v Speaker 4>So have you hunted there too?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1633
01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:41.740
<v Speaker 4>we never get a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you hunted in south here?</v>

1634
01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:46.370
<v Speaker 4>Mostly in the southern California area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1635
01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:50.460
<v Speaker 4>when you were hunting we still hunting </v>
<v Speaker 4>spot and stalk like,</v>

1636
01:06:50.461 --> 01:06:51.294
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>

1637
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.233
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just stand and just knowing the areas </v>

1638
01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:55.331
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a,</v>

1639
01:06:55.331 --> 01:06:56.164
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a friend who knew the areas and walking </v>

1640
01:06:58.090 --> 01:06:58.923
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a flushing them out and you were doing </v>

1641
01:07:01.691 --> 01:07:02.524
<v Speaker 4>it with that rostow by laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that he's just a little bit </v>

1642
01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:11.220
<v Speaker 4>self conscious about the roth man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That thing.</v>

1643
01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:14.440
<v Speaker 4>That thing was a good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey it killed a deer apparently.</v>

1644
01:07:14.441 --> 01:07:16.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So well now that you have a hoyt though.</v>

1645
01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that things like the most balance.</v>

1646
01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:22.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean you feel immediately there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's new ones are so good.</v>

1647
01:07:22.481 --> 01:07:23.314
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy because the first one cam </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever got me was only four years ago and </v>

1648
01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:28.240
<v Speaker 4>you think like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1649
01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:29.283
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty recent but it was awesome </v>

1650
01:07:31.271 --> 01:07:31.840
<v Speaker 4>at the time.</v>

1651
01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:32.673
<v Speaker 4>But if you had to go back to it today </v>
<v Speaker 4>and be like oh this piece of shit like </v>

1652
01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:37.060
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not really.</v>

1653
01:07:37.061 --> 01:07:37.894
<v Speaker 4>But both technology just keeps </v>
<v Speaker 4>increasing every year they get a little </v>

1654
01:07:41.321 --> 01:07:42.310
<v Speaker 4>better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit better.</v>

1655
01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.280
<v Speaker 4>Little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1656
01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.410
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you might not know.</v>

1657
01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I always say it's like,</v>

1658
01:07:46.751 --> 01:07:48.100
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1659
01:07:48.101 --> 01:07:49.990
<v Speaker 4>I try not to be the guy who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1660
01:07:49.991 --> 01:07:50.824
<v Speaker 4>this is the best thing I've ever shot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's slightly better and as we know </v>

1661
01:07:54.581 --> 01:07:58.240
<v Speaker 4>and hunting that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's a fine line between success</v>

1662
01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:00.310
<v Speaker 4>and failure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's slightly better.</v>

1663
01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:02.440
<v Speaker 4>Might be the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1664
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:06.910
<v Speaker 4>a lot more an amateur and comparison and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to beat him.</v>

1665
01:08:06.970 --> 01:08:08.050
<v Speaker 4>I did it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot him.</v>

1666
01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.700
<v Speaker 4>He did yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He made a couple of times.</v>

1667
01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:13.990
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're taking the liberty to </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember.</v>

1668
01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:15.383
<v Speaker 4>Remember a.</v>

1669
01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:19.633
<v Speaker 2>That is the beautiful thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>archery is that there really is no </v>

1670
01:08:21.501 --> 01:08:23.040
<v Speaker 2>perfection in archery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1671
01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:24.043
<v Speaker 2>you can get a perfect shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to be perfect every time you shoot </v>

1672
01:08:26.991 --> 01:08:31.520
<v Speaker 2>is never been done really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say by the end of the day we were</v>

1673
01:08:31.521 --> 01:08:33.980
<v Speaker 2>out there in the parking lot of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>riverside archery.</v>

1674
01:08:33.981 --> 01:08:38.981
<v Speaker 2>We had 46 yard shot and scott was laying</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in their nice tight group.</v>

1675
01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:41.043
<v Speaker 2>We were shooting three arrows at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean so and that's just in a day with </v>

1676
01:08:44.601 --> 01:08:47.060
<v Speaker 2>that new blow that yet did.</v>

1677
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:51.750
<v Speaker 5>Kim and I were talking about this today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if people knew how good it feels to like</v>

1678
01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:54.650
<v Speaker 5>steady yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anchor,</v>

1679
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:57.650
<v Speaker 5>like look to that peep site,</v>
<v Speaker 5>breathe,</v>

1680
01:08:57.651 --> 01:09:00.380
<v Speaker 5>release that arrow and watch it or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

1681
01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the best feeling.</v>

1682
01:09:03.071 --> 01:09:04.150
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>

1683
01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:05.133
<v Speaker 2>Well we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we filmed today and so I took a shot is </v>

1684
01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.353
<v Speaker 2>61 yards at that with my big old heavy </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrow and I shot and I was like run up </v>

1685
01:09:12.431 --> 01:09:13.264
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the binoculars and I look and it was </v>

1686
01:09:14.561 --> 01:09:16.110
<v Speaker 2>a perfect shot and I was like so </v>
<v Speaker 2>excited.</v>

1687
01:09:16.111 --> 01:09:16.944
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time I ever shot a bow and </v>

1688
01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:20.410
<v Speaker 2>that was not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just how fun it is.</v>

1689
01:09:20.411 --> 01:09:24.310
<v Speaker 2>This is how excited I still get and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just in people.</v>

1690
01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I told joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1691
01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:28.540
<v Speaker 2>if people knew this or I mean they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to watch this and go,</v>

1692
01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:31.150
<v Speaker 2>I want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That looks awesome.</v>

1693
01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:33.490
<v Speaker 2>If you're after 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting this excited.</v>

1694
01:09:33.491 --> 01:09:34.324
<v Speaker 2>It's just up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about this today and I </v>

1695
01:09:36.401 --> 01:09:37.840
<v Speaker 2>want to bring this up and I think</v>

1696
01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.013
<v Speaker 5>hoyt should do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The big entry barrier in in learning </v>

1697
01:09:43.311 --> 01:09:47.930
<v Speaker 5>archery is having someone teach you and </v>
<v Speaker 5>like going somewhere and not knowing how</v>

1698
01:09:47.931 --> 01:09:50.570
<v Speaker 5>to get started.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like once you get started and you say,</v>

1699
01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.910
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a 28 inch straw.</v>

1700
01:09:52.911 --> 01:09:56.690
<v Speaker 5>Oh I like a 450 green arrow and you know</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the stuff that you need.</v>

1701
01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:59.450
<v Speaker 5>Then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it becomes easier to sort of do,</v>

1702
01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.570
<v Speaker 5>but the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so daunting and confusing.</v>

1703
01:10:02.571 --> 01:10:05.120
<v Speaker 5>The learning curve so long they should </v>
<v Speaker 5>have,</v>

1704
01:10:05.121 --> 01:10:10.040
<v Speaker 5>like hoyt should have a white academy or</v>
<v Speaker 5>a place you can go where you could buy a</v>

1705
01:10:10.041 --> 01:10:11.990
<v Speaker 5>bow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They size you,</v>

1706
01:10:11.991 --> 01:10:12.824
<v Speaker 5>they fill you up to the correct draw </v>
<v Speaker 5>length and then you sign up for a class </v>

1707
01:10:16.311 --> 01:10:18.330
<v Speaker 5>and there's a teacher and they show you </v>
<v Speaker 5>how to do it.</v>

1708
01:10:18.331 --> 01:10:20.800
<v Speaker 5>If there was something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas like you know,</v>

1709
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:23.740
<v Speaker 5>you can go take karate somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could take jujitsu somewhere,</v>

1710
01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:26.480
<v Speaker 5>go try to take archery somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's not a lot of places.</v>

1711
01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:27.920
<v Speaker 5>And if they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1712
01:10:27.921 --> 01:10:30.500
<v Speaker 5>like the first place that I went to his.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh fucking sketchy.</v>

1713
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:31.703
<v Speaker 5>No they weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't really know my draw length </v>

1714
01:10:34.111 --> 01:10:34.960
<v Speaker 5>is too long.</v>

1715
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:37.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a good pro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shops are hard to find.</v>

1716
01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.620
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky with the bell rock back home.</v>

1717
01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wayne does that.</v>

1718
01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.070
<v Speaker 2>Wayne takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes the,</v>

1719
01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:44.913
<v Speaker 2>teaches them right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He coaches them and it seemed like </v>

1720
01:10:47.131 --> 01:10:50.850
<v Speaker 2>riverside archery was that chris?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There Is a nice guy.</v>

1721
01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:53.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And totally knows archery to so.</v>

1722
01:10:53.970 --> 01:10:58.680
<v Speaker 2>But those might be a unique examples </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a lot of pro shops.</v>

1723
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:59.783
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy who works with under armour is </v>

1724
01:11:01.741 --> 01:11:04.250
<v Speaker 2>telling me about his pro shot back home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1725
01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.900
<v Speaker 2>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're almost making fun of him.</v>

1726
01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:08.370
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his actually not him,</v>

1727
01:11:08.371 --> 01:11:11.760
<v Speaker 2>but his cousin was in there trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get set up with a bow and it's just like</v>

1728
01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:14.970
<v Speaker 2>we made fun of him because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1729
01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't know.</v>

1752
01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:16.240
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't even feel it slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1753
01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:18.180
<v Speaker 2>It would be like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I told them about the.</v>

1754
01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:20.490
<v Speaker 2>We put up this bear quip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1755
01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:21.443
<v Speaker 2>before we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think before we realized the victim </v>

1756
01:12:23.941 --> 01:12:28.941
<v Speaker 2>that will come out of of bear hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but joe retweeted the video of this bear</v>

1757
01:12:29.341 --> 01:12:30.174
<v Speaker 2>stood up and it was grabbing this beaver</v>
<v Speaker 2>up there and I shot it and we had a </v>

1758
01:12:33.451 --> 01:12:37.710
<v Speaker 2>gopro on the backside of it and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrow went through the bear,</v>

1759
01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:38.573
<v Speaker 2>came out the back side and it was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like didn't even slow down now and just </v>

1760
01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:45.360
<v Speaker 2>kind of all this stuff kind of came out </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the arrow just like,</v>

1761
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:46.223
<v Speaker 2>what was the sound?</v>

1762
01:12:48.930 --> 01:12:53.190
<v Speaker 2>That's the sound that arrow made through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the glass through the bear's body.</v>

1763
01:12:53.191 --> 01:12:55.890
<v Speaker 2>And then the bear went on a full sprInt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1764
01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:56.893
<v Speaker 2>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like almost right where you guys work </v>

1765
01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:01.430
<v Speaker 2>slightly off to your right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when,</v>

1766
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:03.480
<v Speaker 2>if you've never seen a bear sprint </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

1767
01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:06.090
<v Speaker 2>like when you see them lumber around you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1768
01:13:06.091 --> 01:13:08.200
<v Speaker 2>oh well I kind of get an idea without </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

1769
01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.130
<v Speaker 2>do bull shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1770
01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:13.050
<v Speaker 2>that thing is like usain bolt when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>threw an arrow through it.</v>

1771
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that.</v>

1772
01:13:14.011 --> 01:13:14.844
<v Speaker 2>So that was a 400 pound bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could imagine what brian was </v>

1773
01:13:18.241 --> 01:13:19.110
<v Speaker 2>asking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is he,</v>

1774
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:22.080
<v Speaker 2>160 pounds?</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's about 110.</v>

1775
01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.001
<v Speaker 2>Maybe one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1776
01:13:24.001 --> 01:13:25.230
<v Speaker 2>six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere around there.</v>

1777
01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:26.820
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told her,</v>

1778
01:13:26.821 --> 01:13:27.301
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1779
01:13:27.301 --> 01:13:30.750
<v Speaker 2>these bows wouldn't even slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't even know what I mean.</v>

1780
01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:31.673
<v Speaker 2>you would be too late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would go through you and then you'd </v>

1781
01:13:33.181 --> 01:13:33.600
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1782
01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:34.261
<v Speaker 2>Just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1783
01:13:34.261 --> 01:13:35.530
<v Speaker 2>why am I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I missed that skateboard through the </v>

1788
01:13:45.601 --> 01:13:46.560
<v Speaker 2>clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There you got some rotten zombie head </v>

1791
01:13:50.131 --> 01:13:51.910
<v Speaker 2>and the arrows are just sticking in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

1792
01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:53.250
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking of near death experience,</v>

1793
01:13:53.251 --> 01:13:54.084
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to ask you this because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to podcasts a lot and I talk </v>

1794
01:13:56.420 --> 01:14:01.420
<v Speaker 2>about dmt and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the stuff you see when you know,</v>

1795
01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:04.920
<v Speaker 2>like it produces in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you producing in your body,</v>

1796
01:14:04.921 --> 01:14:09.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the chemical that you released?</v>

1797
01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Like when you die or when you have like </v>
<v Speaker 2>near death experience?</v>

1798
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:14.050
<v Speaker 5>They believe so here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the,</v>

1799
01:14:14.051 --> 01:14:14.884
<v Speaker 5>here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't know for sure until really </v>

1800
01:14:17.171 --> 01:14:18.470
<v Speaker 5>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was easy.</v>

1801
01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:21.250
<v Speaker 5>It was even produced by the pineal </v>
<v Speaker 5>gland.</v>

1802
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:22.143
<v Speaker 5>Now that they know there's a guy named </v>
<v Speaker 5>is produced by a guy named rick </v>

1803
01:14:25.751 --> 01:14:26.584
<v Speaker 5>strassman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dr rick strassman out of the university </v>

1804
01:14:28.241 --> 01:14:29.074
<v Speaker 5>of New Mexico and he put a put together </v>
<v Speaker 5>these clinical trials that were the </v>

1805
01:14:33.011 --> 01:14:33.844
<v Speaker 5>first ever fda approved clinical trials </v>
<v Speaker 5>on a psychedelic drug first ever on dmt </v>

1806
01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:39.243
<v Speaker 5>and they were done in New Mexico and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>did them and he wrote a book about it </v>

1807
01:14:42.731 --> 01:14:43.564
<v Speaker 5>called dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the spirit molecule and one of the </v>

1808
01:14:45.161 --> 01:14:45.994
<v Speaker 5>things that he found.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a great book and one of the things </v>

1809
01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:48.274
<v Speaker 5>you found really fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I read the book before I ever did </v>

1810
01:14:49.781 --> 01:14:50.614
<v Speaker 5>dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing that he found really </v>

1811
01:14:51.761 --> 01:14:55.000
<v Speaker 5>fascinating was that these people had </v>
<v Speaker 5>used uniform experiences.</v>

1812
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.193
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't like one person saw this thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then another person had a totally </v>

1813
01:14:59.411 --> 01:14:59.890
<v Speaker 5>different trip.</v>

1814
01:14:59.890 --> 01:15:00.723
<v Speaker 5>Now they all had like fairly uniform </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences and here's the other thing </v>

1815
01:15:03.941 --> 01:15:04.774
<v Speaker 5>that's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their experiences in manY ways mirror </v>

1816
01:15:07.991 --> 01:15:08.824
<v Speaker 5>the experiences of people that have been</v>
<v Speaker 5>abducted by aliens and people that have </v>

1817
01:15:13.511 --> 01:15:14.344
<v Speaker 5>near death experiences and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>connection they think is that the brain </v>

1818
01:15:17.141 --> 01:15:20.950
<v Speaker 5>produces this chemical called </v>
<v Speaker 5>dimethyltryptamine and we know that it's</v>

1819
01:15:20.951 --> 01:15:21.784
<v Speaker 5>produced by the liver and we know that </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's produced by the lungs and then in </v>

1820
01:15:24.371 --> 01:15:25.204
<v Speaker 5>eastern mysticism it was always thought </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the pineal gland was the seed of </v>

1821
01:15:28.871 --> 01:15:30.240
<v Speaker 5>the soul.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That It was the.</v>

1822
01:15:30.241 --> 01:15:31.750
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the third eye.</v>

1823
01:15:31.751 --> 01:15:35.440
<v Speaker 5>Then in literally in reptiles as it as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>retina and cornea.</v>

1824
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:36.663
<v Speaker 5>It actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like literally an eyeball in the </v>

1825
01:15:38.141 --> 01:15:38.974
<v Speaker 5>center of your head and in the vatican </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a gigantic sculpture of a pine </v>

1826
01:15:44.591 --> 01:15:45.424
<v Speaker 5>cone in the vatican and that pine cone </v>
<v Speaker 5>is supposed to represent the pineal </v>

1827
01:15:49.571 --> 01:15:52.780
<v Speaker 5>gland so you can get a photo of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>gigantic pine cone.</v>

1828
01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:53.913
<v Speaker 5>And I was actually in the vatican last </v>
<v Speaker 5>summer and I had a conversation with a </v>

1829
01:15:56.501 --> 01:15:57.334
<v Speaker 5>guide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have this really cool guy who was a </v>

1830
01:15:58.061 --> 01:16:01.890
<v Speaker 5>professor who was explaining to us all </v>
<v Speaker 5>the different stuff that you know,</v>

1831
01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:02.733
<v Speaker 5>it's all the different symbolisms and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what they mean and they've eastern </v>

1832
01:16:07.361 --> 01:16:11.500
<v Speaker 5>mysticism and a lot of ancient religions</v>
<v Speaker 5>have always been focused,</v>

1833
01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:12.453
<v Speaker 5>heavily focused on the pine cone and </v>
<v Speaker 5>pineal gland and that is what that's </v>

1834
01:16:16.151 --> 01:16:21.151
<v Speaker 5>supposed to represent that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that gigantic pine cone in the middle of</v>

1835
01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:25.120
<v Speaker 5>like people smoke pine cone or there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>some people.</v>

1836
01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:26.013
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some people smoke socks If you </v>

1837
01:16:26.891 --> 01:16:31.891
<v Speaker 5>give them to them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what I heard,</v>

1838
01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:34.203
<v Speaker 5>I heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean over that now that there's some </v>

1839
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:38.410
<v Speaker 5>sort of dmt is like plant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's plant based.</v>

1840
01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:39.513
<v Speaker 5>That is the thing is that the dmt </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't just exist in one plant exists </v>

1841
01:16:43.991 --> 01:16:44.824
<v Speaker 5>in thousands of different plants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they have iowasca when </v>

1842
01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:52.240
<v Speaker 5>iowasca is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is an orally active dmt.</v>

1843
01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.030
<v Speaker 5>So dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Normally when you eat it,</v>

1844
01:16:55.330 --> 01:16:56.163
<v Speaker 5>your body produces something in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>digestive digestive track called mano </v>

1845
01:17:00.131 --> 01:17:01.900
<v Speaker 5>aiming oxidate the blocks it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1846
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:02.783
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what iowasca is dmt from one </v>

1847
01:17:06.071 --> 01:17:06.904
<v Speaker 5>plant and an mao inhibitor for another </v>
<v Speaker 5>plant and combine it together and they </v>

1848
01:17:10.341 --> 01:17:11.174
<v Speaker 5>create an orally active dmt because </v>
<v Speaker 5>otherwise you'd just be tripping every </v>

1849
01:17:14.361 --> 01:17:16.460
<v Speaker 5>time you eat a salad like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1850
01:17:16.461 --> 01:17:18.650
<v Speaker 5>you get some wheat grass juice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you chip your balls off,</v>

1851
01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:19.723
<v Speaker 5>but your body keeps that from happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the purpose of that dmt and what it </v>

1852
01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:28.280
<v Speaker 5>does in human neurochemistry is not </v>
<v Speaker 5>really understood that well,</v>

1853
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.233
<v Speaker 5>but what they do know now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of rick strassman and the work </v>

1854
01:17:31.131 --> 01:17:31.964
<v Speaker 5>of the cottonwood research foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a foundation that's dedicated </v>

1855
01:17:35.391 --> 01:17:39.290
<v Speaker 5>to exploring these subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've found that in live rats,</v>

1856
01:17:39.650 --> 01:17:40.970
<v Speaker 5>rats or mice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget which one,</v>

1857
01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:46.010
<v Speaker 5>that they've proven that their pineal </v>
<v Speaker 5>gland is producing dimethyltryptamine,</v>

1858
01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.360
<v Speaker 5>which is what they've always.</v>

1859
01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:48.323
<v Speaker 5>It's always been anecdotal evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so now they know that it's not just </v>

1860
01:17:50.811 --> 01:17:51.644
<v Speaker 5>produced by the liver and the lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also produced by this little </v>

1861
01:17:53.391 --> 01:17:58.370
<v Speaker 5>gland and this little gland.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They think during near death experiences</v>

1862
01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:02.150
<v Speaker 5>and during heavy rem sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's producing dmt.</v>

1863
01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:03.013
<v Speaker 5>How much they don't really know because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they would have to get in there and </v>

1864
01:18:05.631 --> 01:18:06.464
<v Speaker 5>they'd have to somehow or another figure</v>
<v Speaker 5>out a way to measure it while you were </v>

1865
01:18:08.931 --> 01:18:09.764
<v Speaker 5>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They haven't figured out how to do that </v>

1866
01:18:11.001 --> 01:18:12.410
<v Speaker 5>yet because it's in the center of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>head.</v>

1867
01:18:12.411 --> 01:18:13.244
<v Speaker 5>They'd have to drill and tap it and who </v>
<v Speaker 5>knows how the fuck they could do that </v>

1868
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:17.203
<v Speaker 5>with today's technology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but maybe someday in the future they'll </v>

1869
01:18:18.641 --> 01:18:19.790
<v Speaker 5>be able to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1870
01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:20.843
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm fascinated by it ever since </v>
<v Speaker 5>listening to you talk about it and then </v>

1871
01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:28.910
<v Speaker 5>watching your documentary on dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the spirit molecule molecule,</v>

1872
01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.680
<v Speaker 5>and it was all based on strassman's </v>
<v Speaker 5>work.</v>

1873
01:18:30.930 --> 01:18:31.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I mean it's,</v>

1874
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:34.220
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I tried it one time and it was,</v>

1875
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:35.443
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was unlike anything for the 10 </v>

1876
01:18:37.041 --> 01:18:39.230
<v Speaker 5>minutes I've ever experienced in my </v>
<v Speaker 5>entire life.</v>

1877
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:41.180
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so it was,</v>

1878
01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:42.493
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after that I've obviously read all this </v>

1879
01:18:43.271 --> 01:18:44.540
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Try to,</v>

1880
01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:45.433
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's interesting is I think no one </v>

1881
01:18:46.971 --> 01:18:49.640
<v Speaker 5>will probably ever know until you do it </v>
<v Speaker 5>or no,</v>

1882
01:18:49.641 --> 01:18:53.980
<v Speaker 5>I just mean like there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a phenomenon happening.</v>

1883
01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:58.790
<v Speaker 5>we as humans can't possibly understand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will never understand in our lifetime.</v>

1884
01:18:59.000 --> 01:18:59.631
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1885
01:18:59.631 --> 01:19:00.770
<v Speaker 5>there's two different ways of looking at</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1886
01:19:00.771 --> 01:19:01.604
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One is that it's a human neurochemistry </v>

1887
01:19:04.210 --> 01:19:05.043
<v Speaker 5>and that there's a chemical that is just</v>
<v Speaker 5>producing these crazy visuals and it's </v>

1888
01:19:08.241 --> 01:19:10.610
<v Speaker 5>just all the meaning attached to is just</v>
<v Speaker 5>your own.</v>

1889
01:19:11.150 --> 01:19:11.983
<v Speaker 5>And then the other way of looking at it </v>
<v Speaker 5>is it's some sort of a chemical gateway </v>

1890
01:19:14.631 --> 01:19:18.730
<v Speaker 5>into the afterlife life and that what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're seeing is like the souls of these</v>

1891
01:19:18.731 --> 01:19:19.564
<v Speaker 5>people that have lived before and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that have ever lived like a </v>

1892
01:19:21.911 --> 01:19:25.390
<v Speaker 5>sea of souls and I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's right or who's wrong,</v>

1893
01:19:25.391 --> 01:19:26.224
<v Speaker 5>but it's impossible to describe like </v>
<v Speaker 5>describe it as just like you're just </v>

1894
01:19:30.190 --> 01:19:31.570
<v Speaker 5>throwing words around.</v>

1895
01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:32.980
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't work,</v>

1896
01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:35.830
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's produced by your own body.</v>

1897
01:19:35.831 --> 01:19:37.930
<v Speaker 5>that's the weirdest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody has it.</v>

1898
01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:39.830
<v Speaker 5>Like terence mckenna used to joke about </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1899
01:19:39.831 --> 01:19:43.060
<v Speaker 5>He said everybody's holding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a schedule one compound,</v>

1900
01:19:43.061 --> 01:19:45.100
<v Speaker 5>but everybody tests positive for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's,</v>

1901
01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.420
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's illegal but illegal.</v>

1902
01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.870
<v Speaker 5>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do they,</v>

1903
01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:52.330
<v Speaker 5>how do they decide what it's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>illegal if it's,</v>

1904
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:53.323
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's a plant based problem that is </v>

1905
01:19:54.521 --> 01:19:55.354
<v Speaker 5>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just plants that all contain it are all </v>

1906
01:19:57.741 --> 01:19:58.990
<v Speaker 5>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all,</v>

1907
01:19:59.170 --> 01:20:02.770
<v Speaker 5>they are all legal and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>illegal,</v>

1908
01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:05.860
<v Speaker 5>but it's in all these legal plants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's in thousands of plants.</v>

1909
01:20:05.861 --> 01:20:06.694
<v Speaker 5>That's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you can have a san pedro </v>

1910
01:20:09.391 --> 01:20:12.180
<v Speaker 5>cactus and keep it in your house and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's like,</v>

1911
01:20:12.181 --> 01:20:13.020
<v Speaker 5>what's that like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1912
01:20:13.021 --> 01:20:16.430
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty cactus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1913
01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:19.530
<v Speaker 5>But it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's drugs in that fucking cactus.</v>

1914
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:25.040
<v Speaker 5>I meAn that's where mescalin comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Comes from that trip your balls off from</v>

1915
01:20:26.761 --> 01:20:28.650
<v Speaker 5>a fucking cactus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

1916
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:31.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean when the pod rituals,</v>

1917
01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:32.453
<v Speaker 5>that's from a cactus san pedro cactus is</v>
<v Speaker 5>this in the same thing as pay and so I </v>

1918
01:20:36.621 --> 01:20:38.490
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see if you can google that.</v>

1919
01:20:38.491 --> 01:20:39.324
<v Speaker 5>Jamie pay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe that pod and masculine or </v>

1920
01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:43.980
<v Speaker 5>slang or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it?</v>

1921
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:45.143
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Masculine is occurs naturally in the </v>

1922
01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:47.763
<v Speaker 5>pod.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cactus.</v>

1923
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:48.623
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you could have that cactus in your </v>

1924
01:20:49.741 --> 01:20:51.330
<v Speaker 5>house and you're basically a drug </v>
<v Speaker 5>dealer,</v>

1925
01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.470
<v Speaker 5>but meanwhile you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a little old lady.</v>

1926
01:20:53.471 --> 01:20:55.490
<v Speaker 5>You enjoy succulents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1927
01:20:55.870 --> 01:21:00.870
<v Speaker 5>like go out of town for a week and come </v>
<v Speaker 5>back and it's fine.</v>

1928
01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.513
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's a really cool looking cactus </v>

1929
01:21:03.511 --> 01:21:05.850
<v Speaker 5>that people keep in their yard all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time in la.</v>

1930
01:21:06.170 --> 01:21:07.003
<v Speaker 5>Like one of the things in la because of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the drought that we have for so many </v>

1931
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:11.670
<v Speaker 5>years until this year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is awesome.</v>

1932
01:21:11.670 --> 01:21:13.080
<v Speaker 5>Everything looks like New Zealand out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there now.</v>

1933
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.600
<v Speaker 5>It is nice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people would have these uh,</v>

1934
01:21:15.690 --> 01:21:16.523
<v Speaker 5>hardscapes in their yards where they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have just have rocks and succulents and </v>

1935
01:21:20.401 --> 01:21:21.234
<v Speaker 5>cactus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's a lot of people that have </v>

1936
01:21:22.231 --> 01:21:23.850
<v Speaker 5>those cactuses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that cactus.</v>

1937
01:21:24.150 --> 01:21:26.040
<v Speaker 5>You could go meet jesus with that </v>
<v Speaker 5>cactus.</v>

1938
01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:28.440
<v Speaker 5>Have you done it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1939
01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:29.820
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no dumb pot.</v>

1940
01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:31.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That seems a,</v>

1941
01:21:31.450 --> 01:21:33.480
<v Speaker 5>it seems like a pRetty cool long time </v>
<v Speaker 5>though,</v>

1942
01:21:33.481 --> 01:21:35.760
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the longer ones I think.</v>

1943
01:21:35.761 --> 01:21:36.594
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a few hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but so as iowasca haven't done that </v>

1944
01:21:40.201 --> 01:21:41.550
<v Speaker 5>either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've only done the dmt.</v>

1945
01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:45.210
<v Speaker 5>Dmt is like a shorter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more potent form of it,</v>

1946
01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:49.470
<v Speaker 5>but I've done it several times over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>course of an evening where it's like,</v>

1947
01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:53.640
<v Speaker 5>been like a couple hour experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you feel like it's obviously,</v>

1948
01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who have done it,</v>

1949
01:21:55.051 --> 01:21:55.884
<v Speaker 5>they know it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not something that you're doing </v>

1950
01:21:57.420 --> 01:21:59.130
<v Speaker 5>recreationally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's something that's like,</v>

1951
01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:00.750
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you do this this one time,</v>

1952
01:22:00.751 --> 01:22:02.160
<v Speaker 5>it's or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

1953
01:22:02.161 --> 01:22:03.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a couple of times.</v>

1954
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.890
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you're out going to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>club.</v>

1955
01:22:05.190 --> 01:22:06.300
<v Speaker 5>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1956
01:22:06.301 --> 01:22:07.134
<v Speaker 5>It's a very spiritual sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You do that word spiritual is so beaten </v>

1957
01:22:11.581 --> 01:22:12.414
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's oNe of those words that I don't </v>

1958
01:22:13.441 --> 01:22:15.720
<v Speaker 5>even like to use because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1959
01:22:15.721 --> 01:22:17.970
<v Speaker 5>It's like so many people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I'm not religious,</v>

1960
01:22:17.971 --> 01:22:20.730
<v Speaker 5>but I'm spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It almost seems like,</v>

1961
01:22:21.450 --> 01:22:22.283
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like they get a spiritual </v>

1962
01:22:23.161 --> 01:22:24.900
<v Speaker 5>gangster shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm about to throw away as soon as I get</v>

1963
01:22:24.901 --> 01:22:26.730
<v Speaker 5>home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe rogan says not cool.</v>

1964
01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:27.631
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not that.</v>

1965
01:22:27.631 --> 01:22:28.500
<v Speaker 5>It's not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

1966
01:22:28.530 --> 01:22:31.650
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of been cooptive by nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1967
01:22:31.950 --> 01:22:34.200
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and not even nonsense intentionally.</v>

1968
01:22:34.201 --> 01:22:35.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people say that they,</v>

1969
01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:36.413
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll say things and they don't mean </v>

1970
01:22:37.441 --> 01:22:38.274
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not that they're lying or they're </v>

1971
01:22:40.051 --> 01:22:40.884
<v Speaker 5>being deceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just that it's such a problematic </v>

1972
01:22:42.721 --> 01:22:43.554
<v Speaker 5>word.</v>

1973
01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:44.251
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1974
01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:45.540
<v Speaker 5>What I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I mean,</v>

1975
01:22:45.541 --> 01:22:47.340
<v Speaker 5>I guess I can say better is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is uh,</v>

1976
01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:48.593
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a experience that is something </v>

1977
01:22:53.381 --> 01:22:55.020
<v Speaker 5>that's very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very brief.</v>

1978
01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:56.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's profound and,</v>

1979
01:22:56.521 --> 01:22:59.030
<v Speaker 5>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to sort of do it and,</v>

1980
01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:03.340
<v Speaker 5>and talk about it and have a collective </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of discussion about it.</v>

1981
01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:04.733
<v Speaker 5>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's also a real problem with </v>

1982
01:23:06.131 --> 01:23:06.964
<v Speaker 5>perception,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially amongst people that haven't </v>

1983
01:23:08.231 --> 01:23:09.064
<v Speaker 5>experienced psychedelic drugs that when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you say the word drug or each day </v>

1984
01:23:12.401 --> 01:23:13.234
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic compounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe because when you say the word </v>

1985
01:23:14.591 --> 01:23:16.960
<v Speaker 5>drug,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people automatically have in their head,</v>

1986
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:18.550
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a weak person.</v>

1987
01:23:18.551 --> 01:23:19.384
<v Speaker 5>You're trying to hide from reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know that you're trying to shield </v>

1988
01:23:22.001 --> 01:23:22.834
<v Speaker 5>your sale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just trying to get high and just </v>

1989
01:23:23.501 --> 01:23:26.590
<v Speaker 5>lay around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I only want to be here,</v>

1990
01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:29.770
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Couldn't be further from the truth.</v>

1991
01:23:29.890 --> 01:23:30.723
<v Speaker 5>It's like one of the most self </v>
<v Speaker 5>exploratory opening and deeply </v>

1992
01:23:34.181 --> 01:23:38.470
<v Speaker 5>disturbing and it's profound and </v>
<v Speaker 5>powerful effects.</v>

1993
01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:42.100
<v Speaker 5>It's very shocking and you leave it </v>
<v Speaker 5>once.</v>

1994
01:23:42.101 --> 01:23:44.020
<v Speaker 5>It's over you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a different person,</v>

1995
01:23:44.021 --> 01:23:44.854
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that you just,</v>

1996
01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:47.230
<v Speaker 5>now that you know that that's a real </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibility,</v>

1997
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:49.660
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be a different person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1998
01:23:49.810 --> 01:23:50.643
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I was maybe won't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it mean it depends on where </v>

1999
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.880
<v Speaker 5>you're coming into it and then what kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of defense mechanisms you have,</v>

2000
01:23:57.881 --> 01:24:01.690
<v Speaker 5>what kind of an ego you have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether or not you can just realize like</v>

2001
01:24:01.691 --> 01:24:02.524
<v Speaker 5>now that you've seen this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that life will never be the </v>

2002
01:24:05.891 --> 01:24:06.724
<v Speaker 5>same again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're always going to know that that's </v>

2003
01:24:08.021 --> 01:24:08.854
<v Speaker 5>a possibility that you can smoke this </v>
<v Speaker 5>crystal powder that is extracted from </v>

2004
01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.073
<v Speaker 5>plants and when you smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're transported to a world of love </v>

2005
01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:20.254
<v Speaker 5>and understanding and geometric patterns</v>
<v Speaker 5>of infinite description to the point </v>

2006
01:24:25.241 --> 01:24:26.760
<v Speaker 5>where like you can't even describe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't.</v>

2007
01:24:26.970 --> 01:24:28.870
<v Speaker 5>You don't even know what you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 5>at while you're looking at it.</v>

2008
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:33.610
<v Speaker 5>It's just so beyond like lifts the veil </v>
<v Speaker 5>on what we think is reality.</v>

2009
01:24:33.730 --> 01:24:35.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it might be heaven,</v>

2010
01:24:35.410 --> 01:24:37.360
<v Speaker 5>it might be the afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really might be.</v>

2011
01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:39.700
<v Speaker 5>It might be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There might be a reason why people think</v>

2012
01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:40.893
<v Speaker 5>that heaven is filled with ultimate love</v>
<v Speaker 5>because people have had near death </v>

2013
01:24:43.541 --> 01:24:44.374
<v Speaker 5>experiences and they've come back with </v>
<v Speaker 5>these stories and during those near </v>

2014
01:24:46.391 --> 01:24:47.224
<v Speaker 5>death experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's entirely possible not just </v>

2015
01:24:49.661 --> 01:24:50.950
<v Speaker 5>speculative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not just like.</v>

2016
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:51.833
<v Speaker 5>It might absolutely be that your brain </v>
<v Speaker 5>is producing this dimethyltryptamine </v>

2017
01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:59.460
<v Speaker 5>that had already produced in high doses </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's what it's there for.</v>

2018
01:25:00.190 --> 01:25:02.920
<v Speaker 5>We don't know for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you've done it.</v>

2019
01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:04.150
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2020
01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:06.940
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people have done it now by more</v>
<v Speaker 5>people than ever.</v>

2021
01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:09.790
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy in history for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

2022
01:25:09.791 --> 01:25:10.624
<v Speaker 5>More people listening to this now have </v>
<v Speaker 5>experienced dmt than probably at any </v>

2023
01:25:14.831 --> 01:25:16.030
<v Speaker 5>time in human history</v>

2024
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.861
<v Speaker 4>and it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2025
01:25:16.861 --> 01:25:18.820
<v Speaker 4>I tell people when they ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2026
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:21.610
<v Speaker 4>if you haven't done it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should do it because it's,</v>

2027
01:25:21.670 --> 01:25:23.530
<v Speaker 4>it's mind opening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2028
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:24.091
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2029
01:25:24.091 --> 01:25:25.390
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You realize that you.</v>

2030
01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:26.430
<v Speaker 4>It's humbling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think to,</v>

2031
01:25:26.431 --> 01:25:28.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot we don't understand what's</v>

2032
01:25:28.861 --> 01:25:31.620
<v Speaker 4>happening and then we may never </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand and,</v>

2033
01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:35.760
<v Speaker 4>and to be so closed minded to think we </v>
<v Speaker 4>know one path or the other,</v>

2034
01:25:35.761 --> 01:25:37.800
<v Speaker 4>what's the right thing or the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2035
01:25:38.130 --> 01:25:39.570
<v Speaker 4>It's just really arrogant.</v>

2036
01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:42.640
<v Speaker 5>It's very ego shattering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very ego shattering and it also,</v>

2037
01:25:42.641 --> 01:25:45.190
<v Speaker 5>once you know that that's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's like,</v>

2038
01:25:45.191 --> 01:25:46.024
<v Speaker 5>how is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How Is it possible that you're just 30 </v>

2039
01:25:47.861 --> 01:25:49.970
<v Speaker 5>seconds away from that at any time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2040
01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:51.120
<v Speaker 5>it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2068
01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:52.220

<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2069
01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:54.030
<v Speaker 5>Bisping was drunk.</v>

<v Speaker 5>why would bisbing be upset that I talk </v>

2075
01:27:04.401 --> 01:27:05.234
<v Speaker 5>about beer?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or I talk about pot when he's always </v>

2076
01:27:06.681 --> 01:27:07.514
<v Speaker 5>talking about beer.</v>

2077
01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:09.890
<v Speaker 5>That's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that's not true.</v>

2078
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:11.900
<v Speaker 5>What'd you sure.</v>

2081
01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:19.123
<v Speaker 5>Nick diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's probably trying to get a fight </v>

2082
01:27:20.301 --> 01:27:22.430
<v Speaker 5>with nick diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's probably what it is.</v>

2083
01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:26.300
<v Speaker 5>Maybe england for a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I figured you would've seen it though.</v>

2084
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.970
<v Speaker 5>I love michael.</v>

<v Speaker 5>that guy is tough as shit,</v>

2086
01:27:30.681 --> 01:27:32.300
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can't even see out of one eye.</v>

2087
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:34.520
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got one of the top fucked up.</v>

2088
01:27:34.521 --> 01:27:35.354
<v Speaker 5>They filled it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did an operation on it and then </v>

2089
01:27:36.591 --> 01:27:39.260
<v Speaker 5>filled it up with oil so that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2090
01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:42.530
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The retina doesn't rupture again when,</v>

2091
01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he's fighting gsp.</v>

2092
01:27:44.271 --> 01:27:45.104
<v Speaker 5>When is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do we know when they do not have a date </v>

2093
01:27:46.670 --> 01:27:47.503
<v Speaker 5>but trying to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But bisping has said that if gsp can't </v>

2094
01:27:49.971 --> 01:27:51.860
<v Speaker 5>make it by july,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'll find somebody else.</v>

2095
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:53.383
<v Speaker 5>So he might fight michael bisping blast </v>
<v Speaker 5>joe rogan and nick diaz for positively </v>

2096
01:27:57.621 --> 01:27:59.280
<v Speaker 5>promoting cannabis told ya.</v>

2097
01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.710
<v Speaker 5>But that might not be real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2098
01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:05.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by saying blasts,</v>

2099
01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:08.030

<v Speaker 5>said.</v>

2100
01:28:08.031 --> 01:28:10.370
<v Speaker 5>I can't tell what it's from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all click bait nowadays.</v>

2101
01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:14.150
<v Speaker 5>She might've just seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might have literally an oh,</v>

2102
01:28:14.151 --> 01:28:15.620
<v Speaker 5>he's probably hanging out with joe </v>
<v Speaker 5>rogan.</v>

2103
01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:17.553
<v Speaker 5>See that?</v>

2108
01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:33.440
<v Speaker 5>because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if some people have said it</v>

2109
01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:35.510
<v Speaker 5>in popular,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Do you remember the,</v>

2113
01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:48.390
<v Speaker 5>you saved me from a bear attack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was,</v>

2114
01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.110
<v Speaker 5>there was a ha.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got attacked by a bear.</v>

2115
01:28:51.111 --> 01:28:55.790
<v Speaker 5>Joe shot the bear and there's a whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>article that was all it was.</v>

2116
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:58.880
<v Speaker 5>I got one that said I killed a mountain </v>
<v Speaker 5>line with my belt.</v>

2117
01:28:59.030 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a house in pasadena.</v>

2118
01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:02.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2119
01:29:02.930 --> 01:29:04.560
<v Speaker 4>Do you do what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you,</v>

2120
01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:06.110
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you think that it's,</v>

2121
01:29:06.530 --> 01:29:07.363
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2122
01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:08.953
<v Speaker 4>I mean all that stuff is pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think there should be controls </v>

2123
01:29:11.661 --> 01:29:13.730
<v Speaker 4>over it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like just outside of being,</v>

2124
01:29:13.731 --> 01:29:14.391
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fcc,</v>

2125
01:29:14.391 --> 01:29:16.190
<v Speaker 4>being able to like sue people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

2126
01:29:16.191 --> 01:29:18.080
<v Speaker 4>That never really happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>IT feels like.</v>

2127
01:29:18.081 --> 01:29:18.920
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that it should.</v>

2128
01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:23.380
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like things like the onion,</v>

2129
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:25.300
<v Speaker 5>it's like when do you draw the line?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the onion,</v>

2130
01:29:25.301 --> 01:29:26.134
<v Speaker 5>it's hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they'll make a like a subtle parody </v>

2131
01:29:28.031 --> 01:29:28.864
<v Speaker 5>of something and make it completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>preposterous and then pull up a good </v>

2132
01:29:32.051 --> 01:29:35.860
<v Speaker 5>example of an onion headline was like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the onion.</v>

2133
01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:39.400
<v Speaker 5>Do you don't know what the onion is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The onion is a famous parody,</v>

2134
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:42.610
<v Speaker 5>new site where they make stories that </v>
<v Speaker 5>just.</v>

2135
01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:43.743
<v Speaker 5>If you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you read it and you go what the bear </v>

2136
01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.870
<v Speaker 5>somebody who is making an parody on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2137
01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:50.020
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In a way.</v>

2138
01:29:50.021 --> 01:29:50.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2139
01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:51.663
<v Speaker 5>And most of them are pretty humorous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but occasionally people will tweet me </v>

2140
01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:59.110
<v Speaker 5>with like an onion store and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you fucking believe this shit man,</v>

2141
01:29:59.170 --> 01:30:03.170
<v Speaker 5>it's good now to control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you read it and go dummy,</v>

2142
01:30:03.171 --> 01:30:05.740
<v Speaker 5>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is comedy writing.</v>

2143
01:30:05.890 --> 01:30:07.120
<v Speaker 5>People don't have common sense.</v>

2144
01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:07.953
<v Speaker 5>So that's a problem with that quickbase </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff as they believe it because they </v>

2145
01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:12.160
<v Speaker 5>can't read it and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

2146
01:30:12.161 --> 01:30:15.190
<v Speaker 5>that's probably whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just like they believe everything.</v>

2147
01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:17.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean isn't that the case with like</v>

2148
01:30:17.471 --> 01:30:18.304
<v Speaker 5>cults in the moonies and scientology and</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's a lot of nonsense that </v>

2149
01:30:21.791 --> 01:30:22.624
<v Speaker 5>people believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not hard to get people to believe </v>

2150
01:30:24.641 --> 01:30:25.900
<v Speaker 5>in shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

2151
01:30:25.901 --> 01:30:27.520
<v Speaker 5>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what do we do about it?</v>

2152
01:30:27.521 --> 01:30:30.130
<v Speaker 5>Do you leave it up to common sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which isn't very common today,</v>

2153
01:30:30.850 --> 01:30:35.380
<v Speaker 5>or do you do step in rookie justice gore</v>
<v Speaker 5>such.</v>

2154
01:30:35.410 --> 01:30:37.780
<v Speaker 5>How do you say his name assigned to </v>
<v Speaker 5>supreme court.</v>

2155
01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:40.150
<v Speaker 5>Overnight shift a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

2156
01:30:40.151 --> 01:30:43.600
<v Speaker 5>because he's a new supreme court guy and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're giving them the shitty gig.</v>

2157
01:30:43.930 --> 01:30:44.890
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not real,</v>

2158
01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:46.360
<v Speaker 5>but if somebody read that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were like,</v>

2159
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:48.070
<v Speaker 5>this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These fucking liberals.</v>

2160
01:30:48.250 --> 01:30:49.690
<v Speaker 5>They're just because she's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>conservative.</v>

2161
01:30:49.691 --> 01:30:50.524
<v Speaker 5>They're putting it on the night shift.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Night shift man tries using pink six </v>

2162
01:30:55.421 --> 01:30:59.840
<v Speaker 5>pound bowling ball to great amusement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not really to see like.</v>

2163
01:30:59.841 --> 01:31:00.674
<v Speaker 5>It's like what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They write these articles that are </v>

2164
01:31:02.471 --> 01:31:03.304
<v Speaker 5>comedy.</v>

2165
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:06.850
<v Speaker 4>They fake their poses news,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a little.</v>

2166
01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:08.530
<v Speaker 4>I think it's different because right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have.</v>

2167
01:31:08.970 --> 01:31:13.970
<v Speaker 4>If your fiction and you're posing as as </v>
<v Speaker 4>real news,</v>

2168

<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It feels.</v>

2171
01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:28.320
<v Speaker 4>It feels like there are some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just feels like there's a,</v>

2172
01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:30.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just an ad.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what they've always been able to </v>

2207
01:32:31.751 --> 01:32:34.810
<v Speaker 5>do with those supermarket tabloids say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>allegedly from a source.</v>

2208
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:38.910
<v Speaker 5>A source tells us that campaigns likes </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be careful here.</v>

2209
01:32:39.010 --> 01:32:40.690
<v Speaker 5>Exactly what I'm saying.</v>

2210

2213
01:32:50.681 --> 01:32:51.514
<v Speaker 5>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a weird time and it's a weird time </v>

2214
01:32:53.681 --> 01:32:57.490
<v Speaker 5>because essentially the boundaries to </v>
<v Speaker 5>publication have been dissolved.</v>

2215
01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:58.653
<v Speaker 5>It used to be that you had to work for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the New York times or the Washington </v>

2216
01:33:01.241 --> 01:33:02.740
<v Speaker 5>post or a newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2217
01:33:03.070 --> 01:33:07.390
<v Speaker 5>Now just all you need is a blog or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>facebook page and your breaking news,</v>

2218
01:33:07.391 --> 01:33:09.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and just scott eastwood admits to,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wearing women's clothes while you're </v>

<v Speaker 5>hunting for deer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Larry,</v>

<v Speaker 5>larry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>david,</v>

2222
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:16.350
<v Speaker 5>larry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>david.</v>

2223
01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:17.290
<v Speaker 5>I wear women's underwear.</v>

2224
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:21.460
<v Speaker 5>One of the best line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was strange.</v>

2225
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.630
<v Speaker 5>It is definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>

2226
01:33:22.631 --> 01:33:23.770
<v Speaker 5>It's definitely strange,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>

2227
01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:25.780
<v Speaker 5>but who's to decide?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2228
01:33:25.781 --> 01:33:28.210
<v Speaker 5>I know tHey're trying to work on some </v>
<v Speaker 5>ways to figure it out.</v>

2229
01:33:28.211 --> 01:33:32.740
<v Speaker 5>I know facebook is working on some </v>
<v Speaker 5>different ways to block fake news,</v>

2230
01:33:32.741 --> 01:33:36.130
<v Speaker 5>but who's to decide what's fake and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what's real and who's to decide where it</v>

2231
01:33:36.131 --> 01:33:38.350
<v Speaker 5>becomes parody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When is it funny?</v>

2232
01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:39.213
<v Speaker 5>Like when is it the onion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it's pretty subtle and when is it </v>

2233
01:33:41.471 --> 01:33:43.810
<v Speaker 5>just some guy making up a story about </v>
<v Speaker 5>you?</v>

2234
01:33:43.870 --> 01:33:47.140
<v Speaker 5>Me saving you from a bear attack when </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's weird.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I know I'm ronald sweater.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2236
01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:50.803
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm really.</v>

2237
01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:52.840
<v Speaker 5>I'm really concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2238
01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:53.993
<v Speaker 5>y'all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2239
01:33:54.330 --> 01:33:56.130
<v Speaker 5>like asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2240
01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:59.620
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a weird sign of the times.</v>

2241
01:33:59.830 --> 01:34:03.450
<v Speaker 5>The times are weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have weird times and this,</v>

2242
01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:04.553
<v Speaker 5>the ability to communicate where anybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>can do anything at any time and not </v>

2243
01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:08.980
<v Speaker 5>everybody could find out about it.</v>

2244
01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:11.560
<v Speaker 5>Like you could write something on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>twitter page,</v>

2245
01:34:11.710 --> 01:34:12.543
<v Speaker 5>just publish it and then it gets to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>right amount of people and then they </v>

2246
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:19.670
<v Speaker 5>share it and then all of a sudden a </v>
<v Speaker 5>million people have seen it inside of an</v>

2247
01:34:19.670 --> 01:34:21.820
<v Speaker 5>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I know it's crazy,</v>

2248
01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:25.600
<v Speaker 5>but it's good to get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we've used that for our benefit.</v>

2249
01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:28.720
<v Speaker 5>That's what you do all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I do have a voice.</v>

2250
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:29.583
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this made you have a vo or me have a </v>

2251
01:34:31.691 --> 01:34:32.381
<v Speaker 5>voice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2252
01:34:32.381 --> 01:34:34.630
<v Speaker 5>you've always had one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but make me have one.</v>

2253
01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:37.060
<v Speaker 5>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an amazing time to.</v>

2254
01:34:37.210 --> 01:34:38.043
<v Speaker 5>Well even my voice is a way different </v>
<v Speaker 5>now like having a podcast and that's </v>

2255
01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:41.593
<v Speaker 5>much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>much in a lot of ways the same thing </v>

2256
01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.200
<v Speaker 5>because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is a pretty lean operation.</v>

2257
01:34:47.201 --> 01:34:49.470
<v Speaker 5>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just a surprise,</v>

2258
01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:51.910
<v Speaker 5>just a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2259
01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:56.950
<v Speaker 5>a jamie to figure it out and then we </v>
<v Speaker 5>talk and then upload it.</v>

2260
01:34:57.770 --> 01:34:58.640
<v Speaker 5>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

2261
01:34:58.970 --> 01:35:01.490
<v Speaker 5>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's not a whole lot of steps and yet</v>

2262
01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:03.440
<v Speaker 5>this will probably get 5 million </v>
<v Speaker 5>downloads,</v>

2263
01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:04.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe even more.</v>

2264
01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:05.750
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

2265
01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:06.633
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's weird in that sense that it can </v>

2266
01:35:07.641 --> 01:35:10.440
<v Speaker 5>reach so many different people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then it's,</v>

2267
01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:12.890
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no corporation behind it,</v>

2268
01:35:12.891 --> 01:35:13.724
<v Speaker 5>there's no Washington post.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we could just sit here and just make </v>

2269
01:35:15.141 --> 01:35:18.800
<v Speaker 5>up a bunch of fake shit and just be </v>
<v Speaker 5>really adamant that this really happened</v>

2270
01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:22.690
<v Speaker 5>and they were going to leave it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And how could,</v>

2271
01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:25.130
<v Speaker 5>could someone stop you from doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if theY could,</v>

2272
01:35:25.131 --> 01:35:27.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as long as you're not slandering anybody</v>

2273
01:35:27.081 --> 01:35:29.300
<v Speaker 5>and you're not getting sued.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I did want.</v>

2274
01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.220
<v Speaker 5>So what's your prediction if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2275
01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:36.370
<v Speaker 5>if bisbing and gsp fight very </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting fight because bisping's been</v>

2276
01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:37.213
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2277
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:41.840
<v Speaker 5>a battler a warrior for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's been very active and he's,</v>

2278
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:44.840
<v Speaker 5>he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a very likable,</v>

2279
01:35:44.850 --> 01:35:46.940
<v Speaker 5>Well honed machine right now.</v>

2280
01:35:46.970 --> 01:35:50.150
<v Speaker 5>Whereas gsps been out of the loop for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>solid three years.</v>

2281
01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:52.490
<v Speaker 5>No competition at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

2282
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:53.623
<v Speaker 5>he's been training the entire time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So gsp is not a guy who sits around and </v>

2283
01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.800
<v Speaker 5>gets fat and it gets nothing done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2284
01:36:00.801 --> 01:36:05.000
<v Speaker 5>he's constantly training.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then again,</v>

2285
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:08.930
<v Speaker 5>he stopped because he was having memory </v>
<v Speaker 5>issues and head injury.</v>

2286
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he got hit.</v>

2287
01:36:10.511 --> 01:36:14.270
<v Speaker 5>He had 800 plus times over the course of</v>
<v Speaker 5>his ufc career,</v>

2288
01:36:14.271 --> 01:36:15.104
<v Speaker 5>hendricks fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He got hit in the head about 10,000 </v>

2289
01:36:17.151 --> 01:36:17.984
<v Speaker 5>times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seemed like he was a mess after that </v>

2290
01:36:19.281 --> 01:36:21.500
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just been a mess.</v>

2291
01:36:21.501 --> 01:36:22.334
<v Speaker 5>After a few fights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>know carlos condit had kicked him and </v>

2292
01:36:25.221 --> 01:36:26.150
<v Speaker 5>knocked him down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2293
01:36:26.151 --> 01:36:28.680
<v Speaker 5>he's got some wars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Matt serra knocked him out,</v>

2294
01:36:28.730 --> 01:36:29.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's weird.</v>

2295
01:36:29.991 --> 01:36:33.140
<v Speaker 5>It feels like gsp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's been the champion,</v>

2296
01:36:33.141 --> 01:36:33.974
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't feel like he's doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have that champion respect for whatever </v>

2297
01:36:38.421 --> 01:36:38.930
<v Speaker 5>reason.</v>

2298
01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:40.790
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's because his last fight with hendrix</v>

2299
01:36:40.791 --> 01:36:43.580
<v Speaker 5>was super close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've been controversial.</v>

2300
01:36:43.730 --> 01:36:45.470
<v Speaker 5>I did the fight companion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2301
01:36:45.471 --> 01:36:47.570
<v Speaker 5>not to that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was there for that fight.</v>

2302
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:51.800
<v Speaker 5>Hendrick's not hendrick's last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about gsps last fight.</v>

2303
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:52.663
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was talking about [inaudible] being </v>

2304
01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:55.120
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2305
01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:58.370
<v Speaker 5>and henderson fight that one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Henderson,</v>

2306
01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:01.880
<v Speaker 5>that's when eddie bravo went full tower </v>
<v Speaker 5>seven and he got super drunk.</v>

2307
01:37:01.881 --> 01:37:03.680
<v Speaker 5>Was worried the illuminati it was going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to come and get us.</v>

2308
01:37:04.150 --> 01:37:05.420
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>

2309
01:37:06.190 --> 01:37:09.110
<v Speaker 5>And I said knockouts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're better than submissions I think.</v>

2310
01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:14.160
<v Speaker 5>Well a lot of people like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But gsps last fight with johny hendricks</v>

2311
01:37:14.811 --> 01:37:15.644
<v Speaker 5>who's super close,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super close fight and gsp retired with </v>

2312
01:37:18.441 --> 01:37:19.250
<v Speaker 5>the belt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2313
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:20.990
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought he lost that fight.</v>

2314
01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:21.853
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean a lot of people to a lot of </v>

2315
01:37:24.081 --> 01:37:24.914
<v Speaker 5>people did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2316
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:28.100
<v Speaker 5>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't like this big victory.</v>

2317
01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:32.840
<v Speaker 5>It's not like the way he beat down bj </v>
<v Speaker 5>penn and stopped him and if he said then</v>

2318
01:37:32.841 --> 01:37:34.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to retire.</v>

2319
01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:35.690
<v Speaker 5>I had a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you very much.</v>

2320
01:37:35.691 --> 01:37:36.790
<v Speaker 5>Everybody would blood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2321
01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:37.653
<v Speaker 5>we love you george.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But instead it was a close fight and </v>

2322
01:37:39.611 --> 01:37:41.750
<v Speaker 5>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no man,</v>

2323
01:37:41.751 --> 01:37:42.584
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he got the belt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe maybe show went out with a loss </v>

2324
01:37:45.201 --> 01:37:46.510
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows that,</v>

2325
01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:50.300
<v Speaker 5>but don't you think brisbane doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have that championship type respect?</v>

2326
01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:51.493
<v Speaker 5>He does not right noW.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the reason he does not because he </v>

2327
01:37:53.631 --> 01:37:58.631
<v Speaker 5>defended against henderson wasn't really</v>
<v Speaker 5>ranked that high and he really shouldn't</v>

2328
01:37:58.891 --> 01:38:00.630
<v Speaker 5>have got a title shot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was a rematch,</v>

2329
01:38:00.650 --> 01:38:01.483
<v Speaker 5>one of the most epic knockouts ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>because henderson flatlined him and </v>

2330
01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:06.960
<v Speaker 5>punched him in the head while he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>down and flew through the air.</v>

2331
01:38:06.961 --> 01:38:07.794
<v Speaker 5>And that's henderson's logo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now henderson's logo is literally a </v>

2332
01:38:10.501 --> 01:38:12.840
<v Speaker 5>silhouette of his body flying through </v>
<v Speaker 5>the air,</v>

2333
01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:16.460
<v Speaker 5>ready to drop a punch down on bisping's </v>
<v Speaker 5>unconscious body.</v>

2334
01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:17.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2335
01:38:18.090 --> 01:38:20.820
<v Speaker 5>and then who else has the defendant then</v>
<v Speaker 5>defended it?</v>

2336
01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:22.590
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after he did that,</v>

2337
01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:23.680
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2338
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:26.690
<v Speaker 5>the faCt that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2339
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:28.650
<v Speaker 5>he's fighting gsp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the next fight.</v>

2340
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:29.663
<v Speaker 5>So he defended it against henderson and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then the next title defense is going to </v>

2341
01:38:33.251 --> 01:38:35.700
<v Speaker 5>be against gsp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't have one before henderson.</v>

2342
01:38:36.090 --> 01:38:36.381
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2343
01:38:36.381 --> 01:38:36.761
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2344
01:38:36.761 --> 01:38:39.180
<v Speaker 5>He won the title by beating luke </v>
<v Speaker 5>rockhold.</v>

2345
01:38:39.181 --> 01:38:39.600
<v Speaker 5>Luke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2346
01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.440
<v Speaker 5>He defended it against dan hendersOn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2347
01:38:41.450 --> 01:38:42.660
<v Speaker 5>I was going to fight gsp piece.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the,</v>

2348
01:38:42.661 --> 01:38:43.494
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thought is how is this guy getting </v>

2349
01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:48.550
<v Speaker 5>to fights that aren't right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>luke?</v>

2350
01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:52.680
<v Speaker 5>You mean when you look at number one </v>
<v Speaker 5>contender rockhold yoel romero,</v>

2351
01:38:52.681 --> 01:38:54.870
<v Speaker 5>who's the number one contender who was </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking terrifying.</v>

2352
01:38:54.930 --> 01:38:56.310
<v Speaker 5>He shoUld get the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2353
01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:57.790
<v Speaker 5>Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well should get the shot.</v>

2354
01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:58.890
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2355
01:38:58.891 --> 01:39:03.270
<v Speaker 5>If you look at it in terms of who's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>most viable contender,</v>

2356
01:39:03.271 --> 01:39:06.090
<v Speaker 5>who's the guy that you would think would</v>
<v Speaker 5>be the most threatening guy?</v>

2357
01:39:06.091 --> 01:39:08.370
<v Speaker 5>Who's the guy that might be the </v>
<v Speaker 5>uncrowned champion?</v>

2358
01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:12.180
<v Speaker 5>You got to go with yoel romero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It feels like ufc is.</v>

2359
01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:13.113
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they're trying to find their </v>

2360
01:39:14.791 --> 01:39:16.470
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their footing a little bit with no.</v>

2361
01:39:16.471 --> 01:39:18.510
<v Speaker 5>Rhonda and conner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2362
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:19.703
<v Speaker 5>so they're just going after that big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What can we sell a bunch of paper </v>

2363
01:39:22.291 --> 01:39:25.500
<v Speaker 5>reviews for gsps a big name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

2364
01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:26.140
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2365
01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:26.441
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>

2366
01:39:26.441 --> 01:39:27.090
<v Speaker 4>Please go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2367
01:39:27.090 --> 01:39:31.210
<v Speaker 4>I was just gonna ask to what's happening</v>
<v Speaker 4>with connor and that whole fight with</v>

2368
01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:33.903
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it has not been worked out yet so it's </v>

2369
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:36.423
<v Speaker 5>not definitive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's so much money involved that </v>

2370
01:39:37.831 --> 01:39:39.040
<v Speaker 5>they think they're going to make it </v>
<v Speaker 5>happen</v>

2371
01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:42.280
<v Speaker 4>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the ufc has got to come to an</v>

2372
01:39:42.281 --> 01:39:45.880
<v Speaker 4>agreement agreement or what did he get </v>
<v Speaker 4>in trouble with doc though?</v>

2373
01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:48.940
<v Speaker 4>Connor didn't convert for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for I don't know,</v>

2374
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.863
<v Speaker 4>not saying something and coming out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying something a while ago or get </v>

2375
01:39:53.051 --> 01:39:53.740
<v Speaker 4>fined or something.</v>

2376
01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:55.960
<v Speaker 5>He got fIned for the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the throwing the water bottle.</v>

2377
01:39:56.210 --> 01:39:57.560
<v Speaker 5>Monster energy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2378
01:39:57.561 --> 01:39:59.830
<v Speaker 5>They find them 150 grand and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>dropped it down.</v>

2379
01:39:59.950 --> 01:40:00.783
<v Speaker 5>I think they dropped it to like $35,000.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said he'd never fight in vegas again </v>

2380
01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.380
<v Speaker 5>after that and so and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2381
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:11.230
<v Speaker 5>you rely on your because there's going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to go to New York.</v>

2382
01:40:11.231 --> 01:40:14.170
<v Speaker 5>It's debacle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did the big factors.</v>

2383
01:40:14.171 --> 01:40:18.500
<v Speaker 5>Another factor is also that the ufc was </v>
<v Speaker 5>purchased by wme,</v>

2384
01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:20.133
<v Speaker 5>that's an entertainment comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>entertainment companies going to try to </v>

2385
01:40:22.691 --> 01:40:24.460
<v Speaker 5>put on the biggest show they could put </v>
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>

2386
01:40:24.730 --> 01:40:28.870
<v Speaker 5>and that's not necessarily like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>number one ranked contender fighting for</v>

2387
01:40:28.871 --> 01:40:32.530
<v Speaker 5>the title.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that it's an entertainment.</v>

2388
01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:34.750
<v Speaker 5>I understand it's business,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand,</v>

2389
01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:37.690
<v Speaker 5>but it is also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

2390
01:40:37.770 --> 01:40:38.603
<v Speaker 5>it's extremely important that you honor </v>
<v Speaker 5>the hierarchy of champion and top </v>

2391
01:40:42.701 --> 01:40:46.000
<v Speaker 5>challenge or I think that's critical </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you work your way up.</v>

2392
01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you pay your dues,</v>

2393
01:40:47.201 --> 01:40:48.460
<v Speaker 5>you work your way up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2394
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:52.330
<v Speaker 5>It's ranked on ability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2395
01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:53.313
<v Speaker 5>So they're trying to manufacture big </v>
<v Speaker 5>fights instead of letting big fights </v>

2396
01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:58.180
<v Speaker 5>killed themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Evolve.</v>

2397
01:40:58.410 --> 01:40:59.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bill,</v>

2398
01:40:59.230 --> 01:41:00.063
<v Speaker 5>big fights evolve when you let a guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>like yoel romero fight and he wins a </v>

2399
01:41:02.951 --> 01:41:04.600
<v Speaker 5>beats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chris weidman by knockout,</v>

2400
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:07.390
<v Speaker 5>and then if you fight michael bisping,</v>
<v Speaker 5>michael bisping,</v>

2401
01:41:07.690 --> 01:41:11.500
<v Speaker 5>michael bisping bto el ramiro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>michael bisping becomes a superstar,</v>

2402
01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:13.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's a tough fight.</v>

2403
01:41:13.330 --> 01:41:16.090
<v Speaker 5>It's a real tough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If yo el ramiro beats michael bisping,</v>

2404
01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:18.570
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he looks like a goddamn superhero.</v>

2405
01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:20.570
<v Speaker 5>so that's easy to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2406
01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:24.430
<v Speaker 5>you look at his highlight reel of </v>
<v Speaker 5>smashing people to the fucking moon.</v>

2407
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:25.623
<v Speaker 5>He's a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's one of the greatest wrestlers it's </v>

2408
01:41:27.341 --> 01:41:28.320
<v Speaker 5>ever competed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2409

2439
01:42:44.650 --> 01:42:46.810
<v Speaker 5>How recent was this fan?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A couple of months ago.</v>

2440
01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:48.900
<v Speaker 5>I was in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I saw down there.</v>

2441
01:42:49.090 --> 01:42:53.860
<v Speaker 5>He's just a freak and it cut the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 5>gash in the side of his head.</v>

2442
01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:56.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See if you get a clear video of it.</v>

2443
01:42:56.860 --> 01:43:01.030
<v Speaker 5>Superman fly from like another angle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's just a.</v>

2444
01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a freak of nature and science.</v>

2445
01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:04.773
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

2446
01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:06.670
<v Speaker 5>that's cape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's capable of.</v>

2447
01:43:06.671 --> 01:43:11.671
<v Speaker 5>That was the second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like the amount of force behind that</v>

2448
01:43:11.711 --> 01:43:14.890
<v Speaker 5>is just flying through the air and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's like so irregular to.</v>

2449
01:43:14.891 --> 01:43:19.030
<v Speaker 5>It's kinda like the way like chuck with </v>
<v Speaker 5>dell used to hit like real irregular,</v>

2450
01:43:19.090 --> 01:43:23.980
<v Speaker 5>like a flying knee to of well he's just </v>
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>

2451
01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:25.083
<v Speaker 5>He's so explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So his ability to close the distance is </v>

2452
01:43:28.091 --> 01:43:28.924
<v Speaker 5>stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes people aren't prepared for it </v>

2453
01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:34.090
<v Speaker 5>because he's such an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in that fight it didn't feel like he</v>

2454
01:43:34.091 --> 01:43:36.370
<v Speaker 5>had been doing much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

2455
01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.470
<v Speaker 5>I feel like he was just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>god,</v>

2456
01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:41.840
<v Speaker 5>what is he going to like get off?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a close fight for sure.</v>

2457
01:43:41.841 --> 01:43:44.530
<v Speaker 5>And then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just out of nowhere.</v>

2458
01:43:44.770 --> 01:43:46.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So whether or not,</v>

2459
01:43:46.931 --> 01:43:47.764
<v Speaker 5>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether or not michael bisping can beat </v>

2460
01:43:49.811 --> 01:43:50.710
<v Speaker 5>him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like who knows?</v>

2461
01:43:50.711 --> 01:43:52.970
<v Speaker 5>But he's got to give them a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2462
01:43:52.971 --> 01:43:55.250
<v Speaker 5>I know he does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's going to give you all a chance.</v>

2463
01:43:55.251 --> 01:43:56.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it seems,</v>

2464
01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:59.420
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't seem that life isn't fair.</v>

2465
01:43:59.421 --> 01:44:02.570
<v Speaker 5>Who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't seem fair that it's gsp.</v>

2466
01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:03.500
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing is,</v>

2467
01:44:03.501 --> 01:44:06.320
<v Speaker 5>is it a sport or is it entertainment?</v>

2468
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:09.540
<v Speaker 5>I mean you just trying to put on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>spectacle or is it a sport?</v>

2469
01:44:09.790 --> 01:44:11.870
<v Speaker 5>It's a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're going to have the world series</v>

2470
01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:16.580
<v Speaker 5>people play this guy to play that guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then it gets to the world series.</v>

2471
01:44:16.581 --> 01:44:18.340
<v Speaker 5>And here's the world series folks,</v>

2473
01:44:21.981 --> 01:44:22.814
<v Speaker 5>the hierarchy and it's still huge now if</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just to show you the three of them </v>

2474
01:44:26.841 --> 01:44:28.160

<v Speaker 5>I was saying all three.</v>

2476
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.360
<v Speaker 5>I was saying that they should have </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're dealing with a guy in gsp</v>

2477
01:44:35.361 --> 01:44:36.930
<v Speaker 5>has been out for a long time.</v>

2505
01:45:43.151 --> 01:45:44.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people don't know that it's,</v>

2506
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:46.570
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty crazy heat.</v>

2507
01:45:46.571 --> 01:45:47.370
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to,</v>

2508
01:45:47.370 --> 01:45:49.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to butcher the details,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

2509
01:45:49.570 --> 01:45:50.051
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2510
01:45:50.051 --> 01:45:50.910
<v Speaker 4>from growing up.</v>

2511
01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:54.580
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2512
01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:55.660
<v Speaker 5>but what happened</v>

2513
01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:56.493
<v Speaker 4>was he was in the army and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was right around the time the korean </v>

2514
01:45:59.801 --> 01:46:02.650
<v Speaker 4>war was starting and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were flying,</v>

2515
01:46:02.651 --> 01:46:03.484
<v Speaker 4>they were doing a routine flight or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something and they had to crash land in </v>

2516
01:46:07.211 --> 01:46:12.211
<v Speaker 4>the ocean and it was getting night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I believed,</v>

2517
01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:17.000
<v Speaker 4>I believed the pilot died and I could be</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong on that.</v>

2518
01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:20.710
<v Speaker 4>The pilot died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but his other guy he was with survived.</v>

2519
01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:25.740
<v Speaker 4>So him and him and this other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were swimming to shore and they got</v>

2520
01:46:26.261 --> 01:46:27.094
<v Speaker 4>split up because it was getting dark at </v>
<v Speaker 4>night and so then now they're swimming </v>

2521
01:46:29.921 --> 01:46:32.740
<v Speaker 4>alone and anyone who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know san francisco is.</v>

2523
01:46:36.710 --> 01:46:37.870
<v Speaker 5>Jaws.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He's the guy that make make a scene.</v>

2640
01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:18.460
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well he's just funny man.</v>

2641
01:51:18.461 --> 01:51:19.660
<v Speaker 5>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

2642
01:51:19.690 --> 01:51:22.420
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not funny that way the way he is.</v>

2643
01:51:22.421 --> 01:51:25.150
<v Speaker 5>He's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a natural showman wound.</v>

2644
01:51:25.151 --> 01:51:26.050
<v Speaker 5>Silly person.</v>

2645
01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:30.100
<v Speaker 5>Always silly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the first time I took him to Montana</v>

2646
01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:32.800
<v Speaker 5>we went hunting with rinella.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it was just,</v>

2647
01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:37.000
<v Speaker 5>it was six days of gut busting howling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Laughter does.</v>

2648
01:51:37.010 --> 01:51:39.880
<v Speaker 5>Does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Steve seems more like dry though.</v>

2649
01:51:40.210 --> 01:51:40.880
<v Speaker 5>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does.</v>

2650
01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:43.720
<v Speaker 5>He was funny guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>HE's got a couple of pops in them,</v>

2651
01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:47.890
<v Speaker 5>funny dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but collin had this character called the</v>

2652
01:51:47.891 --> 01:51:51.940
<v Speaker 5>ravine comer and he couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They wouldn't put it anywhere.</v>

2653
01:51:51.941 --> 01:51:54.160
<v Speaker 5>They wouldn't release the footage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they filmed it.</v>

2654
01:51:54.490 --> 01:51:55.323
<v Speaker 5>It was him who was doing this character </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a guy who finds every time he sees </v>

2655
01:51:57.580 --> 01:51:58.413
<v Speaker 5>ravine ravinia has to come,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he runs towards it counts like </v>

2656
01:52:02.591 --> 01:52:03.424
<v Speaker 5>pulling his pants down and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>screaming that he's shooting loads into </v>

2657
01:52:06.971 --> 01:52:07.990
<v Speaker 5>this ravine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2658
01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:11.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing it any justice because </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like way over the top.</v>

2659
01:52:11.801 --> 01:52:13.720
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh fuck.</v>

2660
01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:18.820
<v Speaker 5>Like he would just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever you'd see like sort of a valley</v>

2661
01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:21.310
<v Speaker 5>who would have to pretend he was jerking</v>
<v Speaker 5>off into it.</v>

2662
01:52:23.290 --> 01:52:25.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems so ridiculous,</v>

2663
01:52:25.751 --> 01:52:26.470
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

2664
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:27.303
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think everybody's done that before </v>

2665
01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:31.180
<v Speaker 5>you're talking into a ravine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2666
01:52:31.181 --> 01:52:32.740
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you're little,</v>

2667
01:52:33.230 --> 01:52:35.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get up at 5:30 in the morning,</v>

2668
01:52:35.351 --> 01:52:36.820
<v Speaker 5>it's dark out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're freezing.</v>

2669
01:52:36.821 --> 01:52:38.920
<v Speaker 5>He's the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's just mAking everybody laugh.</v>

2670
01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:39.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what he,</v>

2671
01:52:40.030 --> 01:52:41.920
<v Speaker 5>that's what he mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was something weird about that,</v>

2672
01:52:41.921 --> 01:52:42.754
<v Speaker 5>like in the woods and you're waking up </v>
<v Speaker 5>super early or going surfing super </v>

2673
01:52:45.411 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 5>early,</v>

2674
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.020
<v Speaker 4>you're sort of delirious and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>

2675
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:49.303
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are we putting ourselves through </v>

2676
01:52:50.601 --> 01:52:51.860
<v Speaker 4>this shit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you know,</v>

2677
01:52:51.861 --> 01:52:52.694
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you obviously do your activity or </v>

2678
01:52:53.871 --> 01:52:55.730
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is and you're happy you did </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2679
01:52:55.731 --> 01:52:57.120
<v Speaker 4>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2680
01:52:57.310 --> 01:52:58.880
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird delirium.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our,</v>

2681
01:52:59.040 --> 01:52:59.873
<v Speaker 5>there's also some weird thoughts that go</v>
<v Speaker 5>through your mind when you're sleep </v>

2682
01:53:02.161 --> 01:53:04.820
<v Speaker 5>deprived that don't ordinarily go </v>
<v Speaker 5>through your mind.</v>

2683
01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:07.380
<v Speaker 5>So one of the reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like some writers on purpose,</v>

2684
01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:10.200
<v Speaker 5>we'll wait until like really late at </v>
<v Speaker 5>night until they write.</v>

2685
01:53:10.201 --> 01:53:12.210
<v Speaker 5>Like the writers that wrote for news </v>
<v Speaker 5>radio,</v>

2686
01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:13.053
<v Speaker 5>those sitcoms to be on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would wait until like two or three </v>

2687
01:53:15.361 --> 01:53:16.740
<v Speaker 5>in the morning before they started </v>
<v Speaker 5>writing.</v>

2688
01:53:17.250 --> 01:53:20.040
<v Speaker 5>They would just stay up and get silly </v>
<v Speaker 5>and joke around those who simply</v>

2689
01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:21.133
<v Speaker 4>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can be someone that's usually when I </v>

2690
01:53:23.601 --> 01:53:26.300
<v Speaker 4>make a post that I wake up in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>morning anD read and be like,</v>

2691
01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:27.800
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did I say that?</v>

2692
01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:29.690
<v Speaker 4>I did that the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in New York.</v>

2693
01:53:29.691 --> 01:53:32.390
<v Speaker 4>I was sat at a bar and we were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were,</v>

2694
01:53:32.391 --> 01:53:33.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were all celebrating sort of,</v>

2695
01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:35.153
<v Speaker 4>we were fast and furious stuff and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wake up in the morning and there's me </v>

2696
01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:39.433
<v Speaker 4>screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2697
01:53:39.450 --> 01:53:44.450
<v Speaker 4>singing tina turner at the top of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>lungs as long what's love got to do it.</v>

2698
01:53:44.481 --> 01:53:46.090
<v Speaker 4>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.</v>

2699
01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:49.430

<v Speaker 4>It's a story.</v>

2700
01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:52.930
<v Speaker 4>It was so not part of any of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2701
01:53:53.090 --> 01:53:54.430
<v Speaker 4>it was just.</v>

2707
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:04.183
<v Speaker 4>we don't do a lot of the heavy lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The heavy lifting is done by a </v>

2708
01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:09.200
<v Speaker 4>professional stunt guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

2709
01:54:09.530 --> 01:54:11.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a big liability first off,</v>

2710
01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:14.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in those stents or I mean they do an</v>

2711
01:54:14.361 --> 01:54:17.180
<v Speaker 4>incredible job of keeping everything in </v>
<v Speaker 4>camera,</v>

2712
01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:18.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or at least a lot of it,</v>

2715
01:54:21.831 --> 01:54:25.370
<v Speaker 4>camera and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they do a really good job of,</v>

2716
01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:29.150
<v Speaker 4>of utilizing the stunt drivers talents </v>
<v Speaker 4>and keeping a lot of stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 4>a gun and blank ammunition,</v>

2766
01:56:38.941 --> 01:56:41.010
<v Speaker 4>you're still not supposed to point at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the actor,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2773
01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:51.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean like even in a scene where you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting.</v>

2774
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:53.351
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2775
01:56:53.351 --> 01:56:56.370
<v Speaker 4>You want to sort of offset it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if it's close.</v>

2776
01:56:56.371 --> 01:56:59.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean they do testing and stuff first </v>
<v Speaker 4>to see and they'll tell you,</v>

2777
01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:00.990
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't pass this line.</v>

2778
01:57:01.290 --> 01:57:02.123
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're walking up and you're gonna </v>

2779
01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:05.310
<v Speaker 4>pull a gun on somebody that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2780
01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:08.250
<v Speaker 4>we don't want you to go past this line </v>
<v Speaker 4>or so.</v>

2781
01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:09.750
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then obviously,</v>

2782
01:57:09.751 --> 01:57:10.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2783
01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:11.393
<v Speaker 4>can you not aim it directly their head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll find like a good point for you </v>

2784
01:57:14.191 --> 01:57:17.160
<v Speaker 4>to aim and that that's with the camera a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit.</v>

2785
01:57:17.250 --> 01:57:18.083
<v Speaker 4>I had heard that that happened after </v>
<v Speaker 4>brendan league got killed and movie the </v>

2786
01:57:20.161 --> 01:57:21.290
<v Speaker 4>crow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2787
01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:24.160
<v Speaker 4>And that was a bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It had real ammo in there,</v>

2788
01:57:24.161 --> 01:57:24.950
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2789
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:29.510
<v Speaker 4>there was like some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got it.</v>

2790
01:57:29.570 --> 01:57:32.130
<v Speaker 4>What happens is sometimes what happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>is sometimes you know,</v>

2791
01:57:32.131 --> 01:57:33.720
<v Speaker 4>and even in these airbags,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same,</v>

2792
01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:34.613
<v Speaker 4>same sort of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had all these recall on these </v>

2793
01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:39.240
<v Speaker 4>airbags is what happens is these blanks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2794
01:57:39.241 --> 01:57:40.074
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll bunch up together over time if </v>

2795
01:57:42.381 --> 01:57:44.070
<v Speaker 4>it's an old blank that gunpowder.</v>

2796
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:46.370
<v Speaker 4>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can harden.</v>

2797
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:47.303
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it can shoot like a projection </v>

2798
01:57:49.410 --> 01:57:52.320
<v Speaker 4>of a couple of shotgun pellets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2799
01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:53.213
<v Speaker 4>And it just penetrated at that spot and </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed them crazy as a 44 magnum I </v>

2800
01:57:57.421 --> 01:58:00.240
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was a ton of power behind it.</v>

2801
01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:02.310
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2802
01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:03.933
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2803
01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:07.260
<v Speaker 4>So now they just pointed to the side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would have like fight scenes.</v>

2804
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:09.223
<v Speaker 4>Do you have to do fight scenes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like especially you have a martial arts </v>

2805
01:58:12.241 --> 01:58:14.040
<v Speaker 4>background,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she have you do scenes.</v>

2806
01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:16.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't do the,</v>

2807
01:58:16.381 --> 01:58:18.900
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't a terrible amount of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

2808
01:58:18.901 --> 01:58:20.820
<v Speaker 4>Slammed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>slammed against the wall.</v>

2809
01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:24.210
<v Speaker 4>I get slapped around a little bit in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this one,</v>

2810
01:58:24.690 --> 01:58:25.860
<v Speaker 4>but to assure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2811
01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:27.660
<v Speaker 4>in other films,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love doing that stuff.</v>

2812
01:58:27.661 --> 01:58:29.220
<v Speaker 4>That's the fun stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially,</v>

2813
01:58:29.230 --> 01:58:30.063
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because because you get to hang with </v>

2814
01:58:30.630 --> 01:58:31.463
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2815
01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:33.080
<v Speaker 4>some of the coolest guys on sets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the,</v>

2816
01:58:33.090 --> 01:58:34.450
<v Speaker 4>all the stunt guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2817
01:58:34.670 --> 01:58:36.050
<v Speaker 4>they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2818
01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:37.560
<v Speaker 4>likeminded people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

2819
01:58:37.710 --> 01:58:39.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>martial art background,</v>

2820
01:58:39.031 --> 01:58:40.350
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2821
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:43.990
<v Speaker 4>and so you're choreographing all day </v>
<v Speaker 4>working that out and then you get on set</v>

2822
01:58:43.991 --> 01:58:45.310
<v Speaker 4>and you're doing it or you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2823
01:58:45.340 --> 01:58:46.173
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing it with them because they </v>

2824
01:58:46.901 --> 01:58:48.210
<v Speaker 4>might be playing the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2825
01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:51.490
<v Speaker 4>villa number seven or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then you're,</v>

2826
01:58:51.491 --> 01:58:53.410
<v Speaker 4>you've already sort of got a shorthand </v>
<v Speaker 4>with them and your,</v>

2827
01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:55.060
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the fun stuff.</v>

2828
01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:55.953
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's way better than dealing with a </v>

2829
01:58:57.041 --> 01:58:59.230
<v Speaker 4>difficult actor or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever do that?</v>

2830
01:59:00.610 --> 01:59:02.260
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the worst.</v>

2831
01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:03.110
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

2832
01:59:03.110 --> 01:59:07.030
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to get something else.</v>

2833
01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:11.100
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>but that might just be lips and louis </v>

2839
01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:25.830
<v Speaker 4>slips yet in the scene.</v>

<v Speaker 4>holds them against the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And was that real?</v>

<v Speaker 4>He's not done getting jacked.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's just a.</v>

2874
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:49.383
<v Speaker 4>When you see his schedule and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>workload and then there's always some </v>

2875

<v Speaker 4>Moving.</v>

2879
02:01:02.710 --> 02:01:05.860
<v Speaker 4>Finishing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That movement is like how I tell you the</v>

2880
02:01:05.861 --> 02:01:07.480
<v Speaker 4>travel is what kills me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you probably,</v>

2881
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:10.030
<v Speaker 4>you've been in show business for all </v>
<v Speaker 4>longer than all of us,</v>

2882
02:01:10.031 --> 02:01:10.864
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2883
02:01:10.930 --> 02:01:12.900
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the travel is what kills you.</v>

2884
02:01:12.970 --> 02:01:15.580
<v Speaker 4>WRite these long flights and then jet </v>
<v Speaker 4>lag and then trying to,</v>

2885
02:01:15.590 --> 02:01:18.550
<v Speaker 4>you got to go hit the gym and I did a </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast yesterday.</v>

2886
02:01:18.551 --> 02:01:20.140
<v Speaker 4>MY brain just wouldn't fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2887
02:01:20.170 --> 02:01:21.003
<v Speaker 4>It takes to me like a day or two who had</v>
<v Speaker 4>just flown in from buffalo and it just </v>

2888
02:01:24.941 --> 02:01:28.060
<v Speaker 4>takes a day or two like for your brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>to like rethink.</v>

2889
02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:31.330
<v Speaker 4>Like today I feel normal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yesterday I just was like foggy with</v>

2890
02:01:31.331 --> 02:01:32.164
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't tried it but I keep hearing </v>

2891
02:01:33.521 --> 02:01:34.354
<v Speaker 4>about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're supposed to do with the </v>

2892
02:01:36.731 --> 02:01:37.564
<v Speaker 4>light for the jet lag because like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>simulation of light wherever you're at </v>

2893
02:01:41.631 --> 02:01:42.810
<v Speaker 4>and then they have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2894
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:46.820
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to put on the eye thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when it's supposed to get dark,</v>

2895
02:01:46.821 --> 02:01:48.740
<v Speaker 4>like say you're flying into the light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're flying,</v>

2896
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:49.603
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going away those covers and stimulate </v>

2897
02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:54.260
<v Speaker 4>wherever you want with whoever you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to end up.</v>

2898
02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:56.480
<v Speaker 4>And that really supposed to help with </v>
<v Speaker 4>jet lag.</v>

2899
02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:57.433
<v Speaker 5>I was reading a podcast about Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people that hunt in Alaska and then </v>

2900
02:02:00.171 --> 02:02:04.190
<v Speaker 5>when you go up there in the summer and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you get two hours of a podcast,</v>

2901
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:07.130
<v Speaker 5>did I say reading what the fuck is wrong</v>
<v Speaker 5>with me?</v>

2902
02:02:07.131 --> 02:02:10.100
<v Speaker 5>Why do I keep saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the second time on this podcast.</v>

2903
02:02:10.101 --> 02:02:10.934
<v Speaker 5>I've never said it before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I'm still not really recovered </v>

2904
02:02:12.531 --> 02:02:14.060
<v Speaker 5>from buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in denial.</v>

2905
02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:15.613
<v Speaker 5>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was listening to a podcast where they </v>

2906
02:02:17.331 --> 02:02:18.164
<v Speaker 5>were talking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy was talking about how usually </v>

2907
02:02:19.911 --> 02:02:20.744
<v Speaker 5>sleeps like a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he went up to Alaska and because </v>

2908
02:02:22.941 --> 02:02:23.774
<v Speaker 5>it's it's only dark for two hours a </v>
<v Speaker 5>night in the summer where they were at </v>

2909
02:02:26.961 --> 02:02:27.794
<v Speaker 5>and I think they were in the brooks </v>
<v Speaker 5>range and he was saying that like after </v>

2910
02:02:30.651 --> 02:02:34.030
<v Speaker 5>like six or seven days started getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>delusional and just delirious.</v>

2911
02:02:34.050 --> 02:02:35.240
<v Speaker 5>You know what's going on?</v>

2912
02:02:35.690 --> 02:02:38.850
<v Speaker 4>That circadian rhythm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that just the Light?</v>

2913
02:02:38.851 --> 02:02:39.684
<v Speaker 4>Because say the light affects the optic </v>
<v Speaker 4>nerves where you're supposed to produce </v>

2914
02:02:42.931 --> 02:02:43.630
<v Speaker 4>melatonin.</v>

2915
02:02:43.630 --> 02:02:44.463
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2916
02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:46.820
<v Speaker 5>and this guy was saying that the way to </v>
<v Speaker 5>mitigate that,</v>

2917
02:02:46.821 --> 02:02:47.654
<v Speaker 5>that he didn't know at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was told by someone is to wear a </v>

2918
02:02:50.271 --> 02:02:53.210
<v Speaker 5>mask that those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those sleeping mask you see in movies,</v>

2919
02:02:53.670 --> 02:02:57.500
<v Speaker 5>you always look so silly and movies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but those things are actually effective.</v>

2920
02:02:57.600 --> 02:02:58.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2921
02:02:58.950 --> 02:03:02.150
<v Speaker 5>I been sloppy about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a fucking Alaska though.</v>

2922
02:03:02.151 --> 02:03:04.190
<v Speaker 5>You need it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been in the summer.</v>

2923
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.760
<v Speaker 5>El.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2924
02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:05.540
<v Speaker 5>it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2925
02:03:05.540 --> 02:03:07.160
<v Speaker 5>Many tImes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Weird though.</v>

2926
02:03:07.390 --> 02:03:08.223
<v Speaker 4>We would have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would bear hunt until I used to go </v>

2927
02:03:11.050 --> 02:03:14.060
<v Speaker 4>with roy almost every year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd bear hunt until.</v>

2928
02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:17.230

2929
02:03:18.220 --> 02:03:19.690

2932
02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:27.850
<v Speaker 4>Then we'd go fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we'd start baiting again.</v>

2933
02:03:27.851 --> 02:03:30.160
<v Speaker 4>Then we'd hung out that night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we'd do the same thing.</v>

2934
02:03:30.250 --> 02:03:33.850
<v Speaker 4>No sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which part of Alaska we were.</v>

2935

<v Speaker 5>But your signature on something,</v>

2993
02:05:58.411 --> 02:06:00.120
<v Speaker 5>I guess you want to change the color of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the car.</v>

2994
02:06:00.121 --> 02:06:01.890
<v Speaker 5>I bought a new car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cost me $4,000,000,000.</v>

2997
02:06:07.190 --> 02:06:10.020
<v Speaker 5>efficient ip and married them?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He going to commentate the.</v>

2998
02:06:10.021 --> 02:06:12.030
<v Speaker 5>A tough fight if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

2999
02:06:12.040 --> 02:06:12.873
<v Speaker 5>if I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will you be the front runner to be one </v>

3000
02:06:14.701 --> 02:06:18.690
<v Speaker 5>of the commentators that they do the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mcgregor mayweather fight?</v>

3001
02:06:19.470 --> 02:06:21.920
<v Speaker 5>Most likely no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's a boxing match.</v>

3002
02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:23.220
<v Speaker 5>Most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just,</v>

3003
02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:27.840
<v Speaker 5>I'll be here watching it on the screen </v>
<v Speaker 5>for it though,</v>

3004
02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:29.640
<v Speaker 5>if it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3005
02:06:30.270 --> 02:06:32.520
<v Speaker 5>I just don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's that it's a.</v>

3006
02:06:32.600 --> 02:06:35.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a boxing commentator.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know a lot about boxing,</v>

3007
02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:36.553
<v Speaker 5>followed boxing since I was a kid and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've commentated on kickboxing baths </v>

3008
02:06:40.261 --> 02:06:41.094
<v Speaker 5>before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've never commented on a boxing </v>

3009
02:06:42.361 --> 02:06:43.830
<v Speaker 5>fight before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be kind of cool though.</v>

3010
02:06:43.831 --> 02:06:44.664
<v Speaker 5>They had a couple of two guys in boxing </v>
<v Speaker 5>world in you because maybe you were </v>

3011
02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:51.270
<v Speaker 5>there to collect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They always have jim lampley.</v>

3012
02:06:51.380 --> 02:06:52.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3013
02:06:52.110 --> 02:06:55.580
<v Speaker 5>Is that who they always have in max </v>
<v Speaker 5>kellerman who I really love max.</v>

3014
02:06:55.650 --> 02:06:56.930
<v Speaker 5>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3015

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a big dude and a different perspective </v>

3018
02:07:05.131 --> 02:07:08.220
<v Speaker 5>just because with mcgregor coming out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ufc,</v>

3019
02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:10.250
<v Speaker 5>paulie malignaggi,</v>

<v Speaker 5>champion boxer that be maybe most likely</v>
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>

3022
02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.890
<v Speaker 5>Most likely.</v>

<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>

3067
02:08:51.831 --> 02:08:55.750
<v Speaker 5>It took forever to get to the fight.</v>

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3097
02:09:58.430 --> 02:09:59.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a pilot.</v>

3098
02:09:59.571 --> 02:10:00.880

<v Speaker 4>And so I'd like to,</v>

3101
02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:04.760
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to fly that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of,</v>

3102
02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for pilots it's kind of like,</v>

3103
02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:07.620
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a bucket list place at.</v>

3104
02:10:09.450 --> 02:10:10.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other places.</v>

3105
02:10:10.990 --> 02:10:14.240
<v Speaker 4>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a license in America and you</v>

3106
02:10:14.241 --> 02:10:17.210
<v Speaker 4>want to fly in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously you can't fly a helicopter all</v>

3107
02:10:17.211 --> 02:10:20.330
<v Speaker 4>the way to Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No flY.</v>

3108
02:10:20.331 --> 02:10:22.230
<v Speaker 4>Like what's the longest distance?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3109
02:10:22.270 --> 02:10:22.610
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

3110
02:10:22.610 --> 02:10:23.443
<v Speaker 4>it really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really just depends on what </v>

3111
02:10:24.261 --> 02:10:26.840
<v Speaker 4>helicopter you're talking about and how </v>
<v Speaker 4>many people you're,</v>

3112
02:10:26.990 --> 02:10:28.880
<v Speaker 4>you're west.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of people's,</v>

3113
02:10:29.150 --> 02:10:31.580
<v Speaker 4>the furthest travel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the helicopters ever gone.</v>

3114
02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:35.060
<v Speaker 4>Well that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a black hawk I would imagine.</v>

3115
02:10:35.330 --> 02:10:38.330
<v Speaker 4>TheY have a dual engines and they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

3116
02:10:38.970 --> 02:10:41.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>$11,000,000 or $20,000,000 helicopter,</v>

3117
02:10:41.781 --> 02:10:43.310
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got,</v>

3118
02:10:43.370 --> 02:10:45.860
<v Speaker 4>you kNow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a massive fuel tanks that,</v>

3119
02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:48.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a civilian helicopter can't go.</v>

3120
02:10:48.930 --> 02:10:50.120
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I wouldn't know the answer,</v>

3121
02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:54.070
<v Speaker 4>but I know jamie like a black blackout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to guess.</v>

3122
02:10:54.090 --> 02:10:55.930
<v Speaker 4>Let's guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how far do you think?</v>

3123
02:10:56.090 --> 02:11:00.510
<v Speaker 4>I bet they can fly for 12 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No way.</v>

3124
02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:02.460
<v Speaker 4>That's a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

3125
02:11:02.690 --> 02:11:07.690
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm hearing you say I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>say 300 miles.</v>

3126
02:11:08.150 --> 02:11:09.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

3127
02:11:09.230 --> 02:11:12.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say that if someone's </v>
<v Speaker 4>chasing complete guests,</v>

3128
02:11:12.621 --> 02:11:13.790
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

3129
02:11:13.850 --> 02:11:16.550
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would kind of go on cameron syme.</v>

3130
02:11:16.551 --> 02:11:20.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying across the ocean three times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so not even close.</v>

3131
02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:23.420
<v Speaker 4>If you're thinking 12 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how fast do they go?</v>

3132
02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:24.890
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it depends.</v>

3133
02:11:24.891 --> 02:11:26.810
<v Speaker 4>If you're on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're in a piston helicopter,</v>

3134
02:11:27.060 --> 02:11:28.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or if you're in a turban helicopter,</v>

3135
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:29.700
<v Speaker 4>like a black hawk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3136
02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:31.060
<v Speaker 4>what's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3137
02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:34.370
<v Speaker 4>piston helicopter is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is like a piston engine,</v>

3138
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:36.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a car engine.</v>

3139
02:11:36.530 --> 02:11:37.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it uses,</v>

3140
02:11:37.710 --> 02:11:38.660
<v Speaker 4>uses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3141
02:11:38.661 --> 02:11:39.494
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3142
02:11:39.530 --> 02:11:41.900
<v Speaker 4>your blades this in the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fashion,</v>

3143
02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:47.320
<v Speaker 4>but a fast speed on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on like a 44,</v>

3144
02:11:48.770 --> 02:11:49.603
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you like 130 knots I think as your v </v>

3145
02:11:52.101 --> 02:11:57.101
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is your miles without landing.</v>

3146
02:11:57.380 --> 02:11:58.213
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand 200.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is where we get your </v>

3147
02:12:03.621 --> 02:12:06.380
<v Speaker 4>information from a small helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an md.</v>

3148
02:12:06.381 --> 02:12:07.410
<v Speaker 4>500.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not it.</v>

3149
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:09.190
<v Speaker 4>That's the black hawk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a,</v>

3150
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:13.630
<v Speaker 4>that's not black rock concert right </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

3151
02:12:13.650 --> 02:12:15.000
<v Speaker 4>What do You mean it's not right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on the wiki.</v>

3152
02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:17.900
<v Speaker 4>We already diScussed this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyone can edit this.</v>

3153
02:12:17.901 --> 02:12:20.310
<v Speaker 4>Of course it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was wrongly was correct.</v>

3154
02:12:20.311 --> 02:12:23.050
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so 400 miles on it or no?</v>

3155
02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:26.150
<v Speaker 4>Two hundred 50 miles per hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That lender goes,</v>

3156
02:12:26.151 --> 02:12:27.440
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a,</v>

3157
02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:32.740
<v Speaker 4>that's a record that's find out what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>See if you can google a blackhawk google</v>

3158
02:12:35.331 --> 02:12:38.300
<v Speaker 4>black hawk helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would you google?</v>

3159
02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:39.760
<v Speaker 4>Long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long distance.</v>

3160
02:12:39.870 --> 02:12:42.650
<v Speaker 4>Long distance distance capability </v>
<v Speaker 4>capability or something?</v>

3161
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:45.650
<v Speaker 4>Distance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>

3162
02:12:46.820 --> 02:12:48.080
<v Speaker 4>Two hundred 76 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3163
02:12:48.081 --> 02:12:49.370
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3164
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:51.050
<v Speaker 4>nautical miles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>300.</v>

3165
02:12:51.370 --> 02:12:52.203
<v Speaker 4>Three hundred nautical mile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred and 51 miles shorter than </v>

3166
02:12:54.561 --> 02:12:56.630
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Similar rotated aircrafts.</v>

3167
02:12:56.631 --> 02:13:00.530
<v Speaker 4>Maximum altitude is 6,000 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tufts v 1:50.</v>

3168
02:13:00.531 --> 02:13:03.350
<v Speaker 4>Once they see they're pretty fast </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know a turban.</v>

3169
02:13:03.351 --> 02:13:06.170
<v Speaker 4>Helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you can get some civilian ones.</v>

3170
02:13:06.171 --> 02:13:07.660
<v Speaker 4>The md 500.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that entail?</v>

3171
02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:09.310
<v Speaker 4>When you say knots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>

3172
02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:11.480
<v Speaker 4>Like mile per hour?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wind.</v>

3173
02:13:11.481 --> 02:13:16.481
<v Speaker 4>Fifty one miles per hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have to check.</v>

3174
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:20.690
<v Speaker 4>Why do they say nautical miles?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two miles or longer than than.</v>

3175
02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:21.583
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One point one we'll put one foot or one </v>

3176
02:13:25.050 --> 02:13:25.970
<v Speaker 4>five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3177
02:13:25.971 --> 02:13:26.804
<v Speaker 4>So it's one point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One mile per hour for every one mile an </v>

3178
02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:30.380
<v Speaker 4>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not to a mile.</v>

3179
02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 4>So it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's more than 100.</v>

3180
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:33.900
<v Speaker 5>Fifty miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>300 or.</v>

3181
02:13:33.901 --> 02:13:34.980
<v Speaker 5>Wait?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3182
02:13:34.981 --> 02:13:37.950
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was 207 instead of 150 </v>
<v Speaker 5>knots,</v>

3183
02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:39.400
<v Speaker 5>didn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A hundred 50 knots.</v>

3184
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:41.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's one point.</v>

3185
02:13:41.971 --> 02:13:42.870
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two each.</v>

3186
02:13:42.871 --> 02:13:45.690
<v Speaker 5>So 176.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's that one?</v>

3187
02:13:45.691 --> 02:13:48.020
<v Speaker 5>51 nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Top speed comes at 1:50.</v>

3188
02:13:48.030 --> 02:13:51.630
<v Speaker 5>One knots at 60.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One nautical mile distance.</v>

3189
02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:54.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I typed in distance and that's the so it</v>

3190
02:13:54.061 --> 02:13:55.170
<v Speaker 5>can fly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3191
02:13:55.171 --> 02:13:56.790
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So would you.</v>

3192
02:13:56.950 --> 02:13:59.600
<v Speaker 5>Was this last one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Knots or miles you just googled.</v>

3193
02:13:59.610 --> 02:14:04.610
<v Speaker 5>The second thing is just how would not </v>
<v Speaker 5>miles but not nautical miles per hour.</v>

3194
02:14:08.730 --> 02:14:10.830
<v Speaker 5>that's whether or not his medical mile </v>
<v Speaker 5>per hour.</v>

3195
02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:12.330
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3196
02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:17.480
<v Speaker 5>So the speed of knots is the same as </v>
<v Speaker 5>nautical miles.</v>

3197
02:14:18.270 --> 02:14:19.570
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3198
02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:20.640
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how interesting.</v>

3199
02:14:20.770 --> 02:14:22.380
<v Speaker 5>So I wonder why that was just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was miles.</v>

3200
02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:24.540
<v Speaker 5>Why fucking confused the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody?</v>

3201
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:26.183
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the same thing with the standard </v>

3202
02:14:27.571 --> 02:14:28.590
<v Speaker 5>metrics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you know that?</v>

3203
02:14:28.591 --> 02:14:29.424
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not in the nautical mile with the same </v>

3204
02:14:30.211 --> 02:14:32.420
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just learned that I didn't know,</v>

3205
02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:33.593
<v Speaker 5>but it's just like adam putting up </v>
<v Speaker 5>celsius for temperature that the green </v>

3206
02:14:37.090 --> 02:14:38.700
<v Speaker 5>tree Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

3207
02:14:38.701 --> 02:14:41.270
<v Speaker 5>I just say nobody knows what celsius is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What we should.</v>

3208
02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:43.290
<v Speaker 5>He put up american dollars to just for </v>
<v Speaker 5>instagram.</v>

3209
02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:46.500
<v Speaker 5>What do you do with that stupid green </v>
<v Speaker 5>money?</v>

3210
02:14:47.050 --> 02:14:49.290

<v Speaker 5>recognize 150 people or something like </v>

3303
02:18:46.691 --> 02:18:49.600
<v Speaker 5>that where you can have relationships.</v>

02:18:52.181 --> 02:18:52.901
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

3306
02:18:52.901 --> 02:18:54.730
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

02:18:55.920 --> 02:18:59.380
<v Speaker 5>1:50,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is great.</v>

3308

<v Speaker 5>dunbar's number.</v>

3310
02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:07.090
<v Speaker 5>You keep 150 people in your head that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>have friendships with.</v>

3311
02:19:07.180 --> 02:19:08.013
<v Speaker 5>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the idea is that our brain was </v>

3312
02:19:10.361 --> 02:19:14.890
<v Speaker 5>designed to absorb the names and faces </v>
<v Speaker 5>of people that are in our tribe and then</v>

3313
02:19:14.891 --> 02:19:17.590
<v Speaker 5>when tribes get over 150 people there </v>
<v Speaker 5>essentially unmanageable.</v>

3314
02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:19.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe it.</v>

3315
02:19:19.990 --> 02:19:20.823
<v Speaker 5>I believe it too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it goes back to what we're </v>

3316
02:19:21.461 --> 02:19:24.130
<v Speaker 5>talking about when we're saying that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people aren't designed for cities,</v>

3317
02:19:24.131 --> 02:19:28.310
<v Speaker 5>they're not designed for this life and </v>
<v Speaker 5>for televisions and lights that you just</v>

3318
02:19:28.311 --> 02:19:29.144
<v Speaker 5>switch on and off that were really </v>
<v Speaker 5>designed to say the reason why you feel </v>

3319
02:19:31.581 --> 02:19:32.414
<v Speaker 5>so content when you're in the mountains </v>
<v Speaker 5>and set your body's designed for that </v>

3320
02:19:34.980 --> 02:19:36.060
<v Speaker 5>literally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3324
02:19:42.590 --> 02:19:45.620
<v Speaker 5>I feel I hate the city.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you know the anti hunting people?</v>

3325
02:19:45.621 --> 02:19:46.454
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just,</v>

3326
02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:49.820
<v Speaker 5>they get food easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's easy to get food.</v>

3327
02:19:49.850 --> 02:19:52.350
<v Speaker 5>You should wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would turn the brand.</v>

3328
02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:55.430
<v Speaker 5>They would fucking all listened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've all of you.</v>

3329
02:19:55.431 --> 02:19:57.770
<v Speaker 5>You would shoot a rabbit right in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>face if you were starving,</v>

3330
02:19:57.771 --> 02:19:59.540
<v Speaker 5>your kids were crying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>guaranteed.</v>

3331
02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:01.670
<v Speaker 5>If it gets ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it all gets ugly,</v>

3332
02:20:01.671 --> 02:20:03.980
<v Speaker 5>you become a predator.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guaranteed.</v>

3333
02:20:04.010 --> 02:20:06.950
<v Speaker 5>Guaranteed because animals are going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunt you to fuck face.</v>

3334
02:20:06.951 --> 02:20:07.784
<v Speaker 5>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're out there in the woods by </v>

3335
02:20:08.961 --> 02:20:09.794
<v Speaker 5>yourself and you're making a lean to and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to fight the coyote that's </v>

3336
02:20:12.290 --> 02:20:14.090
<v Speaker 5>trying to drag your kid off in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle of the night.</v>

3337
02:20:14.250 --> 02:20:15.083
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That coyote gets roasted over an open </v>

3338
02:20:16.251 --> 02:20:18.560
<v Speaker 5>fire with a big smile on your face.</v>

3339
02:20:18.580 --> 02:20:21.050
<v Speaker 5>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brendan put up a picture of the grizzly.</v>

3340
02:20:21.051 --> 02:20:24.040
<v Speaker 5>I killed up on his page yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tom.</v>

3341
02:20:24.050 --> 02:20:29.000
<v Speaker 5>I've got a tsunami but her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had to take imaginable to text me and</v>

3342
02:20:29.001 --> 02:20:32.180
<v Speaker 5>telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry about all the hate and I'm like.</v>

3343
02:20:32.650 --> 02:20:33.483
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

3344
02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:35.030
<v Speaker 5>I just told him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3345
02:20:35.031 --> 02:20:36.290
<v Speaker 5>you gotta take the good with the bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

3346
02:20:36.291 --> 02:20:38.660
<v Speaker 5>this is all part of the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting to people,</v>

3347
02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:39.553
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't understand like here's my </v>

3348
02:20:41.211 --> 02:20:42.044
<v Speaker 5>favorite one ever when you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about bear hunting and like you were </v>

3349
02:20:45.201 --> 02:20:46.034
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that the bear populations have </v>

3350
02:20:47.451 --> 02:20:48.284
<v Speaker 5>to be controlled and the woman on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>show was because you've killed off all </v>

3351
02:20:50.511 --> 02:20:52.760
<v Speaker 5>their predators.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like What are you talking about?</v>

3352
02:20:52.761 --> 02:20:53.600
<v Speaker 5>Dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bitch,</v>

3353
02:20:53.900 --> 02:20:56.930
<v Speaker 5>what the hell is killing grizzly bear?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you crazy?</v>

3354
02:20:57.410 --> 02:21:00.550
<v Speaker 5>The only thing that kills grizzly bears </v>
<v Speaker 5>his other grizzly bears,</v>

3355
02:21:00.890 --> 02:21:04.640
<v Speaker 5>unless you want to have a grizzly bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cannibal apocalypse going on up there,</v>

3356
02:21:04.970 --> 02:21:06.080
<v Speaker 5>you've got to control their numbers.</v>

3357
02:21:06.140 --> 02:21:07.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

3358
02:21:07.370 --> 02:21:09.110
<v Speaker 5>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I told brendan that too.</v>

3359
02:21:09.111 --> 02:21:09.681
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

3360
02:21:09.681 --> 02:21:11.960
<v Speaker 5>these people just don't realize that if </v>
<v Speaker 5>the grizzlies,</v>

3361
02:21:12.170 --> 02:21:13.003
<v Speaker 5>the brown bears up there where you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>kill two a year because there's so many </v>

3362
02:21:15.561 --> 02:21:19.850
<v Speaker 5>of them that if we didn't control and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there'd be no moose deer,</v>

3363
02:21:19.851 --> 02:21:20.760
<v Speaker 5>there'd be no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of,</v>

3364
02:21:21.020 --> 02:21:21.853
<v Speaker 5>especially the moose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just focus on those moose when the </v>

3365
02:21:24.081 --> 02:21:28.220
<v Speaker 5>calves are dropping and so there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>follow up the pregnant female around and</v>

3366
02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:32.510
<v Speaker 5>eat the calf when it drops and with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>without us controlling them,</v>

3367
02:21:32.511 --> 02:21:35.610
<v Speaker 5>those it'd be gone 100 percent sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>similar,</v>

3368
02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:36.783
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know exactly the numbers or </v>

3369
02:21:37.941 --> 02:21:39.680
<v Speaker 5>anything aBout a great white sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3370
02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:43.690
<v Speaker 5>Like everyone's protected those for so </v>
<v Speaker 5>long that then like that's,</v>

3371
02:21:43.770 --> 02:21:48.770
<v Speaker 5>that will start screwing up the cycle </v>
<v Speaker 5>because then you're the tuna.</v>

3372
02:21:50.300 --> 02:21:52.010
<v Speaker 5>So let me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna get this wrong,</v>

3373
02:21:52.011 --> 02:21:52.844
<v Speaker 5>but the tuna population,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we're taking all the tuna </v>

3374
02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:56.073
<v Speaker 5>population,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone's so psycho over tuna and raw </v>

3375
02:21:57.681 --> 02:21:58.360
<v Speaker 5>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3376
02:21:58.360 --> 02:21:59.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then,</v>

3377
02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:04.070
<v Speaker 5>and we're protecting all the great white</v>
<v Speaker 5>sharks and some of the other sharks,</v>

3378
02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:05.193
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've just completely off balance the </v>

3379
02:22:06.711 --> 02:22:11.390
<v Speaker 5>situation because that's what they eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>

3380
02:22:11.630 --> 02:22:12.463
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anytime people intervene in the natural </v>

3381
02:22:14.061 --> 02:22:18.170
<v Speaker 5>world and step in and do one thing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>not the others,</v>

3382
02:22:18.410 --> 02:22:20.430
<v Speaker 5>we have to intervene sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we have,</v>

3383
02:22:20.510 --> 02:22:23.210
<v Speaker 5>we get animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just don't manage themselves.</v>

3384
02:22:23.211 --> 02:22:25.770
<v Speaker 5>What I mean by intervene is like what </v>
<v Speaker 5>they did in Australia where they brought</v>

3385
02:22:25.771 --> 02:22:29.880
<v Speaker 5>over a feral cats to control the rats </v>
<v Speaker 5>and rabbits and then they started eating</v>

3386
02:22:29.881 --> 02:22:30.714
<v Speaker 5>the ground nesting birds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they bring in fox is to try to kill </v>

3387
02:22:32.821 --> 02:22:36.890
<v Speaker 5>the cats and the foxes kill everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the cats and ga's us.</v>

3388
02:22:38.190 --> 02:22:41.790
<v Speaker 5>Why did they bring the way?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a long story,</v>

3389
02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:42.653
<v Speaker 5>but they brought in rabbits in Australia</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the rabbit population got out of </v>

3390
02:22:47.221 --> 02:22:49.920
<v Speaker 5>control and then they brought in cats </v>
<v Speaker 5>deal with the rabbits,</v>

3391
02:22:49.921 --> 02:22:51.600
<v Speaker 5>but the cast didn't just eat the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rabbits.</v>

3392
02:22:51.600 --> 02:22:52.433
<v Speaker 5>They also started decimating the ground </v>
<v Speaker 5>nesting birds and all the other local </v>

3393
02:22:55.621 --> 02:22:56.454
<v Speaker 5>rodents and then they brought another </v>
<v Speaker 5>things to deal with the cats and now </v>

3394
02:22:59.281 --> 02:23:03.000
<v Speaker 5>hunters are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Australia is weird.</v>

3395
02:23:03.350 --> 02:23:06.880
<v Speaker 5>They're hunting magazines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Water buffalo are not from there.</v>

3396
02:23:06.990 --> 02:23:08.040
<v Speaker 5>That's true too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>From asia.</v>

3397
02:23:08.041 --> 02:23:08.874
<v Speaker 5>Everything in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the stags and crocodiles heard right </v>

3398
02:23:12.190 --> 02:23:14.250
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of the big american crocodile.</v>

3399
02:23:14.251 --> 02:23:19.230
<v Speaker 5>we're not sure about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think they're from Australia.</v>

3400
02:23:19.470 --> 02:23:20.303
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Salt water crocs are huge and there's a </v>

3401
02:23:21.850 --> 02:23:25.700
<v Speaker 5>bigger american alligator and american </v>
<v Speaker 5>alligator over there.</v>

3402
02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:26.673
<v Speaker 5>They have alligators and Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe there are no red and then I'm </v>

3403
02:23:29.521 --> 02:23:30.354
<v Speaker 5>not sure about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I do know that they show cats in </v>

3404
02:23:34.711 --> 02:23:37.470
<v Speaker 5>their hunting magazines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're hunting magazines.</v>

3405
02:23:37.500 --> 02:23:39.780
<v Speaker 5>Dudes hold up catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got one might like,</v>

3406
02:23:39.781 --> 02:23:43.680
<v Speaker 5>and they think it's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's the same as in America.</v>

3407
02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:47.760
<v Speaker 5>If you killed like a coyote that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>killing all the neighborhood pets,</v>

3408
02:23:48.060 --> 02:23:48.893
<v Speaker 5>people would shoot it with a bow and </v>
<v Speaker 5>arrow and then take a picture of it and </v>

3409
02:23:50.731 --> 02:23:51.690
<v Speaker 5>they'd be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3410
02:23:51.691 --> 02:23:53.800
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got that fucking kitty cat,</v>

3411
02:23:53.801 --> 02:23:54.634
<v Speaker 5>eaton coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's how these people are in </v>

3412
02:23:56.461 --> 02:23:59.620
<v Speaker 5>Australia with a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all just culturally relative.</v>

3413
02:23:59.890 --> 02:24:00.490
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3414
02:24:00.490 --> 02:24:03.170
<v Speaker 5>it's no different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When we were there last time I was there</v>

3415
02:24:03.630 --> 02:24:06.030
<v Speaker 5>had this big,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a white stallion,</v>

3416
02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:07.650
<v Speaker 5>abrahm bs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they could sell.</v>

3417
02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:08.910
<v Speaker 5>Just a horse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3418
02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:10.500
<v Speaker 5>coming and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3419
02:24:10.501 --> 02:24:11.340
<v Speaker 5>adam's telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

3420
02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:12.930
<v Speaker 5>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

3421
02:24:12.980 --> 02:24:14.370
<v Speaker 5>that's a trophy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should,</v>

3422
02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:15.870
<v Speaker 5>you should kill that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

3423
02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:18.540
<v Speaker 5>why didn't kill a freaking horse dude?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

3424
02:24:18.990 --> 02:24:20.490
<v Speaker 5>but it's a brumby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3425
02:24:20.491 --> 02:24:22.500
<v Speaker 5>so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was by itself.</v>

3426
02:24:22.530 --> 02:24:24.000
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looked awesome.</v>

3427
02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:27.600
<v Speaker 5>It comes all the way up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm praying it would go somewhere else.</v>

3428
02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:28.950
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it comes 20 yards.</v>

3429
02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:33.220
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's just because you know,</v>

3430
02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:35.480
<v Speaker 5>where we grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where we left the condition to,</v>

3431
02:24:35.550 --> 02:24:38.160
<v Speaker 5>to them horses too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then that's just,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's something to hunt.</v>

<v Speaker 5>the restaurant.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Montreal and they serve horse.</v>

02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:55.890
<v Speaker 5>So it was like raw horse and the horse </v>
<v Speaker 5>loin.</v>

3438
02:24:55.891 --> 02:24:56.730

02:24:57.260 --> 02:25:00.560
<v Speaker 5>it's an amazing restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they're like super creative with the</v>

3440
02:25:00.570 --> 02:25:03.330
<v Speaker 5>dishes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And both times I was there,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I like horses.</v>

3443
02:25:08.130 --> 02:25:08.963
<v Speaker 5>It was one of the biggest problems we </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever had on fear factor we made keep </v>

3444
02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:13.860
<v Speaker 5>lead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Horse rectum can always.</v>

3445

<v Speaker 5>That was the stop because it was for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because not because his rectum,</v>

3449
02:25:25.541 --> 02:25:28.810

<v Speaker 5>Not a peep out of people.</v>

3450
02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:32.420
<v Speaker 5>Nobody said a damn thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but horse rectum,</v>

3451
02:25:32.460 --> 02:25:33.430
<v Speaker 5>a huge issue.</v>

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3458
02:25:49.490 --> 02:25:50.323
<v Speaker 5>it fizzled out the first time because it</v>
<v Speaker 5>had just did a 148 episodes and it was </v>

3459
02:25:53.951 --> 02:25:54.784
<v Speaker 5>just enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was enough and they never really got </v>

3460
02:25:55.751 --> 02:25:56.584
<v Speaker 5>canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just kind of stopped doing it and </v>

3461
02:25:58.211 --> 02:25:59.050
<v Speaker 5>everybody was done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.983
<v Speaker 5>I was just fucking stop and we walked </v>
<v Speaker 5>away from it and then several years </v>

3463
02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:04.033
<v Speaker 5>later it came back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We did six episodes and it was canceled </v>

3464
02:26:06.461 --> 02:26:08.980
<v Speaker 5>because we made people drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come.</v>

<v Speaker 5>oddly enough.</v>

3467
02:26:18.490 --> 02:26:19.323
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like relatively normal comparison </v>

3468
02:26:21.881 --> 02:26:23.180
<v Speaker 5>to the con,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that was it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Tmz got ahold of some of the photos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some leaked photos with the donkey </v>

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's wait until the publicist losing </v>
<v Speaker 5>her mind somewhere.</v>

3593
02:31:40.350 --> 02:31:42.720
<v Speaker 5>That's why we took her off air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3594
02:31:43.390 --> 02:31:44.840
<v Speaker 5>we're off air.</v>

3595
02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:46.133

3596
02:31:47.641 --> 02:31:49.950
<v Speaker 5>and you wouldn't hunt that because you </v>

3601
02:31:55.980 --> 02:31:57.990

3602
02:31:58.050 --> 02:32:00.630
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing is it's also an important tool</v>

3603
02:32:00.631 --> 02:32:03.870
<v Speaker 5>for conservation because they really do </v>
<v Speaker 5>need to keep those populations down.</v>

3604
02:32:03.871 --> 02:32:05.310
<v Speaker 5>Especially in alberta.</v>

<v Speaker 5>where they are.</v>

3608
02:32:12.391 --> 02:32:14.190
<v Speaker 5>If you go with the other goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere,</v>

3609
02:32:14.191 --> 02:32:15.001
<v Speaker 5>that's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 5>river.</v>

3616
02:32:28.770 --> 02:32:29.603
<v Speaker 5>You take up and they pan out to the rest</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the river and you see like a dozen </v>

3617
02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:37.410
<v Speaker 5>grizzlies wandering through this river </v>
<v Speaker 5>jack and all these salmon.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>what the fuck you imagine you're sitting</v>

3620
02:32:43.291 --> 02:32:44.124
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This thing just pulls up within 15 feet </v>

3621
02:32:45.451 --> 02:32:46.284
<v Speaker 5>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are only alive because it chooses </v>

3622
02:32:49.351 --> 02:32:51.990
<v Speaker 5>not to eat you because it's got a belly </v>
<v Speaker 5>full of salmon.</v>

3623
02:32:52.470 --> 02:32:55.380
<v Speaker 5>So this guy is sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This bear just,</v>

3624
02:32:55.381 --> 02:32:57.330
<v Speaker 5>he has to chase it off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has to yell at it.</v>

3625
02:32:57.520 --> 02:33:01.110
<v Speaker 5>It's feet away from him and easily a </v>
<v Speaker 5>thousand pounds.</v>

3626
02:33:01.111 --> 02:33:02.550
<v Speaker 5>It's an enormous bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3628
02:33:07.170 --> 02:33:10.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not like you can look at a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bear and tell.</v>

3629
02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:12.270
<v Speaker 5>It's not like a dog with a wagging tail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3630
02:33:12.271 --> 02:33:14.280
<v Speaker 5>you don't know that bear could think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3631
02:33:14.340 --> 02:33:16.500
<v Speaker 5>I just don't feel like killing you next </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

3632
02:33:16.800 --> 02:33:17.221
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>

3634
02:33:18.260 --> 02:33:20.790
<v Speaker 5>there's no difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our big bear family,</v>

3635
02:33:20.850 --> 02:33:21.683
<v Speaker 5>best buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people see this stuff and they </v>

3636
02:33:24.001 --> 02:33:24.834
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3637
02:33:24.970 --> 02:33:28.920
<v Speaker 5>barriers were friends with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>got up there.</v>

3638
02:33:28.960 --> 02:33:30.390
<v Speaker 5>Who's the mayor?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3639
02:33:31.050 --> 02:33:33.690
<v Speaker 5>And you can't find the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3640
02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:35.730
<v Speaker 5>Timothy treadwell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever see that documentary?</v>

3641
02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:39.810
<v Speaker 5>The grizzly man losing anybody listening</v>
<v Speaker 5>to this who hasn't seen it?</v>

3642
02:33:40.190 --> 02:33:40.830
<v Speaker 5>This is what you do.</v>

3643
02:33:40.830 --> 02:33:41.663
<v Speaker 5>You smoke some of that devil's cabbage </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you sit in front of the old netflix </v>

3644
02:33:44.580 --> 02:33:45.413
<v Speaker 5>and he watched grizzly man because it is</v>
<v Speaker 5>a god damn unintentional comedy really </v>

3645
02:33:49.921 --> 02:33:51.460
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an unintentional comedy.</v>

3646
02:33:51.500 --> 02:33:52.333
<v Speaker 5>So many comedic beats in that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was supposed to interview werner </v>

3647
02:33:54.511 --> 02:33:55.344
<v Speaker 5>herzog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was on a tour last summer and this </v>

3648
02:33:57.990 --> 02:33:58.823
<v Speaker 5>past didn't work out and we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'd never wound up doing the podcast </v>

3649
02:34:01.321 --> 02:34:02.630
<v Speaker 5>together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that was the first thing I was going</v>

3650
02:34:02.631 --> 02:34:03.390
<v Speaker 5>to ask him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3651
02:34:03.390 --> 02:34:04.223
<v Speaker 5>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you intentionally put comedic beats </v>

3652
02:34:06.121 --> 02:34:08.970
<v Speaker 5>into that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because there's one part where there was</v>

3653
02:34:08.971 --> 02:34:09.804
<v Speaker 5>a sheriff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

3654
02:34:09.870 --> 02:34:14.870
<v Speaker 5>I thought he was retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that laughing.</v>

3655
02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:19.953
<v Speaker 5>He thought he was retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it gives me after the guy got eaten </v>

3656
02:34:21.311 --> 02:34:22.144
<v Speaker 5>by the bear because he was up there like</v>
<v Speaker 5>way past when you're supposed to be up </v>

3657
02:34:24.401 --> 02:34:26.620
<v Speaker 5>there too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was out there past friends.</v>

3658
02:34:27.030 --> 02:34:29.650
<v Speaker 5>They were friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's one scene.</v>

3659
02:34:29.830 --> 02:34:31.540
<v Speaker 5>This is mrs chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's right here.</v>

3661
02:34:33.241 --> 02:34:35.470
<v Speaker 5>This came out of her butt and he's like </v>
<v Speaker 5>picking it up.</v>

3662
02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:36.813
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's tell warm to warm because it was </v>

3663
02:34:38.501 --> 02:34:39.334
<v Speaker 5>inside of her and that's just a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>example of the bear might not kill you </v>

3664
02:34:44.021 --> 02:34:46.510
<v Speaker 5>just because they don't feel like it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when they feel like it,</v>

3665
02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:47.700
<v Speaker 5>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's over.</v>

3666
02:34:47.701 --> 02:34:50.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean not a goddamn thing you going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do about it.</v>

3667
02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:53.440
<v Speaker 5>Not a god damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're a wild animal.</v>

3668
02:34:53.441 --> 02:34:56.170
<v Speaker 5>It's just like it's even the bears that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we had up in alberta.</v>

3669
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:58.390
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know.</v>

3670
02:34:58.420 --> 02:35:01.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean they could decide they're wild </v>
<v Speaker 5>animals that any at any one.</v>

3671
02:35:01.570 --> 02:35:03.600

<v Speaker 5>there's bears that you can't really get </v>

3673
02:35:06.791 --> 02:35:08.320
<v Speaker 5>a read on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just like a dog.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3676
02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:14.230

<v Speaker 5>all animals have different personalities</v>

3677
02:35:14.231 --> 02:35:15.340
<v Speaker 5>like cats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dogs,</v>

3678
02:35:15.341 --> 02:35:17.110
<v Speaker 5>domestic animals have weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>personalities.</v>

3679
02:35:17.240 --> 02:35:19.750
<v Speaker 5>Wild animals do too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just most of them can't kill you,</v>

3680
02:35:19.810 --> 02:35:21.880
<v Speaker 5>but bears can mean that 10.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3734
02:37:38.931 --> 02:37:39.764
<v Speaker 5>powerful setup we were practicing today </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's just so evident that these </v>

3735
02:37:42.471 --> 02:37:44.420
<v Speaker 5>heavy arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so much momentum.</v>

3736
02:37:44.421 --> 02:37:46.940
<v Speaker 5>You're at 687 grains.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what that is?</v>

3737
02:37:46.941 --> 02:37:47.774
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3739
02:37:49.281 --> 02:37:50.114
<v Speaker 5>we were talking grams before and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>meant to say grains and then we're </v>

3740
02:37:53.481 --> 02:37:57.620
<v Speaker 5>converting grams to marijuana and </v>
<v Speaker 5>calculations.</v>

3741
02:37:57.700 --> 02:37:58.533
<v Speaker 5>Just don't mix.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're doing this a long time ago on a </v>

3742
02:38:00.681 --> 02:38:02.480
<v Speaker 5>podcast and then I was driving home and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3743
02:38:02.481 --> 02:38:03.314
<v Speaker 5>jesus christ,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do we say grams when I met grains and </v>

3744
02:38:06.201 --> 02:38:07.034
<v Speaker 5>that we're trying to figure out how many</v>
<v Speaker 5>grams we're in an ounce and they were </v>

3745
02:38:09.420 --> 02:38:12.700
<v Speaker 5>determining that it was a pound,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like four,</v>

3746
02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:14.860
<v Speaker 5>500 grams in a pound.</v>

3747
02:38:15.170 --> 02:38:16.790
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but arrows not a pound,</v>

3748
02:38:16.791 --> 02:38:17.624
<v Speaker 5>like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we just kept talking on something </v>

3749
02:38:18.821 --> 02:38:21.110
<v Speaker 5>else and then it took me a while to like</v>
<v Speaker 5>figure it out.</v>

3750
02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:23.030
<v Speaker 5>It's like saying I was reading a </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast,</v>

02:39:49.940 --> 02:39:52.790
<v Speaker 5>He said something about vin diesel was </v>
<v Speaker 5>one time,</v>

3784
02:39:52.791 --> 02:39:53.624
<v Speaker 5>one time he doesn't like la.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I live in san diego and so this is camp </v>

3785
02:39:57.651 --> 02:39:58.484
<v Speaker 5>sneaking up on this water buffalo and </v>
<v Speaker 5>every time it picks up its eyes or it </v>

3786
02:40:01.521 --> 02:40:03.440
<v Speaker 5>might've caught movement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he has to pause.</v>

3787
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:08.590
<v Speaker 5>So this is ridiculously slow truck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm.</v>

3788
02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:13.540
<v Speaker 5>I think it's still a little bit before I</v>
<v Speaker 5>shoot away.</v>

3789
02:40:13.610 --> 02:40:13.910
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3790
02:40:13.910 --> 02:40:14.743
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3791
02:40:14.850 --> 02:40:15.683
<v Speaker 2>It's getting closer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got my range finder there so I can </v>

3792
02:40:17.970 --> 02:40:20.100
<v Speaker 2>quickly get it because I'm getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>closer every time.</v>

3793
02:40:20.580 --> 02:40:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about range finding by</v>

3794
02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:26.100
<v Speaker 2>nose stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a don't move.</v>

3795
02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:29.520
<v Speaker 2>Don't move with the hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's coming out.</v>

3796
02:40:29.550 --> 02:40:30.840
<v Speaker 2>You did you hide behind that little </v>
<v Speaker 2>tree?</v>

3797
02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:33.090
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wrestle it down.</v>

3798
02:40:33.270 --> 02:40:34.103
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man.</v>

3799
02:40:34.690 --> 02:40:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Scrap wood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It needs.</v>

3800
02:40:37.730 --> 02:40:40.770
<v Speaker 2>The hit you hAd on your podcast can take</v>
<v Speaker 2>down a wolf.</v>

3801
02:40:40.771 --> 02:40:42.230
<v Speaker 2>What was that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan pena.</v>

3802
02:40:42.490 --> 02:40:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Pena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3803
02:40:43.140 --> 02:40:45.360
<v Speaker 2>He would just dab it in the dick over </v>
<v Speaker 2>and over again.</v>

3804
02:40:45.450 --> 02:40:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Sat right in the deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's a creeping up.</v>

3805
02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:49.853
<v Speaker 2>Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you thoughts on range finding </v>

3806
02:40:50.611 --> 02:40:51.900
<v Speaker 2>binary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever use those?</v>

3807
02:40:52.350 --> 02:40:53.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you?</v>

3808
02:40:54.030 --> 02:40:54.863
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I know like there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies that make some that bow </v>

3809
02:40:56.810 --> 02:40:59.160
<v Speaker 2>hunters use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like leica laika has one that apparently</v>

3810
02:40:59.161 --> 02:41:02.280
<v Speaker 2>has a button on the righthand side so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can range and shoot with one hand.</v>

3811
02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:03.593
<v Speaker 2>This is adam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he was such that </v>

3812
02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:09.240
<v Speaker 2>shipment would be a trophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>

3813
02:41:09.270 --> 02:41:12.960
<v Speaker 2>here's some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a good illustration of having.</v>

3814
02:41:13.410 --> 02:41:16.260
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno what I'm trying to promote here,</v>

3815
02:41:16.410 --> 02:41:20.070
<v Speaker 2>but a hard hitting arrow because if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wash when I shoot this buffalo,</v>

3816
02:41:20.490 --> 02:41:21.323
<v Speaker 2>the arrow arcs up and actually hits the </v>
<v Speaker 2>branch and ricochets and still kills </v>

3817
02:41:26.611 --> 02:41:27.840
<v Speaker 2>that buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3818
02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to hit a ricochet off.</v>

3819
02:41:34.051 --> 02:41:36.390
<v Speaker 2>That still killed us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big bastard.</v>

3820
02:41:36.490 --> 02:41:39.090
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of deceptive here.</v>

3821
02:41:39.091 --> 02:41:41.490
<v Speaker 2>How many yards do you out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be 40.</v>

3822
02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like he's like 10 feet in front</v>

3823
02:41:43.801 --> 02:41:44.480
<v Speaker 2>of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3824
02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:47.460
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can because it's fucking huge.</v>

3825
02:41:47.570 --> 02:41:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Just skip ahead a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3826
02:41:48.950 --> 02:41:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Skip ahead a little bit loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3827
02:41:52.660 --> 02:41:53.493
<v Speaker 2>Backup backup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it looks like you already shot </v>

3828
02:41:55.031 --> 02:41:55.380
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3829
02:41:55.380 --> 02:41:57.360
<v Speaker 2>Backup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Backup,</v>

3830
02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:00.490
<v Speaker 2>backup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scared.</v>

3831
02:42:00.510 --> 02:42:01.343
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>

3832
02:42:04.140 --> 02:42:07.410
<v Speaker 2>See that kind of touched it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost barely grazed it.</v>

3833
02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:08.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it affected the flight but still </v>

3834
02:42:09.931 --> 02:42:13.920
<v Speaker 2>went and pounded in here and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right where you want to.</v>

3835
02:42:14.390 --> 02:42:16.710
<v Speaker 2>That's right into the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where their heart is.</v>

3836
02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:18.073
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you would have got more </v>
<v Speaker 2>penetration but didn't graze that </v>

3837
02:42:19.441 --> 02:42:20.370
<v Speaker 2>branch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3838
02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:21.720
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But still,</v>

3839
02:42:21.721 --> 02:42:23.500
<v Speaker 2>that's a 90 pound ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3840
02:42:23.550 --> 02:42:26.280
<v Speaker 2>And it's going in six inches deep into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the heart.</v>

3841
02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:27.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably more than that because those </v>

3842
02:42:28.141 --> 02:42:29.520
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that shoulders.</v>

3843
02:42:30.380 --> 02:42:32.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in probably 18 inches.</v>

3844
02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:35.880
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is like what just </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened?</v>

3845
02:42:35.881 --> 02:42:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Now it doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

3846
02:42:37.290 --> 02:42:38.123
<v Speaker 2>it runs into that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's really crazy is that cam was </v>

3847
02:42:42.331 --> 02:42:45.690
<v Speaker 2>saying that he chewed a piece of meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that animal.</v>

3848
02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:49.230
<v Speaker 2>It was so tough and so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You treat it for a whole half hour.</v>

3849
02:42:49.231 --> 02:42:50.450
<v Speaker 2>One piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3850
02:42:50.790 --> 02:42:51.623
<v Speaker 2>As like shoe leather because that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is an old bull to tank these things or </v>

3851
02:42:56.280 --> 02:42:57.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

3852
02:42:57.660 --> 02:43:00.300
<v Speaker 2>1800 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to shoot,</v>

3853
02:43:01.050 --> 02:43:04.320
<v Speaker 2>you have to shoot heavy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you think you're going to be doing</v>

3854
02:43:04.321 --> 02:43:05.154
<v Speaker 2>that from now on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be going to a heavier </v>

3855
02:43:06.331 --> 02:43:08.610
<v Speaker 2>arrow are in the range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
