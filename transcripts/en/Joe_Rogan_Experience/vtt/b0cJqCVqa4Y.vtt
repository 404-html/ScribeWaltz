1
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.120
I never known how to start these.
I never know how it's just start.
It's weird.

2
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:12.840
Sometimes you do that breathing thing.
Lately I keep getting excited.

3
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:14.310
It's been relaxed,
harmonic breathing

4
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.670
in through the nose folks and then I'll do the mouth relaxing.

5
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.540
That's how you supposed to breathe.
It's like that's how you,

6
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.920
that's something you taught me with comedy.

7
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.770
Like lot of times I catch myself doing that and I hear you in the back of my

8
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:32.160
head.
Just like breathe in and breathe out,
breathing deep breaths and I was like,

9
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:36.290
wow.
It really does work.
You can get stuck on stage without any air.
Yeah.

10
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.280
We fucked up and didn't plan your breaths and then people were staring and

11
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.710
staring at you going,
why the fuck should we be paying attention?
You stupid.

12
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.220
So you've done that before.
We were like,
you can't even finish a sentence here.

13
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.590
Fairly recently.
Timed it badly.
You know where I pulled it off,

14
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:56.040
but it's like yikes for close to not.
Anyway,

15
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.130
the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o,

16
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:03.420
n n I t,
makers of Alpha brain,
new mood,
shroom,
tech,
sport,
shroom,

17
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:07.050
tech immune and dude,
we got battle ropes now bitches.

18
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.390
We got kettle bells.
The uh,

19
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.990
hemp force protein powder is in route.

20
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.280
I have a sample right here at Joe Rogan compound.

21
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.780
So,
uh,
we got a lot of good shit coming with on at.com and some stuff that we're

22
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.430
actually gonna talk about on the podcast.

23
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.960
But if you're interested in any of this stuff,

24
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:29.730
I always encourage anyone who's interested in the topic of nootropics to Google

25
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:34.470
it.
Go and Google it,
read all the pros and the cons and know this,

26
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.940
if there's anything that we're selling on this show,
anything,
whether it's,

27
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.961
you know,

28
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:43.230
whether I'm telling you that I support Alienware computers because they support

29
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:47.070
MMA,
whether it's the,
the fleshlight,
whether it's any,

30
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:51.330
anything that we sell on the show,
we only sell some shit that's legit.

31
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.720
And I personally am a huge fan of vitamins and nutrients taking care of your

32
00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:03.850
body.
Meanwhile,
just ate a sausage sub,
stupid sausage side.

33
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.320
Did a Wendy's right?
Is so awesome.

34
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.300
There's a Deli in Canoga park that's so fucking old school Italian and they had

35
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:15.480
a sausage.
Seven I couldn't pass.
But for the most part and eat healthy,
I like,

36
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.080
I will punish myself for that and I want to allow myself anything shit for days

37
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:22.890
and days.
But that look worth it though.
It was a little bit worth it.

38
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.920
That's worth it.
I believe in cheat days,
man,
I believe,

39
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:27.720
but I believe you should earn those bitches.

40
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.590
And for the most part you should beat and healthy healthy is fuck you.

41
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:35.160
Dirty freaks.
So,
um,
that's what,

42
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.630
that's what these nootropics are all about.
It's all about increasing your,

43
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:41.850
your brain's ability to produce neurotransmitters from wasn't the best way to

44
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:44.370
describe it.
That would be it.
Yep.

45
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.470
And Aubrey and I both have had a tremendous amount of experience taking these

46
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:52.200
things long before we ever became involved in,

47
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:54.430
in selling them and distributing them.
Um,

48
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.360
if there's a bunch of different formulas out there,
a lot of them are good.

49
00:02:57.361 --> 00:03:02.110
I think ours is the best.
And,
uh,
if you want to try it and give it a shot,

50
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.130
the first 30 pills,

51
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:07.090
we have a 100% money back guarantee so you don't even have to return the
product.

52
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:08.980
You don't like it,
you get your money back.

53
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.770
We're that confident that it's that good.
We're that confident.

54
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:13.810
You're going to love it and you're going to get hooked on it and you're going to

55
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:17.030
be like me.
I didn't take any before the show.
Give me the back quickly.

56
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.660
I panicked.

57
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.140
I panicked that you find out how stupid I am without pot and Alpha brain.

58
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.630
I couldn't work.
I couldn't work.
I could work,
but I wouldn't be very good.

59
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.730
It's become an addict.
I wouldn't be the same ladies and gentlemen.

60
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.020
I wouldn't be the same way.

61
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:35.530
And once you get used to those heightened levels of neurotransmitters.
Yeah,
man,

62
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:36.830
high levels a neurotransmitter's.

63
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.940
Then I'm really addicted to weed when it comes to writing.
I'm telling you,

64
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.190
I sit down and try to write without weed and then I just go,

65
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:44.800
what the fuck are you doing?
Stupid.
This study's about weed.

66
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.420
What about released a yesterday that that there again,

67
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:54.421
they went through it and that there was no signs of it being dangerous to your

68
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:58.760
body or anything at all.
The LD 50 rate is 1500 pounds.
Yeah.

69
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.590
Then know that means that means lethal dose at 50% of the humans.

70
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.510
I mean it would kill the weak bitches,

71
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.290
so you'd have to smoke 1500 pounds to kill the weak vegges.
Guess what?

72
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:12.880
You're not killing Joey [inaudible].
Joey Diaz laughs that you have 1500 pounds.

73
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.210
He'd give him 1500 pounds of weed and he'll just be running around naked

74
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.680
screaming at people.

75
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:20.170
You got something that you think you're going to kill me that easy.

76
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:21.910
That's not going to kill him.

77
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.160
1500 pounds unless you dropped it out of a CIA drug planet landed on his fucking

78
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:29.830
head.
That's the only way we forced trauma.

79
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:33.400
The only way to kill the only way.
All Right Ladies Gentlemen,

80
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.490
our Pal Aubrey is back from the fucking jungles of Peru with another Iowasca

81
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:43.170
adventure.
We're going to,
we're going to get deep experience.

82
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.040
<v 1>That's still is one of the proudest moments in my life</v>

83
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.340
<v 0>here in Nick Diaz.
Say That train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night.
Oh.</v>

84
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.810
So that was one of the happiest I've ever been as an adult.

85
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.040
That was like right up there with fucking anything else that's ever made me

86
00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:07.970
happy.
That was so killer.
So your back dude,

87
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.260
I'm back back.
Yeah.

88
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.820
How many times a year are you trying to do these intense experiences?

89
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.750
Well,
you know,
after this last experience I kind of got the message that,

90
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.850
you know,
there wasn't too much left for me to explore in this,
but you know,

91
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.770
I kind of see myself as an adventure,
you know,
Cohen back tick,

92
00:05:24.771 --> 00:05:26.810
get knowledge and taking it back and sharing it.

93
00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:29.990
So when you say that in not too much left,

94
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.820
like I always feel like if I do it too much that I'm not absorbing what's

95
00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:38.930
happening.
I always feel like,
uh,
any,
if I have too many experiences in a row,

96
00:05:38.931 --> 00:05:42.970
like two or three in a couple of months,
I feel like I'm just playing.
I'm just a,

97
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:46.270
it's just,
I'm not just riding a ride.
I'm getting scared.
Right.
You know,

98
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.930
I know it takes a long time for it.
The big ones to make sense to them.
It,
yeah.

99
00:05:50.931 --> 00:05:51.591
I think there's,

100
00:05:51.591 --> 00:05:54.470
I think there's a certain amount of information that needs to kind of accumulate

101
00:05:54.471 --> 00:05:58.520
and you need to get farther off track for your experience to be really what the

102
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:01.370
people say that a real skeptics,
they'll say,
well,

103
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.440
what information like w w what does anybody ever brought back?
But so you know,

104
00:06:05.441 --> 00:06:06.060
there are there,

105
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.560
there is some anecdotal evidence is some things have been discovered.
One,

106
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:14.561
LSD and supposedly Francis Crick on his dying deathbed said that he'd LSD

107
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.320
covered the DNA marker.
Yeah,
but you know what,
man?
Fucking on my deathbed,

108
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.200
so many might say,
I turned Christian.
You know,
you're fucking dying man.

109
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:27.320
He just making shit up.
You know,
he's crazy.
He's dying.

110
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.890
We why his deathbed worth anything,
you know?
I mean death bed.
She'd be like,

111
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.430
don't listen to that dude.
He's fucking freaking out right now.
He's dying.
He,

112
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.840
why did you decide to make up some shit about LSD and the DNA mobs?

113
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.320
Fucking whatever.
I was dying.
I was tripping my balls off like,

114
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.340
but what have you,
like is there like one thing that you could,

115
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:50.200
like if someone said,
what do you ever bring back?
Is there one thing I can say?

116
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.140
I can give you three things from this last experience that were pretty poignant

117
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.150
life lessons that were told to me just directly flat out that I think will help

118
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:02.030
me for the rest of my life.
I mean actual concrete things.

119
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.140
This was a very different experience and I don't know if I should just go from

120
00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:08.750
the start or kind of hopping in the middle folks who don't know.

121
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.550
Aubrey had a recent one.
It was about what does it six months ago,
the last one?

122
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.660
Well the Boga was six months ago and then the last trip to Peru was a full year

123
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:17.690
ago.

124
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.190
So this was the anniversary of that first epic trip and out of the junk and the

125
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:23.550
first epic trip you,

126
00:07:23.551 --> 00:07:26.420
you went with the same guy that got age called the Dragon Dragon.
Yeah.

127
00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:31.421
And you had some insane visions and you communicated with Flo Tilos of snake.

128
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.970
Like what,
what,
what was it like?
Yeah,
I mean there was a,

129
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.170
the second experience I had,

130
00:07:36.171 --> 00:07:39.470
the first one was just basically coming to terms with my own mortal death.

131
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.210
I mean,
every possible way I could die,

132
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:46.211
snakes eating out my Oregon sliding down vines that thorns every possible way

133
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:49.910
that I could confront my death.
I had to go through,
even if he was even,

134
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.420
it was even telling me,
it was like,
your body is riddled with cancer,

135
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:56.720
you're gonna die as soon as you get back.
And I was like,
oh,
that one's,

136
00:07:56.721 --> 00:07:59.540
that was the one that got me actually the thorns and the snakes eating me and

137
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:03.500
actually the insects Burling and my skin and exploding all of that stuff.

138
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:05.780
I was like,
all right,
I'm cool with that.
Like I can get over that.

139
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:08.450
But then it was like,
your body is riddled with cancer and you're going to die.

140
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:13.520
And at that point,
what does heck exactly.
But at that point I had to be like,

141
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.090
okay,
you know,
this is the end,
so be it.
And as soon as that happened,

142
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.410
I could feel,
you know,

143
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:22.070
the medicine just kind of draw me back down into the ground and a deep sense of

144
00:08:22.071 --> 00:08:25.130
peace and I kind of conquering of a fear of suffering that I had.

145
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.670
So you had to just figure out how to let go of the idea that you're going to
die,

146
00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:32.600
which really is the one thing that fucks with almost everybody.
Number one,

147
00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:34.310
pervasive fear.
Yeah.

148
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.790
I've had that conversation yesterday with my four year old.

149
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:41.750
It's very strange when they started to be aware that you know that people will

150
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:43.880
cease to exist.
That's a tough one.

151
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:45.770
So that's why they call it the vine of death actually.

152
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:47.830
It's one of the reasons is because I watched them,

153
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.660
one of the first things it's gonna do,
it's gonna make you confront your death.

154
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.570
And if you're not ready for that,
you'll fight that.
And you know,

155
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.980
you'll battle with that until end,
but you got to just

156
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.540
<v 2>kind of get past that first step.</v>

157
00:08:57.541 --> 00:09:02.310
So fortunately the first session I had last time a year ago got me through that.

158
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:04.820
And then the next one I was just brought to,

159
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.720
to what the shamans called the eight dimension.

160
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:08.730
They call it out that that's just the paradigm that they use.

161
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:13.710
But it was just this unbelievably lucid place where I had to get me there.

162
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:14.251
I,
you know,

163
00:09:14.251 --> 00:09:17.670
I had a flotilla drawing smoke out of me and then I had another one that was

164
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:22.210
shooting a beam of light under my tongue.
And then I just,
yeah,
I,

165
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.070
it was the weirdest thing.
I have no,
I've since had some people say,
you know,

166
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:29.880
there's some Yogi practices where you absorb something or another between

167
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:31.710
underneath your tongue.
But I knew none of that now.

168
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:34.890
And I don't know if I necessarily subscribe to that even after reading it,

169
00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:37.140
but there is some kind of literature about and underneath the tongue.

170
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.280
But I just did it instinctively and this beam of light just goes piercing

171
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.140
through my tongue.
Yeah.
I wonder it's because p is sub,
uh,
um,

172
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.190
sublingual,
um,
drugs.
Yeah.
It's a very,
it's a very strong absorption side.

173
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.220
Yeah.
Like it's like the easiest way to absorb directly into your bloodstream.

174
00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:56.790
So it was kind of an odd,
odd thing for me to do without thinking about it.

175
00:09:56.791 --> 00:10:00.090
But after that happened,
I just burst into this other dimension.

176
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:03.750
And from that dimension I could see people that I wanted to see.

177
00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:07.110
I could scan my body,
I could look towards the future,
towards business,

178
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:08.220
towards anything,

179
00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:12.240
and everything was just perfectly lucid in this universe that didn't change no

180
00:10:12.241 --> 00:10:13.710
matter which direction I looked at.

181
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.900
And it was incredibly profound life changing experience in the last session,

182
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.040
did it seem,

183
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.490
when you were looking at like the world and all the different aspects of you,

184
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:24.600
have you have your world,

185
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.170
did it seem like something you're creating in your mind?
No,

186
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.650
it really didn't at this time.
You know,
and,
and I've had,

187
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.130
I've had some silly silicide and experiences and some other different

188
00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:40.080
experiences that seem very much like an exploration on a ride through my own

189
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:43.080
subconscious,
you know,
like going through the dream state processing,

190
00:10:43.081 --> 00:10:45.660
bad emotions,
bad feelings.
Um,

191
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.800
but something particular about the DMT experience and the Boga experience

192
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.610
transcends that kind of feeling like you're on a ride through dreamland,

193
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.040
you know,
that really is your own,
mind you,

194
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.070
it felt completely different because I was so lucid,

195
00:10:59.071 --> 00:11:03.210
I was so able to just navigate through a different space where only the shaman

196
00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:04.200
was sharing that space.

197
00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:07.980
The rest of the people around me were just these spindles of light that I could

198
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:10.650
kind of see through and I had full options to do whatever I want.

199
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.150
I even ran back to my cabin and shot a little video where I look really kind of

200
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:16.950
weird and a little bit freaked out.
But I was like,

201
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.250
I had to capture that moment because I was worried that I was going to forget
it.

202
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.480
So you've got a video of you talking about what you'd just turn experiencing

203
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.490
currently while you were already experiencing it currently.

204
00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:30.300
So I turned the camera on myself and I was like,
you know,
this is me.

205
00:11:30.301 --> 00:11:35.190
I made dimension of space of infinite possibilities and I'll show you there or

206
00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:36.024
something like that.
But,

207
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:41.180
but I had such freedom to just do whatever I wanted in that it seems almost

208
00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:44.220
impossible to me that that was generated by my own mind.

209
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.110
So what do you think it is then?
I mean,
it is generated by your,

210
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:53.100
your own mind interacting with a drug.
So,
but does that drug act as a doorway?

211
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.360
The new experiences?

212
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.240
<v 0>I think it does.
I think what DMT does is it opens up the realms of Pos,</v>

213
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.350
opens up the other dimensional realms where there's knowledge and information

214
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.190
that wants to come and access your brand.
And you know,

215
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:09.640
you want to receive information from those other,
other dimensions.

216
00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:13.570
And how it comes to you is generally there's a,
there's a translation gap.

217
00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:15.040
You know,
there's no Rosetta stone there.

218
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:17.410
So it comes through generally is pictures.

219
00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:19.270
And these pictures can often be very confusing,

220
00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:22.460
but it's really trying to translate information that it,

221
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.910
that your brain wants to get access to.

222
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.580
And the only way it knows how to do that is to show you pictures.

223
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:31.630
So you explore these pictures and find answers,
um,
from,

224
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.190
you know what I believe is another,

225
00:12:33.191 --> 00:12:37.960
either the collective unconsciousness of all people or another dimension that's

226
00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:40.240
even higher.
That's beyond people that transcends people.

227
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.130
That's a wisdom older than people.

228
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.760
And I think that's kind of where you're accessing this information.

229
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.660
I think also there's also some component of your own of your own mind and

230
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:52.570
consciousness.
But I think DMT in particular is a,

231
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:57.060
is a pretty unique molecule that really allows access from,
you know,

232
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.730
some other spaces that are non self-generated.
It certainly,

233
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.950
it certainly seems like that when you're doing it,

234
00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:04.660
but nobody knows what the fuck that really is.

235
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:08.140
What are you doing over there Brian?
Looking at cat pictures.
Okay,

236
00:13:08.141 --> 00:13:10.930
let's do that one.
The podcast.
It's very distracting.

237
00:13:10.931 --> 00:13:12.250
I'm looking at you on the screen.

238
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:18.460
If you want to look up cat pictures stretch us out so you don't have to be

239
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:23.380
looking like a fucking weirdo catch stalker corner.
Um,
um,

240
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.410
when,
when you,
when you take it and you have that feeling though,

241
00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:29.350
do you think it's possible that feeling is just a drug interacting with your

242
00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:31.660
mind?
Cause that's like what the skeptic would say.
Right?
Sure.

243
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.570
It's certainly possible.
I mean you can't,
you how do you,

244
00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:37.990
how can you rule that out?
And actually that's one of the things that,
you know,

245
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.600
and I'll get into that a little bit more in the second experience cause the

246
00:13:40.601 --> 00:13:43.090
second experience,
this one I just got back from,

247
00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:47.740
I had actual encounters with allies like different beings that were talking to

248
00:13:47.741 --> 00:13:49.870
me and that's the first time that's ever happened.

249
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:53.020
Like the last time they were giving you good advice.
Yeah.
Yeah.

250
00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:55.900
They were giving me good advice.
Do you think that that's possible,

251
00:13:55.901 --> 00:14:00.000
but that's like part of your personality.
That's definitely possible.
Impossible.

252
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:00.791
You know what I mean?

253
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:04.750
Like there's like some area of your personality that subconsciously needed to

254
00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:08.650
get expressed.
And so what it's done is it's created a character.
Sure.

255
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:11.710
It's going to guide you.
I mean,
I don't know.
Look,
that's the,

256
00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:14.500
that that's absolutely possible.
And I'm not playing devil's advocate.

257
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.500
I just really don't know.
I'm,
I certainly,

258
00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:21.490
it certainly has felt like when I've had DMT experiences that it was wasn't in

259
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:22.840
the same places I am now.

260
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:27.870
I felt like I was in a new world and I definitely also was kinda tweaked by the

261
00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:32.290
fact that I was myself.
I wasn't drunk,
I wasn't and I wasn't,

262
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:34.000
I wasn't myself tripping balls.

263
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.630
I was myself seeing something that was impossible.
Yeah.

264
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.750
It's a weird thing how that experience hits you where it doesn't change your own

265
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:46.540
personal fee,
the way you feel physically,
the way your mind works.

266
00:14:46.541 --> 00:14:50.800
It doesn't change that.
It just explodes.
It seems like a doorway,

267
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.590
but I don't know what the fuck is really going on.
That's,
it's interesting.
Yeah.

268
00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:57.230
So I'll tell the story of how I encountered these beings and then we'll,

269
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.300
we'll try and figure it out.
Cause I had a lively debate.

270
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:01.940
I was actually down there with my friend Bodie and we had a lively debate.

271
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:06.020
He was on the camp that it was just,
you know,
parts of my own mind for me,

272
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:06.890
I wasn't quite sure.

273
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:11.300
It seemed like there's something there or to be confident in either or as silly.

274
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.920
Yeah,
exactly.
How consciousness is created by chemicals.
Okay.

275
00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:19.640
You need all these different chemicals in order for a human being to have a mine

276
00:15:19.641 --> 00:15:24.320
that's functioning and this consciousness of the human mind has manifested a

277
00:15:24.321 --> 00:15:28.790
physical reality that is almost impossible to imagine me think of airplanes and

278
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:31.880
the Internet and television and fucking giant buildings and shit.

279
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.620
These are all come from chemicals.

280
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:38.420
Chemicals have produced chain reactions.
They've produced,

281
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:43.390
they've set into motion a chain of events that have fucking eaten.

282
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.030
Every fish out of the ocean polluted everything,
you know,

283
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.500
figured out how to drop bombs that incinerate a half a million people at a time.

284
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.840
I mean,
this is all come from chemicals.

285
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.380
So why would we be tripped out that the idea that you introduce a different

286
00:15:57.381 --> 00:15:59.960
chemical and you literally change dimensions.
Yeah,

287
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:04.640
I mean the chemicals in this dimension of change the shit out of this place,

288
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.510
you know,

289
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:09.260
and that has done it in the form and the manifestation of human consciousness.

290
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.040
Why wouldn't we think that another one that you add to human consciousness might

291
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.850
elevate you to some different place.

292
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.200
And that's what I think the real shame about all the,

293
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:21.410
the drug laws that disallow these different explorations.
Because you know,

294
00:16:21.411 --> 00:16:24.860
at this point it's just such as still such a small amount of people that are

295
00:16:24.861 --> 00:16:27.500
accessing this that are able to research it.
I mean,

296
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.240
the Lebron James of psychedelic tripping has not been discovered yet.
You know,

297
00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:35.360
like,
he's like the person who can go go out there and pick up information that's

298
00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:38.600
completely different and bring it back and solve some of these mysteries.

299
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.660
It's just,
you know,
you got to have a basketball court on every bra,

300
00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.680
every block to produce the bond James and you gotta have psychedelics legal,

301
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:49.070
you know,
to get enough of people to get the super,
you know,

302
00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:52.880
the super explorer out there and have access to it.
Yeah.

303
00:16:52.881 --> 00:16:56.180
And I think also collectively we learn from each other's experiences.

304
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.250
I know that,
you know,

305
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.950
when I have had friends that have tripped and came back and had a different

306
00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:02.620
perspective on themselves,
you know,

307
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.620
just absorbing their story and absorbing their experience.

308
00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:10.770
And then you have your experience compounded with the information that they kind

309
00:17:10.771 --> 00:17:12.200
of gave you about their experience.

310
00:17:12.201 --> 00:17:16.550
And it all builds up together when you're just by yourself alone and a fucking

311
00:17:16.551 --> 00:17:20.390
cabin in Vermont and your trip and your fucking balls off with nobody to talk
to,

312
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.040
you know,
it's like,
did you meet,
what was that movie,
uh,
into the wild?

313
00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:29.840
Is that what it was?
When the kid goes up to Alaska and,
uh,
one of his,

314
00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:32.870
uh,
one of his big things as he realizes,
he,

315
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:37.900
he can't have fun unless he is with other people.

316
00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:42.410
Like you're not,
you,
you can't enjoy your life unless you were the other people.

317
00:17:42.411 --> 00:17:45.640
Like the idea of going on here,
social creature,

318
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.100
you can't just be in Alaska and go this so beautiful going to be so happy.

319
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.960
<v 3>You know,
you where is,
where is everybody?</v>

320
00:17:51.961 --> 00:17:54.870
It doesn't matter how many flashlights you have,
it's still not going to be fun.

321
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.030
Yeah,
there's a show that I've been watching lately.

322
00:17:57.031 --> 00:18:00.780
It's called the mountain men and this is false.
Three different dudes,

323
00:18:00.781 --> 00:18:05.310
one in Alaska,
one in Montana and one in North Carolina.
And the guy in Alaska,

324
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.220
man,
this motherfucker is a trip.

325
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:13.250
This guy gets in a little float plane and he takes off and he fell.

326
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.320
He flies three hours into the woods where there's no one and he gets there and

327
00:18:19.561 --> 00:18:24.000
goes to his cabin and when he goes to his cabin and then he asked to take piece

328
00:18:24.001 --> 00:18:27.300
by piece his snowmobile,
I said take the parts out and put them back together.

329
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:27.571
By the way,

330
00:18:27.571 --> 00:18:32.520
it's 30 below zero as to put the parts back in the daytime as to put the parts

331
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.940
on a snow machine together.
If there are then a,

332
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.450
he kind of got my time and you hear that and then he drives 24 miles on a

333
00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:40.320
snowmobile,

334
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.100
24 miles to check is a string of traps and that's what he does every day.

335
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:49.310
He did it every day for months and he made $4,000 $4,000 for doing like the

336
00:18:52.111 --> 00:18:55.040
hardest shit you've ever seen in your life.
This guy is,
first of all,
he's,

337
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.770
he's trails will disappear because the snow will hit so fast.

338
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.260
By the time we tried to turn around and drive the trail back,

339
00:19:01.261 --> 00:19:02.670
you can't see what the fuck is going on.

340
00:19:02.671 --> 00:19:06.660
So he hits logs and breaks his skis and he's like,
if you get hurt out here,

341
00:19:06.661 --> 00:19:07.770
you're fucked.
Like you know,

342
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:12.771
really your f three hours by plane into Alaska,

343
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.050
there's no one there,
no one.

344
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.420
And this fucking guy is driving around killing animals with these springy metal

345
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:22.440
contraptions.

346
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.430
It's snap their heads in and they'd takes their skins and sells them.

347
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.930
It's a hard man.
Meanwhile the dude's seems happy as fuck.

348
00:19:30.931 --> 00:19:33.840
That's the crazy thing about it.
The guy seems so happy.

349
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.390
He seems like he's having a great time.
And,
you know,

350
00:19:36.391 --> 00:19:39.140
we were talking earlier about people who are on antidepressants,

351
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.660
like what number of people are on antidepressants and how weird it is when

352
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:46.140
you're around someone is loopy on antidepressants and you're like,

353
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:51.170
I wonder how much of our brain is just fucking designed to be a hunter and

354
00:19:52.231 --> 00:19:55.200
gatherer.
And despite the fact that we've evolved way,

355
00:19:55.201 --> 00:19:59.640
way past that societaly the physical bodies slowish shit to catch up to

356
00:19:59.641 --> 00:20:00.810
technology.
Yeah,
for sure.

357
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.500
I read a book by Bertrand Russell called Conquest that happiness and here's a

358
00:20:04.501 --> 00:20:09.360
preeminent kinda 19th or 20th century philosopher and a in that book he

359
00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:12.540
describes like a gardener that they had and hit and Ms. Gardner,

360
00:20:12.541 --> 00:20:15.540
he said was one of the examples of the happiest people he's ever seen.

361
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.080
And he lived in a very affluent kind of British society.
Um,

362
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.280
and he said one of the reasons his keys to happiness was every day he went out

363
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:27.090
and he,
his job was to hunt rabbits cause the rabbits would tear up the gardens.

364
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.090
So that was his daily challenge that he got to do.

365
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.000
And he was had like every morning he woke up and he was like,

366
00:20:33.001 --> 00:20:35.850
I was goddamn rabbits,
I'm going to fucking get them,
you know?

367
00:20:35.851 --> 00:20:40.470
And that was that for him was all he needed to everyday have that challenge and

368
00:20:40.471 --> 00:20:43.350
have the ability to meet it and feel like he was making a difference.

369
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.440
That's what made him happy.
So similar to your mountain man,
you know,

370
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.130
he goes out and he goes after

371
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.950
<v 2>those animals and he has that challenge against nature,</v>

372
00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:54.070
challenge the catch the animals and then come back and get it.

373
00:20:54.071 --> 00:20:55.240
And I think that makes them happy.

374
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:58.840
But these people who have these jobs that feel like they are completely

375
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:01.780
meaningless.
Like what are you doing?
What are you creating?
It's monotonous.

376
00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:05.290
It's the same day.
It's not a challenge anymore.
You're just clocking in.
Yeah.

377
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.870
I think that makes it even more,
more difficult to maintain happiness.

378
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.130
<v 3>Well,
everybody can't have the perfect life,</v>

379
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.350
unfortunately for society to work like this,

380
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.440
the only way to have a gigantic society,

381
00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:22.330
the way we have here is there's a lot of people have to do shit that sucks.
Yeah.

382
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:26.350
They,
they have to,
and you get talked into thinking that,
you know,

383
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:29.440
you're going to get out of college all I needed to just get a good job and

384
00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:32.290
you're going to be fine.
No,
no,
you're not going to be fine.

385
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.150
You're not going to be fine for eight hours.

386
00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:37.540
You're going to be in pain every day.
It's not a lot of pain,

387
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.070
but it's a mild pain.

388
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:43.360
It's the kind of pain that makes you shoot up a post office and do absorb it for

389
00:21:43.361 --> 00:21:46.480
30 years.
That's what it is.
It's just mild pain.

390
00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.300
<v 2>Especially when you make the releases illegal.
You know?</v>

391
00:21:49.301 --> 00:21:51.670
I really think if you're going to be in that kind of situation,

392
00:21:51.671 --> 00:21:53.650
there's a lot of people that are,
well if you do,

393
00:21:53.651 --> 00:21:56.980
you better get out and fucking camp on the weekends and go find nature again.

394
00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:59.470
Cause that's part of what I think is another key.

395
00:21:59.471 --> 00:22:02.650
It probably why your mountain madness so happy cause he's connecting with the

396
00:22:02.651 --> 00:22:04.630
natural world,
which I think is another big key.

397
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:08.380
So you better go out and fucking camp on the weekends and every six to 12
months,

398
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.970
you know,
I believe that a psychedelic reset can be extremely valuable,

399
00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:17.200
can kind of purge all of these kind of negative emotions that you felt and then

400
00:22:17.201 --> 00:22:20.560
you can kind of go do your job and checkout and live for other things.

401
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:24.310
If your girlfriend for your workout that you have at the end of that fucking job

402
00:22:24.311 --> 00:22:28.730
or bust your ass Pressfield's turning pro or worry about it,

403
00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.520
get the fuck out.
That's my ocean.

404
00:22:30.521 --> 00:22:32.830
Towns are so happy every time you go to the ocean town.

405
00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:35.930
Like it's always happy and positive and people are ha,
you know,
like,

406
00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.640
because they're humbled by nature every day.

407
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.310
<v 3>You're humbled by nature.
Yeah,
I agree with that.
I did.</v>

408
00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.500
Mountain towns are like that too.
Yeah.
They're,

409
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.170
they're nice people because they're humble.
They're humbled by nature.

410
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:50.380
It's a different kind of humbling the mountain towns cause it's a cold weather

411
00:22:50.381 --> 00:22:53.410
sort of button down the hatches.
Do you guys need help changing your flat?

412
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.200
You know,
it's like that kind of happy.
But,
uh,
the,

413
00:22:56.250 --> 00:23:00.490
the ocean towns are always like laid back cause like you just look out of that

414
00:23:00.491 --> 00:23:04.610
ocean and go shut up bitch.
I can't,
nothing be important.
Look at this,

415
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.840
this crazy puddle of water we're in front of.

416
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.650
<v 2>Yeah.
I tell you man in San Diego I was there for comic cons and you were also,</v>

417
00:23:10.651 --> 00:23:13.680
it's so beautiful.
Like I did that one bridge,

418
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:18.030
that humongous bridge that kind of goes around where it's just super high up.

419
00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.840
It's blue water.
San Diego Shits on La,

420
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:25.470
get those negative ions off the water.
It's,
we had the weed.

421
00:23:25.471 --> 00:23:30.471
I you do feel that that marijuana laws or at least it's tolerance is completely

422
00:23:30.961 --> 00:23:33.510
different than what it is in Los Angeles.
They have,

423
00:23:33.511 --> 00:23:35.550
they have a really hard time putting up dispensary's there.

424
00:23:35.551 --> 00:23:37.350
They keep getting shut down and then like,

425
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.280
like the people that worked the doors are all ex military guys so they enforce

426
00:23:41.281 --> 00:23:44.130
it more.
You know,
it's like you can see how it just spreads.

427
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.950
Like we could barely find a place to smoke

428
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.130
<v 0>a joint in San Diego near a comedy club.
You know,</v>

429
00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.610
at first we were like trying to go on the sidewalks and we got kicked off

430
00:23:52.611 --> 00:23:54.560
torches and yeah,

431
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.100
it's a lot trickier than it isn't La la so ridiculous right now.

432
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.980
It's like the folks who live in other parts of the world,

433
00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:05.930
you don't realize how suppressed you are.
You come to La and I mean,

434
00:24:05.931 --> 00:24:07.790
and they keep talking about clothes and places down.

435
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:10.430
They did target after the big places.
That's what they do.

436
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.630
They target after places like Oaksterdam.
There's another place.
And,

437
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.940
and the good thing about these big places as those guys generate enough money to

438
00:24:16.941 --> 00:24:20.210
fight it in court.
And so hopefully some,
some good will come out of it.

439
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.810
But you have no idea how many there are.
You have no idea.

440
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:28.990
There's way more than there are Starbucks and Mcdonald's combined.

441
00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.760
And when you hear the shit with the raids and stuff,
it's,

442
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:36.200
if you look at the shit like the why they got raided cause they were operating

443
00:24:36.201 --> 00:24:37.520
without a license,
you know,
they weren't

444
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.590
many places that are just breaking the laws.
No,
no,
no.

445
00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:45.540
What's that last one Tommy Chong said is right there.

446
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:50.560
The one in Long Beach where they,
the cops stepped on the kids and those,

447
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.170
fuck yeah,
they didn't have a license and the guys,
but the big ones,

448
00:24:54.171 --> 00:24:57.170
they're getting,
the DEA is going after them because they have a lot of cash.

449
00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.300
That's one thing.
They're stealing their money.

450
00:24:59.301 --> 00:25:02.210
They're going after when they take their pot and their money and you know,

451
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.780
good luck getting neither one of them back and a year later your pots not worth

452
00:25:05.781 --> 00:25:09.170
anything anyway.
Stupid.
You know,
at the time you go through the legal bullshit.

453
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.190
Yeah.
Here's your pot.
By the way.
Most of it's probably already smoked.

454
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.940
He ate probably smoke this shit out of your fucking weed.
They resold it,

455
00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:19.910
required it.
Well,

456
00:25:19.911 --> 00:25:23.810
Obama said that he was only going to go after people that weren't violating
that.

457
00:25:23.811 --> 00:25:27.680
We're violating both state and federal law.
That's what they said at first.

458
00:25:27.681 --> 00:25:31.290
But they have a sense not,
they've not lived up to that cause a,

459
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:36.260
that Oaksterdam place wasn't violating state law.
They're just,
you know,
it's a,

460
00:25:36.261 --> 00:25:37.190
it's a fucking,

461
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.090
they got to keep busy and it's an easy way to rescue people and not get shot.

462
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:46.150
You know,
go try and raid the meth lab with such confidence.
You know,
go try it.

463
00:25:46.151 --> 00:25:48.590
Yeah.
Yeah.
You step into a fucking meth lab,
dude,

464
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:52.700
you might get shanked there might be a dude hanging by his heels from the

465
00:25:52.701 --> 00:25:56.440
ceiling ready to drop on a cop cause he's like,
that's what he does.

466
00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.510
Cause it's a method out all day and he's got a knife in his teeth.
Yeah.

467
00:25:59.511 --> 00:26:02.450
You don't want to do that.
Kick in in a math lab is dangerous.

468
00:26:02.451 --> 00:26:04.760
They'll throw a grenade at you and blow it up right in front of them.

469
00:26:04.761 --> 00:26:08.150
They're fucking meltdown.
They don't know what they're doing.
The cops,

470
00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.120
when they go and break out a,
a medical marijuana store,

471
00:26:11.121 --> 00:26:14.260
it's like you might as well be arresting babies,
you know?

472
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.610
And then when he's fighting back,
you know,

473
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.490
meanwhile comps are smashed and the cameras and shit,

474
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.940
the whole thing's disgusting.
If this was a cvs pharmacy,

475
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.660
they get right down the street.
You would never think about doing that.
Meanwhile,

476
00:26:26.661 --> 00:26:31.130
those mother fuckers are dispensing Oxycontin's on the regular people are coming

477
00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:36.131
in every day that are stone cold opiate junkies and cvs is just keeping them

478
00:26:37.071 --> 00:26:41.300
alive,
keeping them alive and giving them bottles of pills.

479
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.160
And some of them they smashed snort

480
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.980
<v 3>and some of them may smoke and some of them they just take.</v>

481
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.170
And meanwhile the medical marijuana place get on the ground.
Yeah.
Plants.

482
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:52.860
Do you guys have flowers?

483
00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.650
<v 2>I think the biggest problem is the reason why it's not already legal is you</v>

484
00:26:56.651 --> 00:26:59.320
can't patent pot.
It's just too easy to grow.

485
00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.500
Too many show could do it so they can't control it and they can't monetize it.

486
00:27:02.501 --> 00:27:05.830
The corporations can't do it.
There's the APP for sure.
For sure.
I mean,

487
00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.150
there's no other,

488
00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.300
you have to follow the money and all of these cases and there's just no other

489
00:27:10.301 --> 00:27:14.170
good reason.
Except I guess in some cases like at Boga and Iowasca.
I mean,

490
00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:17.650
nobody's going to do that shit for fun.
I mean,
it sucks.
You're puking,

491
00:27:17.651 --> 00:27:21.100
you're shitting,
you're like,
it's,
um,
it's a tough tomato.

492
00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.460
Not everyone's growing tomatoes.
And it's true.

493
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:28.780
<v 3>Even easy.
Yeah.
Even easy shit like tomatoes and I said it's fast.
Awesome.</v>

494
00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.830
Yeah.
Celery,
grow some bamboo.
Grow your own bamboo.

495
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.430
Bamboo grows like fucking an inch a day.
It's constantly growing.

496
00:27:36.431 --> 00:27:39.630
It grows fast as shit.
Nobody's growing it.
Just make it cheaper.
You know?

497
00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.370
It'd be like being able to buy a pound for five bucks.
Well,

498
00:27:42.371 --> 00:27:47.371
the idea that you could be growing like lettuce and I can come along and say,

499
00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:51.400
you can't grow lettuce.
If there was only two of us,
that would be so ridiculous.

500
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.550
You're like,
what the fuck are you talking about?
Get get away from me.

501
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.350
I'm growing some lettuce.
There's only two of us.
It would be,

502
00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.460
but if there's 300 million of us,

503
00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:03.910
you can come up to me and say you can't grow marijuana.
I'd be like,

504
00:28:03.911 --> 00:28:07.750
what are you talking about?
Why are you telling me what to do ever?
Well,

505
00:28:07.751 --> 00:28:11.220
you only reason why it's seems like you should be allowed to tell somebody who

506
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:12.520
would do is when there's,

507
00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.350
you represent some giant group of people,
like there's a bunch.

508
00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:20.980
And so there's bunch has decided they don't like you doing this and they haven't

509
00:28:20.981 --> 00:28:22.930
even decided to by the way,
you know,

510
00:28:22.931 --> 00:28:27.931
it's like what it is is a bunch of a giant group of people who are making money

511
00:28:28.811 --> 00:28:33.130
from other things and are worried that you're going to take away some of their

512
00:28:33.131 --> 00:28:35.590
profits with this plant that you want to grow.

513
00:28:35.591 --> 00:28:39.280
So they go and they pay off the cops and they,
they literally do,

514
00:28:39.281 --> 00:28:43.330
they give them money and then they give politicians money.
They give it to them,

515
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.530
they give them millions of dollars and they say,
we want to make sure that this,

516
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.030
this position is supported.

517
00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:53.020
And so they go out and they bust pot shops.

518
00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:55.870
I mean it's really that us and not,
and even as crazy

519
00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.250
<v 2>male species of hemp,
you know,
we can't grow that.</v>

520
00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:02.080
I can't even say I have to source our hat for this new protein that we got from,

521
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.943
from Canada.

522
00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.720
And it comes in just the male species and it's so easy to grow sustainable for

523
00:29:07.721 --> 00:29:09.610
the soil.
You don't need pesticides.

524
00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:13.720
The protein it produces is one of the most nutritious protein for you at all the

525
00:29:13.721 --> 00:29:17.710
fibers you can use for clothes.
I mean,
and it's illegal.
The fucking car,

526
00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:22.550
<v 3>it's inquiry and it doesn't even fucking,
it's not even psychoactive at all.
No.</v>

527
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:27.640
It's illegal to grow a plant that doesn't even get you high because it's related

528
00:29:28.371 --> 00:29:29.204
to a planting.

529
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.310
<v 2>That's food.
It's going to be even,
I mean,
you know God for,</v>

530
00:29:32.311 --> 00:29:35.880
God forbid there's some kind of hunger issue that comes from any kind of

531
00:29:35.881 --> 00:29:36.900
collapse or something like that,

532
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:40.500
but then you got a plant that's about the easiest motherfucker to grow that can

533
00:29:40.501 --> 00:29:42.130
feed people and clothe people

534
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.240
<v 4>and you're like,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You did not want that because why?
Well,</v>

535
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.400
because it's sister makes people,

536
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:54.050
makes people happy while they're selling oxycontin's by the truck load.

537
00:29:54.051 --> 00:29:54.430
Yeah.

538
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:59.430
They got truck mom passing each other on the highway filled with oxies.

539
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:04.090
Wow.
Wow.
Everywhere you go oxies actually,
what do you got there?

540
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.630
Nothing just from pharmaceuticals and bringing a cvs.
You're up.
Go on your way.

541
00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.990
Yeah,
I always thought it was that.
A roach in your fucking ashtray,
boy,

542
00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.140
you know they'll pull you out and beat you if you have a roach in your ashtray.

543
00:30:14.141 --> 00:30:16.330
But they'll,
they'll look at your papers and go,
what do you got?

544
00:30:16.331 --> 00:30:18.940
Enough oxygen cotton in there to kill a fucking country.

545
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.250
I always thought it would be a good,

546
00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:26.230
a good skit by some enterprising pioneer to take a cop out to a cow pasture and

547
00:30:26.231 --> 00:30:30.010
find like a magic mushroom that's growing in the cow pasture and walk with the

548
00:30:30.011 --> 00:30:34.270
cop and it just find the exact point where it becomes illegal to touch something

549
00:30:34.271 --> 00:30:36.670
that's growing out of the ground.
You know,
just bring them,

550
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.700
come up to it and come close to it and it's this.
Okay.

551
00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:43.910
And then just touch it with if you cluck it.
Am I,
do I own this now?
Yeah,

552
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.560
I PR and now I'm a prisoner.
Can you pet it?
I mean when,

553
00:30:47.561 --> 00:30:50.530
at what point does he smack you in the face and handcuff you?

554
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:52.150
If you'd pick it up by the Turd.

555
00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.400
I'm not even touching it.
I've got a shovel.
Right.
Shoveling the Turd.
I mean,

556
00:31:00.401 --> 00:31:03.880
just to find,
I mean it gets so absurd at that point,
you know,

557
00:31:03.881 --> 00:31:06.850
when this natural substance becomes illegal,

558
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:10.300
they were legal in England for into really,
really recently.

559
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:14.580
But it's probably because Americans went there and took too many mushrooms to

560
00:31:14.581 --> 00:31:16.510
freak the fuck out and ran on the streets.
Like,
all right,

561
00:31:16.511 --> 00:31:21.470
we got to stop this shit.
Maybe or they just had too many good ideas.
Yeah.

562
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:24.970
Hope.
Well hopefully that was the reason.
But I guess,
you know,
there is some,

563
00:31:24.971 --> 00:31:26.740
there's the two promising fields.

564
00:31:26.741 --> 00:31:29.410
There's some pretty good research coming at Johns Hopkins had that one on

565
00:31:29.411 --> 00:31:32.170
suicide and that was good.
Maps is doing some good work.

566
00:31:32.171 --> 00:31:34.680
Some other people are doing good work,
but then the,
uh,

567
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:39.340
the Church of Santa Di may want a big case,
um,
for,
uh,

568
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.970
I Wasa as a medical,
I mean as a religious sacrament.

569
00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:47.200
So that's kind of another angle that's kind of allowing some of these medicines,

570
00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.600
um,
to get in through a loophole cause you're allowed.

571
00:31:49.601 --> 00:31:52.180
And I know the native American church already got Payoti approved.

572
00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.180
And then this Church of Santa diamond or either them or the EDV,
I dunno,

573
00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.250
they're both thinking about that.
EDV Yeah,
both are trying.

574
00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:04.750
I think one succeeded ones in the works,
but it's vegetal.
How does the EDV,

575
00:32:04.751 --> 00:32:07.990
what does he bowser breakdown something that vegetal or something like that?

576
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:08.440
Yeah.

577
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.430
Well for folks who don't know what these are is they're Christian groups that

578
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.270
are from Brazil and they combine,
uh,

579
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.520
Christianity with Iowasca.
It's,

580
00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:21.430
it's a very strange sort of offshoot of religion.

581
00:32:21.431 --> 00:32:26.431
They take really high level psychedelic drugs and they sing songs about Jesus.

582
00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:32.430
I have a friend who went and said it is crazy.
Yeah.
He said that was a,

583
00:32:32.431 --> 00:32:35.920
there was a showman down in the area that we were at.
Who does that?
Who combines,

584
00:32:35.921 --> 00:32:40.250
who blends,
you know,
Christianity with the jungle beliefs

585
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:44.300
<v 0>of Iowasca.
So the beings that he's talking to sometimes,
you know,
it's um,</v>

586
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.111
you know,

587
00:32:45.111 --> 00:32:49.100
spirit of mother Iowasca or whatever and other times it's straight sweet baby

588
00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:49.950
Jesus that he's,

589
00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.580
that he's trying to talk to and that actually throws some people off.

590
00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:57.500
I definitely prefer my,
my job and to be straight straight jungle beliefs.

591
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.210
That really begs the question then,
what's going on?

592
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.650
What's going on?
Is,

593
00:33:03.651 --> 00:33:08.651
is Jesus real or is everything you can imagine real and is your imagination

594
00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.470
concocting all this shit.

595
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:17.770
And is the imagination sort of being underestimated or downplayed or um,

596
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.240
maybe mischaracterized.
You know,

597
00:33:20.241 --> 00:33:23.230
we look at the imagination as something that creates some bullshit.

598
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.570
Something that's not real.
Something that the cranes,
things that are imaginary,

599
00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:28.940
you're making it up.
They don't exist.

600
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.850
But maybe it's much more complicated than that.

601
00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:36.050
Maybe their imagination is a reality.

602
00:33:36.051 --> 00:33:39.310
Creating frequency.
Maybe it's a,
you know,

603
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:42.000
maybe it's something that actually does mean from out of the,

604
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.450
out of the imagination comes everything.
Right?
It's true.

605
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:48.710
There's fucking computer didn't exist until somebody imagined it and then made

606
00:33:48.711 --> 00:33:53.450
it.
So it's that.
It also could be that these,
these are really archetypal forces.

607
00:33:53.451 --> 00:33:57.530
So like if you're talking about,
you know,
St George or Saint Michael or Jesus,

608
00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.010
you know,

609
00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:02.570
you're just basically giving a name to a spiritual force that has certain

610
00:34:02.571 --> 00:34:07.460
characteristics,
but you're also giving them a name and giving them a face.

611
00:34:07.461 --> 00:34:09.350
Yeah,
yeah.
But it's all part of the thing there.

612
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:12.380
I think it might be all part of the translation mechanism.
You know,

613
00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:16.790
it's communicating to you in a way that makes the most sense to you.
You know,

614
00:34:16.791 --> 00:34:17.750
but so let me,

615
00:34:17.751 --> 00:34:20.540
let me get into the full store cause I've had some encounters with some
entities.

616
00:34:20.541 --> 00:34:21.250
Brian,
do you have the,

617
00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:24.920
you have the music might be kind of cool to cue this up so you can get a taste

618
00:34:24.921 --> 00:34:29.300
of what I was hearing as I was going through this.
Uh,
and this is called,

619
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:30.403
what are they called?

620
00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.351
<v 4>He could also,</v>

621
00:34:32.351 --> 00:34:36.090
and these are passed down grandfather to grandson and their songs that they sing

622
00:34:36.091 --> 00:34:39.810
while the Io Oscar ceremonies going on and they take the Iowasca with you.

623
00:34:39.811 --> 00:34:43.860
So they learn these songs while on our Alaska and they sing the songs while on I

624
00:34:43.861 --> 00:34:47.190
lost SCA and also smoking the nicotine.
I rooster Tika cigarettes,

625
00:34:47.191 --> 00:34:51.060
which is the different type of tobacco,
you know,
wine is tobacco.
Um,

626
00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:54.390
play a part in it.
Like the blow tobacco on your face.
Yeah.

627
00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:56.670
That's kind of a cleansing ritual,
but tobacco apart.

628
00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:00.720
But I think it also has some effect on opening up the reactors in your brain.

629
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:06.000
So it kind of activates the IOWASCA experience.
I think the,
I don't know,

630
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.430
I could do a little bit more research on the science behind it,

631
00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:13.290
but I think the nicotine has some similar effect to the DMT reactors.
Well,

632
00:35:13.291 --> 00:35:18.291
it's amazing how many people are missing misinformed about nicotine.

633
00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.120
Nicotine actually is good for you.
Yeah.

634
00:35:21.121 --> 00:35:23.710
Like nicotine is healthy for people have bad heart.
It's like,

635
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.890
it's like you could use it as a medication in some circumstances.

636
00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:30.820
It's just smoking it with like 590 other chemicals.

637
00:35:30.821 --> 00:35:34.150
It's not so fucking fantastic smoking a period

638
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.550
when you're getting a bundle out of the jungle.
I think it's a little different.

639
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.690
Yeah.
And cigars are different too.
So anyway,

640
00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:47.700
this guy's singing this thing.
Yeah,
he's tripping.
Balls are,
so this is,

641
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.790
this is this the first time I had kind of a real physical purge,

642
00:35:50.791 --> 00:35:53.400
not too much to talk about.
I was nauseous the whole time.

643
00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:56.940
I was puking and shitting and it was more about my body getting prepared for the

644
00:35:56.941 --> 00:35:57.691
second session.

645
00:35:57.691 --> 00:36:02.340
So the second session I doubled up on the cups and it's about an hour and a half

646
00:36:02.341 --> 00:36:04.500
in and listening does,

647
00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:07.050
you're basically hearing what I'm hearing at this point in time.

648
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:11.400
The shamans kind of rattling his leaves and singing his songs and uh,

649
00:36:11.401 --> 00:36:14.900
and then the experience starts to get rich like it did,
you know,

650
00:36:14.901 --> 00:36:19.470
at the time before and what appears to me is like a nexus of energy right in

651
00:36:19.471 --> 00:36:22.270
front of me.
And unlike last time where things were coming at me,

652
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:25.200
snakes and eels were just charging at me from all directions.

653
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.790
This time it was subtler.

654
00:36:26.791 --> 00:36:29.940
I felt like I was looking into like a black hole or wormhole.

655
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:35.130
What does that sound?
The whistling?
No,
the,
the background,

656
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.870
that's the,
uh,
I dunno,
the cricket tie.
That's the ink techs and the Johns,

657
00:36:39.871 --> 00:36:42.090
the insects and the jungle.
We're outside in the jungle.
Yeah.

658
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:47.020
I mean this is the real jungle dude.
Just that alone.
Yeah.
No,

659
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.860
it's true.
It'll get me,
somebody got to rattle and I'm like,
what is that?

660
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.280
Is that a rattle and no,
that's insane.
Yeah.
So it'll,

661
00:36:52.281 --> 00:36:56.950
Ohio sounds like it at night.
I don't think Ohio,
so I was quite like the joggers.

662
00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:00.990
No,
those insects.
I'm sure there are some insects in Ohio.

663
00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.910
There's some insects out here at night too,
but not so much here.

664
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:08.160
I'm on an MP three player,
like Oh yeah.
Oh yeah,
totally.
Really?
Yeah,
100%.

665
00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:14.090
Maybe the,
I dunno if it'll catch something scary or about the jungle,

666
00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:19.250
jaguars and monkeys and all snakes or anything like that.
No,
we did see,
uh,

667
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.980
we did see a taper though as we're going through,
which is pretty cool.
Oh yeah.

668
00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.530
Well it was little.
I need your guys.
But anyway,
so I,

669
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:30.510
it appears to me as like a nexus and it's nothing much has happened to phone.

670
00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:35.730
Is there an x,
a little phone?
No,
but it's like a vortex,
let's say like a vortex.

671
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:38.550
And it's kind of swirled with some different colors,
purple,

672
00:37:38.551 --> 00:37:41.310
and it's just kind of waiting there for me.
So I was like,
well,

673
00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:44.850
I guess maybe I should ask something to come through it because nothing really

674
00:37:44.851 --> 00:37:48.810
was happening.
So I'm looking at,
I was like,
hi,
I'd like to be,
you know,

675
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:52.050
if anything's out there on the other side,
you know,
please come to me.

676
00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:56.160
And I say that to myself and my head and then bursting through it comes these

677
00:37:56.161 --> 00:37:57.330
huge dragon,

678
00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.920
like this giant 10 is the dragon head was just 10 feet right in front of me.

679
00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:04.890
And it was a silver dragon in the kind of medieval stylings.

680
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:08.820
And it had fluorescent green and blue highlights and smoke was coming out of his

681
00:38:08.821 --> 00:38:13.740
nose and he was like,
clearly a fire breathing dragon.
And he goes,

682
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:18.630
he comes right up to me and he goes,
uh,
so you want to change the world?

683
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:23.760
And I go,
yes.
And he goes,
why?

684
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:26.820
And he's like flaming,
coming out of his mouth.
And I was like,

685
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:31.620
cause that's what I'm here for.
And he goes,
law,
ah,
ah,
ah,

686
00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:35.890
and laughs and for whatever reason I decided to take them like neverending story

687
00:38:35.891 --> 00:38:39.910
and I just hopped on his back.
Yeah.
So I hopped on,

688
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.930
I hopped on his back and uh,
and he starts cruising,
you know,

689
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.210
and we're kind of cruising through and he goes,

690
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:50.680
so why do you want to change the world?
This seems like a kid's movie.

691
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:55.380
I know you guys.
Right?
It was fully never ending story.
And I go,
I go,
uh,

692
00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:00.250
to help people.
And then I thought that was a pretty good answer.
And he goes,

693
00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.140
are you sure?

694
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.010
And then right there he like shows me a cross section of my life and all my

695
00:39:06.011 --> 00:39:06.670
actions.

696
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:10.510
And what he showed me was that even though ostensibly I do a lot of things to

697
00:39:10.511 --> 00:39:14.410
help people is always,
always a serious component of propping myself up,

698
00:39:14.411 --> 00:39:15.191
my own ego,

699
00:39:15.191 --> 00:39:20.191
my own persona and my own kind of establishing my own self in the world.

700
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.140
For,
you know,
egoistic and pride reasons.

701
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.350
And he just showed me this like lucidly clear,
you know,

702
00:39:26.351 --> 00:39:29.050
that there was a mixture of,
of my actions,
you know,

703
00:39:29.051 --> 00:39:30.680
and he wanted to mess with all of us.
Yeah.

704
00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:35.740
And he wanted to have me be aware that of where that boundary line lie and not

705
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:39.030
to trick myself for confused myself and thinking that,
you know,

706
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.730
what I was doing wasn't also for my own benefit.
That was like,

707
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:47.850
all right,
dragon egg,
like one point for you.
And then he's,
so we're,

708
00:39:47.851 --> 00:39:51.370
we're cruising so there were keep crews in and he starts to really get heated in

709
00:39:51.371 --> 00:39:54.250
the mouth.
Like flame was trickling out and he goes,
it was a,

710
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:57.890
what do you want to destroy?
And he likes swoops down and I was,

711
00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:01.900
I was sure he was ready,
just fuck some shit up.
So I was like,
ignorance.

712
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:04.930
And I thought he was just going to lay the ground with fire,
you know,

713
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:09.880
and instead he goes,
should not be what you want to heal.
And I was like,

714
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.670
Yup,
I guess you're right dragon.

715
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:17.050
So he was really like challenging me in these answers that I gave him,

716
00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:22.000
which was a pretty interesting kind of experience,
you know,
for,

717
00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:25.120
for this other entity to be clearly,
you know,

718
00:40:25.121 --> 00:40:29.530
showing me different sides and teaching me things that I clearly wasn't quite

719
00:40:29.531 --> 00:40:30.160
aware of.

720
00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.950
Maybe you were maybe somewhere in the back of your head we're aware of,
you know,

721
00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:39.610
your shortcomings are not even,
not even shortcomings,
just slight bullshitting.

722
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:43.540
Yeah,
exactly.
No,
we wanted to just carve away all that nonsense and then,

723
00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.220
and then show me the rest.
So the Dragon,

724
00:40:45.221 --> 00:40:48.580
I was still on his back and he drops me off in the woods.
Right.

725
00:40:48.581 --> 00:40:52.120
So he drops me off in the woods and I,
and I'm walking through the woods.
Okay,

726
00:40:52.121 --> 00:40:56.890
so you laid him in.
How did you get to the woods though?
I'm on the Dragon's back.

727
00:40:56.891 --> 00:40:59.950
Full neverending story.
Imagine the nobody even really in the woods,

728
00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.800
you really in the women,
the jungle,
but whatever that is,

729
00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:04.450
you really get there though.
I mean,

730
00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:09.130
you really didn't fly around in a fucking dragon,
did you?
Well,
in my mind I did.

731
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:13.330
You just kind of not a dragon and then all of a sudden he drops me off and I hop

732
00:41:13.331 --> 00:41:13.601
off.

733
00:41:13.601 --> 00:41:18.340
I don't know the details of how I got off the dragon into the woods or under

734
00:41:18.341 --> 00:41:21.190
what was really going on while you,
what would I have seen?

735
00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:24.840
Are you on a dragon now?
Drag it,
drag it.

736
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:29.990
Like what would a a wonder what I would see if I saw you doing that?

737
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:33.280
Would you just be walking and I'll be good.
What are you doing?
Sitting,

738
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.830
drag you down with me so much about myself.
Like a fucking dragon.

739
00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.350
Are you talking about man?
Yeah,
exactly.
So anyway,

740
00:41:39.351 --> 00:41:44.030
so I dismount from the dragon somehow and I'm in the woods and I see a bear and

741
00:41:44.031 --> 00:41:46.450
the bear has a big giant crowds,

742
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.580
like a terrible idea to be tripping your balls off in the jungle.
Yeah.

743
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:54.150
Wandering through the woods by yourself.
And I'm assuming it's nighttime,

744
00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:55.850
it's nighttime.
Well,
I'm,
I'm laid out.

745
00:41:55.851 --> 00:41:58.310
This is all happening and this is all happening in my mind.
Okay,

746
00:41:58.311 --> 00:42:00.980
so you're not even move.
I'm not even moving.
Okay.
No,
I'm fully,

747
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:03.650
you weren't actually in the woods.
No,
no,
no.

748
00:42:03.651 --> 00:42:07.770
I'm on my back and the jungle and the physical world.
And then in the mind's eye,

749
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:08.703
yeah,

750
00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:13.370
my mind's eye walking around for real close care.
Yeah,

751
00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.353
that's a little scary.

752
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.510
So I get dropped in like a forest and it was like a woodsy forest,

753
00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.810
like a Colorado type for us different than the jungle and a,

754
00:42:20.811 --> 00:42:25.100
I see a bear and the bear has a gold crown on his head and a bunch of gold

755
00:42:25.101 --> 00:42:28.250
chains all over it.
Mr t bear.
Exactly.

756
00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.970
And the bear is kind of struggling and I see kind of like a ghost of the bear,

757
00:42:31.971 --> 00:42:35.120
like the spirit of the bear and it's trying to leave the bear's body.

758
00:42:35.121 --> 00:42:37.550
It's trying to like venture out,
but it stuck.

759
00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:40.610
And then the bear catches side of me.
And that's the crazy,

760
00:42:40.611 --> 00:42:42.440
another crazy thing about seeing these beings.

761
00:42:42.441 --> 00:42:46.700
It's like the bear like turns to look at me and like notices me,
you know,

762
00:42:46.701 --> 00:42:50.600
it's not like he was waiting for me there.
He's like,
Oh,
here you are.
You know,

763
00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:53.000
like you just showed up.
So he turns to me and he goes,

764
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:58.390
I remember before this crown and all these chains when I was just a bear and I

765
00:42:59.781 --> 00:43:04.730
could run free in the woods.
And I was like,
okay,
okay.
I got it.

766
00:43:04.731 --> 00:43:07.390
And basically what he was trying his tell me was,
is that,
you know,

767
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:12.400
don't ever let money and wealth or anything tie you down and keep you from your

768
00:43:12.591 --> 00:43:16.500
freedom and expressing what your real nature is,
you know,
and,

769
00:43:16.501 --> 00:43:19.730
and really kind of like a Buddhist sentiment that he was telling a difficult

770
00:43:19.731 --> 00:43:23.510
thing for Google to do.
It sounds like such a noble task when you're poor.

771
00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:26.900
The real problem is once you actually get money,
you know,

772
00:43:26.901 --> 00:43:29.780
one of the big things that happens with people and they get money as they say,

773
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:31.940
they're scared of not having money.

774
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:35.980
So they start doing things they think like,
um,

775
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:38.870
like they'll look,
especially I guess see this with comics.

776
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:43.300
They like start saying things they think people want to hear or they started,
uh,

777
00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:43.651
you know,

778
00:43:43.651 --> 00:43:48.651
like avoiding any sort of controversy that might get them in trouble or moving

779
00:43:48.801 --> 00:43:52.520
away from anything that might be controversial because they want to keep this

780
00:43:52.521 --> 00:43:53.580
money coming in.
Yeah,

781
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:57.290
I got a career now I'm got to keep my career coming and the bear becomes no

782
00:43:57.291 --> 00:44:01.250
longer a bear.
And this analogy there got gold chains on looking like a retard.

783
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:04.550
Yeah,
exactly.
It does bear asking for a picnic bench,

784
00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.970
but you might have it got rid of,
I didn't get real gay after that.

785
00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:11.970
So at that point,
like I,
I dunno,

786
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:16.190
I somehow was able to like free the bears spirit after he said that and we went

787
00:44:16.191 --> 00:44:18.800
like frolicking through the words,
it's yoga guys,
your boy,

788
00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:19.910
where's my boy after that.

789
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:23.660
So we like cruise around and then the final visitation from this being as I was

790
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:27.350
cruising through the forest,
like hopping over logs.
It was very like Robin Hood,

791
00:44:27.351 --> 00:44:28.610
cartoon style,
you know,

792
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.580
it'll John and Robin Hood and through the forest type of program and then sew
up,

793
00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:33.120
you know.

794
00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.140
And then all of a sudden I see an eagle up in the sky and I like raise my

795
00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:39.840
consciousness to the eagle,
anything.
It was really like a dream state.

796
00:44:39.841 --> 00:44:41.010
So anything's possible,
you know?

797
00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:45.330
So I just kind of flowed up to the Eagle and Eagle looks at me and I'm cruising

798
00:44:45.331 --> 00:44:49.920
along.
The Ego says,
do you know how I see so well?
And I said,
no.

799
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:50.640
He says,

800
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:55.640
because I see through everybody else's eyes and I took a moment to sink in and

801
00:44:56.551 --> 00:44:58.920
what he was showing me there was that.
Also,

802
00:44:58.921 --> 00:45:02.850
often when we try and imagine what people are thinking or feeling,

803
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:07.170
we have our own bias.
We don't actually truly see through their eyes,

804
00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:10.500
like imagine what their fears and motivations and weaknesses,

805
00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:11.970
even the people that we don't like.

806
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:15.180
We always see him with this kind of bias look like,
oh,

807
00:45:15.181 --> 00:45:16.950
that dude's a fucking idiot.
But you know,

808
00:45:16.951 --> 00:45:19.410
if we really try to get into their eyes,

809
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:23.220
you can learn something about that person and learn something about the world by

810
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:28.221
actually dropping all of your kind of own ego and really assuming the eyes of

811
00:45:29.581 --> 00:45:31.470
whatever else you're,
you're trying to look at,

812
00:45:31.471 --> 00:45:34.380
whether it's an animal or a person or something like that.
I've tried that.

813
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.090
I've tried that with a lot of people.
I try that,

814
00:45:36.091 --> 00:45:38.010
especially with people that don't like,
yeah,

815
00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:41.100
I was trying to figure out how they got the,
especially once I had kids,

816
00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:44.250
I had kids and I started looking at people completely different cause I looked

817
00:45:44.251 --> 00:45:45.990
at them as babies and become adults.

818
00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:49.890
So looked at this weird process like I used to see someone who is weak and like

819
00:45:49.891 --> 00:45:53.780
you,
it's your fucking weak bitch.
That's what I would think.
And now I love you.

820
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:55.530
See to do,
wow,
what happened?
How'd you get?

821
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.540
How'd you get to this spot where you don't,

822
00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:01.080
you know what I'm going to encourage or you don't have any real whatever,

823
00:46:01.081 --> 00:46:04.920
you know,
whatever it is or you hate or you're,
you know,
you're racist.
What it,

824
00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:08.180
whatever's broken on you.
How'd you get there?
Yep.

825
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:11.670
And that's a really valuable way to do it.
And also I'm sure for a comedy,

826
00:46:11.671 --> 00:46:11.851
you know,

827
00:46:11.851 --> 00:46:16.500
you have to put yourself into the laughers eyes and consciousness to a certain

828
00:46:16.501 --> 00:46:20.140
degree too.
Right?
I don't know,
man,
that I don't try to do.
Yeah.

829
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:24.840
I just try to do shit that I think is funny and they agree.
Cause I could not,

830
00:46:24.841 --> 00:46:28.720
I mean,
as soon as it's too many people,
too much of a different swath of people.

831
00:46:28.721 --> 00:46:32.550
Yeah.
And too many people have their own take on what's fun and what's not.

832
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:36.100
It's like what happens when you get a television show and a,

833
00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:40.020
then you get a whole slew of producers that have an opinion over what the

834
00:46:40.021 --> 00:46:42.960
character should be doing and what's funny and what's not funny.

835
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:48.210
Then it almost always goes to shit.
I mean,
so one strong voice sorta takes over.

836
00:46:48.211 --> 00:46:51.480
It's very hard to express your own sense of humor.

837
00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:55.650
I tried to express a sense of humors of a bunch of other funds or other random

838
00:46:55.651 --> 00:46:57.990
people.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That makes sense.
But you know,

839
00:46:57.991 --> 00:47:02.310
I guess so for me there was these three lessons from these three clearly,

840
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:07.110
seemingly,
you know,
different entities and uh,
and so yeah,

841
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:08.370
the question is,
you know,

842
00:47:08.371 --> 00:47:12.220
were these part of my own consciousness teaching me these lessons are worthies

843
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:15.340
did they all have the same voice?
No,
the dragon

844
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.580
and the Dragon,
Rick close,
but they're,
the dragon was really,

845
00:47:20.581 --> 00:47:23.190
I couldn't even mimic that voice.
It was like that booming.

846
00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:26.940
Like you're too close to the festival speakers base kind of voice.

847
00:47:26.941 --> 00:47:30.220
And the bear was just like,
like a man bear

848
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.780
<v 0>man voice,
I don't know.
And the Eagle was ego was a little bit more normal,</v>

849
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:38.050
but uh,
but yeah,
similar,
similar voices.
I mean,

850
00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:42.900
if had to fuck one of those animals,
which one?
I find it just for pride.
I,

851
00:47:42.901 --> 00:47:46.520
yeah,
just say you did it.
I find that that stone

852
00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:51.630
<v 3>themes reoccur with me over and over again,
just when I eat pot.
Those,
those,</v>

853
00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:56.460
those themes,
the themes of,
um,
of reality,
you know,
what are you,
what are your,

854
00:47:56.461 --> 00:48:00.150
what's your real motivation when you're doing things?
What is your,
uh,

855
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.820
what's your real experience with other people and how much,

856
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.510
how much of like disputes that you have with people or how much of it is your

857
00:48:06.511 --> 00:48:10.980
fault?
You know?
So I would think that if you take a hallucinogen,

858
00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:14.400
you know,
I'm sure you have the same thoughts.
You know,
when you try,

859
00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:17.430
if you try to better yourself,
you know,

860
00:48:17.431 --> 00:48:21.540
if you're trying to move your life in a more positive direction,

861
00:48:21.541 --> 00:48:26.541
you're going to have the same sort of key stumbling roadblocks.

862
00:48:26.641 --> 00:48:28.590
I think in the,
in the mind,

863
00:48:28.591 --> 00:48:32.040
like how much of my ego is holding me back?

864
00:48:32.041 --> 00:48:36.900
How much of my perception of reality is distorted?
And that's holding me back.

865
00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:39.510
So you would think that a drug,

866
00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:44.190
if it was just something that would make you see Jesus or dragons,

867
00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:48.980
you know,
that maybe that's what it is,
like these themes and that it's,

868
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.600
it's spelled out to you because the drug thinks you're an idiot.

869
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:53.900
<v 0>It's like showing bare.
Yeah.
Yeah,
exactly.</v>

870
00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:57.760
It comes to you in a way that you kind of already,
it's,
I mean the,
I mean,
no,

871
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:59.720
I don't mean that in any disrespectful way at all.

872
00:48:59.721 --> 00:49:01.370
But when I feel one of the things

873
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:06.550
<v 3>I feel most certainly when I do a DMT or something along those lines,</v>

874
00:49:06.871 --> 00:49:07.920
it's done.
I'm a fucking idiot.

875
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:10.620
<v 0>That's one of the humbling experience.
It's very,</v>

876
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:13.090
I was extremely humbled after those visitations.

877
00:49:13.091 --> 00:49:15.140
Cause you think that you got it all right.

878
00:49:15.141 --> 00:49:18.750
And then it shows you someone like the dragon comes along and just,
it's like,
ah,

879
00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:21.950
nobody like you were a little off.
So here's the truth.

880
00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.670
And now come to terms with it.
You're like,
oh shit,
you can't have it.
Right.

881
00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.900
It's part of being a human,
you know the,

882
00:49:27.901 --> 00:49:31.210
like the Dalai Lama doesn't even get a lane.
He doesn't have it.
Right.
Got that.

883
00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:34.640
Now he doesn't ever,
right.
Yeah.
He's ever got and he doesn't fuck.
Fuck.

884
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:36.940
He doesn't get his dick sucked.
Yeah.
It doesn't get his balls.

885
00:49:36.941 --> 00:49:40.060
And that's why he's not an effective leader.
How are you fully gonna Trust?

886
00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.730
I don't think he eats meat either.
He can go fuck himself.

887
00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:46.880
Do you think of like those crazy homeless people though that are sitting there

888
00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:50.540
talking,
having full on conversations with dragons,
do you think that's,

889
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:55.670
there's a big connection to actually feeling that and seeing that and opening

890
00:49:55.671 --> 00:50:00.380
your brain up to that,
to that guy 20 years?
It's a real good question really.

891
00:50:00.381 --> 00:50:01.214
And you'd be

892
00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:05.500
<v 3>disingenuous to,
to not address it because I think the,</v>

893
00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:10.540
what we said before that what's going on with those people in our medical idea,

894
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:12.520
you know,
the medical communities,
uh,

895
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:15.760
version of it is that there's an imbalance or a chemical imbalance.

896
00:50:15.761 --> 00:50:19.000
They have issues,
they have whatever it is,
they're psychotic,
they're there,

897
00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:24.070
you know,
paranoid schizophrenia,
whatever the diagnosis is,

898
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:28.340
we're going out on a limb and that there's some sort of chemicals

899
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:33.020
<v 0>that are out of whack there.
Well,
it's the brain's just a soup of chemicals.</v>

900
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:37.520
It's in the neuro transmitters,
receivers,
whatever the fuck the brain itself is,

901
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:42.200
the neurons,
all of it together mushing around.
If one of those is out of whack,

902
00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:46.430
you know,
and one of those is out of whack because you crazy.

903
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.270
Or one of those at a rack because you were at the,

904
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:54.260
at a hut in the fucking jungle.
Right.
He took some crazy shit,

905
00:50:54.261 --> 00:50:59.261
which is a soup of some roots that fucking blow your neurotransmitter levels out

906
00:51:00.861 --> 00:51:05.390
of the water,
like Shit's coming out of your ears.
I mean,
what is,

907
00:51:05.391 --> 00:51:08.690
what was really happening there is that might not be much different than what

908
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:11.510
that guy is experiencing at the bus stop.
Well,
I mean the con,

909
00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:14.780
the quality of content is actually there.

910
00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:19.810
Your brain is a healthy brain can bring you back to baseline on a DMT flash in

911
00:51:19.881 --> 00:51:20.714
15 minutes.

912
00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:24.320
I WASC is a little longer because it's absorbed by the stomach and so it's sort

913
00:51:24.321 --> 00:51:28.090
of a slower process.
The what,
what owe Osca is,

914
00:51:28.091 --> 00:51:31.340
is an orally active version of dimethyl trip to me,

915
00:51:31.341 --> 00:51:34.310
which is the most powerful psychedelic drug known demand,

916
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:36.980
which is also produced by your own brain.
Yeah.

917
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:40.280
That's the weirdest part about it is that it's an,
all these different plants.

918
00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:44.330
It's like in grass and all these fucking leaves and squirrels make it.

919
00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.990
It's everywhere.
That is,
there's a small amount and everything.

920
00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:51.140
The leaves that they choose.
In the jungle,
they choose the leaf called Chacruna,

921
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:54.950
which is one of the strongest DMT containing plants and in the jungle.

922
00:51:54.951 --> 00:51:57.830
But actually there's other plants like the Acacia plant from Australia,

923
00:51:58.190 --> 00:52:00.920
which has an even much higher DMT content.

924
00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:04.460
You can make an Iowasca out of other different things.

925
00:52:04.461 --> 00:52:08.590
Like you could use a Syrian rue and Acacia to make a different IOWASCA type

926
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:12.920
period.
You have a different quality visual experience.

927
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:15.710
Well that was one of the things they say about the um,
uh,

928
00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:20.660
the idea of the psychedelic experience is that when you're taking it,

929
00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:25.550
you're taking in the experiences of all the other people who've also experienced

930
00:52:25.551 --> 00:52:28.430
a psychedelic drug.
And as you do mushrooms,

931
00:52:28.431 --> 00:52:33.200
you are actually contributing to the library of mushroom experiences.

932
00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:33.820
Yeah.

933
00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:38.210
The collective unconscious of all of that becomes the spirit of the mushroom or

934
00:52:38.211 --> 00:52:40.670
the spirit of the IOWASCA.
That's generally how they talk about it.

935
00:52:40.671 --> 00:52:44.630
You know where else that acacia bushes in large quantities?

936
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:46.800
Israel.
Oh yeah.
Oh the,

937
00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:50.000
what they believed was the burning Bush that Moses is.

938
00:52:50.001 --> 00:52:54.620
Scholars believe that's legitimate guys who aren't even psychedelic scholars.

939
00:52:54.621 --> 00:52:58.900
Cause those are slippery scholars,
some of them,

940
00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:02.210
some of them a little sketchy.
But um,
this,

941
00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:05.900
there's a recent thing where these guys from,
uh,

942
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:07.880
some major university in Jerusalem,

943
00:53:07.881 --> 00:53:12.710
we're talking about how they believe that Moses receiving the 10 commandments

944
00:53:12.711 --> 00:53:17.711
from God and God taking the form of the burning Bush was most likely a Bush that

945
00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:22.790
contained psychedelic chemicals like smoking the Acacia Bush.
Makes Sense.

946
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:27.630
It totally makes so many of those mystical make perfect sense if you put them in

947
00:53:27.631 --> 00:53:30.810
a psychedelic drug perspective.
I mean,
that is the most obvious one ever though.

948
00:53:30.811 --> 00:53:35.040
Okay.
Yeah.
It's a burning Bush.
The non,
they're not calling it anything else.

949
00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:36.740
It's a burning Bush.
It,

950
00:53:36.741 --> 00:53:40.800
it just so happens to the Acacia Bush as the highest concentration of DMT,

951
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:44.670
any plan in the world.
And it grows all over the fucking place.
Right.

952
00:53:44.671 --> 00:53:49.290
Where this dude saw God,
you know what Bush did think it was burning.

953
00:53:49.291 --> 00:53:50.490
It was probably that Bush.

954
00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:54.270
I bet if you burn a bush and fucking got over it and sucked it all in,

955
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.300
I bet you would see the same shit,
Moses.

956
00:53:56.350 --> 00:54:00.300
Especially if you were hungry and you're walking around fasting or balls off

957
00:54:00.301 --> 00:54:02.430
anyway.
Yeah,
yeah,
absolutely.

958
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:07.140
I think a great many of the rich religious experiences that people have had can

959
00:54:07.141 --> 00:54:12.141
be connected to psychedelics including like Mayan art and Egypt ardor.

960
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:15.360
Cause one of the creepiest things that I've found is that,

961
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:20.430
especially on mushrooms,
I,
I've seen a lot of like Mayan things.

962
00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:25.640
I've seen like a lot of like mine imagery and like freshly painted Mayan

963
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:31.610
hieroglyphs like you see that sort of imagery and you wonder what came first,

964
00:54:31.921 --> 00:54:35.130
the chicken or the egg because you know these motherfuckers reading mushrooms

965
00:54:35.131 --> 00:54:39.420
like crazy.
I mean they were living in the jungle where these things grow.

966
00:54:39.421 --> 00:54:43.380
They look like dinner plates if you've ever seen them in Mexico had one of the

967
00:54:43.381 --> 00:54:46.240
richest traditions of,
of mushroom news.
Sure.
You know,

968
00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:49.860
that's where Gordon Wasson first found out about it and all these different

969
00:54:49.861 --> 00:54:54.861
Sharman in Mexico take people on these journeys to the spirit world using these,

970
00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:58.300
these,
these fucking dinner plate sized mushrooms.
That's one.

971
00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.320
The interesting thing about the psychedelics and make it seem like it's not your

972
00:55:01.321 --> 00:55:04.860
mind,
but like someone can take Iowasca anywhere in the world that desert,

973
00:55:04.861 --> 00:55:06.780
the mountains,
the city,
whatever,

974
00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:11.400
and they're almost always going to have similar visions of snakes and the jungle

975
00:55:11.401 --> 00:55:12.390
and these different banners.

976
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:15.870
Jaguar's always goes back to the jungle and you know,
how is that,

977
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:19.550
how is that possible?
If it's just solely being mind creative,

978
00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:23.040
it seems like that's where it gets weird and that's why even with these beings,

979
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:25.760
like,
you know,
I was laughing with uh,
with Mitch Schultz.

980
00:55:25.761 --> 00:55:29.570
I was talking to him the other day and uh,
and we are saying,
you know,

981
00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:32.880
if the Lebron James of I Wasco came along,

982
00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:36.330
he could go to these entities and figuring out what they do when they're not

983
00:55:36.331 --> 00:55:39.720
teaching people shit,
you know,
if they're real.
Because whenever they appear,

984
00:55:39.721 --> 00:55:42.390
they're always trying to teach you something or tell you something like,

985
00:55:42.391 --> 00:55:43.051
what are they doing today?

986
00:55:43.051 --> 00:55:47.490
Like hang out and play around like play board games or like what do they do in

987
00:55:47.491 --> 00:55:48.181
their life?
Like,

988
00:55:48.181 --> 00:55:52.830
how do you get to that point where you can experience more than just taking a

989
00:55:52.831 --> 00:55:56.240
lesson?
And that would be the way to determine whether these are just,
you know,

990
00:55:56.350 --> 00:55:59.700
ways that your mind is communicating with itself or whether these things have a

991
00:55:59.701 --> 00:56:02.760
life outside of this didactic purpose that they have.

992
00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:05.640
It feels like you're popping your head into somewhere.
You're not supposed to be.

993
00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:08.430
It does.
It really feels like you're like,
oh,
what am I doing here?

994
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:12.750
And they're like,
what are you doing here?
Yeah,
exactly.
Oh,
you're back.
Oh,

995
00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.470
you're back.
It's weird that they communicate with you.

996
00:56:16.471 --> 00:56:19.800
And sometimes in sentences and words you've heard before,

997
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:24.210
it might be a delay in your inner,
you know,
how you

998
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:24.491
<v 3>can,</v>

999
00:56:24.491 --> 00:56:28.810
like if you listen to your inner conscious talking and imagined the drug just

1000
00:56:28.811 --> 00:56:31.670
slows down your ability to,
uh,

1001
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:35.710
received your inner conscious voice.
And so it sounds like it's somebody else,

1002
00:56:35.711 --> 00:56:38.220
but it's really yourself and your inner conscious talking to yourself.

1003
00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:41.710
It could be,
yeah,
it could mean it could be a lot of different things for sure.

1004
00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:42.880
You know,
um,

1005
00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:47.140
I think one of the first DMT trips that I had,

1006
00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:52.410
one of the weirdest feelings about it all was that the idea of being connected

1007
00:56:53.081 --> 00:56:58.030
to everything sounds like such fucking hippie bullshit.
It sounds like nonsense.

1008
00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:02.440
You know,
say we are here,
but we are connected to everything.
It's,

1009
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:06.190
I'm not feeling that,
you know,
I don't,
I know that that might be real,

1010
00:57:06.191 --> 00:57:08.470
but for whatever reason,
I don't really feel that.

1011
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:13.120
I don't feel the subatomic particles.
I don't feel the Adam,

1012
00:57:13.121 --> 00:57:17.650
I don't feel the cell.
I don't,
I just feel me and I know that I'm breathing air,

1013
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:21.010
but I don't feel the fact that the air is connected to the,
all these,

1014
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:25.120
it's all a soup of things.
But when you have the DMT experience,

1015
00:57:25.121 --> 00:57:30.121
one of the things that it does is it strips whatever you're experiencing while

1016
00:57:30.131 --> 00:57:31.690
you're tripping your balls off.

1017
00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:35.650
It strips away the physical presence of things.

1018
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:40.120
And it's almost like the world of,
you know,

1019
00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:44.530
here's the ground,
here's the air and here's a tree and here's a building.

1020
00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:49.090
That world is replaced by a world where nothing has any matter.

1021
00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:52.210
Nothing has any physical matter,
but everything is everywhere.

1022
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:55.450
Everything is everywhere and you're in the middle of it and there's no ends and

1023
00:57:55.451 --> 00:57:59.680
there's no beginning.
There's no roof,
there's no floor.
It's just one thing.

1024
00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:04.240
It's all a part of one thing and you're in there scrambling,

1025
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:05.740
trying to make sense of it.

1026
00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:10.630
And these things come out of nowhere that are essentially constantly changing as

1027
00:58:10.631 --> 00:58:13.210
you're watching them.
So you're not even sure what the fuck it actually is.

1028
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:15.700
And you know,
it might be your own mind.

1029
00:58:15.701 --> 00:58:18.490
It might be you're my own mind trying to make sense of the whole thing,

1030
00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:20.890
but they're trying to give you information.

1031
00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:23.950
One of the things that I tried to tell you,
you to try to stop,

1032
00:58:23.951 --> 00:58:26.290
don't freak out and try to suck it all in.

1033
00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:30.760
Try to take in as much as you can because we know this is crazy.
And um,

1034
00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:33.970
and they tell you they love you too.
That's like,
it's always a big thing.

1035
00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:38.320
Like love you.
Like the one experiences that I had,
they sang to me like a child.

1036
00:58:38.321 --> 00:58:43.000
They had this song,
I love you.
600 million,
500,000 times,

1037
00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:46.790
which is like how a kid would say something and then we'd go look at this and

1038
00:58:46.791 --> 00:58:49.030
they would show me something fucking insane.

1039
00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:53.260
Something where you couldn't look at it like it was too beautiful to look at and

1040
00:58:53.261 --> 00:58:57.160
then it would say it again like I love you 600 million,
500,000 times,

1041
00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:00.250
look at this.
And every time it was looking at this like I was crying,

1042
00:59:00.251 --> 00:59:04.720
I remember crying cause what I was looking at was too impossible to,

1043
00:59:04.721 --> 00:59:08.140
to nothing could be that beautiful.
And every time they would say,
look at this,

1044
00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:10.690
it would get a million times more beautiful.
That was,

1045
00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:14.590
it was just taking my breath away.
I couldn't breathe.
It was like,
it was very,

1046
00:59:14.591 --> 00:59:19.000
very strange.
But it was,
it was very,
very,
very positive.

1047
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:23.690
The experience all over was very pops and so much of it was like,
dude,

1048
00:59:23.691 --> 00:59:26.450
relax.
Yeah,
relax.

1049
00:59:26.451 --> 00:59:31.430
Like this whole thing is first of all way beyond your control way big and new

1050
00:59:31.431 --> 00:59:35.240
thing and it's going to be fine.
Like that was like those,
like a big,

1051
00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:38.510
a big theme that if anything that I learned from it,

1052
00:59:39.490 --> 00:59:42.340
I learned that I learned,
I think a d I got,

1053
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:47.030
I think DMT made me a nicer person.
I think I learned how to chill out more.
Sure.

1054
00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:50.160
<v 2>It's really valuable that way actually that just speaking about what you were</v>

1055
00:59:50.161 --> 00:59:52.380
saying that so the third time I drunk,

1056
00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:55.140
I didn't have any particularly crazy visions,

1057
00:59:55.141 --> 00:59:59.460
but for three hours I like the,
at the hut that I was in,

1058
00:59:59.461 --> 01:00:03.870
everything else melted away and I felt myself dissolve into the floor of the

1059
01:00:03.871 --> 01:00:07.110
jungle and I was like,
yeah,

1060
01:00:07.111 --> 01:00:10.650
the bugs and the worms were crawling through me like the air was,

1061
01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:15.050
it was like I was no longer a physical being and I was absolutely one with the

1062
01:00:15.051 --> 01:00:18.330
gentleman and I was asking,
I was like,
Hey,
does the dragon want to show up?

1063
01:00:18.331 --> 01:00:20.880
Just anybody want to come.
But nobody wanted to come.

1064
01:00:20.881 --> 01:00:24.570
It was just like literally three hours just breathing with the jungle.

1065
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:26.310
And I left that and I was like,

1066
01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:29.580
it was just a really grounding and connecting experience.

1067
01:00:29.581 --> 01:00:33.450
But it was almost at that point,
I think the message to me was like,
you know,

1068
01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:37.170
we're done teaching you silly little lessons.
Like,
you know,
take this,

1069
01:00:37.171 --> 01:00:42.000
be grounded,
be humbled,
be connected,
and go off and do,
you know,
do your work.

1070
01:00:42.001 --> 01:00:46.440
Do what you need to do.
I was his version of kids together,
bitches.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1071
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:50.910
It was,
it was just really so peaceful.
And so,
but I remember it,
you know,

1072
01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:53.100
all of the things that normally would creep me out,

1073
01:00:53.101 --> 01:00:55.350
the creepy crawlers of the jungle,
you know,

1074
01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:57.650
you look at the ground in the jungle and it's alive,
you know,

1075
01:00:57.670 --> 01:01:01.380
and there's ants and all kinds of shit.
That was,
that was me,

1076
01:01:01.381 --> 01:01:05.390
that was in my body and I was just totally relaxed and disintegrated.

1077
01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.880
And that was a really kind of powerful medicinal effect.

1078
01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:13.280
<v 3>Vine of thorn sliding down a vine of thorns naked naked.</v>

1079
01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:17.590
<v 2>That was the fucked up.
I was like,
why do I gotta make it?
Like,</v>

1080
01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:22.120
why does it take my genitals first?
Like what reason is just shredding,

1081
01:01:22.121 --> 01:01:24.470
shredding them.
How much are you in?

1082
01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.410
You don't feel the physical pain,
but you,
you have that kind of horror,

1083
01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.630
the horror of your genitals being mutilated as you sliding down the line,

1084
01:01:34.631 --> 01:01:37.360
a thorn so it can get intense,
but you get just got to,

1085
01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.810
you got to remove yourself from that kind of an angst,
you know,

1086
01:01:40.811 --> 01:01:42.100
and just witness and allow,

1087
01:01:42.101 --> 01:01:45.090
that's the mantra anybody is going through any of these experiences.

1088
01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:49.810
Just witness it and allow it to happen.
Wow.
Whatever it may be.
But you know,

1089
01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:52.570
I,
the last experience I did was the Boga experience.

1090
01:01:52.571 --> 01:01:56.470
And this one really kind of drew some counterpoints to those two experiences.

1091
01:01:56.471 --> 01:01:57.940
They're so wildly different.

1092
01:01:57.941 --> 01:02:01.600
And I think I touched on this last time because I was fresh from a Boga,
but um,

1093
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:05.500
I was couple show you some things that you have no fucking clue what it means.

1094
01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.410
Like one of the visions I had after the drag and the bear that you go,

1095
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:11.140
cause I was on this viking ship and it was rolling through this.

1096
01:02:11.141 --> 01:02:14.710
See this moonlit see,
you know,
I'm like,
all right,
sweet.
I'm on this ship,

1097
01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:15.820
I don't know what's going on.

1098
01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:19.060
And then all of a sudden the ship peels out and heads straight towards the moon.

1099
01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:22.770
So we're going straight towards this giant blue moon and this moon line is like

1100
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:23.783
bathing me.

1101
01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:27.720
And then this purple orb comes drifting out of the moon and it's drifting

1102
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:31.040
towards me,
drifting towards me,
and I opened my mouth and I eat it just,

1103
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:36.150
and then I was like,
wow,
that was significant.
That must have done something,

1104
01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:40.440
but nothing happened.
I don't know what it was.
It was about your balls off.

1105
01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.110
That was it.
And then the whole time,
even to this day,

1106
01:02:43.111 --> 01:02:47.730
I mean the best explanation I had was maybe it had something to do with like the

1107
01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:49.650
feminine energy,
the mood,
but I don't fucking know.

1108
01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:52.260
I have no clue if that had any meaning at all.

1109
01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:56.730
Or if it was just some random trip.
Did you sit in a feminine energy or the Moon?

1110
01:02:56.850 --> 01:02:59.790
Why would you think of the movie?
You don't know?
I don't know.

1111
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:04.480
That's what I'm saying.
I'm
just reaching for straws.
I mean,

1112
01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:08.930
that's a fully,
it is feminine.
Loves that,
that,
that,

1113
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:12.600
that feeling,
that way of distinguishing things.

1114
01:03:12.601 --> 01:03:15.930
The Feminine Energy of the forest.
Yeah.
Who knows?
But you know,

1115
01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:19.740
but that's the difference between a Bogan,
like a Bogo will tell you like,
hey,

1116
01:03:19.741 --> 01:03:20.020
what,

1117
01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:24.360
it doesn't bother with the pictures of this strange moon and this purple orb and

1118
01:03:24.361 --> 01:03:27.780
be like,
Yo,
this is the truth.
Like,
and it's in kind of your own voice,

1119
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.850
but I have Watsco will give you things.
I mean,

1120
01:03:29.851 --> 01:03:33.270
some things were very poignant and you know,
taught me a lesson,

1121
01:03:33.271 --> 01:03:34.350
like the things with the allies,

1122
01:03:34.351 --> 01:03:36.450
but there's all these other visions that you're left,

1123
01:03:36.451 --> 01:03:40.320
like what the fuck was that can be.

1124
01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.950
It can be a challenge in,
in some of that,
some of that regard.

1125
01:03:43.951 --> 01:03:46.710
But the physical experience you feel,
how connected you feel,

1126
01:03:46.711 --> 01:03:51.180
how cleanse do you feel?
Because afterwards,
after that third session,

1127
01:03:51.181 --> 01:03:54.150
he took one of his cigarettes,
the nicotine year ristic uh,

1128
01:03:54.151 --> 01:03:59.151
cigarettes and he blew it like down my spine and like on the top of my head and

1129
01:03:59.641 --> 01:04:01.170
in different key parts.
And I was like,

1130
01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:03.060
I wasn't even that nauseous that whole time.

1131
01:04:03.061 --> 01:04:04.590
The third time I felt very comfortable.

1132
01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.250
I got back to the room and just fucking lost it.

1133
01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:13.460
Like I felt like I was heaving some giant ball of something from like the depths

1134
01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:16.500
of my soul.
I don't know what was going on.

1135
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:19.680
It hit my mouth so hard that I exploded.

1136
01:04:19.681 --> 01:04:21.870
Vomit from my mouth and my nose.

1137
01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:26.850
And there's nothing worse than stomach acid and old iowasca blasting out of your

1138
01:04:26.851 --> 01:04:30.500
nose at the same time.
And at the same time my eyes are watery.

1139
01:04:30.501 --> 01:04:33.630
It can hardly see it.
There's no electricity in the bathroom cause we're,

1140
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:36.300
you know,
there's the,
they run the generator like three hours.

1141
01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.620
So then I have to like turn around and like blast some shit in the toilet too.

1142
01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:44.850
And it's like this brutal like savage cleanse.
Wow.
And I,

1143
01:04:44.851 --> 01:04:48.720
and that somehow it seemed triggered by whatever kind of,
you know,

1144
01:04:48.721 --> 01:04:50.850
cigarette cleansing thing he did the next day.

1145
01:04:50.851 --> 01:04:54.660
Cause I saw him the next morning and he just had this big smile on his face and

1146
01:04:54.661 --> 01:04:58.200
he asked me in his broken English and Spanish,
you know,
how was last night?

1147
01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:00.660
And I was like,
what the fuck man?

1148
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:05.760
Like these like tobacco and just nods and laps and pat me pats me on the back

1149
01:05:05.761 --> 01:05:09.870
and keeps the tobacco makes you throw up and shit yourself.
I don't know.

1150
01:05:09.871 --> 01:05:10.501
I mean whether it,

1151
01:05:10.501 --> 01:05:15.180
the tobacco is a vehicle for some kind of trigger or whether it itself did

1152
01:05:15.181 --> 01:05:18.400
something,
whatever it happened.
I had like the most

1153
01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:22.090
<v 0>intense purge that I've ever had in my life,</v>

1154
01:05:22.091 --> 01:05:26.440
like savage and that was his intention while doing it.
So was it mental?

1155
01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:30.880
It does have a different,
maybe it wasn't tobacco,
you know,

1156
01:05:30.881 --> 01:05:35.760
maybe that was when he like tobacco,
it was really some kind of pointers,

1157
01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:39.600
but it was,
it was potent.
And that's a,

1158
01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:42.430
that's something that I think that's why they call it the master medicine

1159
01:05:42.431 --> 01:05:45.940
because you feel like you purge all of these different poisons from your body.

1160
01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:51.220
Jesus Christ.
It seems like you should be able to do that in America.
Yeah,

1161
01:05:51.221 --> 01:05:54.910
absolutely.
So ridiculous.
You have to get on a canoe to do this.
Absolutely.

1162
01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.350
You know,
all the way to Peru people to do.

1163
01:05:58.670 --> 01:06:03.490
She's a little to get a nice hotel,
get a steak consumer,
nice.

1164
01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:06.390
A resort.
It's just,
it's really preposterous.
I mean,

1165
01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:10.690
to think that people would be abusing,
I mean,
it's not fucking fun.

1166
01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:15.490
It's valuable.
It's Madison.
It's like you do it with,
uh,
you know,
with,

1167
01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:20.110
with intention.
Nobody gets through it unscathed.
You're going to learn something.

1168
01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:21.650
It's like,
I don't,
I don't,

1169
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:26.670
I've never heard of anybody that has had like a real deep psychedelic journey

1170
01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:30.580
that didn't come back and go,
wow,
I gotta fucking rethink everything.
I'm never,

1171
01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:35.350
I don't know anybody that has a real one,
you know?
I mean,
if you,
if you don't,

1172
01:06:35.351 --> 01:06:39.450
Jesus Christ,
what fucking hope is there for you?
Right.
You know?
Alright,

1173
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:44.170
you goddamn Dullard
if you're a,
you know,

1174
01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:46.180
if you're able to do that in cities,

1175
01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:48.700
if there was places where you could go get your shit together,

1176
01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:51.620
we'd have way more people with their shit together.
Totally.
We really,

1177
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:55.390
what's the counter balance?
It's like the way to counterbalance all of this,

1178
01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:55.811
you know,

1179
01:06:55.811 --> 01:07:00.400
living in an apartment and grinding and strip malls and end to doing shit.

1180
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.160
You don't lie.
Don't cheat.
You don't like because it doesn't,

1181
01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:06.790
it doesn't mean that every,
you know,
everybody can't live the perfect life.

1182
01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:10.120
But guess what?
You're not everybody.
Okay?

1183
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:14.470
The world's going to keep going as,
as it always has,
with or without you.

1184
01:07:14.471 --> 01:07:18.460
It's going to be going and it was too many.
You're not that important,
okay?
So if,

1185
01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:23.200
if that is the case,
it is possible for you.
You,
the individual.

1186
01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:26.980
Then again,
this whole thing might be your imagination.

1187
01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:29.830
I might be a creation of your imagination as you hear this.

1188
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:32.590
I might not even exist,
okay?

1189
01:07:32.591 --> 01:07:37.000
I might be here just to get these words into your mind to,

1190
01:07:37.001 --> 01:07:41.470
so somehow or another usic left when everybody wants you to Zig,
right?

1191
01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:46.630
You know,
there's just,
maybe that's what it is and I'm not skeptical.
Why not?

1192
01:07:46.631 --> 01:07:50.500
Real?
I'm not real.
I am real Joe Rogan.
Goddammit.
You're real.

1193
01:07:50.501 --> 01:07:55.390
And the influence for you to,
to stray from the herd,
you know,
you know how they,

1194
01:07:55.391 --> 01:07:57.310
uh,
there was an old debate,
you know,
that was,

1195
01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:01.000
that was a popular debate for a while amongst philosophers.
Are we real?

1196
01:08:01.001 --> 01:08:04.540
How do you know if we're real?
And there was a famous case where one philosopher,

1197
01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:07.060
someone was,
you know,
going off on that how you have no,

1198
01:08:07.061 --> 01:08:10.270
you don't know that you're really,
you don't know that I'm real,
whatever.

1199
01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:15.130
And he takes off his glove and he slaps the guy slaps the guy across the face.

1200
01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.700
It was like,
was that real?

1201
01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:22.660
And that kind of in my fucking needed that guy in his imaginary worlds on the

1202
01:08:23.171 --> 01:08:24.710
face and you're get anything done.
That's the,

1203
01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:29.150
that's the only way you can effectively combat that argument.
Weird idea,
man.

1204
01:08:29.151 --> 01:08:30.340
I mean you think about your,

1205
01:08:30.341 --> 01:08:33.830
you're tripping your balls off and Iowasca and certain people are seeing Jesus,

1206
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.431
you know,

1207
01:08:34.431 --> 01:08:37.520
and then other people are seeing jaguars and they're seeing things they're

1208
01:08:37.521 --> 01:08:40.460
scared of or things that seem that they revere these ideas.

1209
01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:45.950
I am not convinced that the imagination only has the power to create things then

1210
01:08:45.951 --> 01:08:47.990
manifest them in the real world with actions.

1211
01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:53.170
It might have a secondary power and might be have an actual power of creation.

1212
01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:56.270
I don't know what the fuck happens when you leave my house.

1213
01:08:56.300 --> 01:09:01.190
I'm pretty sure you're getting your car and you go to your life and you'd go and

1214
01:09:01.191 --> 01:09:04.410
do your thing and hanging out with your girlfriend and getting your car and,

1215
01:09:04.650 --> 01:09:07.630
and I'm pretty sure you do the same thing,
but I'm not positive.

1216
01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:12.980
I'm not really positive about any of this and I'm not positive that as you move

1217
01:09:12.981 --> 01:09:15.770
in a certain direction that you know you're there,

1218
01:09:15.771 --> 01:09:18.590
you're the same person every step of the way,
you're the same.
You,

1219
01:09:18.591 --> 01:09:22.190
there might be an infinite number of use with every single decision you make,

1220
01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:26.270
branches off into another you and another way and another version,

1221
01:09:26.271 --> 01:09:29.240
another reality and all these realities to intertwine with each other.

1222
01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:32.710
And then we meet,
you know,
that's why sometimes when you run into someone,

1223
01:09:32.730 --> 01:09:36.890
it's like you been on a path and you've been a journey and this motherfucker has

1224
01:09:36.891 --> 01:09:41.210
been on a different thing,
you know,
not the same as you,
less,
you know,

1225
01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:45.170
less self,
uh,
self objective,

1226
01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:48.350
less self analytical and you know,

1227
01:09:48.351 --> 01:09:51.650
maybe maybe self destructive and then you around them.
It's like,

1228
01:09:51.651 --> 01:09:54.260
how did I ever hang out with you?
Like you were,
we're live,

1229
01:09:54.261 --> 01:09:56.360
we live in a different world.
Kind of do,

1230
01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:58.890
maybe kind of do live in a different world.
Maybe you're,

1231
01:09:59.230 --> 01:10:04.130
I the idea that time is just one flat linear thing that we're all sort of living

1232
01:10:04.131 --> 01:10:08.270
our lives in and this one sort of band,
maybe that's not real.

1233
01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:10.820
Maybe it's like just like the DMT dimension.

1234
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:15.830
Maybe it's just a fucking great big giant soup of potential universes that are

1235
01:10:15.831 --> 01:10:20.390
constantly shifting and we just flipped back and forth from one to the other and

1236
01:10:20.391 --> 01:10:24.180
move through them.
Like,
Oh yeah,
that's,
uh,
it's,

1237
01:10:24.181 --> 01:10:25.900
it's so hard to say.
I mean,
I,

1238
01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:29.240
I particularly like the paradigm that the Shamans have there,

1239
01:10:29.241 --> 01:10:32.560
in which case they describe,
you know,
all of these different dimensions,

1240
01:10:32.730 --> 01:10:36.710
dimensions as the layers of an onion and each person as a toothpick that's

1241
01:10:36.711 --> 01:10:38.510
pierce is all the different layers of the onion.

1242
01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:43.670
And so that you're occupied in your consciousness on the first tangible layers,

1243
01:10:43.761 --> 01:10:45.740
which encompassed the first through the fourth,
you know,

1244
01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:48.440
space and time basically.
That's what you're conscious of.

1245
01:10:48.650 --> 01:10:51.800
And then the fifth part of the toothpick,
as you move up to another layer,

1246
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:54.350
that's the dream state.
That's the collective consciousness.

1247
01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.380
And then the sixth and seventh,
uh,
dimensions,

1248
01:10:57.381 --> 01:11:01.850
those have the disembodied nonhuman entities that you interact with.

1249
01:11:01.851 --> 01:11:03.950
Like the floats that I found were from the seven,

1250
01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:07.940
they would call it the dragon and other these other things that you see,

1251
01:11:07.941 --> 01:11:10.310
you know,
the people singing you child songs.

1252
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:14.280
Those are beings of the sixth dimension.
And then the eighth dimension

1253
01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:19.050
<v 2>is this kind of oversight dimension where you can actually manipulate all the</v>

1254
01:11:19.051 --> 01:11:22.500
dimensions beneath it and see,
you know,
see everything.

1255
01:11:22.501 --> 01:11:25.950
It's like the highest vantage point where you can see and,
uh,

1256
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:29.010
the dimension of imminent possibility where you can basically do what you're

1257
01:11:29.011 --> 01:11:30.240
saying with your imagination,

1258
01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:33.930
believe things into reality from the eighth dimension,
you know,

1259
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.550
imagine things into reality.

1260
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:39.680
<v 3>Has anybody ever had an experience from the eighth dimension where they imagine</v>

1261
01:11:39.681 --> 01:11:42.200
some reality and then manifested it and then wrote about it?

1262
01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:46.860
<v 2>Um,
I,
this is where I shop.
Yeah.
The shamans,</v>

1263
01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.160
the Shamans do you know and happen,

1264
01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.250
that's where they say they got the idea to create Iowasca and they get these,

1265
01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:57.180
they get these messages and these different herbal treatments and you know it's

1266
01:11:57.181 --> 01:12:00.780
from these eight dimension teachings that they have.
But you know,
again,

1267
01:12:00.781 --> 01:12:03.450
I think there hasn't been enough of that,

1268
01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:07.560
but it's because there's not enough fucking people who have the skills able to

1269
01:12:07.561 --> 01:12:12.561
do that to also not only get there but then communicate the idea to a mass

1270
01:12:12.631 --> 01:12:13.560
market.
You know what I mean?

1271
01:12:13.561 --> 01:12:18.450
It's just such a limited swath of people who are able to access that dimension a

1272
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:22.080
and then B to have that to cross section that with the amount of people who

1273
01:12:22.081 --> 01:12:26.280
could then think of something,
bring something back and express it.

1274
01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.230
You starts to get really small numbers.
So

1275
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:33.280
<v 3>it's so funny how many people who are productive members of society who are</v>

1276
01:12:33.281 --> 01:12:37.840
interested in personal growth,
who are all discipline,
getting their shit done,

1277
01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:42.370
would never consider doing drugs to further themselves.

1278
01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:46.990
They would never even consider the possibility.
And it sounds like bullshit.

1279
01:12:46.991 --> 01:12:49.030
It sounds like an excuse to do drugs.

1280
01:12:49.690 --> 01:12:54.690
But really the greatest leaps I've personally experienced have been out of

1281
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:56.680
psychedelic trips for sure.

1282
01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:58.380
<v 2>Absolutely.
You know,
I was watching that.</v>

1283
01:12:58.381 --> 01:13:01.020
I've watched the Ray Kurzweil documentary transcendent man.

1284
01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:04.050
And you seen that one?
Yeah.
And,
uh,
it occurred to me,
you know,

1285
01:13:04.051 --> 01:13:08.280
he's always looking for these different technologies to answer some two basic

1286
01:13:08.281 --> 01:13:10.620
questions.
One,
he wants to conquer death,
and two,

1287
01:13:10.621 --> 01:13:13.230
he wants to kind of revive his father's memory.
I mean,

1288
01:13:13.231 --> 01:13:14.880
those are big overriding forces.

1289
01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:18.390
He also has a lot of altruistic goals and he's an absolute genius,

1290
01:13:18.391 --> 01:13:19.224
no doubt about it.

1291
01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:24.060
But he's overlooking some very basic technologies that have been around forever.

1292
01:13:24.061 --> 01:13:26.460
And these technologies are the psychedelics.

1293
01:13:26.461 --> 01:13:31.060
Like I really truly believe that you can look at those as a technology,
you know,

1294
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:35.820
and the technology of Iowasca can get him over his fear of death and show him

1295
01:13:35.821 --> 01:13:36.541
that,
you know,

1296
01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:40.800
there is an eternal part of him and everybody that's going to extend past to

1297
01:13:40.801 --> 01:13:43.410
this meat sack that we're currently walking around in.

1298
01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.490
But he's ignoring that technology because he's bought into the lie that this is

1299
01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:49.720
a drug and this is bad,
you know?
And,
and the,
uh,

1300
01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:54.720
Boga technology could get him direct access to the memories of his father.

1301
01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:57.060
So even if he wasn't really talking to his father,

1302
01:13:57.061 --> 01:14:00.240
I haven't made up a decision as to whether you're actually accessing these

1303
01:14:00.241 --> 01:14:02.820
people are just conversing with their memory.

1304
01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:07.440
He's at least going to be able to access the memories that he's trying to bring

1305
01:14:07.441 --> 01:14:08.580
back through technology.

1306
01:14:08.850 --> 01:14:12.580
There'll be able to access them and be able to communicate with his father and

1307
01:14:12.610 --> 01:14:16.960
maybe have some Cathartic piece from those,

1308
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:19.450
from those experiences.
But because you know,

1309
01:14:19.451 --> 01:14:22.600
some body in their higher knowledge and said,
oh,

1310
01:14:22.601 --> 01:14:25.300
these things are illegal in the United States where,
you know,

1311
01:14:25.301 --> 01:14:27.790
they're legal and different places,
but illegal here,

1312
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:32.230
he's completely ignored those technologies and it's been,
you know,
something,
uh,

1313
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:35.530
that's really sad for his life may be good for all of ours because he's been

1314
01:14:35.710 --> 01:14:39.070
rabidly pushing forward other technologies to get there.

1315
01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:42.970
And so he's advanced humankind dramatically where maybe he wouldn't have a feed

1316
01:14:42.971 --> 01:14:44.500
out of,
had access to these other things.

1317
01:14:44.501 --> 01:14:49.360
But it's really interesting how a genius like that can be so focused on one area

1318
01:14:49.361 --> 01:14:52.630
and then just ignore something that's so right there in front of them have been

1319
01:14:52.631 --> 01:14:53.740
around for thousands of years.

1320
01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:56.470
Well it's almost impossible to know everything about everything.

1321
01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:59.440
I mean it is impossible to know everything about everything.
And you know,

1322
01:14:59.441 --> 01:15:03.610
a guy like that is obviously very driven and very successful and he's a,

1323
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:07.090
he's a guy who works very hard and he's a very no nonsense sort of a guy.

1324
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:11.540
And I think that guys like that they look at drugs as being a way to derail

1325
01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:12.770
yourself.
Yeah.
You know,

1326
01:15:12.771 --> 01:15:17.080
it's a self indulgent sort of a self destructive activity.
Propaganda.

1327
01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:21.100
Yeah.
Poor fools.
Yeah.
Propaganda.
It's a,
it's a bummer.

1328
01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:22.750
I actually had another thought.

1329
01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:24.520
This is kind of changing the subject a little bit,

1330
01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:29.080
but I think I have my develop my own version of the singularity.
I think,

1331
01:15:29.081 --> 01:15:29.261
you know,

1332
01:15:29.261 --> 01:15:32.950
he has a very kind of technological kind of view of when that's going to happen,

1333
01:15:32.951 --> 01:15:35.830
when man and machine become indistinguishable.
And you know,

1334
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:39.010
I follow a lot of what he's saying.
I think that,
you know,

1335
01:15:39.011 --> 01:15:41.950
I think that nanotechnology could eventually take over the immune

1336
01:15:41.951 --> 01:15:46.840
responsibilities and the computational responsibilities that we currently have.

1337
01:15:46.841 --> 01:15:48.660
Like I'm,
I'm fine with that.
Um,

1338
01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:53.110
but I don't believe that's really the singularity cause I certainly do believe

1339
01:15:53.111 --> 01:15:54.520
in an eternal part of us.

1340
01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:59.410
And I think that the real singularity is going to come when we advanced to the

1341
01:15:59.411 --> 01:16:04.411
stage where we can consciously take that eternal part and choose which body we

1342
01:16:04.481 --> 01:16:08.320
want to be in and whether we want to be in it or not.
So we,
that whole death,

1343
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:11.860
you know,
the myth of death when we think we die and then we think it's all over,

1344
01:16:11.861 --> 01:16:16.030
it's really a transition when we transcend that and we can just take our spirit

1345
01:16:16.031 --> 01:16:19.120
and say,
okay,
I'm going to live in this body for a little while,
and then,
okay,

1346
01:16:19.121 --> 01:16:20.940
I'm done with that body.
I'll take the,

1347
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:23.170
take my spirit and push it into another body.

1348
01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.230
And so that consciousness never experiences the memory loss,

1349
01:16:26.231 --> 01:16:29.560
never experiences that lack of connectedness with everything else.

1350
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:33.610
I think for me,
you know,
that is that,
that is the true singularity.

1351
01:16:33.611 --> 01:16:38.611
And I think that singularity would come when the really pushed the advances in

1352
01:16:39.731 --> 01:16:42.700
this kind of psychedelic exploration.
You know,

1353
01:16:42.701 --> 01:16:44.290
I don't think that comes from technology.

1354
01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:48.490
Maybe we do after extend our lives another 500 years to be able to get there.

1355
01:16:48.730 --> 01:16:52.570
You know,
and technology can help us extend our lives for 500 years or whatever.

1356
01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:56.890
But I think ultimately the big advances that are going to take us to that

1357
01:16:56.950 --> 01:17:01.030
complete paradigm shifting level are going to come from,
you know,

1358
01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:05.080
manipulating molecules like DMT and how they interact with the brain and

1359
01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:08.860
transcending and being able to master these altered extra states of

1360
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:09.990
consciousness.
Yeah,

1361
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:13.760
<v 3>I think that the technology is sort of a psychedelic experience.</v>

1362
01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:17.980
It's just a really slow moving one.
But it's uh,
uh,
what,

1363
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:22.460
what psychedelics do is they dissolve boundaries and they create the impossible

1364
01:17:22.461 --> 01:17:26.990
in front of you and that sort of humbling to the ego and provide you with a

1365
01:17:26.991 --> 01:17:30.560
limitless source of information.
That's the Internet.
I mean,
the Internet,

1366
01:17:30.561 --> 01:17:35.060
the Internet that is psychedelic defined,
the Internet is Psychedelic,
you know,

1367
01:17:35.061 --> 01:17:37.760
it's just,
it's not a big hallucination.

1368
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:42.170
So we sort of mistake the concept of what,
what is psychedelic,

1369
01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:47.620
but the technology for sure is changing everything and providing people with

1370
01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:53.380
things that to them will be a regular part of their everyday life.

1371
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:58.870
But just a hundred years ago were impossible and science fiction and insane,

1372
01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.790
you know?
And then it just becomes normal and you just get used to it.

1373
01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:06.240
If we stay alive for a million years,
what does this going to look like?
I mean,

1374
01:18:06.241 --> 01:18:09.060
yeah.
You know what I mean?
I mean,
it will look psychedelic it,

1375
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:11.760
it'll look like a goddamn DMT flash.

1376
01:18:11.761 --> 01:18:15.290
The world will look like something that we can't even wrap our heads around.

1377
01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:19.160
We all have Google goggles on and we're walking around reading each other's

1378
01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:22.540
Auras and you know,
there's new scanners that they're introducing it,

1379
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:26.750
the TSA that are going to be able to a scan what you've had to eat that day.

1380
01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:31.520
Like literally there'll be something like that for like drug meals that are

1381
01:18:31.521 --> 01:18:34.660
swapping for everything.
Not only that,
well,

1382
01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:36.200
they'll be able to tell if people are high,

1383
01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:39.740
they'll be able to tell if you're intoxicated,
if you're drunk,
if you're on pot,

1384
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:43.460
whatever,
they'll,
they'll be able to scan.
Oh yeah.

1385
01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:47.810
Well that's what it is.
This lack of privacy is no longer a problem,

1386
01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:52.820
but it's now reality.
It's,
it's,
it's slowly changing from,
you know,

1387
01:18:52.821 --> 01:18:56.330
like what are we going to do when the government can read your email?
Two,

1388
01:18:56.331 --> 01:18:59.000
everyone's going to be able to read your email.
You know,
it's,

1389
01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:02.840
there's not going to be any information that you can share or that you can hide.

1390
01:19:02.841 --> 01:19:03.530
Rather,

1391
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:07.730
it's going to get to a point where every thought that you ever have is able to

1392
01:19:07.731 --> 01:19:10.940
be accessed.
It's going to be ones and Zeros at the brick in the wall.

1393
01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:14.420
It's going to finally reached the convergence.

1394
01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:18.590
That's the real technological singularity,
right?
The idea that we all converge,

1395
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:21.283
but not,
not,

1396
01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:26.150
not with some something malicious bad parent running the fucking show like,

1397
01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:30.860
well,
like we have right now.
Yeah.
We gotta figure that out.
That's,
that's got,
uh,

1398
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:31.221
they've,

1399
01:19:31.221 --> 01:19:35.390
they have to catch the fuck up because the only reason why there are malicious

1400
01:19:35.391 --> 01:19:38.180
parents,
cause they're ignorant.
They haven't had those experiences,

1401
01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:41.510
which is why I've said before like you should never be a fucking president or

1402
01:19:41.511 --> 01:19:45.200
any kind of leader unless you've had a massive psychedelic experience.

1403
01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:49.580
People say that.
That's ridiculous.
I mean to the uninitiated,
me saying that,

1404
01:19:49.581 --> 01:19:53.840
it's like,
oh that's rogue and being silly.
You know,
he's just talking nonsense.

1405
01:19:53.841 --> 01:19:57.530
The fucking cage fighting commentator electric stream shit.
No,

1406
01:19:57.540 --> 01:19:59.330
but no rationally you like,

1407
01:19:59.331 --> 01:20:04.160
who the fuck are you to try to change the world once you haven't improved the

1408
01:20:04.161 --> 01:20:04.610
world?

1409
01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:07.420
You don't even think that you're going to just keep playing the same stupid.

1410
01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:07.980
See what

1411
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.740
<v 0>the fucking dragon has to say about indefinite detention.</v>

1412
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:15.830
And we do love to see Barack Obama just a fucking hut filled with Barack Obama,

1413
01:20:16.321 --> 01:20:18.360
George Bush Jr George Bush,

1414
01:20:18.361 --> 01:20:22.940
Sr Wolfowitz Rumsfeld and there were all Iowasca isn't it?

1415
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.870
They would be puking out little fucking demon.
I'd rather see my next,

1416
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:29.950
yeah,
what a nice thing that I got.
I mean,

1417
01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:32.940
there'll be nice to each other for a few hours and they have headaches and

1418
01:20:32.941 --> 01:20:37.500
fucking knew somebody for it.
Then the Serotonin all deplete themselves.

1419
01:20:38.370 --> 01:20:42.330
More cranky than ever.
But if you got them on like a real session of five,

1420
01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.940
five or six session,
month long journey,

1421
01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:50.430
take a leave them out there and at the end of it,
how do you feel Mr Wolfowitz?

1422
01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:54.960
Yeah.
Just thinking about all the millions of desks they've caused,

1423
01:20:54.961 --> 01:20:58.670
it could have been avoided.
All the babies their rack with no,

1424
01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.840
they may not come back from the jungle.

1425
01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:03.870
They may feel like they just fucking can't.

1426
01:21:04.050 --> 01:21:06.150
They're going to go for a walk until a Jaguar get some.

1427
01:21:06.170 --> 01:21:09.770
It's it sacrifice himself in a Jaguar.
I probably wouldn't get Dick Cheney.

1428
01:21:10.210 --> 01:21:15.210
Am I gonna do with this old motherfucker Jaguar people that are that old.

1429
01:21:15.781 --> 01:21:20.460
Yeah.
This is poison old cheeseburger.
Eaton Douche bag probably smells like ass.

1430
01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:23.720
Imagine a lot of the bad smells to a Jaguar.
Yeah.

1431
01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:26.100
Couldn't be good on his second heart

1432
01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:32.610
became as would get them fuck came will eat anything.
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1433
01:21:32.611 --> 01:21:36.660
they will,
right?
Yeah.
They don't get that bag though,
dude.
They're not too big.

1434
01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:40.590
How big is that?
They're not that scary day.
They can get like 10 feet,
10 feet,

1435
01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:44.580
10 feet could kill you.
But they're not that.
They're not that aggressive.

1436
01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:47.030
They're not like crocodile than not like the crocs.

1437
01:21:48.230 --> 01:21:50.190
It's weird how parts of the world,

1438
01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:53.550
like some parts just developed too much cattle.

1439
01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:56.940
The develop too many onion animals,
too many hooved animals.
And they're like,

1440
01:21:56.941 --> 01:21:58.870
all right,
bring in the monsters.

1441
01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:03.060
I'm going to get the monsters have to chase down these 50 mile an hour running

1442
01:22:03.061 --> 01:22:05.520
cows and kill these fucking things.
I mean,

1443
01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:10.500
everywhere you look that has too many cows.
Too many,
too many,
whatever it is.

1444
01:22:10.501 --> 01:22:14.610
Whether it's antelope or water buffalo,
there's crocodiles,
there's Willdabeast,

1445
01:22:14.611 --> 01:22:18.590
there's crocodiles,
there's lions is,
it's all like,

1446
01:22:18.630 --> 01:22:23.490
it's almost like nature.
Go stop.
Just does she fuck you fucking cunts.

1447
01:22:23.491 --> 01:22:27.080
He won't stop being stopped.
Fucking eating grass.
All right.
All right.

1448
01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.970
Bring it in and send the monsters.
But in,
you know,

1449
01:22:29.971 --> 01:22:32.790
in the Amazon there's no cattle,
you know,

1450
01:22:32.791 --> 01:22:35.520
so they're like cam little crocodiles,
little ones.

1451
01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:40.320
Will Caymans snaking clean up the fish snakes.
We don't,

1452
01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:44.280
we don't have like herds of cattle wandering through the fall rain forest.

1453
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:48.120
But you have to minimize,
no,
there is a very,

1454
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:51.600
you do get a very balanced sense,
you know like black at nature.

1455
01:22:51.601 --> 01:22:54.090
Got It right there.
When you're in the jungle,
you know,

1456
01:22:54.091 --> 01:22:58.350
like every inch is covered in life and the life is all kinds of working
together.

1457
01:22:58.351 --> 01:23:01.050
It's pretty,
it's a pretty cool feeling.
Sad as fuck.

1458
01:23:01.051 --> 01:23:04.250
When you fly over the areas that have been chewed up,
we,

1459
01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:08.410
we into Brazil and there's areas we fly over,
we can see where they've uh,

1460
01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:12.910
chopped down big swaths of the rain forest and it's like wow,

1461
01:23:12.911 --> 01:23:15.370
that's no joke.
Like that's a lot.
Like they,

1462
01:23:15.371 --> 01:23:17.740
they've cut a lot of fucking trees down man.

1463
01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:22.330
And that rain forest is not growing back where they cut it down.
I mean it's not,

1464
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:25.720
it doesn't grow back there.
It doesn't,
it dries up and that's it.

1465
01:23:25.721 --> 01:23:29.800
It needs the more,
I mean it's like a self sustaining sort of an environment.

1466
01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.960
The rain forest is and when you chop it down,

1467
01:23:31.961 --> 01:23:33.400
it's not like it just builds back up.

1468
01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:37.900
Now that ground gets dry there cause it's constantly exposed to the sun.

1469
01:23:37.901 --> 01:23:41.800
It changes everything.
It changes the whole ballgame.
It's really a,

1470
01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:44.110
it's really sad.
It's really kind of fucked up.

1471
01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:46.030
How many years would it take to grow that back?

1472
01:23:46.031 --> 01:23:49.660
Eventually we'd grow back it seven and it would it eventually?
I mean,

1473
01:23:49.661 --> 01:23:52.570
what did they go?
Well I don't know if it would,
I mean I think,

1474
01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:56.890
you know where the Nile Valley is used to be at one point in time.
A rain forest.

1475
01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.410
Yeah.
This would be the last look at it now.
It didn't grow back.

1476
01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:04.030
It became fucking sand desert weather patterns might add something to do with

1477
01:24:04.031 --> 01:24:04.241
that,

1478
01:24:04.241 --> 01:24:09.241
but I was watching a fucked up documentary on the and talls that may or may not

1479
01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:13.900
be bullshit.
Seems like it's bullshit.
According to a lot of these,
uh,

1480
01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:17.230
science people have debunked it,
but it's really cool.

1481
01:24:17.231 --> 01:24:21.060
It's too bad that it's bullshit because the,
uh,

1482
01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:25.870
he wrote this thing about neanderthals,
uh,
that we sort of,

1483
01:24:25.871 --> 01:24:28.930
um,
I think the word is anthropomorphize.
You,
uh,

1484
01:24:29.170 --> 01:24:33.330
sort of give animals human characteristics,
right.
And,
uh,

1485
01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:37.360
he compares a human skull and the Anatol Scott,

1486
01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:40.470
it's really fascinating that,
that,
first of all,
you know,
we,

1487
01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:42.670
we've seen images of neanderthals.

1488
01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:46.990
They always looked like people kind of caveman.
Yeah,
exactly.

1489
01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:49.330
But just like Ari on a bad day.

1490
01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:53.590
But we're very different looking than neanderthals.

1491
01:24:53.591 --> 01:24:56.760
Neanderthals have much larger eyes and they're much higher on her head.

1492
01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:59.450
They're like,
where our forehead is.
Yeah.
It's weird.
There.
Look,

1493
01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:02.710
they would look weird as fuck.
If you saw a neanderthal in front of you,

1494
01:25:02.711 --> 01:25:06.430
it wouldn't be like,
oh,
there's a dude,
you know,
that's on his way to the movies.

1495
01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:10.420
He'd be like,
what the fuck is going on there?
Right.
And this guy made them out.

1496
01:25:10.421 --> 01:25:12.220
Like the other thing is that,
um,
you know,

1497
01:25:12.221 --> 01:25:14.770
we always assume they have white skin and uh,

1498
01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:19.420
he made versions of them like a artificial version of where they had black skin

1499
01:25:19.421 --> 01:25:22.750
like a gorilla and they were super muscular and you know,

1500
01:25:22.751 --> 01:25:24.460
his ideas that it was a,

1501
01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:29.520
we were at war with neanderthals until the intelligent humans figured out how

1502
01:25:30.281 --> 01:25:32.920
to,
uh,
how to overcome them.
But like,

1503
01:25:32.921 --> 01:25:37.921
look at one of the images is this mother fucker put up his idea of what a,

1504
01:25:37.991 --> 01:25:41.710
a neanderthal face would look like.
Yeah.
And he's like,

1505
01:25:41.711 --> 01:25:44.620
they would have big like slit eyes like a cat.

1506
01:25:44.770 --> 01:25:48.820
So they could see at night their eyes were much larger than ours and they were

1507
01:25:48.821 --> 01:25:51.800
using tools and they were intelligent and they probably hunted out.

1508
01:25:51.801 --> 01:25:54.580
It's like Avatar.
It looks fucking fat ass.

1509
01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:59.890
But apparently there's very little little to support this guy's theories and

1510
01:26:01.301 --> 01:26:04.430
it's,
he's most likely gone silly

1511
01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:08.600
<v 2>and went like super sensationalist with all this.
But uh,</v>

1512
01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:13.490
it is kind of cool.
Was a terminal chain of its own in evolutionary,

1513
01:26:13.491 --> 01:26:14.390
like the branch.

1514
01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:18.290
Then apps that created homosapiens happened earlier and then neanderthals with

1515
01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:20.120
some terminal node that died out.
Right.

1516
01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:23.750
Well they would want both from neanderthals.
Anything.
Exactly.
Well,

1517
01:26:23.751 --> 01:26:27.200
we will see it's,
I dunno,
it's all very sketchy,

1518
01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:31.010
but neanderthals evolved in Europe.
Homosapiens evolved in Africa.

1519
01:26:31.130 --> 01:26:31.963
That's what we know.

1520
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:36.290
But we also know that a lot of people have a certain percentage of neanderthals

1521
01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:38.750
in them,
so we don't know what happened there,

1522
01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:43.780
whether we fuck them or they fly us or both or both.

1523
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:46.010
But if they looked like this,

1524
01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:50.060
it would be pretty freaky if they're really did look like giant gorillas.

1525
01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.250
How many people wanted to fuck the blue avatar chick?

1526
01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:55.190
I mean people went there first.
They're a big crazy blue bedroom.

1527
01:26:55.610 --> 01:27:00.400
Especially if you could be in that big blue body being dude's body.

1528
01:27:00.401 --> 01:27:04.460
She was sexy man.
Something about us.
The NAVI.

1529
01:27:05.210 --> 01:27:05.540
Yeah.

1530
01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:10.250
How many people got depressed after they saw that movie and wanting to live in

1531
01:27:10.251 --> 01:27:14.270
the avatar world?
No where that is.
It was definitely,

1532
01:27:14.271 --> 01:27:17.120
I did look down with,
but that was like a real issue with people.

1533
01:27:17.121 --> 01:27:20.380
They've got an Avatar depressure sure.
We still long for that.

1534
01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:24.820
That sort of noble hunter gatherer existence,
you know,

1535
01:27:24.821 --> 01:27:28.280
and we still want it and that and the connectedness,
the sense of tribe.

1536
01:27:28.281 --> 01:27:31.470
We have a,
we have no fucking sense of tribe anymore.
I really,
you know,

1537
01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.380
we're so just as a tribe,

1538
01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:36.800
as we get a couple of friends and we don't even live near each other,

1539
01:27:36.801 --> 01:27:39.260
he has to drive a fucking,
I see him four days a week.

1540
01:27:39.261 --> 01:27:43.910
He'd tribes like an hour to get here.
Yeah,
exactly.
Imagine if you had a walk.

1541
01:27:43.911 --> 01:27:47.580
We're nowhere near our friends and that's,
and that's so,
you know,

1542
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:50.990
I think that's so important and so much of what's what's missing and allows

1543
01:27:50.991 --> 01:27:54.170
people to get so fucking off.
I saw it,
I was just going,

1544
01:27:54.171 --> 01:27:57.590
I was walking through a TV and I hate seeing local new shit.

1545
01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:01.250
And it talked about some dude who had his wife like chained up and was like

1546
01:28:01.251 --> 01:28:03.650
beating her with the hot frying pan.
And I'm like,

1547
01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:08.570
Oh fuck eight hearing that it makes me so mad.
But I'm thinking like,
you know,

1548
01:28:08.571 --> 01:28:09.710
if there was a tribe,

1549
01:28:09.711 --> 01:28:14.360
if that meant that only exists because he was allowed to live out on a farm and

1550
01:28:14.361 --> 01:28:17.750
nobody fucking checked on him.
But if you were in a try,
that shit doesn't happen.

1551
01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:20.630
You know?
It's like,
where's your wife?
I haven't seen it for 10 years.
You know,

1552
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:25.460
you're fucking hissing and screaming like you can't you,

1553
01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:28.610
there's a some kind of stuff the tribe would have taken care of.
That guy,

1554
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:32.210
you know,
had been like,
you are fucking sick.
Dot.
Go back to the source.

1555
01:28:32.211 --> 01:28:36.080
Like you're done,
you're done.
You know?
And,
and that just doesn't happen.

1556
01:28:36.081 --> 01:28:39.510
There's no kind of,
and that's an extreme example.
I mean,

1557
01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:43.700
easier examples are the people who were bummed out and depressed and can't talk

1558
01:28:43.701 --> 01:28:46.640
to anybody or can't do anything or can't have that social contact.

1559
01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.140
I saw something else on that.

1560
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:51.980
I think it's dissimilar.com site where this woman started a,

1561
01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:57.260
a service where she's charging like $60 to snuggle for like an hour,

1562
01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:59.870
you know?
And,
and like a New Yorker.
So you're going to get raped.

1563
01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:06.510
People are so fucking isolated from other human contact that it's seriously

1564
01:29:06.511 --> 01:29:10.980
depressing state dollars to snuggle,
snuggle,
want that snuggling.

1565
01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:15.600
Some people need it mad.
She's teasing.
If she's hard to do it,

1566
01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.280
60 bucks,
of course you would do it,
but you would try to fucker.

1567
01:29:18.850 --> 01:29:19.980
Maybe you see this bullshit.

1568
01:29:19.981 --> 01:29:22.950
Maybe they're hookers currently just with maybe going,
but I know,

1569
01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:24.140
I know that I put out a cop,

1570
01:29:24.141 --> 01:29:27.780
like if you take a baby monkey away from the human contact of the,

1571
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:31.080
of the mother monkey,
you know the big can't like hug up on it.

1572
01:29:31.081 --> 01:29:34.020
They've done studies about that and the monkey gets fucked up.

1573
01:29:34.050 --> 01:29:37.230
It's like a terrifying,
it's all fucking whacked out.
Yeah.
You know,

1574
01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:41.790
I think a certain amount of contact and interaction is what our species is made

1575
01:29:41.791 --> 01:29:46.050
for.
And isn't it ironic that the larger the species group gets,

1576
01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:49.680
the less contact it has with each other?
I mean,

1577
01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:52.860
you would think that there's 300 million of us fog would be interacting with

1578
01:29:52.861 --> 01:29:53.310
each other at all.

1579
01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:55.320
<v 3>They long constantly never get away from each other.</v>

1580
01:29:55.650 --> 01:29:59.880
It's almost like the technology is trying to bring us closer to a tribe.

1581
01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:04.860
Technology by dissolving secrets in boundaries is trying to bring this gigantic

1582
01:30:04.861 --> 01:30:09.450
group back together again as one,
as as one individual unit,

1583
01:30:09.451 --> 01:30:10.284
like a tribe.

1584
01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:15.740
<v 2>But I think that there's a weird problem that we have with the fact that</v>

1585
01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:21.900
technology is just fucking taking off faster than our biology can catch up to.

1586
01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:23.620
I agree.
I agree.

1587
01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:24.900
<v 3>You know,
and I don't,
I don't,</v>

1588
01:30:24.930 --> 01:30:28.920
I think it's real hard for people to be happy in the reality of today's world

1589
01:30:28.921 --> 01:30:33.600
because just physiologically,
well first of all,
monogamy,
you know,

1590
01:30:33.601 --> 01:30:36.900
how many people struggle with monogamy?
How many people struggle with,
uh,

1591
01:30:37.170 --> 01:30:41.040
you know,
the idea of a,
the responsibility of being a parent.

1592
01:30:41.041 --> 01:30:43.500
How many people struggle with the idea of the,
you know,

1593
01:30:43.501 --> 01:30:48.390
the fact that you have to sustain some sort of a living in existence.
It's,

1594
01:30:48.391 --> 01:30:50.520
it all seems like something you don't want to do,

1595
01:30:50.970 --> 01:30:54.570
but yet this is what everybody's doing.
Everybody's getting the house and paint.

1596
01:30:54.571 --> 01:30:58.230
You got 30 year commitment to pay x amount a month and you've got to work or

1597
01:30:58.231 --> 01:31:00.720
they're fucking take all your,
your house away and everything get paid,

1598
01:31:00.721 --> 01:31:03.640
we'll go to nothing and you're fucking doomed.
I mean,

1599
01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:07.590
you look at the way a lot of people are forced to live this life.

1600
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:10.980
It's so completely and totally unnatural,

1601
01:31:11.010 --> 01:31:15.510
but so completely an obviously designed to keep this machine moving in the same

1602
01:31:15.511 --> 01:31:20.130
direction because you keep this machine mass producing technology,

1603
01:31:20.370 --> 01:31:25.110
mass producing innovation and moving at faster and faster and further and

1604
01:31:25.111 --> 01:31:25.471
further.

1605
01:31:25.471 --> 01:31:29.940
I mean that ultimately everybody's like a little worker bee trying to push their

1606
01:31:29.941 --> 01:31:31.920
segment of technology further.

1607
01:31:32.110 --> 01:31:36.430
<v 2>Yeah.
But it's the content starting to reject it.
You know what I mean?</v>

1608
01:31:36.431 --> 01:31:37.660
You're starting to see the casual,

1609
01:31:37.810 --> 01:31:39.940
the casualties have been around for a long time.

1610
01:31:39.970 --> 01:31:43.660
He's filled those with antidepressants.
Yeah.
Keep them in the system,

1611
01:31:43.661 --> 01:31:44.321
keep him going.

1612
01:31:44.321 --> 01:31:47.110
But at a certain point people are going to get fucking fed up again.

1613
01:31:47.170 --> 01:31:51.040
And I think that's maybe what this whole change in consciousness that people are

1614
01:31:51.041 --> 01:31:54.400
talking about.
I think that enough.
I think that actually may be real.

1615
01:31:54.401 --> 01:31:56.710
I don't know if it has anything to do with what the mines were talking about,

1616
01:31:56.711 --> 01:32:00.130
but you can kind of sense something different now.
Well,

1617
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:01.490
<v 3>I think just the fact that we're,</v>

1618
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:05.980
we've been bombarded with truth for the past,
you know,

1619
01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.250
who knows how many years now.
Yeah.

1620
01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:13.260
We're constantly bombarded with reality and information and this is just such a

1621
01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:17.020
strange time where there's no running from reality.

1622
01:32:17.290 --> 01:32:21.040
Whereas before people could just sort of live in the dark or go super religious

1623
01:32:21.041 --> 01:32:21.700
or you know,

1624
01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:26.700
they could block themselves off to giant chunks of what really makes the world

1625
01:32:27.191 --> 01:32:29.630
tick.
Can't do that anymore.
Now it's,

1626
01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:32.770
it's all sorts of people are becoming too empowered.
They're too,

1627
01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:37.940
too filled with information to aware and it's slowly starting to see how it's

1628
01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:40.960
balancing itself out in the financial world.

1629
01:32:40.961 --> 01:32:43.060
Like people are going to jail like crazy.
Yeah.

1630
01:32:43.630 --> 01:32:45.550
Lawsuits are coming down like crazy.
There's it,

1631
01:32:45.551 --> 01:32:50.200
you can't hide information the way it used to.
You couldn't,
that Bernie Madoff,

1632
01:32:50.201 --> 01:32:50.831
dude,
that guy,

1633
01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:54.880
that guy could have rock that shit for a hundred years back in 1910 you know,

1634
01:32:54.881 --> 01:32:59.130
and he could a rock that shit until the wheels fell off and no one would've

1635
01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:02.890
suspected it.
Common.
But in this world and today's Day and age,

1636
01:33:02.891 --> 01:33:04.870
it's like it's not that easy.
Yeah.

1637
01:33:05.850 --> 01:33:07.680
<v 2>Yeah.
It'll be interesting to see which way it goes.</v>

1638
01:33:07.681 --> 01:33:08.800
I think there is a yearning said,

1639
01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:11.370
I don't know if he could've rocked that shit in 1910 I think.

1640
01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:14.350
I mean they would have probably caught him either way.
I don't think that,

1641
01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:20.730
I think there's a yearning to get back to that kind of community sense.
I mean,

1642
01:33:20.731 --> 01:33:24.120
as you said,
while you can connect with a massive amount of people online,

1643
01:33:24.330 --> 01:33:29.330
I mean so much of the interaction is also pretty fucked up too.
You know,

1644
01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:35.190
and it,
you feel,
it's not like interacting with a real person where that,

1645
01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:38.390
where you would never say that to another person because you would see him a,

1646
01:33:38.490 --> 01:33:40.260
even if you were stronger and could kick their ass,

1647
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:44.160
you would see him get sad and there would be like,
you'd feel bad hopefully,

1648
01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:47.190
unless you're just a fucking total monster.
But you know,

1649
01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:51.790
there's this check and balance of real interaction versus cyber interaction that

1650
01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:55.170
yeah.
Feelings that you get from talking to people.

1651
01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:59.780
<v 3>You can just anonymize and honesty and lash out at someone with no repercussions</v>

1652
01:33:59.781 --> 01:34:00.600
whatsoever.

1653
01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:03.450
<v 2>Yeah.
Have you been to the county fair?
That's all it's about.
You know,</v>

1654
01:34:03.451 --> 01:34:08.130
there were so many fucking people out.
It's just stupid people out there,

1655
01:34:08.190 --> 01:34:12.410
you know,
and you really see it.
Yeah.
Like if you go to like a hometown,

1656
01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:13.770
Midwest County Fair

1657
01:34:14.670 --> 01:34:17.760
<v 3>people just having fun,
man,
there's going to be a few decades.</v>

1658
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:21.320
But whenever you get large gatherings of people,
there's always a few decades,

1659
01:34:21.330 --> 01:34:22.170
but that's not most of them.

1660
01:34:22.170 --> 01:34:26.640
<v 2>Peop uh,
go to the county fair in Ohio,
because Ohio is a different world.</v>

1661
01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:29.340
It wasn't totally a different world in Los Angeles,

1662
01:34:29.610 --> 01:34:32.940
but how was it a different world as far as the county fair?
It's just,

1663
01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:34.440
just go there,
I guess.

1664
01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:38.670
It's just awful in a few rodeos and they're pretty friendly people.
Yeah.

1665
01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:42.720
What do you experience the dumbness,

1666
01:34:42.730 --> 01:34:47.730
the caveman type species that lives in certain areas of the United States where

1667
01:34:50.131 --> 01:34:52.590
your soul,
Ohio was mostly audience?
Is that what we're saying?

1668
01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:54.560
There's a lot of them.
There's was a lot of them.

1669
01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:57.850
So when you go to a state fair in Ohio,
you think you'd just seen a lot it cause,

1670
01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:58.580
I mean

1671
01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:01.910
<v 0>there might be Columbus,
there might be Cleveland and there might be Cincinnati,</v>

1672
01:35:01.911 --> 01:35:05.500
but there's a whole lot of other space around those areas that you are like,
Oh,

1673
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:08.650
who lives here?
I think the majority,
at least 80% of them are cool.

1674
01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:09.401
I think you're just,

1675
01:35:09.401 --> 01:35:14.020
you're dealing with a small group of loud people that you know come a problem

1676
01:35:14.021 --> 01:35:16.600
almost everywhere.
And a lot of them are fucking,

1677
01:35:16.601 --> 01:35:20.770
probably what I'm saying though is the hawks and hate their life.

1678
01:35:20.771 --> 01:35:24.710
And what I'm saying though is that if you see these people that are just idiots

1679
01:35:24.711 --> 01:35:28.760
and retarded on online that are just yelling out con fuck blah blah,

1680
01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.210
those are the same people that you see.
You know the worst,
the worst.

1681
01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:35.330
You see those people in real life too.
You just never see them.

1682
01:35:35.331 --> 01:35:36.650
Cause we're here in Los Angeles.

1683
01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:39.630
Well not just that because you avoid them because you've got a good social

1684
01:35:39.631 --> 01:35:40.680
circle,
you know,

1685
01:35:40.681 --> 01:35:43.950
you know where to go and where not to go and every now and then it crosses over

1686
01:35:43.951 --> 01:35:47.630
and you wind up hanging out with,
some morons are getting stuck with some morons.

1687
01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.460
That's why I fucking wish that the states had full autonomy because I think you

1688
01:35:51.461 --> 01:35:55.050
would start to actually at that point where federal government could give up the

1689
01:35:55.051 --> 01:35:58.680
states,
could make cool enough laws and have a cool enough system built together,

1690
01:35:58.770 --> 01:36:01.370
kick counts out.
Well they would,
you know,

1691
01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:04.180
people would be attracted the right people,
you know,

1692
01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:08.130
they could be like a message board.
Just band people in real life.

1693
01:36:08.170 --> 01:36:11.790
Like that sense of tribe I think would come back.
You know,

1694
01:36:11.791 --> 01:36:15.450
there'd be a unity between the governing body and the people and they would be

1695
01:36:15.451 --> 01:36:20.220
like,
I fucking love my state.
Like not just from some strange patriotic pride,

1696
01:36:20.221 --> 01:36:21.640
like yeah,
you don't mess with Texas.

1697
01:36:22.210 --> 01:36:26.730
Eventually you're going to be able to walk up to someone and in like mouse over

1698
01:36:26.731 --> 01:36:27.420
them,

1699
01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:30.240
you'd be able to like put your cursor over them and you'll be able to read all

1700
01:36:30.241 --> 01:36:33.220
their information.
Hopefully that he would like lying motherfuckers.

1701
01:36:34.110 --> 01:36:37.230
Hopefully we'll have Yelp for people and you'll just see,
oh,

1702
01:36:37.231 --> 01:36:40.320
Aubrey has five stars.
He's a really cool guy.
We could take him anywhere.

1703
01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.280
And we still,
a California is only letting fivestar people in.

1704
01:36:44.010 --> 01:36:47.370
If you're a Douche bag,
you can't go.
And you know,
and this guy shows up.

1705
01:36:47.371 --> 01:36:51.550
Well I'm fucking good crews,
Jude.
I'm a good guy.
As long as you're not,
again,

1706
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:54.620
trying to get mad.
And you see he's got two stars.
Like come on,

1707
01:36:54.970 --> 01:36:58.120
there's people on Yelp that,
I don't know how they got on there,

1708
01:36:58.121 --> 01:37:02.470
but there's people on Yelp and there were people revealing people like as if

1709
01:37:02.471 --> 01:37:05.920
they were a business.
But there's people on it.
Oh,
that's funny.

1710
01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:08.560
I haven't checked to see if I was on there,
but,
well,

1711
01:37:08.561 --> 01:37:11.770
you should be able to review the person that's reviewing and this the person

1712
01:37:11.771 --> 01:37:14.440
reviewing only us two stars.
You shouldn't,

1713
01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:17.890
you shouldn't count on like when she's a con.
Look,
of course she hates me.

1714
01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:22.410
She hates herself.
She hates everybody.
Can't category.
Speaking of hate ever Mao,

1715
01:37:22.450 --> 01:37:24.550
everybody would just fucking cheat that system.

1716
01:37:24.551 --> 01:37:26.260
Do you know this Daniel Tosh situation?

1717
01:37:26.261 --> 01:37:28.540
Do you know what happened with Daniel and I talked about it?
Yeah.

1718
01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:33.250
We didn't talk about this and this is what's hilarious is a woman wrote a blog

1719
01:37:33.251 --> 01:37:37.730
about this.
She wrote,
she's Tosh 2.0 or whatever.
That guy.
Yeah,
he's,

1720
01:37:37.731 --> 01:37:39.940
he's getting in trouble for this.
He's forced to apologize.

1721
01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:43.090
This asshole and this woman wrote a blog about it.

1722
01:37:43.091 --> 01:37:46.420
It completely delusional blog.
By the way.

1723
01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:51.190
He's asking this is what Daniel Tosh did.
He asked.

1724
01:37:52.660 --> 01:37:57.150
He asked what is,
she said,
oh,

1725
01:37:57.151 --> 01:37:58.590
I would find it.
This is Daniel Tosh.

1726
01:37:58.591 --> 01:38:03.030
The time I thought he was just some Yahoo who somehow got a Gig on after cook.

1727
01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:07.230
I honestly thought he was an amateur because he didn't seem that comfortable on

1728
01:38:07.231 --> 01:38:10.530
stage and seem to have really awkward presence.

1729
01:38:11.130 --> 01:38:15.300
Fucking useless fucking idiot writing a blog.

1730
01:38:15.301 --> 01:38:19.000
Anybody can write a blog.
So this,
this dummy Patosh is,
um,

1731
01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:24.000
asking people like to throw out questions so they,
they're throwing out,

1732
01:38:24.001 --> 01:38:27.270
you know what,
what should I talk about?
And someone says rape.
And he goes,

1733
01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:32.250
Oh yeah,
rape.
That's really funny.
Yeah.
What's funny about that?
The humiliation.

1734
01:38:32.251 --> 01:38:35.100
The violence.
You know,
he's like saying ranting on things.

1735
01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:39.000
The reason why rape isn't fun,
right?
And so some woman yells out,

1736
01:38:40.530 --> 01:38:45.360
actually rape jokes are never funny.
This,
this dump cunt that wrote this blog.

1737
01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:47.160
You also this out.
So he says,

1738
01:38:47.250 --> 01:38:49.950
wouldn't it be funny if you got raped by like five people right now?

1739
01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:53.400
Which is really funny.
You know,
he doesn't really mean that.

1740
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:57.750
What he's trying to do is he's riffing and you're interrupting with some self

1741
01:38:57.751 --> 01:39:01.050
righteous horse shit.
Oh,
oh,
you're saying that rape is bad?

1742
01:39:01.110 --> 01:39:05.520
Is that what you're saying?
Oh Jesus,
you're at a fucking comedy club.
You asshole.

1743
01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:07.350
And this woman writes this,

1744
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:12.500
she writes this whole fucking rambling self serving article about this and now

1745
01:39:12.751 --> 01:39:16.740
because of that,
he had to apologize for her because you joked around about rape.

1746
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:19.980
Yup.
That's raper.

1747
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:24.750
Well she's going to get her mind raped on the Internet.
I'm sure.

1748
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:29.580
Cause it's so beyond stupid,
you know?
And she's like,
we were shocked.

1749
01:39:29.581 --> 01:39:33.370
We couldn't believe it.
I demand to speak to the manager,
to manage,

1750
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:34.940
speak to the manager is what I said.
We,

1751
01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:36.310
we talked about in the icehouse chronicles,

1752
01:39:36.330 --> 01:39:39.030
she should be fired from ever going to a comedy club again.

1753
01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:40.500
They should take a picture of her.

1754
01:39:40.590 --> 01:39:44.670
And every comedy club in the country should agree that this fucking dummy is no

1755
01:39:44.671 --> 01:39:48.690
longer allowed to go to comedy clubs.
Put a picture of her.
You're not allowed.

1756
01:39:48.691 --> 01:39:53.580
She comes to the door,
blow your rape,
whistle out the agreement.

1757
01:39:53.581 --> 01:39:56.790
When you go to those places to just leave that shit behind you,

1758
01:39:56.791 --> 01:39:57.930
especially the laugh.

1759
01:39:57.931 --> 01:40:01.770
Go there to laugh at the taboos that you think are so sacred that you can't even

1760
01:40:01.771 --> 01:40:05.040
touch them.
You know,
things that you're afraid of,
things that your fears,
death,

1761
01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:07.770
any of this stuff.
You go there,
you laugh,
you talk about it.

1762
01:40:07.771 --> 01:40:11.460
It becomes less serious after that.
I feel more bad for Dane Cook.

1763
01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:15.720
Who has this as a fan?
Poor guy.
Couldn't imagine this being one of your fans.

1764
01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:19.880
Well apparently Dane Cook,
Burt crash,

1765
01:40:19.881 --> 01:40:21.690
it was just joking around and said,

1766
01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:25.380
Dane Cook is going to live tweet while my show was on,
you know,

1767
01:40:25.381 --> 01:40:29.460
just joking around and Dane got so much fucking hate mail,

1768
01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:33.390
like hate tweets right away.
And then Bert crusher started reading them.

1769
01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:38.310
It's a lot of fucking people that hate Dang like there's a lot of negativity

1770
01:40:38.311 --> 01:40:39.840
attached to being that dude.

1771
01:40:40.290 --> 01:40:44.520
And he just got bummed out like it told Bert to please leave them out of this

1772
01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:48.540
hole
when we eat about them.
Like yesterday,

1773
01:40:48.570 --> 01:40:53.130
whenever we show aired.
Yeah.
If you tweet about,
you know,

1774
01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:56.590
Dane is going to just a certain,
for a certain number of people,

1775
01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:58.990
that's a free shot.
You're allowed to attack Dane Cook.

1776
01:40:58.991 --> 01:41:02.590
It's like men Delia and see that poor fuck he is.
Uh,

1777
01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:07.420
he's a fucking doc with concentric circles of various colors.

1778
01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:11.440
The red,
white,
he's the duck with a target on him.
I mean,

1779
01:41:11.441 --> 01:41:15.580
that's what he built his Karma.
Right.
I haven't heard anything that day,

1780
01:41:15.581 --> 01:41:19.420
but need to build a car.
Everyone tweet,
Dane Cook that he has beautiful lips.

1781
01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:24.320
Everyone tweaked Dane Cook that he's a big sweetie.
He's a big cute,
cute her son.

1782
01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:30.580
It's funny that socks man.
I,
you know,
the Twitter is pretty fucked out.
How,

1783
01:41:30.590 --> 01:41:34.360
how that shit can turn on you and just ruin your whole entire day.
Well,

1784
01:41:34.361 --> 01:41:36.580
what's fucked up is that,
you know,

1785
01:41:36.850 --> 01:41:40.240
anybody can sort of be anonymous and you know,
call your,

1786
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:44.080
I mean there's a lot of pictures of on Twitter of fake accounts where it's like

1787
01:41:44.081 --> 01:41:47.170
a hot chick in a bikini and like,
please follow me.

1788
01:41:47.170 --> 01:41:50.800
I'm big fan and like you look at a profile and that's her repeating that over

1789
01:41:50.801 --> 01:41:53.380
and over again.
They were like a business and they'll,

1790
01:41:53.410 --> 01:41:55.930
they'll do that and they'll say,
oh my God,

1791
01:41:55.931 --> 01:41:59.830
I just entered into this amazing contest for a free jet ski or whatever the fuck

1792
01:41:59.831 --> 01:42:01.810
it is.
Yeah,
sure.
You know,
and they,
you know,
there's,

1793
01:42:01.811 --> 01:42:03.280
there's a bunch of people that run,

1794
01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:08.140
like there's this one dude that I know that runs thousands of fake Twitter

1795
01:42:08.141 --> 01:42:11.470
accounts and when he wants to spam something out,

1796
01:42:11.471 --> 01:42:14.830
he spams up the same message on every single Twitter account.

1797
01:42:14.831 --> 01:42:17.890
This is why I found it out.
I went to one,
I went to his,

1798
01:42:17.891 --> 01:42:21.130
cause I knew that he was scamming people.
So I went to his Twitter account.

1799
01:42:21.131 --> 01:42:22.360
I said,
let me look at his tweets.

1800
01:42:22.540 --> 01:42:25.720
And then I looked at some of his tweets were responding to people.
So I was like,

1801
01:42:25.721 --> 01:42:29.050
well what is he responding to you?
And then I would go to the responding page.

1802
01:42:29.051 --> 01:42:30.460
He's responding to himself,

1803
01:42:30.461 --> 01:42:33.220
he's writing the same shit and all these different pages.

1804
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:35.980
They all have the same message.
And then I,
I've,

1805
01:42:35.981 --> 01:42:39.370
I've followed the chain like a few dozen times to like gave up.

1806
01:42:39.550 --> 01:42:42.530
But I just kept finding people and I'd go to the other one.

1807
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:45.520
It was the same thing.
It was the same messages,
all the same tweets.

1808
01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:49.180
And I was like,
I wonder how he has this automated,
is he like a program?

1809
01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:53.050
Is it spammers?
Use it.
When you say certain things,

1810
01:42:53.051 --> 01:42:58.040
like if you say magnet box or whatever you say Toshiba,
they'll,

1811
01:42:58.090 --> 01:43:00.340
you'll suddenly get like pesto cheaper prices in town.

1812
01:43:00.341 --> 01:43:04.330
Click here for more information.
You know a spam from Twitter,
they'll do it.
Yeah.

1813
01:43:04.331 --> 01:43:07.330
There's,
there's robots that just sit there and look for certain keywords and the

1814
01:43:07.331 --> 01:43:10.780
timelines and stuff like that.
You hear?
What did you hear about that?
The most,

1815
01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:12.610
the biggest Russian spam or from a,

1816
01:43:12.611 --> 01:43:16.840
from a few years back is this huge Russian spam or in Russia told him like he

1817
01:43:16.841 --> 01:43:20.830
was somehow operating with them some basic rules so they couldn't go after them

1818
01:43:20.831 --> 01:43:23.680
legally.
So I kept telling him to stop and he was like,

1819
01:43:23.681 --> 01:43:26.680
Oh fuck you guys fucking guys,
whatever.
He was making a shit load of money.

1820
01:43:27.010 --> 01:43:31.030
They found him beaten to death with a computer.
Oh my God.

1821
01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:34.920
You're like,
you can look that up.
But I was like,
alright motherfucker,

1822
01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:37.470
you forget where you're from.
Russia.
Yeah.

1823
01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:42.280
Fuck you up and say fuck you and Russia.

1824
01:43:42.281 --> 01:43:45.070
You better hide beaten to death with his computer.

1825
01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:49.060
They have totally different rules over there for how they deal with Shit.

1826
01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:50.890
You can't just get away with stuff like that.

1827
01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:55.440
I wonder how they deal with hecklers.
I mean they have like Russia,

1828
01:43:55.441 --> 01:43:59.240
the standup comedy,
I don't know.
Probably harshly.

1829
01:43:59.241 --> 01:44:02.750
I had a funny story a stripper was telling me about,

1830
01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.870
she had some Russian stripper friends who she was,

1831
01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:10.070
she was stripping with and some girl something,
something wack happen.

1832
01:44:10.071 --> 01:44:12.620
Like she got in trouble for giving a hand job on the floor,

1833
01:44:12.621 --> 01:44:15.740
the Strip club or something like that.
So she's bawling in the,
in the,

1834
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:19.610
in the room and the Russian stripper goes up to goes,
you want to cry,

1835
01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:21.910
you fucking cry alone.
Get out of here.

1836
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:26.270
Like that's just the bucket and that's just the Russian way,
you know?
It's like,

1837
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:30.100
yeah,
you fucking get your shit together and they're hard,
hard bitches.
Yeah.

1838
01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:33.940
I give 300 jobs at the same time.
One with foot.

1839
01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:39.470
Yeah.
It was still crying and then I send money home to mother Russia.

1840
01:44:41.110 --> 01:44:42.230
Yeah.
Yeah.

1841
01:44:42.230 --> 01:44:46.910
There's a parts of the world that are cold and dark dude living over there.

1842
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:51.140
That's why I have a few friends that have dated Russian chicks and I always feel

1843
01:44:51.141 --> 01:44:53.150
like,
like the,
the getting swindled,

1844
01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:55.220
I always feel like something weird is going on.

1845
01:44:55.221 --> 01:44:58.750
Like there's something mercenary happening here.
There's so fuck,
you know,

1846
01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:04.220
this is a,
I know a guy who's Russian,
who's gay for pay and his boyfriend,

1847
01:45:04.221 --> 01:45:05.120
he's straight,

1848
01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:10.160
but he's this Russian guy and his boyfriend is this a rich gang guy and this

1849
01:45:10.161 --> 01:45:14.450
rich gay guy buys him nice cars,
puts him up in a fat apartment.

1850
01:45:14.630 --> 01:45:18.890
I mean really takes care of this guy and it's so that he has sex with them.

1851
01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:21.500
I don't know what they do blow jobs or whatever.

1852
01:45:21.710 --> 01:45:23.870
I don't know how he rocks the Guy Straight.

1853
01:45:24.290 --> 01:45:26.300
And when I found out about him and I'm like,
damn,

1854
01:45:26.301 --> 01:45:29.180
that motherfucker is like a Russian whore.
He's like,

1855
01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:33.500
he's like a mercenary dude that's willing to suck this old guy's Dick.

1856
01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:35.730
You get the feeling that there's still Ferrari,

1857
01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:38.150
some kind of harshness of life in Russia.

1858
01:45:38.151 --> 01:45:40.400
Like even when you used to see fade or fight,
you know,

1859
01:45:40.401 --> 01:45:43.310
just the kind of calmness that he came out there.

1860
01:45:43.311 --> 01:45:46.190
And when he's imposing physical violence is about the comments,

1861
01:45:46.191 --> 01:45:51.110
like whatever he's been through so much fucking scarier than the giant that he's

1862
01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:54.530
about to fight on the other side of the ring that you mean you get that feeling

1863
01:45:54.531 --> 01:45:56.450
from,
from everybody.
Not everybody,

1864
01:45:56.451 --> 01:45:59.980
but a lot of the people over there like life is so harsh that what,

1865
01:45:59.981 --> 01:46:03.470
what you think would be intimidating.
He's just don't give a fuck.
Yeah,

1866
01:46:03.471 --> 01:46:08.310
they're not really that concerned with fights.
Yeah,
just to fight.
Okay.
Yeah.

1867
01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:12.860
It's still easy.
Did you see his last fight with Pedro Huizar?
I didn't know.

1868
01:46:12.861 --> 01:46:16.580
I miss that.
It was brutal.
It was brutal.
He,

1869
01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:20.290
it's almost too bad that he's retiring now because his standup,

1870
01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:24.250
since he started going to Holland,
his standup has really improved a lot.

1871
01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:25.970
You've got a lot better.
His He,

1872
01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:29.090
he threw some pretty high level shit it Pedro Huizar.
First of all,

1873
01:46:29.091 --> 01:46:31.370
you had Pedro staggered just from the speed.

1874
01:46:31.371 --> 01:46:35.570
He's really fast for a heavyweight cause he's not a big heavyweight.

1875
01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:39.260
He's like two 30 but with a high percentage of body fat.

1876
01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:43.460
If you had him lean,
he would probably be about two oh five,
something like that.

1877
01:46:43.670 --> 01:46:47.870
And so he moves like a two o five pounds,
really fast.

1878
01:46:47.871 --> 01:46:50.250
Two a five pounder.
So he,
his brother

1879
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:54.390
<v 3>was fast as fuck to good hands.
Two brothers a lot bigger though.
He a,</v>

1880
01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:56.160
but he lit Pedro,
his a up man.

1881
01:46:56.161 --> 01:46:59.250
He hit him with a leg kick and then he faked the leg kick and threw like a

1882
01:46:59.251 --> 01:47:03.600
superman hook and cracked him on the jaw and then just unloaded on him on the

1883
01:47:03.601 --> 01:47:06.990
ground.
It's hard to watch man cause page.
Oh his AU is one of those dudes.

1884
01:47:06.991 --> 01:47:09.560
It's been around for a long,
yeah.

1885
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:12.780
If you watched a highlight reel of all the towns,
Pedro,

1886
01:47:12.781 --> 01:47:14.340
his owes had his life turned out.

1887
01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:19.380
It's really hard to watch the Gilbert ival fight the,
you know,

1888
01:47:19.381 --> 01:47:23.460
the Josh Barnett fight.
There's a lot of fights over and over again.
We're Pedro,

1889
01:47:23.461 --> 01:47:26.490
his husband really hit hard,

1890
01:47:26.850 --> 01:47:31.540
really scary knockouts.
I mean,
how many can a man under it's,

1891
01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:36.310
that's where it begs the question.
I don't know.
I don't know.
That's,
that's uh,

1892
01:47:36.690 --> 01:47:40.050
I think a lot of money in a lot of science is trying to figure that out with

1893
01:47:40.051 --> 01:47:41.940
these concussions that they're trying to explore.

1894
01:47:41.970 --> 01:47:45.840
If they can figure out how to fix that,
that'll change the price finding world.

1895
01:47:45.841 --> 01:47:49.080
Totally.
Yeah.
No,
people don't have to worry about brain damage anymore.

1896
01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:52.770
If they can just sort of stick a needle inside your ear and inject some stem

1897
01:47:52.771 --> 01:47:55.660
cells and your brain rejuvenates itself.
Yeah.

1898
01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:59.190
People would just do extra shots though to get smarter.
They'd be like,
fuck,

1899
01:47:59.430 --> 01:48:03.570
Fuck Alpha brain.
I'm going to take a chance on overgrowing my head,

1900
01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:10.270
but what if that backfired?
Turned autistic or something a little scary.
Yeah.

1901
01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:13.230
I wonder if they're going to be able to eventually figure out a way to

1902
01:48:13.231 --> 01:48:16.710
regenerate brain cells because that's a real issue with people with head trauma.

1903
01:48:17.150 --> 01:48:21.030
It's just big parts of your brain just are not the same anymore after massive

1904
01:48:21.031 --> 01:48:21.661
concussions,

1905
01:48:21.661 --> 01:48:25.220
especially if you've had multiple concussions and like football players and

1906
01:48:25.230 --> 01:48:28.590
especially fighters in training.
That's the big one.

1907
01:48:28.591 --> 01:48:33.591
There's a guy who died recently in an unregulated MMA fight and he got triangled

1908
01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:39.540
and a tap from the triangle and was no head trauma at all in the fight.

1909
01:48:39.930 --> 01:48:42.390
Went back to his locker room and uh,

1910
01:48:42.510 --> 01:48:46.980
and was watching some fights and then someone heard some moaning and they looked

1911
01:48:46.981 --> 01:48:49.590
over and he had collapsed and a,

1912
01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:53.040
he wound up dying and they brought him to the hospital.

1913
01:48:53.041 --> 01:48:54.870
And when they did an autopsy on him that he found,

1914
01:48:54.871 --> 01:48:58.350
it was a blunt force trauma from about a week ago.

1915
01:48:59.250 --> 01:49:01.260
So it's something that he had sustained.

1916
01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:04.470
Pretty sure that's what they had decided.
It wasn't from the,

1917
01:49:04.471 --> 01:49:05.470
the fight they were there,

1918
01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:08.670
they were pointing to something that happened in training the week before,

1919
01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:14.410
like Adrenalin,
dehydration,
little bit of a blood restriction track loader.

1920
01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:17.220
Travis Luder fought Marvin Eastman.
Marvin Eastman had getting,

1921
01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:22.020
gotten knocked out twice and training.
He got KOD twice and training.

1922
01:49:22.260 --> 01:49:24.210
And so when Travis connected with them,

1923
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:26.760
it wasn't even like the hardest punched in the world.
It was weird.

1924
01:49:26.761 --> 01:49:30.210
He like caught him on the end of a punch and Marvin just went completely

1925
01:49:30.211 --> 01:49:33.720
unconscious.
Like instantly.
It was like,
Whoa,
what's one of those weird ones?

1926
01:49:34.110 --> 01:49:36.990
Like what's going on there?
Same thing with Forrest Griffin.

1927
01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:38.430
When he fought Anderson Silva,

1928
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:42.960
he had been knocked out twice and training to this.
That's crazy.

1929
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:45.180
Those guys are crazy.
That's crazy.

1930
01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:48.040
You're getting k out twice and then you're to get k out again.

1931
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:51.700
<v 0>I mean it's,
but you know,
you sign up for a fight,
you know,
you sign up,</v>

1932
01:49:51.730 --> 01:49:53.690
you know this is what you're supposed to be doing and you know,

1933
01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:56.800
if you get Keoni and training,
man,
that's just tough shit.
You just,

1934
01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:58.720
you just suck it up and you get out there and fight.

1935
01:49:58.750 --> 01:50:02.050
That's a fine line between having to believe that you're going to win no matter

1936
01:50:02.051 --> 01:50:04.780
what.
And then also being realistic and being like,
yeah,

1937
01:50:04.810 --> 01:50:09.190
I should probably bail on this.
Well very few guys,
no one to bail.

1938
01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:10.660
That's the hardest part.

1939
01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:14.260
The hardest part is knowing when to walk away and everybody wants to walk away

1940
01:50:14.261 --> 01:50:16.270
with a win.
You know,

1941
01:50:16.690 --> 01:50:20.650
the hardest part is figuring out what the fuck to do with your life next.

1942
01:50:20.651 --> 01:50:22.780
Cause when a guy is trying to be a fighter,

1943
01:50:22.781 --> 01:50:24.700
he really doesn't have a whole lot of options.

1944
01:50:24.730 --> 01:50:27.370
I mean these you're doing one thing,
you know,

1945
01:50:27.371 --> 01:50:30.280
and while you're doing that one thing,
that's all you can concentrate on,

1946
01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:32.350
it's going to be your whole life period.

1947
01:50:32.590 --> 01:50:35.080
And then all of a sudden it's not your life anymore.

1948
01:50:35.290 --> 01:50:39.230
Now you got to find something else.
You also got to match that excitement level.

1949
01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:41.380
I mean,
how are you going to do that?

1950
01:50:41.381 --> 01:50:46.240
This is the most amazing spectacle on the earth.
You know,
you versus another man,

1951
01:50:46.241 --> 01:50:50.110
while millions watched and you know,
the triumph and all of those emotions.

1952
01:50:50.111 --> 01:50:52.060
I mean you'll never be able to duplicate that.

1953
01:50:52.450 --> 01:50:56.700
It's almost impossible unless you become like some crazy downhill skier dudes.

1954
01:50:56.710 --> 01:50:59.320
Would he drop you off of a helicopter here?
Yeah,

1955
01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:01.870
those guys are on their fucking minds.
It was that.

1956
01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:06.010
How long ago did you do your recent,
uh,
this recent trip?

1957
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:10.650
Like how was it months ago or weeks ago or a,
it was like a two way.

1958
01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:14.290
I talked,
I talked to Bob about it already.
They don't have it up yet.

1959
01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:18.250
So they were asking me.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Okay.
Oh,
I'll just tell you folks,

1960
01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:21.100
we're doing a show Wednesday night.
Nice House,
10:00 PM main room.

1961
01:51:21.250 --> 01:51:24.060
Big Room tickets will be on the side.

1962
01:51:24.630 --> 01:51:28.130
Ari's already have anything Wednesday night.
I don't know.
Um,

1963
01:51:28.270 --> 01:51:30.520
definitely me and definitely Brian,

1964
01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:34.810
we're going to be in Calgary this week to not you,
Brian doesn't,

1965
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:37.830
I don't go to Canada.
You never take me to Canada.
Do you want to come to Canada?

1966
01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:41.950
Fill up next time I go to Vancouver,
you're coming.
Um,

1967
01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:46.980
but we're doing the Jack Singer concert hall in Calgary and first show sold out,

1968
01:51:47.171 --> 01:51:50.530
but we're doing a second show and that's almost sold out.
But uh,

1969
01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:53.200
some tickets are available for the second show.
It's me,

1970
01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:57.370
Duncan Trussell and Ari Shaffir and that's this Friday night.

1971
01:51:57.550 --> 01:51:58.630
So it is a,

1972
01:51:58.870 --> 01:52:02.680
it's about as close to death squad as you can get without Joey Diaz and Brian.

1973
01:52:03.970 --> 01:52:06.320
But Joey Diaz is not going to make it to camp.

1974
01:52:06.910 --> 01:52:10.150
And that is very cocksucker very strict laws about criminals.

1975
01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:14.380
And when you got kidnapping with firearms,
yeah.

1976
01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:19.060
They're like,
I know it was a long time ago,
Joey.
He's like,
listen,

1977
01:52:19.061 --> 01:52:23.500
I'm a different guy now.
I got 11 cats.
Come on.
They won't let them in.

1978
01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:26.440
So I'm sorry.
I'm sorry Canada.
I can't bring Joey Diaz,

1979
01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:29.920
but you can always sneak in and hang out with us.
We're,

1980
01:52:29.921 --> 01:52:32.510
we're at the ice house all the time.
We've had a bunch of committee,

1981
01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:36.430
Canadians and English people and people from all over the world come down and

1982
01:52:36.431 --> 01:52:37.360
hang out with the ice house,

1983
01:52:37.390 --> 01:52:41.770
which is really cool because the ice house is one of the oldest clubs in the

1984
01:52:41.771 --> 01:52:46.310
country.
It started in 1951.
I mean,
it's,
uh,

1985
01:52:46.490 --> 01:52:50.990
it was not working at 51 or 61.
Uh,
it's been 50 years,
so I don't know.

1986
01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:54.620
So that's not even,
I don't know,
whatever it is.
I think it's,

1987
01:52:54.621 --> 01:52:58.670
think it started off in the 50s and then the 60s,
it became a comedy club.

1988
01:52:58.910 --> 01:53:00.380
I think it was something else before that.

1989
01:53:00.381 --> 01:53:03.560
Like some sort of a jazz club or something stupid.
But,
um,
either way,

1990
01:53:03.561 --> 01:53:07.310
it's an amazing old club that's run by some really cool people.

1991
01:53:07.311 --> 01:53:10.970
They have the nicest wait staff and it's in Pasadena and we do shows there all

1992
01:53:10.971 --> 01:53:13.790
the time.
So we'd be there this Wednesday.
And do you ever share their Frye?

1993
01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:18.600
I haven't decided yet.
Oh see we're casual shit.

1994
01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:22.300
But what we usually do is like last week we had,
oh yes I do.

1995
01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:27.090
We had Greg Fitzsimmons,
dom,
I rera Ra should fear.
It's that kind of line up.

1996
01:53:27.091 --> 01:53:30.290
It's like all our friends that are in town,
we have them calmed down.

1997
01:53:30.291 --> 01:53:30.890
You do have one?

1998
01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:34.170
I do have one Friday at 10:00 PM is it in the main room with a small small room?

1999
01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:37.820
Small rooms.
Pretty dope too.
The small room was only like 85 seats.

2000
01:53:37.821 --> 01:53:40.520
It's like super intimate.
They have two rooms at the ice house,

2001
01:53:40.730 --> 01:53:42.920
but it's just like,
there's so much history in there.

2002
01:53:43.110 --> 01:53:47.510
Like the other day I went in there with Tommy Chong and uh,
we,
we were,

2003
01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:50.230
we were there I think two and Cheech and Chong with chomp.
Tommy t,
yeah,

2004
01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:53.660
we Cheech and Chong with Tommy Chong.
I really did.
When you get some,

2005
01:53:53.661 --> 01:53:57.730
you say you get high with Tommy Chong,
man,
that is cool as fuck.
Yeah.
And uh,

2006
01:53:57.740 --> 01:54:00.830
we went in there and it's like you get feel when you're standing in that room

2007
01:54:00.831 --> 01:54:03.500
and it's dark and there's no one on stage and there's no one in the room.

2008
01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:07.850
Like you could feel the energy that's been transmitted in that building.

2009
01:54:07.851 --> 01:54:08.350
Like that's,

2010
01:54:08.350 --> 01:54:13.130
that's a place where decades and decades of standup comedy has gone down.

2011
01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:14.360
So we're there a,

2012
01:54:14.370 --> 01:54:18.860
this one's a night and you can get tickets@icehousecomedy.com just click on the

2013
01:54:18.861 --> 01:54:21.710
link for death squad.
It probably isn't even up yet.

2014
01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:25.100
Just call them and tell me one in,
look at it.
They'll sell you a ticket.

2015
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:27.350
They'll figure that shit out.
Use your credit card.

2016
01:54:27.351 --> 01:54:29.690
You dirty bitches as in San Diego are amazing.

2017
01:54:29.691 --> 01:54:33.890
We had Jim Norton stopped in for one,
didn't even want to go up.
It's like,

2018
01:54:33.891 --> 01:54:36.450
well I don't want to go up.
I don't want to ruin these bay.
Tyler like,
wow,

2019
01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:40.430
he's so crazy and like go up.
These fucking people would love to see you.

2020
01:54:40.610 --> 01:54:44.760
Of course he went on stage.
They went crazy.
American Comedy Code Fort,

2021
01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:47.420
that Comedy Club,
if you live in San Diego,
it's amazing.

2022
01:54:47.421 --> 01:54:50.650
We're talking about medical and once a month now doing a death squad down there.

2023
01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:55.280
Yeah.
The club is the Shit,
the American Comedy Club Company.

2024
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:59.420
It's called the American cotton company and it's literally like the perfect

2025
01:54:59.421 --> 01:55:03.430
setup.
You walk in low ceilings,
it's sort of great.
What's,

2026
01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:07.750
what's the dude's name from San Jose that uh,
uh,
yeah,
that guy,

2027
01:55:07.751 --> 01:55:11.530
that Guy William h Macy there last night.
You did?
They give us,

2028
01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:14.450
it's talking right up front.
The front door and I came out.
Oh yeah.

2029
01:55:14.451 --> 01:55:18.620
He's there for that show.
Comicon for,
um,
what does it show?

2030
01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:22.030
Did you see that she's got a show about a loser family.
I can't remember.

2031
01:55:22.031 --> 01:55:24.230
It's hilarious.
Breaking bad was also there though.

2032
01:55:24.231 --> 01:55:27.530
And it's staying at the hotel next to the one I was staying at.

2033
01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:32.740
The Holt whole cast was there and then on the hotel we stayed at sons of anarchy

2034
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:35.780
was in that whole entire thing.
Yeah.
When we pulled up.

2035
01:55:35.781 --> 01:55:38.840
I had to like ask them if I could park because there was like a red carpet thing

2036
01:55:38.841 --> 01:55:42.440
going on.
I was like,
is the valet still open?
And they're like,
yeah.
I'm like,
okay,

2037
01:55:42.441 --> 01:55:47.180
I'm going to sneak by the red carpet.
My fucking car park it.
It's weird.

2038
01:55:47.181 --> 01:55:49.200
It's like both things were going on at the same time.

2039
01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:53.670
It was still actually a hotel and they still had this weird thing going on.

2040
01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:56.850
Met Beetle juice too.
Have you ever met that guy?
The guy that really,

2041
01:55:56.851 --> 01:56:00.240
really tiny head on Howard Stern.
Stern?
No,
I never met him.

2042
01:56:00.241 --> 01:56:03.030
How that was interesting.
I did meet him at the airport once.

2043
01:56:03.031 --> 01:56:06.870
I met him at the airport in Atlanta,
I think with Ari.
Oh wait,
no,

2044
01:56:06.871 --> 01:56:10.240
I wasn't there with you there.
Yeah,
I'd never said anything.

2045
01:56:10.241 --> 01:56:13.090
Then we just saw him just tell him to talk to him.
Yeah.
It's time to talk to him.

2046
01:56:13.091 --> 01:56:14.850
He got a picture with you.
I was like,
can I get a picture with you and goes,

2047
01:56:14.970 --> 01:56:17.100
you do what you gotta do?
And I'm like,
all right,
cool.

2048
01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:23.280
San Diego's a pretty fucking bad ass live there except for the the military

2049
01:56:23.281 --> 01:56:27.210
thing.
Military Weed and uh,
I don't know the hot blonde thing.

2050
01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:30.700
It's tons of blondes down there for summaries that bad.
What the fuck is no,
no,

2051
01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:34.020
no,
no,
no.
I mean I think,
but I didn't notice.

2052
01:56:34.021 --> 01:56:38.220
It's really weird that there's a lot of blond people I was looking around and

2053
01:56:38.221 --> 01:56:41.400
it's like every single person has blonde hair.
It's to counteract Mexico.

2054
01:56:41.401 --> 01:56:42.234
It's like

2055
01:56:43.710 --> 01:56:46.590
Terry there gravitate towards that area.

2056
01:56:46.591 --> 01:56:50.370
They don't even know why it's a gene pool bouncing out situation.
But yeah,

2057
01:56:50.371 --> 01:56:52.860
San Diego is a fucking awesome town,
man.
I love it there.

2058
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:56.790
It's one of my favorite places to go,
but it really is bizarre that they have,

2059
01:56:56.791 --> 01:57:01.380
like La Jolla has these 30 40 $50 million houses,

2060
01:57:01.410 --> 01:57:05.190
giant estates overlooking the water.
20 minutes from Tijuana,

2061
01:57:05.850 --> 01:57:09.160
20 minute drive to deal.
We had a bunch of tea.

2062
01:57:09.161 --> 01:57:10.650
You want of people came to the show,
you know,

2063
01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:12.900
I didn't know it was that easy to just drive over.

2064
01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:17.010
I made the drive with a few times.
But you,
if you live in Tiawana,

2065
01:57:17.190 --> 01:57:19.800
you could drive over to America and just see a show.
Absolutely.

2066
01:57:20.190 --> 01:57:24.530
What's really the line?
The line going across the border is fucking serious.

2067
01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:26.910
That would keep you from just staying,
I guess they don't.

2068
01:57:27.330 --> 01:57:31.200
If you're a legal citizen on the,
eventually we don't have to live,

2069
01:57:31.670 --> 01:57:33.650
but you don't have to have a visa or anything.
I come over here.

2070
01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:36.620
You just just hop over.
We,
we met a lot of people from team won.

2071
01:57:36.630 --> 01:57:39.440
It was like five or six people at the show.
They came from Tijuana.

2072
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:44.160
There were fans of the podcast.
It was weird.
I was like,
damn,
you look skinny.

2073
01:57:44.190 --> 01:57:48.810
Give here.
Don't miss back.
I like it down there.

2074
01:57:48.811 --> 01:57:51.930
I wish we could live down there.
It would be wrong.
Yeah.
No,
no.

2075
01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:56.900
San Diego bold choice.
I like that.
Like car and auto island.

2076
01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:59.030
Just go on that island.
There was just people playing,

2077
01:57:59.130 --> 01:58:02.430
playing softball at this park and you're just on this island.
It's just,

2078
01:58:02.530 --> 01:58:04.890
well that Allison,
beautiful islands,

2079
01:58:04.891 --> 01:58:08.130
one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in the country.
I could tell.

2080
01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:11.700
Yeah.
That island has some insane houses on it.
That a,

2081
01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:15.960
that's where Donald Rumsfeld lives.
Wow.
Yeah.
It's fucking,

2082
01:58:16.630 --> 01:58:19.800
you could smell fire and brimstone is to drive over the bridge.

2083
01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:25.410
A lot of rich industrialists and all sorts of fancy pants folks live on that

2084
01:58:25.411 --> 01:58:29.430
island.
Yeah,
I don't,
I dunno.
Uh,
that's a,
that's a real rich spot.

2085
01:58:29.790 --> 01:58:33.450
San Diego's got a lot of rich areas like La Hoya.
The Hoya is gorgeous.

2086
01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:38.820
That's where the comedy store is.
That's an amazing town.
Beautiful Man.

2087
01:58:39.090 --> 01:58:41.620
When we used to stay there,
I'd be like,
I would figuring out,

2088
01:58:41.621 --> 01:58:45.190
can I live here whenever we would do like comedy down there,
but can I live here?

2089
01:58:45.191 --> 01:58:49.240
It's only two hours away.
Why can I live here?
I could just send if you're lucky.

2090
01:58:49.241 --> 01:58:51.190
Two hours.
Yeah.
Four and a half for me.

2091
01:58:51.191 --> 01:58:54.300
It took me four and a half to get to the show.
No doubt.
No doubt.

2092
01:58:54.490 --> 01:58:58.120
What should we talk about a little on it stuff before we wrap this up here?
Yeah.

2093
01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:01.690
<v 2>So latest,
uh,
latest news in the audit world,
we got,
uh,</v>

2094
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:03.870
the new Alpha brain formula,
which is a,

2095
01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:06.970
just a slight tweak on the old Alpha brain formula.
Basically,

2096
01:59:07.210 --> 01:59:10.300
the acetylcholine mechanism remains exactly the same.

2097
01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:14.620
You have the WHO Persia Serrata as the Acetylcholine esterase inhibitor and you

2098
01:59:14.621 --> 01:59:19.330
have Alpha GPC is the raw source of Coleen to raise your acetylcholine levels.

2099
01:59:19.630 --> 01:59:22.890
And then,
uh,
for the dopamine mechanism we're using El tyrasine,

2100
01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:26.890
which is the basic source amino acid for El Dopa.
Uh,

2101
01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:28.540
instead of Mucuna periods,

2102
01:59:29.230 --> 01:59:32.950
I'm much more research behind El tyrasine and uh,

2103
01:59:32.970 --> 01:59:36.930
it's just seems to be a preferred ingredient for that.
And instead of the,
um,

2104
01:59:36.970 --> 01:59:39.870
supplemental Gaba,
we switched that out with [inaudible],

2105
01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:43.510
which is actually why when you drink green tea you don't get that kind of

2106
01:59:43.511 --> 01:59:47.560
hyperactive feeling that you do from coffee necessarily because green tea

2107
01:59:47.561 --> 01:59:49.230
contains natural healthy Janine,

2108
01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:52.840
which is related to the Gabba mechanism and kind of keeps you from getting too

2109
01:59:52.841 --> 01:59:57.790
hyper and a that's again going to temper that kind of vary a little bit manic

2110
01:59:57.791 --> 02:00:01.410
effect of the mental speed and that kind of focus that you get from these,

2111
02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:05.950
the a acetylcholine.
Um,
and then we added a phosphatidyl Serin,

2112
02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:07.300
which is a great ingredient.

2113
02:00:07.330 --> 02:00:11.350
Got a couple of cool studies with phosphatidyl serin.
One was,
which was,
um,

2114
02:00:11.710 --> 02:00:14.710
measuring the accuracy of people off of a golf tee,

2115
02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:19.450
driving towards a whole 135 yards away and found statistically significant

2116
02:00:19.451 --> 02:00:24.040
improvement in a double blind study for the people taking phosphatidyl serin as

2117
02:00:24.041 --> 02:00:26.500
far as hitting the ball straighter and what they,

2118
02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:29.860
what they found is that it just helps reduce mental fatigue.

2119
02:00:29.890 --> 02:00:32.530
It's a natural nutrient that's found in brain cell membranes.

2120
02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:36.460
I'm when to use it to rape down my rare and pool tonight.
Yes,
you should Max,

2121
02:00:36.461 --> 02:00:37.510
by the way,
Max separately,

2122
02:00:37.511 --> 02:00:40.990
one of the best pool player is a great instructor is just raving about Alpha

2123
02:00:40.991 --> 02:00:42.700
brain.
Yeah,
you sent me a tad.
Loves it as well.

2124
02:00:42.701 --> 02:00:46.750
He loves phosphatidyl Serin as well.
He's been using that for a long time,
so,
uh,

2125
02:00:46.751 --> 02:00:48.460
he's,
he's super pumped about it so,

2126
02:00:48.740 --> 02:00:49.401
<v 0>well it's,
it's,</v>

2127
02:00:49.401 --> 02:00:54.401
it's fascinating to me that this is a new frontier for a lot of folks.

2128
02:00:54.830 --> 02:00:58.220
You know,
a lot of people aren't really aware that there are a bunch of different

2129
02:00:58.221 --> 02:01:01.760
nutrients that have shown that they have a positive effect on your brain

2130
02:01:01.761 --> 02:01:02.594
function.

2131
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:06.260
<v 2>Absolutely,
absolutely.
And then,
uh,
I guess everything else remains the same.</v>

2132
02:01:06.261 --> 02:01:10.460
The AC 11 are proprietary antioxidant that comes from the rain forest Derbe

2133
02:01:10.461 --> 02:01:11.780
cat's claw,
um,

2134
02:01:11.781 --> 02:01:15.230
that they concentrate some of the alkaloids and really help you kind of clear

2135
02:01:15.231 --> 02:01:19.250
away some of your mental fog.
And then,
uh,
the BACOPA and the B six to help,
uh,

2136
02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:22.970
help round out the formula.
But I'm getting great feedback on the,

2137
02:01:22.971 --> 02:01:24.050
on the new form.
And again,

2138
02:01:24.051 --> 02:01:27.770
just a slight tweak for any of those who've been fans of the old alpha brain.

2139
02:01:27.771 --> 02:01:30.920
But,
uh,
definitely,
uh,
just a little bit better on all fronts.

2140
02:01:31.220 --> 02:01:34.340
And then we have the uh,
the Strawn bone and joint formula,

2141
02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:37.880
which we came out with,
which is new and that's focused around the,

2142
02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:42.940
the mineral strontium and a New England Journal of Medicine Study from 2004

2143
02:01:43.450 --> 02:01:48.450
showed that the people taking strontium ranelate I had a 41% decrease fracture

2144
02:01:48.951 --> 02:01:51.620
risk as far as developing the bone density.

2145
02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:54.590
And that's because strontium is one of the key minerals along with calcium

2146
02:01:55.010 --> 02:01:56.630
that's found in the bones.

2147
02:01:56.810 --> 02:02:01.250
And a lot of our processed foods have eliminated the natural strontium content.

2148
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:02.300
So it's,
you know,

2149
02:02:02.301 --> 02:02:06.260
one of the theories why so many people are experiencing osteoporosis is because

2150
02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:08.990
the natural strontium that generally comes from our foods,

2151
02:02:08.991 --> 02:02:10.070
we're not getting them anymore.

2152
02:02:10.150 --> 02:02:13.520
And then find him and mark or deficiencies or calcium is,
you know,
yeah,

2153
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:14.840
general mineral deficiencies.

2154
02:02:14.841 --> 02:02:16.940
And so we bought a bunch of other trace minerals in there.

2155
02:02:17.330 --> 02:02:20.720
Put some pretty traditional things for your joints,
MSM,
glucosamine,

2156
02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:22.010
hyaluronic acid,

2157
02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:25.730
and just make a kind of balance formula with the ingredient strontium,

2158
02:02:26.330 --> 02:02:30.500
which is best.
And a lot of these studies do have it in conjunction with calcium.

2159
02:02:30.501 --> 02:02:31.520
So we recommend taking,

2160
02:02:31.521 --> 02:02:34.160
but you're not supposed to take them at the same time cause I'll actually

2161
02:02:34.161 --> 02:02:36.650
compete for absorption because there's such a similar molecule.

2162
02:02:36.890 --> 02:02:40.730
So you take the strong bone or your strontium supplement in the morning per se,

2163
02:02:40.731 --> 02:02:44.640
and then take a calcium supplement at night.
So great formula for,
you know,

2164
02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:47.810
people who are in kind of active sports or if you're getting up there in age or

2165
02:02:47.811 --> 02:02:52.790
just want a better,
a better general bone and joint strength and flexibility.

2166
02:02:53.180 --> 02:02:57.350
And then,
uh,
some exciting new stuff coming out.
We got our hemp forest product,

2167
02:02:57.351 --> 02:03:01.070
which is fucking delicious,
like really good.
Just,
it's very simple.

2168
02:03:01.150 --> 02:03:04.720
<v 0>The best tasting protein powder I've ever had.
And it's the best for you.
Yeah.</v>

2169
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:08.800
The crazy thing is about how less I fart on that.
So yeah,
totally.

2170
02:03:08.860 --> 02:03:11.200
It's incredible.
I do it with coconut water.

2171
02:03:11.201 --> 02:03:14.230
Now see two o has this new version that uh,

2172
02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:19.500
Brian scared of you just taste like Paul goobers tastes like coconut loans will

2173
02:03:19.891 --> 02:03:23.710
be,
I know,
probably like a coconut.
I just shot it little in your mouth,

2174
02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:28.090
but it's um,
the coconut with pulp in it.
So he told us not a sponsor,

2175
02:03:28.091 --> 02:03:32.710
but there are friends.
So,
uh,
we,
uh,
them and alien ware,
we,
uh,

2176
02:03:32.711 --> 02:03:35.500
we talk about them just because they're cool and they hook us up.

2177
02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:40.240
Alienware her December,
some cool computers and [inaudible] keeps US hydrated.

2178
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:44.080
But I make,
I make shakes with,
um,
the,
uh,

2179
02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:48.130
hemp force and CTO and it's fucking delicious and no gas.

2180
02:03:48.490 --> 02:03:52.570
Not that I would make.
I would make these fucking muscle milkshakes,

2181
02:03:52.810 --> 02:03:54.220
which tastes so good,

2182
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:59.790
but would burn holes in the seat of my car while I was farting on the way they

2183
02:04:00.250 --> 02:04:03.730
judge is like Jesus a lot.
That's fun now and then,

2184
02:04:05.730 --> 02:04:10.420
<v 2>Oh,
it's got times.
Why don't you want to Fart?
Fighting's fine.</v>

2185
02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:13.860
There's a lot of issues with whey protein digestion.
I mean if you,

2186
02:04:13.861 --> 02:04:16.680
if you aren't careful,
it can create intestinal toxemia,

2187
02:04:16.681 --> 02:04:20.250
which is like a sludge that builds up in your intestines and actually prevents

2188
02:04:20.251 --> 02:04:23.340
the absorption of nutrients beyond that.
But it is a,

2189
02:04:23.341 --> 02:04:25.500
it is a very balanced kind of protein.

2190
02:04:25.501 --> 02:04:28.710
It's just really tough for the human body to kind of metabolize it.

2191
02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:31.170
Whereas hemp on the other hand,
hemp hearts,

2192
02:04:31.650 --> 02:04:34.880
two thirds of that is made up of a compound called [inaudible],

2193
02:04:35.070 --> 02:04:37.710
which is already very commonly found,
the human body.

2194
02:04:37.711 --> 02:04:41.250
So there's virtually no allergy or digestion issues.

2195
02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:46.290
Plus he got all the Omega Omega threes and sixes fatty acids in there.
The Gla,

2196
02:04:46.530 --> 02:04:50.820
um,
just a super protein for you.
And all we did was add some cocoa,

2197
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:53.850
which is again,
another one of the original superfoods,
you know,

2198
02:04:53.851 --> 02:04:56.310
got a bunch of good trace minerals,
chromium and,

2199
02:04:56.580 --> 02:05:00.270
and a variety of other things and uh,
and Maka as well.

2200
02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:02.540
Long traditional use of Maka,

2201
02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:06.360
being able to boost libido and also could chain a bunch of nutrients that

2202
02:05:06.361 --> 02:05:09.740
support the endocrine system and a little bit of Stevia.
And uh,

2203
02:05:10.150 --> 02:05:13.200
he's got a fucking delicious drink that'll refuel yourself.

2204
02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:17.750
<v 3>Good.
How launch were you?
Super Healthy.
Easy to digest,</v>

2205
02:05:17.751 --> 02:05:19.100
like everything about it.
I love,

2206
02:05:19.101 --> 02:05:22.970
it's my new favorite all time protein powder and no gas brother.

2207
02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:27.860
Let's that.
That Brian and the beauty of Stevie.
I love Stevie.
Yeah.

2208
02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:31.280
Stevie was interesting stuff.
If you could have too much of that stuff though.

2209
02:05:31.281 --> 02:05:35.060
If you try to put like a spoonful of and you're coughing,
it's almost on.

2210
02:05:35.290 --> 02:05:39.650
It's so strong.
The End Stevia though.
Two favorites.
Well,

2211
02:05:39.651 --> 02:05:42.830
Gavi is not necessarily good for you and your job,
it not really.
Yeah.

2212
02:05:42.831 --> 02:05:45.850
I always thought it was.
It sounds like herbal and shit like,
um,

2213
02:05:46.010 --> 02:05:47.380
have a little of Gavi and my,

2214
02:05:47.780 --> 02:05:52.560
it's basically like simple shirt that scores are up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.

2215
02:05:52.710 --> 02:05:57.470
That's fucked up.
It tastes good.
You know?
Look again,
moderation,

2216
02:05:57.620 --> 02:06:02.480
but Stevia,
way better for your body.
Way Better.
He just a little jazz of Stevia,

2217
02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:07.340
but the Stevia in a hemp force.
It's a,
it's a delicious combination.

2218
02:06:07.341 --> 02:06:10.250
The combination of the marker,
the cocoa,

2219
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:14.870
the raw cocoa and the hemp fiber all together.
Oh,
it's good.

2220
02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:17.870
It's good.
It's my favorite.
Yeah,
I fucked that shit up,
man.

2221
02:06:17.871 --> 02:06:20.270
You gave me a tub of that stuff.
I killed that in two days.

2222
02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:22.430
I was fucking drink it at all the time.

2223
02:06:22.431 --> 02:06:24.470
I had two in a row because they were so good.

2224
02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:28.100
But muscle milk's pretty God damn good too.

2225
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:31.970
But for me the fart drop off is it's really worth it.

2226
02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:36.710
But I feel like I can work out quicker to like go would I like whey protein.

2227
02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:37.573
But um,

2228
02:06:37.610 --> 02:06:41.690
a lot of times when I would take it I would feel like a little slow for like an

2229
02:06:41.690 --> 02:06:44.360
hour and a half cause he's got all that blood in that trying to deal with that

2230
02:06:44.361 --> 02:06:46.600
shit.
Yeah,
it was just an absorb easily.
It's not as,

2231
02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:50.310
not nearly as easily absorb as plant braced a protein,

2232
02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:52.500
hemp protein if you're looking for another time,

2233
02:06:52.660 --> 02:06:53.493
<v 2>protein to the,</v>

2234
02:06:53.500 --> 02:06:57.250
probably the second best I think is a combination of rice and pea protein

2235
02:06:57.610 --> 02:07:00.130
together.
They're very complimentary protein.
Those are pretty good.

2236
02:07:00.131 --> 02:07:03.580
They don't have the extra nutrients that hamp does or the pedestrian that's part

2237
02:07:03.581 --> 02:07:06.850
of the human body.
But that's a pretty good one.
Soy has a lot of issues too.

2238
02:07:07.100 --> 02:07:08.990
<v 3>Plus you don't get stone or credit,</v>

2239
02:07:09.810 --> 02:07:12.950
get straight stolen or credit from eating ham protein.

2240
02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:16.180
We show bitches your muscles.
The shit came from him,

2241
02:07:17.210 --> 02:07:20.360
came from the hamp and they had to bring it in from Canada because we're too

2242
02:07:20.361 --> 02:07:25.361
stupid to grow messes like this Keenan here in America to legal.

2243
02:07:26.370 --> 02:07:27.550
How stupid in way.

2244
02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:31.850
That's one of the really the most hurtful things about this retarded government.

2245
02:07:32.970 --> 02:07:36.400
No Ham.
And by the way,
Henry Ford made the first car at a hamp.

2246
02:07:36.650 --> 02:07:39.580
You know we talked about this in the podcast is a video you can get online.

2247
02:07:39.581 --> 02:07:42.610
It's pretty dope.
Have you ever seen it,
Brian?
Yeah,

2248
02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:46.270
he hits it with a hammer so it a few times it hits the fucking fenders with a

2249
02:07:46.271 --> 02:07:50.740
hammer and the the,
this fiberglass that he's made out of hemp is so strong.

2250
02:07:50.741 --> 02:07:55.090
The hammer's just bouncing off of it.
Frank,
I wanted to get a corvette.

2251
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:58.270
Let me just throw this out there.
See if anybody knows how this can be done.

2252
02:07:59.170 --> 02:08:03.250
I wanted to get a corvette and then get the body panels made out of hemp.

2253
02:08:03.490 --> 02:08:06.220
How hard would that be to do?
Would that be really hard to do?

2254
02:08:06.490 --> 02:08:10.130
Somebody telling me if it's dingy,
ask that last week.
Yeah I did,
but no one,

2255
02:08:10.131 --> 02:08:13.420
no one responded.
They probably got too high.

2256
02:08:14.290 --> 02:08:15.450
Anybody who knows how to Doug,

2257
02:08:17.710 --> 02:08:20.390
I have the resources that you seek.
So

2258
02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:25.550
if they really did know how to do it,
they forgot to get back.

2259
02:08:25.830 --> 02:08:28.720
But I just want to know is there,
someone responded me on Twitter if you know,

2260
02:08:28.930 --> 02:08:30.970
is there a way to do that?
Because if there is a way to do that,

2261
02:08:30.971 --> 02:08:33.940
that would be bad ass.
I like that.
Must think better than I liked that corvette.

2262
02:08:34.030 --> 02:08:37.020
Yeah.
I don't think you should get a red car.
Shut up son.
I'm,

2263
02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:38.770
I'm in love with this new Mustang.

2264
02:08:38.771 --> 02:08:43.060
This is a new Mustang Shelby that's coming out.
It's got,
I think it's,
it's,

2265
02:08:43.090 --> 02:08:45.520
I think I said it wrong,
I think.
Oh yeah.

2266
02:08:46.030 --> 02:08:49.270
It's 650 horsepower.
Not 640.

2267
02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:54.220
It's six 5,650 horsepower in a Mustang.

2268
02:08:54.970 --> 02:08:57.910
I mean it's hilarious.
Three miles per gallon.
No,

2269
02:08:57.940 --> 02:09:01.240
it actually doesn't even have a gas guzzler tax because it's,
um,

2270
02:09:01.270 --> 02:09:05.620
it's not naturally aspirated as a supercharger on it.
So it's a big Ass v eight,

2271
02:09:05.621 --> 02:09:07.690
but it's really efficient.
And then on top of that,

2272
02:09:07.691 --> 02:09:11.670
it's connected to a radical fucking supercharger that is,

2273
02:09:12.420 --> 02:09:17.230
gives you this mad wine over the roar of the Va.
But I'm in love with this car,

2274
02:09:17.231 --> 02:09:22.120
man.
This might be my next shit I guess.
Well,
I wanted to,
I look,
I like,

2275
02:09:22.210 --> 02:09:25.690
I have a Mustang.
I have a Shelby gt 500 convertible.
I like,

2276
02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:28.750
but I'm not really that far.
I'm not really that cool.

2277
02:09:28.751 --> 02:09:31.810
Would convertibles just too many variables.

2278
02:09:31.870 --> 02:09:34.390
I've seen too many cars flip over on the highway and shit.
I'm like,

2279
02:09:34.391 --> 02:09:38.290
that doesn't seem like a smart thing because you can have a metal roof.
You know,

2280
02:09:38.291 --> 02:09:41.750
you probably should have a metal roof.
But um,
but I,

2281
02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:45.130
I love the idea of getting an American car that's a fun car.

2282
02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:48.760
And if there's anything that America does right,
it's making muscle cars.

2283
02:09:48.761 --> 02:09:52.870
It's so last shit we do right when it comes to manufacturing.

2284
02:09:53.110 --> 02:09:56.410
And I just love the fact that these guys were really going for it,

2285
02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:01.180
that they really have made a 650 fucking horsepower Mustang.
I mean,

2286
02:10:01.210 --> 02:10:05.270
I almost feel like I'm obligated to buy something like this because they're,

2287
02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:08.480
they're so silly that they made it.
That's how I felt like about a,

2288
02:10:08.481 --> 02:10:10.820
the corvette zr one.
I felt the same way about that.
Dude.

2289
02:10:11.020 --> 02:10:13.720
It's so silly that they made such a crazy car.

2290
02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:18.970
I feel like obligated because if I was a kid and I was like,
man,
if I,
you know,

2291
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:21.490
if I saw something like that about it,
man,
if I had enough money,

2292
02:10:21.491 --> 02:10:23.500
I'd buy one of those,
you know?
Yeah.
That's what you should do.

2293
02:10:23.501 --> 02:10:25.840
You should buy one of those if you have enough money.
I got one.

2294
02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:30.050
I got the challenge.
I love it.
Yeah.
Challenges a dope car.
It's again,

2295
02:10:30.051 --> 02:10:32.440
it's American muscle car.
They figured out how to make it right.

2296
02:10:32.590 --> 02:10:35.530
They're fun to draw.
They sound good.
I'm not alone.

2297
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:40.140
These sound like they're alive.
They have some fucking passion to them.
Right,

2298
02:10:40.150 --> 02:10:43.520
Brian [inaudible] that's the last thing we do well when we do a lot of shit.

2299
02:10:43.521 --> 02:10:47.330
Well,
we have the best music.
We have the best comedy socket.
If you disagree,

2300
02:10:47.450 --> 02:10:51.890
suck it.
Suck it.
Yeah.
England has some good music in England,
has some good

2301
02:10:51.930 --> 02:10:55.030
<v 0>comedy,
but that's about it.
The rest of the world can suck my dad,</v>

2302
02:10:57.690 --> 02:11:00.470
you know,
I mean Japanese make a few pretty bad ass cars.

2303
02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:03.960
Your comedy is ridiculous.
Stop.
I know he invented martial arts,

2304
02:11:04.190 --> 02:11:08.730
but comedy's got to go out the window.
Anything to say Brian,

2305
02:11:08.731 --> 02:11:12.420
before we wrap this up?
Brian did something yesterday.

2306
02:11:13.610 --> 02:11:18.610
Not good for his head and right now I think when I smoked weed it just kicked it

2307
02:11:19.201 --> 02:11:22.890
back in probably.
Yeah.
I'm pretty pretty good right now.

2308
02:11:24.190 --> 02:11:25.800
What's Kamari settle the fuck around?

2309
02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:33.120
Is that the,
is that how you get girls?
Talk to him.
Wake up.
Come here girl.

2310
02:11:33.180 --> 02:11:37.190
Come here.
Come here.
I felt it felt vulnerable.
Um,

2311
02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:41.280
anything more?
No,
that's it.
I've been a super active on my blog,

2312
02:11:41.281 --> 02:11:45.560
so if anybody wants to keep up with me,

Just had a podcast with Mitch Schultes,
a Dmt,
the spirit molecule.

2314

It's fucking really cool conversation.
I keep them to about an hour,
but I,

2315
02:11:52.781 --> 02:11:55.590
that was really cool.
So check it out.
You can see the links from a warrior poet.

2324
02:12:26.191 --> 02:12:27.170
since I was a little kid.

2325
02:12:27.171 --> 02:12:32.090
I can't tell you many documentaries I've watched and books I've read have been

2326
02:12:32.091 --> 02:12:35.630
fascinating.
This guy has seen a Sasquatch,
allegedly.
Did you say,

2327
02:12:35.690 --> 02:12:38.990
did you see the South Park about big foot?
Yeah,
no,

2328
02:12:41.060 --> 02:12:44.810
I should really watch south park about everything.
Uh,
so that's uh,

2329
02:12:44.811 --> 02:12:47.780
that's Tuesday.
Wednesday we have Justin Helpern on the podcast.

2331
02:12:49.311 --> 02:12:54.080
My Dad says he wrote the movie and he's got a book called,
I suck at girls.

Go get 'em,
go get yourself on a fucking workout program.

2352
02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:03.030
We have all sorts of different,

2353
02:14:04.410 --> 02:14:07.440
you can buy them in packages,

2354
02:14:07.620 --> 02:14:11.550
all sorts of different packages for beginners and for people who are a bit more

2355
02:14:11.551 --> 02:14:12.330
experienced.

2356
02:14:12.330 --> 02:14:16.140
There's a hundred different fucking more videos on youtube of different

2357
02:14:16.141 --> 02:14:19.950
kettlebell techniques and there's a lot of DVDs and stuff that's available as

2358
02:14:19.951 --> 02:14:22.470
well.
We're eventually going to make our own DVD.
We're going to get on that.

2359
02:14:22.471 --> 02:14:25.170
We'll probably talk about that as soon as we shut off this fucking podcast.
Okay,

2360
02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:29.340
so we've got to get to it.
All right.
We love you guys.
We will see you tomorrow.

2361
02:14:29.341 --> 02:14:32.910
Thank you everybody for all the positive energy and all the positive tweets and

2362
02:14:33.210 --> 02:14:36.750
all the cool mother fuckers that come out to these comedy shows and it's

2363
02:14:36.751 --> 02:14:38.670
overwhelming you for sure.

2364
02:14:38.671 --> 02:14:43.330
We have tapped into some sort of a vein of the coolest people on Earth.
And I,

2365
02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:43.891
you know,

2366
02:14:43.891 --> 02:14:48.050
we hear from all you people that we are contributing to your happiness and we

2367
02:14:48.051 --> 02:14:51.720
are contributing to your positive energy and make no mistake about it.

2368
02:14:51.721 --> 02:14:55.000
We feel very obligated,
very connected,
and,
and,
and we,

2369
02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:58.050
we were all a part of this thing.
We're all part of this thing together.

2370
02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:01.890
We're just the antenna and whatever the radio,

2371
02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:04.770
the thing that keeps it moving.
I ran out of cliches.

2372
02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:06.600
I'll see you fucking freaks tomorrow.

2373
02:15:06.990 --> 02:15:09.780
Keep it in your pants unless you're going to use it.

2374
02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:18.720
