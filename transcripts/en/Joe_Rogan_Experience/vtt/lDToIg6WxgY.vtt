1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.990
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't even think that was going</v>

2
00:00:02.991 --> 00:00:05.180
<v Speaker 1>to be a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that's comics.</v>

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that I'm used to sitting around</v>
<v Speaker 1>with those guys at the cellar,</v>

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.060
<v Speaker 1>it's how we communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't tell you where half of</v>

6
00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:18.230
<v Speaker 1>these guys who were my best friends grew</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

7
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.140
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready with so many insults for them.</v>

8
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.260
<v Speaker 1>If one of the mocks back wearing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid jacket,</v>

9
00:00:24.261 --> 00:00:27.260
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't wait.</v>

10
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.130
<v Speaker 1>Norton is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

11
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norton has crushed me so many times.</v>

12
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Talked about this funny story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a slice of pizza and Louis Ck som</v>

13
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Speaker 1>on the street and just slapped a slice</v>
<v Speaker 1>of pizza to the ground</v>

14
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.920
<v Speaker 2>just for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he starts to laugh and when he's</v>

15
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:50.390
<v Speaker 2>telling the story and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

16
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:52.640
<v Speaker 2>I was a juicy pizza pizza too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a nice one.</v>

17
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.670
<v Speaker 2>You can do that to another person that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't appreciate it.</v>

18
00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.840
<v Speaker 2>The humor in the</v>

19
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>appropriateness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So happy.</v>

20
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.160
<v Speaker 1>The other night we were just playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keith Robinson.</v>

21
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.820
<v Speaker 1>When he got eliminated from star search,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were playing it over and over again</v>

22
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 1>in front of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

23
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think that you can come to Amy</v>

24
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Schumer and slap her fucking pizza down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what we're saying.</v>

25
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get a friend,</v>

26
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.320
<v Speaker 1>a good friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's so fun.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like you can get it,</v>

29
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:30.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's still happy that he's doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>well again.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And</v>

109
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 3>the other day I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Venice beach getting launched</v>

110
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 3>and I got a beer and a burger and</v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoyed something that's known in the</v>

111
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 3>state of California to have medicinal</v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit.</v>

112
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.130
<v Speaker 3>And I looked up in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

113
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 3>whenever this place was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this restaurant.</v>

114
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 3>And right over the door was the picture</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Obama from his Hawaii days.</v>

115
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:55.570
<v Speaker 3>He had the hat on and he was smoking a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doobie.</v>

116
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.210
<v Speaker 3>And for like a half a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

117
00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 3>that's my guy right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 2008 campaign trail,</v>

118
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:02.830
<v Speaker 3>Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then of course,</v>

119
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 3>that's not what we got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got smart Bush.</v>

120
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:08.890
<v Speaker 3>Instead we got somebody who can like</v>
<v Speaker 3>come onto to the tonight show or the</v>

121
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 3>view or something and just have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>host's eating out of his hand by the end</v>

122
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 3>of the interview.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's much smarter and more eloquent,</v>

123
00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 3>but it's still doing a lot of the crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit that Bush was doing.</v>

124
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.050
<v Speaker 3>And I think that he could still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

125
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 3>kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the word I'm looking for?</v>

126
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:24.574
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

127
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come out ahead and like still come</v>

128
00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 3>across as a good president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you were to legalize weed at the</v>

129
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 3>federal level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think most people be like,</v>

130
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.801
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

131
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 3>He actually did something meaningful</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will be around 50 years from now.</v>

132
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 3>And it's not just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tax,</v>

133
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to find the shit out of you if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't sign up for my healthcare</v>

134
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.710
<v Speaker 3>website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

135
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done more drone strikes than any</v>

136
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:47.880
<v Speaker 3>other president in history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've allowed NSA programs to expand and</v>

137
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 3>said almost nothing in response if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were even with all that shit,</v>

138
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 3>which I think is awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Legalize weed at the federal level and I</v>

139
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 3>would rate him as a good president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Xi Are Hilarious,</v>

140
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>first of all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's a joint.</v>

141
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I think that picture is a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at it many times.</v>

142
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 1>I've studied it like this approved or</v>
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>

143
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at it quite closely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever noticed this when you're</v>

144
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:10.880
<v Speaker 1>high?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everything seems to be a reminder</v>

145
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>that your high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

146
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:14.820
<v Speaker 1>no because I've been getting high longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you son.</v>

147
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 1>But the guys holding it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never hold a cigarette like that.</v>

148
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>He's really enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

149
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Let me slows that closing on that bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get a CSI on this map.</v>

150
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Look how many closer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how it's not like,</v>

151
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.350
<v Speaker 1>like it looks squished and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a role joint.</v>

152
00:06:31.351 --> 00:06:33.570
<v Speaker 1>We'll get this smoke signature and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what?</v>

153
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another,</v>

154
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.950
<v Speaker 1>here's another uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

155
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how far down he's already smoking</v>

156
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:42.230
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would basically be in the filter.</v>

157
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 1>If it was a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

158
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 1>100% rolled his own cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a cowboy.</v>

159
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know dudes who do that rolled</v>

160
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>menthols.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

161
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.100
<v Speaker 1>how dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the commander in chief.</v>

162
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.440
<v Speaker 1>You're a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

163
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 1>he's the commander in chief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You son of a bitch.</v>
