<v Speaker 1>York City.</v>

21
00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't get to New York City very often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only go there like once every year and</v>

22
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.680
<v Speaker 1>a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

28
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.260
<v Speaker 1>get any on my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will definitely.</v>

30
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian was supposed to beat my lips.</v>

31
00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:06.271
<v Speaker 1>Are very shy today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian was supposed to be here today for </v>

32
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:07.120
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he got held in traffic and getting,</v>

33
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.750
<v Speaker 1>getting boned by the irs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back taxes.</v>

34
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Pay Your taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitches.</v>

35
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.920
<v Speaker 1>That's uncle Joe's advice for the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay Your fucking taxes.</v>

36
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.520
<v Speaker 1>The worst thing is when the irs like </v>
<v Speaker 1>signals you out,</v>

37
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.940
<v Speaker 1>singles you out as a guy who's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying taxes,</v>

38
00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:27.430
<v Speaker 1>and then they just crawl up your ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole and look around.</v>

39
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.060
<v Speaker 1>The tax laws are so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is so gross.</v>

40
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.270
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you have to pay such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant percentage of what you make to do </v>

41
00:02:36.341 --> 00:02:39.370
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To keep more people arresting people for</v>

42
00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:41.830
<v Speaker 1>buying pot to do what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To fix the streets.</v>

43
00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Is that where the fuck is the money </v>
<v Speaker 1>going?</v>

44
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.110
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our machine is just too God damn big.</v>

45
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 1>You know when you get to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money,</v>

46
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:54.121
<v Speaker 1>you get into a 48 percent tax bracket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you have to pay half of what </v>

47
00:02:54.431 --> 00:02:57.070
<v Speaker 1>you make half literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

48
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>And the crazy thing is the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>make them more money,</v>

49
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>the more money you make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather the higher percentage you have to</v>

50
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:09.571
<v Speaker 1>pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not only do you pay more money just </v>

51
00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:09.571
<v Speaker 1>because you make more money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems,</v>

52
00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:13.740
<v Speaker 1>that seems rational to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that you pay a higher </v>

53
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just like saying,</v>

54
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know you got it.</v>

55
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give us the money.</v>

56
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense that someone </v>

57
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.711
<v Speaker 1>who makes more money somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses a higher percentage of resources.</v>

58
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>That's completely unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense,</v>

59
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:34.051
<v Speaker 1>but people just accept it but just </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept it and they just take it in the </v>

60
00:03:34.051 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>ass and the machine keeps rolling on </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

61
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:42.511
<v Speaker 1>Will be no end or will there will go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a first the twitter to check it out of </v>

70
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.900
<v Speaker 1>fortune.</v>

71
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

72
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's A.</v>

73
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a simple way of looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

74
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>CMC dermo 73.</v>

75
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a simple way of looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody says pull out,</v>

76
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>but why the fuck are we there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first place?</v>

77
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Like what is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

78
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Is it as simple as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:38.131
<v Speaker 1>we're over there because we need to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>these terrorists from becoming strong.</v>

80
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.660
<v Speaker 1>We need to go and attack them at their </v>
<v Speaker 1>base.</v>

81
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

82
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 1>if that was what was agreed that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why we're there,</v>

83
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of people that say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

84
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.520
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that say there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few Taliban that are actually left </v>

85
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.251
<v Speaker 1>in Afghanistan that we have other </v>
<v Speaker 1>motives and that these motives might be </v>

86
00:04:56.251 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 1>the natural gas pipeline that runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>through Afghanistan,</v>

87
00:04:57.041 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 1>which are bloody apparently has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to control for years or they also</v>

88
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 1>very overlooked in a subject that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

89
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.240
<v Speaker 1>They kind of poo poo it and they make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem like it's not that big a deal is </v>

90
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.331
<v Speaker 1>the opium market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan produces some 90 something </v>

91
00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 1>percent of the entire world's opium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The entire world's poppy seeds.</v>

92
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>The entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heroin,</v>

93
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>more than 90 percent of it is produced </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Afghanistan.</v>

94
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

95
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.380
<v Speaker 1>You hear about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like there's a lot of goddamn money </v>

<v Speaker 1>literally almost all of it in this one </v>

<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

104
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.290

106
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.100

<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is absolute fact,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like our government dollars.</v>

111

<v Speaker 2>and he's an employee of the CIA.</v>

114

<v Speaker 2>Is it that blatant?</v>

115
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.730
<v Speaker 2>Is that obvious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's for sure there's a ton of </v>

116
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 2>fucking corruption when it comes to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher levels of government,</v>

117
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 2>but I think really selling drugs or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really doing it that openly.</v>

118
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 2>It seems ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

119
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there's no way that could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be possible.</v>

120
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 2>There's no way it could be that corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was,</v>

121
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:49.091
<v Speaker 2>we would have heard about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you start researching the </v>

122
00:06:49.091 --> 00:06:52.391
<v Speaker 2>history of the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they've been accused of doing this </v>

123
00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 2>for ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just accused of doing this,</v>

124
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:56.650
<v Speaker 2>but people who don't make any sense like</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy people and you know,</v>

125
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Internet conspiracy theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

126
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 2>they've been accused of doing it by </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who used to work for the CIA.</v>

127
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.600
<v Speaker 2>They've been accused of doing it by </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have actually flown in the </v>

128
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.151
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a great case about a guy named </v>

129
00:07:10.151 --> 00:07:12.551
<v Speaker 2>barry seal's from MENA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arkansas escapes to driving flying to </v>

130
00:07:12.551 --> 00:07:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Mena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arkansas and dropoff big packages of </v>

131
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.581
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've talked about this before </v>

132
00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:18.581
<v Speaker 2>or I've talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And anyway,</v>

133
00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:18.800
<v Speaker 2>these two kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

134
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:21.740
<v Speaker 2>inadvertently were there when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine got dropped.</v>

135
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they witnessed what had happened.</v>

136
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.370
<v Speaker 2>So they took these kids and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>murdered them and they left their bodies</v>

137
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 2>on the train tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the excuse,</v>

138
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:35.591
<v Speaker 2>the official excuse at the police used </v>
<v Speaker 2>was that these kids had gotten high and </v>

139
00:07:35.591 --> 00:07:36.770
<v Speaker 2>that they had fallen asleep on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plane.</v>

140
00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Sharks because they were on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

141
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.520
<v Speaker 2>the mothers of the kids forced </v>
<v Speaker 2>autopsies,</v>

142
00:07:42.521 --> 00:07:45.620
<v Speaker 2>the parents forced ops autopsies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't want to do autopsies,</v>

143
00:07:45.621 --> 00:07:46.740
<v Speaker 2>but they forced them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

144
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.770
<v Speaker 2>they got them done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it turns out that these kids had </v>

145
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:51.770
<v Speaker 2>been murdered.</v>

146
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.700
<v Speaker 2>They had been stabbed multiple times </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they had been put on these train </v>

147
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.511
<v Speaker 2>tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then the investigation goes further </v>

148
00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 2>and it turns out this guy named Barry </v>
<v Speaker 2>Seal's who is a CIA employee and there's</v>

149
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.780
<v Speaker 2>no documented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy's got a great long history with</v>

150
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:08.030
<v Speaker 2>the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's tons of pictures,</v>

151
00:08:08.031 --> 00:08:10.490
<v Speaker 2>there's tons of documentation on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

152
00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:14.840
<v Speaker 2>And this guy was flying in drugs from </v>
<v Speaker 2>South America and that's what he did.</v>

153
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 2>He did it for the CIA and right when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was about to go testify,</v>

154
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:20.600
<v Speaker 2>the guy gets murdered that gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>assassinated,</v>

155
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:25.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with George Bush's phone number in his </v>

156
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:25.700
<v Speaker 2>pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

157
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 2>so there's that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

158
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:29.400
<v Speaker 2>there's another guy named Michael Rupert</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Michael.</v>

159
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.440
<v Speaker 2>Rupert has a website now and he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of books on the whole situation,</v>

160
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:39.200
<v Speaker 2>but his story is that he was working for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lapd.</v>

161
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if he worked in narcotics,</v>

162
00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:47.261
<v Speaker 2>but he's involved somehow or another and</v>
<v Speaker 2>some narcotics case and it turns out </v>

163
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:51.420
<v Speaker 2>that the CIA was involved and the CIA </v>
<v Speaker 2>was protecting these people in the CIA.</v>

164
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.960
<v Speaker 2>He was selling drugs and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

165
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:59.530
<v Speaker 2>went to try to report it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They squashed everything and he just </v>

166
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:00.510
<v Speaker 2>went public with everything and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

167
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 2>he gets very little attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

168
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 2>it's really shocking how little </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to yet.</v>

169
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

170
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 2>he's a fascinating dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This Michael Rupert Guy,</v>

171
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 2>he's got a couple of really fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 2>books.</v>

172
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

173
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of the Rubicon is one and that's</v>

174
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:18.460
<v Speaker 2>the one I've read and there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got it,</v>

175
00:09:18.461 --> 00:09:23.461
<v Speaker 2>he's got a few other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically like going into great </v>

176
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 2>depth and detail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of his research on the CIA and their</v>

177
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 2>involvement in drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

178
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 2>why would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would our government do that?</v>

179
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of goddamn money on it.</v>

180
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.740
<v Speaker 2>I think they could justify that either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much money involved in drugs and </v>

181
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:37.950
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to make that money.</v>

182
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.770
<v Speaker 2>People are addicted to drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why don't we make that money in the</v>

183
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 2>least that money's being made by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>good guys.</v>

184
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:44.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like the most idealistic point of</v>

185
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:46.680
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make sure your kids don't do drugs.</v>

186
00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.930
<v Speaker 2>Make sure no one that he loves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude does drugs,</v>

187
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:53.931
<v Speaker 2>but let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people out there that are </v>

188
00:09:53.931 --> 00:09:53.931
<v Speaker 2>going to do drugs and if anybody should </v>
<v Speaker 2>make the money,</v>

189
00:09:53.931 --> 00:09:56.010
<v Speaker 2>it should be the good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see people falling for that,</v>

190
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.940
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom line is it's all greed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all this nasty,</v>

191
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.910
<v Speaker 2>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greed,</v>

192
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.930
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole reason why some drugs </v>

193
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.221
<v Speaker 2>are legal and some drugs are illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because when they make them </v>

194
00:10:10.221 --> 00:10:10.770
<v Speaker 2>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can control what you do.</v>

195
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 2>They can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't control things that are really</v>

196
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:16.110
<v Speaker 2>easy to grow like marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the main reasons why marijuana</v>

197
00:10:16.111 --> 00:10:18.810
<v Speaker 2>is illegal is because it's so god damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>easy to grow.</v>

198
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.820
<v Speaker 2>He could just plant seeds out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>

199
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:22.040
<v Speaker 2>It'll grow on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

200
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.700
<v Speaker 2>you don't even need to help it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

201
00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:28.701
<v Speaker 2>it's a really hardy plant and I know a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of morons that grow pot and when you</v>

202
00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:32.310
<v Speaker 2>know it's an easy thing to do like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't control that,</v>

203
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:32.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

204
00:10:32.871 --> 00:10:34.140
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to be able to control </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

205
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:35.850
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be people selling it </v>
<v Speaker 2>left and right.</v>

206
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to get taxes from that</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people would just get to </v>

207
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.000
<v Speaker 2>exchange cash or whatever the fuck they </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do with it.</v>

208
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.780
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be able to wrap </v>
<v Speaker 2>something up the way they get wrap up </v>

209
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.590
<v Speaker 2>oxycontin's or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

210
00:10:46.591 --> 00:10:48.630
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to produce an </v>
<v Speaker 2>Oxycontin,</v>

211
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:49.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they liked that.</v>

212
00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:51.540
<v Speaker 2>They don't like heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heroin is just like,</v>

213
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:51.950
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

214
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.960
<v Speaker 2>You're growing a plant and then you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>scraping some shit off the plan and </v>

215
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.150
<v Speaker 2>you're selling never stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's illegal.</v>

216
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.770
<v Speaker 2>We will let you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we will let you buy these pills that</v>

217
00:11:01.771 --> 00:11:06.771
<v Speaker 2>are basically the same goddamn thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just made by a pharmaceutical </v>

218
00:11:06.771 --> 00:11:09.741
<v Speaker 2>company and they process it and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>make this orally adjustable heroin and </v>

219
00:11:09.741 --> 00:11:10.440
<v Speaker 2>that's what Oxycontin is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

220
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:12.360
<v Speaker 2>it literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it hillbilly heroin.</v>

221
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.700
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is heroin.</v>

222
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.420
<v Speaker 2>You're just eating it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

223
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:21.300
<v Speaker 2>you're eating it in a pill form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like Marinol is thc in a pill form,</v>

224
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:26.630
<v Speaker 2>but that stuff's supposed to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to people that say that </v>

225
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.480
<v Speaker 2>principle thc is link one active element</v>
<v Speaker 2>and marijuana,</v>

226
00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:30.960
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole bunch of two way better </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get the actual stuff from the plant.</v>

227
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's true with heroin.</v>

228
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.640
<v Speaker 2>I've never done heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never done marinol either.</v>

229
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.610
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared of anything that's addictive.</v>

230
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.690
<v Speaker 2>But if I was a musician I might consider</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

231
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:47.900
<v Speaker 2>I might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might just start a little every now </v>

232
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:47.900
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

233
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.410
<v Speaker 2>write down and wants today and never </v>
<v Speaker 2>again or something.</v>

234
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Try to convince myself that somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another it wouldn't be addicted.</v>

235
00:11:51.991 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it really is</v>

236
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.110
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear varying reports.</v>

237
00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:01.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem I have with toe whenever </v>

238
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 1>someone talks about things being </v>
<v Speaker 1>addictive and not being addicted is that</v>

239
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.540
<v Speaker 1>alcohol is addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

240
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:09.541
<v Speaker 1>people get addicted to alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not addicted to it so I don't </v>

241
00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:09.541
<v Speaker 1>get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

242
00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:10.320
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

243
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:15.330
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone told me right now I could </v>

244
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:15.370
<v Speaker 1>never have another beer or another glass</v>
<v Speaker 1>of wine for the rest of my life,</v>

245
00:12:15.371 --> 00:12:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

246
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like a habit,</v>

247
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:24.511
<v Speaker 1>a shot every now and then with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends just to get fucking crazy or </v>

248
00:12:24.511 --> 00:12:26.881
<v Speaker 1>shot before shows from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But realistically it's not that </v>

249
00:12:26.881 --> 00:12:26.881
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

250
00:12:26.881 --> 00:12:28.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really addictive to me,</v>

251
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.300
<v Speaker 1>but to some people it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

252
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Is that the case with heroin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the case with cigarettes seem to</v>

253
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:40.021
<v Speaker 1>be the one they've got the most wired </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes seem to be the one they can </v>

254
00:12:40.021 --> 00:12:41.280
<v Speaker 1>addict the most people to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.130
<v Speaker 1>because there's a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get addicted to the normal stuff.</v>

256
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of people that drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee and they drink it all the time,</v>

257
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:50.740
<v Speaker 1>but they can just quit and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>bother them at all.</v>

258
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.700
<v Speaker 1>And there's some people that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't have coffee everyday,</v>

259
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.990
<v Speaker 1>they're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people are addicted to caffeine.</v>

260
00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.440
<v Speaker 1>When I was writing my blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was writing a monthly blog right </v>

261
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.160
<v Speaker 1>before I recorded my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

262
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.690
<v Speaker 1>my comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

263
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.500
<v Speaker 1>my m spike TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy special.</v>

264
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to make sure I kept my brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>like real sharp.</v>

265
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.710
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

266
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 1>the best way to do that is to perform as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much as I can,</v>

267
00:13:10.721 --> 00:13:15.721
<v Speaker 1>but also write as much as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I forced myself into writing a blog </v>

268
00:13:15.721 --> 00:13:17.880
<v Speaker 1>every day for a whole month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

269
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.570
<v Speaker 1>when I did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:24.571
<v Speaker 1>I was drinking a lot of coffee and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking French press coffee where it's </v>

271
00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:25.870
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really fucking strong,</v>

272
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I make it strong too.</v>

273
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.040
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like a strong cup of coffee,</v>

274
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.350
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is I was drinking this </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit like two,</v>

275
00:13:32.351 --> 00:13:37.351
<v Speaker 1>three cups a day and then I did it like </v>
<v Speaker 1>30 days in a row and there's one point </v>

276
00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:42.061
<v Speaker 1>in time where I didn't drink it for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and I had a headache and it was </v>

277
00:13:42.061 --> 00:13:42.061
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

278
00:13:42.061 --> 00:13:46.180
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my brain was getting accustom to </v>

279
00:13:46.271 --> 00:13:48.580
<v Speaker 1>having all these stimulants in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I realized,</v>

280
00:13:48.581 --> 00:13:49.450
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not good.</v>

281
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.790
<v Speaker 1>I got to stop that shit lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been drinking tea.</v>

282
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Brian turned me onto this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like this.</v>

283
00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.600
<v Speaker 1>You put the tea leaves in there and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put the water in there and you can </v>

284
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.040
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to like have a tea bag.</v>

285
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.810
<v Speaker 1>You get like fresh tea leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taste good.</v>

286
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:10.110
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I need something warm to </v>

287
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.110
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

288
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.940
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my friend tate,</v>

289
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.630
<v Speaker 1>he says it best.</v>

290
00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I said coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee's like a warm hug.</v>

291
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.770
<v Speaker 1>But I got addicted to coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

292
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was only for like a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

293
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.890
<v Speaker 1>a couple days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not drinking and just drinking water</v>

294
00:14:20.891 --> 00:14:22.840
<v Speaker 1>and everything was back to normal again </v>
<v Speaker 1>luckily.</v>

295
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.930
<v Speaker 1>But this was 30 days in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not 30 years in a row,</v>

296
00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine that.</v>

297
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:32.380
<v Speaker 1>But cigarettes seem to be the one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got the most nailed as to how to</v>

298
00:14:32.381 --> 00:14:35.350
<v Speaker 1>just get you fucking hooked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

299
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

300
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:42.060
<v Speaker 1>an article that I read recently where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were discussing all the different </v>

301
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.911
<v Speaker 1>additives that the government allows </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to put into cigarettes and there's </v>

302
00:14:44.911 --> 00:14:47.440
<v Speaker 1>599 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How fucking nuts is that?</v>

303
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.650
<v Speaker 1>There's 599 different chemicals and look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at them,</v>

304
00:14:51.651 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 1>unless you're some sort of a Pharma </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemists sort of a character,</v>

305
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:59.831
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to have any idea what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck they are and there's 599 of </v>

306
00:14:59.831 --> 00:14:59.831
<v Speaker 1>them in cigarettes.</v>

307
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.660
<v Speaker 1>I'd say it was just supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking tobacco.</v>

308
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

309
00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean is it a procedure or are they </v>
<v Speaker 1>preservatives?</v>

310
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it like that Russell Crowe movie,</v>

311
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:14.180
<v Speaker 1>the insider is all that shit actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to make it more addictive.</v>

312
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:20.410
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most damaging things I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about politicians is that they </v>

313
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:20.410
<v Speaker 1>never talked about cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

314
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:22.110
<v Speaker 1>they're always wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always want to talk about the ill,</v>

315
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.890
<v Speaker 1>no bad drugs out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

316
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 1>this terrible thing that can happen if </v>
<v Speaker 1>your kids get involved in drugs,</v>

317
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:32.810
<v Speaker 1>but nobody wants a banned cigarettes </v>
<v Speaker 1>like nobody ever says that.</v>

318
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:37.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's because those fucking tobacco </v>
<v Speaker 1>company spent a bankroll.</v>

319
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I spent a fuck load of money.</v>

320
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:45.350
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me go to the questions here.</v>

321
00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Is there a lot of questions and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep moving fast.</v>

322
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:53.260
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a rambling motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe were a different color shirt in the </v>

<v Speaker 1>make fun of them anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I like their stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like some other stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 1>eight because that guy single handedly </v>

344
00:16:59.621 --> 00:17:01.800
<v Speaker 1>made ed hardy shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like dad is just like,</v>

345
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:06.900
<v Speaker 1>that's the gold stamp bank Douche bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when that guy started wearing it </v>

346
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.721
<v Speaker 1>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think ed hardy was probably </v>

347
00:17:10.721 --> 00:17:10.760
<v Speaker 1>paying him a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they know that,</v>

348
00:17:10.761 --> 00:17:15.761
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just put the fucking the Douche </v>

349
00:17:15.761 --> 00:17:15.761
<v Speaker 1>label on the Ed Hardy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

350
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:21.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chick that's a one in the morning djs </v>

351

<v Speaker 1>in Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>missy,</v>

352
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.440
<v Speaker 1>and she calls them Douche Capes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the perfect way to describe </v>

353
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:29.570
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do capes.</v>

354
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glad you guys liked the raw dog show.</v>

355
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.010
<v Speaker 1>That was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was real fun.</v>

356
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:49.200
<v Speaker 1>And my coming to Australia anytime soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be in Australia next time the UFC </v>

357
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:49.820
<v Speaker 1>is going to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really can't over there for</v>

358
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.960
<v Speaker 2>just to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to fly over there.</v>

359
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too long.</v>

360
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Sixteen fucking hours in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed the shit out of it though.</v>

361
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.010
<v Speaker 2>I had a great God damn time that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>drawn.</v>

362
00:18:01.011 --> 00:18:02.550
<v Speaker 2>This man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude that's going to fight.</v>

363
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Tim Silvia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aaron Davis aspect question.</v>

364
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.270
<v Speaker 2>There's this guy who's like one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

365
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:14.130
<v Speaker 2>he one strong man competition like many </v>
<v Speaker 2>times and he's scheduled to fight.</v>

366
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:19.131
<v Speaker 2>Tim Sylvia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is a former UFC heavyweight </v>

367
00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:20.991
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at flight and everybody's </v>

368
00:18:20.991 --> 00:18:20.991
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

369
00:18:20.991 --> 00:18:21.340
<v Speaker 2>what's he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a great fight.</v>

370
00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Fight like Tim Sylvia can fight like </v>
<v Speaker 2>just kids.</v>

371
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Ray Mercer knocked him out just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's lost to a couple of different </v>

372
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.981
<v Speaker 2>guys like fate or there's a big goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between losing the fader and </v>

373
00:18:33.981 --> 00:18:35.910
<v Speaker 2>losing to a guys had one fight and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good at lifting shit.</v>

374
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.660
<v Speaker 2>That guy's gonna get his ass handed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>him if tense it.</v>

375
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Tim Silvia loses that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something wrong.</v>

376
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.350
<v Speaker 2>He's got something wrong with him and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably shouldn't fight anymore.</v>

377
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I think tim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sylvia,</v>

378
00:18:44.731 --> 00:18:47.130
<v Speaker 2>she'll be able to keep that at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

379
00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:48.810
<v Speaker 2>it all is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is big and strong.</v>

380
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just cannot see a world where Tim </v>

381
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.600
<v Speaker 2>Silvia doesn't bomb on that guy as is </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in,</v>

382
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:55.980
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

383
00:18:55.981 --> 00:18:59.370
<v Speaker 2>I could be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could just get completely overwhelmed</v>

384
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:04.580
<v Speaker 2>by the power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But technique is more important than </v>

385
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:04.580
<v Speaker 2>power and fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if one guy,</v>

386
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can hate on Tim Silvia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you want.</v>

387
00:19:07.171 --> 00:19:10.350
<v Speaker 2>The guy was the UFC heavyweight champion</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he wasn't because he sucked.</v>

388
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Go Watch his fight with Rigo Rodriguez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

389
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.370
<v Speaker 2>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch some of his fights.</v>

390
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Watched when he had kicked trey </v>
<v Speaker 2>tellerman.</v>

391
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:21.590
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking dangerous man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim Silvia is one of the most underrated</v>

392
00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:22.830
<v Speaker 2>and under look guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

393
00:19:22.831 --> 00:19:24.360
<v Speaker 2>he got knocked out by Ray Mercer.</v>

394
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:29.690
<v Speaker 2>But guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ray Mercer connects on your head like </v>

395
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:29.690
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's going out.</v>

396
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:33.140
<v Speaker 2>He definitely fucked up and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely didn't fight smart in that </v>

397
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.631
<v Speaker 2>fight without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't write them off just </v>

398
00:19:35.631 --> 00:19:38.961
<v Speaker 2>because of one performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still accomplished a lot of </v>

399
00:19:38.961 --> 00:19:41.511
<v Speaker 2>dangerous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always been a sucker for that </v>

400
00:19:41.511 --> 00:19:41.511
<v Speaker 2>overhand right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I shouldn't say a soccer,</v>

401
00:19:41.511 --> 00:19:45.951
<v Speaker 2>but he's getting hit and gotten hit with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it before Randy coture dropped him with </v>

402
00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:48.801
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where Lawsky hit them with and </v>

403
00:19:48.801 --> 00:19:48.801
<v Speaker 2>that's also obviously what ray mercer </v>
<v Speaker 2>had him with.</v>

404
00:19:48.801 --> 00:19:49.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a lazy job.</v>

405
00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:53.360
<v Speaker 2>They said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that puts an Ascii guy.</v>

406
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

407
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.380
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're jumping into the deep end of the </v>

408
00:19:59.380 --> 00:19:59.380
<v Speaker 2>pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

409
00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.450
<v Speaker 2>Tim Silva is not that old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim Silvia has had some tough fights,</v>

410
00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:02.490
<v Speaker 2>but not that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

411
00:20:02.491 --> 00:20:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I think that's going to be a real tough </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight for that push guy.</v>

412
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.210
<v Speaker 2>I could be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be wrong.</v>

413
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.690
<v Speaker 2>He might do those running fucking leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks like it did to that other dude.</v>

414
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.700
<v Speaker 2>We're just basically ran out on like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bowl,</v>

415
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.660
<v Speaker 2>but that other guy comparing him to Tim </v>
<v Speaker 2>Silvia is just ridiculous.</v>

416
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.680
<v Speaker 2>He's smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not as nearly as experienced.</v>

417
00:20:18.681 --> 00:20:20.220
<v Speaker 2>He's just a boxer is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

418
00:20:20.221 --> 00:20:25.221
<v Speaker 2>there's so many differences between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first guy who fought and fighting the </v>

419
00:20:25.221 --> 00:20:26.160
<v Speaker 2>UFC heavyweight champ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking,</v>

420
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:31.550
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might not even get to him because </v>

421
00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:31.550
<v Speaker 2>he's got to fight in between that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a fight.</v>

422
00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before that.</v>

423
00:20:32.401 --> 00:20:37.401
<v Speaker 2>I think in April he's fighting someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else and he's going to fight him silly </v>

424
00:20:37.401 --> 00:20:41.510
<v Speaker 2>right after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might not beat that guy that he's </v>

425
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.510
<v Speaker 2>fighting in April.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

426
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.530
<v Speaker 2>if a guy knows how to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

427
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:46.570
<v Speaker 2>just a big goddamn difference between a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who's just strong and he's gonna </v>

428
00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:46.570
<v Speaker 2>leave openings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

429
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he leaves open,</v>

430
00:20:47.951 --> 00:20:48.220
<v Speaker 2>someone's</v>

431
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.290
<v Speaker 1>going to catch on and as soon as you got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to catch them,</v>

432
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:53.050
<v Speaker 1>you can't put muscles in your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

433
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what kind of a </v>

434
00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:58.080
<v Speaker 1>background he has and fighting other </v>
<v Speaker 1>than being super strong,</v>

435
00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.220
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't look like much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived real stiff.</v>

436
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.570
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once he hits you,</v>

437
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 1>if he gets a hold of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts hitting you,</v>

438
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:08.010
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's all that before he gets a hold </v>

439
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:08.010
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuff that's like,</v>

440
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.160
<v Speaker 1>it's all Herky Jerky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

441
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.750
<v Speaker 1>all muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no technique,</v>

442
00:21:10.751 --> 00:21:12.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

443
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:17.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're guys that strong last </v>

444
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.190
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll learn a few techniques,</v>

445
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.640
<v Speaker 1>get them really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

446
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:24.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a guy that </v>

447
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:24.010
<v Speaker 1>literally is one of the strongest men to</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk the planet.</v>

448
00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:29.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could teach that guy to start </v>

449
00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:29.180
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

450
00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.860
<v Speaker 1>some solid wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach that guy like it's just a good </v>

451
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:31.860
<v Speaker 1>amount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

452
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.820
<v Speaker 1>just a few moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just teach them how to keep his hands </v>

453
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:35.820
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close the distance,</v>

454
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.901
<v Speaker 1>teach them some take downs and teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to get on top of dudes and just </v>

455
00:21:39.901 --> 00:21:40.930
<v Speaker 1>smash their fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

456
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.880
<v Speaker 1>a guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you taught them some shit,</v>

457
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:47.180
<v Speaker 1>he would only need a few things just </v>

<v Speaker 1>balls until his balls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like literally died.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like dead and gray.</v>

469
00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.620

<v Speaker 2>with these girls that they would want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put is like,</v>

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.650
<v Speaker 2>But who has something to lose in </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparison to him though?</v>

575
00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:03.300
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a guy like that,</v>

576
00:28:03.301 --> 00:28:05.670
<v Speaker 2>you can never trust anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

577
00:28:05.671 --> 00:28:06.850
<v Speaker 2>if that's what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a,</v>

578
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.100
<v Speaker 2>a wild guy that likes to cheat on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife and you're a fucking billionaire,</v>

579
00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.880
<v Speaker 2>super squeaky clean character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck can you trust?</v>

580
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.310
<v Speaker 2>Like that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

581
00:28:17.311 --> 00:28:22.311
<v Speaker 2>I want to predict that he would have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go somewhere where they didn't know who </v>

582
00:28:22.311 --> 00:28:25.021
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd have to go to like Malaysia to </v>

583
00:28:25.021 --> 00:28:25.021
<v Speaker 2>cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poor Fella.</v>

584
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.870
<v Speaker 2>Poor Fella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

585
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:29.940
<v Speaker 2>What do I think at James?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony.</v>

586
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:34.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm disturbed by James.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony is his recent speeches,</v>

587
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:35.760
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um.</v>

588
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's going on with him </v>

589
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:41.100
<v Speaker 2>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

590
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he wants to fight heavyweight.</v>

591
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.700
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says he wants to fight Brock Lesnar.</v>

592
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:50.180
<v Speaker 2>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe the best thing to do to </v>

593
00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:50.190
<v Speaker 2>get this over with and just give him </v>
<v Speaker 2>brock lesnar.</v>

594
00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean if Dave James,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony Loses to somebody.</v>

595
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.470
<v Speaker 2>The way I look at it as like James,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony,</v>

596
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.280
<v Speaker 2>obviously all the respect in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a boxer of all time,</v>

597
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:03.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really one of the craftiest guys to come</v>

598
00:29:03.421 --> 00:29:07.230
<v Speaker 2>along in decades and a guy who really </v>
<v Speaker 2>utilize that old,</v>

599
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:11.400
<v Speaker 2>like Archie Moore shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulder roll style,</v>

600
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.600
<v Speaker 2>like had a real classic old timers </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing style,</v>

601
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.810
<v Speaker 2>like real good at like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like rolling with punches.</v>

602
00:29:18.811 --> 00:29:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Then coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just counter right hand is against</v>

603
00:29:21.181 --> 00:29:23.910
<v Speaker 2>John Ruiz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a youtube clip of him.</v>

604
00:29:23.911 --> 00:29:28.911
<v Speaker 2>Like you see how beautiful his timing </v>
<v Speaker 2>was and like when he just destroyed </v>

605
00:29:28.911 --> 00:29:29.910
<v Speaker 2>evander holyfield in their fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

606
00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:33.270
<v Speaker 2>he's a so he's so skillful as a boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

607
00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:38.271
<v Speaker 2>very skillful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's so much more to mma than </v>

608
00:29:38.271 --> 00:29:43.221
<v Speaker 2>just boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not hearing about him going to </v>

609
00:29:43.221 --> 00:29:45.990
<v Speaker 2>American top team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hearing about him going to team </v>

610
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:45.990
<v Speaker 2>quest.</v>

611
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:47.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hearing about him going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

612
00:29:47.561 --> 00:29:51.070
<v Speaker 2>to like high level camps to work with </v>
<v Speaker 2>big wrestlers to get.</v>

613
00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:56.071
<v Speaker 2>I tried to take him down because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise I'm hearing him say he's gonna</v>

614
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.190
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brock Lesnar,</v>

615
00:29:57.191 --> 00:30:02.191
<v Speaker 2>I'm hearing one of two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm either here and he doesn't give a </v>

616
00:30:02.191 --> 00:30:05.131
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just here to get paid or I'm </v>

617
00:30:05.131 --> 00:30:07.051
<v Speaker 2>hearing he is crazy and he thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be able to stop brock </v>

618
00:30:07.051 --> 00:30:09.040
<v Speaker 2>lesnar from taking them down by hitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>him with a punch.</v>

619
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.340
<v Speaker 2>The either one is not good because one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them means he's delusional.</v>

620
00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:17.370
<v Speaker 2>That he doesn't really understand what </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all about and the other one </v>

621
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:18.670
<v Speaker 2>means that he's just a guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for money.</v>

622
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Either one is not that good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

623
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

624
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Boxing is a tough Goddamn game and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been in it,</v>

625
00:30:25.621 --> 00:30:30.621
<v Speaker 2>as long as James Tony as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though he doesn't take that much </v>

626
00:30:30.621 --> 00:30:30.621
<v Speaker 2>punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

627
00:30:30.621 --> 00:30:34.381
<v Speaker 2>you gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta realize these guys at a </v>

628
00:30:34.381 --> 00:30:34.381
<v Speaker 2>certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

629
00:30:34.381 --> 00:30:37.060
<v Speaker 2>they only have the only have a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount more punches you can take,</v>

630
00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a certain.</v>

631
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.840
<v Speaker 2>There's a finite number after that </v>
<v Speaker 2>number,</v>

632
00:30:40.841 --> 00:30:42.370
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

633
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:47.400
<v Speaker 2>and I think that the thing with James </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony is he has this incredible </v>

634
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.841
<v Speaker 2>confidence in his hands and he really </v>
<v Speaker 2>truly believes that if a guy like brock </v>

635
00:30:52.001 --> 00:30:53.410
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tries to take him down,</v>

636
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:55.930
<v Speaker 2>that he's going to be able to connect in</v>
<v Speaker 2>with those little gloves,</v>

637
00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:01.020
<v Speaker 2>he's going to put them to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's looks a lot easier than it </v>

638
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:01.810
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>

639
00:31:01.811 --> 00:31:04.660
<v Speaker 2>I think if he starts training with high </v>
<v Speaker 2>level guys,</v>

640
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.400
<v Speaker 2>he goes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work out with,</v>

641
00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:11.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a chemo workout with some of my high </v>

642
00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:11.470
<v Speaker 2>level wrestlers and see how easy it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>for those guys that take you down.</v>

643
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:16.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think you're just going to catch up </v>

644
00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.871
<v Speaker 2>with an upper cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't throw punches the same way </v>

645
00:31:17.871 --> 00:31:17.920
<v Speaker 2>when you're worried about a guy taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>you down.</v>

646
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.600
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The timing is not the same.</v>

647
00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.240
<v Speaker 2>You can't stand the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you stand the same way,</v>

648
00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:25.150
<v Speaker 2>they're going to kick your legs out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to take you down easy.</v>

649
00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:28.600
<v Speaker 2>So you have to change your stance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I have to change your stance as a</v>

650
00:31:28.601 --> 00:31:31.000
<v Speaker 2>boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to constantly be thinking about</v>

651
00:31:31.001 --> 00:31:36.001
<v Speaker 2>sprawling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly be thinking about getting </v>

652
00:31:36.001 --> 00:31:36.001
<v Speaker 2>your under hook set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

653
00:31:36.001 --> 00:31:39.631
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the punching ability that he </v>

654
00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:41.440
<v Speaker 2>asks is a huge plus and it'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely,</v>

655
00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:45.340
<v Speaker 2>if anybody is stupid enough to not try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take them down and just box with him,</v>

656
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:50.490
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get your clock cleaned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know for sure he's going to hit you </v>

657
00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:53.581
<v Speaker 2>with some precise counter punches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to take advantage of little </v>

658
00:31:53.581 --> 00:31:57.421
<v Speaker 2>tiny minute openings because really he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a high level box or we don't see </v>

659
00:31:57.911 --> 00:32:00.430
<v Speaker 2>that high level striker in the octagon.</v>

660
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:04.690
<v Speaker 2>He can make God look foolish if somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>chose some crazy boxer,</v>

661
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:09.800
<v Speaker 2>you know in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy who's got good hands chose to try </v>

662
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:09.850
<v Speaker 2>to stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just stand up with James,</v>

663
00:32:09.851 --> 00:32:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would make them look like a fool.</v>

664
00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.880
<v Speaker 2>He really would really demoralized that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would talk shit to them.</v>

665
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.100
<v Speaker 2>He was bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>

666
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:23.790
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would keep just land and punches </v>

667
00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:23.790
<v Speaker 2>on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He will fuck your world up,</v>

668
00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:24.910
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

669
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.680
<v Speaker 2>I think guys are going to do one or two </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

670
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:30.850
<v Speaker 2>They're going to kick the living fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of his legs or they're just going to</v>

671
00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:33.550
<v Speaker 2>take them now and I don't think he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to mail stop that.</v>

672
00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's going to stop though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

673
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he got like a,</v>

674
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.820
<v Speaker 2>a big Jujitsu guy gets all the women </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

675
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:41.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

676
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:43.610
<v Speaker 2>like Nepal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gabriel,</v>

677
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:44.990
<v Speaker 2>Gonzaga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gabriel,</v>

678
00:32:44.991 --> 00:32:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Gonzaga got a hold of Jesus Christ.</v>

679
00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.820
<v Speaker 2>He might just start breaking pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them off,</v>

680
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.770
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if God help him,</v>

681
00:32:51.771 --> 00:32:54.680
<v Speaker 2>if Brock Lesnar wants to take them down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

682
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.570
<v Speaker 2>we can't just catch that guy with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>punch.</v>

683
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.940
<v Speaker 2>That's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

684
00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:03.970
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's enough for your average regular </v>

685
00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:03.970
<v Speaker 2>human brock lesnar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

686
00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:08.280
<v Speaker 2>that's a freak of a man that's like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>high end of the genetic spectrum or you </v>

687

<v Speaker 2>to Frank Mir and then still get to the </v>

768
00:36:41.701 --> 00:36:42.830
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

769
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:47.870
<v Speaker 2>when you're 290 fucking plus pounds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle and your bodies covered with </v>

770
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
<v Speaker 2>swords,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got like swords and skulls and </v>

771
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.690
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all like axes and swords and </v>

772
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.121
<v Speaker 2>destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually says kill them all and his </v>

773
00:36:59.121 --> 00:36:59.760
<v Speaker 2>lower back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a like a tramp stamp that says,</v>

774
00:36:59.761 --> 00:37:00.840
<v Speaker 2>kill 'em.</v>

775
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.810
<v Speaker 2>All Eem all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

776
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.890
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's that?</v>

777
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:09.290
<v Speaker 2>Therefore it's a scary fucking dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

778
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:13.440
<v Speaker 2>That's a real angry motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's real interesting to see,</v>

779
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:15.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to.</v>

780
00:37:15.061 --> 00:37:18.600
<v Speaker 2>I really want to see him versus fate or </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a very,</v>

781
00:37:18.601 --> 00:37:23.601
<v Speaker 2>very intriguing fight to me because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>represent such polar opposites in fate </v>

782
00:37:24.271 --> 00:37:25.800
<v Speaker 2>or you have a guidance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

783
00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:29.310
<v Speaker 2>relatively small heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just about six feet tall.</v>

784
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:34.400
<v Speaker 2>He weighs about 2:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's got a considerable amount of </v>

785
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:34.400
<v Speaker 2>fat on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

786
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.380
<v Speaker 2>I would say like probably at least 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds of fat.</v>

787
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Like he's got a lot of jiggly fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't try to lose weight at all.</v>

788
00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:41.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just says,</v>

789
00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm a heavy weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>

790
00:37:43.141 --> 00:37:44.790
<v Speaker 2>This is what I weigh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fight as a heavyweight.</v>

791
00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:47.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a broad contrast between him,</v>

792
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:50.550
<v Speaker 2>his personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very stoic.</v>

793
00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.770
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never see any expression out of him.</v>

794
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:57.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody like comments on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that the dude like never seemed </v>

795
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:58.350
<v Speaker 2>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never makes a mean face.</v>

796
00:37:58.351 --> 00:38:03.351
<v Speaker 2>Never seen it her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter if he's cut or no matter if </v>

797
00:38:03.351 --> 00:38:03.351
<v Speaker 2>he's got the guy hurt and he's finishing</v>
<v Speaker 2>them off,</v>

798
00:38:03.351 --> 00:38:07.950
<v Speaker 2>he's just got this dead expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Brock Lesner is giant.</v>

799
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Dantic has to cut weight to make to 65.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a guy who,</v>

800
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:17.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is at the very top of the weight class </v>

801
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:18.870
<v Speaker 2>and he's a guy who is just flooded with </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion,</v>

802
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.570
<v Speaker 2>flooded with anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flooded with expression.</v>

803
00:38:21.571 --> 00:38:26.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean he wears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is one of those no nonsense </v>

804
00:38:26.571 --> 00:38:27.450
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wears who he is out on his sleeve,</v>

805
00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:32.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he likes to talk a little shit and </v>

806
00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:34.230
<v Speaker 2>he gets angry at people and he likes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>swear and you know,</v>

807
00:38:34.231 --> 00:38:39.231
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he likes to stick the bird out the </v>

808
00:38:39.231 --> 00:38:39.231
<v Speaker 2>audience and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they bloom,</v>

809
00:38:39.231 --> 00:38:40.390
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

810
00:38:40.391 --> 00:38:42.040

<v Speaker 2>he's a totally different dude.</v>

811
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:47.370
<v Speaker 2>I'd be very curious to see those two </v>
<v Speaker 2>approaches and see which one would </v>

812
00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:49.090
<v Speaker 2>ultimately prevail because it's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

813
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:54.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not fair because brock is so </v>

814
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:57.661
<v Speaker 2>much goddamn bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brock is a lean to 65 and when he's 65,</v>

815
00:38:59.081 --> 00:39:00.880
<v Speaker 2>he's cutting a little weight to get down</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

816
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:02.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll drop some waterway,</v>

817

<v Speaker 2>15 pounds,</v>

818
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get down.</v>

819
00:39:05.321 --> 00:39:06.670
<v Speaker 2>So He's inflated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

820
00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:09.520
<v Speaker 2>well up to like to 80 by the time he </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually gets into the octagon.</v>

821
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just solid as a fucking house at two 80,</v>

822
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.560
<v Speaker 2>whereas fader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

823
00:39:14.561 --> 00:39:19.561
<v Speaker 2>at 2:30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's 50 pounds less is not nearly as </v>

824
00:39:19.561 --> 00:39:20.130
<v Speaker 2>solid fader at 2:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

825
00:39:20.131 --> 00:39:21.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's jiggly w,</v>

826
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:24.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter if you connect to your</v>

827
00:39:24.011 --> 00:39:26.320
<v Speaker 2>face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know he's a bad ass puncher.</v>

828
00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.140
<v Speaker 2>His jujitsu is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His grappling is fantastic.</v>

829
00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.730
<v Speaker 2>He's great off of his back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a.</v>

830
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:34.330
<v Speaker 2>that's a big difference man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

831
00:39:34.331 --> 00:39:39.331
<v Speaker 2>when all things are equal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying they are skill wise </v>

832
00:39:39.331 --> 00:39:40.870
<v Speaker 2>because I do not believe they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Faye doors more skillful and has</v>

833
00:39:40.871 --> 00:39:44.710
<v Speaker 2>more options to win the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but progress so fucking big.</v>

834
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:50.160
<v Speaker 2>He's so much bigger when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about 50 pounds of bone and muscle 50 </v>

835
00:39:51.221 --> 00:39:54.160
<v Speaker 2>fucking pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a significant advantage.</v>

836
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:57.070
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that you're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a guy who's this freak athlete,</v>

837
00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that he's big like big and</v>

838
00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:04.681
<v Speaker 2>lumbering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they've had guys that were big and </v>

839
00:40:04.681 --> 00:40:04.681
<v Speaker 2>lumbering dudes that have fought in mma </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

840
00:40:04.681 --> 00:40:06.520
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were never like this motherfucker.</v>

841
00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.130
<v Speaker 2>The way brock moves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he moves like a light guy,</v>

842
00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:12.220
<v Speaker 2>even though he's a giant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a freak athlete,</v>

843
00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

844
00:40:13.271 --> 00:40:17.350

<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy warrior tribe.</v>

845
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.980
<v Speaker 2>That's why he's got all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

846
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.160

<v Speaker 2>A lot of it got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's my answer to that question.</v>

848
00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the going off of</v>

849
00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:37.180
<v Speaker 1>the Ustream Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to go to the Joe Rogan </v>

<v Speaker 1>We'll see what kind of questions we got </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in that bitch.</v>

852
00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Got Two pages of questions and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them were joke questions.</v>

853
00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.110
<v Speaker 1>Jokey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokey joke.</v>

854
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Bb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John says,</v>

855
00:41:02.461 --> 00:41:03.780
<v Speaker 2>Hey Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you know?</v>

856
00:41:03.781 --> 00:41:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

857
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Is that a rhetorical question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

858
00:41:07.671 --> 00:41:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

859
00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not enough my friend.</v>

860
00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:12.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not enough.</v>

861
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Nor do any of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the great unfortunate truth.</v>

862
00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about the pope knowing </v>

863
00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:28.820
<v Speaker 1>that child sex abuse was going on and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't say anything about it when he was</v>

864
00:41:28.821 --> 00:41:33.200
<v Speaker 1>a priest in Germany?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're all fucking freaks.</v>

865
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:34.250
<v Speaker 1>I think there's</v>

866
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:39.280
<v Speaker 2>only one way you can be a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>dedicates her entire life to not having </v>

867
00:41:39.381 --> 00:41:42.650
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only way is you're a sexual deviant.</v>

868
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:47.920
<v Speaker 2>There's something wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe there's any priest that </v>

869
00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:51.051
<v Speaker 2>aren't really completely fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one of the craziest ways </v>

870
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:53.420
<v Speaker 2>that anyone could ever make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a living,</v>

871
00:41:53.421 --> 00:41:55.850
<v Speaker 2>get through life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

872
00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.100
<v Speaker 2>You're a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking priest,</v>

873
00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:03.520
<v Speaker 2>so wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you get to a different heaven than </v>

874
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:03.520
<v Speaker 2>the people that get posted and get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a good time?</v>

875
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to the same heaven,</v>

876
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:10.090
<v Speaker 2>so by doing what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what everybody has to listen to you and </v>

877
00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:10.310
<v Speaker 2>give you money and you get to fuck the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

878
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:15.430
<v Speaker 2>Like what is that about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense because it </v>

879
00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.830
<v Speaker 2>totally goes against what the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion should be all about.</v>

880
00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Religion should be all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like God's word to everyone on how </v>

881
00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:24.360
<v Speaker 2>to live your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did.</v>

882
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:26.720
<v Speaker 2>How come these guys that spread God's </v>
<v Speaker 2>word,</v>

883
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:29.000
<v Speaker 2>they don't get to have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that about?</v>

884
00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:30.140
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do they?</v>

885
00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:31.640
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are they so fucked up?</v>

886
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:36.790
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because initially preset too much </v>

887
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.790
<v Speaker 2>goddamn power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

888
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:38.480
<v Speaker 2>a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>priests were allowed to have sex,</v>

889
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:41.870
<v Speaker 2>but the problem was they were fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone because those are the guys that</v>

890
00:42:41.871 --> 00:42:44.840
<v Speaker 2>were in charge of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were the guys that were talking to</v>

891
00:42:44.841 --> 00:42:46.970
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were the guys that were.</v>

892
00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.830
<v Speaker 2>They were at the front of the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>God line.</v>

893
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:55.960
<v Speaker 2>They had the Willy Wonka golden ticket </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were reading the word of God </v>

894
00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.580
<v Speaker 2>and in a village,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know of several hundred people,</v>

895
00:42:58.581 --> 00:43:03.581
<v Speaker 2>the guy who's the fucking priest who </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaks the word of God and has to </v>

896
00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:07.570
<v Speaker 2>console all these women and you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe these women there with husbands </v>

897
00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:10.930
<v Speaker 2>that are tired of fucking him and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>priest would love to take step in and </v>

898
00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:10.930
<v Speaker 2>take some of that.</v>

899
00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:13.070
<v Speaker 2>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you some God knowledge.</v>

900
00:43:13.071 --> 00:43:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Now you give me some head and that shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going on left and right.</v>

901
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:18.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's why priest camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

902
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:23.650
<v Speaker 2>The reason why priests aren't a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck is because they were fucking </v>

903
00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:23.650
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>

904
00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:24.570
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the hell wants to be present?</v>

905
00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:25.970
<v Speaker 2>You can't fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

906
00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Once they told him they couldn't fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

907
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:32.530
<v Speaker 2>what did they do while they probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them probably kept fucking and </v>

908
00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:32.530
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

909
00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:32.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll stop.</v>

910
00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:37.060
<v Speaker 2>And they kept banging people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they got caught and they probably </v>

911
00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:37.060
<v Speaker 2>got flogged or something terrible like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

912
00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:41.830
<v Speaker 2>And so then they really cracked down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>made sure that the priests are not </v>

913
00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:41.830
<v Speaker 2>allowed to have sex anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

914
00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:46.061
<v Speaker 2>once they started doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the only people that want to be </v>

915
00:43:46.061 --> 00:43:48.911
<v Speaker 2>priests were either gays who could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>with other priests and they just keep it</v>

916
00:43:49.251 --> 00:43:54.251
<v Speaker 2>on the sneak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sneak and bag each other or pedophiles </v>

917
00:43:54.251 --> 00:43:54.350
<v Speaker 2>because they had access to all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

918
00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:59.030
<v Speaker 2>These children had listened to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The overwhelming amount,</v>

919
00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:04.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hurts your head to think about how </v>

920
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:06.830
<v Speaker 2>many fucking kids had been sexually </v>
<v Speaker 2>abused by the Catholic Church.</v>

921
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really hurts your head.</v>

922
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:15.190
<v Speaker 2>It really hurts to think that all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are so blinded by a fucking fairy</v>

923
00:44:15.711 --> 00:44:20.711
<v Speaker 2>tale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're willing to let some </v>

924
00:44:20.711 --> 00:44:22.361
<v Speaker 2>criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some monster fuck their kids after all </v>

925
00:44:22.361 --> 00:44:26.711
<v Speaker 2>these years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that that is still going on </v>

926
00:44:26.711 --> 00:44:30.160
<v Speaker 2>that is mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is mind boggling that we pay any </v>

927
00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.540
<v Speaker 2>attention to this silly caught and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one can save this.</v>

928
00:44:33.541 --> 00:44:38.541
<v Speaker 2>No politician can say this because for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure no one's going to vote for you if </v>

929
00:44:38.541 --> 00:44:41.460
<v Speaker 2>you come out and say this is nonsense </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if there is a god for sure.</v>

930
00:44:41.461 --> 00:44:44.160
<v Speaker 2>These are not his words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the word of man.</v>

931
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.190
<v Speaker 2>How the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you just analyze religion.</v>

932
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:52.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean just as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean let's let's say that once upon a </v>

933
00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:53.340
<v Speaker 2>time it was word of the word of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows?</v>

934
00:44:53.341 --> 00:44:54.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>

935
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:55.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there really is a god,</v>

936
00:44:55.950 --> 00:45:00.950
<v Speaker 2>I always say that I've done things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were so much crazier than the stories </v>

937
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:04.971
<v Speaker 2>that people tell about heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you smoke DMT and you've </v>

938
00:45:04.971 --> 00:45:08.540
<v Speaker 2>communicated and another dimension with </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings that are made out of love and </v>

939
00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.110
<v Speaker 2>understanding and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're super knowledgeable.</v>

940
00:45:10.111 --> 00:45:12.180
<v Speaker 2>They know everything about life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything about you.</v>

941
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:17.300
<v Speaker 2>When you've seen something like that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone wants to talk to you and tell </v>

942
00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:17.300
<v Speaker 2>you that they've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

943
00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:21.410
<v Speaker 2>a guy in the cloud with a harp and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are you to tell him that he's full of </v>

944
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:24.471
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about something that </v>

945
00:45:24.471 --> 00:45:24.471
<v Speaker 2>you've actually experienced that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually experienced.</v>

946
00:45:24.471 --> 00:45:27.990
<v Speaker 2>It's way more fucking crazy than angels </v>
<v Speaker 2>with wings and a dude in the clouds with</v>

947
00:45:27.991 --> 00:45:29.970
<v Speaker 2>a big book of who gets in and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't.</v>

948
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:35.330
<v Speaker 2>That's way less crazy than the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've actually experienced and this </v>

949
00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:37.680
<v Speaker 2>thing that you actually experienced when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you die.</v>

950
00:45:37.681 --> 00:45:42.681
<v Speaker 2>This dmt to stuff that when you die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what your brain produces when </v>

951
00:45:42.681 --> 00:45:47.451
<v Speaker 2>you're in heavy rem sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what your brain produces a </v>

952
00:45:47.451 --> 00:45:49.911
<v Speaker 2>natural part of human neurochemistry and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it lets you see something way crazier </v>

953
00:45:49.911 --> 00:45:50.910
<v Speaker 2>than what these religious people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

954
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.640
<v Speaker 2>So who am I to say that there's no god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There may be.</v>

955
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there is a fucking village and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>clouds.</v>

956
00:45:55.351 --> 00:46:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's all true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just studying the actual words.</v>

957
00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.630
<v Speaker 2>If you know the the history of how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bible was made,</v>

958
00:46:03.631 --> 00:46:07.740
<v Speaker 2>that the ancient ancient Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which will be the original Old Testament</v>

959
00:46:07.741 --> 00:46:10.440
<v Speaker 2>was written in the original Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>written ancient Hebrew,</v>

960
00:46:10.441 --> 00:46:12.240
<v Speaker 2>was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To this day,</v>

961
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:16.050
<v Speaker 2>they only know three out of four of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those words for this day,</v>

962
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:21.200
<v Speaker 2>like today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 percent of the words in ancient </v>

963
00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Hebrew.</v>

964
00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:21.200
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows?</v>

965
00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Not only that there was no numbers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient Hebrew letters doubled as </v>

966
00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:29.160
<v Speaker 2>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like the letter a was also the number</v>

967
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:34.161
<v Speaker 2>one and there was numerical value to </v>
<v Speaker 2>words that is completely lost in the </v>

968
00:46:34.951 --> 00:46:39.951
<v Speaker 2>translation to Greek and Latin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the word law of the word love and </v>

969
00:46:39.951 --> 00:46:44.550
<v Speaker 2>the word of God have the same numerical </v>
<v Speaker 2>value and this numerical value,</v>

970
00:46:44.551 --> 00:46:49.551
<v Speaker 2>the value of these words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it was very important to the </v>

971
00:46:49.551 --> 00:46:49.860
<v Speaker 2>translation of what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

972
00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.060
<v Speaker 2>what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was meant.</v>

973
00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:56.550
<v Speaker 2>All that is missing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they translated that and then </v>

974
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:57.210
<v Speaker 2>eventually to English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that's missing,</v>

975
00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:01.650
<v Speaker 2>and then you got the New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just complete wackiness because</v>

976
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.520
<v Speaker 2>constantine who wasn't even a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian created this,</v>

977
00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:08.490
<v Speaker 2>and this is just clearly a ploy to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to control people.</v>

978
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:13.610
<v Speaker 2>Constantine got together with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>bishops and they wrote it all out and </v>

979
00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:14.490
<v Speaker 2>there's stuff that they left in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff they stick out.</v>

980
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:19.550
<v Speaker 2>So the New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is literally made hundreds of </v>

981
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:19.550
<v Speaker 2>years after Christ was supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

982
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows what that's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>

983
00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:26.450
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But only you need to know is the guy </v>

984
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.450
<v Speaker 2>even wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even a Christian.</v>

985
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Like right before he died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He converted unbelieve and you know it </v>

986
00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:33.261
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very constantine won and he was </v>

987
00:47:33.261 --> 00:47:33.850
<v Speaker 2>an emperor or you want to control people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what it's best at.</v>

988
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:38.851
<v Speaker 2>It's so good at controlling people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll let pedophiles fuck your kids </v>

989
00:47:38.851 --> 00:47:41.140
<v Speaker 2>because they have the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the magic fairytale golden ticket.</v>

990
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:46.380
<v Speaker 2>It's mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mind boggling that this goofy fuck </v>

991
00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:49.570
<v Speaker 2>in a crazy outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This cult leader gets special treatment.</v>

992
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.780
<v Speaker 2>They'll make fun of the moonies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll make fun of scientologists,</v>

993
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:57.870
<v Speaker 2>but the fucking pope on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow another gets to be national </v>

994
00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:01.441
<v Speaker 2>news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this crazy fuck who's not allowed to </v>

995
00:48:01.441 --> 00:48:04.171
<v Speaker 2>have sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who hangs out with a bunch of crazy Fox </v>

996
00:48:04.171 --> 00:48:05.410
<v Speaker 2>who aren't allowed to have sex and every</v>
<v Speaker 2>rock you fucking pick up.</v>

997
00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:07.450
<v Speaker 2>There's a priest fucking a kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath it.</v>

998
00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:12.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just throughout their entire </v>

999
00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.421
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are thousands and thousands and </v>

1000
00:48:15.421 --> 00:48:18.541
<v Speaker 2>thousands of cases every fucking year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New ones pop up every fucking year.</v>

1001
00:48:19.121 --> 00:48:24.121
<v Speaker 2>Some new scandal about how they knew </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was fucking kids and so they </v>

1002
00:48:24.121 --> 00:48:25.540
<v Speaker 2>moved him to New Mexico or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1003
00:48:25.541 --> 00:48:30.541
<v Speaker 2>it's really shocking that Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are even going to church anymore.</v>

1004
00:48:31.601 --> 00:48:35.310
<v Speaker 2>It's completely shocking that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>still people that they trick.</v>

1005
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Just the sheer weight of its own </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit should have collapsed the </v>

1006
00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Catholic religion a long fucking time </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago and this is coming from someone who </v>

1007
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:48.211
<v Speaker 2>was raised a Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Catholic school when I was in </v>

1008
00:48:48.211 --> 00:48:51.631
<v Speaker 2>first grade one year I went to Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>school and it was such a fucking </v>

1009
00:48:51.631 --> 00:48:53.980
<v Speaker 2>horrendous nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember second grade,</v>

1010
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:56.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember first grade though,</v>

1011
00:48:56.770 --> 00:49:01.770
<v Speaker 2>like a motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because first grade was the only year </v>

1012
00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:01.770
<v Speaker 2>that I was in Catholic school.</v>

1013
00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I remember this fucking cunt sister Mary</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josephine's is evil,</v>

1014
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:08.200
<v Speaker 2>evil woman who used to tell you that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't get your homework done,</v>

1015
00:49:08.201 --> 00:49:11.320
<v Speaker 2>you have to sit on a nail in the closet </v>
<v Speaker 2>overnight.</v>

1016
00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:13.480
<v Speaker 2>She would smack you in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1017
00:49:13.481 --> 00:49:15.430
<v Speaker 2>it was real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you cried,</v>

1018
00:49:15.431 --> 00:49:17.620
<v Speaker 2>if you were upset about something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would make fun of you.</v>

1019
00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:18.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it.</v>

1020
00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:21.940
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was just no compassion,</v>

1021
00:49:21.941 --> 00:49:24.760
<v Speaker 2>no love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no friendship,</v>

1022
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:27.700
<v Speaker 2>no warmth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all evil.</v>

1023
00:49:27.701 --> 00:49:31.840
<v Speaker 2>It was all anger and evil and that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what that relationship is.</v>

1024
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:34.630
<v Speaker 2>It is unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not real.</v>

1025
00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:39.690
<v Speaker 2>This relationship to life where you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>person who's in charge of some nonsense </v>

1026
00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:44.071
<v Speaker 2>fairytale and because of that you get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit on people and yell at their kids </v>

1027
00:49:44.071 --> 00:49:47.730
<v Speaker 2>and hit their fucking kids and treat </v>
<v Speaker 2>them like shit because you somehow or </v>

1028
00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:52.591
<v Speaker 2>another are special because you're one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those people that doesn't fuck and </v>

1029
00:49:52.591 --> 00:49:52.790
<v Speaker 2>you have what?</v>

1030
00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:55.720
<v Speaker 2>You have more access to God and I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have more access.</v>

1031
00:49:55.721 --> 00:49:56.530
<v Speaker 2>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If anything,</v>

1032
00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:01.480
<v Speaker 2>it's the craziest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most ridiculous cult ever and it's still</v>

1033
00:50:01.481 --> 00:50:06.481
<v Speaker 2>going on and if that's not a a damning </v>
<v Speaker 2>condemnation of human beings and human </v>

1034
00:50:06.481 --> 00:50:10.870
<v Speaker 2>culture today in 2010 with the age of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information with the Internet,</v>

1035
00:50:10.871 --> 00:50:12.850
<v Speaker 2>with all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we still have the Catholic religion</v>

1036
00:50:12.851 --> 00:50:15.880
<v Speaker 2>that that stupid shit is still around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mind boggling.</v>

1037
00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there is a god that's not what he </v>

1038
00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:21.540
<v Speaker 2>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there is a god,</v>

1039
00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.570
<v Speaker 2>what God is is the energy that creates </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you know.</v>

1040
00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:28.650
<v Speaker 2>It might not be a conscious thing or it </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be all conscious things together </v>

1041
00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:33.101
<v Speaker 2>as one thing in some sort of a framework</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can't even recognize because </v>

1042
00:50:33.101 --> 00:50:34.580
<v Speaker 2>it's so big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so great that literally,</v>

1043
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:36.080
<v Speaker 2>you know when someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some hippie says,</v>

1044
00:50:36.081 --> 00:50:38.050
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are God and God's you would.</v>

1045
00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:40.370
<v Speaker 2>If that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if that really is true?</v>

1046
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:45.490
<v Speaker 2>What if our purpose on this life has </v>
<v Speaker 2>shielded us from that recognition </v>

1047
00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:48.140
<v Speaker 2>because we have to go through whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to go through it like we're here</v>

1048
00:50:48.141 --> 00:50:53.141
<v Speaker 2>for a reason that we're pushing humanity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and human culture and human innovation </v>

1049
00:50:53.141 --> 00:50:54.220
<v Speaker 2>forward for reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1050
00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:59.260
<v Speaker 2>probably some sort of fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a technological thing that </v>

1051
00:50:59.260 --> 00:50:59.990
<v Speaker 2>we're going to create that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>enter us into the new age.</v>

1052
00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.770
<v Speaker 2>But if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said that we just lacked a perception</v>

1053
00:51:03.771 --> 00:51:05.960
<v Speaker 2>to really understand that we're in tune </v>
<v Speaker 2>with anything,</v>

1054
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:07.340
<v Speaker 2>with everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the whole world.</v>

1055
00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Then that makes sense that everything is</v>
<v Speaker 2>God and that's the feeling that you get </v>

1056
00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:14.120
<v Speaker 2>when you do mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you do mushrooms,</v>

1057
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:19.300
<v Speaker 2>you get this feeling of connectedness </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you are attached when you do dmt as</v>

1058
00:51:19.551 --> 00:51:21.930
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very similar to,</v>

1059
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:24.560
<v Speaker 2>to mushrooms in what it is.</v>

1060
00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Chemically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what dmt is his dime methyl tryptamine </v>

1061
00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:33.730
<v Speaker 2>what mushrooms are cubensis mushrooms is</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Fox for a boxy and,</v>

1062
00:51:34.281 --> 00:51:37.280
<v Speaker 2>and dimethyltryptamine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're very closely,</v>

1063
00:51:37.281 --> 00:51:39.400
<v Speaker 2>chemically related.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1064
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:43.970
<v Speaker 2>you have this intense feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection with everything,</v>

1065
00:51:43.971 --> 00:51:46.850
<v Speaker 2>with people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the friends in your life,</v>

1066
00:51:46.851 --> 00:51:48.050
<v Speaker 2>with animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1067
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:49.500
<v Speaker 2>with wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

1068
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:54.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why they say do mushrooms and go </v>

1069
00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:54.520
<v Speaker 2>into nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you do,</v>

1070
00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.210
<v Speaker 2>when you have some mushrooms and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>laying in a in a,</v>

1071
00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:58.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the woods,</v>

1072
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a plot of trees you'll,</v>

1073
00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.110
<v Speaker 2>you'll like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel like the energy of the trees.</v>

1074
00:52:03.111 --> 00:52:08.111
<v Speaker 2>It's like some Avatar type shit like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>really feel like the fucking tree of is </v>

1075
00:52:08.111 --> 00:52:11.070
<v Speaker 2>communicating with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that our,</v>

1076
00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:16.120
<v Speaker 2>our main problem as human beings is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are in a stage of evolution and we're</v>

1077
00:52:18.321 --> 00:52:23.321
<v Speaker 2>in an adolescent stage and we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly passing where we used to be </v>

1078
00:52:23.321 --> 00:52:27.851
<v Speaker 2>and our just our potential for evolving </v>
<v Speaker 2>above the basic fight or flight </v>

1079
00:52:27.851 --> 00:52:32.741
<v Speaker 2>instincts and our potential for evolving</v>
<v Speaker 2>above just just animal brutality and </v>

1080
00:52:32.871 --> 00:52:37.871
<v Speaker 2>anger and jealousy and all these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we think that we need in order to </v>

1081
00:52:37.871 --> 00:52:37.871
<v Speaker 2>compete and survive.</v>

1082
00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:42.940
<v Speaker 2>We have potential to rise above that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what yoga is all about and that's</v>

1083
00:52:43.131 --> 00:52:48.131
<v Speaker 2>what meditation is all about in </v>
<v Speaker 2>isolation tanks and people who are a </v>

1084
00:52:48.131 --> 00:52:48.710
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic enthusiasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1085
00:52:48.711 --> 00:52:53.711
<v Speaker 2>that's what that's all about is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this struggle up this slippery slope to </v>

1086
00:52:55.281 --> 00:53:00.281
<v Speaker 2>get to the top to have just a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>better view of what the world could be.</v>

1087
00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:05.360
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the potential that we have inside</v>

1088
00:53:05.361 --> 00:53:07.700
<v Speaker 2>of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all moving towards that,</v>

1089
00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human understanding,</v>

1090
00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.200
<v Speaker 2>human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of human enlightenment,</v>

1091
00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:12.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1092
00:53:12.951 --> 00:53:17.951
<v Speaker 2>this quest to get your shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all moving away from these </v>

1093
00:53:17.951 --> 00:53:22.930
<v Speaker 2>nonsensical animal instincts to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something higher and more evolved and I </v>

1094
00:53:24.051 --> 00:53:28.020
<v Speaker 2>think that potential is the only good </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that human beings have.</v>

1095
00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:31.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like we have this potential for one</v>
<v Speaker 2>side or the other.</v>

1096
00:53:31.831 --> 00:53:33.890
<v Speaker 2>We have this potential to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1097
00:53:33.891 --> 00:53:38.550
<v Speaker 2>like an evil government that corrupts </v>
<v Speaker 2>citizens or we have this potential to be</v>

1098
00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:39.300
<v Speaker 2>a brother.</v>

1099
00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:44.420
<v Speaker 2>We have this potential to be a sister.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to potentially be someone who </v>

1100
00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:45.170
<v Speaker 2>loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they love family life.</v>

1101
00:53:45.171 --> 00:53:46.950
<v Speaker 2>They love themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1102
00:53:46.951 --> 00:53:48.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a buddy that as a kid,</v>

1103
00:53:48.931 --> 00:53:52.620
<v Speaker 2>and we were talking about babies </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently and we were just joking around.</v>

1104
00:53:52.621 --> 00:53:57.621
<v Speaker 2>He's a comic as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gene Pompa last night at the Improv and </v>

1105
00:53:57.621 --> 00:54:02.211
<v Speaker 2>we're just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've had this conversation with </v>

1106
00:54:02.211 --> 00:54:02.280
<v Speaker 2>other people too about how it makes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>like so much nicer person.</v>

1107
00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:03.750
<v Speaker 2>And I said that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1108
00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:08.751
<v Speaker 2>if everybody treated everybody the way I</v>
<v Speaker 2>treat my daughter would have fucking </v>

1109
00:54:08.751 --> 00:54:12.800
<v Speaker 2>beautiful world we would live in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would just be a world of warmth and </v>

1110
00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:13.220
<v Speaker 2>friendship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1111
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:17.850
<v Speaker 2>if we just had a pill that made you love</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody the way I love my daughter and</v>

1112
00:54:17.851 --> 00:54:19.620
<v Speaker 2>we do have a pill like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called ecstasy.</v>

1113
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:21.240
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible for you.</v>

1114
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:23.910
<v Speaker 2>And the next day you feel like shit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it hurts your head.</v>

1115
00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.260
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1116
00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:29.340
<v Speaker 2>if we figured out a way and maybe we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do that,</v>

1117
00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:32.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe that's what the next stage </v>
<v Speaker 2>of evolution really is all about.</v>

1118
00:54:32.431 --> 00:54:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's an evolution pill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1119
00:54:34.531 --> 00:54:35.260
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1120
00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:40.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people will take the evolution </v>

1121
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:41.841
<v Speaker 2>vaccine and some people won't and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll shoot your arm with some shit </v>

1122
00:54:41.841 --> 00:54:45.471
<v Speaker 2>that lasts six months and it's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>vaccination against stupidity.</v>

1123
00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:50.130
<v Speaker 2>Some vaccination against against </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense,</v>

1124
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:54.180
<v Speaker 2>against a lack of understanding and </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciation of the fact that we're here</v>

1125
00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:57.780
<v Speaker 2>in this temporary situation as one </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic hive,</v>

1126
00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:00.480
<v Speaker 2>one super organism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one super organism,</v>

1127
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.520
<v Speaker 2>and that the more love you spread out </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1128
00:55:02.521 --> 00:55:05.370
<v Speaker 2>the more positive energy you spread out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you get back,</v>

1129
00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:08.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more it comes back to affect you and</v>

1130
00:55:08.191 --> 00:55:10.680
<v Speaker 2>it goes out and ripples because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that you affect,</v>

1131
00:55:10.681 --> 00:55:15.681
<v Speaker 2>they affect other people as well and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>more positive you spread out of </v>

1132
00:55:15.681 --> 00:55:16.380
<v Speaker 2>literally you can change your world.</v>

1133
00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:19.440
<v Speaker 2>You can change the world of the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you come in contact with.</v>

1134
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:25.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is what human beings are </v>

1135
00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:25.980
<v Speaker 2>slowly starting to realize and that may </v>
<v Speaker 2>be what God really is,</v>

1136
00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:27.780
<v Speaker 2>what God might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is everything.</v>

1137
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:32.100
<v Speaker 2>What it's not is a bunch of dudes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking robes that want to have sex with</v>

1138
00:55:32.101 --> 00:55:33.300
<v Speaker 2>your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1139
00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:35.550
<v Speaker 2>that's not God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nonsense.</v>

1140
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:40.670
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidential candidates and all these </v>

1141
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:44.810
<v Speaker 2>knuckleheads that want to be world </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaders and they want to guide us </v>

1142
00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:44.810
<v Speaker 2>towards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1143
00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:46.380
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not guiding us towards anything.</v>

1144
00:55:46.381 --> 00:55:51.381
<v Speaker 2>It's business as usual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no evolution whatsoever in the </v>

1145
00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:54.681
<v Speaker 2>political process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no evolution whatsoever amongst </v>

1146
00:55:54.681 --> 00:55:57.591
<v Speaker 2>these fuckheads that talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are decades and decades behind the </v>

1147
00:55:57.591 --> 00:56:00.990
<v Speaker 2>Progressive American culture that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are at the front of the line</v>

1148
00:56:00.991 --> 00:56:03.840
<v Speaker 2>of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these motherfuckers are decades behind.</v>

1149
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea of religious freedom.</v>

1150
00:56:05.881 --> 00:56:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1151
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should have the freedom to study </v>

1152
00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.001
<v Speaker 2>religiously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should have the freedom to do </v>

1153
00:56:14.001 --> 00:56:16.101
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't feed the flying Spaghetti </v>

1154
00:56:16.101 --> 00:56:16.101
<v Speaker 2>Monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your thing.</v>

1155
00:56:16.101 --> 00:56:16.490
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1156
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:21.320
<v Speaker 2>but you can't take it seriously like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1157
00:56:21.321 --> 00:56:24.370
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't expect someone who is.</v>

1158
00:56:24.371 --> 00:56:26.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the whole idea of the separation</v>

1159
00:56:26.471 --> 00:56:31.471
<v Speaker 2>of church and state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole idea is like some sort of a </v>

1160
00:56:31.471 --> 00:56:33.190
<v Speaker 2>concede conceding somehow that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1161
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:35.410
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to believe really </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous shit.</v>

1162
00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:38.190
<v Speaker 2>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about we just leave all the religion</v>

1163
00:56:38.191 --> 00:56:41.560
<v Speaker 2>now and all we concentrate on is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>things are run business,</v>

1164
00:56:41.561 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 2>how we treat each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what laws we enforce,</v>

1165
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:46.240
<v Speaker 2>how you make sure that people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>being victimized.</v>

1166
00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:50.820
<v Speaker 2>These fucking politicians and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>newspapers and all these people that,</v>

1167
00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.170
<v Speaker 2>that really follow all this pope </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

1168
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:56.320
<v Speaker 2>They just add credence to it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>knuckleheads read about in the news.</v>

1169
00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:01.380
<v Speaker 2>So they think it's legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a conversation with someone where </v>

1170
00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:01.380
<v Speaker 2>they were saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1171
00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:01.380
<v Speaker 2>that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1172
00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.460
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about cults and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1173
00:57:03.461 --> 00:57:05.580
<v Speaker 2>I was watching a documentary and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really fascinating.</v>

1174
00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Was a documentary on Christianity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they kept referring it to the cult of </v>

1175
00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:15.301
<v Speaker 2>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they're referring it to in </v>

1176
00:57:15.301 --> 00:57:15.301
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1177
00:57:15.301 --> 00:57:16.120
<v Speaker 2>the very scientific documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this woman was very upset.</v>

1178
00:57:16.121 --> 00:57:17.500
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity is not called.</v>

1179
00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:18.730
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1180
00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.650
<v Speaker 2>How can you say it's not cool?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

1181
00:57:20.651 --> 00:57:21.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because first of all,</v>

1182
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:24.130
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a cult that has billions </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people in it.</v>

1183
00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Yes you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's just a bigger call.</v>

1184
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Like if you ever caught that as three </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1185
00:57:30.521 --> 00:57:33.160
<v Speaker 2>if you can trick three people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can trick 3 million.</v>

1186
00:57:33.161 --> 00:57:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can find three people dumb enough</v>

1187
00:57:35.501 --> 00:57:37.960
<v Speaker 2>to believe your wackiness and they let </v>
<v Speaker 2>you fuck them.</v>

1188
00:57:37.961 --> 00:57:41.080
<v Speaker 2>And they were purple Nike's because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell them that's the sacred color.</v>

1189
00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:44.710
<v Speaker 2>If you get three people to do that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they really believe it,</v>

1190
00:57:44.711 --> 00:57:46.090
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get more people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it.</v>

1191
00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.750
<v Speaker 2>We are all going through this life </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely clueless.</v>

1192
00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:54.780
<v Speaker 2>These we are like people in a spaceship </v>
<v Speaker 2>that woke up from hyper sleep and we're </v>

1193
00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:58.630
<v Speaker 2>going through the manuals and no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows how to run the ship.</v>

1194
00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:03.690
<v Speaker 2>That's what we are alike and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few of us that are older that are </v>

1195
00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:04.420
<v Speaker 2>pretending to the younger people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

1196
00:58:04.421 --> 00:58:05.680
<v Speaker 2>don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got this.</v>

1197
00:58:05.681 --> 00:58:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Everything's going to be fine.</v>

1198
00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:09.790
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have a meeting with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress to work on this house and these</v>

1199
00:58:09.791 --> 00:58:14.791
<v Speaker 2>people are trying to placate the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 2>us who are just like them and no one </v>

1200
00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:20.040
<v Speaker 2>knows what the fuck is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anybody that steps up and tells you </v>

1201
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:24.331
<v Speaker 2>that they have all the answers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that God wants this for you and God </v>

1202
00:58:24.331 --> 00:58:24.331
<v Speaker 2>wants that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1203
00:58:24.331 --> 00:58:25.600
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the enemy.</v>

1204
00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Anybody that says they have the answers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're your enemy.</v>

1205
00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:31.990
<v Speaker 2>And anybody who wants your money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're your enemy to you.</v>

1206
00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:33.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me a fucking show.</v>

1207
00:58:33.971 --> 00:58:38.971
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't just stand there and recite some </v>

1208
00:58:38.971 --> 00:58:41.371
<v Speaker 2>stupid Latin Shit and pass around a </v>
<v Speaker 2>basket because you're too lazy to work </v>

1209
00:58:41.371 --> 00:58:41.830
<v Speaker 2>for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Fuck No.</v>

1210
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:44.080
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be the real messenger,</v>

1211
00:58:44.081 --> 00:58:46.090
<v Speaker 2>the word of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be asking for money.</v>

1212
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop it.</v>

1213
00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.940
<v Speaker 2>People would be giving my new because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they love you.</v>

1214
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:54.030
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't have a fucking basket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pass around and make everybody feel </v>

1215
00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:54.030
<v Speaker 2>guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

1216
00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:55.360
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nonsense.</v>

1217
00:58:55.361 --> 00:58:57.130
<v Speaker 2>That's silly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goddamn nonsense.</v>

1218
00:58:57.131 --> 00:59:02.131
<v Speaker 2>And until we acknowledge that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until we acknowledge that that is our </v>

1219
00:59:02.131 --> 00:59:03.760
<v Speaker 2>own insecurities that are asking us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>search for an answer to something that's</v>

1220
00:59:03.761 --> 00:59:06.190
<v Speaker 2>impossible to answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to acknowledge that we're fucked,</v>

1221
00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:08.410
<v Speaker 2>we're just spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our wheels were in the same spot.</v>

1222
00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:09.640
<v Speaker 2>We've always been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1223
00:59:09.641 --> 00:59:14.641
<v Speaker 2>and that that is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is everybody wants to </v>

1224
00:59:14.641 --> 00:59:16.090
<v Speaker 2>pretend that there's an answer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you cannot answer.</v>

1225
00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.700
<v Speaker 2>There is no answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is absolutely impossible.</v>

1226
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:21.440
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there is a god,</v>

1227
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:26.800
<v Speaker 2>it's probably so much more complex than </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could ever possibly wrap your </v>

1228
00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.070
<v Speaker 2>fucking head around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you what,</v>

1229
00:59:28.071 --> 00:59:29.390
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1230
00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:30.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam and eve,</v>

1231
00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:31.340
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1232
00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:34.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not God made to people and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1233
00:59:34.101 --> 00:59:39.101
<v Speaker 2>they fucked and they had kids and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids started fucking each other because </v>

1234
00:59:39.101 --> 00:59:39.230
<v Speaker 2>that's what Adam and eve is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only two people.</v>

1235
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:44.470
<v Speaker 2>He just one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like any child with a simple </v>

1236
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:46.700
<v Speaker 2>grasp of mathematics and five minutes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it,</v>

1237
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:47.510
<v Speaker 2>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1238

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you the story of Adam </v>
<v Speaker 2>and eve.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1240
00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:52.550

<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1241
00:59:52.551 --> 00:59:55.250
<v Speaker 2>if Adam and eve made people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody came from Adam and eve,</v>

1242
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.640
<v Speaker 2>everybody the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1243
00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:00.080
<v Speaker 2>If Adam and eve made people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had kids and the kids were like,</v>

1244
01:00:00.081 --> 01:00:03.410
<v Speaker 2>they were brothers and sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did they make more people?</v>

1245
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:06.800
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1246
01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:09.350
<v Speaker 2>they fucked each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fucked each other.</v>

1247
01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:14.630
<v Speaker 2>The Adam fuck the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he fucked the kids and the kids </v>

1248
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:15.200
<v Speaker 2>fucked each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where people came from.</v>

1249
01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:19.260
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 2010.</v>

1250
01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:26.560
<v Speaker 2>No one has any fucking answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one got damaged except maybe </v>

1251
01:00:28.161 --> 01:00:33.161
<v Speaker 2>Gangstarr gangstarr has got the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's my long answer to a short </v>

1252
01:00:47.961 --> 01:00:49.760
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck the pope.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I'll be doing it next Tuesday,</v>

1282
01:02:13.951 --> 01:02:14.860
<v Speaker 1>the 23rd.</v>

<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bobby says,</v>

1285
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I once read,</v>

1286
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:30.000
<v Speaker 2>if they legalized all drugs it could </v>
<v Speaker 2>cost the USA 150,000</v>

1287
01:02:30.001 --> 01:02:33.120
<v Speaker 2>good jobs and cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lawyers and so forth.</v>

1288
01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:38.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I believed the war on drugs is a </v>

1289
01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.241
<v Speaker 2>makeup make work project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget about if they're getting some </v>

1290
01:02:41.241 --> 01:02:41.880
<v Speaker 2>profits and selling them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's true,</v>

1291
01:02:41.881 --> 01:02:42.520
<v Speaker 2>but it sounded right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1292
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:47.570
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The war on drugs is definitely look the </v>

1293
01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:52.250
<v Speaker 2>between the private prisons and between </v>
<v Speaker 2>a law enforcement.</v>

1294
01:02:52.531 --> 01:02:57.531
<v Speaker 2>There's an industry and keeping drugs </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal and it's not about protecting </v>

1295
01:02:57.531 --> 01:02:58.770
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know some drugs.</v>

1296
01:02:58.771 --> 01:02:59.430
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1297
01:02:59.431 --> 01:03:01.650
<v Speaker 2>You know when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they go and close down crystal meth</v>

1298
01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:02.820
<v Speaker 2>labs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1299
01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:05.970
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking danger because crystal </v>
<v Speaker 2>meth makes people.</v>

1300
01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:08.940
<v Speaker 2>It completely fucks with their judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes them insane.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He fucked that bitch with a tattoo on </v>

1302

<v Speaker 2>her head.</v>

<v Speaker 2>when he fucked her.</v>

1304
01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:19.220
<v Speaker 2>There's no way he was sober.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't fuck chicks with tattoos on </v>

1305
01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:22.731
<v Speaker 2>their head when you're sober.</v>

<v Speaker 2>sinners tattooed on her fucking </v>

01:03:33.391 --> 01:03:34.530
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible drug,</v>

<v Speaker 2>is another one.</v>

1314
01:03:36.241 --> 01:03:41.241
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen cocaine turn people into </v>

1315
01:03:41.241 --> 01:03:41.241
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they become like,</v>

1316
01:03:41.241 --> 01:03:42.450
<v Speaker 2>like roaches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They become like bugs,</v>

1317
01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:45.570
<v Speaker 2>you know that like they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't thinking about human and just</v>

1318
01:03:45.571 --> 01:03:47.580
<v Speaker 2>trying to get that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like get that shit.</v>

1319
01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.160
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They literally get black sharp guys.</v>

1320
01:03:50.161 --> 01:03:51.900
<v Speaker 2>They turn dead on the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

1321
01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:55.830
<v Speaker 2>There's drugs that are terrible for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and those drugs.</v>

1322
01:03:55.830 --> 01:04:00.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see an argument for them being </v>

1323
01:04:00.830 --> 01:04:02.841
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see an argument for us doing </v>

1324
01:04:02.841 --> 01:04:03.440
<v Speaker 2>something about the people that sell </v>
<v Speaker 2>them because they're,</v>

1325
01:04:03.441 --> 01:04:05.670
<v Speaker 2>they're damaging people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dangerous,</v>

1326
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:09.540
<v Speaker 2>but there's other drugs like mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 2>and pot.</v>

1327
01:04:09.690 --> 01:04:11.100
<v Speaker 2>If you get caught with those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1328
01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:13.560
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are still illegal drugs.</v>

1329
01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:16.110
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more illegal than heroin.</v>

1330
01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Schedule One drugs for the most part are</v>

1331
01:04:19.231 --> 01:04:23.760
<v Speaker 2>the drugs that really have like use </v>
<v Speaker 2>schedule one is the most illegal.</v>

1332
01:04:23.761 --> 01:04:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Schedule One is DMT,</v>

1333
01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.520
<v Speaker 2>which your own brain produces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as Terence Mckenna,</v>

1334
01:04:29.521 --> 01:04:30.720
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1335
01:04:30.721 --> 01:04:31.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's holding.</v>

1336
01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:33.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really,</v>

1337
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:35.420
<v Speaker 2>really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are in production,</v>

1338
01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:40.640
<v Speaker 2>in production and in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are in possession of a really </v>

1339
01:04:40.951 --> 01:04:44.610
<v Speaker 2>illegal substance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The number one to schedule one,</v>

1340
01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.610
<v Speaker 2>dmt a marijuana schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One.</v>

1341
01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.050
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever died.</v>

1342
01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Pot ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what?</v>

1343
01:04:50.711 --> 01:04:52.790
<v Speaker 2>It can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only way pot is going to kill you is</v>

1344
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.590
<v Speaker 2>if you're standing on the wrong side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fence.</v>

1345
01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:58.870
<v Speaker 2>When one of those Mexican drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>helicopters comes over and pushes a bail</v>

1346
01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:02.260
<v Speaker 2>out at clubs you on the fucking head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you die for pot.</v>

1347
01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to die for pot.</v>

1348
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.690
<v Speaker 2>You might think you're dying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're just gonna fall asleep.</v>

1349
01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.850
<v Speaker 2>And you're going to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's fucking died of it ever,</v>

1350
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.880
<v Speaker 2>but yet still pot is scheduled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One mushrooms,</v>

1351
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:16.910
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of anybody dying for </v>

1352
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.910
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can definitely dive.</v>

1353
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:20.331
<v Speaker 2>You eat poison mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but poison buffered by the way are </v>

1354
01:05:20.331 --> 01:05:22.801
<v Speaker 2>illegal and you could have poisoned </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms all around your backyard and </v>

1355
01:05:22.801 --> 01:05:23.800
<v Speaker 2>you can munch on them all day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking die of a heart attack and nobody</v>

1356
01:05:23.801 --> 01:05:24.370
<v Speaker 2>gives a shit.</v>

1357
01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:27.270
<v Speaker 2>No one's going to have a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to be a big inquest.</v>

1358
01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:29.260
<v Speaker 2>No one's going to go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you,</v>

1359
01:05:29.261 --> 01:05:34.261
<v Speaker 2>if you put psilocybin mushrooms in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>yard and the cops come and find them </v>

1360
01:05:34.261 --> 01:05:36.790
<v Speaker 2>growing in your yard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will lock you in a fucking cage.</v>

1361
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Even though psilocybin mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can make you go crazy if you do too</v>

1362
01:05:40.211 --> 01:05:45.211
<v Speaker 2>many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you have a weak mental </v>

1363
01:05:45.211 --> 01:05:47.431
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see you going crazy for </v>

1364
01:05:47.431 --> 01:05:47.431
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just too much information,</v>

1365
01:05:47.431 --> 01:05:50.650
<v Speaker 2>too much realization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you could go crazy from anything.</v>

1366
01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:53.010
<v Speaker 2>You can go crazy from paint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you could,</v>

1367
01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:54.710
<v Speaker 2>you could have pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1368
01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.840
<v Speaker 2>sniff pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blow your fucking brains out.</v>

1369
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:58.990
<v Speaker 2>You can go crazy for anything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot,</v>

1370
01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:01.410
<v Speaker 2>some people are weak and fragile and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's uh,</v>

1371
01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:04.030
<v Speaker 2>any really extreme experience can fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>them up.</v>

1372
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:05.850
<v Speaker 2>There's an ant that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1373
01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:07.950
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called an iron and I forget</v>
<v Speaker 2>the name of the amt,</v>

1374
01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:12.960
<v Speaker 2>but this ant bites you and the venom is </v>
<v Speaker 2>so intense and horrify that it's been </v>

1375
01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:18.841
<v Speaker 2>described as slamming your arm into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>car door for an hour.</v>

1376
01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:23.410
<v Speaker 2>That's what it feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just slamming your arm.</v>

1377
01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Imagine what that would feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it lasts for 24 hours.</v>

1378
01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.400
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this intense,</v>

1379
01:06:30.401 --> 01:06:31.450
<v Speaker 2>insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throbbing.</v>

1380
01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Like literally you're getting ripped </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart,</v>

1381
01:06:33.551 --> 01:06:38.551
<v Speaker 2>like someone slamming a door on your arm</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it lasts a whole day and the </v>

1382
01:06:38.551 --> 01:06:42.040
<v Speaker 2>experience is so traumatic that some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people when they come out of it,</v>

1383
01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:47.041
<v Speaker 2>they are never the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just a shell there just so </v>

1384
01:06:47.041 --> 01:06:50.371
<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could not get through the pain of </v>

1385
01:06:50.371 --> 01:06:53.551
<v Speaker 2>one full 24 hour period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The like there's some shit in the world </v>

1386
01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:54.220
<v Speaker 2>that could fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1387
01:06:54.221 --> 01:06:58.450
<v Speaker 2>That's not why marijuana is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what mushrooms are illegal.</v>

1388
01:06:58.670 --> 01:07:01.840
<v Speaker 2>They're illegal because they're trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep you from them.</v>

1389
01:07:01.841 --> 01:07:06.841
<v Speaker 2>They don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want a society that is </v>

1390
01:07:06.841 --> 01:07:08.140
<v Speaker 2>questioning leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want a society.</v>

1391
01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:10.540
<v Speaker 2>And that's the other problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people that are in power,</v>

1392
01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:14.080
<v Speaker 2>they're not using these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout human history.</v>

1393
01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:19.290
<v Speaker 2>Shamans have been the leaders of tribes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Shamans have been the ones that the </v>

1394
01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:23.320
<v Speaker 2>tribe will go to when the tribe has </v>
<v Speaker 2>troubles and what the Shamans are,</v>

1395
01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:28.440
<v Speaker 2>where people who had a lot of experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>and navigating psychedelic dimensions </v>

1396
01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.600
<v Speaker 2>and in the Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you know,</v>

1397
01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:35.200
<v Speaker 2>they would all sit around and drink </v>
<v Speaker 2>IOWASCA.</v>

1398
01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:37.060
<v Speaker 2>Iowasca is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1399
01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:40.180
<v Speaker 2>an herb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a like a tea that they brew with that,</v>

1400
01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:42.880
<v Speaker 2>that produces dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's uh,</v>

1401
01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:43.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1402
01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:48.420
<v Speaker 2>ordinarily DMT is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't drink it because it gets </v>

1403
01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:49.930
<v Speaker 2>broken down when you take it in orally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you eat it,</v>

1404
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:55.270
<v Speaker 2>it gets broken down by something in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>stomach called monell aiming oxidase and</v>

1405
01:07:55.271 --> 01:08:00.271
<v Speaker 2>it's produced in your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this Iowasca was a way that they </v>

1406
01:08:00.271 --> 01:08:05.191
<v Speaker 2>figured out how to extract DMT and Amano</v>
<v Speaker 2>aiming oxidase inhibitor from another </v>

1407
01:08:06.731 --> 01:08:08.260
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really fucking crazy.</v>

1408
01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:09.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been doing this for 10,000</v>

1409
01:08:09.941 --> 01:08:14.941
<v Speaker 2>years and a place where there's 250,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus different species of plants.</v>

1410
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:20.200
<v Speaker 2>They figured out a way to combine two to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make this incredible brew that lets you </v>

1411
01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:24.671
<v Speaker 2>communicate with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the afterlife and which by the way </v>

1412
01:08:24.671 --> 01:08:25.310
<v Speaker 2>is totally illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1413
01:08:25.311 --> 01:08:28.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a mess.</v>

1414
01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1415
01:08:29.610 --> 01:08:31.880
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a real fucking mess.</v>

1416
01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:34.430
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you start think about what would it</v>

1417
01:08:34.431 --> 01:08:39.431
<v Speaker 2>really is because what it really is is </v>
<v Speaker 2>people keeping other people from having </v>

1418
01:08:39.431 --> 01:08:42.890
<v Speaker 2>an experience and the reasoning for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why is not because they think</v>

1419
01:08:42.891 --> 01:08:47.891
<v Speaker 2>that this person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they have that experience going to </v>

1420
01:08:47.891 --> 01:08:47.891
<v Speaker 2>make life difficult for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to come after me.</v>

1421
01:08:47.891 --> 01:08:49.310
<v Speaker 2>They're going to hurt my family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1422
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:54.430
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it because they can profit</v>
<v Speaker 2>off this person not having that </v>

1423
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:55.850
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I say that something is illegal and I</v>

1424
01:08:55.851 --> 01:09:00.851
<v Speaker 2>set forth laws and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you cross this boundary and you do </v>

1425
01:09:00.851 --> 01:09:00.920
<v Speaker 2>this behavior and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1426
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:04.220
<v Speaker 2>you violate my law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to lock you in a cage.</v>

1427
01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:07.850
<v Speaker 2>I get to make money from locking you in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally that I get to employ people</v>

1428
01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:11.840
<v Speaker 2>that will now they have a job and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>job is to go after people that are doing</v>

1429
01:09:11.841 --> 01:09:16.841
<v Speaker 2>what I said they couldn't do and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and kidnap them and put them in a </v>

1430
01:09:16.841 --> 01:09:18.500
<v Speaker 2>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're having with marijuana</v>

1431
01:09:18.501 --> 01:09:20.700
<v Speaker 2>and mushroom bust and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>

1432
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:23.990
<v Speaker 2>You're telling someone that you buy your</v>
<v Speaker 2>judgment,</v>

1433
01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.690
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't have that experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you say,</v>

1434
01:09:26.691 --> 01:09:31.691
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to make such an extreme </v>

1435
01:09:31.691 --> 01:09:31.691
<v Speaker 2>judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that judgment has to be based on facts,</v>

1436
01:09:31.691 --> 01:09:31.691
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1437
01:09:31.691 --> 01:09:32.720
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be based on facts.</v>

1438
01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:37.750
<v Speaker 2>Of course it doesn't because of it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>then marijuana would have been legal in </v>

1439
01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:41.741
<v Speaker 2>the 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would've been legal in the </v>

1440
01:09:41.741 --> 01:09:44.320
<v Speaker 2>when when they passed the sweeping </v>
<v Speaker 2>schedule One psychedelics act of 1970,</v>

1441
01:09:44.751 --> 01:09:45.290
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was.</v>

1442
01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:47.540
<v Speaker 2>When they made everything illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have.</v>

1443
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.140
<v Speaker 2>They would have had to provide some </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasoning for making mushrooms illegal.</v>

1444
01:09:51.141 --> 01:09:56.141
<v Speaker 2>Some reasoning for making marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal and it would've been scientific </v>

1445
01:09:56.141 --> 01:09:59.471
<v Speaker 2>and it would have been medical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is every single fucking </v>

1446
01:09:59.471 --> 01:10:01.781
<v Speaker 2>medical study that's ever been done </v>
<v Speaker 2>about marijuana shows that it's </v>

1447
01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:01.781
<v Speaker 2>relatively harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1448
01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:06.341
<v Speaker 2>you can ruin your life with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can ruin your life with </v>

1449
01:10:06.341 --> 01:10:08.110
<v Speaker 2>cheeseburgers if you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was talking about like bottles,</v>

1450
01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:13.130
<v Speaker 2>you could take a bottle and bottles can </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold a nice delicious drink or you can </v>

1451
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:16.311
<v Speaker 2>take a bottle and you can stuff it up </v>
<v Speaker 2>your ass and throw yourself down a </v>

1452
01:10:16.311 --> 01:10:19.031
<v Speaker 2>flight of stairs and bleed to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that bottle should be </v>

1453
01:10:19.031 --> 01:10:21.491
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real fucking problem is that we are </v>

1454
01:10:21.491 --> 01:10:24.761
<v Speaker 2>allowing people to victimize other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people for profit and that's what the </v>

1455
01:10:24.761 --> 01:10:29.051
<v Speaker 2>war on drugs is all about and the reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the war on drugs works at all is </v>

1456
01:10:29.051 --> 01:10:31.100
<v Speaker 2>because the people responsible to cops </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the lawyers,</v>

1457
01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:32.090
<v Speaker 2>they're not doing drugs.</v>

1458
01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.340
<v Speaker 2>If they were doing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they were doing the right drugs,</v>

1459
01:10:34.341 --> 01:10:36.110
<v Speaker 2>they are doing mushrooms and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking pot.</v>

1460
01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:38.090
<v Speaker 2>There would be nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would all stop.</v>

1461
01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.790
<v Speaker 2>They would have to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do the correct amount of mushroom</v>

1462
01:10:40.791 --> 01:10:45.791
<v Speaker 2>dose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would realize that in victimizing </v>

1463
01:10:45.791 --> 01:10:45.791
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are victimizing yourself.</v>

1464
01:10:45.791 --> 01:10:47.660
<v Speaker 2>You are creating a terrible stream of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Karma.</v>

1465
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:50.180
<v Speaker 2>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are ruining lives for nothing.</v>

1466
01:10:50.210 --> 01:10:55.210
<v Speaker 2>You were ruining lives for something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't have anything to do with </v>

1467
01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:58.031
<v Speaker 2>you and something that's been around in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of for marijuana and mushrooms and</v>

1468
01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:01.670
<v Speaker 2>Iowasca tens of thousands of years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human use.</v>

1469
01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:03.740
<v Speaker 2>And as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in those indigenous cultures,</v>

1470
01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:06.380
<v Speaker 2>the Shaman was the one who made the </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions.</v>

1471
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:09.230
<v Speaker 2>That's because this is the guy that had </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most experience and these,</v>

1472
01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.530
<v Speaker 2>these matters of the spirit world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have that anymore.</v>

1473
01:11:12.531 --> 01:11:17.531
<v Speaker 2>Now we have opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have leaders that if we find out </v>

1474
01:11:17.531 --> 01:11:17.760
<v Speaker 2>they're doing mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be shocked.</v>

1475
01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.920
<v Speaker 2>We would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would want them removed from office.</v>

1476
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:22.800
<v Speaker 2>If Obama had a press conference on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Monday and said,</v>

1477
01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.250
<v Speaker 2>I got together with my wife the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

1478
01:11:26.251 --> 01:11:28.280
<v Speaker 2>We did five grams of mushrooms and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1479
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:31.290
<v Speaker 2>we went to the mountains and I really </v>
<v Speaker 2>started thinking about our country.</v>

1480
01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Everybody be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

1481
01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:38.670
<v Speaker 2>That would be the most beautiful thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he could ever say if he could say,</v>

1482
01:11:38.671 --> 01:11:43.671
<v Speaker 2>I just took something that allowed me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally tune into the stream of love.</v>

1483
01:11:45.331 --> 01:11:48.150
<v Speaker 2>That is God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the energy of the universe,</v>

1484
01:11:48.151 --> 01:11:53.151
<v Speaker 2>that is mother Gaia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I connected myself to all of that is </v>

1485
01:11:53.151 --> 01:11:55.920
<v Speaker 2>loving in the world and I came back with</v>
<v Speaker 2>some revelations and some thoughts about</v>

1486
01:11:55.921 --> 01:12:00.921
<v Speaker 2>how we can lead our culture better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we can be kinder to the rest of the </v>

1487
01:12:00.921 --> 01:12:01.260
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how instead of going all these places to</v>

1488
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:04.470
<v Speaker 2>to control the resources and to to to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ruin them.</v>

1489
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:07.110
<v Speaker 2>How about we introduce them to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual realm?</v>

1490
01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:09.420
<v Speaker 2>How about we introduced the whole world </v>
<v Speaker 2>to mushrooms.</v>

1491
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:14.510
<v Speaker 2>How about we approved them in mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>quantities and slowly start to open </v>

1492
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:18.201
<v Speaker 2>people's eyes up to the fact that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a lack of resources that we have in </v>

1493
01:12:18.201 --> 01:12:20.640
<v Speaker 2>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a gluttonous fucking gigantic group</v>

1494
01:12:20.641 --> 01:12:23.400
<v Speaker 2>at the top that are fucking in raping </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1495
01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:28.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not that we have not enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>resource to run the life that we we </v>

1496
01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:28.820
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

1497
01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:31.920
<v Speaker 2>We don't have enough resources to run </v>
<v Speaker 2>the life we're living.</v>

1498
01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:34.500
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to live like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all nonsense.</v>

1499
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:37.380
<v Speaker 2>We wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we live a non agriculturally based life.</v>

1500
01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:40.830
<v Speaker 2>We live a life where we rely on fossil </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuels and you know,</v>

1501
01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:43.650
<v Speaker 2>we rely on petroleum or we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1502
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:46.320
<v Speaker 2>There's many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many things that can be done with plants</v>

1503
01:12:46.321 --> 01:12:47.520
<v Speaker 2>that we're doing right now.</v>

1504
01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:49.620
<v Speaker 2>If marijuana was legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1505
01:12:49.621 --> 01:12:54.621
<v Speaker 2>just hemp as for use for oil and use for</v>
<v Speaker 2>textiles and use for,</v>

1506
01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:57.320
<v Speaker 2>for you can make houses out of it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

1507
01:12:57.350 --> 01:13:00.820
<v Speaker 2>you can fucking fuel cars with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could build cars with it.</v>

1508
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:03.450
<v Speaker 2>Load is actually made a fucking car with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a um,</v>

1509
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:05.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of carbon fiber or fiberglass,</v>

1510
01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:07.890
<v Speaker 2>they made the fucking shallow out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hemp.</v>

1511
01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:10.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all possible.</v>

1512
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:15.950
<v Speaker 2>We just can't live the way we're living </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now and there's no way to </v>

1513
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:19.440
<v Speaker 2>effectively reset civilization better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than psychedelics.</v>

1514
01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:24.090
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile saying that makes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound like a retard.</v>

1515
01:13:24.091 --> 01:13:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm listening to my own self and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1516
01:13:25.531 --> 01:13:30.531
<v Speaker 2>if I didn't do drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had never done mushrooms or </v>

1517
01:13:30.531 --> 01:13:30.531
<v Speaker 2>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard a guy talking like this.</v>

1518
01:13:30.531 --> 01:13:31.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is this idiot?</v>

1519
01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.820
<v Speaker 2>Like what could you pop?</v>

1520
01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:36.030
<v Speaker 2>How could you possibly say that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think you have all the answers?</v>

1521
01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:41.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the answers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do have a possible door to the </v>

1522
01:13:41.341 --> 01:13:46.341
<v Speaker 2>answers and that's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think psychedelic experiences are and </v>

1523
01:13:46.381 --> 01:13:47.880
<v Speaker 2>these guys that are running for </v>
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>

1524
01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:49.800
<v Speaker 2>they will deny that to the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will.</v>

1525
01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:50.910
<v Speaker 2>They will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1526
01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:56.570
<v Speaker 2>Obama had this fucking thing recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas a town hall meeting and he got </v>

1527
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:58.980
<v Speaker 2>all these questions from the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the number one question,</v>

1528
01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:04.400
<v Speaker 2>the number one question was marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>legalization and every other issue that </v>

1529
01:14:04.471 --> 01:14:09.471
<v Speaker 2>was being discussed that day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it was healthcare or anything </v>

1530
01:14:09.471 --> 01:14:09.630
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gave these really well thought out in</v>

1531
01:14:09.631 --> 01:14:11.870
<v Speaker 2>depth answers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it came to the marijuana question.</v>

1532
01:14:11.871 --> 01:14:12.520
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1533
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:13.400
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1534
01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:14.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that says about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>group here.</v>

1535
01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:16.240
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1536
01:14:16.241 --> 01:14:18.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1537
01:14:18.810 --> 01:14:21.310
<v Speaker 2>You don't think that's a good idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think it's a good idea to stop</v>

1538
01:14:21.311 --> 01:14:26.311
<v Speaker 2>suppressing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think it's a good idea to not </v>

1539
01:14:26.311 --> 01:14:27.040
<v Speaker 2>jail people for having a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

1540
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.500
<v Speaker 2>to not jail people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for selling a plant,</v>

1541
01:14:29.501 --> 01:14:32.020
<v Speaker 2>a naturally growing thing that's never </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed anyone.</v>

1542
01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:37.200
<v Speaker 2>You don't think that it's a good idea to</v>
<v Speaker 2>reverse and evil fuck up corrupt law </v>

1543
01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:43.060
<v Speaker 2>that is helping people with the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>Karma ever imprison people for nothing.</v>

1544
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need some fucking mushrooms and </v>

1545
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:51.631
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a whole group of people running </v>

1546
01:14:51.631 --> 01:14:52.840
<v Speaker 2>this fucking country and none of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>are doing mushrooms.</v>

1547
01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:57.190
<v Speaker 2>I would like to have a talk show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

1548
01:14:57.590 --> 01:15:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about this on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to have a talk show where I make </v>

1549
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:03.840
<v Speaker 2>people do mushrooms with me and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would.</v>

1550
01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:07.660
<v Speaker 2>It would be called a do mushrooms with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan and we have on,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1553
01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.840
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once that fucking wave hits you,</v>

1554
01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:22.020
<v Speaker 2>that wave of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of alien information and the wave of </v>

1555
01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:26.971
<v Speaker 2>love and connectivity and when you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fiber of the universe all around </v>

1556
01:15:26.971 --> 01:15:27.580
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to start talking.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And if I could get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1558
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:35.410
<v Speaker 2>like Ken Starr and Dick Cheney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and could you imagine,</v>

1559
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:40.390
<v Speaker 2>could you imagine if those guys like if </v>
<v Speaker 2>people sued them and people,</v>

1560
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1561
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:41.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like,</v>

1562
01:15:41.981 --> 01:15:46.981
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that want to </v>

1563
01:15:46.981 --> 01:15:46.981
<v Speaker 2>take them to trial for war crimes.</v>

1564
01:15:46.981 --> 01:15:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Especially Dick Cheney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think about the fact that Dick </v>

1565
01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Cheney was the ceo of Halliburton and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then he becomes a vice president of the </v>

1566
01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.640
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go to some crazy fucking wars,</v>

1567
01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:59.730
<v Speaker 2>or Halliburton gets the contracts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wars are all based on totally false </v>

1568
01:15:59.730 --> 01:16:01.090
<v Speaker 2>information about weapons of mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction.</v>

1569
01:16:01.091 --> 01:16:03.310
<v Speaker 2>There's people that say that Dick Cheney</v>
<v Speaker 2>was at the helm of it.</v>

1570
01:16:03.311 --> 01:16:05.530
<v Speaker 2>He was lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could try that motherfucker for wars</v>

1571
01:16:05.531 --> 01:16:07.270
<v Speaker 2>against your current crimes against </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity.</v>

1572
01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:10.840
<v Speaker 2>You could try him for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if he was convicted and they said,</v>

1573
01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.300
<v Speaker 2>here's one thing you can do to get out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotTa do the let's get,</v>

<v Speaker 2>any really fucked up politician George </v>

1578
01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:29.020
<v Speaker 2>Bush,</v>

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:30.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone like that.</v>

1580
01:16:30.611 --> 01:16:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Sit them down and make them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do mushrooms.</v>

1581
01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Make them realize that just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been living this life the same </v>

1582
01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:42.151
<v Speaker 2>way as everyone before you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as your father and all these other </v>

1583
01:16:42.151 --> 01:16:46.321
<v Speaker 2>corrupt politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean as justifiable just </v>

1584
01:16:46.321 --> 01:16:46.810
<v Speaker 2>because you could find examples all </v>
<v Speaker 2>around you.</v>

1585
01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:49.420
<v Speaker 2>People who have done worse and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were doing the same things.</v>

1586
01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:52.960
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that it's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue and it's got to this gotta be a</v>

1587
01:16:52.961 --> 01:16:56.290
<v Speaker 2>way to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to be stopping with the,</v>

1588
01:16:56.291 --> 01:16:58.960
<v Speaker 2>the evolution of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be the same.</v>

1589
01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:01.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be the corruption.</v>

1590
01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:06.440
<v Speaker 2>It's being exposed more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't seem like it's put a </v>

1591
01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:06.760
<v Speaker 2>monkey wrench in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're just stopping,</v>

1592
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:07.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1593
01:17:07.471 --> 01:17:10.400
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the financial corruption in this bailout</v>

1594
01:17:10.401 --> 01:17:15.401
<v Speaker 2>is staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you really want to hurt your </v>

1595
01:17:15.401 --> 01:17:15.401
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go and read some of them.</v>

1596
01:17:15.401 --> 01:17:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>

1597
01:17:15.501 --> 01:17:18.860
<v Speaker 2>tie ebs articles about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It fucking hurts,</v>

1598
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:23.950
<v Speaker 2>like when you look at the billions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trillions of dollars and where it's </v>

1599
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:27.371
<v Speaker 2>going and how it's being funded and </v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are getting bonuses and </v>

1600
01:17:27.371 --> 01:17:31.661
<v Speaker 2>they're getting bonuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have any money from the </v>

1601
01:17:31.661 --> 01:17:31.661
<v Speaker 2>money came from tax payers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were old.</v>

1602
01:17:31.661 --> 01:17:32.860
<v Speaker 2>The bonuses or else they'll quit or </v>
<v Speaker 2>wild.</v>

1603
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:35.150
<v Speaker 2>They fire them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones that fuck this thing up</v>

1604
01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:37.370
<v Speaker 2>and at first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's staggering.</v>

1605
01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:42.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's literally our entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization is built on a foundation of</v>

1606
01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.760
<v Speaker 2>unfixable bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the only way I think to restructure</v>

1607
01:17:52.341 --> 01:17:57.341
<v Speaker 2>our society correctly with literally it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have to be done by someone other </v>

1608
01:17:57.341 --> 01:18:02.081
<v Speaker 2>than us because once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what the constitution was </v>

1609
01:18:02.081 --> 01:18:03.080
<v Speaker 2>all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When there was the birth of America,</v>

1610
01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:07.520
<v Speaker 2>the idea of America was that we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have a separation of church and</v>

1611
01:18:07.521 --> 01:18:12.521
<v Speaker 2>state that we were going to have people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that could only run it for a few years </v>

1612
01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:16.151
<v Speaker 2>and then they would have to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were going to have the will of the </v>

1613
01:18:16.151 --> 01:18:19.361
<v Speaker 2>people and then it was going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be free from all the </v>

1614
01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:20.570
<v Speaker 2>imperialism bullshit that we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with in England and in Europe,</v>

1615
01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:23.750
<v Speaker 2>but after awhile it just fell into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

1616
01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:26.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people inherently,</v>

1617
01:18:26.690 --> 01:18:29.750
<v Speaker 2>if we're left alone and we're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>people the way we are right now,</v>

1618
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:35.050
<v Speaker 2>our evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our cultural and social evolution is so </v>

1619
01:18:35.050 --> 01:18:36.380
<v Speaker 2>much lower than the evolution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

1620
01:18:36.381 --> 01:18:41.381
<v Speaker 2>What we're able to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were able to communicate with people </v>

1621
01:18:41.381 --> 01:18:44.111
<v Speaker 2>all around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're flying fucking tubes through the </v>

1622
01:18:44.111 --> 01:18:47.141
<v Speaker 2>sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're able to send video through the </v>

1623
01:18:47.141 --> 01:18:47.141
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1624
01:18:47.141 --> 01:18:50.870
<v Speaker 2>we're able to watch television programs </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are being broadcast from the other </v>

1625
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:54.521
<v Speaker 2>side of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have this incredible </v>

1626
01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:57.311
<v Speaker 2>technological capabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but socially we're just a bump ahead of </v>

1627
01:18:57.311 --> 01:18:58.640
<v Speaker 2>where we were in the fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a little,</v>

1628
01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:00.800
<v Speaker 2>just a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1629
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:05.830
<v Speaker 2>it could be argued that were like </v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly behind where we were in the </v>

1630
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:06.210
<v Speaker 2>seventies in comparison to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1631
01:19:06.211 --> 01:19:11.211
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as far as like what kind of access </v>

1632
01:19:11.211 --> 01:19:11.840
<v Speaker 2>to information they had back then.</v>

1633
01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:16.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was all about love and peace </v>

1634
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.950
<v Speaker 2>and love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1635
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that?</v>

1636
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Why was the sixties the late sixties?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1637
01:19:17.991 --> 01:19:22.991
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the drop off between then in </v>

1638
01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:22.991
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1639
01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:25.220
<v Speaker 2>strokes to what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you know all that summer of love,</v>

1640
01:19:25.221 --> 01:19:27.350
<v Speaker 2>all that woodstock ship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were all on acid.</v>

1641
01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:28.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all in mushrooms.</v>

1642
01:19:28.491 --> 01:19:30.320
<v Speaker 2>They're all in pod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were highest fuck.</v>

1643
01:19:30.321 --> 01:19:34.870
<v Speaker 2>And they were realizing that this way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>living the life that you know,</v>

1644
01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.140
<v Speaker 2>leads you to be your dad is not where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's at when you want.</v>

1645
01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:44.141
<v Speaker 2>Your Dad dropped out of a fucking heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack at 55 and you scarcely can </v>

1646
01:19:44.141 --> 01:19:45.800
<v Speaker 2>remember him laughing three times ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1647
01:19:45.801 --> 01:19:46.400
<v Speaker 2>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1648
01:19:46.401 --> 01:19:48.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm supposed to be that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that?</v>

1649
01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:54.100
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the Vietnam War and all the </v>

1650
01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:56.510
<v Speaker 2>disenchantment with our government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what forced people to more</v>

1651
01:19:56.511 --> 01:19:56.900
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

1652
01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:59.090
<v Speaker 2>That's what forced the culture to change</v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

1653
01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:05.200
<v Speaker 2>We need something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need something like that right now </v>

1654
01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:05.990
<v Speaker 2>because the way we're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just spinning our wheels.</v>

1655
01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:10.620
<v Speaker 2>When the president wins the Nobel Peace </v>
<v Speaker 2>Prize and then like a week later,</v>

1656
01:20:10.621 --> 01:20:14.100
<v Speaker 2>since 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people more into Afghanistan,</v>

1657
01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:16.080
<v Speaker 2>you've got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1658
01:20:16.170 --> 01:20:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what the fuck you think this is</v>

1659
01:20:18.691 --> 01:20:20.700
<v Speaker 2>a good idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>

1660
01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:24.450
<v Speaker 2>After the Vietnam War,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Vietnam war was a good idea.</v>

1661
01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Less people are going to think the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan war is a good idea because </v>

1662
01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan isn't even really the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking country.</v>

1663
01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:36.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like it's like one city and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred tribes.</v>

1664
01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:41.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way John Mccain describes </v>

1665
01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.071
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said that it's run the same way it </v>

1666
01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:43.071
<v Speaker 2>was run when Alexander the Great was </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

1667
01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean literally you have war and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they run tribes and in between these </v>

1668
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.550
<v Speaker 2>warlords,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1669
01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:50.550
<v Speaker 2>there's a few Taliban like sprinkled in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hills and you know,</v>

1670
01:20:50.551 --> 01:20:52.920
<v Speaker 2>how we find out about these Taliban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where it gets really funny.</v>

1671
01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:58.100
<v Speaker 2>We give the warlords Viagara because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>warlords can get it up anymore and you </v>

1672
01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:00.180
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to still be the warlord,</v>

1673
01:21:00.210 --> 01:21:05.210
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got like there's six wives and </v>

1674
01:21:05.210 --> 01:21:05.210
<v Speaker 2>these chicks are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit around.</v>

<v Speaker 2>can't fuck up.</v>

1676
01:21:06.810 --> 01:21:11.810
<v Speaker 2>So they take Viagra now and the soldiers</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them Viagra and they in turn in </v>

1677
01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:13.590
<v Speaker 2>turn give them information about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Taliban.</v>

1678
01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:14.760
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>people that are</v>

1681
01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.140
<v Speaker 1>dying of starvation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Sam Kennison and the best answer</v>

1682

1705
01:22:45.821 --> 01:22:48.310
<v Speaker 1>So Freddie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the top one could be the same guy.</v>

1706
01:22:48.311 --> 01:22:50.140
<v Speaker 1>In which case I say Bolter Ron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy.</v>

1707
01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:55.070
<v Speaker 1>My right side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sad that I know twitter.</v>

1708
01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:56.830
<v Speaker 1>She was on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

1709
01:22:56.860 --> 01:23:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I love you too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rs for Andrew.</v>

1710
01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:05.280
<v Speaker 1>You motherfucker infiltrate the White </v>
<v Speaker 1>House kitchen and mix psychedelics in </v>

1711
01:23:08.891 --> 01:23:11.560
<v Speaker 1>the food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might not be such a good idea.</v>

1712
01:23:11.561 --> 01:23:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>France?</v>

1713
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I'll find the article for you in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>CIA.</v>

1714
01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:24.420
<v Speaker 1>The CIA put a LSD in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They spiked.</v>

1715
01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:29.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll put the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1716
01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:33.020
<v Speaker 1>it's all over the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not just one.</v>

1717
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:35.670
<v Speaker 1>I'll put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1718
01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:37.610
<v Speaker 1>I'll put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put one up on,</v>

1719
01:23:37.611 --> 01:23:41.390
<v Speaker 1>but if you just look up CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

1720
01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:46.100
<v Speaker 1>lsd in Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will find a many,</v>

1721
01:23:46.101 --> 01:23:48.110
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many articles about it.</v>

1722
01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:49.700
<v Speaker 1>I'll put it up on twitter right now.</v>

1723
01:24:10.630 --> 01:24:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Just throw it up on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1724
01:24:12.671 --> 01:24:17.230
<v Speaker 1>There is some fascinating shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that dosing people with</v>

1725
01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:20.590
<v Speaker 1>a acid is the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1726
01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely not the way to go.</v>

1727
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think any psychedelic drugs should be </v>

1728
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:30.991
<v Speaker 1>done if you've got to do it at all with </v>
<v Speaker 1>an understanding of what you're doing </v>

1729
01:24:30.991 --> 01:24:31.930
<v Speaker 1>and you're doing it with someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what they're doing,</v>

1730
01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:36.960
<v Speaker 1>who's done it many times before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the role of a shaman is </v>

1731
01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:36.960
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1732
01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.400
<v Speaker 1>what a shaman is supposed to be is </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who can give you a experience </v>

1733
01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:44.200
<v Speaker 1>and help you and guide you through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of,</v>

1734
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:49.390
<v Speaker 1>of literally leaving this world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1735
01:24:49.391 --> 01:24:51.280
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what psychedelics are all about.</v>

1736
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:52.510
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants,</v>

1737
01:24:52.511 --> 01:24:54.190
<v Speaker 1>everybody thinks that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1738
01:24:54.191 --> 01:24:59.191
<v Speaker 1>to really leave this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get a spaceship and </v>

1739
01:24:59.191 --> 01:24:59.191
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go to another planet.</v>

1740
01:24:59.191 --> 01:25:00.610
<v Speaker 1>You can leave this world from right </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1741
01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:05.820
<v Speaker 1>You can leave this world in your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and it's much more possible to me </v>

1742
01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:09.460
<v Speaker 1>that the real aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that real alien life,</v>

1743
01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:14.730
<v Speaker 1>it's probably way weirder and way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated than we've got it broken </v>

1744
01:25:14.730 --> 01:25:16.450
<v Speaker 1>down in the movies with metal ships and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit like that.</v>

1745
01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more of a dimensional </v>

1746
01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:22.480
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>

1747
01:25:22.530 --> 01:25:23.390
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1748
01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:28.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you talk to people that know </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about quantum physics and I </v>

1749
01:25:28.410 --> 01:25:28.410
<v Speaker 1>don't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it,</v>

1750
01:25:28.410 --> 01:25:31.660
<v Speaker 1>but from their claims and supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is mathematically provable,</v>

1751
01:25:31.661 --> 01:25:34.170
<v Speaker 1>there's at least 11 dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1752
01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:36.670
<v Speaker 1>that's just what we know about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that even mean?</v>

1753
01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you even know what that means?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I do,</v>

1754
01:25:39.330 --> 01:25:44.330
<v Speaker 1>but I think that the way I think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that it's,</v>

1755
01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:49.680
<v Speaker 1>it's very likely that just this reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>is just the reality that we're tuned </v>

1756
01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:53.701
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's probably an infinite number </v>

1757
01:25:53.701 --> 01:25:55.990
<v Speaker 1>of different realities going on at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time all around us.</v>

1758
01:25:56.140 --> 01:26:01.140
<v Speaker 1>We just can't tune into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just don't literally don't have the </v>

1759
01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:04.081
<v Speaker 1>senses for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it might be the alien life is here </v>

1760
01:26:04.081 --> 01:26:08.140
<v Speaker 1>right now all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just operating on like a different </v>

1761
01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:08.540
<v Speaker 1>frequency on the dial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1762
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:11.930
<v Speaker 1>like the world is a radio and that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>97 point one,</v>

1763
01:26:11.931 --> 01:26:14.250
<v Speaker 1>but that the aliens are one of nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>point eight and you know,</v>

1764
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:16.520
<v Speaker 1>we just can't do an event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1765
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:19.130
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1766
01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:23.110
<v Speaker 1>when you start talking to aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people going to think you're crazy.</v>

1767
01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:29.230
<v Speaker 1>If we ever did we ever did fucking find </v>
<v Speaker 1>is God damn.</v>

1768
01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Would that be a crazy day if they ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>did come down?</v>

1769
01:26:32.691 --> 01:26:37.691
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think there would be too </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice to us because we're not so nice to </v>

1770
01:26:37.691 --> 01:26:37.691
<v Speaker 1>chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1771
01:26:37.691 --> 01:26:38.450
<v Speaker 1>look at what we do to killer whales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1772
01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:43.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we take fucking killer whales when we </v>

1773
01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:43.780
<v Speaker 1>know they're super smart and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

1774
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:49.510
<v Speaker 1>We don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the fish texted with getting the </v>

1775
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:50.570
<v Speaker 1>tank do tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1776
01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:53.810
<v Speaker 1>what makes us think that aliens are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to treat us any differently.</v>

1777
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that maybe that's what all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>alien abduction experience are all </v>

1778
01:26:59.050 --> 01:26:59.140
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're real.</v>

1779
01:26:59.150 --> 01:27:02.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't take it seriously at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just think we're crazy pink monkeys</v>

1780
01:27:02.001 --> 01:27:05.570
<v Speaker 1>with nuclear weapons and they come down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they fuck with us and there's a joke</v>

1781
01:27:05.571 --> 01:27:08.630
<v Speaker 1>that I do in my act about how if there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are really are aliens,</v>

1782
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:12.700
<v Speaker 1>I believe the earth is the Tiawana of </v>
<v Speaker 1>outer space and I really,</v>

1783
01:27:12.701 --> 01:27:13.910
<v Speaker 1>I think that might be accurate.</v>

1784
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:18.910
<v Speaker 1>I might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this might be just a place to come to </v>

1785
01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:18.910
<v Speaker 1>fuck around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1786
01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.790
<v Speaker 1>why would you want to fix us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why,</v>

1787
01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:23.930
<v Speaker 1>so we can make more is already 6 billion</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us.</v>

1788
01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:25.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1789
01:27:25.610 --> 01:27:28.070
<v Speaker 1>why would you want to make more and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1790
01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:30.280
<v Speaker 1>the last hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1791
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:35.290
<v Speaker 1>how many more people have been born </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like four or five fucking </v>

1792
01:27:35.290 --> 01:27:35.410
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's Ken,</v>

1793
01:27:35.411 --> 01:27:40.411
<v Speaker 1>pretty naughty man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is motherfuckers gonna get </v>

1794
01:27:40.411 --> 01:27:41.420
<v Speaker 1>overcrowded soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why?</v>

1795
01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Why would they mean if you've got to fix</v>
<v Speaker 1>us?</v>

1796
01:27:43.281 --> 01:27:48.281
<v Speaker 1>It would have to be a radical changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have to be really radical </v>

1797
01:27:48.281 --> 01:27:51.940
<v Speaker 1>because socially we're not catching up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to where we are technologically.</v>

1798
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Our awareness is not up to what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of,</v>

1799
01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:58.730
<v Speaker 1>what we're capable of blowing up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole plan for in.</v>

1800
01:27:58.750 --> 01:28:03.110
<v Speaker 1>We're capable of creating black holes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're capable of all kinds of shit.</v>

1801
01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean just the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nuclear arsenal that North Korea </v>

1802
01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:08.140
<v Speaker 1>possesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those dummies.</v>

1803
01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:10.790
<v Speaker 1>They got one fucking stupid little dude </v>
<v Speaker 1>with glasses.</v>

1804
01:28:11.010 --> 01:28:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Makes them shut the lights out at night </v>
<v Speaker 1>to save energy.</v>

1805
01:28:13.011 --> 01:28:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's got any money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This motherfucker's got to Ghana nuclear</v>

1806
01:28:15.321 --> 01:28:20.321
<v Speaker 1>weapons just quarter to launch on people</v>
<v Speaker 1>11.</v>

1807
01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this guy.</v>

1808
01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:27.740
<v Speaker 1>11 dimensions explained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says as Y Z ge,</v>

1809
01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:28.720
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1810
01:28:28.730 --> 01:28:32.240
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one a watch that and I still won't learn</v>

1811
01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:33.680
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch it,</v>

1812
01:28:33.681 --> 01:28:36.460
<v Speaker 1>but I'll still be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure really what their science.</v>

1813
01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:47.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couple more questions here and I hear my</v>

1814
01:28:48.630 --> 01:28:49.260
<v Speaker 3>daughter's crying.</v>

1815
01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:59.910
<v Speaker 1>If aliens didn't exist that says that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone who was abducted or saw a Ufo </v>

1816
01:28:59.910 --> 01:29:00.280
<v Speaker 1>is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1817
01:29:00.281 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because first of all,</v>

1818
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:04.710
<v Speaker 2>what you have found means unidentified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something,</v>

1819
01:29:04.711 --> 01:29:06.450
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are full of Shit.</v>

1820
01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:09.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did a thing.</v>

1821
01:29:09.271 --> 01:29:11.550
<v Speaker 2>I used to do a show called game show in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my head.</v>

1822
01:29:11.551 --> 01:29:16.551
<v Speaker 2>I did it for CBS and it was a hidden </v>
<v Speaker 2>camera game show and what the show was </v>

1823
01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:17.730
<v Speaker 2>was we would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1824
01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:18.700
<v Speaker 2>we would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1825
01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:23.720
<v Speaker 2>have a contestant and the contestant </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have to convince people to do a </v>

1826
01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:24.270
<v Speaker 2>bunch of shit and it would be under a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hidden camera.</v>

1827
01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:27.420
<v Speaker 2>And we set up in Hollywood and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1828
01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:29.940
<v Speaker 2>we had a contestant dress up like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>newscaster,</v>

1829
01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:34.970
<v Speaker 2>like a guy worked for channel four news </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he stood there on the street corner </v>

1830
01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:37.560
<v Speaker 2>and we had all these cameras pointed on </v>
<v Speaker 2>him when the cameras right on the people</v>

1831
01:29:37.710 --> 01:29:40.560
<v Speaker 2>and he would go up to people and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you do me a favor?</v>

1832
01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:45.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a terrible situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a situation here earlier and uh,</v>

1833
01:29:46.570 --> 01:29:51.570
<v Speaker 2>a Ufo landed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to tell the people on camera </v>

1834
01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:54.980
<v Speaker 2>that a Ufo landed and that all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>witnesses had seen it.</v>

1835
01:29:55.140 --> 01:30:00.140
<v Speaker 2>But then the witnesses took off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I need you to pretend that you </v>

1836
01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:03.580
<v Speaker 2>sought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every fucking person we asked to do </v>

1837
01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:04.860
<v Speaker 2>that did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought no one was going to do it.</v>

1838
01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:07.560
<v Speaker 2>They just stepped right up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so tell us about the experience.</v>

1839
01:30:07.630 --> 01:30:08.340
<v Speaker 2>And the guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1840
01:30:08.341 --> 01:30:13.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw the UFO and it was silver lights </v>

1841
01:30:13.341 --> 01:30:13.341
<v Speaker 2>were on the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They describe it in detail.</v>

1842
01:30:13.341 --> 01:30:18.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting there like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why people love to be on camera and </v>

1843
01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:22.671
<v Speaker 2>people are just generally full shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even if they did see something by </v>

1844
01:30:22.671 --> 01:30:25.110
<v Speaker 2>the time that story comes around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's cameras on them or they're being</v>

1845
01:30:25.111 --> 01:30:26.850
<v Speaker 2>interviewed and they're talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reporters,</v>

1846
01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:28.830
<v Speaker 2>that story is going to morph in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>memory.</v>

1847
01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:31.140
<v Speaker 2>It's going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what the fuck it was.</v>

1848
01:30:31.290 --> 01:30:33.480
<v Speaker 2>It could have been an experimental </v>
<v Speaker 2>government jet.</v>

1849
01:30:33.630 --> 01:30:35.520
<v Speaker 2>It could have been a flock of birds at </v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

1850
01:30:35.521 --> 01:30:40.521
<v Speaker 2>It could have been a Ufo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows who knows what it </v>

1851
01:30:40.521 --> 01:30:44.121
<v Speaker 2>really was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the people that are talking about </v>

1852
01:30:44.121 --> 01:30:45.090
<v Speaker 2>are almost all nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1853
01:30:45.210 --> 01:30:50.210
<v Speaker 2>They're almost all looney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that people see things and </v>

1854
01:30:50.210 --> 01:30:51.270
<v Speaker 2>then they blow those things up in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

1855
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:56.390
<v Speaker 2>And as far as the abduction experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all Ufo duction experiences occur while </v>

1856
01:30:56.390 --> 01:31:01.311
<v Speaker 2>people are sleeping there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're all a curling like late at </v>

1857
01:31:01.311 --> 01:31:01.311
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at them,</v>

1858
01:31:01.311 --> 01:31:05.211
<v Speaker 2>the bulk of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except that people are just completely </v>

1859
01:31:05.211 --> 01:31:06.500
<v Speaker 2>insane to think they come and take them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1860
01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:11.600
<v Speaker 2>during the middle of the day and bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>them back and it seems like there were </v>

1861
01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:11.600
<v Speaker 2>only gone for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really they're gone for days.</v>

1862
01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:14.550
<v Speaker 2>There's some loons that will tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>some stories like that,</v>

1863
01:31:14.551 --> 01:31:19.551
<v Speaker 2>but I think that what's going on is it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>dmt related because we know that the </v>

1864
01:31:20.161 --> 01:31:25.161
<v Speaker 2>brain produces dmt while a person is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy rem sleep and if you smoked dmt,</v>

1865
01:31:26.850 --> 01:31:30.450
<v Speaker 2>the experience that you have is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>much alien.</v>

1866
01:31:30.690 --> 01:31:35.690
<v Speaker 2>It's very much like what you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>expect someone to be talking about if </v>

1867
01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:36.510
<v Speaker 2>they were brought to another world or </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought a border spaceship.</v>

1868
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels like you're going on to </v>

1869
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:42.470
<v Speaker 2>something you know and who knows what </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a,</v>

1870
01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:47.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a response you would give these Ufo </v>

1871
01:31:47.530 --> 01:31:50.481
<v Speaker 2>people if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you took them and gave them dmt and </v>

1872
01:31:50.481 --> 01:31:50.481
<v Speaker 2>made them smoke dmt and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1873
01:31:50.481 --> 01:31:52.290
<v Speaker 2>was that what you saw?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they're like,</v>

1874
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:53.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was back on the ship and go,</v>

1875
01:31:53.810 --> 01:31:55.110
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>settle down.</v>

1876
01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:57.090
<v Speaker 2>Then you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you know what's going on,</v>

1877
01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:58.260
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

1878
01:31:58.290 --> 01:32:00.400
<v Speaker 2>Are they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they really making contact</v>

1879
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.790
<v Speaker 1>with entities?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it really their brain and their,</v>

1880
01:32:03.791 --> 01:32:08.791
<v Speaker 1>their imagination that becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>supercharged because of this chemical </v>

1881
01:32:08.791 --> 01:32:09.580
<v Speaker 1>that floods through it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is imagination exactly?</v>

1882
01:32:09.581 --> 01:32:10.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1883
01:32:10.691 --> 01:32:12.370
<v Speaker 1>people can poo poo that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1884
01:32:12.371 --> 01:32:13.510
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making things up.</v>

1885
01:32:13.511 --> 01:32:16.280
<v Speaker 1>It's hallucinations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1886
01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:21.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that that world is not </v>

1887
01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:21.480
<v Speaker 1>just as real as this world just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this world,</v>

1888
01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:23.440
<v Speaker 1>you can bang on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make noise.</v>

1889
01:32:23.441 --> 01:32:24.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could feel it.</v>

1890
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:28.900
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean it's more real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just means it's solid.</v>

1891
01:32:29.190 --> 01:32:29.700
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1892
01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:32.140
<v Speaker 1>it's very possible that the world of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination,</v>

1893
01:32:32.141 --> 01:32:36.400
<v Speaker 1>the world of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of dreams is really a world is</v>

1894
01:32:36.401 --> 01:32:37.690
<v Speaker 1>really another dimension.</v>

1895
01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Do I believe in ghosts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not scared of him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fucking ghosts never killed anybody.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how many of those goddamn </v>

<v Speaker 1>bigfoot.</v>

1904

<v Speaker 1>These super intelligent animals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked to actually rescue people that </v>

1905
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:16.610
<v Speaker 1>kill or they killed great white sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed dolphins.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think Dan Hardy's exciting dude talks </v>

1930
01:34:20.230 --> 01:34:23.160
<v Speaker 1>a lot of shitty saying all the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>things because he had serious power in </v>

1931
01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:26.341
<v Speaker 1>his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just whether or not he's going to </v>

1932
01:34:26.341 --> 01:34:26.341
<v Speaker 1>be able to deal with that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling game of GSP.</v>

1933
01:34:26.341 --> 01:34:27.940
<v Speaker 1>GSP can take you down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1934
01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:31.370
<v Speaker 1>He's such an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Managed so explosive and it's,</v>

1935
01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just really hard for dudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to avoid that take down and he gets on </v>

1936
01:34:36.450 --> 01:34:36.880
<v Speaker 1>top of you and stays on top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It got to beat your ass.</v>

1937
01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:42.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is about GSP is will it be a </v>

1938
01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:44.200
<v Speaker 1>fight like the Tiago Alvarez fight where</v>
<v Speaker 1>he neutralized elvis but he never really</v>

1939
01:34:44.201 --> 01:34:49.201
<v Speaker 1>came close to stopping them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or will it be a fight like the Fitch </v>

1940
01:34:49.201 --> 01:34:52.300
<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bj fight where he just gets on top </v>

1941
01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:52.300
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat the fucking shit out of them,</v>

1942
01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:53.440
<v Speaker 1>or will hardy have something up his </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeve,</v>

1943
01:34:53.470 --> 01:34:58.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a hardee's takedown defense is </v>

1944
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.470
<v Speaker 1>better than we thought it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1945
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.470
<v Speaker 1>maybe hardy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1946
01:34:58.730 --> 01:35:03.730
<v Speaker 1>has a strategy for how to counter the </v>
<v Speaker 1>double and how to stop him when he's </v>

1947
01:35:03.730 --> 01:35:04.460
<v Speaker 1>coming in or how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1948
01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:06.470
<v Speaker 1>take it to him or maybe he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull guard.</v>

1949
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:11.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck knows what hard he's </v>

1950
01:35:11.470 --> 01:35:11.470
<v Speaker 1>going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1951
01:35:11.470 --> 01:35:13.800
<v Speaker 1>he's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart guy and he's very confident </v>

1952
01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:13.800
<v Speaker 1>and it's real confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not bullshit.</v>

1953
01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:17.120
<v Speaker 1>He really believes that he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>clip GSP and he's going to rock them and</v>

1954
01:35:17.121 --> 01:35:20.620
<v Speaker 1>he's going to go home with the title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows sun?</v>

1955
01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:25.940
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spice bag of ice.</v>

1956
01:35:25.941 --> 01:35:30.941
<v Speaker 1>I'll spilled bag of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says that the 11th dimension is in his </v>

1957
01:35:30.941 --> 01:35:30.941
<v Speaker 1>pants.</v>

<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1959
01:35:33.201 --> 01:35:35.120

<v Speaker 1>twitter by now.</v>

1960
01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:38.480
<v Speaker 1>You've got a lot of sticktuitiveness on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1962
01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:41.750

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1963
01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:45.470
<v Speaker 1>So I can 37 slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfect time to end.</v>

1964
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:49.340
<v Speaker 1>We are proof that aliens exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perspective.</v>
