00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:35.341
<v Speaker 1>England.</v>

18
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>They are going to be going off whenever law in that cage.</v>

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:41.821
<v Speaker 1>over there.</v>

23
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:42.654
<v Speaker 1>He's never lost.</v>

24
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Well Dude,</v>

25
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>there's some serious love for Bisping in Manchester.</v>

26
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>When I went to Bisbing,</v>

27
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.211
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:48.500
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

29
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>to Manchester to watch him fight,</v>

30
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking it was a match.</v>

31
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>I've seen him fight a couple of times in England,</v>

32
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

33
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.211
<v Speaker 1>But when you,</v>

34
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>when you see him over there,</v>

35
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>you realize,</v>

36
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.921
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

37
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 1>they just don't like them.</v>

38
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>And certain parts of America that in,</v>

39
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>in England,</v>

40
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>he's gigantic superstar.</v>

41
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>He's the reason why I'm in May so big UHG over there.</v>

42
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't realize it because it's been a bunch of times,</v>

43
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

44
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:14.781
<v Speaker 1>the fans turned against him and some some events and here for talking shit when</v>

45
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>he said the f Word Fag.</v>

46
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>But in England it's different.</v>

47
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:19.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not the homosexual term.</v>

48
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like a cigarette.</v>

49
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

50
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.893
<v Speaker 1>So when he uses it,</v>

51
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.381
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

52
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>He didn't mean it in that tone.</v>

53
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.821
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

54
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:25.250
<v Speaker 1>But that's how he was saying it.</v>

55
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't saying it like it was a cigarette.</v>

56
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:27.910
<v Speaker 1>He was saying that but,</v>

57
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

58
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>but over there it's a little different.</v>

59
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:30.961
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

60
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Like they throw it around in a different connotation.</v>

61
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>This is what you always understand when it comes to trash talking,</v>

62
00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:38.280
<v Speaker 1>when two dudes or trash talking each other,</v>

63
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>you cannot expect them to keep it PC.</v>

64
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.671
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

65
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>What they're trying to do is humiliate each other,</v>

66
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>his verbal warfare.</v>

67
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>And you can't say that that's his position on gay.</v>

68
00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>People know if he's,</v>

69
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it's rude for him to say it.</v>

70
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's rude for him to insinuate there's anything wrong with being</v>

71
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 1>homosexual.</v>

72
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Definitely he's fucking with that guy.</v>

73
00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>You got to understand this is not like a deposition in court.</v>

74
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>This is not like his ultimate feelings on homicide.</v>

75
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump shit is concentrated fat cause he wants to punch him in the face he</v>

76
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.610
<v Speaker 1>wants.</v>

77
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully it doesn't run for presidency.</v>

79
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

80
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about that Trump thing where over here</v>

81
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.701
<v Speaker 1>it's like that movie,</v>

82
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.140
<v Speaker 1>the campaign with Will Ferrell.</v>

83
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.180
<v Speaker 1>You can't make this shit up.</v>

84
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is it?</v>

85
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>A joke to say,</v>

86
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.531
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

87
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>you better watch what you say or murdered by Hillary.</v>

88
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.731
<v Speaker 1>That crazy.</v>

89
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a joke and everyone knows it's got to watch what you say.</v>

90
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Hillary will kill Ya and that chick is running for president and that's a joke.</v>

91
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that meme?</v>

92
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>There's a meme of a deer laying on the side of the road is dead and it said,</v>

93
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>what did that deer know about Hillary Clinton</v>

94
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.243
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

95
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.241
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's laughing.</v>

96
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:49.074
<v Speaker 1>I said</v>

97
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>the only reason we would laugh is because it's true.</v>

98
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the only reason we would laugh.</v>

99
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

100
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be funny if you did that about Oprah?</v>

101
00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>That's a point.</v>

102

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

106
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 2>there's that kid who according to Wiki leaks,</v>

107
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.540

108
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:15.430

116
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 2>like deliberately trying to get Bernie Sanders out of the picture.</v>

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 2>Suicided bro?</v>

148
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 2>Suicide in means you pretend that somebody killed,</v>

149
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.573
<v Speaker 2>she killed herself.</v>

150
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

151
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.990
<v Speaker 2>but they make it really,</v>

152
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 2>really obvious that it wasn't a suicide.</v>

153
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:44.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like leaving a statement.</v>

154
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys remember the guy who was the whistle blower for Enron who shot</v>

155
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:48.510
<v Speaker 2>himself in the head twice?</v>

156
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.881
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

157
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Do they do that on purpose?</v>

158
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:51.101
<v Speaker 2>Twice.</v>

159
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:51.934
<v Speaker 2>Twice.</v>

160
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 2>He shot himself in the head twice and they said it was a suicide.</v>

161
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 2>We don't see anything wrong with us.</v>

162
00:04:57.101 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Everything seems normal.</v>

163
00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:59.450
<v Speaker 2>That's a general,</v>

164
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 2>that's a real story.</v>

165
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Politics and you get suicided.</v>

166
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.730
<v Speaker 2>If you look into it,</v>

167
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.250
<v Speaker 2>it's probably going to be pretty obvious.</v>

168
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a,</v>

169
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe I could see wiener commence.</v>

170
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.120
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

171
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.470

173
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.993
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Wiener.</v>

174
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Just can't not send a Jake brake dude's a freak.</v>

175
00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:22.060

176
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:22.894
<v Speaker 2>I'm not mad at it.</v>

177
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Don't have your kid in the bed though.</v>

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Let's bring it to the beginning.</v>

200
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy.</v>

201
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Jamie is a message to Donald Trump and put it in our here so we can hear this.</v>

202
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.533
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

203
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.520
<v Speaker 1>can you do it?</v>

204
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Is it all right or no?</v>

205
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.850
<v Speaker 3>So blatantly stupid.</v>

206
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:17.920
<v Speaker 3>He's a punk.</v>

207
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:19.540
<v Speaker 3>He's a dog.</v>

208
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.970
<v Speaker 3>He's a pig a month.</v>

209
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.590
<v Speaker 3>Who doesn't know what he's talking about?</v>

210
00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:24.640
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't do his homework.</v>

211
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:25.420
<v Speaker 3>He's an idiot.</v>

212
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.950
<v Speaker 3>Colin Powell said it best.</v>

213
00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:27.221
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

214
00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:28.360
<v Speaker 3>national disaster.</v>

215
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.310
<v Speaker 3>He's an embarrassment to this country.</v>

216
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.700
<v Speaker 3>It makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point,</v>

217
00:06:33.701 --> 00:06:34.690
<v Speaker 3>that this fool,</v>

218
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.650
<v Speaker 3>this Bozel as wound up where he has to edit the talks,</v>

219
00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:40.780
<v Speaker 3>how he wants to punch people in the face.</v>

220
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:42.603
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

221
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.170
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to punch him in the face.</v>

222
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.840
<v Speaker 3>This is somebody that we want for president.</v>

223
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.853
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

224
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.510
<v Speaker 3>What I care about is the direction of this country and when I'm very,</v>

225
00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:57.511
<v Speaker 3>very worried about is that it might go in the wrong direction with someone like</v>

226
00:06:57.911 --> 00:06:58.960
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump.</v>

227
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.760
<v Speaker 3>If you care about your future,</v>

228
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.310
<v Speaker 3>vote for it teases</v>

229
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.681
<v Speaker 1>for Hillary.</v>

230
00:07:04.681 --> 00:07:05.430
<v Speaker 1>He's an idiot.</v>

231
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

232
00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:06.451
<v Speaker 1>before he didn't say,</v>

233
00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:07.284
<v Speaker 1>he didn't say.</v>

234
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Now he's saying,</v>

235
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean we got a crazy choice here.</v>

236
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Donald motherfucking Trump and Hillary.</v>

237
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

238
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.640
<v Speaker 1>We know Hillary's crooked is fuck the libertarian candidate.</v>

239
00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:21.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a real option.</v>

240
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>And he's reached as high as I think 20% some states when people are scrambling,</v>

241
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.600
<v Speaker 1>this is the best time ever for a libertarian candidates.</v>

242
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 1>That's an independent and the end it was.</v>

243
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.720
<v Speaker 1>What was that meaning?</v>

244
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.051
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

245
00:07:34.051 --> 00:07:35.520
<v Speaker 1>independent is libertarian.</v>

246
00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Green party candidate is a bunch of different people.</v>

247
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Jill Stein,</v>

248
00:07:38.881 --> 00:07:39.571
<v Speaker 1>she's the,</v>

249
00:07:39.571 --> 00:07:39.871
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

250
00:07:39.871 --> 00:07:40.710
<v Speaker 1>the nominees.</v>

251
00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:40.831
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

252
00:07:40.831 --> 00:07:41.810
<v Speaker 1>no one even hears about her.</v>

253
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.930
<v Speaker 1>She's a Green party candidate,</v>

254
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.360
<v Speaker 1>but she said some ridiculous shit that drives me crazy.</v>

255
00:07:45.361 --> 00:07:47.190
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I think she means,</v>

256
00:07:47.191 --> 00:07:48.720
<v Speaker 1>well and a lot of a lot of areas,</v>

257
00:07:48.721 --> 00:07:49.680
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things she said,</v>

258
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.960
<v Speaker 1>she thinks that 16 year old should be allowed to vote.</v>

259
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.681
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

260
00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:56.160
<v Speaker 1>are you out of your fucking mind bitch at 33?</v>

261
00:07:56.161 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't be able to vote.</v>

262
00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know shit about it.</v>

263
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to vote though.</v>

264
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:02.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

265
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:02.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

266
00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:06.790
<v Speaker 1>for sure there should be a reason why we value your opinion and in,</v>

267
00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:07.161
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

268
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:09.690
<v Speaker 1>the thing about voting as beautiful is that everybody gets a vote.</v>

269
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.230
<v Speaker 1>But the weird thing about voting is that there's a lot of us out there that</v>

270
00:08:13.231 --> 00:08:15.210
<v Speaker 1>really shouldn't have a fucking opinion.</v>

271
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.580
<v Speaker 1>They just haven't researched it.</v>

272
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.050
<v Speaker 1>It's based on nonsense.</v>

273
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.520
<v Speaker 1>They just pick one side.</v>

274
00:08:20.521 --> 00:08:23.100
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the better guy in the movie and that's what they go with.</v>

275
00:08:23.101 --> 00:08:24.090
<v Speaker 1>That's why Trump is,</v>

276
00:08:24.091 --> 00:08:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I think is pulled ahead a little bit.</v>

277
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.311
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

278
00:08:26.311 --> 00:08:27.061
<v Speaker 1>Or doing well,</v>

279
00:08:27.061 --> 00:08:27.751
<v Speaker 1>not pull them ahead,</v>

280
00:08:27.751 --> 00:08:31.320
<v Speaker 1>but doing well because 18 to 36 social media,</v>

281
00:08:31.321 --> 00:08:33.990
<v Speaker 1>you see all the headlines,</v>

282
00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:34.381
<v Speaker 1>headlines,</v>

283
00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:36.240
<v Speaker 1>headlines is the Kim Kardashian effect.</v>

284
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.110
<v Speaker 1>There's all the Kim Kardashian of presidents and there's also a time and that</v>

285
00:08:40.111 --> 00:08:42.120
<v Speaker 1>time is probably coming up very soon.</v>

286
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.520
<v Speaker 1>We're poles are no longer accurate.</v>

287
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.440
<v Speaker 1>There's because no one's taking them.</v>

288
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not taking them.</v>

289
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.090
<v Speaker 1>You're not taking them.</v>

290
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.200
<v Speaker 1>No one ever taking a poll.</v>

291
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Never still pull the people that they're getting in there talking to him.</v>

292
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I have a whole bit about it,</v>

293
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.430
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

294
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.230
<v Speaker 1>it's like those are,</v>

295
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 1>that's the real 1%.</v>

296
00:08:56.131 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 1>We should be concerned with the 1% where answer polls for sure.</v>

297
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Just let me text in my vote.</v>

298
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:00.661
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

299
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

300
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.093
<v Speaker 1>How about my couch?</v>

301
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.103
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

302
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 1>We have like Instagram polls,</v>

303
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:05.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

304
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:06.300
<v Speaker 1>and you can't progress.</v>

305
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:10.170
<v Speaker 1>You can't do any more Instagram activity until you vote yes or no on this shit.</v>

306
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:11.971
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

307
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>So everybody's got a social media.</v>

308
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 1>They'd vote or a Facebook and it's right there pops up.</v>

309
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.200
<v Speaker 1>You can't do shit just to,</v>

310
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 1>you make that fucking boom.</v>

311
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:22.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

312
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:26.510
<v Speaker 1>but she should want and you should want to have an opinion based on something I</v>

313
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:26.710
<v Speaker 1>would say.</v>

314
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 1>How does guys sit in Merseyside,</v>

315
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.591
<v Speaker 1>Beck,</v>

316
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Dick and rustled?</v>

317
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Dawn Russell don't.</v>

318
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:37.010
<v Speaker 1>And it's four 502450145449 of the first round.</v>

319
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.610
<v Speaker 1>So right now it's four 45 four 44 so our,</v>

320
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:44.400
<v Speaker 1>our sync will be like a few seconds off.</v>

321
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:44.880
<v Speaker 1>So you should,</v>

322
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.650
<v Speaker 1>if you want to sync up to the podcast,</v>

323
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 1>just just pause your shit for a couple seconds and figure it out.</v>

324
00:09:50.251 --> 00:09:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Pitch.</v>

325
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you us to go oh shit.</v>

326
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 1>And then you see it.</v>

327
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.170
<v Speaker 1>That does happen and it's a bummer and I'm sorry,</v>

328
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:04.130
<v Speaker 1>how crazy is it that we have an actor talking crap about a presidential can't</v>

329
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.170
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

330
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:05.590
<v Speaker 1>And it and,</v>

331
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:06.950
<v Speaker 1>but he'll sway some boats too,</v>

332
00:10:06.951 --> 00:10:07.350
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>

333
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.600
<v Speaker 1>oh I loved him and go was going on.</v>

334
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.440
<v Speaker 1>So weird.</v>

335
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.630
<v Speaker 1>What's going on in this country is,</v>

336
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what's going on.</v>

337
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say no one does.</v>

338
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:17.310
<v Speaker 1>Dave Chappelle has a whole skid on the,</v>

339
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:20.340
<v Speaker 1>a while ago when when September 11th happened,</v>

340
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.280
<v Speaker 1>he said he turned on MTV.</v>

341
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

342
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck with Joe rule thinks about September 11th like he was all</v>

343
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:26.514
<v Speaker 1>over the TV.</v>

344
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Fuck is he talking about the CIA came out and just crushed Donald Trump just</v>

345
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:33.600
<v Speaker 1>like that too.</v>

346
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Not like a gangster like he just did,</v>

347
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:40.080
<v Speaker 1>but a former director of the CIA had to come out and say,</v>

348
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.123
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

349
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I got my issues with Hillary too.</v>

350
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.203
<v Speaker 1>He didn't get him to them.</v>

351
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:45.721
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

352
00:10:45.721 --> 00:10:46.770
<v Speaker 1>but Donald Trump,</v>

353
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.750
<v Speaker 1>if we allow this guy to be president,</v>

354
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.010
<v Speaker 1>it's going to fuck our country.</v>

355
00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:50.844
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

356
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I think you might even win more now cause my hell no,</v>

357
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.213
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

358
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.200
<v Speaker 1>really scared to death of Donald Trump.</v>

359
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.130
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm seeing.</v>

360
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.460
<v Speaker 1>But it almost helps because his name is out there more.</v>

361
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

362
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 1>People are seeing it.</v>

363
00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:04.531
<v Speaker 1>People are like,</v>

364
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:04.681
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

365
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:07.080
<v Speaker 1>dinero is talking about a mom in some way.</v>

366
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.531
<v Speaker 1>Almost.</v>

367
00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 1>You're right in some way,</v>

368
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:09.210
<v Speaker 1>in my mind,</v>

369
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.200
<v Speaker 1>almost help.</v>

370
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:10.711
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>

371
00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:11.544
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

372
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a long time before November.</v>

373
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean it doesn't seem like it is,</v>

374
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.480
<v Speaker 1>but it is in this weird climate.</v>

375
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Crazy shit can happen with these people.</v>

376
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.810
<v Speaker 1>How much more could come out?</v>

377
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.110
<v Speaker 1>What do you really think about Hillary?</v>

378
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't want any politician that's deeply entrenched in the political system at</v>

379
00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:31.980
<v Speaker 1>this point in terms of like who is,</v>

380
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:32.730
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

381
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.930
<v Speaker 1>who's influencing them.</v>

382
00:11:33.931 --> 00:11:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Like she's doing things like these speeches in front of these bankers where she</v>

383
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 1>gets paid a quarter million dollars.</v>

384
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.350
<v Speaker 1>You don't do those if you're on the up and up.</v>

385
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.840
<v Speaker 1>That's just a payoff.</v>

386
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Like nobody wants to see her talk for an hour.</v>

387
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:47.641
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

388
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:50.610
<v Speaker 1>She's not funny cause she's saying something but I mean she's going to motivate</v>

389
00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:51.470
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

390
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Rob Has beach all the dreaming and how and people buy it.</v>

391
00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:57.420
<v Speaker 1>This is like doesn't cook and shit.</v>

392
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.511
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

393
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:00.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like I understand what that means.</v>

394
00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.493
<v Speaker 1>What she's like,</v>

395
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:04.450
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

396
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:08.410
<v Speaker 1>she's like the classic model of the politician who is not doing anything illegal</v>

397
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's distasteful when you look at it.</v>

398
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.130
<v Speaker 1>And in terms of like a whole system,</v>

399
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 1>like the system of like these people getting these jobs or people getting,</v>

400
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

401
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:22.600
<v Speaker 1>getting things based on whether or not they donated or have donated to the</v>

402
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Clinton Foundation.</v>

403
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.870
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of issues that people were having a giant problem with.</v>

404
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:26.770
<v Speaker 1>And not me,</v>

405
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:27.581
<v Speaker 1>like someone said,</v>

406
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:29.080
<v Speaker 1>all you're buying into conspiracy theories.</v>

407
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.860
<v Speaker 1>The Washington Post isn't a fucking conspiracy website print.</v>

408
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.450
<v Speaker 1>They print a lot of stories about this.</v>

409
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>

410
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:35.550
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

411
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.610
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that don't like the connection between some politicians</v>

412
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.600
<v Speaker 1>and some special interest groups that pay them a ton of money to speak at places</v>

413
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:45.280
<v Speaker 1>like crazy money.</v>

414
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.140
<v Speaker 1>People are just tired of politicians in general.</v>

415
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.920
<v Speaker 1>That's why they've gravitated towards Trump once I agree 100% yes,</v>

416
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.320
<v Speaker 1>that's no one takes those,</v>

417
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.750
<v Speaker 1>those big speech monies.</v>

418
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.500
<v Speaker 1>You don't take that,</v>

419
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.590
<v Speaker 1>that big speech money.</v>

420
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.110
<v Speaker 1>If you're really concerned about representing the people,</v>

421
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.520
<v Speaker 1>that's your own interests,</v>

422
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Speaker 1>that's like there's a giant red flag.</v>

423
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Like it's sort of unethical,</v>

424
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.620
<v Speaker 1>but you're allowed to do it because it's not illegal technically,</v>

425
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.930
<v Speaker 1>but God damn it seems dark.</v>

426
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.170
<v Speaker 1>If you're taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from oil companies,</v>

427
00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:16.360
<v Speaker 1>then you're making decisions whether or not those oil companies are going to</v>

428
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:18.160
<v Speaker 1>profit or not based on a policy.</v>

429
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:18.971
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

430
00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:19.730
<v Speaker 1>There's a connection.</v>

431
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:20.950
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you who's really fucked.</v>

432

<v Speaker 1>he's this guy,</v>

498
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:31.383
<v Speaker 1>Billy Bush.</v>

499
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.800
<v Speaker 1>When you recognize when you see him,</v>

500
00:14:32.801 --> 00:14:33.580
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

501
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.271
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

502
00:14:34.271 --> 00:14:34.750
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

503
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.261
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

504
00:14:35.261 --> 00:14:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

505
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know how we got to this point where that's our option now.</v>

506
00:14:39.521 --> 00:14:40.354
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

507
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.580
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's the outrage that people have.</v>

508
00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:44.530
<v Speaker 1>I think this political system,</v>

509
00:14:44.531 --> 00:14:46.660
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not obviously not any kind of an expert,</v>

510
00:14:46.661 --> 00:14:48.400
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's like a battle ship.</v>

511
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it starts moving and it takes a long time to change course.</v>

512
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.271
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're now,</v>

513
00:14:53.271 --> 00:14:53.511
<v Speaker 1>we're two,</v>

514
00:14:53.511 --> 00:14:56.390
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing it change course and we're seeing the people's outrage.</v>

515
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Outrage at our peak lately.</v>

516
00:14:58.570 --> 00:14:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

517
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.150
<v Speaker 1>they are Hillary winning in the Paul.</v>

518
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

519
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:03.861
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

520
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:04.880
<v Speaker 1>There's still outrage.</v>

521
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.440
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of people that outrage.</v>

522
00:15:06.441 --> 00:15:09.080
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of people that are just going to go democratic no matter what.</v>

523
00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.830
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of people that realize that she's the better choice between the</v>

524
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:14.740
<v Speaker 1>two monsters like the leg,</v>

525
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.440
<v Speaker 1>her better.</v>

526
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Even Arnold came out against Donald Trump,</v>

527
00:15:17.241 --> 00:15:18.074
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

528

531
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:27.750
<v Speaker 2>He was nice to them.</v>

532
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:27.971

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:35.431

00:15:35.431 --> 00:15:35.640
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

539
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.473
<v Speaker 2>in his voice,</v>

540
00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.580
<v Speaker 2>I can no longer stand for someone.</v>

541
00:15:38.581 --> 00:15:38.941
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:49.560
<v Speaker 2>You don't grab the pussy.</v>

548
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.601
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

549
00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:52.780
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them would let you.</v>

550
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:53.970

<v Speaker 2>You're pro Hillary.</v>

554
00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.840
<v Speaker 2>Hillary is a good woman.</v>

555
00:16:03.841 --> 00:16:05.370
<v Speaker 2>She's just misunderstood.</v>

556
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people when they are good women,</v>

557
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.160
<v Speaker 2>they wind up suiciding themselves.</v>

558
00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.220
<v Speaker 2>The personalities is,</v>

559
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.560
<v Speaker 2>it makes you humble.</v>

560
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.630

561
00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.710
<v Speaker 1>emails is not good.</v>

562
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.440
<v Speaker 1>What does Arnold think about those emails?</v>

563
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:35.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

564
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:39.750
<v Speaker 1>The status mail issues seems very complex.</v>

565
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:44.720
<v Speaker 2>I've got to go.</v>

566
00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:45.980

580
00:17:00.581 --> 00:17:05.210
<v Speaker 1>that's a convenient connection between 330 million people in one spot and then</v>

581
00:17:05.211 --> 00:17:06.400
<v Speaker 1>something bad happens.</v>

582
00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:08.470
<v Speaker 1>You blame it on these people that set things up.</v>

583
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to set things up,</v>

584
00:17:10.001 --> 00:17:12.100
<v Speaker 1>but it is easy to take advantage of those things.</v>

585
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>

586
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:13.050
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>

587
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.320
<v Speaker 1>When it was a shooting happens.</v>

588
00:17:14.321 --> 00:17:14.621
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

589
00:17:14.621 --> 00:17:15.820
<v Speaker 1>that's what everybody wants to see.</v>

590
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.833
<v Speaker 1>So the news,</v>

591
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.780
<v Speaker 1>they're going to cover it and it does make things look,</v>

592
00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.130
<v Speaker 1>it does lighten things up,</v>

593
00:17:21.131 --> 00:17:22.900
<v Speaker 1>but like here's a perfect example.</v>

594
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember Gary Condit?</v>

595
00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Here's a perfect example of that.</v>

596
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Gary condit was a politician who was having sex with his girlfriend who was like</v>

597
00:17:31.631 --> 00:17:35.050
<v Speaker 1>a secretary or some shit like that and she was really young and she turned up</v>

598
00:17:35.051 --> 00:17:37.660
<v Speaker 1>murdered and he was under investigation.</v>

599
00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.081
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like,</v>

600
00:17:38.081 --> 00:17:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

601
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.870
<v Speaker 1>this guy murdered his politician,</v>

602
00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.340
<v Speaker 1>murder his girlfriend,</v>

603
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.590
<v Speaker 1>and then nine 11 happened.</v>

604
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:49.710
<v Speaker 1>So to think that Gary Condit set up so that he could get away with murder and</v>

605
00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:53.790
<v Speaker 1>his girlfriend is the same kind of connection that people do when a nightclub</v>

606
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:57.750
<v Speaker 1>shooting happens with a guy who was on the FBI terrorist watchlist group,</v>

607
00:17:57.751 --> 00:17:58.561
<v Speaker 1>there were a couple times,</v>

608
00:17:58.561 --> 00:17:59.091
<v Speaker 1>a couple times,</v>

609
00:17:59.091 --> 00:18:00.780
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking nightmare,</v>

610
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:01.621
<v Speaker 1>crazy person,</v>

611
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:06.030
<v Speaker 1>and also gay going to gay bars and he had a fucking truck loaded guns.</v>

612
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:06.953
<v Speaker 1>He was a nut.</v>

613
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.910
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you could get that guy and recruit him and get him to do your</v>

614
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:16.050
<v Speaker 1>bidding on a specific day so that it makes something else like g get</v>

615
00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:17.340
<v Speaker 1>overshadowed in the news.</v>

616
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an easy way to fall in,</v>

617
00:18:19.461 --> 00:18:20.430
<v Speaker 1>in that way of thinking.</v>

618
00:18:20.431 --> 00:18:24.720
<v Speaker 1>But I honestly think there's just so many events taking place that these people</v>

619
00:18:24.721 --> 00:18:27.150
<v Speaker 1>are really good at manipulating the press.</v>

620
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.750
<v Speaker 1>They're really good at focusing the national attention on things that don't</v>

621
00:18:30.751 --> 00:18:31.470
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

622
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Like gay marriage is a big one.</v>

623
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Like how often does gay marriage come up?</v>

624
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Whenever there's like a big political event,</v>

625
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.200
<v Speaker 1>less so now because it's so late.</v>

626
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.280
<v Speaker 1>But it was always like the beach ball.</v>

627
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.010
<v Speaker 1>They would bounce in the air whenever they wanted to get something in the news</v>

628
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:44.970
<v Speaker 1>that didn't matter.</v>

629
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.350
<v Speaker 1>It didn't matter to most people.</v>

630
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:46.740
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

631
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.610

635
00:18:56.041 --> 00:19:01.041
<v Speaker 4>making crew or per production company to make a fake al Qaeda Taliban videos.</v>

636

682
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.430

<v Speaker 1>What's coming up.</v>

688
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's another way to Google it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't want that.</v>

701
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.360

<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

715
00:21:15.761 --> 00:21:16.840
<v Speaker 2>They might have done that.</v>

716
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.400
<v Speaker 2>They did know Eddie.</v>

717
00:21:18.401 --> 00:21:20.200
<v Speaker 2>These these websites are horse shit.</v>

718
00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:20.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like these aren't like the best website.</v>

720
00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:27.010
<v Speaker 2>We have a website that said you saved me from a bear attack.</v>

721
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:27.520
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

722
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.353
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

723
00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:32.200
<v Speaker 2>I heard that shows a website that I killed a mountain lion with my bare hands</v>

724
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:33.430
<v Speaker 2>outside the club.</v>

725
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.710
<v Speaker 2>I disarmed a,</v>

726
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.700
<v Speaker 2>an armed gunman Pentagon paid.</v>

727
00:21:36.701 --> 00:21:36.941
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

728
00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:37.361
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>

729
00:21:37.361 --> 00:21:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Now rush it today.</v>

730
00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Now this,</v>

731
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.600
<v Speaker 2>this is where it gets interesting because Russia today is probably the one of</v>

732
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:46.930
<v Speaker 2>the most out of the this big pile of people that are reporting on this.</v>

733
00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.080
<v Speaker 2>This is a very legitimate news source.</v>

734
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.150
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of weird cause it's Russia today,</v>

735
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Speaker 2>but this is where Abby Martin was.</v>

736
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.910
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

737
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:55.420
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

738
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.253
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

739
00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:00.180
<v Speaker 2>they get away with a lot more than anything that's uh,</v>

740
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.310
<v Speaker 2>on television in the United States like CNN or something along with,</v>

741
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.070
<v Speaker 2>of course it's true like I was telling you,</v>

742
00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:06.904
<v Speaker 2>but what does it mean?</v>

743
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.920
<v Speaker 2>It means that everything we know,</v>

744
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.540
<v Speaker 2>but even if they know what they think,</v>

745
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:13.870
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

746
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.820
<v Speaker 2>they faked a $500 million worth,</v>

747
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.481
<v Speaker 2>but any,</v>

748
00:22:16.481 --> 00:22:17.200
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

749
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:17.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

750
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.750
<v Speaker 2>they keep anything that they're showing me now,</v>

751
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:24.890
<v Speaker 2>it's what I like Daniel Pearl and his family and all the shit about the Middle</v>

752
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:26.560
<v Speaker 2>East.</v>

753
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.100
<v Speaker 2>They faked $500 million worth of video.</v>

754
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.401
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

755
00:22:30.401 --> 00:22:31.234
<v Speaker 2>But we need them.</v>

756
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.360
<v Speaker 2>We need to really make sure that this is a big thing,</v>

757
00:22:34.361 --> 00:22:34.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

758
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.740
<v Speaker 2>So we really need to make sure we know what the actual facts are.</v>

759
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Just shot the pump when we just,</v>

760
00:22:39.701 --> 00:22:40.534
<v Speaker 2>we need to know.</v>

761
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.590
<v Speaker 2>We need to know,</v>

762
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.270
<v Speaker 2>but he might be the truth,</v>

763
00:22:43.271 --> 00:22:44.350
<v Speaker 2>but it might not be,</v>

764
00:22:44.351 --> 00:22:47.500
<v Speaker 2>cause there's a lot of shit that people get wrong and these fucking stories,</v>

765
00:22:47.501 --> 00:22:47.910
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

766
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:52.330
<v Speaker 2>and these things get passed on from one person to another as gospel without</v>

767
00:22:52.331 --> 00:22:53.650
<v Speaker 2>people like really looking into it.</v>

768
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.400
<v Speaker 2>But now it's really legit.</v>

769
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Said he's dropped it on that.</v>

770
00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.253
<v Speaker 2>It might be,</v>

771
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:59.710
<v Speaker 2>oh we don't know.</v>

772
00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Would you be surprised that it was a JV?</v>

773
00:23:01.331 --> 00:23:04.180
<v Speaker 2>They're paid ready to release this if it was,</v>

774
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:05.643
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

775
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.300
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean I don't,</v>

776
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.470
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean much to me.</v>

777
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:13.570
<v Speaker 2>Well all the million millions of lives of innocent civilians that have died in</v>

778
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:16.450
<v Speaker 2>the Middle East and still bombed the twin towers.</v>

779
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.033
<v Speaker 2>Those people,</v>

780
00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:19.330
<v Speaker 2>oh you fucked up.</v>

781
00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:20.503
<v Speaker 2>Oh you fucked up.</v>

782
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Cause he doing this.</v>

783
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:24.311
<v Speaker 2>He's been,</v>

784
00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:24.820
<v Speaker 2>he's baiting.</v>

785
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.653
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

786
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.190
<v Speaker 2>guys talked before September 11th round Eddie and it's fucking,</v>

787
00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.390
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

788
00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

789
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.160
<v Speaker 2>Didn't mean to pry.</v>

790
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.560
<v Speaker 2>But I liked this tower.</v>

791
00:23:35.561 --> 00:23:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Seven is that's the most obvious.</v>

792
00:23:37.451 --> 00:23:38.770
<v Speaker 2>So if someone,</v>

793
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:40.990
<v Speaker 2>if someone can look at a skyscraper,</v>

794
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.720
<v Speaker 2>go down at free fall speed and send the video.</v>

795
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.550
<v Speaker 2>What conspiracy</v>

796
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:51.550
<v Speaker 1>theorists don't don't want to see about tower seven and what it shows is how</v>

797
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.540
<v Speaker 1>slowly it actually fell apart before it totally collapsed and there was a top,</v>

798
00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.060
<v Speaker 1>there's a tower seven,</v>

799
00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:02.870
<v Speaker 1>there's an exact to what he's doing is the top to the building and it starts to</v>

800
00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:03.723
<v Speaker 1>cave.</v>

801
00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:09.050
<v Speaker 1>It's during the Trump video starts to cave in minutes before it does.</v>

802
00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 1>It starts to cave in Manson for the thing collapse.</v>

803
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:11.991
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

804
00:24:11.991 --> 00:24:14.540
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that it wasn't a controlled demolition.</v>

805
00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean it doesn't still look like I'll controlled.</v>

806
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:18.051
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

807
00:24:18.051 --> 00:24:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean it doesn't still look like a controlled demolition,</v>

808
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:25.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's entirely possible because there's diesel fires in that building</v>

809
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.440
<v Speaker 1>collapsed because it was a piece of shit building.</v>

810
00:24:27.441 --> 00:24:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Many experts have said it's impossible.</v>

811
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.610
<v Speaker 1>It's never had a pap right.</v>

812
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:32.631
<v Speaker 1>Have said that.</v>

813
00:24:32.631 --> 00:24:36.380
<v Speaker 1>So you can't say it's possible and experts are saying it's impossible.</v>

814
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Many experts are saying it's impossible,</v>

815
00:24:38.301 --> 00:24:41.330
<v Speaker 1>but many other experts are disagreeing with that.</v>

816
00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:42.743
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an expert.</v>

817
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're paid off cause he don't.</v>

818
00:24:44.841 --> 00:24:45.770
<v Speaker 1>You think that that would get out?</v>

819
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're paid off.</v>

820
00:24:47.061 --> 00:24:47.900
<v Speaker 1>They might be paid off.</v>

821
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:52.190
<v Speaker 1>You might be right next to it might be that the stuff that we don't understand</v>

822
00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:53.900
<v Speaker 1>about what's common mother fucking sense.</v>

823
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.661
<v Speaker 1>You got it.</v>

824
00:24:54.661 --> 00:24:56.870
<v Speaker 1>There's enough circumstantial evidence.</v>

825
00:24:56.871 --> 00:25:01.871
<v Speaker 1>There's fucking video of the building collapsing at free fall speed according to</v>

826
00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:04.790
<v Speaker 1>the official story was free fall speed.</v>

827
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.080
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>

828
00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't have an engineer and</v>

829
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.760
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to have an engineering degree.</v>

830
00:25:10.761 --> 00:25:12.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be a professional,</v>

831
00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.880
<v Speaker 1>a race car driver to know someone's drag racing a car.</v>

832
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.960
<v Speaker 1>You could tell by seeing it and you're hearing enough unbiased.</v>

833
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.760
<v Speaker 1>A structural engineers,</v>

834
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:23.600
<v Speaker 1>chemists,</v>

835
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.200
<v Speaker 1>but one after another band.</v>

836
00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:26.540
<v Speaker 1>But here,</v>

837
00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.660
<v Speaker 1>let me stop you for a second.</v>

838
00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Them with common sense,</v>

839
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.211
<v Speaker 1>but Eddie,</v>

840
00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:30.230
<v Speaker 1>let me stop you for a second.</v>

841
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.340
<v Speaker 1>You're only listening to the ones that want to think that it happened that way.</v>

842
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.940
<v Speaker 1>There are a bunch of other ones that don't think that.</v>

843
00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:38.570
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

844
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.403
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing</v>

845
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:41.890
<v Speaker 1>that's incredible.</v>

846
00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:43.610
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking incredible.</v>

847
00:25:43.611 --> 00:25:46.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a scientist and I'm not a structural engineer.</v>

848
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:49.010
<v Speaker 1>So when there's a bunch of structural engineers arguing,</v>

849
00:25:49.011 --> 00:25:52.700
<v Speaker 1>you just have to have a third grade education to see that fucking,</v>

850
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.561
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember what,</v>

851
00:25:53.561 --> 00:25:56.180
<v Speaker 1>it's great when you go over bombing.</v>

852
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Great Shit that Stephan Struve's about to fight here.</v>

853
00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:01.493
<v Speaker 1>He's tall.</v>

854
00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.660
<v Speaker 1>He's tall as fuck.</v>

855
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Change the subject case.</v>

856
00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:05.090
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

857
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.691
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>

858
00:26:05.691 --> 00:26:06.524
<v Speaker 1>He's tall.</v>

859
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:07.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

861
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:09.890

862
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:10.251
<v Speaker 1>Daniel.</v>

863
00:26:10.251 --> 00:26:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Aman.</v>

864
00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.423
<v Speaker 1>Check.</v>

865
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:13.671
<v Speaker 1>Check.</v>

866
00:26:13.671 --> 00:26:14.391
<v Speaker 1>He's not rip.</v>

867
00:26:14.391 --> 00:26:14.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

868
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:15.051
<v Speaker 1>he's never,</v>

869
00:26:15.051 --> 00:26:16.460
<v Speaker 1>he seven foot for sure.</v>

870
00:26:16.461 --> 00:26:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Pick up a basketball.</v>

871
00:26:17.331 --> 00:26:18.260
<v Speaker 1>So you a giant dude.</v>

872
00:26:18.261 --> 00:26:19.094
<v Speaker 1>And he's been,</v>

873
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.450
<v Speaker 1>he's been training a lot with Henry hoofed training with the black zillions now.</v>

874
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.800
<v Speaker 1>I liked his pad work,</v>

875
00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:25.071
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

876
00:26:25.071 --> 00:26:26.900
<v Speaker 1>What did I say to move his last fight?</v>

877
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:28.040
<v Speaker 1>He got knocked out.</v>

878
00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:28.911
<v Speaker 1>Is that what I know?</v>

879
00:26:28.911 --> 00:26:29.041
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

880
00:26:29.041 --> 00:26:29.874
<v Speaker 1>it's last fight.</v>

881
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I think he won his last fight on his last day.</v>

882
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:33.180
<v Speaker 1>He beat no guarantee.</v>

883
00:26:33.181 --> 00:26:33.861
<v Speaker 1>Beat big foot.</v>

884
00:26:33.861 --> 00:26:35.510
<v Speaker 1>He got knocked out by Overeem,</v>

885
00:26:35.511 --> 00:26:37.190
<v Speaker 1>but I think that was three fights ago.</v>

886
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Correct?</v>

887
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.430
<v Speaker 1>And he probably,</v>

888
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:40.701
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

889
00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:42.200
<v Speaker 1>he knocked him out and he stopped him.</v>

890
00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Give him seven foot.</v>

891
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:44.550
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

892
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think it's him.</v>

893
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.650
<v Speaker 5>He says how tall is nobody can get up there to measure them.</v>

894
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:50.130
<v Speaker 5>So you have to,</v>

895
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.900
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why I didn't take his word for sure.</v>

896
00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:53.250
<v Speaker 5>Some foot just round that out.</v>

897
00:26:53.251 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 5>I think he likes it that way.</v>

898
00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.633
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

899
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.090
<v Speaker 5>A lot of digits.</v>

900
00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:58.110
<v Speaker 5>I guess.</v>

901
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.610
<v Speaker 5>I know if he just stood up straight,</v>

902
00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 5>he was got a little bit of a slump for a seven foot he seven foot for sure.</v>

903
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:03.630
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

904
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.810
<v Speaker 5>he's a long dude and he kicked Steve Bay from way out.</v>

905
00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:07.681
<v Speaker 5>It's 20 steep.</v>

906
00:27:07.681 --> 00:27:11.040
<v Speaker 5>I made a post about it saying like how important it was for him to have lost</v>

907
00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:11.740
<v Speaker 5>this guy.</v>

908
00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.320
<v Speaker 5>Cause cause it was like,</v>

909
00:27:13.321 --> 00:27:14.790
<v Speaker 5>it really burned the fire under him.</v>

910
00:27:14.791 --> 00:27:15.960
<v Speaker 5>It was an important laws.</v>

911
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.610
<v Speaker 5>But he in the picture,</v>

912
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.550
<v Speaker 5>he's head kick and Steve Bay from across the room.</v>

913
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:22.130
<v Speaker 5>It's so crazy.</v>

914
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:22.351
<v Speaker 5>Go,</v>

915
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:23.350
<v Speaker 5>go gadget stuff.</v>

916
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:24.031
<v Speaker 5>They said,</v>

917
00:27:24.031 --> 00:27:25.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking to myself,</v>

918
00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:29.220
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck is this guy kicking me in the head from way over there for it.</v>

919
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.310
<v Speaker 5>It's a ridiculous,</v>

920
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.320
<v Speaker 5>crazy pictures.</v>

921
00:27:31.321 --> 00:27:32.420
<v Speaker 5>See if you can find a champion.</v>

922
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:34.590
<v Speaker 5>Remember Strube had the hops horrible,</v>

923
00:27:34.591 --> 00:27:34.981
<v Speaker 5>hardest.</v>

924
00:27:34.981 --> 00:27:36.510
<v Speaker 5>She man where they thousand after retire.</v>

925
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:36.661
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

926
00:27:36.661 --> 00:27:39.990
<v Speaker 5>I think he still has a heart issue and one of the things he said is he did an</v>

927
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:40.831
<v Speaker 5>interview recently,</v>

928
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:42.930
<v Speaker 5>like within this last week that he said,</v>

929
00:27:42.931 --> 00:27:43.380
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

930
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.101
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>

931
00:27:44.101 --> 00:27:44.340
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

932
00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:48.210
<v Speaker 5>it's that I'm going to be able to prove that you can win without a full use of</v>

933
00:27:48.211 --> 00:27:49.044
<v Speaker 5>your heart,</v>

934
00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:50.850
<v Speaker 5>like with a damaged heart,</v>

935
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.010
<v Speaker 5>which is crazy bitch.</v>

936
00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.013
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

937
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.640
<v Speaker 5>I would assume it affects cardio at some point.</v>

938
00:27:56.641 --> 00:27:57.410
<v Speaker 5>My God,</v>

939
00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.420
<v Speaker 5>if I have a whole heart and that bad boys working on and have a whatever,</v>

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.040
<v Speaker 5>beers knows heart.</v>

943
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.550
<v Speaker 5>Do you guys remember Mills Lane?</v>

944
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:09.811
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

945
00:28:09.811 --> 00:28:10.720
<v Speaker 5>he was the original company.</v>

946
00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.860
<v Speaker 5>It's probably a tribute to all his favorite raps,</v>

947
00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:14.520
<v Speaker 5>yet willing,</v>

948
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.370
<v Speaker 5>when binge big John McCarthy started doing it for eminent MMA.</v>

949
00:28:17.371 --> 00:28:20.970
<v Speaker 5>They sort of had an agreement like John would do it for MMA and he did it for</v>

950
00:28:20.971 --> 00:28:21.804
<v Speaker 5>boxing.</v>

951
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.153
<v Speaker 5>Let's get it all.</v>

952
00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.360
<v Speaker 5>It's a tough fight for Stru.</v>

953
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:25.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

954
00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:26.281
<v Speaker 5>it's tough for them.</v>

955
00:28:26.281 --> 00:28:28.590
<v Speaker 5>People think really good dude.</v>

956
00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.311
<v Speaker 5>He's very,</v>

957
00:28:29.311 --> 00:28:29.900
<v Speaker 5>very tough.</v>

958
00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:30.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

959
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.350
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's ever been finished.</v>

960
00:28:31.351 --> 00:28:32.370
<v Speaker 5>Only lost by decision.</v>

961
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:36.820
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen him wrestle big shoe.</v>

962
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:37.381
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

963
00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:37.981
<v Speaker 5>so big.</v>

964
00:28:37.981 --> 00:28:38.700
<v Speaker 5>He's just,</v>

965
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.200
<v Speaker 5>as he's moving away from this guy,</v>

966
00:28:40.201 --> 00:28:43.530
<v Speaker 5>you realize what a distance gap between the two.</v>

967
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.810
<v Speaker 5>You don't see him use his reach a ton though.</v>

968
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.250
<v Speaker 5>Look how much bigger he looks.</v>

969
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:47.521
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

970
00:28:47.521 --> 00:28:50.160
<v Speaker 5>I think that's something that working with hoofed will really fix.</v>

971
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.910
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

972
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.730
<v Speaker 5>If anyone's going to be Henry who yeah,</v>

973
00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:56.060
<v Speaker 5>and he's a fellow Dutchman to you.</v>

974
00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:57.743
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

975
00:28:58.850 --> 00:28:59.110
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

976
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.191
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

977
00:28:59.191 --> 00:28:59.341
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

978
00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:01.440
<v Speaker 5>There's a whole triangle on Pat Barry.</v>

979
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.190
<v Speaker 5>That was amazing.</v>

980
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:03.390
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] Presa yeah,</v>

983
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:08.640
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you where I can see strip wins by submission because think about where</v>

984
00:29:08.641 --> 00:29:12.390
<v Speaker 5>are you gonna find a seven foot Jujitsu guy to train with Schroeder to get ready</v>

985
00:29:12.391 --> 00:29:13.110
<v Speaker 5>for struve.</v>

986
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.943
<v Speaker 5>It's true,</v>

987
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.450
<v Speaker 5>but he could win by other things too.</v>

988
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:15.931
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

989
00:29:15.931 --> 00:29:16.830
<v Speaker 5>I mean he can stay there</v>

990
00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:19.170
<v Speaker 5>fucking picture.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That is so crazy.</v>

992
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:23.970
<v Speaker 5>He's kicking him from the other side of the cage.</v>

993
00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:25.530
<v Speaker 5>That is nuts.</v>

994
00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:30.030
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's like a foot difference between what Steve Bay can do to him and</v>

995
00:29:30.031 --> 00:29:31.080
<v Speaker 5>where he can hit Steve Bay.</v>

996
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:31.990
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

997
00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.690
<v Speaker 5>That's so hard to deal with.</v>

998
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.240
<v Speaker 5>It's the hardest thing to deal with it.</v>

999
00:29:35.241 --> 00:29:35.731
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1000
00:29:35.731 --> 00:29:36.960
<v Speaker 5>we just go into the left hand.</v>

1001
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:38.940
<v Speaker 5>You got to get them going backwards.</v>

1002
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:40.590
<v Speaker 5>Reaches the hardest thing to deal with.</v>

1003
00:29:40.591 --> 00:29:41.440
<v Speaker 5>An all striking.</v>

1004
00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1005

<v Speaker 6>Never gets 10 reached 10 inch advantage and reach crazy.</v>

1009

1010
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:51.933
<v Speaker 6>It's so big.</v>

1011
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.200
<v Speaker 6>That's a giant gap.</v>

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:11.041
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1160
00:33:11.041 --> 00:33:12.660
<v Speaker 1>he's like almost in a twister setup,</v>

1161
00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:15.370
<v Speaker 1>like an underneath or above twister sick.</v>

1162
00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.490
<v Speaker 1>If he pulled off a twist or,</v>

1163
00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:18.540
<v Speaker 1>I know you probably could pull it off from a,</v>

1164
00:33:18.541 --> 00:33:19.374
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1165
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.020
<v Speaker 4>Let's get this boy is tired down for sure.</v>

1166
00:33:22.021 --> 00:33:22.741
<v Speaker 4>That's a great job.</v>

1167
00:33:22.741 --> 00:33:24.270
<v Speaker 4>I strove struve is what?</v>

1168
00:33:24.271 --> 00:33:28.460
<v Speaker 4>Two 62 65 has to cut to 65 Tazi.</v>

1169
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:28.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1170
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:29.783
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

1171
00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:30.840
<v Speaker 4>We had the same answer.</v>

1172
00:33:30.841 --> 00:33:31.560
<v Speaker 4>Lex Mcmahon.</v>

1173
00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.840
<v Speaker 4>The key right there was truth.</v>

1174
00:33:32.841 --> 00:33:34.830
<v Speaker 4>Got to cut the top half.</v>

1175
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:36.930
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have to pass the whole guard at all.</v>

1176
00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.630
<v Speaker 4>And then he forced three quarter mount,</v>

1177
00:33:39.631 --> 00:33:40.680
<v Speaker 4>still didn't pass,</v>

1178
00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:42.870
<v Speaker 4>sat up and before he throws punches,</v>

1179
00:33:42.871 --> 00:33:46.350
<v Speaker 4>he actually ended up giving him the mount and then he gave us backup.</v>

1180
00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.213
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

1181
00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:52.340
<v Speaker 4>he ended up on his back because the way my is doing it is dude stays in three</v>

1182
00:33:52.801 --> 00:33:54.420
<v Speaker 4>quarter mountain clamps onto your leg.</v>

1183
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.850
<v Speaker 4>Any punches dude covers up,</v>

1184
00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:57.960
<v Speaker 4>gives him his back.</v>

1185
00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.860
<v Speaker 4>Am I never technically pass the guard so we didn't lose tonight.</v>

1186
00:34:01.861 --> 00:34:02.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to diet coke.</v>

1187
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:03.703
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1188
00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.553

1189
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:05.940

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:06.773
<v Speaker 4>Don't judge me.</v>

1191
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:07.800
<v Speaker 4>Don't judge me.</v>

1192
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.790
<v Speaker 4>It's got caffeine.</v>

1193
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:11.430
<v Speaker 4>I know you're trying to avoid caffeine.</v>

1194
00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.353
<v Speaker 4>Hell No.</v>

1195
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.110
<v Speaker 4>Courage the canvas saying it's a drug.</v>

1196
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:16.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh it isn't drug addicted to coffee.</v>

1197
00:34:16.351 --> 00:34:17.670
<v Speaker 4>So just say no to drugs.</v>

1198
00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:17.840
<v Speaker 4>Hey.</v>

1199
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.430
<v Speaker 4>So he wanted to the uh,</v>

1200
00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:22.380
<v Speaker 4>instead of punching sand on top,</v>

1201
00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:22.711
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1202
00:34:22.711 --> 00:34:23.311
<v Speaker 4>full amount.</v>

1203
00:34:23.311 --> 00:34:24.470
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to go for the submission.</v>

1204
00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:26.070
<v Speaker 4>You think that that's where he's better?</v>

1205
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:26.641
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1206
00:34:26.641 --> 00:34:27.474
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

1207
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.740
<v Speaker 4>Giving them the option.</v>

1208
00:34:28.741 --> 00:34:29.570
<v Speaker 4>We'll give them the bat.</v>

1209
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:31.110
<v Speaker 4>The guy you could give your back.</v>

1210
00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:31.750
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1211
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:32.340
<v Speaker 4>Anybody?</v>

1212
00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:32.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1213
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:34.710
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking spot.</v>

1214
00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:35.160
<v Speaker 4>Easily,</v>

1215
00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.920
<v Speaker 4>cause everyone's going to let me go to the worst spot.</v>

1216
00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:40.230
<v Speaker 4>But sometimes in this sport you can't hit to the back of the head.</v>

1217
00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.650
<v Speaker 4>So now the worst spot is kind of the same spot because yeah,</v>

1218
00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:46.500
<v Speaker 4>the only thing that's showing is the back of my head and you can get it right.</v>

1219
00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:47.690
<v Speaker 4>Most wrestlers turn.</v>

1220
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:47.851
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1221
00:34:47.851 --> 00:34:48.570
<v Speaker 4>that would be done.</v>

1222
00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:51.450
<v Speaker 1>And one thing did you got to take into consideration whenever you see a fight</v>

1223
00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.630
<v Speaker 1>and there's a ground exchange and there's a submission attempt versus a ground</v>

1224
00:34:54.631 --> 00:34:55.260
<v Speaker 1>and pound,</v>

1225
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not right or wrong.</v>

1226
00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:59.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like what he thought was there at the moment.</v>

1227
00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful thing about MMA is it all of these options are available.</v>

1228
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Is it some people like cro,</v>

1229
00:35:03.901 --> 00:35:06.990
<v Speaker 1>cop's knock out of Gabriel Gonzaga from inside the guard.</v>

1230
00:35:06.991 --> 00:35:09.020
<v Speaker 1>It was devastating elbows from inside of the guard.</v>

1231
00:35:09.021 --> 00:35:14.021
<v Speaker 1>It's like the first time we got to see like a world class striker who's gotten</v>

1232
00:35:14.491 --> 00:35:15.420
<v Speaker 1>way better at wrestling,</v>

1233
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:15.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1234
00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1235
00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.000
<v Speaker 1>your boy way better at grappling.</v>

1236
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Way Better for doom.</v>

1237
00:35:19.321 --> 00:35:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Helped them out a ton to the grill when he fought Gonzaga,</v>

1238
00:35:22.261 --> 00:35:25.730
<v Speaker 1>those elbows were so nasty level.</v>

1239
00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Really right on the UFC.</v>

1240
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:30.600
<v Speaker 1>There was so next level it's like taking a guy like a mallet pet or something</v>

1241
00:35:30.601 --> 00:35:30.990
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1242
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Or like,</v>

1243
00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:31.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1244
00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:32.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1245
00:35:32.041 --> 00:35:34.510
<v Speaker 1>I guess you know bull cow.</v>

1246
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1247
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.180
<v Speaker 1>And putting one of those guys,</v>

1248
00:35:36.181 --> 00:35:39.060
<v Speaker 1>like that level you would see from devastating,</v>

1249
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:41.820
<v Speaker 1>devastating results inside the guard.</v>

1250
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:42.540
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

1251
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.460
<v Speaker 1>that's the right way to do it for him.</v>

1252
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:45.070
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1253
00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I'll look at that.</v>

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.080
<v Speaker 1>When you get to the white area,</v>

1303
00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:06.810
<v Speaker 1>it's understood that unless shit is getting crazy,</v>

1304
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.000
<v Speaker 1>break it off.</v>

1305
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.330
<v Speaker 1>You go back to the black area.</v>

1306
00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:10.800
<v Speaker 1>So you have a giant white area.</v>

1307
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.610
<v Speaker 1>So even the white area where like say if you like you,</v>

1308
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.280
<v Speaker 1>he sunk the Darce right there and he rolled but he rolled into the white area.</v>

1309
00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:18.603
<v Speaker 1>You're breaking them up.</v>

1310
00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:18.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1311
00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:19.561
<v Speaker 1>you got plenty of time.</v>

1312
00:37:19.561 --> 00:37:20.394
<v Speaker 1>You can keep rolling.</v>

1313
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:20.611
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1314
00:37:20.611 --> 00:37:23.250
<v Speaker 1>but it's understood that if you're in the white area,</v>

1315
00:37:23.251 --> 00:37:27.180
<v Speaker 1>move back to the dark hair and if you try to like stay on the edge of the white</v>

1316
00:37:27.181 --> 00:37:27.391
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>

1317
00:37:27.391 --> 00:37:28.141
<v Speaker 1>people call you a pussy.</v>

1318
00:37:28.141 --> 00:37:28.651
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

1319
00:37:28.651 --> 00:37:28.921
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>

1320
00:37:28.921 --> 00:37:29.754
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

1321
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Is this a fight in a football field?</v>

1322
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1323
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:36.473
<v Speaker 1>Of course they do.</v>

1324
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.740
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1325
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:38.573
<v Speaker 1>We can do it.</v>

1326
00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

1327
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.060
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

1328
00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:45.960
<v Speaker 1>MMA fighting a football field.</v>

1329
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:47.820
<v Speaker 1>There's seven people there.</v>

1330
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.910
<v Speaker 1>There's not that many people do it there,</v>

1331
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.170
<v Speaker 1>but this is a great move and Russia,</v>

1332
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Russians always have the best moves.</v>

1333
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>

1334
00:37:58.830 --> 00:37:59.401
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1335
00:37:59.401 --> 00:38:01.200
<v Speaker 1>This is how the board should be played.</v>

1336
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:02.083
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1337
00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:05.700
<v Speaker 1>they're going to stay in like a 10 foot area probably.</v>

1338
00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1339
00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:08.760
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly how fight should take place.</v>

1340
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Now that I see it,</v>

1341
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm so right.</v>

1342
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.280
<v Speaker 1>This is so that he,</v>

1343
00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.000
<v Speaker 1>here's a better thing to it.</v>

1344
00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:20.460
<v Speaker 1>It would be better for them to fight in the grass then it would be for them to</v>

1345
00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:21.363
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1346
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1347
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Better.</v>

1348
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.921
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1349
00:38:22.921 --> 00:38:23.580
<v Speaker 1>it's itchy.</v>

1350
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:23.821
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1351
00:38:23.821 --> 00:38:26.130
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect because it's fucking raw.</v>

1352
00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:27.920
<v Speaker 1>It's natural dirt.</v>

1353
00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Some rocks and sand.</v>

1354
00:38:32.881 --> 00:38:33.990
<v Speaker 1>We've got to do it in sand.</v>

1355
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:35.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure this no rounds to</v>

1356
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.380
<v Speaker 5>play football,</v>

1357
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.720
<v Speaker 5>soccer on the grass,</v>

1358
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.531
<v Speaker 5>no round.</v>

1359
00:38:41.531 --> 00:38:44.770
<v Speaker 5>They just go to [inaudible] [inaudible] go off at school.</v>

1360
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.710
<v Speaker 5>Dirty feet and everybody's dirty feet and everything.</v>

1361
00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.430
<v Speaker 5>And Russia.</v>

1362
00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:51.630
<v Speaker 5>It might be battle to the death.</v>

1363
00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:53.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1364
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:54.190
<v Speaker 5>they might.</v>

1365
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:55.120
<v Speaker 5>One of them might die.</v>

1366
00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:55.511
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1367
00:38:55.511 --> 00:38:56.291
<v Speaker 5>you know what they could do?</v>

1368
00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:59.830
<v Speaker 5>One show would have a battle to the death and then everybody else would feel</v>

1369
00:38:59.831 --> 00:39:00.460
<v Speaker 5>like a pussy.</v>

1370
00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:00.910
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

1371
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:01.360
<v Speaker 5>that would,</v>

1372
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.141
<v Speaker 5>that would be the,</v>

1373
00:39:02.141 --> 00:39:02.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1374
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.131
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1375
00:39:03.131 --> 00:39:04.540
<v Speaker 5>the headliner would be a one up or,</v>

1376
00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:05.100
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1377
00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.500
<v Speaker 5>it would be every fight we'd be battle.</v>

1378
00:39:06.501 --> 00:39:07.830
<v Speaker 5>The desk guys are,</v>

1379
00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.330
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about clay gladiator days?</v>

1380
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:09.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1381
00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:10.613
<v Speaker 5>I mean we're going back,</v>

1382
00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.010
<v Speaker 5>but they did do that.</v>

1383
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:14.830
<v Speaker 5>Everybody else would feel like a pussy in Russia because they're so gangster,</v>

1384
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.501
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1385
00:39:15.501 --> 00:39:16.081
<v Speaker 5>They got something good.</v>

1386
00:39:16.081 --> 00:39:16.280
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1387
00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.470
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if Putin would fight.</v>

1388
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.511
<v Speaker 5>He wouldn't fight,</v>

1389
00:39:19.511 --> 00:39:21.920
<v Speaker 5>but his body guard would he really have a killer body armor.</v>

1390
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.490
<v Speaker 5>Crazy body tattoos takes it off.</v>

1391
00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.170
<v Speaker 5>It's all just trying to go from full guard.</v>

1392
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:27.700
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>

1393
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:28.630
<v Speaker 5>Poop would fight,</v>

1394
00:39:28.631 --> 00:39:29.620
<v Speaker 5>but he'd just have it rigged.</v>

1395
00:39:29.621 --> 00:39:32.470
<v Speaker 5>So the guy who just does these guys are super talented.</v>

1396
00:39:32.471 --> 00:39:33.304
<v Speaker 5>These are good fighters.</v>

1397
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.650
<v Speaker 5>And I liked the concept ban.</v>

1398
00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.540
<v Speaker 5>When did this take place where Jamie,</v>

1399
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:38.640
<v Speaker 5>when did I rip this idea?</v>

1400
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:42.490
<v Speaker 5>These guys are way too high level for,</v>

1401
00:39:42.491 --> 00:39:46.030
<v Speaker 5>this is in Boston 2020 it says</v>

1402
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:48.363
<v Speaker 5>interesting everybody.</v>

1403
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:49.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1404
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:50.440
<v Speaker 5>there's no way that could be like,</v>

1405
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:53.230
<v Speaker 5>isn't it funny that you could look at some MMA fights and go,</v>

1406
00:39:53.231 --> 00:39:56.290
<v Speaker 5>oh that's definitely not before 2000 oh yeah.</v>

1407
00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:56.790
<v Speaker 5>Easy.</v>

1408
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:57.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1409
00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.270
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that interesting though?</v>

1410
00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.640
<v Speaker 5>Like that's how quick that this sport has evolved.</v>

1411
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.110
<v Speaker 5>Like I can look at a guy,</v>

1412
00:40:02.111 --> 00:40:04.150
<v Speaker 5>I can look at some fights from,</v>

1413
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:04.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1414
00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.610
<v Speaker 5>you say it's like a world title fight.</v>

1415
00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:06.941
<v Speaker 5>If you get,</v>

1416
00:40:06.941 --> 00:40:07.691
<v Speaker 5>you look at it and go,</v>

1417
00:40:07.691 --> 00:40:07.781
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1418
00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:11.350
<v Speaker 5>this has gotta be like 1997 [inaudible] 98 you know,</v>

1419
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:12.700
<v Speaker 5>and then you look at even like,</v>

1420
00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:13.320
<v Speaker 5>I think I would,</v>

1421
00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.510
<v Speaker 5>doesn't get enough love Marlin Murrayas world series of fighting that Bantam</v>

1422
00:40:17.511 --> 00:40:18.344

1425
00:40:23.111 --> 00:40:23.921
<v Speaker 5>Like you look at him and go,</v>

1426
00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:25.840
<v Speaker 5>that's what I expect out of a world champion.</v>

1427
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:30.100
<v Speaker 5>He said just a master striker or combination grappler.</v>

1428
00:40:30.101 --> 00:40:32.110
<v Speaker 5>He's a real solid MMA fighter.</v>

1429
00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:32.651
<v Speaker 5>Nasty,</v>

1430
00:40:32.651 --> 00:40:33.484
<v Speaker 5>nasty fighter.</v>

1431
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.370
<v Speaker 5>He's fighting now I think starting in world series of fighting.</v>

1432
00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:37.443
<v Speaker 5>Did they make,</v>

1433

1435
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:43.240

<v Speaker 5>And Him and Vinny were both in the UFC so they got a lot of guys jumped.</v>

1443
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.920
<v Speaker 5>John Howard Posner,</v>

1444
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:58.920
<v Speaker 5>rs and then they also got uh,</v>

1445
00:40:59.020 --> 00:40:59.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1446
00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:01.600
<v Speaker 5>my boy Jake shields and Fitch.</v>

1447
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:02.171
<v Speaker 5>Fitch.</v>

1448
00:41:02.171 --> 00:41:03.004
<v Speaker 5>That's a good fine.</v>

1449
00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:06.200
<v Speaker 5>That is the same night as the UFC fight in 'em.</v>

1450
00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.410
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the same night as the UFC fight in New York City.</v>

1451
00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.940
<v Speaker 5>But you fucked up world series.</v>

1452
00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.310
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1453
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:11.620
<v Speaker 5>that's a tough draw.</v>

1454
00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:14.410
<v Speaker 5>They get to the weekend.</v>

1455
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.670
<v Speaker 5>Everyone fucked up.</v>

1456
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:16.061
<v Speaker 5>Yo,</v>

1457
00:41:16.061 --> 00:41:16.250
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

1458
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:16.630
<v Speaker 5>let's go.</v>

1459
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:17.650
<v Speaker 5>Let's get busy with this.</v>

1460
00:41:17.651 --> 00:41:19.480
<v Speaker 5>What do you think about this Brendan Shop?</v>

1461
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.920
<v Speaker 5>I am very excited about this fight.</v>

1462
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.950
<v Speaker 5>I think people are fucking sleeping on Eddie Alvarez.</v>

1463
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.480
<v Speaker 5>I think he's a dangerous,</v>

1464
00:41:25.481 --> 00:41:29.290
<v Speaker 5>dangerous 155 pounder that motherfucker can punch.</v>

1465
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:30.520
<v Speaker 5>He punches hard,</v>

1466
00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:31.660
<v Speaker 5>he's fast as fuck.</v>

1467
00:41:31.661 --> 00:41:34.400
<v Speaker 5>And it does not a human alive that's more game than that kid.</v>

1468
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:37.310
<v Speaker 5>I agree 100% that do to you if you've never seen him fight before.</v>

1469
00:41:37.311 --> 00:41:40.730
<v Speaker 5>You got to watch his fights in Bella toy with chandeliers and dream.</v>

1470
00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.890
<v Speaker 5>She just fights him dream.</v>

1471
00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.980
<v Speaker 5>And Michael Chandler is another dude who's out there who is world class that</v>

1472
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:48.500
<v Speaker 5>could easily be fighting and winning in the UFC.</v>

1473
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:50.510
<v Speaker 5>And you see it now with Eddie Alvarez.</v>

1474
00:41:50.511 --> 00:41:53.570
<v Speaker 5>Cause it took a while for Eddie to get comfortable in the UFC.</v>

1475
00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:54.320
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

1476
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.040
<v Speaker 5>Donald worked him over and his first fight because dismantled,</v>

1477
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.650
<v Speaker 5>budge on.</v>

1478
00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:01.970
<v Speaker 5>But now he's training with your book Mark Henry.</v>

1479
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:03.340
<v Speaker 5>And look,</v>

1480
00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:05.030
<v Speaker 5>Connor's a goddamn phenom.</v>

1481
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:05.560
<v Speaker 5>And he's uh,</v>

1482
00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.860
<v Speaker 5>he's got as for Rasa,</v>

1483
00:42:06.861 --> 00:42:10.040
<v Speaker 5>hobby lexicon at the touch of death in his hands.</v>

1484
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:11.120
<v Speaker 5>That's a scary fight,</v>

1485
00:42:11.121 --> 00:42:11.301
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1486
00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:14.870
<v Speaker 5>Anyone who thinks it's a easy fight or not a big fight for Conor is they just</v>

1487
00:42:14.871 --> 00:42:17.360
<v Speaker 5>don't know the sport out of their time on the underground king,</v>

1488
00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:21.440
<v Speaker 5>I think at 55 and everyone knows I'm the biggest con or nut writer in the world</v>

1489
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.620
<v Speaker 5>at 55 I just don't see a ton of success there.</v>

1490
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:25.970
<v Speaker 5>I think Eddie Alvarez,</v>

1491
00:42:25.971 --> 00:42:27.170
<v Speaker 5>if you look at the top five,</v>

1492
00:42:27.171 --> 00:42:27.861
<v Speaker 5>we've talked about this before,</v>

1493
00:42:27.861 --> 00:42:28.694
<v Speaker 5>you're like the top five.</v>

1494
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:33.500
<v Speaker 5>It's his easiest matchup and that's a fucking nightmare for him cause he can</v>

1495
00:42:33.501 --> 00:42:34.700
<v Speaker 5>grapples ass off.</v>

1496
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.470
<v Speaker 5>He's been so many big fights.</v>

1497
00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:37.730
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't get tired.</v>

1498
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.560
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't mind winning by decision.</v>

1499
00:42:39.561 --> 00:42:42.170
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't get tired and he's a bigger grandpa.</v>

1500
00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:42.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1501
00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:47.370
<v Speaker 5>those are two and he can't fucking crack and look at his resume and just resume</v>

1502
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:48.230
<v Speaker 5>crisp man.</v>

1503
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:49.580
<v Speaker 5>He's got crisp striking.</v>

1504
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:51.290
<v Speaker 5>He's not an easy guy to hit.</v>

1505
00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.040
<v Speaker 5>You know you can hit him and he gets rocked and he survives.</v>

1506
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:56.630
<v Speaker 5>If you watch his Chandler fights,</v>

1507
00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:01.190
<v Speaker 5>Eddie Alvarez got rocked and survived against Chandler and a couple other guys</v>

1508
00:43:01.191 --> 00:43:02.630
<v Speaker 5>over in Bella to think about how,</v>

1509
00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.640
<v Speaker 5>how's Connor win this fight?</v>

1510
00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.120
<v Speaker 5>You go through it has to knock him out.</v>

1511
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:06.260
<v Speaker 5>He has five rounds and document.</v>

1512
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:07.670
<v Speaker 5>You're not winning decision against that.</v>

1513
00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:08.660
<v Speaker 5>He could win a decision.</v>

1514
00:43:08.661 --> 00:43:09.440
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

1515
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:09.921
<v Speaker 5>I disagree.</v>

1516
00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:12.320
<v Speaker 5>Why do you worry about the fight with Gilbert Melendez?</v>

1517
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.240
<v Speaker 5>Eddie wanted decision in the Gilbert Melendez.</v>

1518
00:43:14.241 --> 00:43:14.600
<v Speaker 5>Fine.</v>

1519
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:14.931
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

1520
00:43:14.931 --> 00:43:16.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying Edwin's by decision.</v>

1521
00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:16.640
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1522
00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.280
<v Speaker 5>You don't think that Connor could beat him in a similar fight?</v>

1523
00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:19.940
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1524
00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:20.330
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1525
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:21.490
<v Speaker 5>You don't get the same dances.</v>

1526
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:22.071
<v Speaker 5>The endurance,</v>

1527
00:43:22.071 --> 00:43:25.250
<v Speaker 5>the takedowns to grappling with the striking as the rounds go on,</v>

1528
00:43:25.251 --> 00:43:26.360
<v Speaker 5>the knockout power goes down.</v>

1529
00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.400
<v Speaker 5>Do you think people sleep on Alvarez wrestling?</v>

1530
00:43:28.401 --> 00:43:29.300
<v Speaker 5>Cause I think they forget,</v>

1531
00:43:29.301 --> 00:43:30.630
<v Speaker 5>I forget how good of a wrestler.</v>

1532
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:31.820
<v Speaker 5>His and his insurance.</v>

1533
00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.360
<v Speaker 5>It's a steering college.</v>

1534
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:34.303
<v Speaker 5>Where did he wrestle?</v>

1535
00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:35.930
<v Speaker 5>He was a high level guy.</v>

1536
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:37.123
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1537
00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:38.963
<v Speaker 5>Division One.</v>

1538
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:40.063
<v Speaker 5>All American.</v>

1539
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:41.061
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure.</v>

1540
00:43:41.061 --> 00:43:41.840
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

1541
00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:42.601
<v Speaker 5>compared to Connor,</v>

1542
00:43:42.601 --> 00:43:43.670
<v Speaker 5>he's fucking Dan Gable.</v>

1543
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:43.941
<v Speaker 5>Yo,</v>

1544
00:43:43.941 --> 00:43:44.774
<v Speaker 5>this fight,</v>

1545
00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:45.980
<v Speaker 5>this fight is nasty,</v>

1546
00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:46.850
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1547
00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:47.631
<v Speaker 5>We all know that.</v>

1548
00:43:47.631 --> 00:43:48.291
<v Speaker 5>Those guys,</v>

1549
00:43:48.291 --> 00:43:48.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is,</v>

1550
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.670
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about Jimmy man.</v>

1551
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.983
<v Speaker 5>It's about to go down.</v>

1552
00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:51.770
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1553
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:52.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying this fight's nasty.</v>

1554
00:43:52.881 --> 00:43:54.560
<v Speaker 5>Just does not confused people at home.</v>

1555
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:55.530
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>

1556
00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:56.630
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you man.</v>

1557
00:43:56.631 --> 00:43:57.890
<v Speaker 5>I think people sleep on them.</v>

1558
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:59.010
<v Speaker 5>It's easy.</v>

1559
00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:02.960
<v Speaker 5>You've rolled with like a real division one wrestler and you realize how fucking</v>

1560
00:44:02.961 --> 00:44:05.750
<v Speaker 5>strong the wrestling is all American.</v>

1561
00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:06.531
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1562
00:44:06.531 --> 00:44:07.410
<v Speaker 5>that's high school,</v>

1563
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:08.841
<v Speaker 5>National Prep,</v>

1564
00:44:08.841 --> 00:44:09.674
<v Speaker 5>all American.</v>

1565
00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:11.421
<v Speaker 5>What is,</v>

1566
00:44:11.421 --> 00:44:12.170
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1567
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:13.660
<v Speaker 5>what does his college wrestling record?</v>

1568
00:44:13.661 --> 00:44:14.480
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have one yet.</v>

1569
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.470
<v Speaker 5>No college wrestling.</v>

1570
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.360
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't say as college wrestling.</v>

1571
00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.440
<v Speaker 5>And he got us rustling and fricking dream.</v>

1572
00:44:21.441 --> 00:44:22.274
<v Speaker 5>How about that?</v>

1573
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:27.680
<v Speaker 5>He bypassed that career and went right into MMA.</v>

1574
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.720
<v Speaker 5>So he wasn't high level high school Russell,</v>

1575
00:44:29.721 --> 00:44:32.430
<v Speaker 5>which is not as impressive as a college wrestler.</v>

1576
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:34.290
<v Speaker 5>But when you see him wrestle,</v>

1577
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:34.681
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1578
00:44:34.681 --> 00:44:35.760
<v Speaker 5>he's got some skills.</v>

1579
00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.590
<v Speaker 5>Does he like to stand up though?</v>

1580
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.920
<v Speaker 5>He loves standard trade and get back on and just wants to stand up.</v>

1581
00:44:40.921 --> 00:44:41.880
<v Speaker 5>Obviously he's too smart.</v>

1582
00:44:41.881 --> 00:44:43.290
<v Speaker 5>He's been in some with some of the best,</v>

1583
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:43.591
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1584
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:45.510
<v Speaker 5>So Connor is not an easy take down though.</v>

1585
00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:47.300
<v Speaker 5>Even now to high school champ.</v>

1586
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.790
<v Speaker 5>Chad Mendez begs to differ times or,</v>

1587
00:44:49.791 --> 00:44:51.030
<v Speaker 5>I mean as time goes on,</v>

1588
00:44:51.031 --> 00:44:54.090
<v Speaker 5>he's going to be harder and harder to get that.</v>

1589
00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:56.400
<v Speaker 5>Chad Mendez fight though in Connor's defense,</v>

1590
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:58.920
<v Speaker 5>he had a pretty fucked up knee and that fight and he was shooting.</v>

1591
00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:00.870
<v Speaker 5>He was getting stem cell injections in his knee,</v>

1592
00:45:00.871 --> 00:45:03.330
<v Speaker 5>but that's also the only wrestle we've seen Conor fight.</v>

1593
00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:03.960
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>

1594
00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.970
<v Speaker 5>Taken down pretty effort loosely.</v>

1595
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:06.451
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1596
00:45:06.451 --> 00:45:06.841
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>

1597
00:45:06.841 --> 00:45:08.130
<v Speaker 5>Then that's the only,</v>

1598
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.010
<v Speaker 5>that's the only thing we can go off of it and say,</v>

1599
00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:10.830
<v Speaker 5>I got a bad knee.</v>

1600
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:11.663
<v Speaker 5>I get that.</v>

1601
00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:12.841
<v Speaker 5>It's a tough fight,</v>

1602
00:45:12.841 --> 00:45:13.080
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1603
00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:15.210
<v Speaker 5>But people think congressmen walked those guys.</v>

1604
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.230
<v Speaker 5>They don't know the sport,</v>

1605
00:45:16.231 --> 00:45:16.560
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1606
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.370
<v Speaker 5>I saw the violent,</v>

1607
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:18.210
<v Speaker 5>oh fuck.</v>

1608
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.780
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>

1609
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.040
<v Speaker 5>But also I could see Connor just smirking ham.</v>

1610
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:22.800
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1611
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:23.940
<v Speaker 5>That's how common is going to win.</v>

1612
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:24.300
<v Speaker 5>He's going to,</v>

1613
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:24.421
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

1614
00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:25.231
<v Speaker 5>if Connor wins,</v>

1615
00:45:25.231 --> 00:45:26.050
<v Speaker 5>he's going to Mirko.</v>

1616
00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:28.980
<v Speaker 5>Connor has some vicious fucking power in his hands.</v>

1617
00:45:28.981 --> 00:45:30.270
<v Speaker 5>Has Ed been knocked out?</v>

1618
00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:31.713
<v Speaker 5>He's been stopped.</v>

1619
00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.420
<v Speaker 5>He Chandler stopped me rear naked,</v>

1620
00:45:33.421 --> 00:45:35.310
<v Speaker 5>choke him and beat him for the title.</v>

1621
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:36.900
<v Speaker 5>I'm knocked out.</v>

1622
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.400
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's been knocked out.</v>

1623
00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.313
<v Speaker 5>I do not think so.</v>

1624
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:41.730
<v Speaker 5>Some dog fights.</v>

1625
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.350
<v Speaker 5>He's just his game as they come.</v>

1626
00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:46.920
<v Speaker 5>I think he's one of those guys that fights at his very best when he's scared.</v>

1627
00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:47.260
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

1628
00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.400
<v Speaker 5>I think that's going to be one of the best things about this fight is that he</v>

1629
00:45:50.401 --> 00:45:52.130
<v Speaker 5>thinks Conor is a dangerous motherfucker.</v>

1630
00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:55.320
<v Speaker 5>Just like he thought hot failed Dos Anjos he stopped though sign jokes in the</v>

1631
00:45:55.321 --> 00:45:55.920
<v Speaker 5>first round.</v>

1632
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.180
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of people,</v>

1633
00:45:57.181 --> 00:45:58.080
<v Speaker 5>including me,</v>

1634
00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.980
<v Speaker 5>we're making the argument that Dos Anjos,</v>

1635
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.620
<v Speaker 5>if you look at the guys he's beaten,</v>

1636
00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:04.410
<v Speaker 5>stop cowboy in the first round,</v>

1637
00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.970
<v Speaker 5>beat the shit out of Nate Diaz,</v>

1638
00:46:05.971 --> 00:46:07.740
<v Speaker 5>had us beat Pettis up,</v>

1639
00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:08.490
<v Speaker 5>stopped.</v>

1640
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:08.820
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1641
00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.620
<v Speaker 5>Ben Henderson crushed him.</v>

1642
00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:10.981
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1643
00:46:10.981 --> 00:46:12.600
<v Speaker 5>you look at all the guys that he's beaten,</v>

1644
00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.480
<v Speaker 5>there's a real argument that he's one of the best lightweight of all time.</v>

1645
00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.120
<v Speaker 5>And then Eddie went and stopped him in the first round,</v>

1646
00:46:18.121 --> 00:46:19.620
<v Speaker 5>so I thought he was gonna get murdered.</v>

1647
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:20.041
<v Speaker 5>Like you went,</v>

1648
00:46:20.041 --> 00:46:20.660
<v Speaker 5>thought Eddie was just,</v>

1649
00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:22.470
<v Speaker 5>you can get it shows a huge,</v>

1650
00:46:22.471 --> 00:46:26.010
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't have the marquee name recognition type thing.</v>

1651
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:26.720
<v Speaker 5>They don't know him yet.</v>

1652
00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.250
<v Speaker 5>Dangerous fight for economy because he has such a big name.</v>

1653
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.113
<v Speaker 5>But yeah.</v>

1654
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.313
<v Speaker 5>What if,</v>

1655
00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:32.161
<v Speaker 5>if Connor does,</v>

1656
00:46:32.161 --> 00:46:35.220
<v Speaker 5>when you imagine the 55 belt holder is crazy and the,</v>

1657
00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:36.773
<v Speaker 5>and the flat,</v>

1658
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.400
<v Speaker 5>and then I think you'll forget about Tony.</v>

1659
00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:39.530
<v Speaker 5>Tony.</v>

1660
00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:39.690
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1661
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:39.811
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1662
00:46:39.811 --> 00:46:41.040
<v Speaker 5>we're not forgetting about them for sure,</v>

1663
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:44.550
<v Speaker 5>but I think the thing about Eddie Alvarez is that he has the title and that's</v>

1664
00:46:44.551 --> 00:46:45.690
<v Speaker 5>why it's sellable.</v>

1665
00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.200
<v Speaker 5>If it was just Conor McGregor versus Eddie Alvarez,</v>

1666
00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:49.050
<v Speaker 5>they didn't have the title.</v>

1667
00:46:49.051 --> 00:46:49.831
<v Speaker 5>You can't sell it.</v>

1668
00:46:49.831 --> 00:46:50.300
<v Speaker 5>It's just that.</v>

1669
00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:50.520
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1670
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.040
<v Speaker 5>because it's so good to Miller garden stuck in the middle.</v>

1671
00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:55.400
<v Speaker 5>So valuable because we realize how valuable that title,</v>

1672
00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:59.340
<v Speaker 5>because Tony is right in there in my opinion,</v>

1673
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:02.840
<v Speaker 5>as his Barboza as as a couple of Habib number go.</v>

1674
00:47:02.841 --> 00:47:03.990
<v Speaker 5>Madoff is of car course.</v>

1675
00:47:03.991 --> 00:47:04.920
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's first choice.</v>

1676
00:47:04.921 --> 00:47:05.700
<v Speaker 5>He's undefeated.</v>

1677
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.260
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's been able to deal with that graph.</v>

1678
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:10.130
<v Speaker 5>Suplex your face nasty fucking striker too.</v>

1679
00:47:10.131 --> 00:47:10.964
<v Speaker 5>And he going to give him,</v>

1680
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:12.990
<v Speaker 5>give him a place fighting.</v>

1681
00:47:12.991 --> 00:47:14.900
<v Speaker 5>He's fighting Michael Johnson and the Max.</v>

1682
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:15.360
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1683
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.051
<v Speaker 5>And that car,</v>

1684
00:47:16.051 --> 00:47:17.490
<v Speaker 5>that's a fucking great fight.</v>

1685
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:18.211
<v Speaker 5>Johnson,</v>

1686
00:47:18.211 --> 00:47:19.560
<v Speaker 5>just coming off of the knockout of poor.</v>

1687
00:47:19.561 --> 00:47:20.130
<v Speaker 5>Yay.</v>

1688
00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.150
<v Speaker 5>That's a great fight.</v>

1689
00:47:21.151 --> 00:47:21.984
<v Speaker 5>Great fight.</v>

1690
00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.490
<v Speaker 5>Sound on the main card.</v>

1691
00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.260
<v Speaker 5>Yay.</v>

1692
00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.093
<v Speaker 5>It's the best work.</v>

1693
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:25.943
<v Speaker 5>Let's be real.</v>

1694
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:28.080
<v Speaker 5>We always argue what's the best UFC fight card.</v>

1695
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:29.270
<v Speaker 5>That's the best UFC fight card.</v>

1696
00:47:29.271 --> 00:47:30.220
<v Speaker 5>The ball diamond</v>

1697
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:30.610
<v Speaker 1>clothes.</v>

1698
00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:32.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like by far holds up.</v>

1699
00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:32.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1700
00:47:32.711 --> 00:47:33.544
<v Speaker 1>If it holds up,</v>

1701
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:34.783
<v Speaker 1>what's the lineup?</v>

1702
00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:35.763
<v Speaker 1>Can I say it?</v>

1703
00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.760
<v Speaker 1>The lean and the lineup is fucking insane.</v>

1704
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.750
<v Speaker 1>You have three world title fights.</v>

1705
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.970
<v Speaker 1>You have hours versus Conor Mcgregor.</v>

1706
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.470
<v Speaker 1>You have Tyron Woodley's fighting Wonderboy.</v>

1707
00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:49.570
<v Speaker 1>People forget that to Steven happening because everybody's talking about other</v>

1708
00:47:49.571 --> 00:47:49.781
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>

1709
00:47:49.781 --> 00:47:50.680
<v Speaker 1>They forget this fight.</v>

1710
00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:51.700
<v Speaker 1>How about you Andrea and Jay?</v>

1711
00:47:51.701 --> 00:47:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Check Versus Carolina K voce.</v>

1712
00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:54.124
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

1713
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

1714
00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's even talking about that and then you have Chris,</v>

1715
00:47:57.821 --> 00:48:00.730
<v Speaker 1>why I met versus Yell All motherfucking Romero.</v>

1716
00:48:00.731 --> 00:48:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1717
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Then our boy cowboy counseling this Kelvin Kelvin and look at this mission first</v>

1718
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.450
<v Speaker 1>is Raquel Pennington got a fucking fire fights.</v>

1719
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.111
<v Speaker 1>Never met.</v>

1720
00:48:14.111 --> 00:48:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Raquel Pennington is one of the best Bantam weight in the world.</v>

1721
00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Nobody talks about her because she's,</v>

1722
00:48:18.911 --> 00:48:22.150
<v Speaker 1>she's won some fights in a crazy way like the Ashley Evan Smith fight.</v>

1723
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:23.460
<v Speaker 1>She's had some great,</v>

1724
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:24.431
<v Speaker 1>but she looks,</v>

1725
00:48:24.431 --> 00:48:26.800
<v Speaker 1>she took Holly Holm to fucking split decision I had.</v>

1726
00:48:26.801 --> 00:48:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Those girls have lost a lot though.</v>

1727

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.820
<v Speaker 1>he had muscles that would start above his ears.</v>

1780
00:49:48.671 --> 00:49:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1781
00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:50.200
<v Speaker 1>he was so big.</v>

1782
00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.640
<v Speaker 1>He was so powerful.</v>

1783
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.990
<v Speaker 1>One of the best box.</v>

1784
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.920
<v Speaker 1>He was the most feared and Barboza of like 10 years ago.</v>

1785
00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:57.813
<v Speaker 1>Look at him right there.</v>

1786
00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Good for he's big or boat but Barboza man.</v>

1787
00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Well he was a big deal.</v>

1788
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember he fought Martin [inaudible] was tooling Martin Kampmann until</v>

1789
00:50:06.251 --> 00:50:07.320
<v Speaker 1>he went for the take down.</v>

1790
00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.273
<v Speaker 1>Out of nowhere.</v>

1791
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:09.370
<v Speaker 1>He was winning.</v>

1792
00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:10.293
<v Speaker 1>He had him hurt.</v>

1793
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.530
<v Speaker 1>He had them staggered and someone told them to go for the takedown.</v>

1794
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1795
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.113
<v Speaker 1>and you get your cotton.</v>

1796
00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:16.151
<v Speaker 1>So someone should be,</v>

1797
00:50:16.151 --> 00:50:20.350
<v Speaker 1>first time I seen him fight it was at a small show at a high school in Chicago.</v>

1798
00:50:20.351 --> 00:50:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Jason Chambers fought to,</v>

1799
00:50:21.571 --> 00:50:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

1800
00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's right.</v>

1801
00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:27.190
<v Speaker 1>He's an American top team guy and man,</v>

1802
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.063
<v Speaker 1>he</v>

1803
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.293
<v Speaker 5>from that fight,</v>

1804
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:30.171
<v Speaker 5>it was pretty,</v>

1805
00:50:30.171 --> 00:50:32.510
<v Speaker 5>it was quite clear that he was going to have a serious career.</v>

1806
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:34.490
<v Speaker 5>Was he bodied on Holy Shit.</v>

1807
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:35.670
<v Speaker 5>Tacos was always bodied up.</v>

1808
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:36.021
<v Speaker 5>But not,</v>

1809
00:50:36.021 --> 00:50:38.270
<v Speaker 5>well actually when he spot phots Spencer Fisher,</v>

1810
00:50:38.271 --> 00:50:39.021
<v Speaker 5>Spencer Fisher,</v>

1811
00:50:39.021 --> 00:50:40.670
<v Speaker 5>people don't remember Spencer,</v>

1812
00:50:40.671 --> 00:50:44.960
<v Speaker 5>that King motherfucking Fisher Triangle Spencer who was a skillful,</v>

1813
00:50:44.961 --> 00:50:48.110
<v Speaker 5>skillful and he caught Tiago with a triangle.</v>

1814
00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:50.780
<v Speaker 5>But I think Tiago was only like 20 years old at the time.</v>

1815
00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:52.040
<v Speaker 5>I think he was super,</v>

1816
00:50:52.041 --> 00:50:52.874
<v Speaker 5>super young,</v>

1817
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.100
<v Speaker 5>but I think that was Seattle's first fight in the UFC,</v>

1818
00:50:55.101 --> 00:50:55.934
<v Speaker 5>if I remember right.</v>

1819
00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:56.631
<v Speaker 5>It was finding that,</v>

1820
00:50:56.631 --> 00:50:56.761
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1821
00:50:56.761 --> 00:50:58.910
<v Speaker 5>at 19 or 29 he was young,</v>

1822
00:50:58.940 --> 00:50:59.600
<v Speaker 5>real young,</v>

1823
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.410
<v Speaker 5>really young.</v>

1824
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:01.243
<v Speaker 5>But so he's,</v>

1825
00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.500
<v Speaker 5>he's looks real light now real thin.</v>

1826
00:51:03.501 --> 00:51:04.390
<v Speaker 5>And he did the,</v>

1827
00:51:04.391 --> 00:51:05.510
<v Speaker 5>the Cam Haynes thing,</v>

1828
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:06.560
<v Speaker 5>can't you,</v>

1829
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.680
<v Speaker 5>how much you lose when you had to do that big foot 200 you lost like 20 pounds,</v>

1830
00:51:09.681 --> 00:51:09.891
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1831
00:51:09.891 --> 00:51:10.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1832
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:10.560
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

1833
00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.360
<v Speaker 5>but you did it.</v>

1834
00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:14.450
<v Speaker 5>He did in the most gangster way because it had one 80 he was,</v>

1835
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:15.860
<v Speaker 5>he was not fat.</v>

1836
00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.950
<v Speaker 5>So what he had to do was he had to make his body eat itself.</v>

1837
00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:24.340
<v Speaker 5>You have to burn off 3000 calories and take in one or taking him to,</v>

1838
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.600
<v Speaker 5>I did four and three,</v>

1839
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:27.261
<v Speaker 5>four and three.</v>

1840
00:51:27.261 --> 00:51:28.000
<v Speaker 5>So there you go.</v>

1841
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:28.210
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

1842
00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:29.660
<v Speaker 5>you burn that off that way.</v>

1843
00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:30.770
<v Speaker 5>So how'd you do it?</v>

1844
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:34.450
<v Speaker 5>You body eats itself running just running nonstop 20 miles a day.</v>

1845
00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:35.960
<v Speaker 5>They supplies the VSP,</v>

1846
00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:36.750
<v Speaker 5>hit the twist tree.</v>

1847
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:40.840
<v Speaker 5>This is a good crazy ass fight and Jimmy man was a nasty strike or someone's</v>

1848
00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:41.450
<v Speaker 5>getting knocked down.</v>

1849
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:45.680
<v Speaker 5>So inside leg kick someone's getting knocked out and Manoa has been in camp with</v>

1850
00:51:45.681 --> 00:51:46.460
<v Speaker 5>Gustafson.</v>

1851
00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:49.220
<v Speaker 5>Who he fought actually Gustafson stopped him.</v>

1852
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:50.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1853
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:51.860
<v Speaker 5>but man was really good.</v>

1854
00:51:51.861 --> 00:51:52.310
<v Speaker 5>He's just,</v>

1855
00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:54.170
<v Speaker 5>he hasn't been fighting for that long.</v>

1856
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:55.040
<v Speaker 5>It's really interesting.</v>

1857
00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:58.160
<v Speaker 5>He didn't start martial arts I think til he was like 28 years old.</v>

1858
00:51:58.260 --> 00:51:58.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1859
00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:00.980
<v Speaker 5>he was in I to say prison for a while in England.</v>

1860
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:02.390
<v Speaker 5>How dare you just make that up.</v>

1861
00:52:02.391 --> 00:52:03.030
<v Speaker 5>You didn't even know.</v>

1862
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:04.640
<v Speaker 5>It's like tower seven all over again.</v>

1863
00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:10.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm almost positive he did some time needs to get on the social media thing</v>

1864
00:52:10.551 --> 00:52:11.900
<v Speaker 5>cause he liked your picture today.</v>

1865
00:52:11.901 --> 00:52:12.711
<v Speaker 5>So I was like,</v>

1866
00:52:12.711 --> 00:52:12.921
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1867
00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:13.730
<v Speaker 5>is this him?</v>

1868
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:14.250
<v Speaker 5>And I went to,</v>

1869
00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:15.620
<v Speaker 5>it's like 600 followers.</v>

1870
00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:17.090
<v Speaker 5>Maybe might not be him.</v>

1871
00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:18.450
<v Speaker 5>It might not be him.</v>

1872
00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:20.150
<v Speaker 5>I'm like 600 followers.</v>

1873
00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:21.580
<v Speaker 5>That is fake.</v>

1874
00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:21.910
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1875
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:22.430
<v Speaker 5>he's got more.</v>

1876
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:24.950
<v Speaker 5>He's a superstar in Sweden.</v>

1877
00:52:24.951 --> 00:52:25.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1878
00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:26.120
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1879
00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:27.340
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1880
00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:27.500
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1881
00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:28.333
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

1882
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.840
<v Speaker 5>when he fought in Stockholm,</v>

1883
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:31.880
<v Speaker 5>when he fought a rumble rumble Johnson,</v>

1884
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:33.970
<v Speaker 5>there's a giant crowd there.</v>

1885
00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:34.251
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1886
00:52:34.251 --> 00:52:37.370
<v Speaker 5>I want to say like 30,000 plus people that he has billboards.</v>

1887
00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.273
<v Speaker 5>Oh Gosh.</v>

1888
00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:38.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1889
00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:39.593
<v Speaker 5>He's a stud,</v>

1890
00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:41.390
<v Speaker 5>so there's no way that was a real wow.</v>

1891
00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:42.500
<v Speaker 5>It was a good fight.</v>

1892
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.470
<v Speaker 5>But Jimmy Manoa has like really nasty,</v>

1893
00:52:45.471 --> 00:52:48.290
<v Speaker 5>nasty power and stand up for mechanics.</v>

1894
00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:48.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1895
00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:52.220
<v Speaker 5>Like I find it almost hard to believe he did it and start striking until he was</v>

1896
00:52:52.221 --> 00:52:53.090
<v Speaker 5>28 years old.</v>

1897
00:52:53.091 --> 00:52:53.780
<v Speaker 5>Good athlete.</v>

1898
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:54.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1899
00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:57.110
<v Speaker 5>OSP is a better athlete and he's so hard to,</v>

1900
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:58.610
<v Speaker 5>he's like so unconventional.</v>

1901
00:52:58.611 --> 00:52:59.860
<v Speaker 5>That's why I had to give us,</v>

1902
00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:01.910
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1903
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:02.690
<v Speaker 5>that hurt.</v>

1904
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:06.350
<v Speaker 5>We have to also remember that Osp suffered a broken arm and the John Jones fight</v>

1905
00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:09.620
<v Speaker 5>and you don't know how long it took for that to heal up,</v>

1906
00:53:09.621 --> 00:53:10.670
<v Speaker 5>how it healed up.</v>

1907
00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:12.530
<v Speaker 5>Some guys will break an arm,</v>

1908
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:16.460
<v Speaker 5>like a bad examples like the Nogueira fight when Frank Mir broke Nogueira his</v>

1909
00:53:16.461 --> 00:53:20.180
<v Speaker 5>arm Nogueira's arm was pretty fucked up for a long time.</v>

1910
00:53:20.181 --> 00:53:20.631
<v Speaker 5>After that.</v>

1911
00:53:20.631 --> 00:53:24.110
<v Speaker 5>I was also 80 years old in the fight world when he broke his fucking dog in the</v>

1912
00:53:24.111 --> 00:53:24.670
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>

1913
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:26.610
<v Speaker 5>He was 80 years a tortoise</v>

1914
00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:29.493
<v Speaker 5>flight years.</v>

1915
00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.510
<v Speaker 5>It was up here.</v>

1916
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:31.870
<v Speaker 5>It was the upper is a mess.</v>

1917
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.850
<v Speaker 5>Snap to shit off of God.</v>

1918
00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:35.340
<v Speaker 5>That was ugly man.</v>

1919
00:53:35.341 --> 00:53:36.390
<v Speaker 5>We just caught him with a knee.</v>

1920
00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:37.291
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1921
00:53:37.291 --> 00:53:38.040
<v Speaker 5>he's um,</v>

1922
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:38.550
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1923
00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:41.520
<v Speaker 5>Frank Mir is a fucking bad ass submission artist.</v>

1924
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:43.770
<v Speaker 5>This OSP holding onto the head.</v>

1925
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:46.850
<v Speaker 5>This ain't good from Manoa was like a neat,</v>

1926
00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:49.300
<v Speaker 5>oh look at that and I just drops right down.</v>

1927
00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.153
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1928
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.710
<v Speaker 5>he was a beautiful going to twist him.</v>

1929
00:53:52.711 --> 00:53:54.090
<v Speaker 5>Watch beautiful wrestling.</v>

1930
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:55.890
<v Speaker 5>Mental is not exactly a grappler.</v>

1931
00:53:55.891 --> 00:53:56.071
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1932
00:53:56.071 --> 00:53:57.270
<v Speaker 5>This is smart by Ospi,</v>

1933
00:53:57.271 --> 00:53:58.104
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1934
00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:00.420
<v Speaker 5>Don't be shocked if it gets into the truck.</v>

1935
00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:04.000
<v Speaker 5>Don't be shocked if it gets into what you'll see.</v>

1936
00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:05.730
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what Osp,</v>

1937
00:54:05.731 --> 00:54:07.710
<v Speaker 5>when he fought John Jones,</v>

1938
00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:09.600
<v Speaker 5>he might've lost that fight,</v>

1939
00:54:09.601 --> 00:54:13.760
<v Speaker 5>but he showed people that he's a real world class fighter and the fact that he</v>

1940
00:54:13.761 --> 00:54:17.040
<v Speaker 5>was able to fight with a broken arm through a portion,</v>

1941
00:54:17.041 --> 00:54:19.140
<v Speaker 5>I think of the fourth and the whole fifth round.</v>

1942
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:20.341
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1943
00:54:20.341 --> 00:54:20.611
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1944
00:54:20.611 --> 00:54:21.444
<v Speaker 5>I think you've got to,</v>

1945
00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:21.931
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1946
00:54:21.931 --> 00:54:22.920
<v Speaker 5>even though he lost the fight,</v>

1947
00:54:22.921 --> 00:54:24.600
<v Speaker 5>he got a shitload of confidence from him.</v>

1948
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:25.980
<v Speaker 5>So that helps.</v>

1949
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:27.750
<v Speaker 5>John also was kind of weird,</v>

1950
00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:27.961
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1951
00:54:27.961 --> 00:54:29.010
<v Speaker 5>it was a little weird night.</v>

1952
00:54:29.011 --> 00:54:29.880
<v Speaker 5>He broke his arm.</v>

1953
00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:30.830
<v Speaker 5>John was super,</v>

1954
00:54:30.970 --> 00:54:31.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1955
00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:33.090
<v Speaker 5>and I think that see people,</v>

1956
00:54:33.091 --> 00:54:34.380
<v Speaker 5>I think given John a hard time,</v>

1957
00:54:34.381 --> 00:54:36.180
<v Speaker 5>I think John didn't feel that comfortable,</v>

1958
00:54:36.181 --> 00:54:38.970
<v Speaker 5>but I think that osps really fucking good.</v>

1959
00:54:38.971 --> 00:54:40.650
<v Speaker 5>And I think the giant had to be careful.</v>

1960
00:54:40.651 --> 00:54:40.981
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

1961
00:54:40.981 --> 00:54:44.100
<v Speaker 5>I think John had to be careful and I think John played it a little safe.</v>

1962
00:54:44.101 --> 00:54:46.350
<v Speaker 5>And I think Osp as a south dropped,</v>

1963
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:52.020
<v Speaker 5>he dropped out for the kids who are looking for the kids in our men.</v>

1964
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:54.660
<v Speaker 5>He's not going to just hold it on right now.</v>

1965
00:54:54.661 --> 00:54:54.870
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1966
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:55.620
<v Speaker 5>he might get it.</v>

1967
00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:56.131
<v Speaker 5>It's totally,</v>

1968
00:54:56.131 --> 00:54:57.060
<v Speaker 5>totally my get it.</v>

1969
00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:58.950
<v Speaker 5>You never know what's going on.</v>

1970
00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:00.570
<v Speaker 5>What's going on the right arm,</v>

1971
00:55:00.571 --> 00:55:01.890
<v Speaker 5>what's going on with it was piece of right arm.</v>

1972
00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:03.210
<v Speaker 5>He's definitely under the chin,</v>

1973
00:55:03.211 --> 00:55:03.450
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1974
00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:04.590
<v Speaker 5>I just pushing down the rest.</v>

1975
00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:05.880
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1976
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.440
<v Speaker 5>he's got some hand fight,</v>

1977
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:08.303
<v Speaker 5>some space.</v>

1978
00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:09.953
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>

1979
00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:15.300
<v Speaker 5>The back scrambles,</v>

1980
00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:18.720
<v Speaker 5>little tiny scrambles like that into the truck.</v>

1981
00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:19.700
<v Speaker 5>Hasn't got,</v>

1982
00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:23.440
<v Speaker 5>he's even got a brand on this Kennedy's he might have one.</v>

1983
00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:23.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1984
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:26.940
<v Speaker 5>At this fraternity to see Tennessee,</v>

1985
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:30.120
<v Speaker 5>one minute see manner where there was like some little space there.</v>

1986
00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.480
<v Speaker 5>There was some space to scramble and man,</v>

1987
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.961
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

1988
00:55:32.961 --> 00:55:33.571
<v Speaker 5>the rest of it.</v>

1989
00:55:33.571 --> 00:55:36.100
<v Speaker 5>Instead of scrambling at 49 seconds.</v>

1990
00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:36.871
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1991
00:55:36.871 --> 00:55:39.750
<v Speaker 5>He arrested instead of square and it wasn't a perfect spot against the fence.</v>

1992
00:55:39.751 --> 00:55:40.950
<v Speaker 5>He's turning to his left,</v>

1993
00:55:40.951 --> 00:55:41.701
<v Speaker 5>which is perfect.</v>

1994
00:55:41.701 --> 00:55:42.511
<v Speaker 5>If he turned to his ride,</v>

1995
00:55:42.511 --> 00:55:44.250
<v Speaker 5>he'd be in deep trouble.</v>

1996
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:48.570
<v Speaker 5>Bravo's where fucking elbows to the back of the head would be the king.</v>

1997
00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:49.861
<v Speaker 5>To your point,</v>

1998
00:55:49.861 --> 00:55:50.011
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

1999
00:55:50.011 --> 00:55:50.850
<v Speaker 5>when you said he rested,</v>

2000
00:55:50.851 --> 00:55:51.690
<v Speaker 5>we should have scrambled.</v>

2001
00:55:51.691 --> 00:55:53.040
<v Speaker 5>That's where the world champions don't,</v>

2002
00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:56.840
<v Speaker 5>they literally get the fuck out and change the danger of the game.</v>

2003
00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:57.930
<v Speaker 5>Like you look at,</v>

2004
00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.780
<v Speaker 5>you know like a guy like mighty mouse is a perfect example.</v>

2005
00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:01.620
<v Speaker 5>I know I always use them,</v>

2006
00:56:01.621 --> 00:56:03.120
<v Speaker 5>but they ain't getting no room there</v>

2007
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:05.783
<v Speaker 5>and she's,</v>

2008
00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:07.510
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2009
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:08.490
<v Speaker 5>let's go into it.</v>

2010
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:10.343
<v Speaker 5>I lost it.</v>

2011
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:12.150

<v Speaker 5>it's the paper.</v>

2040
00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:57.190

2072
00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:39.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm interested in see what adjustments Frankie makes from the Aldo fight now</v>

2073
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:42.220
<v Speaker 5>cause I'll go beat up a little bit.</v>

2074
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.641
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2075
00:57:42.641 --> 00:57:45.730
<v Speaker 5>I'll do a flip the script on them and you turn it into a boxing match.</v>

2076
00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:47.550
<v Speaker 5>Although flip the script on the UFC.</v>

2077
00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:47.741
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

2078
00:57:47.741 --> 00:57:47.921
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>

2079
00:57:47.921 --> 00:57:48.251
<v Speaker 5>I'm good.</v>

2080
00:57:48.251 --> 00:57:48.611
<v Speaker 5>I'm good.</v>

2081
00:57:48.611 --> 00:57:49.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm done.</v>

2082
00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:50.183
<v Speaker 5>Is he serious?</v>

2083
00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:50.920
<v Speaker 5>What is he saying?</v>

2084
00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.210
<v Speaker 5>He said he's going to play soccer.</v>

2085
00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:57.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what he wants to play some serious serious kicks here,</v>

2086
00:57:57.341 --> 00:57:57.970
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2087
00:57:57.970 --> 00:57:59.050
<v Speaker 5>Beautiful leg kicks.</v>

2088
00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:02.770
<v Speaker 5>LSPS attack at the end say oh the left hook.</v>

2089
00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:06.970
<v Speaker 5>Do you think all those being serious or do you think he's just expressing oh</v>

2090
00:58:06.971 --> 00:58:07.331
<v Speaker 5>nice.</v>

2091
00:58:07.331 --> 00:58:08.320
<v Speaker 5>Walked right into that.</v>

2092
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:12.450
<v Speaker 5>I think he's being serious for now to realize is what kind of monster he's</v>

2093
00:58:12.451 --> 00:58:12.851
<v Speaker 5>dealing with.</v>

2094
00:58:12.851 --> 00:58:14.920
<v Speaker 5>Because even though you don't like it,</v>

2095
00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:16.990
<v Speaker 5>they're never gonna let you out of your contract.</v>

2096
00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:17.351
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2097
00:58:17.351 --> 00:58:18.280
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't work that way.</v>

2098
00:58:18.281 --> 00:58:19.210
<v Speaker 5>He signed the contract.</v>

2099
00:58:19.211 --> 00:58:22.480
<v Speaker 5>Like unless you're literally legitimately going to go play another sport.</v>

2100
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2101
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:23.741
<v Speaker 5>you're done fighting.</v>

2102
00:58:23.741 --> 00:58:27.160
<v Speaker 5>If you're not going to write out your UFC contract doesn't work like that.</v>

2103
00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:27.531
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2104
00:58:27.531 --> 00:58:29.290
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's asking to fight again.</v>

2105
00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:31.420
<v Speaker 5>I think he's saying that he's going to do something else.</v>

2106
00:58:31.421 --> 00:58:33.040
<v Speaker 5>I think that's essentially what he's saying.</v>

2107
00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:34.280
<v Speaker 5>What I read,</v>

2108
00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:34.490
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2109
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:35.770
<v Speaker 5>we got spinning back for as a temp.</v>

2110
00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:37.570
<v Speaker 5>What I read is that who's going to play soccer?</v>

2111
00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:39.183
<v Speaker 5>That's him.</v>

2112
00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:41.710
<v Speaker 5>He apparently before he fought in the UFC,</v>

2113
00:58:41.711 --> 00:58:42.101
<v Speaker 5>look dude,</v>

2114

<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2116
00:58:44.381 --> 00:58:46.150
<v Speaker 5>I don't know like how he is mean.</v>

2117
00:58:46.151 --> 00:58:48.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure he's playing other good soccer charity game.</v>

2118
00:58:48.401 --> 00:58:49.420
<v Speaker 5>If we're Natto came in there,</v>

2119

<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2231
01:01:44.631 --> 01:01:45.740

2232
01:01:45.741 --> 01:01:45.921
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I thought his shit snapped off.</v>

2237
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:53.930
<v Speaker 5>He was the first guy where I realize we shouldn't be interviewing fighters after</v>

2238
01:01:53.931 --> 01:01:56.060
<v Speaker 5>they fight legit knocked out.</v>

2239
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.481
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2240
01:01:56.481 --> 01:01:57.380
<v Speaker 5>you can't be doing the same.</v>

2241
01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:57.681
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2242
01:01:57.681 --> 01:01:57.970
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

2243
01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:58.970
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't know what he's doing.</v>

2244
01:01:59.000 --> 01:01:59.860
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't even know where you are.</v>

2245
01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:03.320
<v Speaker 5>You don't know what happened and then they put a mic in your face.</v>

2246
01:02:03.330 --> 01:02:03.680
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

2247
01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.460
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

2248
01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.770
<v Speaker 5>it's totally assuming I got punched or kicked in the face.</v>

2249
01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.640
<v Speaker 5>It'd be one thing if the fight or felt fine and was willing to talk about it and</v>

2250
01:02:10.641 --> 01:02:12.680
<v Speaker 5>new and wanting to do it themselves,</v>

2251
01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:13.641
<v Speaker 5>but even then,</v>

2252
01:02:13.641 --> 01:02:14.450
<v Speaker 5>then they shouldn't.</v>

2253
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:14.931
<v Speaker 5>Even then,</v>

2254
01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:16.580
<v Speaker 5>it's probably not the best idea.</v>

2255
01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:16.760
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2256

<v Speaker 5>See his leg?</v>

2303
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:25.350
<v Speaker 5>His leg went under over and then bounced up like a cheerleader kicked.</v>

2304
01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.780
<v Speaker 5>I know what the most brutal knockout ever.</v>

2305
01:03:27.781 --> 01:03:28.710
<v Speaker 5>Ray Mercer.</v>

2306
01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:29.600
<v Speaker 5>Tommy Morris.</v>

2307
01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:29.851
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2308
01:03:29.851 --> 01:03:30.684
<v Speaker 5>you're right,</v>

2309
01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:31.140
<v Speaker 5>ray.</v>

2310
01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.250
<v Speaker 5>He got caught on the ropes.</v>

2311
01:03:32.251 --> 01:03:34.230
<v Speaker 5>So Ray Mercer kept upper cutting him.</v>

2312
01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.193
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

2313
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:38.460
<v Speaker 5>the ropes were holding his ass up that legs bad.</v>

2314
01:03:38.461 --> 01:03:41.010
<v Speaker 5>Do you see that Joe was bad and he had aids?</v>

2315
01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:42.120
<v Speaker 5>Correct?</v>

2316
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.590
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he had aids back down.</v>

2317
01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.340
<v Speaker 5>Did he was bought,</v>

2318
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.590
<v Speaker 5>you want to talk about one of the best white boy bodies of all time?</v>

2319
01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.820
<v Speaker 5>Tommy Morrison.</v>

2320
01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:51.000
<v Speaker 5>What happened later on in his career when he went crazy,</v>

2321
01:03:51.001 --> 01:03:52.020
<v Speaker 5>he got his tits done.</v>

2322
01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:52.171
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2323
01:03:52.171 --> 01:03:53.004
<v Speaker 5>he got aids.</v>

2324
01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:53.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2325
01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:53.820
<v Speaker 5>he had,</v>

2326
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:54.930
<v Speaker 5>he had breast implants.</v>

2327
01:03:54.931 --> 01:03:55.920
<v Speaker 5>Is fights and chronic.</v>

2328
01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:58.310
<v Speaker 5>Just show the human hurry.</v>

2329
01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:58.710
<v Speaker 5>Go.</v>

2330
01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:01.320
<v Speaker 5>So in the beginning Tommy was doing well,</v>

2331
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:04.380
<v Speaker 5>but then ray Mercer came on strong.</v>

2332
01:04:04.381 --> 01:04:05.280
<v Speaker 5>Here it is in the fifth round.</v>

2333
01:04:05.281 --> 01:04:05.581
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>

2334
01:04:05.581 --> 01:04:06.240
<v Speaker 5>Boom,</v>

2335
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:06.631
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>

2336
01:04:06.631 --> 01:04:06.961
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>

2337
01:04:06.961 --> 01:04:07.620
<v Speaker 5>boom.</v>

2338
01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:08.331
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

2339
01:04:08.331 --> 01:04:08.670
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

2340
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:10.590
<v Speaker 5>Oh see him tied up</v>

2341
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.990

01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:20.040
<v Speaker 5>Oh Oh balance go route.</v>

2343
01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:22.830
<v Speaker 5>That's insane.</v>

2344
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:23.910
<v Speaker 5>That is insane.</v>

2345
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:25.581
<v Speaker 5>That's insane.</v>

2346
01:04:25.581 --> 01:04:27.540
<v Speaker 5>You know Ray Mercer Kimbo slice.</v>

2347
01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:28.403
<v Speaker 5>I got to take a pee.</v>

2348
01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:29.011
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2349
01:04:29.011 --> 01:04:29.430
<v Speaker 5>buddy.</v>

2350
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:30.263
<v Speaker 5>Guillotine dumb.</v>

2351
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:30.791
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2352
01:04:30.791 --> 01:04:33.600
<v Speaker 5>it Kimbo and Ray wrote down,</v>

2353
01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:37.590
<v Speaker 5>but ray ray didn't have any grappling experience at all.</v>

2354
01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:40.170
<v Speaker 5>And Kimbo was training at American top team.</v>

2355
01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.090
<v Speaker 5>Even though Kimbo is not a grappler,</v>

2356
01:04:42.091 --> 01:04:45.330
<v Speaker 5>he was more of a grappler than ray ray probably thought it was just going to be</v>

2357
01:04:45.331 --> 01:04:46.470
<v Speaker 5>like a stand up fight.</v>

2358
01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:46.801
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

2359
01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:47.581
<v Speaker 5>it can be big.</v>

2360
01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:49.170
<v Speaker 5>We get this times square.</v>

2361
01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:49.590
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

2362
01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:50.640
<v Speaker 5>Come on saying,</v>

2363
01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:51.600
<v Speaker 5>look at this.</v>

2364
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.530
<v Speaker 5>Conor is Conor,</v>

2365
01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.860
<v Speaker 5>he's like gangster,</v>

2366
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:56.280
<v Speaker 5>like she's got Cammo on.</v>

2369
01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:00.990
<v Speaker 5>Eddie Alvarez drinking a cup of coffee.</v>

2370
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:02.583

2376
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:11.610
<v Speaker 5>I can't even hear this.</v>

2377
01:05:11.611 --> 01:05:12.780
<v Speaker 5>And it looks cool,</v>

2378
01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:13.740
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

2379
01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:14.730
<v Speaker 5>There's Carlina Cabal,</v>

2380
01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:15.361
<v Speaker 5>Tyron,</v>

2381
01:05:15.361 --> 01:05:16.290
<v Speaker 5>motherfucking Woodley,</v>

2382
01:05:16.291 --> 01:05:16.951
<v Speaker 5>ladies and gentlemen.</v>

2383
01:05:16.951 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 5>I think a bad ass right there.</v>

2384
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:19.600
<v Speaker 5>It is a fucking bad ass.</v>

2385
01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:21.670
<v Speaker 5>He's got some power too.</v>

2386
01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:23.050
<v Speaker 5>That's putting it mildly.</v>

2387
01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.400
<v Speaker 5>Nobody knocks out Robbie Lawler.</v>

2388
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:28.103
<v Speaker 5>Tyron can,</v>

2389
01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.040
<v Speaker 5>he can cover some distance to,</v>

2390
01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:30.400
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2391
01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:34.210
<v Speaker 5>he put the lights out and he's a Duke grooveless a protege.</v>

2392
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:39.510
<v Speaker 5>Duke Roufus is one of the best striking coach on the planet earth before World</v>

2393
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:41.350
<v Speaker 5>Moy Thai champion.</v>

2394
01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:45.820
<v Speaker 5>His brother Rick Rufus is another kickboxing legend like that family.</v>

2395
01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:46.750
<v Speaker 5>There's some deep,</v>

2396
01:05:46.751 --> 01:05:47.260
<v Speaker 5>deep,</v>

2397
01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:48.190
<v Speaker 5>deep knowledge.</v>

2398
01:05:48.191 --> 01:05:49.420
<v Speaker 5>And that's what tyrants training.</v>

2399
01:05:49.421 --> 01:05:50.710
<v Speaker 5>That's where he's doing all his striking.</v>

2400
01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:54.780
<v Speaker 5>So Wonderboy is probably without w mean it's,</v>

2401
01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:58.180
<v Speaker 5>it's a debate that he's the greatest striker in the UFC.</v>

2402
01:05:58.210 --> 01:05:59.710
<v Speaker 5>Ever wonder boy.</v>

2403
01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:00.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2404
01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.980
<v Speaker 5>it's a debate because he was some insane number,</v>

2405
01:06:02.981 --> 01:06:05.170
<v Speaker 5>like 57 and oh and kickbox.</v>

2406
01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:05.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2407
01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:07.480
<v Speaker 5>he only lost one time in the UFC.</v>

2408
01:06:07.481 --> 01:06:08.470
<v Speaker 5>That was to Matt Brown.</v>

2409
01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.090
<v Speaker 5>He just looks like a normal guy.</v>

2410
01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:11.860
<v Speaker 5>Does an intellect when they're showing them right there.</v>

2411
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2412
01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:14.230
<v Speaker 5>And in a very polite guy to really,</v>

2413
01:06:14.231 --> 01:06:14.800
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2414
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.633
<v Speaker 5>well spoken,</v>

2415
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:18.490
<v Speaker 5>but his kickboxing is off the chain.</v>

2416
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:20.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's a world champion.</v>

2417
01:06:20.621 --> 01:06:22.090
<v Speaker 5>Kickboxer of the likes are.</v>

2418
01:06:22.091 --> 01:06:25.780
<v Speaker 5>There's very few guys who fought in MMA like you know,</v>

2419
01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:30.180
<v Speaker 5>even Mirko Mirko was a k one Stryker and who's a bad motherfucker.</v>

2420
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:33.820
<v Speaker 5>But one of the reasons why he was so good in MMA was cause he was explosive.</v>

2421
01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:37.360
<v Speaker 5>He was really fast and he could hit really hard and quick,</v>

2422
01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:42.570
<v Speaker 5>but he wasn't like the most like s technically perfect kickboxer like Ernesto</v>

2423
01:06:43.571 --> 01:06:44.380
<v Speaker 5>hoost.</v>

2424
01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:44.981
<v Speaker 5>But Ernesto,</v>

2425
01:06:44.981 --> 01:06:45.640
<v Speaker 5>who's,</v>

2426
01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:47.790
<v Speaker 5>he would pick you apart nice and slow,</v>

2427
01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:51.460
<v Speaker 5>do it all with technique and just chop chop away at you and eventually knock you</v>

2428
01:06:51.461 --> 01:06:54.790
<v Speaker 5>out with some beautiful high kick or a perfectly placed punch or something like</v>

2429
01:06:54.791 --> 01:06:55.210
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2430
01:06:55.210 --> 01:07:00.190
<v Speaker 5>But Merkel wouldn't bark guys with like one kick and those type of guys are like</v>

2431
01:07:00.191 --> 01:07:04.150
<v Speaker 5>at a high level like Mirko was there more dangerous and MMA because haven't met</v>

2432
01:07:04.151 --> 01:07:05.410
<v Speaker 5>everything happens so fast.</v>

2433
01:07:05.411 --> 01:07:06.850
<v Speaker 5>You're saying wonder boys like that?</v>

2434
01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.370
<v Speaker 5>I think Wonderboy is super skillful.</v>

2435
01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:12.490
<v Speaker 5>He skillful in a way like when you see him fight Hendricks you realize like,</v>

2436
01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.540
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

2437
01:07:13.541 --> 01:07:17.380
<v Speaker 5>like this is so next level and he does stuff that everybody can't do.</v>

2438
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:18.970
<v Speaker 5>Like right off the front leg,</v>

2439
01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.470
<v Speaker 5>his front leg,</v>

2440
01:07:20.471 --> 01:07:24.090
<v Speaker 5>you got to get past that front leg and that's not an easy thing to do.</v>

2441
01:07:24.091 --> 01:07:25.100
<v Speaker 5>He's front leg side.</v>

2442
01:07:25.101 --> 01:07:27.760
<v Speaker 5>Cal is a salad that round Kenyan his face,</v>

2443
01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:29.650
<v Speaker 5>he could do some shit that other guys can't do.</v>

2444
01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.610
<v Speaker 5>So like you,</v>

2445
01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:30.920
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2446
01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.240
<v Speaker 5>you have a real hard time bringing in someone and training that has a front leg.</v>

2447
01:07:34.241 --> 01:07:34.891
<v Speaker 5>Like that guy.</v>

2448
01:07:34.891 --> 01:07:35.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2449
01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:36.760
<v Speaker 5>You only have like a few guys to choose from.</v>

2450
01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:38.590
<v Speaker 5>You have to take like Raymond Daniels,</v>

2451
01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.870
<v Speaker 5>you have to take someone who does Dragon Wilson.</v>

2452
01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:41.420
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

2453
01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:42.370
<v Speaker 5>Don could've done it.</v>

2454
01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:43.120
<v Speaker 5>Thrive.</v>

2455
01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:43.953
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you could still,</v>

2456
01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:46.780
<v Speaker 5>it was like then he was just on one leg just like flipping it up.</v>

2457
01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.200
<v Speaker 5>You know when Donna dragging roles,</v>

2458
01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.870
<v Speaker 5>Wilson might still be able to spar.</v>

2459
01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.510
<v Speaker 5>He's one of them that keeps training in and dipping.</v>

2460
01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:56.170
<v Speaker 5>It was like sixties and seventies if you light spar with them,</v>

2461
01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:56.820
<v Speaker 5>as long as you tried to,</v>

2462
01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:57.880
<v Speaker 5>don't try to beat him up.</v>

2463
01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:59.300
<v Speaker 5>He's a skillful motherfucker.</v>

2464
01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.630
<v Speaker 5>Tez Ronda Rousey really fighting a man in Nunez.</v>

2465
01:08:01.650 --> 01:08:02.920
<v Speaker 5>Is that real or was that a hoax?</v>

2466
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:04.690
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what she wants to do,</v>

2467
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:06.070
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think it's been set up.</v>

2468
01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:06.760
<v Speaker 5>I heard she,</v>

2469
01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.450
<v Speaker 5>I thought she wants to fight Cyborg and cyborgs said she's going eat face</v>

2470
01:08:10.451 --> 01:08:10.850
<v Speaker 5>surgery.</v>

2471
01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:11.470
<v Speaker 5>She fights it.</v>

2472
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:12.400
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what Cyborg said?</v>

2473
01:08:12.401 --> 01:08:12.790
<v Speaker 5>She said,</v>

2474
01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:15.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm like candy man to say my name and how come she thought,</v>

2475
01:08:15.951 --> 01:08:16.820
<v Speaker 5>but she scares me.</v>

2476
01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.040
<v Speaker 5>I going to be Cyborg.</v>

2477
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.920
<v Speaker 5>Cyborg is called calling around today.</v>

2478
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2479
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:23.630
<v Speaker 5>man wants to fight her so bad.</v>

2480
01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:24.081
<v Speaker 5>And then she said,</v>

2481
01:08:24.081 --> 01:08:25.220
<v Speaker 5>maybe if I was blue eyes,</v>

2482
01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:25.971
<v Speaker 5>blonde hair,</v>

2483
01:08:25.971 --> 01:08:27.140
<v Speaker 5>and you'd make a division for me,</v>

2484
01:08:27.141 --> 01:08:28.220
<v Speaker 5>give me the goddamn fight.</v>

2485
01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.113
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

2486
01:08:29.130 --> 01:08:31.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

2487
01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.010
<v Speaker 5>such a monster.</v>

2488
01:08:34.011 --> 01:08:34.521
<v Speaker 5>And you know what,</v>

2489
01:08:34.521 --> 01:08:34.701
<v Speaker 5>man?</v>

2490
01:08:34.701 --> 01:08:35.241
<v Speaker 5>Here's the deal.</v>

2491
01:08:35.241 --> 01:08:39.020
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of other women out there that fight at one 45 this idea that</v>

2492
01:08:39.021 --> 01:08:41.180
<v Speaker 5>there's no women at one 45 that's just not true.</v>

2493
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:43.790
<v Speaker 5>There's women at one 45 they just don't want to fight.</v>

2494
01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:44.631
<v Speaker 5>Nobody will.</v>

2495
01:08:44.631 --> 01:08:46.710
<v Speaker 5>Some might hurt some dude that like,</v>

2496
01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.170
<v Speaker 5>you know that money,</v>

2497
01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.790
<v Speaker 5>Lina Landsberg would just fodder.</v>

2498
01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:50.690
<v Speaker 5>She took the chance.</v>

2499
01:08:50.691 --> 01:08:51.420
<v Speaker 5>She fought her.</v>

2500
01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:52.253
<v Speaker 5>She's not,</v>

2501
01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:53.900
<v Speaker 5>she's not.</v>

2502
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:54.860
<v Speaker 5>She didn't land one punch.</v>

2503
01:08:54.861 --> 01:08:55.694
<v Speaker 5>He had to know.</v>

2504
01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:56.181
<v Speaker 5>She didn't know.</v>

2505
01:08:56.181 --> 01:08:57.290
<v Speaker 5>She had no chance.</v>

2506
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:59.810
<v Speaker 5>She took him for the world more Thai champion.</v>

2507
01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.010
<v Speaker 5>She didn't take it for the payday,</v>

2508
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:02.360
<v Speaker 5>the girl's world book,</v>

2509
01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:03.980
<v Speaker 5>anything but not really.</v>

2510
01:09:04.210 --> 01:09:04.941
<v Speaker 5>She made something.</v>

2511
01:09:04.941 --> 01:09:08.870
<v Speaker 5>She got into the UFC and know now she's in the mix and she can have a career in</v>

2512
01:09:08.871 --> 01:09:11.450
<v Speaker 5>the UFC at one 35 she did not take a chance,</v>

2513
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:12.290
<v Speaker 5>but if she won,</v>

2514
01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.300
<v Speaker 5>it's a giant chance and if you win,</v>

2515
01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.710
<v Speaker 5>you're a fucking superhero.</v>

2516
01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:21.100
<v Speaker 5>There's no one right now that would give her an issue in the UFC.</v>

2517
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.341
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2518
01:09:22.341 --> 01:09:26.810
<v Speaker 5>here's my ask to ask Holly with her fighting style would fight her at one 30</v>

2519
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:28.580
<v Speaker 5>here's another example,</v>

2520
01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.580
<v Speaker 5>Joanna Barsh.</v>

2521
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:34.010
<v Speaker 5>If Dorina bars has been training MMA and she decided to come over to MMA,</v>

2522
01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:37.250
<v Speaker 5>you want to talk about a nasty kickboxer?</v>

2523
01:09:37.570 --> 01:09:37.791
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

2524
01:09:37.791 --> 01:09:39.650
<v Speaker 5>I mean she's got some insane record.</v>

2525
01:09:39.651 --> 01:09:41.250
<v Speaker 5>I think she's like 38 Oh shit.</v>

2526
01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.780
<v Speaker 5>No one wanted to fight her for years.</v>

2527
01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.260
<v Speaker 5>She beat the shit out of her.</v>

2528
01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:45.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2529
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:46.723
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2530
01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:47.770
<v Speaker 5>she's gangster.</v>

2531
01:09:47.830 --> 01:09:48.250
<v Speaker 5>She's at,</v>

2532
01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:50.110
<v Speaker 5>she's tall decision.</v>

2533
01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:52.220
<v Speaker 5>She went by decision but then remember knocked her down.</v>

2534
01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:55.100
<v Speaker 5>She talking about doing MMA.</v>

2535
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:55.971
<v Speaker 5>If she did,</v>

2536
01:09:55.971 --> 01:10:00.971
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying that's the kind of seven need to challenge that takes her down so she</v>

2537
01:10:01.371 --> 01:10:02.310
<v Speaker 5>can't keep her off her.</v>

2538
01:10:02.610 --> 01:10:03.200
<v Speaker 5>She might,</v>

2539
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.001
<v Speaker 5>she has a lot.</v>

2540
01:10:04.001 --> 01:10:05.600
<v Speaker 5>That's the other thing people forget about Cyborg.</v>

2541
01:10:05.610 --> 01:10:07.580
<v Speaker 5>Just she's a black belt on the ground,</v>

2542
01:10:07.581 --> 01:10:08.840
<v Speaker 5>legit black,</v>

2543
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:10.820
<v Speaker 5>worried about that.</v>

2544
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:11.400
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2545
01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.860
<v Speaker 5>Now go to the ground with her.</v>

2546
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:15.020
<v Speaker 5>Totally true if she can take her down,</v>

2547
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:19.430
<v Speaker 5>but in MMA you also have to realize that bars is fighting with smaller gloves.</v>

2548
01:10:19.730 --> 01:10:20.300
<v Speaker 5>She can,</v>

2549
01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:24.200
<v Speaker 5>she can land shots that are likely going to have more impact with a smaller</v>

2550
01:10:24.201 --> 01:10:24.471
<v Speaker 5>gloves.</v>

2551
01:10:24.471 --> 01:10:27.020
<v Speaker 5>You can also break your hand easier and she could get taken down.</v>

2552
01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:27.500
<v Speaker 5>She's,</v>

2553
01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.520
<v Speaker 5>she's a bad app site.</v>

2554
01:10:28.521 --> 01:10:28.970
<v Speaker 5>The same way.</v>

2555
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:31.490
<v Speaker 5>Did you see this fire TV?</v>

2556
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:33.500
<v Speaker 5>The bars is no fucking joke.</v>

2557
01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:34.280
<v Speaker 5>Look at that knee.</v>

2558
01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:34.941
<v Speaker 5>I got to step in.</v>

2559
01:10:34.941 --> 01:10:35.541
<v Speaker 5>Neat Dude.</v>

2560
01:10:35.541 --> 01:10:38.720
<v Speaker 5>She's no joke whether there's a front kick to the face.</v>

2561
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:41.270
<v Speaker 5>I chose Cyborg swarms or you know,</v>

2562
01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:41.630
<v Speaker 5>cyber.</v>

2563
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:43.090
<v Speaker 5>She's all she can handle.</v>

2564
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2565
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:46.520
<v Speaker 5>She didn't make it easy and also remember Cyborg and look at that.</v>

2566
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:47.170
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

2567
01:10:47.170 --> 01:10:47.691
<v Speaker 5>I see this.</v>

2568
01:10:47.691 --> 01:10:48.471
<v Speaker 5>I go Jesus Christ.</v>

2569
01:10:48.471 --> 01:10:49.680
<v Speaker 5>Cyborg has a chin too.</v>

2570
01:10:50.610 --> 01:10:52.310
<v Speaker 5>Damn crazy.</v>

2571
01:10:52.311 --> 01:10:53.144
<v Speaker 5>Show game.</v>

2572
01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.080
<v Speaker 5>See if you Jamie,</v>

2573
01:10:54.081 --> 01:10:56.600
<v Speaker 5>see if he could see the front kick to the face that she landed.</v>

2574
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:59.980
<v Speaker 5>She landed like a teabag kick to the face early in the fight and dropped her.</v>

2575
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:02.250
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what you do with,</v>

2576
01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:03.440
<v Speaker 5>so I don't know who's going to find,</v>

2577
01:11:03.441 --> 01:11:04.274
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2578
01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:05.720
<v Speaker 5>It's going to step up and fight her.</v>

2579
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:06.410
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing.</v>

2580
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:07.760
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wanted to fight bars.</v>

2581
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:09.250
<v Speaker 5>She's not even a kickboxer.</v>

2582
01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.830
<v Speaker 5>She's an MMA fighter and she chose to fight her in her sport.</v>

2583
01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 5>That's how game she is,</v>

2584
01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.420
<v Speaker 5>but she still made it to decision.</v>

2585
01:11:15.421 --> 01:11:18.960
<v Speaker 5>How big would that fiby her and Rhonda Cyborg and race?</v>

2586
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:22.590
<v Speaker 5>It'd be the biggest fight like crazy because they could make that happen.</v>

2587
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:23.880
<v Speaker 5>I heard,</v>

2588
01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.800
<v Speaker 5>I read the Rhonda is training hard?</v>

2589
01:11:25.801 --> 01:11:26.550
<v Speaker 5>Is that true?</v>

2590
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:27.480
<v Speaker 5>That's what I heard too.</v>

2591
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:28.343
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2592
01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:29.460
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2593
01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:29.851
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2594
01:11:29.851 --> 01:11:33.750
<v Speaker 5>I mean the only way to know is to talk to someone who is training with her and</v>

2595
01:11:33.751 --> 01:11:34.620
<v Speaker 5>then you have to trust them.</v>

2596
01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:35.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2597
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.090
<v Speaker 5>You have to go watch her train.</v>

2598
01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:36.660
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2599
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.020
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2600
01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:37.740
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2601
01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:38.180
<v Speaker 5>God.</v>

2602
01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:40.350
<v Speaker 5>I'd love to see her come back at the top of her game.</v>

2603
01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:40.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2604
01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:42.510
<v Speaker 5>You know what was such a draw?</v>

2605
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:45.000
<v Speaker 5>Amanda Nunez is fucking terrifying.</v>

2606
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2607
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:48.060
<v Speaker 5>She's got ridiculous power in her hands.</v>

2608
01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:48.330
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

2609
01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:51.240
<v Speaker 5>she punches with snapping Chris Punches,</v>

2610
01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:53.160
<v Speaker 5>but you could see like we should take was like,</v>

2611
01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:54.120
<v Speaker 5>oh shit out.</v>

2612
01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:54.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2613
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:55.590
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

2614
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:56.610
<v Speaker 5>She landed one and me.</v>

2615
01:11:56.611 --> 01:11:57.444
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>

2616
01:11:58.300 --> 01:11:59.133
<v Speaker 5>I'm not good.</v>

2617
01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:00.030
<v Speaker 5>Look at that knee.</v>

2618
01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:00.580
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>

2619
01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:02.070
<v Speaker 5>That beautiful step in knee.</v>

2620
01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.073
<v Speaker 5>Look at that man.</v>

2621
01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:04.861
<v Speaker 5>No Damn.</v>

2622
01:12:04.861 --> 01:12:07.230
<v Speaker 5>She's nasty bars is no joke,</v>

2623
01:12:07.231 --> 01:12:07.830
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

2624
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:10.770
<v Speaker 5>It was the land landed the right hand.</v>

2625
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:13.230
<v Speaker 5>It was a scrap boom.</v>

2626
01:12:13.290 --> 01:12:15.840
<v Speaker 5>So imagine that punch with light with small gloves.</v>

2627
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:16.171
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2628
01:12:16.171 --> 01:12:16.470
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

2629
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.771
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>

2630
01:12:16.771 --> 01:12:17.371
<v Speaker 5>Superman Punch.</v>

2631
01:12:17.371 --> 01:12:18.990
<v Speaker 5>Cyborg landed Cyborg.</v>

2632
01:12:18.991 --> 01:12:20.010
<v Speaker 5>So gangster dude,</v>

2633
01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:22.150
<v Speaker 5>she's so goddamn tough.</v>

2634
01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:23.390
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

2635
01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:24.930
<v Speaker 5>I just don't see anyone being there.</v>

2636
01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.130
<v Speaker 5>I think Dan,</v>

2637
01:12:26.131 --> 01:12:27.240
<v Speaker 5>what a crazy fight that was.</v>

2638
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:29.550
<v Speaker 5>I think if she's landing those with four ounce gloves,</v>

2639
01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.593
<v Speaker 5>who knows?</v>

2640
01:12:30.810 --> 01:12:31.643
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>

2641
01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:33.750
<v Speaker 5>But if bars lands with four ounce gloves,</v>

2642
01:12:33.751 --> 01:12:34.710
<v Speaker 5>this is the same thing.</v>

2643
01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:36.480
<v Speaker 5>She was hurting her there with shots too,</v>

2644
01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:38.100
<v Speaker 5>but it was a knees that was hurting her.</v>

2645
01:12:38.101 --> 01:12:38.551
<v Speaker 5>It was all,</v>

2646
01:12:38.551 --> 01:12:39.570
<v Speaker 5>mostly it was everything.</v>

2647
01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:41.390
<v Speaker 5>She hit her with a lot of heart jabs too.</v>

2648
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:42.041
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

2649
01:12:42.041 --> 01:12:45.330
<v Speaker 5>let's see what he totally Jodi Goodwin say they reinflated them.</v>

2650
01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:46.150
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

2651
01:12:46.150 --> 01:12:47.550
<v Speaker 5>well he didn't look that bad.</v>

2652
01:12:47.551 --> 01:12:48.330
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2653
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:50.920
<v Speaker 5>The best he's looked since the has got extra around that.</v>

2654
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:52.320
<v Speaker 5>That's the golden stitch came in.</v>

2655
01:12:52.321 --> 01:12:53.154
<v Speaker 5>You're bullied and debates.</v>

2656
01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.590
<v Speaker 5>She called finance the golden snitch.</v>

2657
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.780
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

2658
01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.460
<v Speaker 5>there's no traps like the old veep.</v>

2659
01:12:59.461 --> 01:12:59.820

2661
01:13:00.301 --> 01:13:01.170
<v Speaker 5>But you know what?</v>

2662
01:13:01.171 --> 01:13:03.870
<v Speaker 5>The old Vituro fought at a bunch of different weight classes.</v>

2663
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:05.100
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2664
01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:07.890
<v Speaker 5>the old Vito from TRT days was one 85 are though,</v>

2665
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:11.250
<v Speaker 5>until you got to a point or the most dangerous guy in the world when he was on</v>

2666
01:13:11.251 --> 01:13:12.570
<v Speaker 5>tot someone spinning,</v>

2667

2669
01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:17.911
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2670
01:13:17.911 --> 01:13:18.744
<v Speaker 5>he was terrified.</v>

2671
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.741
<v Speaker 5>He's no joke.</v>

2672
01:13:22.741 --> 01:13:27.130
<v Speaker 5>The scary thing is he has the skills to back all that up and he's lightening</v>

2673
01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:27.983
<v Speaker 5>fast.</v>

2674

<v Speaker 5>38 now.</v>

2675
01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:30.570
<v Speaker 5>He's definitely,</v>

2676
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:32.100
<v Speaker 5>he's definitely not in his prime.</v>

2677
01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:35.760
<v Speaker 5>He was the first Brazilian to come out with like legit box and finally a</v>

2678
01:13:35.761 --> 01:13:37.350
<v Speaker 5>Brazilian with boxing shit.</v>

2679
01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.240
<v Speaker 5>He came out and look at them.</v>

2680
01:13:39.241 --> 01:13:40.410
<v Speaker 5>They're looking at their,</v>

01:13:42.271 --> 01:13:43.410
<v Speaker 5>It's a crazy difference.</v>

2684
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:46.740
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing that I'm critical weight and that's the same weight,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

2688
01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:49.920
<v Speaker 5>Chris Weidman had a good point though.</v>

2689
01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:50.881
<v Speaker 5>He said that,</v>

<v Speaker 5>He did it to somebody else.</v>

2730
01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.760
<v Speaker 5>Do you hope to be triangle?</v>

2731
01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:42.250
<v Speaker 5>I remember he didn't try.</v>

2732
01:14:42.251 --> 01:14:43.820
<v Speaker 5>I thought he'd knocked him out and drop gray.</v>

2733
01:14:43.821 --> 01:14:46.510
<v Speaker 5>Filmed or maybe just not think he just came and got off of them,</v>

2734
01:14:46.511 --> 01:14:47.344
<v Speaker 5>but I think he did that.</v>

2735
01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:48.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to,</v>

2736
01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:48.841
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2737
01:14:48.841 --> 01:14:51.790
<v Speaker 5>I think he did that to somebody else where he makes here to triangle them.</v>

2738
01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:52.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2739
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:53.980
<v Speaker 5>Just for old time's sake.</v>

2740
01:14:53.981 --> 01:14:54.980
<v Speaker 5>When you like to see via tour,</v>

2741
01:14:54.981 --> 01:14:56.500
<v Speaker 5>when you are your campaigns,</v>

2742
01:14:56.501 --> 01:14:58.410
<v Speaker 5>you're one of those guys who wants to see a guy win.</v>

2743
01:14:59.830 --> 01:15:01.870
<v Speaker 5>We don't win with this very rare rooting here.</v>

2744
01:15:01.871 --> 01:15:05.380
<v Speaker 5>Like of course Eddie Bravo would be rooting for Tony Ferguson when Ferguson</v>

2745
01:15:05.381 --> 01:15:07.600
<v Speaker 5>fight it because it's his boy,</v>

2746
01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.900
<v Speaker 5>but for the most part we watch these fights like people I know.</v>

2747
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:12.760
<v Speaker 5>I know for sure.</v>

2748
01:15:12.761 --> 01:15:14.720
<v Speaker 5>I've known him for a long time and I've known gay God.</v>

2749
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:16.000
<v Speaker 5>I like both these guys.</v>

2750
01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:17.290

<v Speaker 5>There's no going back.</v>

2788
01:15:56.891 --> 01:15:57.970
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing with gay guard.</v>

2789
01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.950
<v Speaker 5>Gate guards got to be real careful of the blitz.</v>

<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

2799
01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:13.150
<v Speaker 5>there might be an attitude that some fighters have that v tour without the TRT</v>

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:59.450
<v Speaker 5>I did a training st coaches saying tell me insane.</v>

2874
01:17:59.451 --> 01:18:00.284
<v Speaker 5>Talked to me.</v>

2875
01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.151
<v Speaker 5>He just a,</v>

2876
01:18:01.151 --> 01:18:01.341
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2877
01:18:01.341 --> 01:18:01.640
<v Speaker 5>it's all,</v>

2878
01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.760
<v Speaker 5>he's the first guy that I really knew who did like a super camp,</v>

2879
01:18:04.761 --> 01:18:05.990
<v Speaker 5>which it's just about him.</v>

2880
01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:07.940
<v Speaker 5>Like he brought any specific training partners,</v>

2881
01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:11.510
<v Speaker 5>brown GSP named my car myself when he's fighting Anthony Johnson,</v>

2882
01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:13.520
<v Speaker 5>he brought in just this core group of guys,</v>

2883
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:14.600
<v Speaker 5>no shows for him.</v>

2884
01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:15.950
<v Speaker 5>And then he'd have his Jujitsu coach,</v>

2885
01:18:15.951 --> 01:18:16.790
<v Speaker 5>they're wrestling coach,</v>

2886
01:18:16.791 --> 01:18:18.200
<v Speaker 5>striking coach all times,</v>

2887
01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:19.430
<v Speaker 5>which I was a good fight.</v>

2888
01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:23.750
<v Speaker 5>They just disbar with them are grappling Anthony Johnson when he choked out</v>

2889
01:18:23.751 --> 01:18:25.500
<v Speaker 5>Anthony Johnson at once 70 no,</v>

2890
01:18:25.501 --> 01:18:28.100
<v Speaker 5>it was one 81 85 and 90 Johnson didn't make weight.</v>

2891
01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:28.670
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2892
01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:29.630
<v Speaker 5>That was in Brazil.</v>

2893
01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:29.991
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

2894
01:18:29.991 --> 01:18:30.250
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2895
01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:34.370
<v Speaker 5>and Johnson puts a storm on them and the first round that rumble storm and he</v>

2896
01:18:34.371 --> 01:18:37.580
<v Speaker 5>survived the storm and it was a big fight for Vituro because you overcame</v>

2897
01:18:37.581 --> 01:18:38.120
<v Speaker 5>adversity.</v>

2898
01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:38.953
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

2899
01:18:38.970 --> 01:18:40.370
<v Speaker 5>Trouble after that storm.</v>

2900
01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:40.581
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2901
01:18:40.581 --> 01:18:41.021
<v Speaker 5>And then he choked.</v>

2902
01:18:41.021 --> 01:18:41.854
<v Speaker 5>Rumba has done,</v>

2903
01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:42.800
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2904
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.520
<v Speaker 5>because gas back to anyways because he was losing way too much weight.</v>

2905
01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:48.470
<v Speaker 5>The rumble of today is different.</v>

2906
01:18:48.471 --> 01:18:51.290
<v Speaker 5>Like if you watched the rumble of today when he fought Phil Davis,</v>

2907
01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.160
<v Speaker 5>he went three heart beat Phil Davis up.</v>

2908
01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:55.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2909
01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:56.840
<v Speaker 5>It's different rumble.</v>

2910
01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:57.740
<v Speaker 5>It's two different rubber.</v>

2911
01:18:57.741 --> 01:18:58.100
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

2912
01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.720
<v Speaker 5>Wayne when he's at two oh five.</v>

2913
01:18:59.810 --> 01:19:01.030
<v Speaker 5>But Dan,</v>

2914
01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:03.710
<v Speaker 5>if you want to like make that argument,</v>

2915
01:19:03.711 --> 01:19:07.190
<v Speaker 5>Daniel Cormier was able to weather the storm and he grounded them out and then</v>

2916
01:19:07.191 --> 01:19:08.060
<v Speaker 5>he choked him out.</v>

2917
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:09.380
<v Speaker 5>But he,</v>

2918
01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:10.213
<v Speaker 5>that's a fight I was saying.</v>

2919
01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:10.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2920
01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:11.420
<v Speaker 5>he sad,</v>

2921
01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:12.253
<v Speaker 5>he sucked him dry.</v>

2922
01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:15.890
<v Speaker 5>But you have to also realize them dry gives me so I'm not in that way.</v>

2923
01:19:15.891 --> 01:19:16.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean like his energy.</v>

2924
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:17.803
<v Speaker 5>How dare you.</v>

2925
01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:18.733
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

2926
01:19:19.950 --> 01:19:20.783
<v Speaker 5>Nor,</v>

2927
01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:22.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry it was dry.</v>

2928
01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:23.923
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2929
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:26.743
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't either.</v>

2930
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:28.550
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking in terms of like,</v>

2931
01:19:28.551 --> 01:19:28.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2932
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:30.110
<v Speaker 5>like almost like a spider.</v>

2933
01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:30.321
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2934
01:19:30.321 --> 01:19:31.800
<v Speaker 5>Do you see a Sucky d?</v>

2935
01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:34.340
<v Speaker 5>DC is such old grinder,</v>

2936
01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:35.480
<v Speaker 5>you know like he wears that shirt,</v>

2937
01:19:35.481 --> 01:19:36.314
<v Speaker 5>the king of the grind.</v>

2938
01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:37.300
<v Speaker 5>That shit breaks the ground.</v>

2939
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:37.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2940
01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:38.553
<v Speaker 5>Embraces no,</v>

2941
01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:39.670
<v Speaker 5>he is a king of the grind show.</v>

2942
01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:40.630
<v Speaker 5>Embrace the no,</v>

2943
01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:41.630
<v Speaker 5>embrace the grind.</v>

2944
01:19:41.631 --> 01:19:44.930
<v Speaker 5>Everybody know that Stacy's thing but doesn't he have a shirt that says king of</v>

2945
01:19:44.931 --> 01:19:45.764
<v Speaker 5>the grind?</v>

2946
01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:46.280
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

2947
01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:47.113
<v Speaker 5>Is it,</v>

2948
01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:48.370
<v Speaker 5>why do I think he had he had,</v>

2949
01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:49.820
<v Speaker 5>he had though is embrace the grind.</v>

2950
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:50.570
<v Speaker 5>Definitely that's,</v>

2951
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:52.370
<v Speaker 5>that's a wrestling statement but that's,</v>

2952
01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.840
<v Speaker 5>he thought God</v>

2953
01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:56.780
<v Speaker 5>they'll want to again,</v>

2954
01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:58.100
<v Speaker 5>he had the king of the grind too.</v>

2955
01:19:58.101 --> 01:19:58.940
<v Speaker 5>I might be mistaken.</v>

2956
01:19:58.960 --> 01:19:59.793
<v Speaker 5>I mean you to be right.</v>

2957
01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:00.740
<v Speaker 5>Oh that can't be done.</v>

2958
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:01.603
<v Speaker 5>There it is.</v>

2959
01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:02.533
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

2960
01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:04.670
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was mistaken but anyway,</v>

2961
01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:06.113
<v Speaker 5>Brendan,</v>

2962
01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:10.500
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't sure but he does both.</v>

2963
01:20:10.501 --> 01:20:13.460
<v Speaker 5>He wears embraced the grunge short cage fighter and then you would still need of</v>

2964
01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:18.390
<v Speaker 5>the body by Louise Hasi but what my point was would that DC was able to front</v>

2965
01:20:18.391 --> 01:20:19.200
<v Speaker 5>and back.</v>

2966
01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:19.900
<v Speaker 5>You got them both.</v>

2967
01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:20.733
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2968
01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:21.031
<v Speaker 5>both.</v>

2969
01:20:21.031 --> 01:20:21.300
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2970
01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:21.960
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2971
01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:25.350
<v Speaker 5>My point was that DC was able to drain Johnson.</v>

2972
01:20:25.351 --> 01:20:25.690
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

2973
01:20:25.690 --> 01:20:29.340
<v Speaker 5>he eventually got him to the point where you could tell rumble was braking and</v>

2974
01:20:29.341 --> 01:20:30.031
<v Speaker 5>he was going to crack.</v>

2975
01:20:30.031 --> 01:20:30.780
<v Speaker 5>He broke as well.</v>

2976
01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:31.351
<v Speaker 5>He broke as well.</v>

2977
01:20:31.351 --> 01:20:31.681
<v Speaker 5>He did.</v>

2978
01:20:31.681 --> 01:20:32.310
<v Speaker 5>He just kind of,</v>

2979
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:33.180
<v Speaker 5>he gave him his neck,</v>

2980
01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:33.670
<v Speaker 5>didn't he?</v>

2981
01:20:33.670 --> 01:20:34.503
<v Speaker 5>Toward it.</v>

2982
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:38.070
<v Speaker 5>But the thing is he was training for Jon Jones was most likely going to strike</v>

2983
01:20:38.071 --> 01:20:40.320
<v Speaker 5>with them and instead he got Daniel Cormier.</v>

2984
01:20:40.330 --> 01:20:43.380
<v Speaker 5>I one of the best wrestlers to ever fucking do it in MMA.</v>

2985
01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:47.580
<v Speaker 5>I mean not the best and amendment world class.</v>

2986
01:20:47.581 --> 01:20:48.780
<v Speaker 5>Just don't see what's resume.</v>

2987
01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.310
<v Speaker 5>You've got to watch him when he fights.</v>

2988
01:20:50.311 --> 01:20:52.740
<v Speaker 5>Josh Barnett to appreciate how fucking good his Ross,</v>

2989
01:20:52.741 --> 01:20:56.550
<v Speaker 5>Josh didn't break his hand that fight though early on sort of Daniel Daniel</v>

2990
01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:57.810
<v Speaker 5>broke his hand too and he did.</v>

2991
01:20:57.811 --> 01:21:01.500
<v Speaker 5>Molly welcome scoops him up in the air and throws him to the ground.</v>

2992
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:05.280
<v Speaker 5>And this is a heavyweight Barnett who was the youngest UFC heavyweight champion</v>

2993
01:21:05.281 --> 01:21:05.521
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>

2994
01:21:05.521 --> 01:21:07.460
<v Speaker 5>And Daniel Cormier hoists him.</v>

2995
01:21:07.461 --> 01:21:12.300
<v Speaker 5>I only 60 white and just fucking throws him on the ground.</v>

2996
01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:17.301
<v Speaker 5>When you realize like watching the shifts and he does it off this power single.</v>

2997
01:21:17.551 --> 01:21:18.120
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>

2998
01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.320
<v Speaker 5>Watch how he hoists him up here.</v>

2999
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:20.183
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>

3000
01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:21.630
<v Speaker 5>Come on son.</v>

3001
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:25.590
<v Speaker 5>That's how Columbia and bloody remember what he did to Dan Henderson.</v>

3002
01:21:25.591 --> 01:21:28.520
<v Speaker 5>He did the exact same move to den Huston but literally like</v>

3003
01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:32.750
<v Speaker 5>WWF and little hints.</v>

3004
01:21:32.751 --> 01:21:33.780
<v Speaker 5>A little like a little kid.</v>

3005
01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:38.820
<v Speaker 5>Now that is some serious world class throwing ability and the Henderson fight,</v>

3006
01:21:40.081 --> 01:21:41.520
<v Speaker 5>he did that about 10 times.</v>

3007
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:43.490
<v Speaker 5>That's how God does tough Dan Harris.</v>

3008
01:21:43.491 --> 01:21:45.180
<v Speaker 5>It is running around like a rag doll.</v>

3009
01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:49.530
<v Speaker 5>This is a clear difference in size and horsepower and wrestling ability.</v>

3010
01:21:49.531 --> 01:21:51.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean all of their crowd beat the shit out of them.</v>

3011
01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:54.870
<v Speaker 5>Beat the brakes off of him for three rounds and also the guys at that level,</v>

3012
01:21:54.871 --> 01:21:55.651
<v Speaker 5>he's choked him out.</v>

3013
01:21:55.651 --> 01:21:55.980
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3159
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:01.440
<v Speaker 5>That's a big win.</v>

01:26:05.630 --> 01:26:06.090
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3165
01:26:06.090 --> 01:26:07.390
<v Speaker 5>Dan Harrison stopped down.</v>

3166
01:26:07.410 --> 01:26:08.420
<v Speaker 5>Henderson the first round.</v>

3167
01:26:08.421 --> 01:26:10.000
<v Speaker 5>That was a little bit ago.</v>

3168
01:26:10.530 --> 01:26:11.570
<v Speaker 5>It was while ago,</v>

3169
01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:12.560
<v Speaker 5>I think it was two years ago.</v>

3170
01:26:12.610 --> 01:26:15.650
<v Speaker 5>And they send the golden snitch said you want to do what he,</v>

01:26:15.651 --> 01:26:18.710
<v Speaker 5>that was a last TRT fight.</v>

3172
01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:21.170

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3175
01:26:23.150 --> 01:26:27.200
<v Speaker 5>I think it was post TRT stopped him in the first round again.</v>

3176
01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:27.860
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

3177
01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:30.370
<v Speaker 5>He stopped him one time when he was scary.</v>

3178
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:33.980
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] they fought a few times and the Henderson beat him.</v>

3179
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:36.980
<v Speaker 5>Henderson beat him by decision and pride then scary.</v>

3180
01:26:36.981 --> 01:26:41.981
<v Speaker 5>Trt v Two r stopped Henderson in the first round and then non Trt v tore stopped</v>

<v Speaker 5>He did that for the money.</v>

3265
01:29:07.321 --> 01:29:08.154

3268
01:29:09.771 --> 01:29:14.630
<v Speaker 5>the real fight is right now because Canelo has never been better and then the</v>

3269
01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:15.421
<v Speaker 5>cause they can fight.</v>

01:36:35.601 --> 01:36:38.450
<v Speaker 5>He needs to fight that dude or tease out of Cuba.</v>

3592

<v Speaker 5>No one's fight him.</v>

3593
01:36:39.231 --> 01:36:39.820

<v Speaker 5>Jack,</v>

3610
01:37:08.130 --> 01:37:10.130
<v Speaker 5>he looks like he's out of Mike Tyson's punch out.</v>

01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:11.443
<v Speaker 5>Well he's,</v>

3623
01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:29.030
<v Speaker 5>No one wants to fight him cause he's older.</v>

3624
01:37:29.031 --> 01:37:29.631
<v Speaker 5>He's from Cuba.</v>

3625
01:37:29.631 --> 01:37:33.520
<v Speaker 5>They can't really get a read on him without that Cuban team man.</v>

3626
01:37:33.521 --> 01:37:37.670
<v Speaker 5>That the level of technique that the Cuban boxing team and the Cuban judo team,</v>

3627
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:38.150
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

3628
01:37:38.150 --> 01:37:41.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean you remember how God damn good Hector Lombard's judo is.</v>

3629
01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:42.141
<v Speaker 5>People forget that.</v>

3630
01:37:42.141 --> 01:37:44.000
<v Speaker 5>Hector lumbar rag doll.</v>

3631
01:37:44.001 --> 01:37:44.870
<v Speaker 5>Jake shields.</v>

3632
01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:46.100
<v Speaker 5>Remember that fight?</v>

3633
01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:46.761
<v Speaker 5>That's when I was like,</v>

3634
01:37:46.761 --> 01:37:46.851
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3635
01:37:46.851 --> 01:37:48.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going Vegan Egg.</v>

3636
01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:48.951
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3637
01:37:48.951 --> 01:37:49.784
<v Speaker 5>how dare you.</v>

3638
01:37:50.170 --> 01:37:51.770
<v Speaker 5>You watch that one's a meat eater.</v>

3639
01:37:52.250 --> 01:37:55.580
<v Speaker 5>He hereon eats tags.</v>

3640
01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

3641
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:56.880
<v Speaker 2>think he's a vegetarian.</v>

3642
01:37:56.910 --> 01:37:57.510
<v Speaker 2>Either way.</v>

3643
01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:58.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm not done.</v>

3644
01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:02.910
<v Speaker 2>Jake shields is better than ever now and then has grabbed submitted Leo Machida</v>

3645
01:38:02.930 --> 01:38:03.763
<v Speaker 2>son,</v>

3646
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:09.030
<v Speaker 2>he's getting people forget he beat Damien Maia veteran benefit.</v>

3647
01:38:09.150 --> 01:38:11.310
<v Speaker 2>Most in my experience,</v>

3648
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.700
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

3649
01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:12.990
<v Speaker 2>I dunno if I should say most,</v>

3650
01:38:12.991 --> 01:38:17.991
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of MMA fighters as soon as they hit the UFC just seems like they're</v>

3651
01:38:20.101 --> 01:38:23.850
<v Speaker 2>grappling just maintains you don't see visible improvements.</v>

3652
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

3653
01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Game in mind.</v>

3654
01:38:26.370 --> 01:38:27.150
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3655
01:38:27.150 --> 01:38:28.530
<v Speaker 2>That's an exception but people sure.</v>

3656
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:30.220
<v Speaker 2>But you know whether it's right or wrong,</v>

3657
01:38:30.221 --> 01:38:31.710
<v Speaker 2>like people don't like watching it.</v>

3658
01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:34.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't like watching what Maya,</v>

3659
01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:35.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean the the casual fan,</v>

3660
01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:37.280
<v Speaker 2>don't they like the knockouts?</v>

3661
01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:38.970
<v Speaker 2>They like it all.</v>

3662
01:38:39.610 --> 01:38:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3663
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3664
01:38:40.510 --> 01:38:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean I liked it cause he's so impressive there but just like the knockouts,</v>

3665
01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:45.720
<v Speaker 2>he just wants kickboxing.</v>

3666
01:38:45.721 --> 01:38:46.710
<v Speaker 2>We have to any of that shit,</v>

3667
01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:49.150
<v Speaker 2>plenty of that.</v>

3668
01:38:49.150 --> 01:38:51.720
<v Speaker 2>We always had that a boxing stay there.</v>

3669
01:38:51.810 --> 01:38:55.500
<v Speaker 2>I just know sometimes when you listen to the crowd saying you,</v>

3670
01:38:55.530 --> 01:38:57.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying no,</v>

3671
01:38:58.970 --> 01:38:59.760
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

3672
01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:00.031
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3673
01:39:00.031 --> 01:39:02.040
<v Speaker 2>but people are on the ground too long.</v>

3674
01:39:02.041 --> 01:39:02.370
<v Speaker 2>He's here,</v>

3675
01:39:02.370 --> 01:39:03.660
<v Speaker 2>the crowd booing and stuff.</v>

3676
01:39:03.690 --> 01:39:04.151
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3677
01:39:04.151 --> 01:39:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Like in Alabama?</v>

3678
01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:06.983
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3679
01:39:11.930 --> 01:39:13.940
<v Speaker 2>that's Orange County Shit.</v>

3680
01:39:13.950 --> 01:39:15.070
<v Speaker 2>I got booed like a mother.</v>

3681
01:39:15.230 --> 01:39:18.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like a hundred thousand Jitsu school down there.</v>

3682
01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:21.990
<v Speaker 2>People appreciate good grappling.</v>

3683
01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:22.381
<v Speaker 2>They did.</v>

3684
01:39:22.381 --> 01:39:27.060
<v Speaker 2>The fact that Damien Maia brings that character and when when you're having him</v>

3685
01:39:27.061 --> 01:39:27.781
<v Speaker 2>against anybody,</v>

3686
01:39:27.781 --> 01:39:28.480
<v Speaker 2>any striker,</v>

3687
01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:33.120
<v Speaker 2>whoever it is at one 70 are they going to be able to stop?</v>

3688
01:39:33.150 --> 01:39:34.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a chess match,</v>

3689
01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:39.030
<v Speaker 2>not I get it strangled like a wild animal gets it.</v>

3690
01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:41.460
<v Speaker 2>He was just saying he doesn't want to see that bullshit.</v>

3691
01:39:45.010 --> 01:39:47.010
<v Speaker 2>People want to strangle.</v>

3692
01:39:48.050 --> 01:39:48.721
<v Speaker 2>When I shut it,</v>

3693
01:39:48.721 --> 01:39:49.520
<v Speaker 2>who has taught me,</v>

3694
01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:49.861
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3695
01:39:49.861 --> 01:39:50.694
<v Speaker 2>fuck</v>

3696
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3697
01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:56.120
<v Speaker 5>people like both things.</v>

3698
01:39:56.121 --> 01:40:00.050
<v Speaker 5>Now the beautiful thing about MMA is that all these things can happen.</v>

3699
01:40:00.230 --> 01:40:02.840
<v Speaker 5>Like when were talking about earlier with Gi guavas and Marvin Kamin,</v>

3700
01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:03.411
<v Speaker 5>Tiago.</v>

3701
01:40:03.411 --> 01:40:07.880
<v Speaker 5>Elvis was tuning up Martin Kamin and he someone fucked up in his coach.</v>

3702
01:40:07.881 --> 01:40:08.271
<v Speaker 5>Someone,</v>

3703
01:40:08.271 --> 01:40:10.460
<v Speaker 5>someone apparently according to a belief,</v>

3704
01:40:10.461 --> 01:40:11.270
<v Speaker 5>Tiago said,</v>

3705
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:15.230
<v Speaker 5>someone called for a takedown after he had Martin hurt.</v>

3706
01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:18.200
<v Speaker 5>They were like take them down and take them down and he shot in and Martin has a</v>

3707
01:40:18.201 --> 01:40:18.890
<v Speaker 5>nasty,</v>

3708
01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:20.690
<v Speaker 5>it's just locked it up nice and tight.</v>

3709
01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:23.930
<v Speaker 5>That's what's the beautiful thing about MMA is that it could turn on a dime</v>

3710
01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:25.690
<v Speaker 5>because it represents real fighting.</v>

3711
01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:26.360
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

3712
01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.510
<v Speaker 5>for the average Yoko knucklehead,</v>

3713
01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:30.080
<v Speaker 5>they want to watch dude's throw knuckles,</v>

3714
01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:33.470
<v Speaker 5>Cam's right for the general audience they want to see big knock.</v>

3715
01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:36.200
<v Speaker 5>But the thing is it's just like flip or anything else.</v>

3716
01:40:36.201 --> 01:40:40.920
<v Speaker 5>The deeper you get into the sport more you appreciate like strategy and craft no</v>

3717
01:40:40.930 --> 01:40:41.210
<v Speaker 5>lives.</v>

3718
01:40:41.210 --> 01:40:44.180
<v Speaker 5>And I see him and I listened to you talk because you talked through the moves</v>

3719
01:40:44.181 --> 01:40:46.280
<v Speaker 5>and when he's on the ground and you can just see that,</v>

3720
01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:48.680
<v Speaker 5>that it just happening.</v>

3721
01:40:48.970 --> 01:40:49.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

3722
01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:50.240
<v Speaker 5>it's awesome.</v>

3723
01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:51.650
<v Speaker 5>Well Damien Maia versus Neil,</v>

3724
01:40:51.651 --> 01:40:53.210
<v Speaker 5>Maggie was a great example.</v>

3725
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:55.570
<v Speaker 5>Me Just like B in an awe.</v>

3726
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:56.460
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3727
01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:58.420
<v Speaker 5>like he like watching his grappling,</v>

3728
01:40:58.630 --> 01:40:58.931
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3729
01:40:58.931 --> 01:41:03.340
<v Speaker 5>as someone who was like seeing a lot of guys fight and a lot of like Jujitsu and</v>

3730
01:41:03.341 --> 01:41:03.761
<v Speaker 5>MMA.</v>

3731
01:41:03.761 --> 01:41:06.970
<v Speaker 5>Him and Rick store is another good example cause I know Rick story is a fucking</v>

3732
01:41:06.971 --> 01:41:08.770
<v Speaker 5>gorilla and he's a really good wrestler.</v>

3733
01:41:08.771 --> 01:41:09.301
<v Speaker 5>And the way my,</v>

3734
01:41:09.301 --> 01:41:14.260
<v Speaker 5>I put the clamp down on him and just slowly squeeze the life out of them like a</v>

3735
01:41:14.261 --> 01:41:16.990
<v Speaker 5>fucking Anaconda and got his back and neck cranked him.</v>

3736
01:41:16.991 --> 01:41:18.570
<v Speaker 5>It's like that's pretty drug.</v>

3737
01:41:18.571 --> 01:41:21.720
<v Speaker 5>That's where the commentating I think is so key to,</v>

3738
01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:22.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3739
01:41:22.150 --> 01:41:24.940
<v Speaker 5>cause you have to be able to explain what's going on because I don't know,</v>

3740
01:41:25.090 --> 01:41:26.380
<v Speaker 5>you also have to like it.</v>

3741
01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:32.120
<v Speaker 5>That goes down the knockouts meeting and Martin is my opinion.</v>

3742
01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:35.170
<v Speaker 5>I think people like MMA show huge now.</v>

3743
01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:36.670
<v Speaker 5>UFC in particular,</v>

3744
01:41:36.671 --> 01:41:38.920
<v Speaker 5>so huge because the knockouts,</v>

3745
01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:40.750
<v Speaker 5>unlike in boxing or kickboxing,</v>

3746
01:41:40.930 --> 01:41:45.880
<v Speaker 5>the knockouts mean more because that guy could have fucking dragged you down and</v>

3747
01:41:45.881 --> 01:41:46.714
<v Speaker 5>choked you out,</v>

3748
01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:47.650
<v Speaker 5>but you're knocked them out.</v>

3749
01:41:47.651 --> 01:41:48.370
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

3750
01:41:48.370 --> 01:41:49.450
<v Speaker 5>extra special.</v>

3751
01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:50.770
<v Speaker 5>So time sometimes,</v>

3752
01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:54.490
<v Speaker 5>but he's other knock is a perfect example.</v>

3753
01:41:54.491 --> 01:41:55.324
<v Speaker 5>Why that's not the case.</v>

3754
01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:55.710
<v Speaker 5>Me,</v>

3755
01:41:55.710 --> 01:41:56.890
<v Speaker 5>she'd taken Holly Holm.</v>

3756
01:41:57.130 --> 01:41:59.320
<v Speaker 5>It was one of the craziest fucking fights ever.</v>

3757
01:41:59.321 --> 01:42:00.131
<v Speaker 5>That was a wild,</v>

3758
01:42:00.131 --> 01:42:00.910
<v Speaker 5>crazy fight.</v>

3759
01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:05.120
<v Speaker 5>And Meesha take down on points takes her down in the fifth round and chokes.</v>

3760
01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:08.760
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3761
01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:11.620
<v Speaker 5>that's as dramatic as any knockout and you don't feel guilty about it.</v>

3762
01:42:11.621 --> 01:42:14.740
<v Speaker 5>Of course he don't feel like you watch someone get brained.</v>

3763
01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:15.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3764
01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:19.450
<v Speaker 5>I think the UFC kind of plays into what I'm talking about because they show the</v>

3765
01:42:19.451 --> 01:42:20.100
<v Speaker 5>knockouts.</v>

3766
01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:20.261
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3767
01:42:20.261 --> 01:42:22.540
<v Speaker 5>They don't show a choke out the highlights.</v>

3768
01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:23.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3769
01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:27.850
<v Speaker 5>Cause cause on Fox they don't show the top 10 submissions to knock out.</v>

3770
01:42:29.050 --> 01:42:29.890
<v Speaker 5>If they did,</v>

3771
01:42:29.891 --> 01:42:30.850
<v Speaker 5>it would be a hit.</v>

3772
01:42:30.990 --> 01:42:31.280
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3773
01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:32.410
<v Speaker 5>they could be a fuck.</v>

3774
01:42:32.411 --> 01:42:32.860
<v Speaker 5>Nah.</v>

3775
01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:34.660
<v Speaker 5>Not as big as I thought.</v>

3776
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:35.950
<v Speaker 5>I love juice to mourn striking.</v>

3777
01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:40.660
<v Speaker 5>Not as big as the hit us knocked out just as big boys.</v>

3778
01:42:40.661 --> 01:42:43.740
<v Speaker 5>We are about to see the best submissions.</v>

3779
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:45.520
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't get to it,</v>

3780
01:42:45.521 --> 01:42:46.271
<v Speaker 5>but in general,</v>

3781
01:42:46.271 --> 01:42:47.200
<v Speaker 5>people in Snow White,</v>

3782
01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:50.080
<v Speaker 5>this is a real possibility in this fight.</v>

3783
01:42:50.081 --> 01:42:52.030
<v Speaker 5>Let's take this and to consider snow grappling going on.</v>

3784
01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:52.940
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

3785
01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:53.320
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3786
01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:54.153
<v Speaker 5>you don't know.</v>

3787
01:42:54.670 --> 01:42:58.090
<v Speaker 5>Michael Bisping might try and take Dan Henderson down thinking that Dan</v>

3788
01:42:58.090 --> 01:42:59.120
<v Speaker 5>Henderson maybe gets tired,</v>

3789
01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:00.490
<v Speaker 5>took him down and he's older.</v>

3790
01:43:01.690 --> 01:43:03.070
<v Speaker 5>Who knows what's going to happen here.</v>

3791
01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:04.430
<v Speaker 5>I think Bisbing boxes.</v>

3792
01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:07.630
<v Speaker 5>This is going to be crazy.</v>

3793
01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:09.010
<v Speaker 5>It's going on right now.</v>

3794
01:43:09.130 --> 01:43:11.860
<v Speaker 5>He just has to avoid that giant fucking h bomb.</v>

3795
01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:12.813
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3796
01:43:13.450 --> 01:43:16.980
<v Speaker 5>just circle to do it with one eye and go get that touch</v>

3797
01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:19.533
<v Speaker 5>to the back of the head.</v>

3798
01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:21.760
<v Speaker 5>How do they let 'em fight with one arm in the elbow?</v>

3799
01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:22.031
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3800
01:43:22.031 --> 01:43:22.930
<v Speaker 5>he can see enough.</v>

3801
01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:24.101
<v Speaker 5>He could see enough.</v>

3802
01:43:24.101 --> 01:43:25.810
<v Speaker 5>Apparently all that stuff does.</v>

3803
01:43:25.811 --> 01:43:29.500
<v Speaker 5>It's not like his vision is devastated to the point of no repair.</v>

3804
01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:32.530
<v Speaker 5>It's like he needs that in there to keep it as retina intact.</v>

3805
01:43:32.770 --> 01:43:35.850
<v Speaker 5>Only he knows and his doctors how well he could see from what,</v>

3806
01:43:35.851 --> 01:43:36.730
<v Speaker 5>but it ain't perfect.</v>

3807
01:43:36.731 --> 01:43:38.460
<v Speaker 5>How good does Dan look physically?</v>

3808
01:43:38.461 --> 01:43:38.661
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3809
01:43:38.661 --> 01:43:39.494
<v Speaker 5>it looks great.</v>

3810
01:43:39.730 --> 01:43:40.211
<v Speaker 5>Powerful.</v>

3811
01:43:40.211 --> 01:43:41.044
<v Speaker 5>10 too.</v>

3812
01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:41.751
<v Speaker 5>He brought an art,</v>

3813
01:43:41.751 --> 01:43:42.790
<v Speaker 5>some leaven for this camp.</v>

3814
01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:43.001
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3815
01:43:43.001 --> 01:43:43.450
<v Speaker 5>duty.</v>

3816
01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:43.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3817
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:44.583
<v Speaker 5>Damn.</v>

3818
01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:44.831
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3819
01:43:44.831 --> 01:43:49.480
<v Speaker 5>A lot of pictures of him sparring with arts 11 on Instagram 11 who's a former</v>

3820
01:43:49.481 --> 01:43:51.970
<v Speaker 5>world muy Thai champion Joe Forum,</v>

3821
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.450
<v Speaker 5>like Super High Level Guy.</v>

3822
01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:56.210
<v Speaker 5>He was a glory champ.</v>

3823
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.781
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3824
01:43:56.781 --> 01:44:00.040
<v Speaker 5>switch kick by perilla cause Bisping's coach said he,</v>

3825
01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:02.450
<v Speaker 5>he thinks business wins by left high kick dude.</v>

3826
01:44:02.451 --> 01:44:02.991
<v Speaker 5>He just switched,</v>

3827
01:44:02.991 --> 01:44:04.270
<v Speaker 5>kicked him up behind.</v>

3828
01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:05.660
<v Speaker 5>It looks smooth as fuck did he?</v>

3829
01:44:05.661 --> 01:44:06.321
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see that.</v>

3830
01:44:06.321 --> 01:44:07.670
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean he blocked it,</v>

3831
01:44:07.671 --> 01:44:09.050
<v Speaker 5>but it looks smooth as fuck.</v>

3832
01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:10.110
<v Speaker 5>Bisping's fight.</v>

3833
01:44:10.110 --> 01:44:10.830
<v Speaker 5>Nice.</v>

3834
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:13.370
<v Speaker 5>I don't get why more people don't talk about is his striking coach.</v>

3835
01:44:13.371 --> 01:44:13.581
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3836
01:44:13.581 --> 01:44:16.250
<v Speaker 5>it's cyborg striking coach and lesbians.</v>

3837
01:44:16.710 --> 01:44:19.290
<v Speaker 5>Two monsters will and Bj Penn,</v>

3838
01:44:19.291 --> 01:44:21.250
<v Speaker 5>he worked with PJ Penn chasen pearls.</v>

3839
01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:23.300
<v Speaker 5>A bad motherfucker out of the fight,</v>

3840
01:44:23.301 --> 01:44:23.720
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

3841
01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:24.351
<v Speaker 5>Yes he is.</v>

3842
01:44:24.351 --> 01:44:27.330
<v Speaker 5>And he canceled the entire card because of the God dog to the</v>

3843
01:44:29.150 --> 01:44:30.410
<v Speaker 5>Bj got injured apparently.</v>

3844
01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:30.860
<v Speaker 5>Damn.</v>

3845
01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:31.880
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the injury is.</v>

3846
01:44:31.881 --> 01:44:33.620
<v Speaker 5>Let me some Bj Penn love him.</v>

3847
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:34.910
<v Speaker 5>But you know what man,</v>

3848
01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:38.000
<v Speaker 5>that was a crazy way to jump back into the pool.</v>

3849
01:44:38.150 --> 01:44:38.930
<v Speaker 5>Get barreled,</v>

3850
01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:41.060
<v Speaker 5>says I get him F's favorable.</v>

3851
01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:41.340
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

3852
01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:41.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3853
01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:42.290
<v Speaker 5>we don't know.</v>

3854
01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:45.050
<v Speaker 5>He looked terrible and his last fight I thought when he fought Frankie Edgar.</v>

3855
01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:45.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3856
01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:48.290
<v Speaker 5>You've got to realize is also fighting a monster.</v>

3857
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.431
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3858
01:44:48.431 --> 01:44:49.960
<v Speaker 5>But we never seen him like this dad.</v>

3859
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:50.151
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3860
01:44:50.151 --> 01:44:52.530
<v Speaker 5>we have the hype was the hall staff,</v>

3861
01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:56.960
<v Speaker 5>but that was also camp in Hawaii and since then he trained at Greg Jackson's</v>

3862
01:44:56.961 --> 01:44:58.160
<v Speaker 5>music in there for a long time.</v>

3863
01:44:58.161 --> 01:45:01.160
<v Speaker 5>Now that right to handle landed a right hand.</v>

3864
01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:06.260
<v Speaker 5>Pa Did do this one's only that thing lands plus this bitch is over.</v>

3865
01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:08.540
<v Speaker 5>You've got a 46 year old world champion.</v>

3866
01:45:08.690 --> 01:45:09.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3867
01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:10.130
<v Speaker 5>If it lands,</v>

3868
01:45:10.190 --> 01:45:10.971
<v Speaker 5>if it lands,</v>

3869
01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:12.800
<v Speaker 5>it landed once on everybody.</v>

3870
01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:13.190
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3871
01:45:13.190 --> 01:45:14.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean nobody can take that.</v>

3872
01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:15.981
<v Speaker 5>Cain Velasquez,</v>

3873
01:45:15.981 --> 01:45:18.270
<v Speaker 5>we got knocked out bolt right and he's left hook to man.</v>

3874
01:45:18.271 --> 01:45:18.620
<v Speaker 5>She know.</v>

3875
01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:19.020
<v Speaker 5>Busy.</v>

3876
01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:20.870
<v Speaker 5>Just thinking about that right now.</v>

3877
01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:21.591
<v Speaker 5>Yes he is,</v>

3878
01:45:21.591 --> 01:45:22.460
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't matter.</v>

3879
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:23.720
<v Speaker 5>So it was Hector Lombard.</v>

3880
01:45:24.170 --> 01:45:26.670
<v Speaker 5>The thing about Dan Henderson is he,</v>

3881
01:45:26.710 --> 01:45:31.370
<v Speaker 5>he's got that one touch thing going on where he can just connect out of nowhere.</v>

3882
01:45:31.371 --> 01:45:32.100
<v Speaker 5>Like with Lumbar,</v>

3883
01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:34.040
<v Speaker 5>he hits him in the back elbow and puts them asleep.</v>

3884
01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:36.550
<v Speaker 5>Who the fuck does that heard?</v>

3885
01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:39.110
<v Speaker 5>That's a bar room to take a picture with Dan Henderson.</v>

3886
01:45:39.111 --> 01:45:40.010
<v Speaker 5>Put your hand on his back.</v>

3887
01:45:40.011 --> 01:45:43.100
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're holding one of those Indian Indian statues that has cigars.</v>

3888
01:45:43.230 --> 01:45:43.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3889
01:45:43.730 --> 01:45:46.010
<v Speaker 5>It's like all raw touches made out of wood.</v>

3890
01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:46.670
<v Speaker 5>Pure would.</v>

3891
01:45:46.670 --> 01:45:48.260
<v Speaker 5>He does like Ryan Parsons,</v>

3892
01:45:48.261 --> 01:45:50.420
<v Speaker 5>who was his manager and his trainer for a long time.</v>

3893
01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:52.370
<v Speaker 5>Ryan Parsons used to do massage on him.</v>

3894
01:45:52.371 --> 01:45:52.880
<v Speaker 5>Like he had deep,</v>

3895
01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:53.600
<v Speaker 5>deep tissue on it.</v>

3896
01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:53.930
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

3897
01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:54.171
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

3898
01:45:54.171 --> 01:45:55.520
<v Speaker 5>I'd be fucking exhausted.</v>

3899
01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:56.301
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

3900
01:45:56.301 --> 01:45:57.134
<v Speaker 5>I've never,</v>

3901
01:45:57.230 --> 01:46:00.710
<v Speaker 5>I've never massaged anybody or you know Ryan's chiropractor too,</v>

3902
01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:03.050
<v Speaker 5>cause I'd never manipulate anybody who's is dense,</v>

3903
01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:03.920
<v Speaker 5>Dan.</v>

3904
01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:04.753
<v Speaker 5>Is that,</v>

3905
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:05.780
<v Speaker 5>is their blood coming?</v>

3906
01:46:05.781 --> 01:46:07.370
<v Speaker 5>So there's blood on top of his head.</v>

3907
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:08.263
<v Speaker 5>There is.</v>

3908
01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:10.880
<v Speaker 5>That was from the first one purse left.</v>

3909
01:46:10.881 --> 01:46:11.541
<v Speaker 5>Where's the blood?</v>

3910
01:46:11.541 --> 01:46:12.080
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3911
01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:14.120
<v Speaker 5>it looks like some of the top of his hairline.</v>

3912
01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:14.993
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3913
01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:16.550
<v Speaker 5>There's an lag from a headbutt.</v>

3914
01:46:16.610 --> 01:46:16.911
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3915
01:46:16.911 --> 01:46:17.810
<v Speaker 5>Is that left jab?</v>

3916
01:46:17.811 --> 01:46:18.090
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

3917
01:46:18.090 --> 01:46:19.940
<v Speaker 5>Well the good news is you already can't see.</v>

3918
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:21.440
<v Speaker 5>So it's probably not bothering them at all.</v>

3919
01:46:21.441 --> 01:46:22.550
<v Speaker 5>As long as doesn't go in the other eye,</v>

3920
01:46:22.551 --> 01:46:23.480
<v Speaker 5>then he's blind.</v>

3921
01:46:23.481 --> 01:46:23.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3922
01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:24.740
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't give a fuck.</v>

3923
01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:24.951
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3924
01:46:24.951 --> 01:46:25.490
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't.</v>

3925
01:46:25.490 --> 01:46:26.990
<v Speaker 5>Who was more game than Michael Bisping?</v>

3926
01:46:27.210 --> 01:46:28.160
<v Speaker 5>He never met a guy.</v>

3927
01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:28.980
<v Speaker 5>And let me ask you this,</v>

3928
01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:32.390
<v Speaker 5>has any guy benefited more than the TRT movement then?</v>

3929
01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:33.233
<v Speaker 5>Bisping.</v>

3930
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:34.430
<v Speaker 5>He's one of them.</v>

3931
01:46:34.730 --> 01:46:35.600
<v Speaker 5>He's world champ.</v>

3932
01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:36.050

3935
01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:39.590
<v Speaker 5>But he never suffered from it.</v>

3936
01:46:39.591 --> 01:46:42.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying busily bath routine off fought him on that shit.</v>

3943
01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:50.190
<v Speaker 5>Flat guys lost the only guys</v>

3945
01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:51.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3946
01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:52.410
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

3947
01:46:52.410 --> 01:46:54.630
<v Speaker 2>And took him 10 years to get his fucking title shot.</v>

3948
01:46:54.631 --> 01:46:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Then he gets it on what an eight day knows and beats Lula Rockhold cold stuff.</v>

01:47:20.701 --> 01:47:22.890
<v Speaker 2>but almost as a really important point.</v>

3971
01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Like we're sliding just out of the way.</v>

3972
01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:27.720
<v Speaker 2>I know that timing,</v>

3973
01:47:27.970 --> 01:47:28.803
<v Speaker 2>that timing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3975
01:47:29.371 --> 01:47:31.440

3976
01:47:31.470 --> 01:47:33.570
<v Speaker 2>But you see the way the distance between,</v>

4018
01:48:39.841 --> 01:48:40.890
<v Speaker 2>It's below the eye.</v>

4019
01:48:41.010 --> 01:48:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Whatever's happening up top is in the forehead,</v>

4020
01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:45.870
<v Speaker 2>which bleeds a lot but not that bad.</v>

4021
01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4022
01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:47.580
<v Speaker 2>that's his good eye.</v>

4023
01:48:47.581 --> 01:48:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that going to swell?</v>

4024
01:48:48.541 --> 01:48:48.960
<v Speaker 2>Shut?</v>

4025
01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:49.590
<v Speaker 2>It could,</v>

4026
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:51.150
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing.</v>

4027
01:48:51.210 --> 01:48:52.140
<v Speaker 2>They're working on the cut.</v>

4028
01:48:52.170 --> 01:48:53.003
<v Speaker 2>The real problem.</v>

4029
01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:58.490
<v Speaker 2>The one thing you don't want to happen almost.</v>

4030
01:48:58.510 --> 01:48:59.370
<v Speaker 2>This is a good point</v>

4031
01:49:01.170 --> 01:49:02.380
<v Speaker 2>and that was not almost</v>

4032
01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:09.000
<v Speaker 2>exact same thing.</v>

4033
01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Dodged a bullet.</v>

4034
01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Crazy pressure bisman is under right now.</v>

4035
01:49:14.591 --> 01:49:17.400
<v Speaker 2>If I feel for the guy and I don't want him to lose,</v>

4036
01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:18.751
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

4037
01:49:18.751 --> 01:49:19.140
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4038
01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:22.850
<v Speaker 2>that fucking Dan can definitely still knock them out 100% right?</v>

4039
01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.060
<v Speaker 2>He knock anybody out.</v>

4040
01:49:24.061 --> 01:49:24.894
<v Speaker 2>We said that before,</v>

4041
01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:27.030
<v Speaker 2>but it's being survived.</v>

4042
01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:27.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4043
01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:30.070
<v Speaker 2>just the fact that he's able to survive this goddamn gigantic.</v>

4044
01:49:30.071 --> 01:49:32.230
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna mess up your cardio two a little bit though,</v>

4045
01:49:32.231 --> 01:49:32.930
<v Speaker 2>if you're busy.</v>

4046
01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Mine,</v>

4047
01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:34.500
<v Speaker 2>but Bisping again.</v>

4048
01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4049
01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:35.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about is ridiculous.</v>

4050
01:49:35.911 --> 01:49:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Cardio.</v>

4051
01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:37.950
<v Speaker 2>Remember is Anderson Silva fight?</v>

4052
01:49:37.951 --> 01:49:39.080
<v Speaker 2>He was basically out in that tune,</v>

4053
01:49:39.090 --> 01:49:39.923
<v Speaker 2>came back.</v>

4054
01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:41.311
<v Speaker 2>He was out,</v>

4055
01:49:41.311 --> 01:49:41.590
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

4056

4057
01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:44.370
<v Speaker 2>flying flat face and Anderson.</v>

4058
01:49:44.371 --> 01:49:48.400
<v Speaker 2>You've walked away from it like it was like it was a walkaway and the referee</v>

4059
01:49:48.401 --> 01:49:49.320
<v Speaker 2>kept the fight going down.</v>

4060
01:49:49.330 --> 01:49:50.750
<v Speaker 2>Her Dean said no big deal to herb.</v>

4061
01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:51.191
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

4062
01:49:51.191 --> 01:49:51.431

4073
01:50:10.690 --> 01:50:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Goddammit.</v>

01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:13.570
<v Speaker 2>oh look at that inside leg kick.</v>

4077
01:50:13.571 --> 01:50:14.860
<v Speaker 2>He and that was beautiful technique.</v>

4078
01:50:14.861 --> 01:50:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Fake the right hand.</v>

4079
01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Now he went high with it.</v>

4080
01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:17.973
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

4081
01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:20.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4082
01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:22.760
<v Speaker 2>he really doesn't give a fuck about any of that.</v>

4083
01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:24.970
<v Speaker 2>He's just ready to fire this h bomb.</v>

4084
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:26.200
<v Speaker 2>That all still sucks.</v>

4085
01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:28.570
<v Speaker 2>I liked the way Bisping's moving.</v>

4086
01:50:28.571 --> 01:50:30.070
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that Dan can't land it,</v>

4087
01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:31.023
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing.</v>

4088
01:50:31.310 --> 01:50:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Well you brought up camps,</v>

4089
01:50:32.581 --> 01:50:35.980
<v Speaker 2>super important that left eyes swelling hardcore right now.</v>

4090
01:50:37.390 --> 01:50:38.223
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't mind a tip.</v>

4091
01:50:39.230 --> 01:50:40.063
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>

4092
01:50:40.670 --> 01:50:41.140
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

4093
01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:42.390
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't look hurt at all.</v>

4094
01:50:42.391 --> 01:50:43.420
<v Speaker 2>It just needs to get a little,</v>

4095
01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:47.530
<v Speaker 2>I just need to get a sweat on maybe gas during that flourish.</v>

4096
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:49.183
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'd have.</v>

4097
01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:51.610
<v Speaker 2>He was going for the knockout.</v>

4098
01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:52.590
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have any energy.</v>

4099
01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.340
<v Speaker 2>It's not a volume.</v>

4100
01:50:54.341 --> 01:50:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Punches him in the knee.</v>

4101
01:50:55.970 --> 01:50:56.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4102
01:50:56.151 --> 01:50:57.880
<v Speaker 2>I just punched him in and he's not a volume puncher.</v>

4103
01:50:57.881 --> 01:51:01.270
<v Speaker 2>He might just be waiting to land that fucking nuclear bomb.</v>

4104
01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:01.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4105
01:51:01.421 --> 01:51:01.841
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>

4106
01:51:01.841 --> 01:51:03.970
<v Speaker 2>he keeps getting hit with that switch kick to the arms.</v>

4107
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.040
<v Speaker 2>That shit takes a lot of,</v>

4108
01:51:05.041 --> 01:51:05.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>

4109
01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:06.333
<v Speaker 2>Does</v>

4110
01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Michael Bisping looking for the power right hand over the top.</v>

4111
01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:10.991
<v Speaker 2>You know what the scary thing?</v>

4112
01:51:10.991 --> 01:51:11.380
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

4113
01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:13.990
<v Speaker 2>He's cause Bisbing that they play that highlight him getting knocked out,</v>

4114
01:51:13.991 --> 01:51:14.171
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4115
01:51:14.171 --> 01:51:16.030
<v Speaker 2>It's Dan Hill Shins fucking logo.</v>

4116
01:51:16.090 --> 01:51:17.110
<v Speaker 2>So going into the fight,</v>

4117
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:18.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming he wants that revenge.</v>

4118
01:51:18.941 --> 01:51:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Try and knock them out.</v>

4119
01:51:19.970 --> 01:51:20.803
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

4120
01:51:22.170 --> 01:51:23.530
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a slap that didn't land.</v>

4121
01:51:23.531 --> 01:51:24.364
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4122
01:51:24.730 --> 01:51:25.750
<v Speaker 2>you guys are both blind.</v>

4123
01:51:26.250 --> 01:51:27.083
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck.</v>

4124
01:51:27.410 --> 01:51:28.280
<v Speaker 2>13 vision.</v>

4125
01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:34.440
<v Speaker 2>10 1510 15 oh inside.</v>

4126
01:51:34.990 --> 01:51:35.823
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:38.261
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

4128
01:51:38.261 --> 01:51:39.160
<v Speaker 2>if he pulls this off,</v>

4129
01:51:39.161 --> 01:51:40.330
<v Speaker 2>this is the craziest,</v>

4130
01:51:40.331 --> 01:51:42.250
<v Speaker 2>you know I find ever.</v>

4131
01:51:45.650 --> 01:51:46.483
<v Speaker 2>Goodness.</v>

4132
01:51:49.150 --> 01:51:50.800
<v Speaker 2>That's an old possum too.</v>

4133
01:51:50.801 --> 01:51:52.710
<v Speaker 2>He's seen this before was like a bus crap.</v>

4134
01:51:53.610 --> 01:51:54.820
<v Speaker 2>What's scary than a possum?</v>

4135
01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:55.630
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

4136
01:51:55.630 --> 01:51:56.171
<v Speaker 2>Badger.</v>

4137
01:51:56.171 --> 01:51:57.190
<v Speaker 2>He's more of a pageant.</v>

4138
01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:58.440
<v Speaker 2>The honeybadger.</v>

4139
01:51:58.910 --> 01:52:01.120
<v Speaker 2>How'd he bagger God?</v>

4140
01:52:01.150 --> 01:52:02.040
<v Speaker 2>Be careful down.</v>

4141
01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:03.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

4142
01:52:03.431 --> 01:52:04.211
<v Speaker 2>That left high kicks.</v>

4143
01:52:04.211 --> 01:52:04.841
<v Speaker 2>A big factor.</v>

4144
01:52:04.841 --> 01:52:05.850
<v Speaker 2>That's why they were talking about it,</v>

4145
01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:06.150
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

4146
01:52:06.150 --> 01:52:06.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4147
01:52:06.401 --> 01:52:07.930
<v Speaker 2>This thing is a beautiful left high kick</v>

4148
01:52:09.850 --> 01:52:10.750
<v Speaker 2>looking for the right hand.</v>

4149
01:52:10.751 --> 01:52:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Bisbee is looking to catch him with a right hand.</v>

4150
01:52:12.730 --> 01:52:15.430
<v Speaker 2>They've got to get that end swell on the fucking I in between the rounds.</v>

4151
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:16.743
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4152
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:20.590
<v Speaker 2>spent some time in Thailand for this camp to see that video.</v>

4153
01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:22.000
<v Speaker 2>I fuck you're just kicking.</v>

4154
01:52:22.001 --> 01:52:22.360
<v Speaker 2>I looked,</v>

4155
01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.193
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4156
01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:24.713
<v Speaker 2>every fight.</v>

4157
01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:27.490
<v Speaker 2>He's the champ too.</v>

4158
01:52:27.491 --> 01:52:31.180
<v Speaker 2>You have to respect the fact that him winning the champ did championship.</v>

4159
01:52:31.181 --> 01:52:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Must have had an extreme effect as confidence.</v>

4160
01:52:33.661 --> 01:52:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4161
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:34.271
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

4162
01:52:34.271 --> 01:52:36.520
<v Speaker 2>and he's a guy that's never lacked confidence.</v>

4163
01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:38.053
<v Speaker 2>He gets to bed.</v>

4164
01:52:38.130 --> 01:52:38.501
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

4165
01:52:38.501 --> 01:52:39.334
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>

4166
01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:41.700
<v Speaker 2>I told you I was fucking right.</v>

4167
01:52:41.710 --> 01:52:45.860
<v Speaker 2>Told you all fruit pastels for everybody got big balls in the UK.</v>

4168
01:52:45.940 --> 01:52:46.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4169
01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:49.153
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4170
01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Carter's considered UK in Ireland.</v>

4171
01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:53.053
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4172
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.291
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

4173
01:52:54.291 --> 01:52:55.400
<v Speaker 2>look at that knee of the body.</v>

4174
01:52:55.850 --> 01:52:58.910
<v Speaker 2>People now they don't even know what the fucking UK is.</v>

4175
01:53:00.490 --> 01:53:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Shut it off.</v>

4176
01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4177
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:07.760
<v Speaker 2>he say low.</v>

4178
01:53:07.761 --> 01:53:08.061
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

4179
01:53:08.061 --> 01:53:08.450
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

4180
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:09.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

4181
01:53:09.441 --> 01:53:10.274
<v Speaker 2>Be careful now.</v>

4182
01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Hateful combination.</v>

4183
01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:12.693
<v Speaker 2>You Levine.</v>

4184
01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4185
01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:17.153
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>

4186
01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:19.433
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

4187
01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:26.030
<v Speaker 2>He's covering his mouth</v>

4188
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:29.783
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

4189
01:53:30.630 --> 01:53:31.600
<v Speaker 2>It's so wrong.</v>

4190
01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:35.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm free so we can cover his mouth again.</v>

4191
01:53:36.890 --> 01:53:38.710
<v Speaker 2>That is some old man.</v>

4192
01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:42.030
<v Speaker 2>He's going to break that clench and he's going to rise</v>

4193
01:53:43.590 --> 01:53:44.000
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

4194
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:44.833
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this,</v>

4195
01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:46.053
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4196
01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:46.973
<v Speaker 2>this round too.</v>

4197
01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:47.991
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking,</v>

4198
01:53:47.991 --> 01:53:50.270
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck to rep Bisping's tuning them up.</v>

4199
01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:51.380
<v Speaker 2>Bisbing how about this?</v>

4200
01:53:51.530 --> 01:53:52.300
<v Speaker 2>You got to go.</v>

4201
01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:53.030
<v Speaker 2>Listen man.</v>

4202
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:55.010
<v Speaker 2>He thought he thought he had it,</v>

4203
01:53:55.011 --> 01:53:55.311
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4204
01:53:55.311 --> 01:53:56.210
<v Speaker 2>He thought he had it.</v>

4205
01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:57.470
<v Speaker 2>He was turning it on.</v>

4206
01:53:57.471 --> 01:53:58.580
<v Speaker 2>If I was going to win by knockout,</v>

4207
01:53:58.581 --> 01:54:02.090
<v Speaker 2>he's so confident and Henderson just drops the fucking,</v>

4208
01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:05.600
<v Speaker 2>how about keep that left?</v>

4209
01:54:05.601 --> 01:54:06.240
<v Speaker 2>Don't look at that.</v>

4210
01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Is tying them up pretty good coming back.</v>

4211
01:54:10.980 --> 01:54:11.600
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be,</v>

4212
01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:13.180
<v Speaker 2>he's going to rise up and</v>

4213
01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:16.910
<v Speaker 2>it's in England,</v>

4214
01:54:16.930 --> 01:54:17.763
<v Speaker 2>so may help.</v>

4215
01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:19.400
<v Speaker 2>It'd be tough to get busy in that round.</v>

4216
01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:20.001
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

4217
01:54:20.001 --> 01:54:25.001
<v Speaker 2>that's a weird round man because for sure Henderson had one spectacular moment.</v>

4218
01:54:25.710 --> 01:54:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4219
01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:30.680
<v Speaker 2>for sure before that first three to give that to Henderson first three and a</v>

4220
01:54:30.681 --> 01:54:31.820
<v Speaker 2>half minutes as Biz being,</v>

4221
01:54:32.210 --> 01:54:33.230
<v Speaker 2>you look at the round and said,</v>

4222
01:54:33.231 --> 01:54:34.300
<v Speaker 2>who won that round to</v>

4223
01:54:36.590 --> 01:54:37.251
<v Speaker 2>put them away.</v>

4224
01:54:37.251 --> 01:54:38.084
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>

4225
01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

4226
01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:39.733
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

4227
01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:41.900
<v Speaker 2>He tuned Henderson.</v>

4228
01:54:43.570 --> 01:54:44.403
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

4229
01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:50.720
<v Speaker 2>oh my God and Bisping's like what?</v>

4230
01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:52.310
<v Speaker 2>Notice the eave Levine.</v>

4231
01:54:52.311 --> 01:54:53.630
<v Speaker 2>We'll let you get yo ass</v>

4232
01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:00.490
<v Speaker 2>evil Levine.</v>

4233
01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

4234
01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:04.730
<v Speaker 2>He's asking question.</v>

4235
01:55:04.731 --> 01:55:05.420
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

4236
01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:06.231
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>

4237
01:55:06.231 --> 01:55:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Come on please.</v>

4238
01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:08.150
<v Speaker 2>It's been fuck man.</v>

4239
01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:10.760
<v Speaker 2>While he's getting well,</v>

4240
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:11.900
<v Speaker 2>see they're working on the cut,</v>

4241
01:55:11.901 --> 01:55:13.160
<v Speaker 2>but there's all that swelling.</v>

4242
01:55:13.161 --> 01:55:13.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't see them.</v>

4243
01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:14.151
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4244
01:55:14.151 --> 01:55:14.511
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

4245
01:55:14.511 --> 01:55:15.890
<v Speaker 2>maybe they weren't where we weren't looking at it,</v>

4246
01:55:15.891 --> 01:55:18.260
<v Speaker 2>but I would like to see them have that metal piece,</v>

4247
01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:21.530
<v Speaker 2>put that shit on and at the end when you know there's 10 seconds left,</v>

4248
01:55:21.650 --> 01:55:24.530
<v Speaker 2>then you put that shit on that cut and fill it up.</v>

4249
01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:26.480
<v Speaker 2>But the most important things that he can see,</v>

4250
01:55:26.481 --> 01:55:30.200
<v Speaker 2>the crowd is not going to affect his vision because he drives out twice with</v>

4251
01:55:30.201 --> 01:55:31.050
<v Speaker 2>that harm.</v>

4252
01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:33.200
<v Speaker 2>How good is Bisbing Chin though?</v>

4253
01:55:33.370 --> 01:55:35.270
<v Speaker 2>I know it's hard,</v>

4254
01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:40.310
<v Speaker 2>but you gotta realize that Bisbing part of that flurry was him kicking Henderson</v>

4255
01:55:40.311 --> 01:55:40.851
<v Speaker 2>and the Dick.</v>

4256
01:55:40.851 --> 01:55:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Now that we know that for sure.</v>

4257
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4258
01:55:42.930 --> 01:55:44.250
<v Speaker 2>I left high kick again</v>

4259
01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:48.480
<v Speaker 5>to keep coming because it's like a fucking bear trap.</v>

4260
01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:51.510
<v Speaker 5>So do you give the first two rounds to Henderson?</v>

4261
01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:52.381
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

4262
01:55:52.381 --> 01:55:52.650
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4263
01:55:52.650 --> 01:55:53.460
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

4264
01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:58.050
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the kick to the deck now that I know it was a kick to the Dick.</v>

4265
01:55:58.110 --> 01:55:58.910
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4266
01:55:58.910 --> 01:56:00.290
<v Speaker 5>I might say.</v>

4267
01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:03.690
<v Speaker 5>I might say it's an even round or you might be able to give it to Bisping.</v>

4268
01:56:04.110 --> 01:56:04.760
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4269
01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:05.541
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

4270
01:56:05.541 --> 01:56:06.030
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

4271
01:56:06.030 --> 01:56:06.960
<v Speaker 5>How would they kicked him out?</v>

4272
01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:08.290
<v Speaker 5>Didn't sway you more towards him.</v>

4273
01:56:08.610 --> 01:56:12.450
<v Speaker 5>He almost finished it in the second round and the first round,</v>

4274
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:15.050
<v Speaker 5>the truth around when he always left son.</v>

4275
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.661
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>

4276
01:56:15.661 --> 01:56:16.530
<v Speaker 5>The almost finished him.</v>

4277
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.741
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4278
01:56:16.741 --> 01:56:17.580
<v Speaker 5>you got a good point.</v>

4279
01:56:17.581 --> 01:56:17.791
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4280
01:56:17.791 --> 01:56:18.900
<v Speaker 5>I'm just making an argument,</v>

4281
01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:19.813
<v Speaker 5>but what do we,</v>

4282
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:20.700
<v Speaker 5>what are we judging?</v>

4283
01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:24.280
<v Speaker 5>You know there's two rounds kicks to the knee first two rather than going like</v>

4284
01:56:24.281 --> 01:56:25.920
<v Speaker 5>Ha Henderson could almost a finished him.</v>

4285
01:56:26.070 --> 01:56:26.341
<v Speaker 5>Yup,</v>

4286
01:56:26.341 --> 01:56:26.790
<v Speaker 5>correct.</v>

4287
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:29.370
<v Speaker 5>But it looked like Bisping was coming on strong in the second round,</v>

4288
01:56:29.371 --> 01:56:30.870
<v Speaker 5>but now we know as a kick to the deck,</v>

4289
01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:32.400
<v Speaker 5>it had a big factor in there.</v>

4290
01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:33.490
<v Speaker 5>Think about if you're a judge,</v>

4291
01:56:33.610 --> 01:56:34.081
<v Speaker 5>you're thinking,</v>

4292
01:56:34.081 --> 01:56:34.351
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

4293
01:56:34.351 --> 01:56:36.510
<v Speaker 5>who did the most damage and the most shots.</v>

4294
01:56:36.511 --> 01:56:37.820
<v Speaker 5>If you look at the strike stats,</v>

4295
01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:39.930
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you Bisping's landed way more shot.</v>

4296
01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:40.770
<v Speaker 5>You don't care.</v>

4297
01:56:40.770 --> 01:56:41.430
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4298
01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:42.450
<v Speaker 5>they don't care about that.</v>

4299
01:56:42.451 --> 01:56:46.680
<v Speaker 5>Usually look at Dotson Linacre but the actual volume,</v>

4300
01:56:46.710 --> 01:56:47.011
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4301
01:56:47.011 --> 01:56:48.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm embarrassed to say I have not seen that fight.</v>

4302
01:56:49.050 --> 01:56:49.521
<v Speaker 5>I'll dare you,</v>

4303
01:56:49.521 --> 01:56:49.860
<v Speaker 5>sir.</v>

4304
01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:50.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm embarrassed.</v>

4305
01:56:50.690 --> 01:56:50.840
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4306
01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:51.990
<v Speaker 5>you've been killing elk,</v>

4307
01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:53.010
<v Speaker 5>so I'll give you out there.</v>

4308
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:55.710
<v Speaker 5>I got to get a year's worth of meat in one shot.</v>

4309
01:56:55.740 --> 01:56:56.091
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

4310
01:56:56.091 --> 01:56:56.924
<v Speaker 5>that's fair.</v>

4311
01:56:57.210 --> 01:56:58.440
<v Speaker 5>It's more fighting for his family.</v>

4312
01:56:58.890 --> 01:56:59.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a grill.</v>

4313
01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:01.440
<v Speaker 5>How dare I wish you would make some of the,</v>

4314
01:57:01.450 --> 01:57:06.450
<v Speaker 5>and I know you American grown on the guys talking about grill big.</v>

4315
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:09.870
<v Speaker 5>It looks very good.</v>

4316
01:57:09.930 --> 01:57:10.800
<v Speaker 5>Look at that Jab.</v>

4317
01:57:11.370 --> 01:57:12.480
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing about Bisping,</v>

4318
01:57:12.481 --> 01:57:12.811
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4319
01:57:12.811 --> 01:57:15.360
<v Speaker 5>He's looking at fluid and smooth,</v>

4320
01:57:15.390 --> 01:57:19.110
<v Speaker 5>even in the face of dire danger and he's looking bloody,</v>

4321
01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:20.640
<v Speaker 5>but he's not changing his game plan.</v>

4322
01:57:20.641 --> 01:57:24.630
<v Speaker 5>Like he's doing fucking win by knockout man.</v>

4323
01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:26.950
<v Speaker 5>He wants it to bad cell phones.</v>

4324
01:57:27.390 --> 01:57:30.240
<v Speaker 5>So far he's been able to survive like,</v>

4325
01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:32.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's got to go after him.</v>

4326
01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:32.870
<v Speaker 5>He's got out,</v>

4327
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:34.290
<v Speaker 5>he wants to where Dan out.</v>

4328
01:57:34.291 --> 01:57:35.100
<v Speaker 5>And right now we're,</v>

4329
01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:36.330
<v Speaker 5>we're headed into the third,</v>

4330
01:57:36.331 --> 01:57:36.780
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4331
01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:39.390
<v Speaker 5>So we got two 15 the third,</v>

4332
01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:42.000
<v Speaker 5>we got two more rounds after this.</v>

4333
01:57:42.001 --> 01:57:42.960
<v Speaker 5>This is crazy.</v>

4334
01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:43.620
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4335
01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:44.610
<v Speaker 5>Beautiful Jab.</v>

4336
01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:45.990
<v Speaker 5>Dan does look a little bit,</v>

4337
01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:46.953
<v Speaker 5>it looks a little time.</v>

4338
01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:49.790
<v Speaker 5>I've got the power he could throw out</v>

4339
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:51.720
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>

4340
01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:52.800
<v Speaker 5>but it was a beautiful face,</v>

4341
01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:55.770
<v Speaker 5>beautiful thing to a leg kick and he showed it to him again.</v>

4342
01:57:55.771 --> 01:57:57.180
<v Speaker 5>Now he taxed with the inside.</v>

4343
01:57:57.180 --> 01:57:59.520
<v Speaker 5>I think Brisbane to win has to win these next three rounds.</v>

4344
01:57:59.521 --> 01:58:00.060
<v Speaker 5>Dan.</v>

4345
01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:01.770
<v Speaker 5>Dan Isn't can lose one of these rounds.</v>

4346
01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:02.011
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4347
01:58:02.011 --> 01:58:04.110
<v Speaker 5>Bisbee he's gotta be careful with that thing that he's doing.</v>

4348
01:58:04.230 --> 01:58:05.940
<v Speaker 5>He's doing this switch to the high kick,</v>

4349
01:58:05.941 --> 01:58:06.511
<v Speaker 5>but he's doing it.</v>

4350
01:58:06.511 --> 01:58:08.270
<v Speaker 5>He's dropping that left hand and a big way.</v>

4351
01:58:08.271 --> 01:58:08.360
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4352
01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:08.541
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4353
01:58:08.541 --> 01:58:12.540
<v Speaker 5>it keeps doing it and pull him biff Henderson Times that that switched to the</v>

4354
01:58:12.541 --> 01:58:13.021
<v Speaker 5>high kick.</v>

4355
01:58:13.021 --> 01:58:13.920
<v Speaker 5>If he's got it in them,</v>

4356
01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:15.750
<v Speaker 5>it's a matter of whether he's got it in a tank,</v>

4357
01:58:15.930 --> 01:58:18.870
<v Speaker 5>but he throws that step in looping right hand.</v>

4358
01:58:19.050 --> 01:58:21.060
<v Speaker 5>If he can time that switch to the high kick.</v>

4359
01:58:21.390 --> 01:58:22.890
<v Speaker 5>Bisbing can't get out of the way.</v>

4360
01:58:22.891 --> 01:58:24.150
<v Speaker 5>Once that legs and play,</v>

4361
01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:26.580
<v Speaker 5>he's all the way his legs up in the air and he's throwing,</v>

4362
01:58:26.581 --> 01:58:27.960
<v Speaker 5>especially when you're going high,</v>

4363
01:58:28.110 --> 01:58:31.470
<v Speaker 5>there's very little head moving is very little that you have left.</v>

4364
01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:33.510
<v Speaker 5>He's also timing his jab when he comes in,</v>

4365
01:58:33.511 --> 01:58:37.740
<v Speaker 5>that's all day and coming over the top Henderson's from like three punches.</v>

4366
01:58:37.741 --> 01:58:38.574
<v Speaker 5>This round,</v>

4367
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:40.740
<v Speaker 5>that punch.</v>

4368
01:58:41.710 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 5>That's</v>

4369
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:42.843
<v Speaker 2>all it.</v>

4370
01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:43.631
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4371
01:58:43.631 --> 01:58:44.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's capable.</v>

4372
01:58:44.690 --> 01:58:46.270
<v Speaker 2>Our tank is the power tank.</v>

4373
01:58:46.271 --> 01:58:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Just refueling.</v>

4374
01:58:47.630 --> 01:58:49.830
<v Speaker 2>I'll think he's capable of making those all.</v>

4375
01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:51.490
<v Speaker 2>He made the fake to the a new tab.</v>

4376
01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:53.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's capable of making those,</v>

4377
01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:56.200
<v Speaker 2>those rounds the way Bisping's fighting.</v>

4378
01:58:56.230 --> 01:58:57.063
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4379
01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:58.400
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

4380
01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:00.280
<v Speaker 2>he's just refueling that battery.</v>

4381
01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:00.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4382
01:59:00.671 --> 01:59:01.810
<v Speaker 2>He's like a video game.</v>

4383
01:59:01.811 --> 01:59:02.644
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>

4384
01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:03.513
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4385
01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:05.583
<v Speaker 2>Video game.</v>

4386
01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:06.371
<v Speaker 2>Is this right?</v>

4387
01:59:06.371 --> 01:59:07.840
<v Speaker 2>And actually known as the h bomb.</v>

4388
01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:08.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4389
01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:09.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4390
01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:10.890
<v Speaker 2>I think that's more,</v>

4391
01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:12.520
<v Speaker 2>we're now named it.</v>

4392
01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.310
<v Speaker 2>It looks like Dan slipped.</v>

4393
01:59:18.311 --> 01:59:19.144
<v Speaker 2>He landed.</v>

4394
01:59:19.810 --> 01:59:20.643
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4395
01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:21.971
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

4396
01:59:21.971 --> 01:59:22.804
<v Speaker 2>that's dangerous.</v>

4397
01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Definitely busy thing.</v>

4398
01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:28.060
<v Speaker 2>No matter what happens in the US and UK history,</v>

4399
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:30.460
<v Speaker 2>this forth for Horry.</v>

4400
01:59:30.461 --> 01:59:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4401
01:59:31.110 --> 01:59:31.451
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

4402
01:59:31.451 --> 01:59:34.060
<v Speaker 2>This did look at this number bigger and better than the UK.</v>

4403
01:59:34.090 --> 01:59:37.060
<v Speaker 2>The first round Henderson landed more because he has this thing dealing trouble</v>

4404
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:39.760
<v Speaker 2>like no one thinks that Bisping win the first round,</v>

4405
01:59:39.761 --> 01:59:39.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4406
01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:40.813
<v Speaker 2>Impossible.</v>

4407
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.781
<v Speaker 2>First round,</v>

4408
01:59:41.781 --> 01:59:44.160
<v Speaker 2>a hundred percent Henderson second round because they paid him off.</v>

4409
01:59:44.380 --> 01:59:45.040
<v Speaker 2>He looked great.</v>

4410
01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:46.060
<v Speaker 2>He looked great for a while,</v>

4411
01:59:46.061 --> 01:59:48.550
<v Speaker 2>but he got knocked down and almost finished at the end of the round.</v>

4412
01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:50.830
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the rug got taken over.</v>

4413
01:59:50.831 --> 01:59:51.664
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference.</v>

4414
01:59:52.070 --> 01:59:52.950
<v Speaker 2>Third round.</v>

4415
01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:53.853
<v Speaker 2>The third round.</v>

4416
01:59:54.670 --> 01:59:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4417
01:59:55.270 --> 01:59:56.103
<v Speaker 2>He's still got,</v>

4418
01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:57.250
<v Speaker 2>he's got to do is throw one.</v>

4419
01:59:57.290 --> 01:59:57.890
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

4420
01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:58.670
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

4421
01:59:58.670 --> 01:59:59.503
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

4422
01:59:59.620 --> 02:00:02.890
<v Speaker 2>None of this means daily hired two in business because it makes it a better</v>

4423
02:00:02.891 --> 02:00:03.310
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

4424
02:00:03.310 --> 02:00:04.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like a title.</v>

4425
02:00:04.181 --> 02:00:06.040
<v Speaker 2>It's bomb is right fucking there.</v>

4426
02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:07.000
<v Speaker 2>Look right there.</v>

4427
02:00:08.050 --> 02:00:08.883
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>

4428
02:00:08.930 --> 02:00:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Now powerful stiff kick by Dan.</v>

4429
02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:12.730
<v Speaker 2>Look for the high kicks.</v>

4430
02:00:14.150 --> 02:00:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Bisbee but now I see what they want the left cause mom's coming down.</v>

4431
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:21.670
<v Speaker 2>He smiled and he knows it.</v>

4432
02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:22.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4433
02:00:22.690 --> 02:00:23.560
<v Speaker 2>As long as he's standing,</v>

4434
02:00:23.561 --> 02:00:25.600
<v Speaker 2>no matter how wobbly he is,</v>

4435
02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:28.390
<v Speaker 2>remember fate or his fucking him up and then uh,</v>

4436
02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:29.171
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4437
02:00:29.171 --> 02:00:30.004
<v Speaker 2>then he</v>

4438
02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:32.080
<v Speaker 2>hit him.</v>

4439
02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Recite fader was winning.</v>

4440
02:00:35.620 --> 02:00:38.110
<v Speaker 2>He went up to dog fight control.</v>

4441
02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:39.400
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have the wizard.</v>

4442
02:00:39.401 --> 02:00:40.061
<v Speaker 2>He kept punching.</v>

4443
02:00:40.061 --> 02:00:42.290
<v Speaker 2>So he had his back and then</v>

4444
02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:47.020
<v Speaker 2>turned around quick install because of that wizard.</v>

4445
02:00:47.590 --> 02:00:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

4446
02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:50.260
<v Speaker 2>All because of a lack of wisdom.</v>

4447
02:00:50.290 --> 02:00:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Deep half guard.</v>

4448
02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4449
02:00:51.890 --> 02:00:55.930
<v Speaker 2>The lack of wisdom inside control with the under hook blasted up the dog fight</v>

4450
02:00:55.931 --> 02:00:56.830
<v Speaker 2>from side control.</v>

4451
02:00:56.890 --> 02:00:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

4452
02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:59.810
<v Speaker 2>They don't kept throwing punches when he should throw the wizard,</v>

4453
02:00:59.811 --> 02:01:00.760
<v Speaker 2>the wizard and back down.</v>

4454
02:01:00.761 --> 02:01:01.660
<v Speaker 2>But he kept throwing punches.</v>

4455
02:01:01.661 --> 02:01:04.750
<v Speaker 2>So he got his back and then he kind of face planted.</v>

4456
02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:05.411
<v Speaker 2>He was fine.</v>

4457
02:01:05.411 --> 02:01:05.861
<v Speaker 2>He was winning,</v>

4458
02:01:05.861 --> 02:01:06.694
<v Speaker 2>but he face planted.</v>

4459
02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:06.971
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4460
02:01:06.971 --> 02:01:08.290
<v Speaker 2>take a one second break.</v>

4461
02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:09.281
<v Speaker 2>But that position,</v>

4462
02:01:09.281 --> 02:01:10.480
<v Speaker 2>Damn Henderson was right there.</v>

4463
02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:13.030
<v Speaker 2>Well Henderson Henderson went,</v>

4464
02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:14.620
<v Speaker 2>I think he went for the deep half,</v>

4465
02:01:14.621 --> 02:01:15.760
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly.</v>

4466
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.250
<v Speaker 2>And he got here and then he threw an uppercut and he dropped like fate or like</v>

4467
02:01:20.251 --> 02:01:21.760
<v Speaker 2>face planted from the upper cut.</v>

4468
02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:24.520
<v Speaker 2>I think he scrambled and I think in the scramble,</v>

4469
02:01:24.521 --> 02:01:26.450
<v Speaker 2>Henderson landed a nasty uppercut as far as,</v>

4470
02:01:26.451 --> 02:01:27.370
<v Speaker 2>that's how I remember it.</v>

4471
02:01:27.371 --> 02:01:31.360
<v Speaker 2>And I knew went face plant had them inside control.</v>

4472
02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:35.590
<v Speaker 2>One side control beat comes down to the fourth round.</v>

4473
02:01:35.591 --> 02:01:36.160
<v Speaker 2>We're going and forth,</v>

4474
02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:37.090
<v Speaker 2>but we've got to pay attention to this.</v>

4475
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:39.170
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

4476
02:01:39.230 --> 02:01:40.460
<v Speaker 2>we'll watch it with watching for sure.</v>

4477
02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:41.391
<v Speaker 2>But here we go.</v>

4478
02:01:41.391 --> 02:01:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Forth this fine.</v>

4479
02:01:42.291 --> 02:01:43.250
<v Speaker 2>People were hating on it.</v>

4480
02:01:43.310 --> 02:01:43.491
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4481
02:01:43.491 --> 02:01:44.001
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>

4482
02:01:44.001 --> 02:01:44.691
<v Speaker 2>I loved this fire.</v>

4483
02:01:44.691 --> 02:01:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad they made it.</v>

4484
02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4485
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:47.210
<v Speaker 2>this is the fourth round.</v>

4486
02:01:47.211 --> 02:01:47.541
<v Speaker 2>Only.</v>

4487
02:01:47.541 --> 02:01:48.930
<v Speaker 2>Holy fucking shit.</v>

4488
02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:50.480
<v Speaker 2>Rockhold has gotta be home right now.</v>

4489
02:01:50.481 --> 02:01:50.811
<v Speaker 2>Calling.</v>

4490
02:01:50.811 --> 02:01:52.010
<v Speaker 2>What in the fuck?</v>

4491
02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:57.050
<v Speaker 2>How did I underestimate this dude gangster?</v>

4492
02:01:57.210 --> 02:01:58.790
<v Speaker 2>My topping is tough.</v>

4493
02:01:59.120 --> 02:01:59.751
<v Speaker 2>He's gangsters.</v>

4494
02:01:59.751 --> 02:02:01.310
<v Speaker 2>Fox until two on Henderson.</v>

4495
02:02:02.710 --> 02:02:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4496
02:02:03.230 --> 02:02:03.951
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

4497
02:02:03.951 --> 02:02:04.641
<v Speaker 2>We're in England.</v>

4498
02:02:04.641 --> 02:02:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Who knows who's judging?</v>

4499
02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:06.621
<v Speaker 2>Who's you know.</v>

4500
02:02:06.621 --> 02:02:07.580
<v Speaker 2>I would agree with you.</v>

4501
02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:08.433
<v Speaker 2>He wanted the last one.</v>

4502
02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:11.800
<v Speaker 2>He's today one in my book under buddy.</v>

4503
02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:12.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm with Eddie.</v>

4504
02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:13.370
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>

4505
02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:17.320
<v Speaker 2>it could be two to one or someone might have made the second round and even</v>

4506
02:02:17.330 --> 02:02:22.330
<v Speaker 2>round may have gave that last round to Dan Henderson to praise.</v>

4507
02:02:25.810 --> 02:02:27.740
<v Speaker 2>Our second was an inside job.</v>

4508
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Here goes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Charlie Brown kids.</v>

4548
02:03:34.450 --> 02:03:36.980
<v Speaker 2>So weird that you're not allowed to target the joint with a strike,</v>

4549
02:03:36.981 --> 02:03:37.731
<v Speaker 2>but you're allowed to heal.</v>

4550
02:03:37.731 --> 02:03:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Hook somebody.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

4555
02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:44.811
<v Speaker 2>but you can heal.</v>

4556
02:03:44.811 --> 02:03:48.270
<v Speaker 2>Hook them who and rip his fucking Nia parts cause you can't front kick the knee</v>

4557
02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:49.183
<v Speaker 2>in some states.</v>

4558
02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Some states have rules against attacking the joy.</v>

4559
02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:52.520
<v Speaker 2>What I've just done,</v>

4560
02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:53.650
<v Speaker 2>their low most retarded,</v>

4561
02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:55.640
<v Speaker 2>rather another local arrest.</v>

4562
02:03:55.660 --> 02:03:56.493
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

4563
02:03:57.990 --> 02:04:00.260
<v Speaker 2>these are sacred heads.</v>

4564
02:04:00.261 --> 02:04:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4565
02:04:00.590 --> 02:04:01.710
<v Speaker 2>Not the sacredness.</v>

4566
02:04:01.850 --> 02:04:02.381
<v Speaker 2>Dan's a pro.</v>

4567
02:04:02.381 --> 02:04:06.890
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna take some time for 59 he's a pro.</v>

4568
02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:08.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4569
02:04:08.211 --> 02:04:10.010
<v Speaker 2>he got cracked the second time of the fight.</v>

4570
02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:10.960

02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:15.391
<v Speaker 2>he's got,</v>

4574
02:04:15.391 --> 02:04:17.110
<v Speaker 2>but he's going to take it move.</v>

4575
02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:19.520
<v Speaker 2>That's what your fucking head have in big balls.</v>

4576
02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:20.001
<v Speaker 2>Now here's,</v>

4577
02:04:20.001 --> 02:04:20.810
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you this.</v>

4578
02:04:20.810 --> 02:04:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they should be able to work on Michael Bisping's eye while Dan</v>

4579
02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Henderson is a is sitting there recovering like,</v>

4580
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:26.151
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4581
02:04:26.151 --> 02:04:27.810
<v Speaker 2>it's an APP so foul.</v>

4582
02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Would it be nice if he could see a little bit better?</v>

4583
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4584
02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:31.293
<v Speaker 2>that would be bullshit.</v>

4585
02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:31.911
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4586
02:04:31.911 --> 02:04:32.900
<v Speaker 2>it's just time off.</v>

4587
02:04:33.050 --> 02:04:33.890
<v Speaker 2>It's just an eye.</v>

4588
02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Is he going to go back?</v>

4589
02:04:35.150 --> 02:04:37.120
<v Speaker 2>I was going to take the time taking.</v>

4590

<v Speaker 2>He's going to do the full five east 46 the UFC a massage.</v>

4591
02:04:43.051 --> 02:04:43.884
<v Speaker 2>The balls.</v>

4592
02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:44.813
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't help.</v>

4593
02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:46.153
<v Speaker 2>It just makes them hurt.</v>

4594
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:46.861
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>

4595
02:04:46.861 --> 02:04:47.694
<v Speaker 2>It helps.</v>

4596
02:04:48.630 --> 02:04:49.350
<v Speaker 2>No matter what.</v>

4597
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:52.310
<v Speaker 2>This tells the plane goes away.</v>

4598
02:04:52.350 --> 02:04:53.620
<v Speaker 2>See that he's stuffing.</v>

4599
02:04:53.670 --> 02:04:55.200
<v Speaker 2>They kind of shake that ball down.</v>

4600
02:04:55.530 --> 02:04:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if that was the job of like one girl,</v>

4601
02:04:58.890 --> 02:05:00.030
<v Speaker 2>like this one girl was just like,</v>

4602
02:05:00.070 --> 02:05:01.980
<v Speaker 2>she hasn't met the jihad ball massage.</v>

4603
02:05:01.981 --> 02:05:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Now it's about the technique.</v>

4604
02:05:04.620 --> 02:05:05.010
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

4605
02:05:05.010 --> 02:05:05.720
<v Speaker 2>what does my watches,</v>

4606
02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:07.680
<v Speaker 2>things like who cares if she has fake tits?</v>

4607
02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Michael Bisping is complaining.</v>

4608
02:05:09.511 --> 02:05:10.980
<v Speaker 2>The Dan Henderson is milking it.</v>

4609
02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:13.620
<v Speaker 2>You started clapping and pointing to him.</v>

4610
02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:15.150
<v Speaker 2>He's still taking his guys.</v>

4611
02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:16.021
<v Speaker 2>He's a pro.</v>

4612
02:05:16.021 --> 02:05:18.060
<v Speaker 2>Dan Henderson is milking this.</v>

4613
02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:19.140
<v Speaker 2>He's a pro.</v>

4614
02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

4615
02:05:19.450 --> 02:05:22.500
<v Speaker 2>They don't know if that one we go perfect timing this.</v>

4616
02:05:22.501 --> 02:05:24.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have a psyche connection to Dan Henderson.</v>

4617
02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:25.713
<v Speaker 2>If you're back,</v>

4618
02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:27.300
<v Speaker 2>you're back from the can.</v>

4619
02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:30.870
<v Speaker 2>I know of that when I see it as it gives live time.</v>

4620
02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:31.771
<v Speaker 2>He used it.</v>

4621
02:05:31.771 --> 02:05:32.280
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

4622
02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:33.390
<v Speaker 2>How long do you think you waited?</v>

4623
02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:36.660
<v Speaker 2>Two minutes or three minutes maybe even maybe.</v>

4624
02:05:36.661 --> 02:05:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4625
02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:38.400
<v Speaker 2>You got three rounds rests.</v>

4626
02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:39.420
<v Speaker 2>That's a big rest.</v>

4627
02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:45.510
<v Speaker 2>4,600 of those cups where they make a mold of your fucking Dick and your balls</v>

4628
02:05:46.230 --> 02:05:47.610
<v Speaker 2>and I hear about those every day.</v>

4629
02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:49.081
<v Speaker 2>No circles.</v>

4630
02:05:49.081 --> 02:05:49.914
<v Speaker 2>I travel</v>

4631
02:05:51.330 --> 02:05:55.950
<v Speaker 2>and make got mold of you fucking package and they make a cup around your</v>

4632
02:05:55.990 --> 02:05:56.823
<v Speaker 2>packets.</v>

4633
02:05:57.090 --> 02:05:57.923
<v Speaker 2>Let's watch the fight.</v>

4634
02:05:58.020 --> 02:05:58.620
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4635
02:05:58.620 --> 02:06:01.800
<v Speaker 2>two 18 and keep track of what Dan does after that long break,</v>

4636
02:06:02.160 --> 02:06:03.010
<v Speaker 2>he's going to drop skin.</v>

4637
02:06:03.020 --> 02:06:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Ask serious right hand,</v>

4638
02:06:04.590 --> 02:06:05.700
<v Speaker 2>serious recovery.</v>

4639
02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:07.053
<v Speaker 2>That's a long,</v>

4640
02:06:07.630 --> 02:06:09.990
<v Speaker 2>that was the left.</v>

4641
02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:10.530
<v Speaker 2>We have that.</v>

4642
02:06:10.530 --> 02:06:12.450
<v Speaker 2>The lack of flexibility in that leg kick.</v>

4643
02:06:12.451 --> 02:06:13.970
<v Speaker 2>That's on Charlie Brown cakes.</v>

4644
02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:16.220
<v Speaker 2>World class level I think.</v>

4645
02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

4646
02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:17.641
<v Speaker 2>And he had kicked,</v>

4647
02:06:17.641 --> 02:06:19.060
<v Speaker 2>he had kicked back to the lumbar with that.</v>

4648
02:06:19.210 --> 02:06:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Sure as hell did.</v>

4649
02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh good job.</v>

4650
02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:23.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

4651
02:06:23.490 --> 02:06:24.780
<v Speaker 2>You give him two minute Rasta,</v>

4652
02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:25.620
<v Speaker 2>he fucked up.</v>

4653
02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:27.030
<v Speaker 2>He had kicked lumbered with the right.</v>

4654
02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:30.180
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if Dan Henderson was knocking fools out like in junior high.</v>

4655
02:06:30.450 --> 02:06:30.891
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

4656
02:06:30.891 --> 02:06:31.724
<v Speaker 2>Raise your rates.</v>

4657
02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:33.240
<v Speaker 2>Here's what everybody forgets.</v>

4658
02:06:33.570 --> 02:06:34.403
<v Speaker 2>Everybody forgets.</v>

4659
02:06:34.410 --> 02:06:35.940
<v Speaker 2>They used to call him decision.</v>

4660
02:06:35.941 --> 02:06:36.774
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

4661
02:06:36.850 --> 02:06:37.710
<v Speaker 2>he forgets this.</v>

4662
02:06:37.711 --> 02:06:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4663
02:06:38.190 --> 02:06:40.290
<v Speaker 2>I did a whole piece about this for the UFC recently.</v>

4664
02:06:40.590 --> 02:06:45.360
<v Speaker 2>That it wasn't until 2003 it was when he knocked out my real Bustamante.</v>

4665
02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:49.140
<v Speaker 2>He knocked out Marula Bustamante and everybody knew that he had power.</v>

4666
02:06:49.170 --> 02:06:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Like remember he fucked up Vandelay he hurt his eye.</v>

4667
02:06:51.420 --> 02:06:54.720
<v Speaker 2>I think that was 2001 if I remember correctly in pride.</v>

4668
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:58.740
<v Speaker 2>But around the Marillo Bustamonte fight,</v>

4669
02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:01.860
<v Speaker 2>he started realizing he could Merck motherfuckers.</v>

4670
02:07:02.130 --> 02:07:07.130
<v Speaker 2>So he started really like throwing all his power into shots as something changed</v>

4671
02:07:07.951 --> 02:07:12.210
<v Speaker 2>in Dan Henderson's fight style because now everybody knows him has one of the</v>

4672
02:07:12.211 --> 02:07:14.370
<v Speaker 2>most dangerous knockout punches ever.</v>

4673
02:07:14.610 --> 02:07:18.480
<v Speaker 2>But they used to call them decision Dan on the underground.</v>

4674
02:07:18.481 --> 02:07:19.440
<v Speaker 2>That was his nickname.</v>

4675
02:07:19.441 --> 02:07:20.390
<v Speaker 2>Riddick Bowe had this,</v>

4676
02:07:20.530 --> 02:07:23.190
<v Speaker 2>went through the same thing Riddick Bowe never knocked anybody had in the</v>

4677
02:07:23.191 --> 02:07:23.800
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>

4678
02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:25.320
<v Speaker 2>And then when he was criticized about that,</v>

4679
02:07:25.321 --> 02:07:26.340
<v Speaker 2>then he started fucking people.</v>

4680
02:07:26.341 --> 02:07:27.031
<v Speaker 2>That's a little different.</v>

4681
02:07:27.031 --> 02:07:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Cause Dan,</v>

4682
02:07:27.590 --> 02:07:29.610
<v Speaker 2>you know with his worldclass wrestling back on,</v>

4683
02:07:29.611 --> 02:07:31.550
<v Speaker 2>he's just decision guys using these grappling.</v>

4684
02:07:31.850 --> 02:07:32.430
<v Speaker 2>They freak out.</v>

4685
02:07:32.430 --> 02:07:32.851
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

4686
02:07:32.851 --> 02:07:33.211
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

4687
02:07:33.211 --> 02:07:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Hand is from God.</v>

4688
02:07:34.140 --> 02:07:34.960
<v Speaker 2>Check this out.</v>

4689
02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:35.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4690
02:07:35.351 --> 02:07:36.130
<v Speaker 2>Also different</v>

4691
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:38.470
<v Speaker 5>because there's only one thing that correct.</v>

4692
02:07:38.570 --> 02:07:39.070
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4693
02:07:39.070 --> 02:07:40.670
<v Speaker 5>I mean we're,</v>

4694
02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:41.590
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about,</v>

4695
02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:43.391
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

4696
02:07:43.391 --> 02:07:43.781
<v Speaker 5>look at this.</v>

4697
02:07:43.781 --> 02:07:44.950
<v Speaker 5>When Riddick Bowe was fighting,</v>

4698
02:07:44.951 --> 02:07:46.090
<v Speaker 5>he was just boxing.</v>

4699
02:07:46.210 --> 02:07:49.510
<v Speaker 5>Now Dan learned how to strike while he was MMA fighting.</v>

4700
02:07:49.511 --> 02:07:50.230
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

4701
02:07:50.230 --> 02:07:52.660
<v Speaker 5>Learn how to just drop Haymac cause I came into it.</v>

4702
02:07:52.661 --> 02:07:54.040
<v Speaker 5>Just a straight wrestler.</v>

4703
02:07:54.070 --> 02:07:54.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4704
02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:55.770
<v Speaker 5>Look at Biz being thrown.</v>

4705
02:07:55.780 --> 02:07:56.380
<v Speaker 5>Sidekicks,</v>

4706
02:07:56.380 --> 02:07:57.213
<v Speaker 5>you the neat</v>

4707
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.291
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

4708
02:07:59.291 --> 02:08:02.500
<v Speaker 5>I came in to get appointment that I swelled up real proper.</v>

4709
02:08:02.660 --> 02:08:06.910
<v Speaker 5>Well Bisping has a background in traditional martial arts and a lot of people</v>

4710
02:08:06.911 --> 02:08:07.541
<v Speaker 5>forget that.</v>

4711
02:08:07.541 --> 02:08:08.890
<v Speaker 5>Like he's a really good kicker.</v>

4712
02:08:09.140 --> 02:08:14.140
<v Speaker 5>It didn't happen at like 17 I'm not surprised as good karate to head.</v>

4713
02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:17.610
<v Speaker 5>Is it two around?</v>

4714
02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:18.461
<v Speaker 5>Is it to,</v>

4715
02:08:18.461 --> 02:08:19.690
<v Speaker 5>to who won that round?</v>

4716
02:08:19.870 --> 02:08:20.350
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

4717
02:08:20.350 --> 02:08:21.550
<v Speaker 5>Got To give that to best pattern.</v>

4718
02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:22.720
<v Speaker 5>No volume.</v>

4719
02:08:22.721 --> 02:08:23.650
<v Speaker 5>What did Henderson do?</v>

4720
02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:26.200
<v Speaker 5>He landed a few left jabs.</v>

4721
02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:26.681
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4722
02:08:26.681 --> 02:08:30.280
<v Speaker 5>But the volume of strikes and overall you've got to give it to best bang.</v>

4723
02:08:30.490 --> 02:08:32.470
<v Speaker 5>So this might be the deciding right now.</v>

4724
02:08:32.530 --> 02:08:33.363
<v Speaker 5>This is crazy.</v>

4725
02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:34.900
<v Speaker 5>Empathy's Cardio's insane.</v>

4726
02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:35.980
<v Speaker 5>I would assume.</v>

4727
02:08:36.430 --> 02:08:38.380
<v Speaker 5>I think bisman puts on a flurry here,</v>

4728
02:08:38.381 --> 02:08:38.581
<v Speaker 5>but he's,</v>

4729
02:08:38.581 --> 02:08:40.660
<v Speaker 5>he'll open himself up to a huge right hand maybe.</v>

4730
02:08:40.750 --> 02:08:41.021
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

4731
02:08:41.021 --> 02:08:42.340
<v Speaker 5>so the second round is,</v>

4732
02:08:42.341 --> 02:08:43.080
<v Speaker 5>well here you go.</v>

4733
02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:47.290
<v Speaker 5>Do the Henderson did not fight hard at the end of the round after he came back</v>

4734
02:08:47.291 --> 02:08:48.310
<v Speaker 5>after taking that break,</v>

4735
02:08:48.460 --> 02:08:50.380
<v Speaker 5>some of that might've been part of his strategy.</v>

4736
02:08:50.381 --> 02:08:50.981
<v Speaker 5>He might've said,</v>

4737
02:08:50.981 --> 02:08:51.191
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

4738
02:08:51.191 --> 02:08:52.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to take this big gray the fifth I'm going to.</v>

4739
02:08:52.931 --> 02:08:53.291
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4740
02:08:53.291 --> 02:08:53.621
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

4741
02:08:53.621 --> 02:08:53.890
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4742
02:08:53.890 --> 02:08:58.240
<v Speaker 5>this is a really smart move because I'll have a deep gas tank in the fifth round</v>

4743
02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:02.410
<v Speaker 5>and it's his last round of his career and have since last name.</v>

4744
02:09:02.590 --> 02:09:03.700
<v Speaker 5>That's what he's been saying.</v>

4745
02:09:03.701 --> 02:09:04.211
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4746
02:09:04.211 --> 02:09:05.140
<v Speaker 5>But I would say that too,</v>

4747
02:09:05.141 --> 02:09:07.960
<v Speaker 5>if I was trying to renegotiate my contract as the middleweight champion of the</v>

4748
02:09:07.961 --> 02:09:08.530
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

4749
02:09:08.530 --> 02:09:10.060
<v Speaker 5>but Bisbing is at home.</v>

4750
02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:10.960
<v Speaker 5>I got a good idea.</v>

4751
02:09:10.961 --> 02:09:11.794
<v Speaker 5>I bet he's done.</v>

4752
02:09:12.130 --> 02:09:13.180
<v Speaker 5>He might be done,</v>

4753
02:09:13.210 --> 02:09:16.170
<v Speaker 5>but why he's your cyber fire to the restaurant.</v>

4754
02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:17.033
<v Speaker 5>Go,</v>

4755
02:09:17.110 --> 02:09:17.943
<v Speaker 5>come on baby.</v>

4756
02:09:18.070 --> 02:09:18.800
<v Speaker 5>Come on baby.</v>

4757
02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:20.260
<v Speaker 5>You ever see Dan Henderson fight?</v>

4758
02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:21.940
<v Speaker 5>This is a big five minutes.</v>

4759
02:09:21.970 --> 02:09:23.100
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah,</v>

4760
02:09:23.300 --> 02:09:24.133
<v Speaker 5>me go.</v>

4761
02:09:24.190 --> 02:09:24.671
<v Speaker 5>Here we go.</v>

4762
02:09:24.671 --> 02:09:25.600
<v Speaker 5>The legend.</v>

4763
02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:26.741
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4764
02:09:26.741 --> 02:09:27.610
<v Speaker 5>If he wins this fight,</v>

4765
02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:30.040
<v Speaker 5>he arguably has the greatest career of all time.</v>

4766
02:09:30.070 --> 02:09:30.970
<v Speaker 5>Let's think about that.</v>

4767
02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:31.880
<v Speaker 5>What's on the line?</v>

4768
02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:32.980
<v Speaker 5>This next strike force.</v>

4769
02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.491
<v Speaker 5>UFC.</v>

4770
02:09:33.491 --> 02:09:33.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4771
02:09:33.850 --> 02:09:37.990
<v Speaker 5>Two two titles simultaneously and prides Strikeforce title knocked out Faye</v>

4772
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:38.230
<v Speaker 5>Door,</v>

4773
02:09:38.230 --> 02:09:43.230
<v Speaker 5>knocked out Hector Lombard in his last fight and at 46 years old if he could</v>

4774
02:09:43.601 --> 02:09:44.050
<v Speaker 5>win.</v>

4775
02:09:44.050 --> 02:09:45.910
<v Speaker 5>It's arguably as the greatest career of all time.</v>

4776
02:09:45.911 --> 02:09:46.744
<v Speaker 5>Look at Bisping.</v>

4777
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:50.860
<v Speaker 5>He's looking at an Olympic medal,</v>

4778
02:09:50.861 --> 02:09:51.560
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4779
02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:51.860
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4780
02:09:51.860 --> 02:09:52.140
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4781
02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:52.271
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4782
02:09:52.271 --> 02:09:53.104
<v Speaker 5>He was silver.</v>

4783
02:09:53.230 --> 02:09:53.860
<v Speaker 5>Silver,</v>

4784
02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:54.730
<v Speaker 5>silver in the Olympics.</v>

4785
02:09:54.731 --> 02:09:55.564
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4786
02:09:56.050 --> 02:09:56.920
<v Speaker 5>that's a career.</v>

4787
02:09:57.040 --> 02:09:57.610
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

4788
02:09:57.610 --> 02:09:58.100
<v Speaker 5>Oh He's,</v>

4789
02:09:58.100 --> 02:09:59.290
<v Speaker 5>he's on the Mount Rushmore.</v>

4790
02:09:59.320 --> 02:09:59.441
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4791
02:09:59.441 --> 02:10:00.430
<v Speaker 5>100% for sure.</v>

4792
02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:01.560
<v Speaker 5>If legends second.</v>

4793
02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:04.810
<v Speaker 5>The first guy I was there for his first fight in the UFC in 1996.</v>

4794
02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:05.321
<v Speaker 5>Damn,</v>

4795
02:10:05.321 --> 02:10:06.154
<v Speaker 5>that's old school.</v>

4796
02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:07.751
<v Speaker 5>Remember he fought frank.</v>

4797
02:10:07.751 --> 02:10:10.290
<v Speaker 5>She said 96 why does this no six?</v>

4798
02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:10.841
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4799
02:10:10.841 --> 02:10:13.030
<v Speaker 5>it couldn't have been 96 because my first uh,</v>

4800
02:10:13.060 --> 02:10:14.920
<v Speaker 5>time in the UFC was in 97.</v>

4801
02:10:15.580 --> 02:10:17.740
<v Speaker 5>So it must have been 97 or 98.</v>

4802
02:10:17.770 --> 02:10:17.940
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

4803
02:10:17.940 --> 02:10:20.290
<v Speaker 5>I think you're writing about him saving for this last round.</v>

4804
02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:21.153
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4805
02:10:21.190 --> 02:10:21.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4806
02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:22.780
<v Speaker 5>Well that's what a veteran would do,</v>

4807
02:10:23.170 --> 02:10:23.560
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4808
02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:24.640
<v Speaker 5>You got that three minutes.</v>

4809
02:10:24.641 --> 02:10:27.880
<v Speaker 5>Let's just skate for the next and try to blow them out.</v>

4810
02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:28.893
<v Speaker 5>What year was,</v>

4811
02:10:28.990 --> 02:10:29.560
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4812
02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:30.393
<v Speaker 5>powerful memory.</v>

4813
02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:31.061
<v Speaker 5>98.</v>

4814
02:10:31.061 --> 02:10:31.370
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

4815
02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 5>98 [inaudible] 97 open 98</v>

4816
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:34.330
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

4817
02:10:34.330 --> 02:10:35.163
<v Speaker 2>Ryan goes,</v>

4818
02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:35.331
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4819
02:10:35.331 --> 02:10:35.751
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

4820
02:10:35.751 --> 02:10:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Allen goes very controversial.</v>

4821
02:10:37.251 --> 02:10:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Descend on unanimous decision.</v>

4822
02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4823
02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:41.780
<v Speaker 2>have you ever seen Alan goes versus Frank Shamrock?</v>

4824
02:10:41.810 --> 02:10:42.643
<v Speaker 2>Sure haven't.</v>

4825
02:10:42.770 --> 02:10:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

4826
02:10:43.190 --> 02:10:44.270
<v Speaker 2>That was in pancreas.</v>

4827
02:10:44.271 --> 02:10:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Palm strikes only.</v>

4828
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Watch that show.</v>

4829
02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:47.140
<v Speaker 2>I'll never met at pawn.</v>

4830
02:10:47.150 --> 02:10:47.870
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

4831
02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

4832
02:10:48.650 --> 02:10:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Three 36 this is big.</v>

4833
02:10:52.250 --> 02:10:53.090
<v Speaker 2>This is huge.</v>

4834
02:10:53.250 --> 02:10:54.083
<v Speaker 2>Come on baby.</v>

4835
02:10:55.370 --> 02:10:55.810
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

4836
02:10:55.810 --> 02:10:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

4837
02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:57.670
<v Speaker 2>nice combination.</v>

4838
02:10:57.850 --> 02:10:59.650
<v Speaker 2>See when you're looking at sheer volume,</v>

4839
02:10:59.651 --> 02:11:00.750
<v Speaker 2>Bisping's got a big leaguer.</v>

4840
02:11:00.751 --> 02:11:01.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4841
02:11:01.390 --> 02:11:02.120
<v Speaker 2>And see the,</v>

4842
02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:07.120
<v Speaker 2>there's an argument to be said for breaking fights up in rounds is not wise,</v>

4843
02:11:07.750 --> 02:11:10.870
<v Speaker 2>and that the wise way to judge a fight is to give them rounds,</v>

4844
02:11:10.871 --> 02:11:12.820
<v Speaker 2>but judge the fight as a whole,</v>

4845
02:11:13.150 --> 02:11:14.260
<v Speaker 2>that's what pride did.</v>

4846
02:11:14.261 --> 02:11:19.261
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the more effective God that was like uh,</v>

4847
02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:20.710
<v Speaker 2>like he's got some kind of,</v>

4848
02:11:20.850 --> 02:11:22.620
<v Speaker 2>he's like the guru reefer with last shit.</v>

4849
02:11:22.740 --> 02:11:24.280
<v Speaker 2>It's just comes down to the power.</v>

4850
02:11:24.970 --> 02:11:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous crouch.</v>

4851
02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:27.100
<v Speaker 2>What are those blades called?</v>

4852
02:11:27.101 --> 02:11:27.934
<v Speaker 2>Sickles.</v>

4853
02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4854
02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4855
02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Blocked that left high kick.</v>

4856
02:11:31.610 --> 02:11:32.260
<v Speaker 2>Kick has him in.</v>

4857
02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:37.090
<v Speaker 2>I think that we have a flawed system and a guy being able to win around and then</v>

4858
02:11:37.091 --> 02:11:38.170
<v Speaker 2>went around and,</v>

4859
02:11:38.530 --> 02:11:43.360
<v Speaker 2>and then a couple rounds later he gets almost finished and the fight ends with</v>

4860
02:11:43.361 --> 02:11:45.490
<v Speaker 2>him being almost finished but yet he could still win.</v>

4861
02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:47.590
<v Speaker 2>Cause cause you're saying cause that guy won the fight.</v>

4862
02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:49.000
<v Speaker 2>The other guy won on the card.</v>

4863
02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:50.560
<v Speaker 2>He won the game.</v>

4864
02:11:50.590 --> 02:11:51.400
<v Speaker 2>How about knockout?</v>

4865
02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Only MMA like you own wholly knockout or submission or some imagined it's</v>

4866
02:11:56.291 --> 02:11:57.480
<v Speaker 2>finished has agreed to that</v>

4867
02:11:59.340 --> 02:12:00.173
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

4868
02:12:00.370 --> 02:12:00.931
<v Speaker 2>You keep going,</v>

4869
02:12:00.931 --> 02:12:01.830
<v Speaker 2>you over time around.</v>

4870
02:12:01.831 --> 02:12:04.090
<v Speaker 2>So someone gets finished and you do it in a football field.</v>

4871
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.720
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4872
02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Let's do you want to do it?</v>

4873
02:12:05.580 --> 02:12:06.700
<v Speaker 2>How is it all down to</v>

4874
02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:09.653
<v Speaker 2>dog?</v>

4875
02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:11.920
<v Speaker 2>Don't make this shit happen.</v>

4876
02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Reservation.</v>

4877
02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4878
02:12:14.170 --> 02:12:14.910
<v Speaker 2>we're going to call it.</v>

4879
02:12:14.910 --> 02:12:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh left Pittsburgh with a beautiful right left and right there.</v>

4880
02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:22.541
<v Speaker 2>Nice Jab.</v>

4881
02:12:22.541 --> 02:12:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Is there already an RFC?</v>

4882
02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:24.663
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4883
02:12:24.700 --> 02:12:24.941
<v Speaker 2>nice.</v>

4884
02:12:24.941 --> 02:12:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Inside leg kick by Dan.</v>

4885
02:12:26.890 --> 02:12:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Probably reality fighting championships.</v>

4886
02:12:28.781 --> 02:12:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't that something?</v>

4887
02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Fight companion championships.</v>

4888
02:12:32.050 --> 02:12:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Just to call it the Rogan fight league if I can paint championships is good.</v>

4889
02:12:35.590 --> 02:12:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4890
02:12:36.010 --> 02:12:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

4891
02:12:36.340 --> 02:12:36.640
<v Speaker 2>The wheat.</v>

4892
02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

4893
02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4894
02:12:38.050 --> 02:12:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Henderson with the right.</v>

4895
02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Careful over there.</v>

4896
02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:40.601
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

4897
02:12:40.601 --> 02:12:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Careful in that cage is being one 43 degrees.</v>

4898
02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:44.110
<v Speaker 2>The crowd's going nuts.</v>

4899
02:12:44.380 --> 02:12:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Take some down.</v>

4900
02:12:46.180 --> 02:12:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>

4901
02:12:47.530 --> 02:12:48.370
<v Speaker 2>He's got his back,</v>

4902
02:12:48.371 --> 02:12:48.670
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

4903
02:12:48.670 --> 02:12:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

4904
02:12:50.260 --> 02:12:52.720
<v Speaker 2>He's going to get a knee bar is going to roll for knee bar.</v>

4905
02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:53.081
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

4906
02:12:53.081 --> 02:12:55.580
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are you just down looking at the Greco Roman?</v>

4907
02:12:55.581 --> 02:12:57.490
<v Speaker 2>He's about to do some nasty ground and pound him.</v>

4908
02:12:58.270 --> 02:12:58.720
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

4909
02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Did [inaudible] not gone into effect yet,</v>

4910
02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:01.950
<v Speaker 2>honey?</v>

4911
02:13:01.950 --> 02:13:02.980
<v Speaker 2>We got on the ground,</v>

4912
02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:03.873
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

4913
02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:05.373
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

4914
02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

4915
02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:09.033
<v Speaker 2>One seven two,</v>

4916
02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:10.113
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

4917
02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:14.980
<v Speaker 2>one big deep breaths and Bisping's got that crazy cardio</v>

4918
02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:16.190
<v Speaker 7>really quick.</v>

4919
02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:18.350
<v Speaker 2>They both look a little dude.</v>

4920
02:13:18.351 --> 02:13:19.184
<v Speaker 2>What does that decision,</v>

4921
02:13:19.270 --> 02:13:20.870
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful Jab in England.</v>

4922
02:13:22.730 --> 02:13:23.390
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

4923
02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:26.960
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be mad at a busy being decision in England,</v>

4924
02:13:27.050 --> 02:13:29.930
<v Speaker 2>but I guarantee you the UFC brought their own judges.</v>

4925
02:13:30.350 --> 02:13:30.890
<v Speaker 2>You think?</v>

4926
02:13:30.890 --> 02:13:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

4927
02:13:31.650 --> 02:13:32.310
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine</v>

4928
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:33.560
<v Speaker 1>a bird out of badging.</v>

4929
02:13:33.630 --> 02:13:33.811
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4930
02:13:33.811 --> 02:13:34.644
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

4931
02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine you can't really rely on the local judges.</v>

4932
02:13:39.630 --> 02:13:42.290
<v Speaker 1>I can't rely on the American judge.</v>

4933
02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:43.370
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

4934
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:45.780
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to take him down.</v>

4935
02:13:45.870 --> 02:13:46.531
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4936
02:13:46.531 --> 02:13:47.670
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make them look good.</v>

4937
02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:49.500
<v Speaker 1>He's going to lose this round.</v>

4938
02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4939
02:13:50.550 --> 02:13:51.570
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily.</v>

4940
02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:55.770
<v Speaker 1>There's still 32 seconds of hammertime possibly.</v>

4941
02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:57.143
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

4942
02:13:57.240 --> 02:13:59.460
<v Speaker 1>He's landed more strikes in the last three rounds.</v>

4943
02:14:00.150 --> 02:14:00.983
<v Speaker 1>That's what it says.</v>

4944
02:14:02.210 --> 02:14:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

4945
02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:03.300
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

4946
02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Then the last significant one to ten eight left.</v>

4947
02:14:08.430 --> 02:14:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that one gotta be a tenant?</v>

4948
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I would say so for sure.</v>

4949
02:14:11.250 --> 02:14:12.300
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a draw then.</v>

4950
02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows?</v>

4951
02:14:13.501 --> 02:14:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4952
02:14:13.770 --> 02:14:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Trial.</v>

4953
02:14:14.180 --> 02:14:15.070
<v Speaker 1>We still don't have exact.</v>

4954
02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Tends to draw from rare.</v>

4955
02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:17.730
<v Speaker 1>They get this.</v>

4956
02:14:19.860 --> 02:14:20.670
<v Speaker 1>How much time?</v>

4957
02:14:20.670 --> 02:14:21.450
<v Speaker 1>10 seconds.</v>

4958
02:14:21.450 --> 02:14:25.630
<v Speaker 1>No Fun events over to Cartwheel kick when we volume ends.</v>

4959
02:14:25.631 --> 02:14:26.490
<v Speaker 1>The fight on his back.</v>

4960
02:14:26.491 --> 02:14:27.150
<v Speaker 1>That ain't good.</v>

4961
02:14:27.150 --> 02:14:27.720
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4962
02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Terrible.</v>

4963
02:14:28.330 --> 02:14:29.300
<v Speaker 1>His big might.</v>

4964
02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:31.260
<v Speaker 1>This decision that he got it.</v>

4965
02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:32.011
<v Speaker 1>He might've.</v>

4966
02:14:32.011 --> 02:14:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Why don't I bet he going to be a drone.</v>

4967
02:14:33.571 --> 02:14:35.010
<v Speaker 1>You can one the last three rounds,</v>

4968
02:14:35.011 --> 02:14:36.630
<v Speaker 1>but the first round with a ten eight draw.</v>

4969
02:14:37.380 --> 02:14:38.213
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

4970
02:14:38.370 --> 02:14:39.210
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't do a draw.</v>

4971
02:14:39.270 --> 02:14:39.691
<v Speaker 1>It's done.</v>

4972
02:14:39.691 --> 02:14:41.910
<v Speaker 1>We could turn it off now start talking about RFC.</v>

4973
02:14:43.590 --> 02:14:44.091
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4974
02:14:44.091 --> 02:14:45.600
<v Speaker 1>we were going to talk about something.</v>

4975
02:14:46.170 --> 02:14:46.411
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

4976
02:14:46.411 --> 02:14:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Fight.</v>

4977
02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:47.011
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4978
02:14:47.011 --> 02:14:49.950
<v Speaker 1>fader door and Dan Henderson pull up the fader and Dan Henderson,</v>

4979
02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:50.813
<v Speaker 1>cause</v>

4980
02:14:52.710 --> 02:14:53.341
<v Speaker 1>this is what I think,</v>

4981
02:14:53.341 --> 02:14:55.200
<v Speaker 1>I think Fado was on top ground and pound in.</v>

4982
02:14:55.201 --> 02:14:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Henderson went to deep half.</v>

4983
02:14:56.820 --> 02:14:57.930
<v Speaker 1>He reversed him,</v>

4984
02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:00.120
<v Speaker 1>got into a position where he's on his back and he did.</v>

4985
02:15:00.121 --> 02:15:04.080
<v Speaker 1>When the upper cut and flat faced a fatal I,</v>

4986
02:15:04.140 --> 02:15:05.370
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what happened.</v>

4987
02:15:05.370 --> 02:15:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Then he finished off with ground and potato or cracked them,</v>

4988
02:15:08.250 --> 02:15:09.690
<v Speaker 1>dropped it and he dropped him.</v>

4989
02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:14.160
<v Speaker 1>And then fader was inside control trying to finish him from side control.</v>

4990
02:15:14.250 --> 02:15:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson hit that under hook and he hit that under Jack under hook face,</v>

4991
02:15:19.111 --> 02:15:20.100
<v Speaker 1>planetary door.</v>

4992
02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Here's base plan of,</v>

4993
02:15:21.031 --> 02:15:21.600
<v Speaker 1>here it is.</v>

4994
02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Let's just watch it too.</v>

4995
02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:23.993
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

4996
02:15:24.250 --> 02:15:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

4997
02:15:24.630 --> 02:15:24.931
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

4998
02:15:24.931 --> 02:15:26.350
<v Speaker 1>The business decision first.</v>

4999
02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5000
02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:27.433
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

5001
02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:28.001
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

5002
02:15:28.001 --> 02:15:28.261
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna,</v>

5003
02:15:28.261 --> 02:15:29.640
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna take a few seconds for the show.</v>

5004
02:15:29.641 --> 02:15:30.474
<v Speaker 1>That decision.</v>

5005
02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:32.191
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

5006
02:15:32.191 --> 02:15:33.024
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5007
02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:35.040
<v Speaker 1>push ahead to the stoppage tracks.</v>

5008
02:15:35.310 --> 02:15:36.660
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he cracks,</v>

5009
02:15:36.661 --> 02:15:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Henderson has him on the ground before that.</v>

5010
02:15:38.461 --> 02:15:39.294
<v Speaker 1>Buddy,</v>

5011
02:15:39.540 --> 02:15:39.991
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

5012
02:15:39.991 --> 02:15:40.830
<v Speaker 1>he drops him.</v>

5013
02:15:41.070 --> 02:15:42.420
<v Speaker 1>He ends up in side control.</v>

5014
02:15:42.570 --> 02:15:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson from side control hat grabs the under hook.</v>

5015
02:15:45.090 --> 02:15:49.530
<v Speaker 1>It takes it to dogfight fight or doesn't throw whizzer and he exposes his back</v>

5016
02:15:49.531 --> 02:15:50.550
<v Speaker 1>and then he hits him with a shot.</v>

5017
02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:51.600
<v Speaker 1>You're very confident in their,</v>

5018
02:15:51.601 --> 02:15:53.940
<v Speaker 1>so I'm inclined to think that you know what you're talking about.</v>

5019
02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:55.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm never when I could be wrong.</v>

5020
02:15:55.681 --> 02:15:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Now I have a lower buddy and I'm like,</v>

5021
02:15:57.901 --> 02:15:58.231
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

5022
02:15:58.231 --> 02:15:59.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't remembered it all wrong.</v>

5023
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.020
<v Speaker 1>I could easily be wrong.</v>

5024
02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:03.460
<v Speaker 1>That's also fade or fade or there.</v>

5025
02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:04.110
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

5026
02:16:04.110 --> 02:16:05.190
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of,</v>

5027
02:16:05.250 --> 02:16:08.670
<v Speaker 1>that's Fado that had been stopped by big Silva still though.</v>

5028
02:16:08.900 --> 02:16:10.740
<v Speaker 1>It was also the big,</v>

5029
02:16:10.770 --> 02:16:13.820
<v Speaker 1>big Brett Rogers and didn't do well in that fight.</v>

5030
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Worries that real quick.</v>

5031
02:16:15.451 --> 02:16:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Here does.</v>

5032
02:16:15.810 --> 02:16:16.461
<v Speaker 1>He drops him.</v>

5033
02:16:16.461 --> 02:16:17.101
<v Speaker 1>This is the fight,</v>

5034
02:16:17.101 --> 02:16:17.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5035
02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:18.990
<v Speaker 1>He hits him with a hard punch.</v>

5036
02:16:19.050 --> 02:16:19.261
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

5037
02:16:19.261 --> 02:16:20.094
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal.</v>

5038
02:16:20.830 --> 02:16:21.663
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

02:16:24.710 --> 02:16:25.543
<v Speaker 1>control</v>

5041
02:16:29.090 --> 02:16:29.923
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>

5042
02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:33.060
<v Speaker 8>We go to the coach's book cards.</v>

5043
02:16:33.140 --> 02:16:35.200
<v Speaker 8>Burgess judges score in the car.</v>

5044
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:36.220
<v Speaker 8>Oh Shit.</v>

5050
02:16:55.350 --> 02:16:56.310
<v Speaker 8>licking their chops.</v>

5051
02:17:03.210 --> 02:17:03.920
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

5052
02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:06.120
<v Speaker 8>That was a fricking fight.</v>

5053
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:10.590
<v Speaker 8>You know what happened for this powerful has been at the end of the fight,</v>

5054
02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:12.090
<v Speaker 8>however you scored,</v>

5055

5057
02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:16.140
<v Speaker 8>They just said something to each other.</v>

5058
02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:18.593
<v Speaker 8>Shit.</v>

5060
02:17:21.730 --> 02:17:22.980
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear what they're saying to each other.</v>

5061
02:17:23.310 --> 02:17:24.720
<v Speaker 8>It's been quite good.</v>

5062
02:17:24.810 --> 02:17:26.240
<v Speaker 8>People talk about your skill.</v>

5063
02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Let's watch the feed or knock out one more time.</v>

5064
02:17:31.900 --> 02:17:33.710
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what business should I say it one more time.</v>

5065
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what he says.</v>

5066
02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:35.533
<v Speaker 1>Slow motion.</v>

5067
02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Give it up for Dan Henderson.</v>

5068
02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

5069
02:17:39.820 --> 02:17:40.051
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

5070
02:17:40.051 --> 02:17:40.884
<v Speaker 1>That goldfish.</v>

5071
02:17:40.910 --> 02:17:42.080
<v Speaker 1>We can't really play this though.</v>

5072
02:17:42.081 --> 02:17:42.950
<v Speaker 1>The problem is we can't.</v>

5073
02:17:43.050 --> 02:17:44.270
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

5074
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:46.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not ours,</v>

5075
02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:47.593
<v Speaker 1>so look,</v>

5076
02:17:47.670 --> 02:17:48.380
<v Speaker 1>you got to look.</v>

5077
02:17:48.380 --> 02:17:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Look right.</v>

5078
02:17:48.850 --> 02:17:49.683
<v Speaker 1>Hurts him.</v>

5079
02:17:49.700 --> 02:17:50.540
<v Speaker 1>He's boom.</v>

5080
02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Crowd control.</v>

5081
02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:53.630
<v Speaker 1>He grabs the under hood.</v>

5082
02:17:53.631 --> 02:17:53.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5083
02:17:53.841 --> 02:17:54.460
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

5084
02:17:54.460 --> 02:17:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5085
02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:56.330
<v Speaker 1>It looked like it was a deep house.</v>

5086
02:17:57.320 --> 02:17:59.810
<v Speaker 1>His right leg was on the outside.</v>

5087
02:18:01.090 --> 02:18:01.960
<v Speaker 1>It may have been quarter.</v>

5088
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.811
<v Speaker 1>You may have had the foot.</v>

5089
02:18:02.811 --> 02:18:04.460
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell one more time.</v>

5090
02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:06.153
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the deep.</v>

5091
02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5092
02:18:06.830 --> 02:18:07.011
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5093
02:18:07.011 --> 02:18:07.730
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

5094
02:18:07.730 --> 02:18:11.330
<v Speaker 1>I thought for some reason I had imagined that his right leg was in play.</v>

5095
02:18:11.331 --> 02:18:12.560
<v Speaker 1>That it was in between the legs.</v>

5096
02:18:12.561 --> 02:18:13.394
<v Speaker 1>But you're right.</v>

5097
02:18:13.700 --> 02:18:14.421
<v Speaker 1>You're totally right.</v>

5098
02:18:14.421 --> 02:18:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You second control.</v>

5101
02:18:16.711 --> 02:18:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe border guard,</v>

5102
02:18:17.890 --> 02:18:18.723
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5103

5104
02:18:19.340 --> 02:18:19.490
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5105
02:18:19.490 --> 02:18:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Wizard uppercuts.</v>

5106
02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

5107
02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:21.831
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

02:18:21.831 --> 02:18:22.664

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:23.450
<v Speaker 1>He did it.</v>

5110
02:18:23.450 --> 02:18:24.400
<v Speaker 1>He did it from the,</v>

5111
02:18:24.410 --> 02:18:25.910
<v Speaker 1>is that Michael Bisping's dad there?</v>

5112
02:18:26.340 --> 02:18:27.173
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>

5113

02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:37.431
<v Speaker 1>I know it's controversial.</v>

5122
02:18:37.431 --> 02:18:40.400
<v Speaker 1>I wish Bisbing you want them to retire?</v>

5123
02:18:40.401 --> 02:18:40.821
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

5124
02:18:40.821 --> 02:18:41.870
<v Speaker 1>He's not too old.</v>

02:19:01.670 --> 02:19:02.440
<v Speaker 1>rocky guy.</v>

5139
02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:04.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy enjoys victory</v>

5140
02:19:06.270 --> 02:19:07.970
<v Speaker 1>match that he's in.</v>

5141
02:19:08.660 --> 02:19:08.961
<v Speaker 1>He could,</v>

5142
02:19:08.961 --> 02:19:10.110
<v Speaker 1>when he got a point,</v>

5143
02:19:10.111 --> 02:19:11.570
<v Speaker 1>he could win every match point.</v>

5144
02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:12.600
<v Speaker 1>You never know,</v>

5145
02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:12.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5146
02:19:12.820 --> 02:19:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Hey Rockhold you never know.</v>

5147
02:19:14.660 --> 02:19:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying he's doing the blocking every single one of those matchups</v>

5148
02:19:17.550 --> 02:19:19.370
<v Speaker 1>that's why he's the underdog in the Rockhold fight.</v>

5149
02:19:19.371 --> 02:19:20.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's how he won the title.</v>

5150
02:19:20.211 --> 02:19:20.991
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the exception.</v>

5151
02:19:20.991 --> 02:19:21.410
<v Speaker 1>But you're right.</v>

5152
02:19:21.410 --> 02:19:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he say,</v>

5153
02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:22.210
<v Speaker 1>what did he,</v>

5154
02:19:22.210 --> 02:19:23.360
<v Speaker 1>was he favored in this fight?</v>

5155
02:19:23.540 --> 02:19:23.841
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5156
02:19:23.841 --> 02:19:24.674
<v Speaker 1>Two to one.</v>

5157
02:19:24.910 --> 02:19:25.321
<v Speaker 1>Two to one.</v>

5158
02:19:25.321 --> 02:19:25.940
<v Speaker 1>It's big.</v>

5159
02:19:25.940 --> 02:19:26.211
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5160
02:19:26.211 --> 02:19:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Here's the scary fight.</v>

5166
02:19:38.721 --> 02:19:39.860
<v Speaker 6>but he's a God damn monster.</v>

5167
02:19:39.890 --> 02:19:41.640
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they're all monsters right now though.</v>

5168
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:43.250

02:20:07.130 --> 02:20:08.240
<v Speaker 6>No need to do that.</v>

5189
02:20:08.290 --> 02:20:08.720
<v Speaker 6>It's true.</v>

5190
02:20:08.720 --> 02:20:08.960
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

5191
02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:10.160
<v Speaker 6>But he stuck it up.</v>

5192
02:20:10.280 --> 02:20:11.780
<v Speaker 6>Damien Maia stuck it out.</v>

5193
02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:13.640
<v Speaker 6>Rowan Carnero stuck it out.</v>

5194
02:20:13.700 --> 02:20:14.431
<v Speaker 6>If I breached the word,</v>

5195
02:20:14.431 --> 02:20:14.630

<v Speaker 6>Stryker's now with legit wrestling.</v>

5198
02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:21.960
<v Speaker 6>I heard for resolvers came to sember Senate.</v>

5199
02:20:22.220 --> 02:20:23.053
<v Speaker 6>That's what I heard.</v>

5200
02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:24.190
<v Speaker 6>That's the rumor mill.</v>

5201
02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:26.810
<v Speaker 6>Fallis late has got an arm triangle from hell.</v>

5202
02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:27.950
<v Speaker 6>He could put anybody.</v>

5203
02:20:28.460 --> 02:20:29.271
<v Speaker 6>Let me ask you this.</v>

5204
02:20:29.271 --> 02:20:30.380
<v Speaker 6>That's a sleeper right there.</v>

5205
02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:31.970
<v Speaker 6>Why would they have that fight?</v>

5206
02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:33.200
<v Speaker 6>Steeping needs time off.</v>

5207
02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:34.400
<v Speaker 6>How much time was he needed off?</v>

5208
02:20:34.900 --> 02:20:36.590
<v Speaker 6>Enough time for those guys to fight in the winter.</v>

5209
02:20:36.591 --> 02:20:37.424
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting.</v>

5210
02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:38.300
<v Speaker 6>That's interesting.</v>

5211
02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:39.080
<v Speaker 6>Do you agree with that?</v>

5212
02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:40.160
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that's good idea.</v>

5213
02:20:40.190 --> 02:20:40.750
<v Speaker 6>I do.</v>

5214
02:20:40.750 --> 02:20:44.690
<v Speaker 6>To have a cane or a ratio you can do because if you have Cain and for Bho,</v>

5215
02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:46.640
<v Speaker 6>both weight and fight different guys,</v>

5216
02:20:46.641 --> 02:20:47.300
<v Speaker 6>you know what I'm saying?</v>

5217
02:20:47.300 --> 02:20:47.901
<v Speaker 6>You could have that.</v>

5218
02:20:47.901 --> 02:20:49.250
<v Speaker 6>That could be a headliner to fuck.</v>

5219
02:20:49.251 --> 02:20:52.730
<v Speaker 6>You have to headline two Oh seven yeah.</v>

5220
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:56.810
<v Speaker 6>What side of Jamie [inaudible] December 30th to sell new years eve,</v>

5221
02:20:56.811 --> 02:20:58.940
<v Speaker 6>so they'd probably be the Ronda Rousey fight.</v>

5222
02:20:58.941 --> 02:20:59.840
<v Speaker 6>If she comes back,</v>

5223
02:20:59.870 --> 02:21:01.940
<v Speaker 6>she'll probably be on the New Year's Eve card.</v>

5224
02:21:01.970 --> 02:21:03.420
<v Speaker 6>That's usually their biggest cost.</v>

5225
02:21:03.421 --> 02:21:04.254
<v Speaker 6>That's going to happen.</v>

5226
02:21:04.820 --> 02:21:05.653
<v Speaker 6>Who knows?</v>

5227
02:21:06.480 --> 02:21:07.313
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

5229
02:21:07.990 --> 02:21:08.810
<v Speaker 6>you don't know.</v>

5230
02:21:08.810 --> 02:21:09.500
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5231
02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:10.333

02:21:11.560 --> 02:21:12.470
<v Speaker 6>have no idea about this.</v>

5233
02:21:12.471 --> 02:21:12.920
<v Speaker 6>You don't,</v>

5234
02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:13.880
<v Speaker 6>you don't really know.</v>

5235

<v Speaker 6>I think he is.</v>

5239
02:21:26.220 --> 02:21:28.380
<v Speaker 6>I wish we judge the fight on how you look at</v>

5240
02:21:29.970 --> 02:21:30.870
<v Speaker 6>legend son.</v>

5241
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:33.550
<v Speaker 6>That's cool.</v>

5242
02:21:34.150 --> 02:21:35.110
<v Speaker 6>Good for Bisbing man.</v>

5243
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:38.371
<v Speaker 6>What did he say?</v>

5244
02:21:38.371 --> 02:21:39.204
<v Speaker 6>I don't know</v>

5245
02:21:41.130 --> 02:21:41.400
<v Speaker 6>which.</v>

5246
02:21:41.400 --> 02:21:43.410
<v Speaker 6>We tried to fight on how you look after the fight.</v>

5247
02:21:43.420 --> 02:21:44.700
<v Speaker 6>How busted up.</v>

5248
02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:45.870
<v Speaker 6>How rude.</v>

5249
02:21:46.930 --> 02:21:47.970
<v Speaker 6>That's great.</v>

5250
02:21:47.980 --> 02:21:48.390
<v Speaker 6>Fine.</v>

5251
02:21:48.390 --> 02:21:49.920
<v Speaker 6>That's a funny thing to say.</v>

5252
02:21:50.420 --> 02:21:51.750
<v Speaker 6>Back at Bisping's career,</v>

5253
02:21:51.751 --> 02:21:55.050
<v Speaker 6>when they do a documentary on that show on Hbo,</v>

5254
02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:57.180
<v Speaker 6>it ended right now.</v>

5255
02:21:57.210 --> 02:21:58.043
<v Speaker 6>Fuck,</v>

5256
02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:58.940

5258
02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:00.870
<v Speaker 6>Well yeah,</v>

5259
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:03.090
<v Speaker 6>he's by far the biggest thing ever happened in UK MMA.</v>

5260
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:04.200
<v Speaker 6>But you look at his career,</v>

5261
02:22:04.201 --> 02:22:04.651
<v Speaker 6>looking at the guys,</v>

5262
02:22:04.651 --> 02:22:07.530
<v Speaker 6>he's lost to most of our TRT guys and looking at the ics beat.</v>

5263
02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:07.861
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

5264
02:22:07.861 --> 02:22:09.150
<v Speaker 6>but the UK is Ireland,</v>

5265
02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:09.871
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5266
02:22:09.871 --> 02:22:11.310
<v Speaker 6>Didn't we establish that?</v>

5267
02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:13.110
<v Speaker 6>It's not someone tweeted and said,</v>

5268
02:22:13.111 --> 02:22:13.440
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

5269
02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:13.800
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

02:22:16.890 --> 02:22:17.030

<v Speaker 6>we didn't.</v>

5275
02:22:17.351 --> 02:22:20.370
<v Speaker 6>We don't really get offended by geography.</v>

5276
02:22:20.460 --> 02:22:21.360
<v Speaker 6>We don't know.</v>

5277
02:22:21.420 --> 02:22:22.860
<v Speaker 6>We don't know who your king is.</v>

5278
02:22:23.220 --> 02:22:23.941
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of shit.</v>

5279
02:22:23.941 --> 02:22:24.601
<v Speaker 6>We don't know.</v>

5280
02:22:24.601 --> 02:22:25.620
<v Speaker 6>Kings are cool.</v>

5281
02:22:25.621 --> 02:22:27.060
<v Speaker 6>I wish we had a king better than it.</v>

5282
02:22:27.060 --> 02:22:27.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5283
02:22:27.150 --> 02:22:28.260
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck we got now?</v>

5284
02:22:28.261 --> 02:22:30.330
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they have tried this in the God damn.</v>

5285
02:22:30.380 --> 02:22:31.080
<v Speaker 6>Eddie's upset.</v>

5286
02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:31.913
<v Speaker 6>I don't think Ireland,</v>

5287
02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:35.070
<v Speaker 6>Ireland doesn't have kings.</v>

5288
02:22:35.730 --> 02:22:36.563
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>

5289
02:22:36.670 --> 02:22:36.940
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

5290
02:22:36.940 --> 02:22:37.500
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5291
02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:42.500
<v Speaker 6>I wish I knew you all sound like complete princes and collab queens.</v>

5292

5297
02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:55.680

5298
02:22:55.681 --> 02:22:58.950
<v Speaker 6>but I thought Ireland in Northern Ireland would like pretty much United now.</v>

5306
02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:08.993

<v Speaker 2>I don't want that.</v>

5458
02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:21.340
<v Speaker 2>They haven't figured out how to take your brain and put it on another body</v>

5459
02:27:21.341 --> 02:27:22.150
<v Speaker 2>because it was common.</v>

5460
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:23.320
<v Speaker 2>They're doing some experiments.</v>

5461
02:27:23.321 --> 02:27:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Would you do it 80 class when I was a hundred I was got to do while you are</v>

5462
02:27:28.211 --> 02:27:28.810
<v Speaker 2>alive.</v>

5463
02:27:28.810 --> 02:27:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Piece of basically you got to commit suicide and then they have you and your</v>

5464
02:27:31.511 --> 02:27:32.344
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

5465
02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:34.260
<v Speaker 2>You're in the hospital and then they got pretty hard.</v>

5466
02:27:34.690 --> 02:27:37.000
<v Speaker 2>They have to be like brain from teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.</v>

5467
02:27:37.020 --> 02:27:37.811
<v Speaker 2>You have to be that guy.</v>

5468
02:27:37.811 --> 02:27:42.220
<v Speaker 2>I think just something they have like a map of the future laid out and you have</v>

5469
02:27:42.221 --> 02:27:43.720
<v Speaker 2>to commit to this map of the future.</v>

5470
02:27:43.721 --> 02:27:44.920
<v Speaker 2>They've got to go look right now.</v>

5471
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:46.270
<v Speaker 2>We can't put you in another body,</v>

5472
02:27:46.390 --> 02:27:51.390
<v Speaker 2>but what we can to keep your body in this jail for at least three years before</v>

5473
02:27:51.491 --> 02:27:53.550
<v Speaker 2>we put you in another body and you can still talk to your home.</v>

5474
02:27:53.551 --> 02:27:54.680
<v Speaker 2>You say we have it,</v>

5475
02:27:57.190 --> 02:27:58.360
<v Speaker 2>the brain and the body.</v>

5476
02:27:58.770 --> 02:27:59.930
<v Speaker 2>He's got like a super robot</v>

5477
02:28:01.730 --> 02:28:03.280
<v Speaker 2>that was shredders main homie.</v>

5478
02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:06.270
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm talking about,</v>

5479
02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:08.740
<v Speaker 2>but imagine if they said Look Gi,</v>

5480
02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:12.070
<v Speaker 2>what we've determined is that the brain has to sustain this solution for three</v>

5481
02:28:12.071 --> 02:28:12.341
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

5482
02:28:12.341 --> 02:28:13.510
<v Speaker 2>So for three years you are,</v>

5483
02:28:13.530 --> 02:28:15.370
<v Speaker 2>you are going to be trapped in this brain,</v>

5484
02:28:15.400 --> 02:28:16.510
<v Speaker 2>but you'll stay alive.</v>

5485
02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:21.010
<v Speaker 2>You'll know that you're alive and you're fucked and you don't know what it's</v>

5486
02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:21.853
<v Speaker 2>going to be.</v>

5487
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:24.500
<v Speaker 2>We can come out after three years.</v>

5488
02:28:24.501 --> 02:28:27.380
<v Speaker 2>We don't know how you're going to deal with the fact that you couldn't talk.</v>

5489
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:29.120
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't tell anybody you were okay.</v>

5490
02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:34.300
<v Speaker 2>He had to survive inside of this jar for three years as a drain and electro with</v>

5491
02:28:35.001 --> 02:28:37.190
<v Speaker 2>an eye so that you could see out your brain,</v>

5492
02:28:37.460 --> 02:28:38.720
<v Speaker 2>so you can't talk,</v>

5493
02:28:38.721 --> 02:28:39.650
<v Speaker 2>you can't communicate,</v>

5494
02:28:39.740 --> 02:28:42.350
<v Speaker 2>but the people that know your homeys,</v>

5495
02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:43.580
<v Speaker 2>when your family comes in,</v>

5496
02:28:43.581 --> 02:28:45.140
<v Speaker 2>they can just put on a fucking TV.</v>

5497
02:28:45.141 --> 02:28:45.411
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

5498
02:28:45.411 --> 02:28:46.340
<v Speaker 2>he loves this shit.</v>

5499
02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

5500
02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:49.370
<v Speaker 2>And they could see that that the electric eye blinking,</v>

5501
02:28:49.460 --> 02:28:54.460
<v Speaker 2>bluish kind of paralyzed for three years term.</v>

5502
02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:56.150
<v Speaker 2>You're doing a jail term for three years.</v>

5503
02:28:57.290 --> 02:28:59.570
<v Speaker 2>If I was a hundred my balls right down to the ground,</v>

5504
02:28:59.571 --> 02:29:00.404
<v Speaker 2>my bad day,</v>

5505
02:29:00.610 --> 02:29:01.370
<v Speaker 2>go do it.</v>

5506
02:29:01.370 --> 02:29:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Girls at fall in love with brains and chicken.</v>

5507
02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:06.980
<v Speaker 2>He says he can't communicate about his Mars.</v>

5508
02:29:06.990 --> 02:29:07.900
<v Speaker 2>No communicating,</v>

5509
02:29:08.010 --> 02:29:08.810
<v Speaker 2>can't communicate,</v>

5510
02:29:08.810 --> 02:29:12.440
<v Speaker 2>but he can eventually the smart motherfuckers can communicate little by little</v>

5511
02:29:15.530 --> 02:29:16.640
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked up.</v>

5512
02:29:16.641 --> 02:29:20.150
<v Speaker 2>The movie evolution is evolution and there's going to be a couple of brains that</v>

5513
02:29:20.151 --> 02:29:22.100
<v Speaker 2>can do clicks for yes or no.</v>

5514
02:29:24.430 --> 02:29:25.020
<v Speaker 2>My thought,</v>

5515
02:29:25.020 --> 02:29:27.950
<v Speaker 2>my thought is doing three years in a bowl of Jello.</v>

5516
02:29:27.951 --> 02:29:28.641
<v Speaker 2>When you come out,</v>

5517
02:29:28.641 --> 02:29:33.000
<v Speaker 2>we have to hope that you can psychologically survive the fact that three hour</v>

5518
02:29:34.460 --> 02:29:35.150
<v Speaker 2>talk.</v>

5519
02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:36.910
<v Speaker 2>Do you have in your eyes?</v>

5523

5524
02:29:50.880 --> 02:29:55.290
<v Speaker 2>They gonna come in and they're fucker intense and you're watching and you can</v>

5525
02:29:55.291 --> 02:29:56.061
<v Speaker 2>tell by the brain,</v>

5526
02:29:56.061 --> 02:29:59.560
<v Speaker 2>aura and the color eastern bloc,</v>

5527
02:30:02.690 --> 02:30:03.111
<v Speaker 2>the brain,</v>

5528
02:30:03.111 --> 02:30:03.944
<v Speaker 2>just</v>

5529
02:30:05.150 --> 02:30:07.660
<v Speaker 2>eastern bloc due to big giant square heads.</v>

5530
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Super aggressive with face tattoos.</v>

5531
02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:12.830
<v Speaker 9>Wow.</v>

5532
02:30:12.830 --> 02:30:13.280
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>

5533
02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:14.600
<v Speaker 2>it's the frequency of the brain.</v>

5534
02:30:15.580 --> 02:30:17.840
<v Speaker 2>The Gremlin after midnight</v>

5535
02:30:20.750 --> 02:30:21.740
<v Speaker 2>ruining my movie,</v>

5536
02:30:22.250 --> 02:30:22.881
<v Speaker 2>my movie,</v>

5537
02:30:22.881 --> 02:30:23.920
<v Speaker 2>the brain is just,</v>

5538
02:30:23.930 --> 02:30:24.950
<v Speaker 2>the torture is,</v>

5539
02:30:24.951 --> 02:30:26.780
<v Speaker 2>there's just no way you can express yourself.</v>

5540
02:30:26.810 --> 02:30:28.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm not terrible.</v>

5541
02:30:31.390 --> 02:30:32.360
<v Speaker 2>They can't read your brain.</v>

5542
02:30:32.361 --> 02:30:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Your brain is in suspended animation.</v>

5543
02:30:34.101 --> 02:30:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Pulse,</v>

5544
02:30:34.720 --> 02:30:35.440
<v Speaker 2>three years,</v>

5545
02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:38.930
<v Speaker 2>blood rushing to it to hope for three years.</v>

5546
02:30:38.931 --> 02:30:41.820
<v Speaker 2>It's in some sort of a biogen editor,</v>

5547
02:30:42.170 --> 02:30:43.310
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

5548

02:30:48.090 --> 02:30:49.820
<v Speaker 2>Can I sign up for</v>

5551
02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:51.830
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

5552
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Bring strippers and it's like,</v>

5553
02:30:53.670 --> 02:30:54.880
<v Speaker 2>there's no coincidence.</v>

5554
02:30:55.400 --> 02:30:57.030
<v Speaker 2>It's conspiracy.</v>

5555
02:30:58.410 --> 02:30:59.370
<v Speaker 2>And the skeptics like,</v>

5556
02:30:59.440 --> 02:30:59.981
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>

5557
02:30:59.981 --> 02:31:00.880
<v Speaker 2>It's just the brain.</v>

5558
02:31:03.060 --> 02:31:03.893
<v Speaker 2>Drunks.</v>

5559
02:31:04.660 --> 02:31:05.320
<v Speaker 2>Too many,</v>

5560
02:31:05.320 --> 02:31:07.450
<v Speaker 2>too many drinks after midnight.</v>

5561
02:31:08.170 --> 02:31:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Feed him after midnight.</v>

5562
02:31:09.431 --> 02:31:11.520
<v Speaker 2>So definitely making sense for sure.</v>

5563
02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:11.751
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5564
02:31:11.751 --> 02:31:12.584
<v Speaker 2>it's so fresh.</v>

5565
02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5566
02:31:12.970 --> 02:31:15.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's for anyone has made sense ever.</v>

5567
02:31:17.260 --> 02:31:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

5568
02:31:17.660 --> 02:31:18.493
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

5569
02:31:18.640 --> 02:31:19.920
<v Speaker 2>why are you with Joe?</v>

5570
02:31:19.921 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 2>Do</v>

5571
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:20.903
<v Speaker 1>you hate me?</v>

5572
02:31:20.910 --> 02:31:21.100
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

5573
02:31:21.100 --> 02:31:21.933
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

5574
02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:28.620
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

5575
02:31:28.620 --> 02:31:29.880
<v Speaker 1>it's totally logical.</v>

5576
02:31:30.130 --> 02:31:30.963
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5577
02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:34.560
<v Speaker 1>here's the fucked up thing.</v>

5578
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:36.380
<v Speaker 1>If you do die right,</v>

5579
02:31:36.450 --> 02:31:41.450
<v Speaker 1>and they can take your brain and transfer port it into another body and rig up</v>

5580
02:31:41.821 --> 02:31:42.660
<v Speaker 1>something for you.</v>

5581
02:31:43.080 --> 02:31:47.190
<v Speaker 1>What if we find out though that death is not really death,</v>

5582
02:31:47.520 --> 02:31:52.410
<v Speaker 1>that all these ancient religions were on to something is that death is a portal</v>

5583
02:31:52.470 --> 02:31:57.060
<v Speaker 1>to another experience that you haven't entered into yet and I was awesome.</v>

5584
02:31:57.150 --> 02:31:57.983
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done that,</v>

5585
02:31:58.590 --> 02:32:00.030
<v Speaker 1>but I've done DMT obviously,</v>

5586
02:32:00.750 --> 02:32:02.730
<v Speaker 1>which is the main thing in Iowasca,</v>

5587
02:32:02.731 --> 02:32:06.520
<v Speaker 1>which is what your body produces when you're done with someone else.</v>

5588
02:32:06.810 --> 02:32:07.643
<v Speaker 1>Someone else.</v>

5589
02:32:08.610 --> 02:32:11.250
<v Speaker 1>You did five methodoxy DMT.</v>

5590
02:32:11.420 --> 02:32:12.031
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

5591
02:32:12.031 --> 02:32:17.031
<v Speaker 1>and it was a very spiritual experience and made me believes that there I believe</v>

5592
02:32:17.371 --> 02:32:18.091
<v Speaker 1>in a higher power.</v>

5593
02:32:18.091 --> 02:32:18.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

5594
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's that bearded dude.</v>

5595
02:32:20.700 --> 02:32:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's the olive dude.</v>

5596
02:32:22.290 --> 02:32:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno if it's the Jewish dude.</v>

5597
02:32:24.120 --> 02:32:26.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's the African dude or the Inca dude.</v>

5598
02:32:26.610 --> 02:32:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go there.</v>

5599
02:32:27.010 --> 02:32:28.440
<v Speaker 1>There's some kind of shit.</v>

5600
02:32:28.830 --> 02:32:31.260
<v Speaker 1>There's some something in my opinion,</v>

5601
02:32:31.261 --> 02:32:32.094
<v Speaker 1>this is just my opinion.</v>

5602
02:32:32.370 --> 02:32:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Something created that created,</v>

5603
02:32:34.260 --> 02:32:35.790
<v Speaker 1>there is a creator of some sort.</v>

5604
02:32:35.850 --> 02:32:38.220
<v Speaker 1>It could be a fucking nerd computer simulation.</v>

5605
02:32:38.370 --> 02:32:40.830
<v Speaker 1>People believed that everyone believes in computer simulations.</v>

5606
02:32:41.040 --> 02:32:41.191
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5607
02:32:41.191 --> 02:32:42.024
<v Speaker 1>that could be true.</v>

5608
02:32:42.150 --> 02:32:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Kneeled to grass.</v>

5609
02:32:43.191 --> 02:32:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Tyson says it.</v>

5610
02:32:44.670 --> 02:32:47.880
<v Speaker 1>So that could be true that we're a computer in a computer simulation.</v>

5611
02:32:48.120 --> 02:32:51.390
<v Speaker 1>But when you start talking about like a creator or a higher power,</v>

5612
02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:51.901
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

5613
02:32:51.901 --> 02:32:52.734
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

5614
02:32:54.310 --> 02:32:56.880
<v Speaker 1>but a computer centers are not following that</v>

5615
02:32:59.060 --> 02:32:59.893
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

5616
02:33:02.580 --> 02:33:05.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that fucking Neil degrasse Tyson,</v>

5617
02:33:05.521 --> 02:33:09.330
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't like him because he represents absolute facts that can't be argued</v>

5618
02:33:09.331 --> 02:33:09.541
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

5619
02:33:09.541 --> 02:33:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And that Shit's dangerous for a conspiracy theorist.</v>

5620
02:33:11.790 --> 02:33:13.020
<v Speaker 1>If Neil walked in right now,</v>

5621
02:33:13.021 --> 02:33:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I would love it.</v>

5622
02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

5623
02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:20.730
<v Speaker 1>How you know what I would do if Neil degrasse Tyson walked in right now?</v>

5624
02:33:21.300 --> 02:33:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5625
02:33:21.870 --> 02:33:23.890
<v Speaker 1>what would you do to make a mind fuck you?</v>

5626
02:33:25.140 --> 02:33:26.250
<v Speaker 1>He would choke your mind.</v>

5627
02:33:26.270 --> 02:33:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Eti you choke your mind,</v>

5628
02:33:28.310 --> 02:33:29.570
<v Speaker 1>your mind and electric.</v>

5629
02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:30.630
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about the moon.</v>

5630
02:33:31.140 --> 02:33:32.840
<v Speaker 1>And then I would listen to him talk about the,</v>

5631
02:33:32.841 --> 02:33:34.500
<v Speaker 1>how we actually went to the moon.</v>

5632
02:33:34.590 --> 02:33:35.423
<v Speaker 1>And I would,</v>

5633
02:33:35.470 --> 02:33:36.303
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5634
02:33:36.350 --> 02:33:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy that.</v>

5635
02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

5636
02:33:38.250 --> 02:33:39.150
<v Speaker 1>so what was your point?</v>

5637
02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember now.</v>

5638
02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:41.693
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

5639
02:33:43.470 --> 02:33:44.700
<v Speaker 1>it was about if you die,</v>

5640
02:33:44.780 --> 02:33:46.600
<v Speaker 1>what chapter yet?</v>

5641
02:33:47.010 --> 02:33:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Another portal is that we don't know.</v>

5642
02:33:49.380 --> 02:33:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

5643
02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:51.000
<v Speaker 1>I've said this before,</v>

5644
02:33:51.001 --> 02:33:51.834
<v Speaker 1>but I'll say it again.</v>

5645
02:33:52.770 --> 02:33:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's scared to sleep,</v>

5646
02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:55.470
<v Speaker 1>but everybody's scared to die.</v>

5647
02:33:56.370 --> 02:33:56.611
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5648
02:33:56.611 --> 02:33:57.660
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to go to sleep.</v>

5649
02:33:57.720 --> 02:33:58.381
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does.</v>

5650
02:33:58.381 --> 02:34:00.780
<v Speaker 1>We look forward to it and we look forward to shutting off.</v>

5651
02:34:00.781 --> 02:34:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Cause we know that we're going to come back.</v>

5652
02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:06.120
<v Speaker 1>But everybody's terrified of death and we don't understand sleep.</v>

5653
02:34:06.121 --> 02:34:07.470
<v Speaker 1>We don't know why we need it.</v>

5654
02:34:07.471 --> 02:34:08.850
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the fuck happens.</v>

5655
02:34:08.851 --> 02:34:10.110
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what dreams are.</v>

5656
02:34:10.111 --> 02:34:13.800
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand what kind of psychedelic chemicals are being produced by our</v>

5657
02:34:13.801 --> 02:34:15.660
<v Speaker 1>own brains while we're out cold.</v>

5658
02:34:15.661 --> 02:34:16.920
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the experience is.</v>

5659
02:34:17.170 --> 02:34:20.680
<v Speaker 1>We know we come back with crazy memories and some people are capable of</v>

5660
02:34:20.681 --> 02:34:24.280
<v Speaker 1>manipulating those memories or manipulating that experience and they have lucid</v>

5661
02:34:24.281 --> 02:34:25.114
<v Speaker 1>dreaming.</v>

5662
02:34:25.330 --> 02:34:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I have to just,</v>

5663
02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5664
02:34:27.010 --> 02:34:30.760
<v Speaker 1>I've had brief moments of lucid dreaming and I've never put any effort</v>

5665
02:34:30.940 --> 02:34:33.130
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever into trying to get good at it.</v>

5666
02:34:33.310 --> 02:34:34.720
<v Speaker 1>But I know that some people do.</v>

5667
02:34:34.721 --> 02:34:36.250
<v Speaker 1>And they concentrate on it all the time.</v>

5668
02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:37.113
<v Speaker 1>I've done it.</v>

5669
02:34:37.660 --> 02:34:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

5670
02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:39.063
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you have.</v>

5671
02:34:39.130 --> 02:34:40.230
<v Speaker 1>My point is,</v>

5672
02:34:40.630 --> 02:34:40.871
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5673
02:34:40.871 --> 02:34:41.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot,</v>

5674
02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:43.570
<v Speaker 1>but my point is we don't know what it is.</v>

5675
02:34:44.140 --> 02:34:45.190
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what death is.</v>

5676
02:34:45.191 --> 02:34:45.820
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

5677
02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:50.380
<v Speaker 1>We were so convinced that this state of being awake is the only state that</v>

5678
02:34:50.381 --> 02:34:51.214
<v Speaker 1>exists,</v>

5679
02:34:51.310 --> 02:34:54.580
<v Speaker 1>but we already know of another state that we have no evidence when we,</v>

5680
02:34:54.581 --> 02:34:55.690
<v Speaker 1>when we are alive.</v>

5681
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:56.830
<v Speaker 1>When you're walking through life,</v>

5682
02:34:56.831 --> 02:34:57.790
<v Speaker 1>you watch the UFC,</v>

5683
02:34:57.791 --> 02:34:58.780
<v Speaker 1>you're driving your car.</v>

5684
02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:03.130
<v Speaker 1>You have no fucking idea what was going on for eight hours of your day.</v>

5685
02:35:03.310 --> 02:35:04.143
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

5686
02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:05.110
<v Speaker 1>You wake up,</v>

5687
02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:06.610
<v Speaker 1>oh my alarm clock went up.</v>

5688
02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Time to get up.</v>

5689
02:35:08.050 --> 02:35:08.620
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>

5690
02:35:08.620 --> 02:35:13.620
<v Speaker 1>you have evidence based on a few fucking slide shows of ridiculousness that took</v>

5691
02:35:16.571 --> 02:35:18.610
<v Speaker 1>place in your imagination.</v>

5692
02:35:18.611 --> 02:35:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Air quotes in the last eight fucking hours.</v>

5693
02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:23.800
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about five minutes of your day.</v>

5694
02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:26.590
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about eight fucking hours of your day.</v>

5695
02:35:26.590 --> 02:35:28.600
<v Speaker 1>We have to shut your head off.</v>

5696
02:35:28.810 --> 02:35:28.981
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

5697
02:35:28.981 --> 02:35:31.690
<v Speaker 1>You literally have no idea what's going on around you.</v>

5698
02:35:31.810 --> 02:35:33.880
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea.</v>

5699
02:35:33.881 --> 02:35:38.500
<v Speaker 1>You have faith that you're going to wake up cause you woken up every other day</v>

5700
02:35:38.590 --> 02:35:39.610
<v Speaker 1>for your whole life.</v>

5701
02:35:39.940 --> 02:35:44.420
<v Speaker 1>That alone is fucking bizarre that you would have any confidence whatsoever.</v>

5702
02:35:44.421 --> 02:35:48.970
<v Speaker 1>It's what happens when you die and that you could tell me that you know for sure</v>

5703
02:35:48.971 --> 02:35:51.520
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what the fuck happens when you go to sleep.</v>

5704
02:35:51.521 --> 02:35:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Bitch,</v>

5705
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:56.860
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a damn clue as to what the fuck happens when your eyes are closed</v>

5706
02:35:56.861 --> 02:35:57.780
<v Speaker 1>and you're [inaudible]</v>

5707
02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:00.160
<v Speaker 1>to die.</v>

5708
02:36:00.940 --> 02:36:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Something has to what's going on in your brain.</v>

5709
02:36:02.770 --> 02:36:03.491
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

5710
02:36:03.491 --> 02:36:04.390
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

5711
02:36:04.470 --> 02:36:05.230
<v Speaker 1>It's this.</v>

5712
02:36:05.230 --> 02:36:10.230
<v Speaker 1>We're all basing on our rudimentary understanding of normal awake consciousness,</v>

5713
02:36:11.141 --> 02:36:15.070
<v Speaker 1>which for a guy like me that's on a brain scientist or you or anybody in this</v>

5714
02:36:15.071 --> 02:36:15.580
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>

5715
02:36:15.580 --> 02:36:16.990
<v Speaker 1>we don't fucking know.</v>

5716
02:36:17.140 --> 02:36:21.250
<v Speaker 1>We barely understand consciousness on the highest levels of science.</v>

5717
02:36:21.251 --> 02:36:23.560
<v Speaker 1>They barely understand what consciousness is.</v>

5718
02:36:23.561 --> 02:36:24.010
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

5719
02:36:24.010 --> 02:36:28.390
<v Speaker 1>there's arguments as to what causes it this August arguments as to what defines</v>

5720
02:36:28.391 --> 02:36:28.790
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

5721
02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:30.820
<v Speaker 1>which is it does a plant consciousness.</v>

5722
02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Plants can detect it when animals are chewing next to them,</v>

5723
02:36:34.150 --> 02:36:35.040
<v Speaker 1>plants they,</v>

5724
02:36:35.170 --> 02:36:38.590
<v Speaker 1>they excrete certain chemicals to make themselves tastes like shit.</v>

5725
02:36:38.591 --> 02:36:41.680
<v Speaker 1>When they hear caterpillar sounds from a tape recorder.</v>

5726
02:36:41.800 --> 02:36:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Is that conscious?</v>

5727
02:36:42.850 --> 02:36:43.211
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5728
02:36:43.211 --> 02:36:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5729
02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:44.620
<v Speaker 1>What about a dog?</v>

5730
02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:46.540
<v Speaker 1>My dog knows when I'm pulling into the driveway,</v>

5731
02:36:46.541 --> 02:36:47.380
<v Speaker 1>he starts barking.</v>

5732
02:36:47.381 --> 02:36:48.490
<v Speaker 1>He gets excited to see me.</v>

5733
02:36:48.491 --> 02:36:49.390
<v Speaker 1>Is he conscious?</v>

5734
02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:49.930
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5735
02:36:49.930 --> 02:36:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Venus fly trap.</v>

5736
02:36:51.370 --> 02:36:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

5737
02:36:52.130 --> 02:36:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Or how about those ones in the Amazon and eat rats?</v>

5738

<v Speaker 1>They got this crazy.</v>

5739
02:36:55.130 --> 02:36:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Feels like a trumpet.</v>

5740
02:36:56.590 --> 02:36:57.750
<v Speaker 1>A rat falls into it.</v>

5741
02:36:57.760 --> 02:36:59.040
<v Speaker 1>It dissolves the rat.</v>

5742
02:36:59.240 --> 02:36:59.620
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

5743
02:36:59.620 --> 02:36:59.860

02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Remember on TV when I was a kid,</v>

5751
02:37:09.401 --> 02:37:10.690
<v Speaker 1>you could order that shit.</v>

5752
02:37:10.810 --> 02:37:11.321
<v Speaker 1>That was though.</v>

5753
02:37:11.321 --> 02:37:12.590
<v Speaker 1>He's still a little mercial.</v>

5756
02:37:17.710 --> 02:37:19.700
<v Speaker 2>It on Valentine's Day.</v>

5757
02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5758
02:37:20.370 --> 02:37:23.480
<v Speaker 2>two dozen Dina's flight tracker should I believe?</v>

5759
02:37:23.481 --> 02:37:26.030
<v Speaker 2>I think I had one ex wife.</v>

5760
02:37:26.031 --> 02:37:27.890
<v Speaker 2>That shit right there.</v>

5761
02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:29.023
<v Speaker 2>Dope Dude.</v>

5762
02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:30.740
<v Speaker 2>The eat flies in your house.</v>

5763
02:37:31.250 --> 02:37:32.061
<v Speaker 2>Leave the window open.</v>

5764
02:37:32.061 --> 02:37:32.451
<v Speaker 2>Come on in,</v>

5765
02:37:32.451 --> 02:37:33.250
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

5766
02:37:33.250 --> 02:37:35.330
<v Speaker 2>You don't pull it all fucking shit.</v>

5767
02:37:35.331 --> 02:37:37.740
<v Speaker 2>What is a big sign and fly trap number recorded?</v>

5768
02:37:37.741 --> 02:37:38.271
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine?</v>

5769
02:37:38.271 --> 02:37:40.400
<v Speaker 2>One like little shop of horrors.</v>

5770
02:37:40.401 --> 02:37:42.180
<v Speaker 2>Remember that she had AP move?</v>

5771
02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:43.040
<v Speaker 2>Was that based on,</v>

5772
02:37:43.300 --> 02:37:44.210
<v Speaker 2>what was he rapping?</v>

5773
02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:45.170
<v Speaker 2>The Cuny people,</v>

5774
02:37:45.171 --> 02:37:45.501
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

5775
02:37:45.501 --> 02:37:47.750
<v Speaker 2>it could be something like if you went back to the dinosaur days,</v>

5776
02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:51.740
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee there's all sorts of plants that were eating shit that slipped up.</v>

5777
02:37:51.741 --> 02:37:56.050
<v Speaker 2>We're sure eating like ancient Rome or wherever the fuck there was around 65</v>

5778
02:37:56.050 --> 02:37:56.391
<v Speaker 2>million years.</v>

5779
02:37:56.391 --> 02:37:58.540
<v Speaker 2>Lost Line of source.</v>

5780
02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's just the same guy that thinks that the earth is flat?</v>

5781
02:38:02.690 --> 02:38:05.690
<v Speaker 2>You put out a video about dinosaurs being fake problem with that.</v>

5782
02:38:05.690 --> 02:38:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Of course we have bones.</v>

5783
02:38:06.921 --> 02:38:08.320
<v Speaker 2>There's false shit load of them.</v>

5784
02:38:09.250 --> 02:38:09.550
<v Speaker 2>All of them,</v>

5785
02:38:09.550 --> 02:38:10.540
<v Speaker 2>like in the museums,</v>

5786
02:38:10.590 --> 02:38:14.200
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of them are bad and they fell out of them,</v>

5787
02:38:14.260 --> 02:38:15.093
<v Speaker 2>but that's not true.</v>

5788
02:38:15.170 --> 02:38:15.381
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

5789
02:38:15.381 --> 02:38:16.160
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>

5790
02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:18.080
<v Speaker 2>When you look in at a fossil,</v>

5791
02:38:18.110 --> 02:38:21.110
<v Speaker 2>well you're looking at is not necessarily really a bone.</v>

5792
02:38:21.290 --> 02:38:26.210
<v Speaker 2>What it is is we're minerals have taken place of where the bone used to be,</v>

5793
02:38:26.211 --> 02:38:27.380
<v Speaker 2>what a fossilized like.</v>

5794
02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever see a megalodon tooth,</v>

5795
02:38:29.330 --> 02:38:31.610
<v Speaker 2>like a shark tooth on discovery channel?</v>

5796
02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Mack Bud Brotzmann had one on his office.</v>

5797
02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:36.140
<v Speaker 2>Remember we had that conversation,</v>

5798
02:38:36.410 --> 02:38:37.460
<v Speaker 2>we had a conversation about it,</v>

5799
02:38:37.580 --> 02:38:39.770
<v Speaker 2>and bud was telling me that this is a mega don tooth,</v>

5800
02:38:39.950 --> 02:38:40.481
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

5801
02:38:40.481 --> 02:38:41.510
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of,</v>

5802
02:38:41.780 --> 02:38:43.550
<v Speaker 2>it is kind of a mega don tooth,</v>

5803
02:38:43.551 --> 02:38:45.710
<v Speaker 2>but it really is a fossil of mega don to,</v>

5804
02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:49.010
<v Speaker 2>what that means is over millions and millions and millions of years,</v>

5805
02:38:49.310 --> 02:38:54.310
<v Speaker 2>the actual tooth itself is changed by the ground and it's becomes mineralized</v>

5806
02:38:55.430 --> 02:38:56.990
<v Speaker 2>and it becomes like a rock.</v>

5807
02:38:57.230 --> 02:38:59.660
<v Speaker 2>So it's the shape of a megalodon tooth,</v>

5808
02:38:59.870 --> 02:39:03.290
<v Speaker 2>but it's not exactly the same as it was in the Mega Don's mouth.</v>

5809
02:39:03.570 --> 02:39:05.010
<v Speaker 2>So years ago.</v>

5810
02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:08.000
<v Speaker 2>The actual shape,</v>

5811
02:39:08.260 --> 02:39:09.093
<v Speaker 2>the shape of it,</v>

5812
02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:10.510
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a tooth.</v>

5813
02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:11.361
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember,</v>

5814
02:39:11.361 --> 02:39:12.710
<v Speaker 2>do a DNA test on it?</v>

5815
02:39:12.711 --> 02:39:13.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a fossil.</v>

5816
02:39:14.350 --> 02:39:15.183
<v Speaker 2>It's weed.</v>

5817
02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:19.910
<v Speaker 2>And you were a kid that oil came from dinosaurs.</v>

5818
02:39:19.940 --> 02:39:20.451
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that?</v>

5819
02:39:20.451 --> 02:39:20.810
<v Speaker 2>She had,</v>

5820
02:39:20.810 --> 02:39:22.780
<v Speaker 2>that's what they used to fossil fuels.</v>

5821
02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:24.771
<v Speaker 2>Hey Man,</v>

5822
02:39:24.771 --> 02:39:26.830
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy who worked on that.</v>

5823
02:39:26.831 --> 02:39:28.160
<v Speaker 2>JFK Administration.</v>

5824
02:39:28.161 --> 02:39:33.161
<v Speaker 2>He was the chief of special operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the</v>

5825
02:39:35.330 --> 02:39:36.590
<v Speaker 2>JFK administration.</v>

5826
02:39:36.770 --> 02:39:40.550
<v Speaker 2>His name is l Fletcher Prouty proudy l Fletcher.</v>

5827
02:39:40.551 --> 02:39:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Prouty.</v>

5828
02:39:41.150 --> 02:39:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Look that dude up and when you,</v>

5829
02:39:42.610 --> 02:39:43.940
<v Speaker 2>what he says about oil,</v>

5830
02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit with that dude says a bottle.</v>

5831
02:39:46.700 --> 02:39:47.533
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

5832
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:48.583
<v Speaker 2>this is what he said.</v>

5833
02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:49.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's true.</v>

5834
02:39:49.700 --> 02:39:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a geologist,</v>

5835
02:39:51.110 --> 02:39:51.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an oil.</v>

5836
02:39:52.010 --> 02:39:55.370
<v Speaker 2>He says that a peak oil,</v>

5837
02:39:55.430 --> 02:39:58.790
<v Speaker 2>like the scare that we're going to run out of oil is perpetrated.</v>

5838
02:39:58.791 --> 02:40:01.760
<v Speaker 2>That's it is perpetrated by the oil industry.</v>

5839
02:40:01.761 --> 02:40:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Says oil is the second most abundant liquid in the world,</v>

5840
02:40:05.241 --> 02:40:06.490
<v Speaker 2>and oils everywhere.</v>

5841
02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:07.670
<v Speaker 2>We'll never run out of it.</v>

5842
02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:08.660
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>

5843
02:40:08.660 --> 02:40:11.750
<v Speaker 2>if the people knew that then they wouldn't pay the prices.</v>

5844
02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:13.920
<v Speaker 2>They have to keep to keep the prices high.</v>

5845
02:40:14.130 --> 02:40:15.840
<v Speaker 1>They have to give it.</v>

5846
02:40:15.841 --> 02:40:17.160
<v Speaker 1>This is what this dude said.</v>

5847
02:40:17.190 --> 02:40:18.000
<v Speaker 1>He might be right.</v>

5848
02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:18.450
<v Speaker 1>But there's something,</v>

5849
02:40:18.450 --> 02:40:21.090
<v Speaker 1>there was a really interesting book that I read that I'm thinking about this</v>

5850
02:40:21.091 --> 02:40:22.780
<v Speaker 1>today because today I was thrown some,</v>

5851
02:40:22.950 --> 02:40:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I was given some books away actually to goodwill and we're putting them in boxes</v>

5852
02:40:26.051 --> 02:40:27.600
<v Speaker 1>of books that I've read that I'm not going to read again.</v>

5853
02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:31.470
<v Speaker 1>And one of them was black gold stranglehold and there's a really controversial</v>

5854
02:40:31.471 --> 02:40:32.190
<v Speaker 1>book that I read.</v>

5855
02:40:32.190 --> 02:40:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who wrote it.</v>

5856
02:40:33.241 --> 02:40:33.571
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

5857
02:40:33.571 --> 02:40:34.404
<v Speaker 1>see if you could pull that up,</v>

5858
02:40:34.590 --> 02:40:39.590
<v Speaker 1>but it was by a guy who was saying that oil is actually a natural process and</v>

5859
02:40:39.601 --> 02:40:43.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a natural process of the earth and that the idea that it was created by</v>

5860
02:40:43.501 --> 02:40:44.430
<v Speaker 1>fossils or,</v>

5861
02:40:44.490 --> 02:40:46.830
<v Speaker 1>and then later the theory was that plants,</v>

5862
02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:49.800
<v Speaker 1>plants like rotting would create this oil.</v>

5863
02:40:50.010 --> 02:40:54.030
<v Speaker 1>He said it's a natural process of the earth itself and it's constantly renewing.</v>

5864
02:40:54.330 --> 02:40:55.260
<v Speaker 1>It does kind of make sense,</v>

5865
02:40:55.261 --> 02:40:55.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5866
02:40:55.760 --> 02:40:57.270
<v Speaker 1>That's an l but you're proud of that.</v>

5867
02:40:57.271 --> 02:40:58.170
<v Speaker 1>He also said this to,</v>

5868
02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:03.320
<v Speaker 1>he said the reason we think it's a fossil fuel is because there John d</v>

5869
02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Rockefeller in 1890 2 cent a PA,</v>

5870
02:41:06.750 --> 02:41:10.590
<v Speaker 1>a group of paid off scientists to this big scientific community,</v>

5871
02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:15.450
<v Speaker 1>a committee on our organic matter in Geneva in 1892 he sent these scientists</v>

5872
02:41:15.540 --> 02:41:20.540
<v Speaker 1>just so that they can put in that petroleum is organic and it contains hydrogen,</v>

5873
02:41:20.580 --> 02:41:21.630
<v Speaker 1>oxygen and carbon,</v>

5874
02:41:21.810 --> 02:41:23.850
<v Speaker 1>so he knew that if they pass that,</v>

5875
02:41:23.940 --> 02:41:24.420
<v Speaker 1>then if it's,</v>

5876
02:41:24.420 --> 02:41:25.170
<v Speaker 1>if they could,</v>

5877
02:41:25.170 --> 02:41:27.240
<v Speaker 1>if he can say the petroleum is organic matter,</v>

5878
02:41:27.450 --> 02:41:29.520
<v Speaker 1>then people will believe that it's going to run out.</v>

5879
02:41:30.030 --> 02:41:31.560
<v Speaker 1>But it was all a complete hoax.</v>

5880
02:41:31.561 --> 02:41:32.790
<v Speaker 1>That's what El Fletcher Prouty.</v>

5881
02:41:32.850 --> 02:41:33.683
<v Speaker 1>You can get that book.</v>

5882
02:41:33.690 --> 02:41:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Here's dollars cheaper,</v>

5883
02:41:35.910 --> 02:41:36.743
<v Speaker 1>shared</v>

5884
02:41:38.850 --> 02:41:39.571
<v Speaker 1>oil,</v>

5885
02:41:39.571 --> 02:41:42.390
<v Speaker 1>trillions of gallons of oils.</v>

5886
02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:44.310
<v Speaker 1>A burst it up all over the world,</v>

5887
02:41:44.430 --> 02:41:46.860
<v Speaker 1>but you won't see it in American media because they,</v>

5888
02:41:47.070 --> 02:41:49.650
<v Speaker 1>they want everyone to think that it's not abundance.</v>

5889
02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:50.520
<v Speaker 1>It's so cheap.</v>

5890
02:41:50.521 --> 02:41:55.521
<v Speaker 1>We have so much oil in Alaska and all over the United States that it's cheaper</v>

5891
02:41:55.650 --> 02:41:57.270
<v Speaker 1>just to get it from the Middle East.</v>

5892
02:41:57.271 --> 02:41:58.140
<v Speaker 1>It's so much cheaper,</v>

5893
02:41:58.141 --> 02:42:00.810
<v Speaker 1>just like a cheaper to make products and China then to make it here.</v>

5894
02:42:00.811 --> 02:42:01.644
<v Speaker 1>We can make it here,</v>

5895
02:42:01.740 --> 02:42:04.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's way cheaper to just fucking make it a child on a second.</v>

5896
02:42:04.291 --> 02:42:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that most of the oil that we get is actually from fracking now and</v>

5897
02:42:07.970 --> 02:42:10.700
<v Speaker 1>then Millie says not where we get most of our or</v>

5898
02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:15.210
<v Speaker 1>changing now that that's part of his issue changing.</v>

5899
02:42:15.660 --> 02:42:17.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a big issue with fracking,</v>

5900
02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:18.810
<v Speaker 1>but according to this dude,</v>

5901
02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:19.560
<v Speaker 1>if you'd look at,</v>

5902
02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:20.760
<v Speaker 1>see that's the problem.</v>

5903
02:42:20.761 --> 02:42:22.200
<v Speaker 1>It's if it's one guy,</v>

5904
02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:23.011
<v Speaker 1>five minutes,</v>

5905
02:42:23.011 --> 02:42:23.680
<v Speaker 1>he talks about it,</v>

5906
02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:25.360
<v Speaker 1>but there's no way we're watching that.</v>

5907
02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:25.951
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking,</v>

5908
02:42:25.951 --> 02:42:26.940
<v Speaker 1>my head will explode.</v>

5909
02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Finding out now he might be right [inaudible] going on.</v>

5910
02:42:32.880 --> 02:42:34.770
<v Speaker 1>It's possible you don't want to hear that possible.</v>

5911
02:42:34.771 --> 02:42:37.410
<v Speaker 1>But if the case wouldn't you think,</v>

5912
02:42:37.650 --> 02:42:38.460
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

5913
02:42:38.460 --> 02:42:43.460
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that the myth of the earth creating oil through dead</v>

5914
02:42:43.501 --> 02:42:46.170
<v Speaker 1>things and it being a limited resource is possible.</v>

5915
02:42:46.171 --> 02:42:47.460
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why we know it's possible,</v>

5916
02:42:47.610 --> 02:42:51.000
<v Speaker 1>it's because whenever there's money to be made by manipulating the facts,</v>

5917
02:42:51.150 --> 02:42:52.950
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of people that are willing to do that.</v>

5918
02:42:52.951 --> 02:42:57.180
<v Speaker 1>And what we know about the most recent history is that the sugar industry paid</v>

5919
02:42:57.181 --> 02:43:02.181
<v Speaker 1>scientists untold amounts of money to lie and say that saturated fats were the</v>

5920
02:43:03.271 --> 02:43:06.870
<v Speaker 1>cause of heart disease and that take the blame off of sugar.</v>

5921
02:43:07.350 --> 02:43:08.310
<v Speaker 1>And this is a really,</v>

5922
02:43:08.311 --> 02:43:10.380
<v Speaker 1>this is a really recent study,</v>

5923
02:43:10.710 --> 02:43:13.090
<v Speaker 1>are recent rather a revelation.</v>

5924
02:43:13.091 --> 02:43:15.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm we're talking within the last couple of weeks documentary's called</v>

5925
02:43:15.950 --> 02:43:16.783
<v Speaker 1>sugarcoated.</v>

5926
02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Write that shit down.</v>

5927
02:43:17.710 --> 02:43:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Sugarcoat it on Netflix.</v>

5928
02:43:19.390 --> 02:43:23.620
<v Speaker 1>You'll see the scientists from Harvard,</v>

5929
02:43:23.740 --> 02:43:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Yale.</v>

5930
02:43:24.460 --> 02:43:28.240
<v Speaker 1>So when you find this out thanking the tobacco d the same thing when you hear</v>

5931
02:43:28.241 --> 02:43:29.320
<v Speaker 1>about tobacco science.</v>

5932
02:43:29.410 --> 02:43:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Tobacco science has paid off science,</v>

5933
02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:32.051
<v Speaker 1>Harvard,</v>

5934
02:43:32.051 --> 02:43:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Yale,</v>

5935
02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:33.700
<v Speaker 1>because they know people bullied.</v>

5936
02:43:33.701 --> 02:43:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Cause most people walk around and they'd go,</v>

5937
02:43:35.380 --> 02:43:36.213
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

5938
02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:37.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm into science bro.</v>

5939
02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm into science.</v>

5940
02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:39.400
<v Speaker 1>They know that.</v>

5941
02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:39.641
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

5942
02:43:39.641 --> 02:43:40.031
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5943
02:43:40.031 --> 02:43:40.870
<v Speaker 1>you're in the science.</v>

5944
02:43:41.020 --> 02:43:41.853
<v Speaker 1>We're going to pay.</v>

5945
02:43:41.990 --> 02:43:46.810
<v Speaker 1>They know they're going to pay off the scientist so we could fool these gullible</v>

5946
02:43:46.811 --> 02:43:47.530
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers.</v>

5947
02:43:47.530 --> 02:43:48.311
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going on.</v>

5948
02:43:48.311 --> 02:43:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's getting goalable.</v>

5949
02:43:49.380 --> 02:43:50.071
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>

5950
02:43:50.071 --> 02:43:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what's getting fooled left.</v>

5951
02:43:51.401 --> 02:43:52.234
<v Speaker 1>There's bright,</v>

5952
02:43:52.510 --> 02:43:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I can't see it as a camera in the way here.</v>

5953
02:43:53.981 --> 02:43:54.671
<v Speaker 1>Can you scroll up?</v>

5954
02:43:54.671 --> 02:43:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Please?</v>

5955
02:43:55.230 --> 02:43:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Says oil prices were about 60% lower than they were two years ago.</v>

5956
02:43:58.931 --> 02:44:03.931
<v Speaker 1>Yet BP reports us oil reserves are now at an all time high up to 55 billion</v>

5957
02:44:04.391 --> 02:44:04.871
<v Speaker 1>barrels,</v>

5958
02:44:04.871 --> 02:44:06.850
<v Speaker 1>nearly double what we had 20 years ago.</v>

5959
02:44:06.850 --> 02:44:10.690
<v Speaker 1>This search demonstrates how even our best experts are limited in their ability</v>

5960
02:44:10.691 --> 02:44:14.290
<v Speaker 1>to appreciate just how much oil we have and can produce.</v>

5961
02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:17.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's entirely possible that they were hoodwinked early on,</v>

5962
02:44:17.561 --> 02:44:21.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's also entirely possible that they pretended they knew how the fuck oil</v>

5963
02:44:21.821 --> 02:44:24.370
<v Speaker 1>was created in a way that it would benefit them.</v>

5964
02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:25.001
<v Speaker 1>I did say,</v>

5965
02:44:25.001 --> 02:44:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

5966
02:44:25.260 --> 02:44:26.410
<v Speaker 1>we have a limited supply.</v>

5967
02:44:26.590 --> 02:44:29.560
<v Speaker 1>So therefore we got to jet remembering this in the 1970s man,</v>

5968
02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:31.540
<v Speaker 1>when they fucked up our cars,</v>

5969
02:44:31.780 --> 02:44:34.390
<v Speaker 1>we had the dopest fucking muscle cars in the world,</v>

5970
02:44:34.391 --> 02:44:35.740
<v Speaker 1>like the American muscle cars,</v>

5971
02:44:35.741 --> 02:44:37.150
<v Speaker 1>the 1960s with a shit.</v>

5972
02:44:37.270 --> 02:44:38.890
<v Speaker 1>But then when Jimmy Carter got an office,</v>

5973
02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:40.060
<v Speaker 1>they sense weakness.</v>

5974
02:44:40.210 --> 02:44:41.440
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the fuckers Jack,</v>

5975
02:44:41.441 --> 02:44:42.760
<v Speaker 1>the oil rates up through the roof.</v>

5976
02:44:42.850 --> 02:44:43.810
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>

5977
02:44:43.870 --> 02:44:46.270
<v Speaker 1>we got mustangs that looked like dog shit.</v>

5978
02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:47.150
<v Speaker 1>Completely Golf.</v>

5979
02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Of course power such proudly,</v>

5980
02:44:49.310 --> 02:44:49.870
<v Speaker 1>proudly.</v>

5981
02:44:49.870 --> 02:44:52.000
<v Speaker 1>He said that was all part of the game.</v>

5982
02:44:52.210 --> 02:44:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Make it seem like there's a shortage caused chaos in the United States.</v>

5983
02:44:56.950 --> 02:44:58.930
<v Speaker 1>It was all part of the program.</v>

5984
02:44:59.050 --> 02:45:03.070
<v Speaker 1>That's how they get the prices of all a barrels show goddamn high.</v>

5985
02:45:03.071 --> 02:45:06.150
<v Speaker 1>If people knew that oil was lever going to run out,</v>

5986
02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:07.420
<v Speaker 1>this is what l Fletcher Prouty said.</v>

5987
02:45:07.570 --> 02:45:08.680
<v Speaker 1>If this one dude though,</v>

5988
02:45:08.681 --> 02:45:12.160
<v Speaker 1>let's Fletcher Prouty debunk Google him.</v>

5989
02:45:12.600 --> 02:45:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5990
02:45:12.910 --> 02:45:14.260
<v Speaker 1>just Google that bunch.</v>

5991
02:45:17.890 --> 02:45:18.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5992
02:45:18.161 --> 02:45:18.820
<v Speaker 1>you never know.</v>

5993
02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5994
02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:20.440
<v Speaker 1>But you don't say,</v>

5995
02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:24.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'd want to know whether he's right or whether he's crazy.</v>

5996
02:45:24.221 --> 02:45:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5997
02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:29.130
<v Speaker 1>So it's good to find something [inaudible] Kennedy assassinated.</v>

5998
02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:30.821
<v Speaker 1>You know you,</v>

5999
02:45:30.821 --> 02:45:31.750
<v Speaker 1>you might be right.</v>

6000
02:45:31.780 --> 02:45:32.700
<v Speaker 1>You must be roles.</v>

6001
02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:33.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6002
02:45:33.100 --> 02:45:37.120
<v Speaker 1>you might be right or they might be legitimate scientists that are proposing a</v>

6003
02:45:37.121 --> 02:45:37.750
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

6004
02:45:37.750 --> 02:45:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Exactly know what he's talking about.</v>

6005
02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:40.210
<v Speaker 1>That's impossible.</v>

6006
02:45:40.210 --> 02:45:41.380
<v Speaker 1>That's entirely possible too.</v>

6007
02:45:41.381 --> 02:45:42.280
<v Speaker 1>You never in this one guy,</v>

6008
02:45:42.281 --> 02:45:43.060
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of guys,</v>

6009
02:45:43.060 --> 02:45:44.790
<v Speaker 1>but you keep bringing up this one guy.</v>

6010
02:45:45.710 --> 02:45:46.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll go on,</v>

6011
02:45:46.410 --> 02:45:46.930
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>

6012
02:45:46.930 --> 02:45:47.763
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>

6013
02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:51.821
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

6014
02:45:51.821 --> 02:45:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

6015
02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>

6016
02:45:53.050 --> 02:45:54.730

6107
02:48:31.640 --> 02:48:32.380
<v Speaker 1>I like to go,</v>

6108
02:48:32.380 --> 02:48:33.710
<v Speaker 1>I read some time ago,</v>

6109
02:48:33.740 --> 02:48:34.573
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

6110
02:48:34.580 --> 02:48:35.091
<v Speaker 1>And then I go,</v>

6111
02:48:35.091 --> 02:48:35.924
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

6112
02:48:36.110 --> 02:48:36.980
<v Speaker 1>who else has this?</v>

6113
02:48:36.981 --> 02:48:38.060
<v Speaker 1>And then I go online.</v>

6114
02:48:38.090 --> 02:48:38.923
<v Speaker 1>I Google it.</v>

6115
02:48:38.970 --> 02:48:39.291
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

6116
02:48:39.291 --> 02:48:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

6117
02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:41.240
<v Speaker 1>I read a bunch of different written,</v>

6118
02:48:41.241 --> 02:48:42.830
<v Speaker 1>this is all from being wrong.</v>

6119
02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:46.490
<v Speaker 1>This is all from getting committed to an idea and then finding out it's not</v>

6120
02:48:46.491 --> 02:48:46.910
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

6121
02:48:46.910 --> 02:48:49.640
<v Speaker 1>So then I go to a bunch of different ones and then want to go to a bunch of</v>

6122
02:48:49.641 --> 02:48:50.474
<v Speaker 1>different ones.</v>

6123
02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:55.480
<v Speaker 1>I tried to figure out what the fuck is really going on outside where you look</v>

6124
02:48:56.370 --> 02:48:56.930
<v Speaker 1>and you go,</v>

6125
02:48:56.930 --> 02:48:57.530
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

6126
02:48:57.530 --> 02:48:58.363
<v Speaker 1>there's no credible,</v>

6127
02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:00.690
<v Speaker 1>credible CNN both.</v>

6128
02:49:00.770 --> 02:49:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>

6129
02:49:01.370 --> 02:49:02.360
<v Speaker 1>CNN has been wrong.</v>

6130
02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:03.920
<v Speaker 1>They've been wrong about Bengazi.</v>

6131
02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that they were wrong about information that Hillary Clinton had</v>

6132
02:49:07.891 --> 02:49:08.070
<v Speaker 1>for</v>

6133
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:10.110
<v Speaker 5>sure they're wrong about information the government had.</v>

6134
02:49:10.230 --> 02:49:14.100
<v Speaker 5>They have a limited amount of access to the actual facts of very complicated</v>

6135
02:49:14.101 --> 02:49:16.290
<v Speaker 5>issues like all journalists,</v>

6136
02:49:16.500 --> 02:49:19.920
<v Speaker 5>all journalists dealing with top secret issues have a limited amount of facts.</v>

6137
02:49:20.190 --> 02:49:22.740
<v Speaker 5>So you have to figure out who's biased.</v>

6138
02:49:22.890 --> 02:49:24.780
<v Speaker 5>Do you know Fox News is biased towards the right?</v>

6139
02:49:24.810 --> 02:49:25.890
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

6140
02:49:25.891 --> 02:49:28.170
<v Speaker 5>Is Msnbc bias towards the left?</v>

6141
02:49:28.230 --> 02:49:29.370
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

6142
02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:31.920
<v Speaker 5>Where's salon.com fit in far left?</v>

6143
02:49:31.921 --> 02:49:34.200
<v Speaker 5>Where's drudge.com far right?</v>

6144
02:49:34.290 --> 02:49:35.123
<v Speaker 5>Who's right?</v>

6145
02:49:35.130 --> 02:49:35.820
<v Speaker 5>Who's right?</v>

6146
02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:36.001
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

6147
02:49:36.001 --> 02:49:36.660
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing.</v>

6148
02:49:36.660 --> 02:49:41.660
<v Speaker 5>Don't fucking have an opinion until you look at all of it because there's a lot</v>

6149
02:49:42.391 --> 02:49:44.490
<v Speaker 5>of bullshit and shenanigans going on,</v>

6150
02:49:44.550 --> 02:49:46.080
<v Speaker 5>on both sides,</v>

6151
02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:50.490
<v Speaker 5>and sometimes it takes a while to figure out what the fuck is right and what's</v>

6152
02:49:50.491 --> 02:49:51.060
<v Speaker 5>wrong.</v>

6153
02:49:51.060 --> 02:49:53.580
<v Speaker 5>The problem is confirmation bias is a real thing.</v>

6154
02:49:53.581 --> 02:49:54.301
<v Speaker 5>I've had it.</v>

6155
02:49:54.301 --> 02:49:54.991
<v Speaker 5>You've had it.</v>

6156
02:49:54.991 --> 02:49:55.824
<v Speaker 5>We've all had it.</v>

6157
02:49:55.890 --> 02:49:58.650
<v Speaker 5>We've all wanted Dan Henderson to win.</v>

6158
02:49:58.710 --> 02:49:59.543
<v Speaker 5>We all,</v>

6159
02:49:59.700 --> 02:50:00.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6160
02:50:00.170 --> 02:50:04.950
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] sometimes when you see a fight like that,</v>

6161
02:50:04.951 --> 02:50:06.600
<v Speaker 5>and I've been guilty of the same thing myself.</v>

6162
02:50:06.601 --> 02:50:07.960
<v Speaker 5>You see a fight like that and you say,</v>

02:50:19.110 --> 02:50:21.810
<v Speaker 5>fucking Conor McGregor was running bro.</v>

6171
02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:22.310
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

6172
02:50:22.310 --> 02:50:22.710
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

6173
02:50:22.710 --> 02:50:23.610
<v Speaker 5>it's going to happen.</v>

6174
02:50:23.611 --> 02:50:24.444
<v Speaker 5>It's inevitable.</v>

6175
02:50:24.450 --> 02:50:25.290
<v Speaker 5>But our boy Eddie,</v>

6176
02:50:25.540 --> 02:50:25.960
<v Speaker 10>hmm,</v>

6177
02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:26.651
<v Speaker 10>he loves him.</v>

6178
02:50:26.651 --> 02:50:30.100
<v Speaker 10>Something spiritually and I pulled up is from John c Mcadams,</v>

6179
02:50:30.101 --> 02:50:34.840
<v Speaker 10>who also wrote a book on the JFK assassination called JFK Sass and logic,</v>

6180
02:50:34.841 --> 02:50:37.090
<v Speaker 10>how to think about claims of conspiracy.</v>

6181
02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:39.670
<v Speaker 10>He described himself as a debunker by temperament.</v>

6182
02:50:39.671 --> 02:50:39.971
<v Speaker 10>And then,</v>

6183
02:50:39.971 --> 02:50:44.971
<v Speaker 10>so I found the page where he breaks down this Fletcher Guy and he's not talking</v>

6184
02:50:45.401 --> 02:50:47.380
<v Speaker 10>about the specific oil thing,</v>

6185
02:50:47.381 --> 02:50:51.040
<v Speaker 10>but he does take us a topic or a version of a story.</v>

6186
02:50:51.490 --> 02:50:52.323
<v Speaker 10>Proudy has,</v>

6187
02:50:52.520 --> 02:50:53.420
<v Speaker 5>how'd he comes back in?</v>

6188
02:50:53.421 --> 02:50:53.961
<v Speaker 5>You'd say,</v>

<v Speaker 5>not a word of this cause I don't want to get back fucked up Gremlin,</v>

6190

<v Speaker 5>but they call him proudly isms.</v>

6191
02:51:02.270 --> 02:51:03.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is what he's known for,</v>

6192
02:51:03.411 --> 02:51:04.550
<v Speaker 5>the sweet he's made his career on.</v>

6193
02:51:04.551 --> 02:51:06.890
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like these conspiracy theories.</v>

6194
02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:07.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

6207
02:51:35.810 --> 02:51:37.460
<v Speaker 5>It's like him running up the mountain,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It was the highest.</v>

6303
02:54:03.060 --> 02:54:04.930
<v Speaker 4>That was our highest snowboarding point.</v>

6304
02:54:05.320 --> 02:54:08.560
<v Speaker 4>And there's all these loose rocks and you're thinking the whole time I told,</v>

6305
02:54:08.620 --> 02:54:09.400
<v Speaker 4>I told him,</v>

6306
02:54:09.400 --> 02:54:10.000
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

6307
02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:11.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm here to teach you Jujitsu.</v>

6308
02:54:11.830 --> 02:54:13.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm not here to run a fucking marathon,</v>

6309
02:54:13.540 --> 02:54:14.020
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

6310
02:54:14.020 --> 02:54:14.261

02:54:14.261 --> 02:54:15.094
<v Speaker 4>come up to the match.</v>

6312
02:54:15.460 --> 02:54:15.791
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

6313
02:54:15.791 --> 02:54:16.261
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>

6314
02:54:16.261 --> 02:54:18.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do some emails at the cabin.</v>

6315
02:54:18.910 --> 02:54:21.130
<v Speaker 4>We got a lot of hatchet man.</v>

6316
02:54:21.130 --> 02:54:21.570
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

6317
02:54:21.570 --> 02:54:22.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be a pussy.</v>

6318
02:54:22.571 --> 02:54:23.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't want him like I gotta.</v>

6319
02:54:23.980 --> 02:54:24.813
<v Speaker 4>I gotta look like,</v>

6320
02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:25.111
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

6321
02:54:25.111 --> 02:54:25.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6322
02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:27.610
<v Speaker 4>at least have a medium sized balls.</v>

6323
02:54:27.611 --> 02:54:28.420
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

6324
02:54:28.420 --> 02:54:28.841
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like,</v>

6325
02:54:28.841 --> 02:54:29.291
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

6326
02:54:29.291 --> 02:54:29.890
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>

6327
02:54:29.890 --> 02:54:33.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm had vans on I a vans on and we climbed his fucking,</v>

6328
02:54:33.910 --> 02:54:34.360
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

6329
02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:35.230
<v Speaker 4>we're not supposed to.</v>

6330
02:54:35.260 --> 02:54:36.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we're supposed to go to bear mountain.</v>

6331
02:54:36.971 --> 02:54:39.220
<v Speaker 4>We just parked and just climbed up that motherfucker.</v>

6332
02:54:40.570 --> 02:54:41.403
<v Speaker 4>You supposed to,</v>

6333
02:54:41.800 --> 02:54:45.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if people aren't allowed to Kike as snowboarding resort,</v>

6334
02:54:45.700 --> 02:54:46.181
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

6335
02:54:46.181 --> 02:54:48.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure is no snowboarding.</v>

6336
02:54:48.220 --> 02:54:50.320
<v Speaker 4>I think you'd probably get away with it might be private land though.</v>

6337
02:54:50.321 --> 02:54:50.501
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

6338
02:54:50.501 --> 02:54:54.310
<v Speaker 4>So the biggest misconception for those climbers is when you're climbing up and</v>

6339
02:54:54.311 --> 02:54:54.700
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

6340
02:54:54.700 --> 02:54:55.361
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

6341
02:54:55.361 --> 02:54:56.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I'm going to make this shit.</v>

6342
02:54:57.490 --> 02:54:59.170
<v Speaker 4>These mounts are pussy compared to your shit.</v>

6343
02:54:59.170 --> 02:55:00.370
<v Speaker 4>But for me as a civilian,</v>

6344
02:55:00.460 --> 02:55:02.350
<v Speaker 4>this was the fucking track man.</v>

6345
02:55:02.351 --> 02:55:03.500
<v Speaker 4>It was like eight of us.</v>

6346
02:55:03.620 --> 02:55:04.430
<v Speaker 4>How long did it take?</v>

6347
02:55:04.430 --> 02:55:05.900
<v Speaker 4>It was like we're climbing Mount Everest.</v>

6348
02:55:05.930 --> 02:55:07.210
<v Speaker 4>It took us to,</v>

6349
02:55:07.220 --> 02:55:07.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6350
02:55:07.450 --> 02:55:09.320
<v Speaker 4>to me it was Mount Everest and I'm thinking the whole time,</v>

6351
02:55:09.500 --> 02:55:11.450
<v Speaker 4>at least when we get up going down,</v>

6352
02:55:11.451 --> 02:55:12.320
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be easy.</v>

6353
02:55:12.410 --> 02:55:14.600
<v Speaker 4>That's the biggest misconception going down.</v>

6354
02:55:14.630 --> 02:55:16.220
<v Speaker 4>Works a whole different part of your legs.</v>

6355
02:55:16.550 --> 02:55:18.050
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

6356
02:55:18.230 --> 02:55:20.210
<v Speaker 4>Going down is not easy.</v>

6357
02:55:20.390 --> 02:55:20.850
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

6358
02:55:20.850 --> 02:55:23.000
<v Speaker 4>it's just as hard in a whole different way.</v>

6359
02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:24.020
<v Speaker 4>How long did it take?</v>

6360
02:55:24.890 --> 02:55:26.590
<v Speaker 4>We all Goddamn day we were up there.</v>

6361
02:55:27.230 --> 02:55:29.290
<v Speaker 4>That's a warm up and there.</v>

6362
02:55:29.380 --> 02:55:30.410
<v Speaker 4>There's bees everywhere.</v>

6363
02:55:33.660 --> 02:55:34.493
<v Speaker 4>All God.</v>

6364
02:55:35.700 --> 02:55:36.950
<v Speaker 4>When the sun,</v>

6365
02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:37.740
<v Speaker 4>when we,</v>

6366
02:55:37.740 --> 02:55:41.930
<v Speaker 4>we got to the bottom of the mountain right when the sun went down and man,</v>

6367
02:55:41.960 --> 02:55:42.793
<v Speaker 4>but just one day,</v>

6368
02:55:43.040 --> 02:55:43.600
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

6369
02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:44.600
<v Speaker 4>you know what again,</v>

6370
02:55:44.630 --> 02:55:45.290
<v Speaker 4>to you,</v>

6371
02:55:45.290 --> 02:55:45.950
<v Speaker 4>that's some,</v>

6372
02:55:45.950 --> 02:55:46.700
<v Speaker 4>we did some,</v>

6373
02:55:46.700 --> 02:55:50.990
<v Speaker 4>we did a white belt workshop in Cancun and it was,</v>

6374
02:55:50.991 --> 02:55:54.170
<v Speaker 4>I know that slow and listen,</v>

6375
02:55:54.171 --> 02:55:55.010
<v Speaker 4>don't get me wrong,</v>

6376
02:55:55.250 --> 02:55:58.550
<v Speaker 4>I was in the boy scouts for two fucking years growing up.</v>

6377
02:55:58.670 --> 02:56:00.140
<v Speaker 4>So if it wasn't for that training,</v>

6378
02:56:00.690 --> 02:56:01.523
<v Speaker 4>there's</v>

6379
02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:03.273
<v Speaker 4>6,000</v>

6380
02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:05.990
<v Speaker 4>seriously,</v>

6381
02:56:05.990 --> 02:56:07.160
<v Speaker 4>two years of boy scouts.</v>

6382
02:56:07.250 --> 02:56:07.981
<v Speaker 4>But the way I did,</v>

6383
02:56:07.981 --> 02:56:08.791
<v Speaker 4>I put a list out,</v>

6384
02:56:08.791 --> 02:56:13.440

<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

6386
02:56:15.410 --> 02:56:16.011

<v Speaker 4>75.</v>

6416
02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:11.840
<v Speaker 4>He was one and he did a hundred miles and then he realized it was too much</v>

6417
02:57:11.841 --> 02:57:12.410
<v Speaker 4>weight.</v>

02:57:59.810 --> 02:58:01.890
<v Speaker 4>Look at that 2.8 million.</v>

6446
02:58:02.380 --> 02:58:03.660
<v Speaker 4>His fucking videos.</v>

6447
02:58:03.900 --> 02:58:08.640
<v Speaker 4>So the Cameron Hanes one I think had something like 300 how many thousand likes</v>

6448
02:58:08.920 --> 02:58:11.730
<v Speaker 4>for 420,000 likes.</v>

6449
02:58:11.820 --> 02:58:12.001
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

6450
02:58:12.001 --> 02:58:14.650
<v Speaker 4>powerful for 24 minutes.</v>

6451
02:58:16.440 --> 02:58:18.360
<v Speaker 4>What if Instagram goes down like my space,</v>

6452
02:58:19.230 --> 02:58:20.063
<v Speaker 4>all those followers,</v>

6453
02:58:20.080 --> 02:58:20.910
<v Speaker 4>all that business.</v>

6454
02:58:20.910 --> 02:58:22.230
<v Speaker 4>What happened could happen.</v>

6455
02:58:22.650 --> 02:58:26.010
<v Speaker 4>That's the same thing that people are saying about Twitter is that Twitter is</v>

6456
02:58:26.011 --> 02:58:27.030
<v Speaker 4>starting to drop off.</v>

6457
02:58:27.031 --> 02:58:28.410
<v Speaker 4>But Instagram started to pick up</v>

6458
02:58:30.320 --> 02:58:33.900
<v Speaker 4>an apple thing because they can cause they add to kind of chat.</v>

6459
02:58:33.901 --> 02:58:35.340
<v Speaker 4>Apparently haven't jumped on that.</v>

6460
02:58:35.341 --> 02:58:39.390
<v Speaker 4>Snapchat got off for like 16 benefit of that over regular Instagram.</v>

6461
02:58:39.391 --> 02:58:39.900
<v Speaker 4>Explain it.</v>

6462
02:58:39.900 --> 02:58:40.561
<v Speaker 4>It's just a story.</v>

6463
02:58:40.561 --> 02:58:42.330
<v Speaker 4>So you can post this story.</v>

6464
02:58:42.350 --> 02:58:42.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6465
02:58:42.600 --> 02:58:42.870
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

6466
02:58:42.870 --> 02:58:43.051
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6467
02:58:43.051 --> 02:58:45.210
<v Speaker 4>it's real quick so it doesn't last forever.</v>

6468
02:58:45.270 --> 02:58:48.390
<v Speaker 4>So he could post 20 insta pictures.</v>

6469
02:58:49.100 --> 02:58:53.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing an Insta story of you guys talking about [inaudible] so it's just like</v>

6470
02:58:53.791 --> 02:58:54.270
<v Speaker 4>quick,</v>

6471
02:58:54.270 --> 02:58:56.250
<v Speaker 4>I haven't felt the need to do that for some reason.</v>

6472
02:58:56.251 --> 02:58:56.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why.</v>

6473
02:58:56.990 --> 02:58:58.560
<v Speaker 4>Cause if you're gonna post something like whatever,</v>

6474
02:58:58.561 --> 02:59:01.470
<v Speaker 4>something's kind of silly or not that not a great picture,</v>

6475
02:59:01.550 --> 02:59:02.470
<v Speaker 4>which wasn't a story.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Too verbose.</v>

6493
02:59:35.400 --> 02:59:37.830
<v Speaker 4>It's too embarrassing when it's small.</v>

6494
02:59:37.860 --> 02:59:38.880
<v Speaker 4>Too verbose.</v>

03:00:15.811 --> 03:00:16.641
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of Asians.</v>

6517
03:00:16.641 --> 03:00:18.420
<v Speaker 4>Asians are the smartest people in the world.</v>

6518
03:00:18.421 --> 03:00:19.950
<v Speaker 4>They're the ones programming everything.</v>

6519
03:00:19.951 --> 03:00:22.500
<v Speaker 4>That's why I say you agents out there in San Jose.</v>

<v Speaker 4>How was that?</v>

6523
03:00:29.580 --> 03:00:31.050
<v Speaker 4>Black guys have big dicks.</v>

6524
03:00:31.080 --> 03:00:31.913
<v Speaker 4>How was that?</v>

6525

<v Speaker 4>I was Mexican.</v>

6526
03:00:33.301 --> 03:00:35.220
<v Speaker 4>I wish that was a Mexican stereotype that,</v>

<v Speaker 4>if it was a Mexican third type that we had gigantic Dick's dude,</v>

6533

6794
03:08:42.240 --> 03:08:43.073
<v Speaker 4>Weak frame.</v>

6795
03:08:43.660 --> 03:08:44.580
<v Speaker 4>Do you know the one thing,</v>

6796
03:08:44.640 --> 03:08:48.890
<v Speaker 4>the one thing that over the last year I used to think that when people would say</v>

6797
03:08:49.260 --> 03:08:54.030
<v Speaker 4>like seed links and videos and stuff about celebrities being,</v>

6798
03:08:54.090 --> 03:08:59.090
<v Speaker 4>you get loose celebrities being part of the establishment.</v>

6799
03:08:59.880 --> 03:09:03.660
<v Speaker 4>And the agenda 21 like celebrities,</v>

6800
03:09:03.750 --> 03:09:03.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6801
03:09:03.931 --> 03:09:04.764
<v Speaker 4>part of it.</v>

6802
03:09:04.860 --> 03:09:05.071
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

6803
03:09:05.071 --> 03:09:06.180
<v Speaker 4>but over the last year,</v>

6804
03:09:06.181 --> 03:09:06.451
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

6805
03:09:06.451 --> 03:09:07.284
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

6806
03:09:07.380 --> 03:09:08.031
<v Speaker 4>it seems.</v>

6807
03:09:08.031 --> 03:09:08.864
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6808
03:09:08.970 --> 03:09:11.220
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about Robert De Niro making that video about Trump?</v>

6809
03:09:11.560 --> 03:09:12.393
<v Speaker 4>I don't give him,</v>

6810
03:09:12.480 --> 03:09:14.970
<v Speaker 4>I think he was irresponsible because it,</v>

6811
03:09:14.971 --> 03:09:17.400
<v Speaker 4>he should've said vote for the Libertarian Guy.</v>

6812
03:09:17.640 --> 03:09:19.410
<v Speaker 4>And he was like trying to sway people to Hillary.</v>

6813
03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:23.310
<v Speaker 4>I think Hillary's clear.</v>

6814
03:09:23.400 --> 03:09:24.630
<v Speaker 4>He should've made why?</v>

6815
03:09:27.540 --> 03:09:29.370
<v Speaker 4>He's talking shit on Trump.</v>

6816
03:09:29.730 --> 03:09:31.920
<v Speaker 4>Talk Shit on the Hillary to the fuck you doing.</v>

6817
03:09:32.010 --> 03:09:33.630
<v Speaker 4>You're going to push everybody to Hillary.</v>

6818
03:09:33.700 --> 03:09:34.533
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

6819
03:09:35.400 --> 03:09:36.270
<v Speaker 4>that's dangerous.</v>

6820
03:09:38.190 --> 03:09:39.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about Robert De Niro.</v>

6821
03:09:39.390 --> 03:09:40.710
<v Speaker 4>He's talking mad shit.</v>

6822
03:09:40.770 --> 03:09:42.360
<v Speaker 4>No one's ever fucking done that before.</v>

03:09:42.480 --> 03:09:43.290
<v Speaker 4>Get all right.</v>

6825
03:09:44.490 --> 03:09:46.170
<v Speaker 4>He thinks he's the dude from raging bull.</v>

6826
03:09:46.510 --> 03:09:47.490
<v Speaker 4>Put you in the face.</v>

6832
03:09:59.530 --> 03:10:01.050

6841
03:10:16.300 --> 03:10:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Of course he says Trump's words to not hurt anyone.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

6855
03:10:37.510 --> 03:10:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Here's my question.</v>

6856
03:10:38.470 --> 03:10:39.101
<v Speaker 1>Here's my question.</v>

6857
03:10:39.101 --> 03:10:40.240
<v Speaker 1>This is a legitimate question.</v>

6858
03:10:40.780 --> 03:10:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that until the internet came around and we were able to see like</v>

6859
03:10:46.361 --> 03:10:49.000
<v Speaker 1>all the different influences on political processes,</v>

6860
03:10:49.120 --> 03:10:50.230
<v Speaker 1>special interest groups,</v>

6861
03:10:50.231 --> 03:10:50.840
<v Speaker 1>lobbyists,</v>

6862
03:10:50.840 --> 03:10:51.673
<v Speaker 1>all that kind of stuff,</v>

6863
03:10:51.850 --> 03:10:54.640
<v Speaker 1>all these different things that we didn't know whether or not we're real,</v>

6864
03:10:54.641 --> 03:10:56.260
<v Speaker 1>we all get to see it sort of consolidated.</v>

6865
03:10:56.260 --> 03:10:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6866
03:10:56.980 --> 03:11:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that these people that are here,</v>

6867
03:11:00.520 --> 03:11:01.750
<v Speaker 1>these longterm people,</v>

6868
03:11:01.751 --> 03:11:04.450
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to name them because anybody that's deeply entrenched in the</v>

6869
03:11:04.451 --> 03:11:06.010
<v Speaker 1>system for 2030 years,</v>

6870
03:11:06.310 --> 03:11:11.310
<v Speaker 1>they were used to operating back in like the fucking Reagan days,</v>

6871
03:11:11.531 --> 03:11:12.100
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6872
03:11:12.100 --> 03:11:12.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6873
03:11:12.521 --> 03:11:13.450
<v Speaker 1>they were around.</v>

6874
03:11:13.451 --> 03:11:13.811
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

6875
03:11:13.811 --> 03:11:17.680
<v Speaker 1>they were getting into the mix back when they were kids.</v>

6876
03:11:18.040 --> 03:11:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Carter was president.</v>

6877
03:11:19.361 --> 03:11:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Ford was president.</v>

6878
03:11:20.561 --> 03:11:20.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6879
03:11:20.771 --> 03:11:21.850
<v Speaker 1>when they were in college,</v>

6880
03:11:21.970 --> 03:11:23.140
<v Speaker 1>they went to the Vietnam War.</v>

6881
03:11:23.460 --> 03:11:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

6882
03:11:23.920 --> 03:11:24.431
<v Speaker 1>here's that.</v>

6883
03:11:24.431 --> 03:11:26.020
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with all of them.</v>

6884
03:11:26.190 --> 03:11:27.540
<v Speaker 1>So when she went from Donald,</v>

6885
03:11:27.730 --> 03:11:27.941
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

6886
03:11:27.941 --> 03:11:31.420
<v Speaker 1>you could look all down the list of all the different people that have been</v>

6887
03:11:31.421 --> 03:11:34.840
<v Speaker 1>involved in American politics over the last few years.</v>

6888
03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:38.050
<v Speaker 1>And most of them got their start a long time ago.</v>

6889
03:11:38.051 --> 03:11:40.240
<v Speaker 1>They get deeply entrenched in the system,</v>

6890
03:11:40.690 --> 03:11:40.991
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

6891
03:11:40.991 --> 03:11:45.670
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that this system is so fucking weird.</v>

6892
03:11:45.730 --> 03:11:49.360
<v Speaker 1>And there's so many loopholes as to what's legal and what's not legal.</v>

6893
03:11:49.990 --> 03:11:53.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not about doing what's right or doing what's good for the American people</v>

6894
03:11:53.700 --> 03:11:54.560
<v Speaker 1>is amount is,</v>

6895
03:11:54.930 --> 03:11:55.240
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6896
03:11:55.240 --> 03:11:57.910
<v Speaker 1>you're competing with all these other people that are doing the same thing.</v>

6897
03:11:58.730 --> 03:12:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Probably the biggest problem going on,</v>

6898
03:12:01.210 --> 03:12:02.200
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion.</v>

6899
03:12:02.380 --> 03:12:03.730
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a fucking idiot.</v>

6900
03:12:04.090 --> 03:12:04.361
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

6901
03:12:04.361 --> 03:12:05.194
<v Speaker 1>how many idiot?</v>

6902
03:12:05.380 --> 03:12:08.080
<v Speaker 1>But the biggest problem in my fucking opinion,</v>

6903
03:12:08.580 --> 03:12:11.320
<v Speaker 1>show easily to honey Dick,</v>

6904
03:12:11.470 --> 03:12:12.340
<v Speaker 1>the masses,</v>

6905
03:12:12.460 --> 03:12:13.960
<v Speaker 1>the masses have all the power.</v>

6906
03:12:14.020 --> 03:12:15.580
<v Speaker 1>We see it in the weed movement.</v>

6907
03:12:15.670 --> 03:12:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Weed's being legalized in the feds don't want that shit,</v>

6908
03:12:18.250 --> 03:12:20.800
<v Speaker 1>but the people are waking up to at least weed,</v>

6909
03:12:20.980 --> 03:12:23.200
<v Speaker 1>but they won't wake up to all the rest of the shit.</v>

6910
03:12:23.380 --> 03:12:24.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the fucking problem.</v>

6911
03:12:24.730 --> 03:12:28.450
<v Speaker 1>The people that are gullible and they just buy all this shit.</v>

6912
03:12:28.780 --> 03:12:29.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

6913
03:12:30.070 --> 03:12:30.970
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

6914
03:12:30.971 --> 03:12:31.181
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6915
03:12:31.181 --> 03:12:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Then wake the fuck up.</v>

6916
03:12:33.820 --> 03:12:34.451
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

6917
03:12:34.451 --> 03:12:36.000
<v Speaker 1>God Damn problem over president.</v>

6918
03:12:36.010 --> 03:12:37.330
<v Speaker 1>That's the fucking problem.</v>

6919
03:12:37.390 --> 03:12:38.223
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

6920
03:12:38.320 --> 03:12:39.400
<v Speaker 1>my question is,</v>

6921
03:12:39.401 --> 03:12:40.300
<v Speaker 1>you started that off with,</v>

6922
03:12:40.301 --> 03:12:41.140
<v Speaker 1>you had a question.</v>

6923
03:12:41.860 --> 03:12:42.700
<v Speaker 1>What was the question?</v>

6924
03:12:44.020 --> 03:12:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>

6925
03:12:44.290 --> 03:12:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh my question Jamie Brown.</v>

6926
03:12:46.810 --> 03:12:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's talking about the reason why we have Donald Trump,</v>

6927
03:12:49.360 --> 03:12:52.160
<v Speaker 1>can we assume that video is done is because</v>

6928
03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:55.550
<v Speaker 4>everyone believes all the shit they see on TV.</v>

6929
03:12:56.270 --> 03:12:59.150
<v Speaker 4>This is a result of all the skeptic score.</v>

6930
03:12:59.390 --> 03:13:01.880
<v Speaker 4>There's no fucking proof that they're corrupt.</v>

6931
03:13:01.970 --> 03:13:03.170
<v Speaker 4>There's no fucking proof.</v>

6932
03:13:07.270 --> 03:13:07.960
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

6933
03:13:07.960 --> 03:13:12.960
<v Speaker 4>It's those mother fuckers in a trance paid or in a trance or Zappos mother</v>

6934
03:13:16.561 --> 03:13:17.394
<v Speaker 4>fuckers.</v>

6935
03:13:17.630 --> 03:13:19.820
<v Speaker 4>That's why were we got Hillary and Trump.</v>

6936
03:13:20.150 --> 03:13:22.760
<v Speaker 4>That's why you mother fuckers cause the you.</v>

6937
03:13:23.780 --> 03:13:24.320
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

6938
03:13:24.320 --> 03:13:25.153
<v Speaker 4>I'm done.</v>

6939
03:13:28.020 --> 03:13:29.480
<v Speaker 4>So I'll take a breath.</v>

6940
03:13:30.050 --> 03:13:30.980
<v Speaker 4>Think about what just happened.</v>

6941
03:13:36.680 --> 03:13:37.513
<v Speaker 4>We never saw the,</v>

6942
03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:39.530
<v Speaker 4>you guys haven't seen it.</v>

6943
03:13:39.560 --> 03:13:40.393
<v Speaker 4>I don't even want</v>

6944
03:13:46.520 --> 03:13:47.270
<v Speaker 4>to fuck up.</v>

6945
03:13:47.270 --> 03:13:49.550
<v Speaker 4>Whoever owns it for sure will get pulled off.</v>

6946
03:13:53.870 --> 03:13:55.750
<v Speaker 4>Can we talk about gangs?</v>

6947
03:13:55.760 --> 03:13:56.750
<v Speaker 4>Will Watch it off the air,</v>

6948
03:13:56.751 --> 03:13:58.730
<v Speaker 4>but whenever anything happens,</v>

6949
03:13:58.731 --> 03:13:59.870
<v Speaker 4>it's like a news story.</v>

6950
03:13:59.871 --> 03:14:02.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of the ways that video's getting pulled off of things.</v>

6951
03:14:02.721 --> 03:14:02.910
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

6952
03:14:02.910 --> 03:14:03.560

6956
03:14:10.860 --> 03:14:11.390
<v Speaker 4>they weren't,</v>

6957
03:14:11.390 --> 03:14:12.890
<v Speaker 4>they weren't posting for some reason.</v>

6958
03:14:12.891 --> 03:14:13.724
<v Speaker 4>Some of them weren't.</v>

6959
03:14:14.600 --> 03:14:15.750
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like they all got posted.</v>

6960
03:14:15.890 --> 03:14:16.200
<v Speaker 4>All of them.</v>

6961
03:14:16.200 --> 03:14:17.630
<v Speaker 4>Even with complaining about their,</v>

6962

03:14:38.320 --> 03:14:40.310
<v Speaker 4>This could have been fake.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You guys get a Photoshop that out for all I know.</v>

6985
03:14:43.220 --> 03:14:44.053
<v Speaker 4>It's like wheat,</v>

6986
03:14:44.570 --> 03:14:48.410
<v Speaker 4>wheat as an example of the power of the people and shows the UFC.</v>

6987
03:14:48.530 --> 03:14:51.190
<v Speaker 4>That was the power of the motherfucking people underground,</v>

6988
03:14:51.200 --> 03:14:52.850
<v Speaker 4>keeping it alive on direct TV.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

6992
03:14:54.740 --> 03:14:57.290
<v Speaker 4>that's an example that we do have the fucking power,</v>

6993
03:14:57.410 --> 03:14:58.580
<v Speaker 4>but we can't use it.</v>

6994
03:14:58.610 --> 03:15:01.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell you wake the fuck up then we could use it.</v>

6995
03:15:02.300 --> 03:15:04.250
<v Speaker 4>We can't use it until you wake up.</v>

6996
03:15:05.840 --> 03:15:09.500
<v Speaker 4>We did it with the weed and we did it with the UFC and then we got,</v>

6997
03:15:09.560 --> 03:15:09.951
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

<v Speaker 4>The Pentagon just got busted spending half a billion dollars on fake Taliban al</v>

<v Speaker 4>$500 million sake videos making like it's seed.</v>

03:15:53.071 --> 03:15:56.300
<v Speaker 4>it's so outrageous that I understand that solar ray just said like,</v>

7024
03:15:56.310 --> 03:15:59.340
<v Speaker 4>you need absolute proof that you saw it on Russia today.</v>

7025
03:16:00.180 --> 03:16:01.013
<v Speaker 4>Today.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's real.</v>

7027
03:16:01.980 --> 03:16:03.150
<v Speaker 4>It's actually real.</v>

7028
03:16:03.270 --> 03:16:04.370
<v Speaker 4>But I know you guys need to put,</v>

7029
03:16:04.380 --> 03:16:05.490
<v Speaker 4>because it's so crazy.</v>

7030
03:16:05.580 --> 03:16:06.480
<v Speaker 4>It's so insane.</v>

7031
03:16:06.481 --> 03:16:08.100
<v Speaker 4>Of course it's so insane.</v>

7032
03:16:08.370 --> 03:16:09.480
<v Speaker 4>But what the fuck of it?</v>

7033
03:16:09.890 --> 03:16:10.800
<v Speaker 4>If it's real,</v>

7034
03:16:12.060 --> 03:16:13.230
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck does that mean?</v>

7035
03:16:13.380 --> 03:16:16.410
<v Speaker 4>It means everything we see on TV is all programmed,</v>

7036
03:16:16.770 --> 03:16:17.820
<v Speaker 4>not like just some of it.</v>

7037
03:16:17.880 --> 03:16:19.500
<v Speaker 4>I trust them here and I trust them.</v>

7038
03:16:19.740 --> 03:16:21.080
<v Speaker 4>These are strains,</v>

7039
03:16:21.640 --> 03:16:22.610
<v Speaker 4>corruption,</v>

7040
03:16:22.920 --> 03:16:25.320
<v Speaker 4>straight brainwash,</v>

7041
03:16:25.380 --> 03:16:26.400
<v Speaker 4>mine control.</v>

<v Speaker 4>So don't tell him.</v>

7043
03:16:27.270 --> 03:16:30.780
<v Speaker 4>Tell me where you are getting your news from before you start talking.</v>

7044
03:16:30.970 --> 03:16:32.100

<v Speaker 4>what are you getting your fund?</v>

7046
03:16:33.090 --> 03:16:37.530
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it possible that even the news people are being deceived?</v>

7047
03:16:38.180 --> 03:16:38.850
<v Speaker 4>They're being,</v>

7048
03:16:38.850 --> 03:16:40.920
<v Speaker 4>they're being told what to do and what to say.</v>

7049
03:16:41.040 --> 03:16:41.851
<v Speaker 4>They're not involved.</v>

7050
03:16:41.851 --> 03:16:42.684
<v Speaker 4>So who's</v>

7051
03:16:44.010 --> 03:16:45.620
<v Speaker 4>the guy you see talking nick?</v>

7052
03:16:45.860 --> 03:16:47.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't have enough power.</v>

7053
03:16:48.230 --> 03:16:51.100
<v Speaker 4>I was talking about them because there's looking at the way it,</v>

7054
03:16:51.370 --> 03:16:52.320
<v Speaker 4>that's a good question.</v>

7055
03:16:52.380 --> 03:16:54.120
<v Speaker 4>There's also getting people behind the scene.</v>

7056
03:16:54.121 --> 03:16:54.954
<v Speaker 4>Great Court.</v>

7057
03:16:56.430 --> 03:16:58.590
<v Speaker 4>It's the same shit that we've gone through already,</v>

7058
03:16:58.890 --> 03:16:59.940
<v Speaker 4>but everywhere else,</v>

7059
03:17:00.270 --> 03:17:01.800
<v Speaker 4>everywhere else is just as corrupt.</v>

7060
03:17:02.520 --> 03:17:03.450
<v Speaker 4>So listen,</v>

7061
03:17:03.451 --> 03:17:05.850
<v Speaker 4>everyone's just sitting around and hope and everything's going to be fucking</v>

7062
03:17:05.851 --> 03:17:06.121

<v Speaker 4>But guess what?</v>

7064
03:17:06.900 --> 03:17:10.110
<v Speaker 4>We got Hillary and we've got Trump as candidates.</v>

7065
03:17:10.200 --> 03:17:12.660
<v Speaker 4>It's because motherfuckers just want to ignore it.</v>

7066
03:17:12.900 --> 03:17:13.740
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's about.</v>

7070
03:17:17.341 --> 03:17:18.990
<v Speaker 4>And I'd rather have Trump than Hillary.</v>

7071
03:17:19.080 --> 03:17:20.310
<v Speaker 4>I know Trump's full of shit.</v>

03:19:42.461 --> 03:19:43.750
<v Speaker 4>You just got to wake the fuck up.</v>

7155
03:19:43.751 --> 03:19:45.910
<v Speaker 4>People are changing public opinion,</v>

7156
03:19:46.150 --> 03:19:50.800
<v Speaker 4>which is what changes like public opinion sort of changes first and then policy</v>

7157
03:19:50.801 --> 03:19:51.634
<v Speaker 4>changes.</v>

7158
03:19:51.670 --> 03:19:53.200
<v Speaker 4>It just depends on your platform,</v>

7159
03:19:53.770 --> 03:19:55.630
<v Speaker 4>but it's also just getting the word out in the view.</v>

7160
03:19:55.631 --> 03:19:57.490
<v Speaker 4>Like look at Colin Kaepernick with his,</v>

7161
03:19:57.610 --> 03:19:59.230
<v Speaker 4>his Stan about it.</v>

7162
03:19:59.440 --> 03:20:00.490
<v Speaker 4>Whether you agree with it or not.</v>

7163
03:20:00.491 --> 03:20:02.290
<v Speaker 4>It's brought attention to the situation.</v>

7164
03:20:02.291 --> 03:20:03.460
<v Speaker 4>Like we all know it now.</v>

7165
03:20:03.490 --> 03:20:04.210
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

7166
03:20:04.210 --> 03:20:05.043
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

7167
03:20:05.800 --> 03:20:08.230
<v Speaker 4>All these little things in a lot of ways they add up.</v>

7168
03:20:08.560 --> 03:20:09.201
<v Speaker 4>You know every,</v>

7169
03:20:09.201 --> 03:20:10.660
<v Speaker 4>every little thing that happens.</v>

7170
03:20:10.661 --> 03:20:11.920
<v Speaker 4>It makes people talk about it.</v>

7171
03:20:11.921 --> 03:20:12.754
<v Speaker 4>It adds up.</v>

7172
03:20:12.880 --> 03:20:14.260
<v Speaker 4>We got a band together man.</v>

7173
03:20:14.261 --> 03:20:15.310
<v Speaker 4>Cause when you band together,</v>

7174
03:20:15.430 --> 03:20:16.690
<v Speaker 4>no one can be singled out.</v>

7175
03:20:17.050 --> 03:20:18.190
<v Speaker 4>We could take it all back.</v>

7176
03:20:18.340 --> 03:20:20.110
<v Speaker 4>We could do anything we fucking want to do.</v>

7177
03:20:20.111 --> 03:20:20.471
<v Speaker 4>We made,</v>

7178
03:20:20.471 --> 03:20:21.370
<v Speaker 4>we'd legal,</v>

7179
03:20:21.520 --> 03:20:22.061
<v Speaker 4>we made,</v>

7180
03:20:22.061 --> 03:20:23.080
<v Speaker 4>we'd legal.</v>

7181
03:20:23.470 --> 03:20:24.520
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking nuts.</v>

7182
03:20:24.610 --> 03:20:25.091
<v Speaker 4>And you know what?</v>

7183
03:20:25.091 --> 03:20:27.550
<v Speaker 4>The feds still scheduled one to know.</v>

7184
03:20:27.760 --> 03:20:28.750
<v Speaker 4>They fucking fine.</v>

7185
03:20:28.810 --> 03:20:30.040
<v Speaker 4>Still scheduled one.</v>

7186
03:20:30.280 --> 03:20:34.570
<v Speaker 4>But the people made that shit legal that the people have the fucking power man.</v>

7187
03:20:34.571 --> 03:20:35.404
<v Speaker 4>They do.</v>

7188
03:20:35.520 --> 03:20:36.353
<v Speaker 4>But they get,</v>

7189
03:20:36.390 --> 03:20:38.530
<v Speaker 4>that's the reason why they're making these fake videos.</v>

7190
03:20:38.650 --> 03:20:40.060
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think they're making these fake terrorist?</v>

7191
03:20:40.090 --> 03:20:40.440
<v Speaker 4>Because,</v>

7192
03:20:40.440 --> 03:20:41.920
<v Speaker 4>because they know what the bottom line,</v>

7193
03:20:42.190 --> 03:20:42.701
<v Speaker 4>bottom line,</v>

03:20:42.701 --> 03:20:43.780
<v Speaker 4>the people have the power.</v>

7195
03:20:43.870 --> 03:20:44.740
<v Speaker 4>So we got to make them,</v>

7196
03:20:44.800 --> 03:20:47.620
<v Speaker 4>we got to scare them because they have to go cam,</v>

7213
03:21:07.930 --> 03:21:09.760
<v Speaker 4>The John Stockwell man,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Just like in every organization.</v>

03:21:26.110 --> 03:21:27.490
<v Speaker 4>Just like in every agency,</v>

03:21:27.580 --> 03:21:28.900
<v Speaker 4>just like in every government,</v>

03:21:30.221 --> 03:21:31.810
<v Speaker 4>There's corruption and it isn't just here.</v>

7226
03:21:32.200 --> 03:21:33.033
<v Speaker 4>Every,</v>

7227
03:21:33.070 --> 03:21:37.390
<v Speaker 4>every goddamn government is the goal to create fear.</v>

<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

7229
03:21:38.140 --> 03:21:39.190
<v Speaker 4>that's part of it.</v>

7230
03:21:39.490 --> 03:21:40.810
<v Speaker 4>That's part of it of course,</v>

7231
03:21:40.870 --> 03:21:42.160
<v Speaker 4>because fears control.</v>

7232

03:21:42.940 --> 03:21:43.840
<v Speaker 4>That's part of control.</v>

03:21:46.280 --> 03:21:47.570
<v Speaker 11>energy control,</v>

7237
03:21:47.900 --> 03:21:48.770
<v Speaker 11>a lot of control,</v>

7238
03:21:48.771 --> 03:21:49.760
<v Speaker 11>water control,</v>

7239
03:21:49.880 --> 03:21:50.351
<v Speaker 11>control,</v>

7240
03:21:50.351 --> 03:21:51.184
<v Speaker 11>all that shit.</v>

7241
03:21:51.320 --> 03:21:55.580
<v Speaker 11>Agenda 21 look into agenda 21 it's that a conspiracy theory.</v>

7242
03:21:56.540 --> 03:21:59.870
<v Speaker 11>Agenda 21 is what we need to do to take this world.</v>

7243
03:22:00.170 --> 03:22:05.170
<v Speaker 11>The world leaders got together and this is like UN shit CFR shit.</v>

7244
03:22:05.870 --> 03:22:06.890
<v Speaker 11>They all got together.</v>

7245
03:22:07.280 --> 03:22:08.870
<v Speaker 11>Fuck countries and borders,</v>

7246
03:22:09.140 --> 03:22:10.400
<v Speaker 11>all the guys with all the money.</v>

7247
03:22:10.640 --> 03:22:12.070
<v Speaker 11>So what are we going to do it?</v>

7248
03:22:12.080 --> 03:22:15.170
<v Speaker 11>It'd be best if we just fucking control the shit and make it a one world</v>

7249
03:22:15.171 --> 03:22:16.670
<v Speaker 11>government and we control everything.</v>

7250
03:22:16.880 --> 03:22:18.320
<v Speaker 11>That's what we're in the middle of.</v>

7251
03:22:18.321 --> 03:22:22.670
<v Speaker 11>It's increments and people like just like they don't notice it's happening in</v>

7252
03:22:22.671 --> 03:22:23.504
<v Speaker 11>increments.</v>

7253
03:22:24.140 --> 03:22:25.400
<v Speaker 11>We can stop this shit.</v>

7254
03:22:25.610 --> 03:22:27.050
<v Speaker 11>We could stop this shit man.</v>

7255
03:22:27.350 --> 03:22:28.850
<v Speaker 11>We could turn this shit around.</v>

7256
03:22:29.040 --> 03:22:30.080
<v Speaker 11>We don't have to fucking just,</v>

7257
03:22:30.710 --> 03:22:32.530
<v Speaker 11>just sit there and watch it fucking happen.</v>

7258
03:22:32.960 --> 03:22:34.130
<v Speaker 11>Talk to watch it happen.</v>

7259
03:22:34.160 --> 03:22:34.993
<v Speaker 11>We can stop it.</v>

7260
03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:37.760
<v Speaker 11>I think what we talked about earlier that lard culture is kind of like a</v>

7261
03:22:37.761 --> 03:22:41.100
<v Speaker 11>battleship and a lot of words and then it's hard or</v>

7262
03:22:41.100 --> 03:22:43.100
<v Speaker 4>to make these big giant turns.</v>

7263
03:22:43.101 --> 03:22:43.551
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>

7264
03:22:43.551 --> 03:22:45.620
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't turn like a,</v>

7265
03:22:45.830 --> 03:22:48.500
<v Speaker 4>like a car getting educated and getting in line.</v>

7266
03:22:48.860 --> 03:22:50.600
<v Speaker 4>It takes a long time to like,</v>

7267
03:22:50.601 --> 03:22:51.500
<v Speaker 4>everybody has to realize,</v>

7268
03:22:51.501 --> 03:22:51.801
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

7269
03:22:51.801 --> 03:22:52.670
<v Speaker 4>we got to move this way.</v>

7270
03:22:52.690 --> 03:22:53.660
<v Speaker 4>Oh this is ridiculous.</v>

7271
03:22:54.080 --> 03:22:55.850
<v Speaker 4>I think this is what we're seeing in this election.</v>

7272
03:22:55.851 --> 03:23:00.470
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of the last one of these elections where we really interest</v>

7273
03:23:00.471 --> 03:23:02.090
<v Speaker 4>completely in a two party system.</v>

7274
03:23:02.390 --> 03:23:04.260
<v Speaker 4>I think we're like realizing it's ridiculous.</v>

7275
03:23:04.270 --> 03:23:05.740
<v Speaker 4>Especially when you watched the debates.</v>

7276
03:23:06.320 --> 03:23:08.120
<v Speaker 4>I've never been so into a presidential race.</v>

03:23:58.940 --> 03:24:01.310
<v Speaker 4>I wanted Trump to sound good.</v>

7303
03:24:01.490 --> 03:24:01.960
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

7304
03:24:01.960 --> 03:24:02.530

7307
03:24:04.221 --> 03:24:06.200
<v Speaker 4>And I had ended up turning the channel cause I'm like,</v>

7308
03:24:06.230 --> 03:24:06.981
<v Speaker 4>I was afraid of what?</v>

7309
03:24:06.981 --> 03:24:07.814
<v Speaker 4>He was angry.</v>

7310
03:24:08.020 --> 03:24:08.480
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

7311
03:24:08.480 --> 03:24:09.920
<v Speaker 4>If it's between Trump and Trump,</v>

7312
03:24:10.480 --> 03:24:12.520
<v Speaker 4>Trump Trump's full of shit too,</v>

7313
03:24:12.830 --> 03:24:13.311
<v Speaker 4>but damn,</v>

7314
03:24:13.311 --> 03:24:16.130
<v Speaker 4>I know Hillary is just in the fucking program.</v>

7315
03:24:16.340 --> 03:24:18.170
<v Speaker 4>They are the establishment.</v>

7316
03:24:18.290 --> 03:24:21.260
<v Speaker 4>Everybody wants Hillary because they know Hillary's president.</v>

7317
03:24:21.380 --> 03:24:21.621
<v Speaker 4>Ooh.</v>

7318
03:24:21.621 --> 03:24:26.621
<v Speaker 4>Everything goes full sail and demand and fucking business as mother fucking</v>

7319
03:24:27.021 --> 03:24:29.420
<v Speaker 4>usually if we get Hillary in there,</v>

7320
03:24:29.660 --> 03:24:30.830
<v Speaker 4>no kinks,</v>

7321
03:24:30.950 --> 03:24:32.370
<v Speaker 4>it's the same shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go.</v>

7324
03:24:35.360 --> 03:24:36.290
<v Speaker 4>But if you've got Trump,</v>

7325
03:24:36.560 --> 03:24:40.580
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like he's going to fuck shit up and then he's a man who knows people</v>

03:24:44.880 --> 03:24:45.090
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

7328
03:24:45.090 --> 03:24:46.560
<v Speaker 4>Could easily be a distraction,</v>

7329
03:24:47.460 --> 03:24:48.660
<v Speaker 4>might be in on it.</v>

7330
03:24:50.480 --> 03:24:53.250
<v Speaker 4>They're talking about on it.</v>

7331
03:24:53.730 --> 03:24:54.420
<v Speaker 4>Luck.</v>

7332
03:24:54.420 --> 03:24:59.420
<v Speaker 4>We're dealing with fucking like some Gotham city corruption type mindset and</v>

7333
03:25:00.151 --> 03:25:00.771
<v Speaker 4>Trump's base,</v>

7334
03:25:00.771 --> 03:25:01.604
<v Speaker 4>he could easily,</v>

7335
03:25:03.130 --> 03:25:04.770
<v Speaker 4>he might be part of it.</v>

7336
03:25:05.790 --> 03:25:06.750
<v Speaker 4>We need someone.</v>

7337

<v Speaker 5>Frank shamrock grabbed the rope.</v>

7443
03:28:30.340 --> 03:28:31.480
<v Speaker 5>He kept separating them.</v>

7444
03:28:32.170 --> 03:28:33.340
<v Speaker 5>And then finally at the end,</v>

7445
03:28:33.520 --> 03:28:37.180
<v Speaker 5>frank shamrock grabbed a toehold on island goals and fucking breaks his fucking</v>

7446
03:28:37.181 --> 03:28:38.014
<v Speaker 5>foot.</v>

7447
03:28:38.070 --> 03:28:39.250
<v Speaker 5>You got to watch that fight.</v>

7448
03:28:39.340 --> 03:28:40.620
<v Speaker 5>That's Kim.</v>

7449
03:28:40.670 --> 03:28:41.503
<v Speaker 5>I get question.</v>

7450
03:28:41.590 --> 03:28:43.120
<v Speaker 5>What's the most dangerous thing you've hunted?</v>

7451
03:28:43.490 --> 03:28:44.620
<v Speaker 5>Because I don't know shit about hunting.</v>

7452
03:28:44.770 --> 03:28:46.810
<v Speaker 5>And I remember you telling me about a guy who hunts,</v>

7453
03:28:47.230 --> 03:28:47.561
<v Speaker 5>I freak,</v>

7454
03:28:47.561 --> 03:28:47.951
<v Speaker 5>but he,</v>

7455
03:28:47.951 --> 03:28:50.060
<v Speaker 5>he'd like 100 buffalo and he would shoot them.</v>

7456
03:28:50.061 --> 03:28:50.231
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

7457
03:28:50.231 --> 03:28:50.951
<v Speaker 5>And then forgot clothes.</v>

7458
03:28:50.951 --> 03:28:51.191
<v Speaker 5>He would,</v>

7459
03:28:51.191 --> 03:28:52.810
<v Speaker 5>he would have to shoot him again cause they charge.</v>

7460
03:28:53.050 --> 03:28:53.591
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

7461
03:28:53.591 --> 03:28:54.900
<v Speaker 5>That was a show that I watched.</v>

7462
03:28:54.920 --> 03:28:56.350
<v Speaker 5>It was really kind of disturbing.</v>

7463
03:28:57.070 --> 03:28:58.360
<v Speaker 5>The guy shot an elephant.</v>

7464
03:28:58.480 --> 03:28:59.060
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

7465
03:28:59.060 --> 03:28:59.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

7466
03:28:59.340 --> 03:29:04.340
<v Speaker 5>And the elephant started running at him and then the guy with the a rifle shot</v>

7467
03:29:04.361 --> 03:29:06.430
<v Speaker 5>the elephant in the head and I was like,</v>

7468
03:29:06.431 --> 03:29:07.840
<v Speaker 5>what is going on here?</v>

7469
03:29:07.841 --> 03:29:08.270
<v Speaker 5>Like this?</v>

7470
03:29:08.270 --> 03:29:09.560
<v Speaker 5>It was gnarly on,</v>

7471
03:29:09.640 --> 03:29:10.710
<v Speaker 5>on some of those in,</v>

7472
03:29:10.750 --> 03:29:11.290
<v Speaker 5>in Africa.</v>

7473
03:29:11.290 --> 03:29:13.350
<v Speaker 5>And that dangerous game you don't want,</v>

7474
03:29:13.450 --> 03:29:15.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean you can't shoot when they're way out there because your,</v>

7475
03:29:15.550 --> 03:29:17.590
<v Speaker 5>your aim isn't going to be that accurate.</v>

7476
03:29:17.650 --> 03:29:20.440
<v Speaker 5>So you have to wait actually till they're right there til you know,</v>

7477
03:29:20.610 --> 03:29:21.610
<v Speaker 5>and we've got to get on.</v>

7478
03:29:21.660 --> 03:29:22.630
<v Speaker 5>They're kind of dangerous game.</v>

7479
03:29:22.631 --> 03:29:24.580
<v Speaker 5>We talked to their elephant,</v>

7480
03:29:24.670 --> 03:29:26.410
<v Speaker 5>a hippo.</v>

7481
03:29:26.710 --> 03:29:26.970
<v Speaker 5>Ooh.</v>

7482
03:29:26.970 --> 03:29:28.210
<v Speaker 5>Halos or buffalo.</v>

7483
03:29:28.570 --> 03:29:31.540
<v Speaker 5>That Cape Buffalo hunting is very crazy.</v>

7484
03:29:32.410 --> 03:29:33.610
<v Speaker 5>That's one of those things where you go,</v>

7485
03:29:33.730 --> 03:29:38.510
<v Speaker 5>we have these arbitrary rules as to what you can kill and what you can't kill</v>

7486
03:29:38.511 --> 03:29:38.631
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>

7487
03:29:38.631 --> 03:29:39.640
<v Speaker 5>It's a very strange,</v>

7488
03:29:39.730 --> 03:29:43.330
<v Speaker 5>but we all agree to them like we all agree it's okay to swat mosquitoes.</v>

7489
03:29:43.630 --> 03:29:45.550
<v Speaker 5>Nobody gets mad at you when you swap a mosquito.</v>

7490
03:29:45.580 --> 03:29:48.190
<v Speaker 5>Nobody gets mad at you when you swat a fly fly.</v>

7491
03:29:48.520 --> 03:29:49.930
<v Speaker 5>But he Kilifi nobody gives a shit.</v>

7492
03:29:49.931 --> 03:29:50.650
<v Speaker 5>You step on a roach.</v>

7493
03:29:50.650 --> 03:29:52.540
<v Speaker 5>Nobody gives a fuck about a roach.</v>

7494
03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:53.830
<v Speaker 5>But then you start moving up.</v>

7495
03:29:53.850 --> 03:29:55.150
<v Speaker 5>Just can you stop a mouse?</v>

7496
03:29:55.210 --> 03:29:55.810
<v Speaker 5>Definitely not.</v>

7497
03:29:55.810 --> 03:29:56.501
<v Speaker 5>Definitely not.</v>

7498
03:29:56.501 --> 03:29:57.410
<v Speaker 5>If you stomp them out,</v>

7499
03:29:57.411 --> 03:29:58.300
<v Speaker 5>so you're a piece of shit,</v>

7500
03:29:58.480 --> 03:30:00.940
<v Speaker 5>but if you put a mouse in a mouse trap,</v>

7501
03:30:01.120 --> 03:30:01.661
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

7502
03:30:01.661 --> 03:30:02.890
<v Speaker 5>you're not doing the dirty work.</v>

7503
03:30:03.040 --> 03:30:06.670
<v Speaker 5>You're farming it out to some fucking mercenary spring set up.</v>

7504
03:30:06.880 --> 03:30:07.240
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

7505
03:30:07.240 --> 03:30:07.421
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

7506
03:30:07.421 --> 03:30:08.254
<v Speaker 5>What about rats?</v>

7507
03:30:08.640 --> 03:30:10.030
<v Speaker 5>He can't stomp around either.</v>

7508
03:30:10.060 --> 03:30:10.630
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

7509
03:30:10.630 --> 03:30:11.010
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

7510
03:30:11.010 --> 03:30:11.350
<v Speaker 5>physical.</v>

7511
03:30:11.350 --> 03:30:12.220
<v Speaker 5>What about a beaver?</v>

7512
03:30:12.340 --> 03:30:12.521
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

7513
03:30:12.521 --> 03:30:13.900
<v Speaker 5>you can't kick a beaver to death.</v>

7514
03:30:13.930 --> 03:30:14.763
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

7515
03:30:15.430 --> 03:30:16.720
<v Speaker 5>I can't kick a baby to death.</v>

7516
03:30:16.750 --> 03:30:17.200
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

7517
03:30:17.200 --> 03:30:17.890
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

03:30:18.731 --> 03:30:19.511
<v Speaker 5>what level?</v>

7522
03:30:19.511 --> 03:30:20.560
<v Speaker 5>When do we decide this?</v>

7523
03:30:20.561 --> 03:30:20.711
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

7524
03:30:20.711 --> 03:30:25.060
<v Speaker 5>what weird distinction do we make about what life we can consume?</v>

7525
03:30:25.500 --> 03:30:26.260
<v Speaker 5>Societies.</v>

7526
03:30:26.260 --> 03:30:28.420
<v Speaker 5>Society's you decided it strange,</v>

7527
03:30:28.421 --> 03:30:28.750
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

7528
03:30:28.750 --> 03:30:31.420
<v Speaker 5>Cause it from movies cause we make them so friendly.</v>

7529
03:30:31.421 --> 03:30:31.931
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

7530
03:30:31.931 --> 03:30:32.451
<v Speaker 5>Like a raft.</v>

7531
03:30:32.451 --> 03:30:34.090
<v Speaker 5>It tooi Bambi.</v>

7532
03:30:34.091 --> 03:30:35.830
<v Speaker 5>You have all these animals for sure that I was,</v>

7533
03:30:35.831 --> 03:30:37.630
<v Speaker 5>bears are always friendly and movies.</v>

7534
03:30:37.750 --> 03:30:38.583
<v Speaker 5>Whole weeks,</v>

7535
03:30:39.050 --> 03:30:39.590
<v Speaker 5>cranes,</v>

7536
03:30:39.590 --> 03:30:41.790
<v Speaker 5>Jersey theory or my God,</v>

7537
03:30:44.080 --> 03:30:44.450
<v Speaker 5>Eddie.</v>

7538
03:30:44.450 --> 03:30:45.050
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>

7539
03:30:45.050 --> 03:30:47.120
<v Speaker 5>what if we were supposed to eat insects,</v>

7540
03:30:47.150 --> 03:30:49.580
<v Speaker 5>but we were brainwashed into thinking they were gross.</v>

7541
03:30:49.600 --> 03:30:49.720
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

7542
03:30:49.720 --> 03:30:50.360
<v Speaker 5>people use it.</v>

7543
03:30:50.360 --> 03:30:51.350
<v Speaker 5>We ate insects.</v>

7544
03:30:51.351 --> 03:30:53.090
<v Speaker 5>We wouldn't be on the tit.</v>

7545
03:30:53.240 --> 03:30:53.421
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

7546
03:30:53.421 --> 03:30:54.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's a conspiracy theory,</v>

7547
03:30:54.801 --> 03:30:57.290
<v Speaker 5>but it's definitely something that people are realizing,</v>

7548
03:30:57.291 --> 03:30:59.360
<v Speaker 5>especially with crickets and grasshoppers.</v>

7549
03:30:59.390 --> 03:31:02.490
<v Speaker 5>And they'll approach really healthy brought,</v>

7550
03:31:02.520 --> 03:31:03.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm scared to death of him.</v>

7551
03:31:03.891 --> 03:31:05.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm scared of that because of bugs.</v>

7552
03:31:05.601 --> 03:31:05.901
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

7553
03:31:05.901 --> 03:31:06.160
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

7554
03:31:06.160 --> 03:31:07.630
<v Speaker 5>like what if we're supposed to be like,</v>

7555
03:31:07.900 --> 03:31:09.200
<v Speaker 5>I know I do too as Lyme disease.</v>

7556
03:31:09.201 --> 03:31:10.034
<v Speaker 5>I was talking to this dude,</v>

7557
03:31:10.300 --> 03:31:11.750
<v Speaker 5>that kid that we were hanging out with.</v>

7558
03:31:11.780 --> 03:31:12.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

7559
03:31:12.380 --> 03:31:12.681
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

7560
03:31:12.681 --> 03:31:13.400
<v Speaker 5>He was uh,</v>

7561
03:31:13.400 --> 03:31:15.390
<v Speaker 5>talking about Lyme disease and uh,</v>

7562
03:31:15.500 --> 03:31:16.550
<v Speaker 5>he was saying that,</v>

7563
03:31:16.551 --> 03:31:16.671
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

7564
03:31:16.671 --> 03:31:18.980
<v Speaker 5>he got bit by a tick and I know,</v>

7565
03:31:19.160 --> 03:31:20.290
<v Speaker 5>I know three,</v>

7566
03:31:20.330 --> 03:31:24.830
<v Speaker 5>four people that have gotten Lyme disease from ticks and you get bit by these</v>

7567
03:31:24.831 --> 03:31:26.960
<v Speaker 5>fucking ticks and it fucks with your immune system.</v>

7568
03:31:27.140 --> 03:31:28.310
<v Speaker 5>That's the only way to get it.</v>

7569
03:31:28.440 --> 03:31:29.930
<v Speaker 5>Or you're pretty sure that it is the only</v>

7570
03:31:31.440 --> 03:31:35.690
<v Speaker 5>tax because people are scared of the Times because bugs transmit horrible</v>

7571
03:31:35.691 --> 03:31:36.231
<v Speaker 5>diseases.</v>

7572
03:31:36.231 --> 03:31:37.130
<v Speaker 5>It ruined your life.</v>

7573
03:31:37.400 --> 03:31:40.370
<v Speaker 5>Like ticks in particular transmit horrible diseases.</v>

7574
03:31:40.371 --> 03:31:43.760
<v Speaker 5>If you thought the black plague was from rats wasn't really from rats,</v>

7575
03:31:43.970 --> 03:31:45.920
<v Speaker 5>it was from what the rats were carrying them there,</v>

7576
03:31:45.921 --> 03:31:49.370
<v Speaker 5>they were carrying some sort of Mites or bacteria or some,</v>

7577
03:31:49.371 --> 03:31:50.630
<v Speaker 5>some bugs or some shit.</v>

7578
03:31:50.810 --> 03:31:53.000
<v Speaker 5>Like what was the black plague that it came,</v>

7579
03:31:53.180 --> 03:31:54.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure this,</v>

7580
03:31:54.530 --> 03:31:57.470
<v Speaker 5>that it came off of things that lived on the rats.</v>

7581
03:31:57.500 --> 03:31:58.900
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't necessarily the rats itself.</v>

7582
03:31:58.950 --> 03:32:02.450
<v Speaker 5>Also insects kill more humans than any other animal in the world does he know</v>

7583
03:32:02.451 --> 03:32:03.950
<v Speaker 5>black widows are like Viagara.</v>

7584
03:32:04.940 --> 03:32:05.773
<v Speaker 5>Here it is.</v>

7585
03:32:05.810 --> 03:32:10.130
<v Speaker 5>The black plague barber caused by bacterium.</v>

7586
03:32:10.190 --> 03:32:10.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

7587
03:32:10.940 --> 03:32:11.631
<v Speaker 5>pesticides.</v>

7588
03:32:11.631 --> 03:32:14.000
<v Speaker 5>This circulates amongst the wild rodents.</v>

7589
03:32:14.090 --> 03:32:14.380
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

7590
03:32:14.380 --> 03:32:15.260
<v Speaker 5>so that was a,</v>

7591
03:32:15.530 --> 03:32:16.820
<v Speaker 5>it was a bacteria.</v>

7592
03:32:17.050 --> 03:32:20.690
<v Speaker 5>It was some sort of a disease that lived off the rodents as a bug.</v>

7593
03:32:20.990 --> 03:32:21.950
<v Speaker 5>It's a fucking bug.</v>

7594
03:32:21.970 --> 03:32:22.970
<v Speaker 5>Cause a million bugs.</v>

7595
03:32:22.971 --> 03:32:24.920
<v Speaker 5>They could just think about,</v>

7596
03:32:24.921 --> 03:32:27.290
<v Speaker 5>have you ever tried to just grab a grasshopper?</v>

7597
03:32:27.740 --> 03:32:28.730
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

7598
03:32:28.731 --> 03:32:29.564
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

7599
03:32:29.940 --> 03:32:30.840
<v Speaker 5>Tries to jump in.</v>

7600
03:32:30.841 --> 03:32:31.700
<v Speaker 5>You want to let it go.</v>

7601
03:32:31.701 --> 03:32:35.120
<v Speaker 5>And it's like the guy's scary at generation after generation.</v>

7602
03:32:35.270 --> 03:32:37.600
<v Speaker 5>What if we were like fucking really good at insects?</v>

7603
03:32:37.660 --> 03:32:38.500
<v Speaker 5>What we used to be,</v>

7604
03:32:38.501 --> 03:32:38.840
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

7605
03:32:38.840 --> 03:32:39.051
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

7606
03:32:39.051 --> 03:32:43.520
<v Speaker 5>if you ever talked to anybody who is like a bug catcher or a moth catcher or</v>

7607
03:32:43.700 --> 03:32:45.110
<v Speaker 5>somebody collects butterflies,</v>

7608
03:32:45.530 --> 03:32:50.450
<v Speaker 5>they say that there's a thrill that people get when you catch up of rare bug and</v>

7609
03:32:50.451 --> 03:32:51.500
<v Speaker 5>you cash in your neck.</v>

7610
03:32:51.650 --> 03:32:54.830
<v Speaker 5>That goes DNA deep because at one point in time,</v>

7611
03:32:54.980 --> 03:32:55.721
<v Speaker 5>humans are,</v>

7612
03:32:55.721 --> 03:32:56.301
<v Speaker 5>our answers.</v>

03:32:56.301 --> 03:32:57.770
<v Speaker 5>Did you used to be insectivores.</v>

7614
03:32:58.070 --> 03:32:58.560
<v Speaker 5>So the,</v>

7615
03:32:58.560 --> 03:33:00.200
<v Speaker 5>the people that are like bug catchers,</v>

7619
03:33:06.270 --> 03:33:10.160
<v Speaker 5>it's a life form that you're allowed to capture because they only live like a</v>

7620
03:33:10.161 --> 03:33:11.060
<v Speaker 5>week anyway.</v>

7621
03:33:11.510 --> 03:33:12.680
<v Speaker 5>And so you're allowed to have these,</v>

7622
03:33:12.681 --> 03:33:14.930
<v Speaker 5>you're a trophy hunter for butterflies.</v>

7623
03:33:15.230 --> 03:33:15.890
<v Speaker 5>You're allowed to be,</v>

7624
03:33:15.890 --> 03:33:16.670
<v Speaker 5>but you're like,</v>

7625
03:33:16.670 --> 03:33:17.760
<v Speaker 5>you're a person who's an,</v>

7626
03:33:17.910 --> 03:33:18.320

7749
03:36:21.210 --> 03:36:23.040
<v Speaker 12>the poachers over there is like,</v>

7750
03:36:23.370 --> 03:36:23.970
<v Speaker 12>when you,</v>

7751
03:36:23.970 --> 03:36:25.920
<v Speaker 12>when you would see a poach or with a gun,</v>

7752
03:36:26.070 --> 03:36:28.440
<v Speaker 12>it was almost like whoever could shoot first.</v>

7753
03:36:28.890 --> 03:36:30.090
<v Speaker 12>They wanted to shoot at you.</v>

7754
03:36:31.110 --> 03:36:33.090
<v Speaker 12>We had a man who wanted a shooter.</v>

7755
03:36:33.100 --> 03:36:33.840
<v Speaker 12>You Poach.</v>

7756
03:36:33.840 --> 03:36:34.673
<v Speaker 12>Poach roasters.</v>

7757
03:36:35.020 --> 03:36:35.510

<v Speaker 12>they're getting caught.</v>

7761
03:36:38.981 --> 03:36:39.814
<v Speaker 12>Poaching.</v>

7762
03:36:40.810 --> 03:36:41.380
<v Speaker 12>Right.</v>

7763
03:36:41.380 --> 03:36:43.150
<v Speaker 12>And so it's almost like the wild west.</v>

7764
03:36:43.180 --> 03:36:44.060
<v Speaker 12>God Damn.</v>

7765
03:36:44.110 --> 03:36:44.450
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

7766
03:36:44.450 --> 03:36:46.450
<v Speaker 12>And all they're trying to get his meat.</v>

7767
03:36:46.630 --> 03:36:47.463
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>

7768
03:36:47.600 --> 03:36:48.130
<v Speaker 12>And say,</v>

7769
03:36:48.130 --> 03:36:48.461
<v Speaker 12>okay,</v>

7770
03:36:48.461 --> 03:36:48.850
<v Speaker 12>meet,</v>

7771
03:36:48.850 --> 03:36:49.683
<v Speaker 12>meet good.</v>

7772
03:36:49.780 --> 03:36:50.830
<v Speaker 12>They want protein.</v>

7773
03:36:51.100 --> 03:36:52.150
<v Speaker 12>So they would go,</v>

7774
03:36:52.151 --> 03:36:53.170
<v Speaker 12>they'd go into land.</v>

7775
03:36:53.171 --> 03:36:54.250
<v Speaker 12>They're not supposed to be on.</v>

7776
03:36:54.370 --> 03:36:55.420
<v Speaker 12>How do they know you're cool?</v>

7777
03:36:55.421 --> 03:36:56.590
<v Speaker 12>What does that process like?</v>

7778
03:36:56.620 --> 03:36:56.770
<v Speaker 12>They,</v>

7779
03:36:56.770 --> 03:36:57.130
<v Speaker 12>they,</v>

7780
03:36:57.130 --> 03:36:58.870
<v Speaker 12>they don't go like this.</v>

7781
03:36:58.871 --> 03:36:59.470
<v Speaker 12>Right?</v>

7782
03:36:59.470 --> 03:37:00.190
<v Speaker 12>You go like this.</v>

7783
03:37:00.190 --> 03:37:01.000
<v Speaker 12>No,</v>

7784
03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:01.900
<v Speaker 12>you don't do this.</v>

7785
03:37:01.930 --> 03:37:02.201
<v Speaker 12>No,</v>

7786
03:37:02.201 --> 03:37:03.610
<v Speaker 12>because they point the gun at you.</v>

7787
03:37:03.611 --> 03:37:04.780
<v Speaker 12>They're not supposed to be there.</v>

7788
03:37:05.440 --> 03:37:06.460
<v Speaker 12>So Walter Poachers,</v>

7789
03:37:06.461 --> 03:37:07.570
<v Speaker 12>is that what happens then?</v>

7790
03:37:07.571 --> 03:37:08.530
<v Speaker 12>What's the situation?</v>

7791
03:37:08.950 --> 03:37:10.910
<v Speaker 12>The point a gun at them and are</v>

7792
03:37:12.640 --> 03:37:14.740
<v Speaker 12>the first experience that we had is,</v>

7793
03:37:14.741 --> 03:37:15.574
<v Speaker 12>I saw this,</v>

7794
03:37:15.640 --> 03:37:16.301
<v Speaker 12>this guy,</v>

7795
03:37:16.301 --> 03:37:17.200
<v Speaker 12>he was crossed,</v>

7796
03:37:17.260 --> 03:37:17.600
<v Speaker 12>I don't know,</v>

7797
03:37:17.600 --> 03:37:19.450
<v Speaker 12>150 yards away and I,</v>

7798
03:37:19.460 --> 03:37:21.490
<v Speaker 12>the guy I was with is who I was hunting with.</v>

7799
03:37:21.491 --> 03:37:22.324
<v Speaker 12>His name was Ryan.</v>

7800
03:37:22.600 --> 03:37:23.170
<v Speaker 12>And I said,</v>

7801
03:37:23.170 --> 03:37:24.010
<v Speaker 12>I see a man.</v>

7802
03:37:24.490 --> 03:37:24.821
<v Speaker 12>And he goes,</v>

7803
03:37:24.821 --> 03:37:25.151
<v Speaker 12>where?</v>

7804
03:37:25.151 --> 03:37:25.690
<v Speaker 12>I said,</v>

7805
03:37:25.690 --> 03:37:27.220
<v Speaker 12>there's a man right there,</v>

7806
03:37:27.280 --> 03:37:27.490
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

7807
03:37:27.490 --> 03:37:28.210
<v Speaker 12>it was a black guy.</v>

7808
03:37:28.210 --> 03:37:31.390
<v Speaker 12>He had all all brown stuff on racist.</v>

7809
03:37:31.420 --> 03:37:32.080
<v Speaker 12>And uh,</v>

7810
03:37:32.080 --> 03:37:32.913
<v Speaker 12>I said,</v>

7811
03:37:33.100 --> 03:37:33.431
<v Speaker 12>I go,</v>

7812
03:37:33.431 --> 03:37:35.470
<v Speaker 12>he's got a gun and he goes,</v>

7813
03:37:35.950 --> 03:37:37.000
<v Speaker 12>get behind this tree.</v>

7814
03:37:37.300 --> 03:37:37.691
<v Speaker 12>And I said,</v>

7815
03:37:37.691 --> 03:37:38.560
<v Speaker 12>are we going to get shot?</v>

7816
03:37:38.920 --> 03:37:40.420
<v Speaker 12>And he goes to stay behind the tree.</v>

7817
03:37:41.020 --> 03:37:44.170
<v Speaker 12>And so the guy circled around and came,</v>

7818
03:37:44.260 --> 03:37:47.640
<v Speaker 12>he was 150 yards away then and he came to 50 yards and you standing there</v>

7819
03:37:47.690 --> 03:37:50.590
<v Speaker 12>staring with his gun and uh,</v>

7820
03:37:50.650 --> 03:37:51.670
<v Speaker 12>he said he's a poacher.</v>

7821
03:37:52.030 --> 03:37:53.940
<v Speaker 12>The guys were said he's a poacher.</v>

7822
03:37:53.950 --> 03:37:54.850
<v Speaker 12>This guy never talked.</v>

7823
03:37:55.390 --> 03:37:58.180
<v Speaker 12>Finally he melted back into the trees and I was standing there and I said,</v>

7824
03:37:58.181 --> 03:38:00.010
<v Speaker 12>I see two more guys up in the rocks.</v>

7825
03:38:00.520 --> 03:38:02.470
<v Speaker 12>And they were hiding in the rocks and they took off running.</v>

7826
03:38:02.860 --> 03:38:06.370
<v Speaker 12>So I went up to their camp and they had all this,</v>

7827
03:38:06.371 --> 03:38:06.670
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

7828
03:38:06.670 --> 03:38:06.911
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

7829
03:38:06.911 --> 03:38:08.210
<v Speaker 12>the witch doctor had told him,</v>

7830
03:38:08.211 --> 03:38:09.700
<v Speaker 12>if you put powder on your wrist,</v>

7831
03:38:09.701 --> 03:38:10.630
<v Speaker 12>you're going to be invisible.</v>

7832
03:38:10.630 --> 03:38:14.020
<v Speaker 12>So that guy probably thought he was invisible because the witch doctor of the</v>

7833
03:38:14.021 --> 03:38:17.410
<v Speaker 12>village told him you went to their camp,</v>

7834
03:38:17.440 --> 03:38:20.110
<v Speaker 12>you didn't go back to your goddamn car and take the fuck off.</v>

7835
03:38:20.330 --> 03:38:20.980
<v Speaker 12>No,</v>

7836
03:38:20.980 --> 03:38:22.540
<v Speaker 12>just camp to the camp.</v>

7837
03:38:22.541 --> 03:38:23.650
<v Speaker 12>And I got hold their stuff.</v>

7838
03:38:24.010 --> 03:38:28.780
<v Speaker 12>And the reason why he didn't shoot it 150 yards is because they don't have any</v>

7839
03:38:28.781 --> 03:38:29.141
<v Speaker 12>ammo.</v>

7840
03:38:29.141 --> 03:38:30.250
<v Speaker 12>So they have a rifle,</v>

7841
03:38:30.340 --> 03:38:31.173
<v Speaker 12>but they have to,</v>

7842
03:38:31.210 --> 03:38:33.310
<v Speaker 12>they have to make it into a firearm essentially.</v>

7843
03:38:33.311 --> 03:38:35.410
<v Speaker 12>So they have to stuff ball bearings down there,</v>

7844
03:38:35.411 --> 03:38:37.030
<v Speaker 12>old school firing,</v>

7845
03:38:37.031 --> 03:38:37.510
<v Speaker 12>Pin,</v>

7846
03:38:37.510 --> 03:38:39.220
<v Speaker 12>the civil war and you're fucking right.</v>

7847
03:38:39.221 --> 03:38:39.980
<v Speaker 12>Gum powers,</v>

7848
03:38:39.980 --> 03:38:42.640
<v Speaker 12>they have to be safe 40 yards away.</v>

7849
03:38:43.060 --> 03:38:47.590
<v Speaker 12>And he was got that close and saw the Guy Ryan who I was with had a high power</v>

7850
03:38:47.830 --> 03:38:49.360
<v Speaker 12>rifle with a scope and he's like,</v>

7851
03:38:49.361 --> 03:38:52.000
<v Speaker 12>well I'm out gunned here is what he is thinking,</v>

7852
03:38:52.001 --> 03:38:52.480
<v Speaker 12>I'm assuming.</v>

7853
03:38:52.480 --> 03:38:53.171
<v Speaker 12>And he took off.</v>

7854
03:38:53.171 --> 03:38:54.910
<v Speaker 12>Then the guys he's with took off and all,</v>

7855
03:38:54.911 --> 03:38:59.440
<v Speaker 12>they had the head of burlap sacks with wire harnesses to put over there like a</v>

7856
03:38:59.441 --> 03:39:01.810
<v Speaker 12>backstrap in a burlap sack.</v>

7857
03:39:01.870 --> 03:39:02.230
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>

7858
03:39:02.230 --> 03:39:03.640
<v Speaker 12>the burlap sack races.</v>

7859
03:39:04.510 --> 03:39:04.781
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>

7860
03:39:04.781 --> 03:39:05.351
<v Speaker 12>exactly.</v>

7861
03:39:05.351 --> 03:39:06.700
<v Speaker 12>And so they would kill an animal.</v>

7862
03:39:06.701 --> 03:39:07.534
<v Speaker 12>They'd poach it,</v>

7863
03:39:07.720 --> 03:39:09.130
<v Speaker 12>they'd cut the meat off,</v>

7864
03:39:09.131 --> 03:39:12.130
<v Speaker 12>they'd hang it on branches or rope and dry it out,</v>

7865
03:39:12.340 --> 03:39:14.120
<v Speaker 12>and then they'd take that meat.</v>

7866
03:39:14.520 --> 03:39:16.150
<v Speaker 12>They just called protein in a,</v>

7867
03:39:16.230 --> 03:39:16.990
<v Speaker 12>put it in the borough,</v>

7868
03:39:16.990 --> 03:39:17.741
<v Speaker 12>burlap sack,</v>

7869
03:39:17.741 --> 03:39:20.020
<v Speaker 12>take hike all the way back to the village and sell it.</v>

7870
03:39:20.490 --> 03:39:21.810
<v Speaker 12>And what do they leave the,</v>

7871
03:39:22.120 --> 03:39:23.140
<v Speaker 12>the head and everything?</v>

7872
03:39:23.170 --> 03:39:23.411
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>

7873
03:39:23.411 --> 03:39:24.101
<v Speaker 12>just bones.</v>

7874
03:39:24.101 --> 03:39:24.940
<v Speaker 12>You know what you can't eat.</v>

7875
03:39:25.120 --> 03:39:25.840
<v Speaker 12>So anyway,</v>

7876
03:39:25.840 --> 03:39:28.330
<v Speaker 12>that's when you talk about killing animals,</v>

7877
03:39:28.331 --> 03:39:30.610
<v Speaker 12>they will gladly take the animals you kill.</v>

7878
03:39:31.150 --> 03:39:31.983
<v Speaker 12>You know what I mean?</v>

7879
03:39:32.080 --> 03:39:33.830
<v Speaker 12>And as far as for hunting goes,</v>

7880
03:39:33.831 --> 03:39:34.131
<v Speaker 12>you say,</v>

7881
03:39:34.131 --> 03:39:35.220
<v Speaker 12>well why would you want to go?</v>

7882
03:39:35.280 --> 03:39:36.480
<v Speaker 12>I mentioned why I would go,</v>

7883
03:39:36.700 --> 03:39:39.460
<v Speaker 4>but it also is the only economy they have over there.</v>

7884
03:39:39.820 --> 03:39:41.140
<v Speaker 4>You know in Tanzania,</v>

7885
03:39:42.120 --> 03:39:43.360
<v Speaker 4>one monkey meetings,</v>

7886
03:39:43.361 --> 03:39:44.194
<v Speaker 4>they will need that.</v>

7887
03:39:44.370 --> 03:39:44.740
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

7888
03:39:44.740 --> 03:39:45.573
<v Speaker 4>some of them do.</v>

7889
03:39:45.580 --> 03:39:47.650
<v Speaker 4>You said this is the only reason you said is the,</v>

7890
03:39:48.130 --> 03:39:50.220
<v Speaker 4>is the only economy they have out hunting,</v>

7891
03:39:50.221 --> 03:39:50.560
<v Speaker 4>hunting,</v>

7892
03:39:50.560 --> 03:39:51.670
<v Speaker 4>hunting trophies.</v>

7893
03:39:53.040 --> 03:39:53.620
<v Speaker 4>People.</v>

7894
03:39:53.620 --> 03:39:54.620
<v Speaker 4>People would call it trophy,</v>

7895
03:39:55.310 --> 03:39:55.890
<v Speaker 4>but it's just,</v>

7896
03:39:55.890 --> 03:39:58.490
<v Speaker 4>it's just hunters from abroad going there and,</v>

7897
03:39:58.570 --> 03:40:01.800
<v Speaker 4>and putting money in the economy challenge.</v>

7898
03:40:02.170 --> 03:40:03.003
<v Speaker 4>Is that why you go with it?</v>

7899
03:40:03.010 --> 03:40:04.150
<v Speaker 4>Cause it's the ultimate challenge.</v>

7900
03:40:04.260 --> 03:40:04.591
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

7901
03:40:04.591 --> 03:40:04.951
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>

7902
03:40:04.951 --> 03:40:05.221
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

7903
03:40:05.221 --> 03:40:10.221
<v Speaker 12>to kill a Cape Buffalo with a bow and Arrow tato tough.</v>

7904
03:40:11.010 --> 03:40:12.360
<v Speaker 12>Those they call them black death.</v>

7905
03:40:12.570 --> 03:40:14.040
<v Speaker 12>Why they kill people.</v>

7906
03:40:14.070 --> 03:40:14.700
<v Speaker 12>Damn.</v>

7907
03:40:14.700 --> 03:40:15.060
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>

7908
03:40:15.060 --> 03:40:15.893
<v Speaker 12>they're nasty.</v>

7909
03:40:16.040 --> 03:40:17.010
<v Speaker 4>So you are you,</v>

7910
03:40:17.011 --> 03:40:18.830
<v Speaker 4>you know hunters that have died?</v>

7911
03:40:19.650 --> 03:40:20.350
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>

7912
03:40:20.350 --> 03:40:21.910
<v Speaker 12>I don't know personally any,</v>

<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

7925
03:40:40.631 --> 03:40:41.890
<v Speaker 12>when I talk about the challenge,</v>

7926
03:40:41.910 --> 03:40:43.090
<v Speaker 12>that's why we do it.</v>

7927
03:40:43.091 --> 03:40:46.850
<v Speaker 12>We get up in the cliffs are those sheep lives and live and he's with the bone</v>

7928
03:40:46.870 --> 03:40:50.380
<v Speaker 12>Arrow and one false step up there.</v>

7929
03:40:50.381 --> 03:40:51.730
<v Speaker 12>And that could be your last,</v>

7930
03:40:51.731 --> 03:40:53.720
<v Speaker 12>and that's what happened to him a year ago.</v>

7931
03:40:53.721 --> 03:40:54.190
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>

7932
03:40:54.190 --> 03:40:55.060
<v Speaker 12>October 4th.</v>

7933
03:40:55.180 --> 03:40:55.601
<v Speaker 12>Damn.</v>

7934
03:40:55.601 --> 03:40:56.470
<v Speaker 12>That sucks man.</v>

7935
03:40:56.770 --> 03:40:57.041
<v Speaker 12>So,</v>

7936
03:40:57.041 --> 03:40:57.790
<v Speaker 12>but that's,</v>

7937
03:40:57.790 --> 03:40:58.091
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

7938
03:40:58.091 --> 03:40:59.080
<v Speaker 12>when we talk about,</v>

7939
03:40:59.170 --> 03:40:59.441
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

7940
03:40:59.441 --> 03:41:00.640
<v Speaker 12>you want to hunt black death,</v>

7941
03:41:00.641 --> 03:41:03.460
<v Speaker 12>you want to hunt a sheep in the mountains,</v>

7942
03:41:03.700 --> 03:41:06.160
<v Speaker 12>there's an inherit risk in doing that.</v>

7943
03:41:06.510 --> 03:41:07.510
<v Speaker 12>We understand that.</v>

7944
03:41:07.750 --> 03:41:08.590
<v Speaker 12>And that's part of,</v>

7945
03:41:08.650 --> 03:41:09.700
<v Speaker 12>that's part of the journey.</v>

7946
03:41:09.730 --> 03:41:09.851
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>

7947
03:41:09.851 --> 03:41:10.600
<v Speaker 12>that makes sense.</v>

7948
03:41:10.600 --> 03:41:11.433
<v Speaker 12>So</v>

7949
03:41:12.910 --> 03:41:13.121
<v Speaker 12>it's,</v>

7950
03:41:13.121 --> 03:41:15.970
<v Speaker 12>so it's a weird thing</v>

7951
03:41:16.070 --> 03:41:21.070
<v Speaker 4>to be a person aware of all the things that you need to consume to stay alive,</v>

03:42:51.390 --> 03:42:52.530
<v Speaker 12>So then my buddy Roy,</v>

8017
03:42:52.531 --> 03:42:53.364

8020
03:42:54.061 --> 03:42:54.331
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

8021
03:42:54.331 --> 03:42:56.640
<v Speaker 12>introduced me to bow hunting when I was 18,</v>

8022
03:42:56.910 --> 03:42:58.380
<v Speaker 12>and then that's all I've done since then.</v>

8023
03:42:59.190 --> 03:42:59.931
<v Speaker 12>Do you feel the rush,</v>

8024
03:42:59.931 --> 03:43:00.764
<v Speaker 12>is that like,</v>

8025

<v Speaker 12>no matter what the fuck goes down,</v>

8026
03:43:03.090 --> 03:43:04.170
<v Speaker 12>you're going to be able to eat?</v>

8027
03:43:05.070 --> 03:43:05.461
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 12>no rush right now.</v>

8029
03:43:06.650 --> 03:43:07.483
<v Speaker 12>Hunting,</v>

8030
03:43:07.610 --> 03:43:11.610
<v Speaker 12>hunting has given me confidence in all aspects of life because I've overcome so</v>

8031
03:43:11.611 --> 03:43:12.690
<v Speaker 12>much out.</v>

8032
03:43:12.740 --> 03:43:13.980
<v Speaker 12>You know in the mountains,</v>

8033
03:43:14.000 --> 03:43:16.630
<v Speaker 12>you know that you guys can go out and shit went down.</v>

8034
03:43:16.650 --> 03:43:18.780
<v Speaker 12>You went out to some stream and Colorado,</v>

8035
03:43:19.110 --> 03:43:20.160
<v Speaker 12>you're going to find a fine,</v>

8036
03:43:20.500 --> 03:43:20.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8037
03:43:20.940 --> 03:43:21.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8038
03:43:21.271 --> 03:43:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Most likely I trust you.</v>

8039
03:43:22.921 --> 03:43:24.840
<v Speaker 1>So is the right by your side in a day.</v>

8040
03:43:24.870 --> 03:43:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Here's the reality of a day.</v>

8041
03:43:26.731 --> 03:43:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Like today it's 86 degrees.</v>

8042
03:43:29.610 --> 03:43:31.140
<v Speaker 1>If there's nothing going on,</v>

8043
03:43:31.170 --> 03:43:32.820
<v Speaker 1>if we don't have any refrigeration,</v>

8044
03:43:33.240 --> 03:43:36.450
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of fucked because food's not going to last.</v>

8045
03:43:36.570 --> 03:43:38.290
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to have to get it on a regular basis.</v>

8046
03:43:38.291 --> 03:43:39.630
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to dry shit out.</v>

8047
03:43:39.660 --> 03:43:43.200
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to have vegetables like the African as in Tanzania or just</v>

8048
03:43:43.201 --> 03:43:45.270
<v Speaker 1>slap me down just like the settlers did.</v>

8049
03:43:45.320 --> 03:43:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I think I first came here and I tried to,</v>

8050
03:43:47.910 --> 03:43:48.271
<v Speaker 1>well they,</v>

8051
03:43:48.271 --> 03:43:48.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8052
03:43:48.481 --> 03:43:51.210
<v Speaker 1>they decimated the animal populations across the country.</v>

8053
03:43:51.480 --> 03:43:55.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading that Dan Flores book about wolves or coyotes.</v>

8054
03:43:56.070 --> 03:43:56.903
<v Speaker 1>Coyotes,</v>

8055
03:43:57.190 --> 03:43:58.023

<v Speaker 1>It's fucking incredible.</v>

8058
03:44:00.270 --> 03:44:01.200
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

8059
03:44:01.320 --> 03:44:01.781

03:44:02.261 --> 03:44:02.500
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

8063
03:44:02.500 --> 03:44:02.761

<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

8067
03:44:06.721 --> 03:44:10.980
<v Speaker 1>what they did to all the animals across the United States after the war.</v>

8068
03:44:11.120 --> 03:44:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8069
03:44:11.350 --> 03:44:13.290
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people fucking watch war.</v>

8070
03:44:13.291 --> 03:44:14.100

<v Speaker 1>American war?</v>

8072
03:44:14.821 --> 03:44:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Which war was it?</v>

8073
03:44:15.610 --> 03:44:16.141
<v Speaker 1>It should have been,</v>

8074
03:44:16.141 --> 03:44:16.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

8075
03:44:16.410 --> 03:44:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Spanish American war post that the soldiers came back and they needed a way to</v>

8076
03:44:20.881 --> 03:44:21.511
<v Speaker 1>make a living.</v>

8077
03:44:21.511 --> 03:44:24.630
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things they did is they did what they called market hunting,</v>

8078
03:44:25.320 --> 03:44:26.700
<v Speaker 1>did grow across the country,</v>

8079
03:44:26.730 --> 03:44:30.870
<v Speaker 1>just shooting shit for stores and they had a shoot shit all the time for what</v>

<v Speaker 1>for sell,</v>

8083
03:44:33.230 --> 03:44:34.590
<v Speaker 1>for to sell them for me,</v>

8084
03:44:34.950 --> 03:44:35.490
<v Speaker 1>like with,</v>

8085
03:44:35.490 --> 03:44:37.500
<v Speaker 1>people had domesticated some animals,</v>

8086
03:44:37.501 --> 03:44:40.890
<v Speaker 1>but there was also a lot of money and just shooting animals and getting to meet</v>

8087
03:44:40.891 --> 03:44:42.480
<v Speaker 1>out about where'd you get this information from?</v>

8088
03:44:42.481 --> 03:44:44.580
<v Speaker 1>The library to this is all,</v>

8089
03:44:44.640 --> 03:44:49.160
<v Speaker 1>this is all from Dan [inaudible] book and also he's a,</v>

8090
03:44:49.200 --> 03:44:50.250
<v Speaker 1>he's a professor?</v>

8091
03:44:50.400 --> 03:44:50.641
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

8092
03:44:50.641 --> 03:44:50.821
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

8093
03:44:50.821 --> 03:44:51.001
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

8094
03:44:51.001 --> 03:44:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Dan Flores is a professor and he used to be,</v>

8095
03:44:54.061 --> 03:44:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Steve Rinella is a professor and he was in some sort of a,</v>

8096
03:44:59.041 --> 03:45:00.630
<v Speaker 1>a natural history.</v>

8097
03:45:00.750 --> 03:45:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8098
03:45:02.070 --> 03:45:02.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8099
03:45:02.580 --> 03:45:03.001
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>

8100
03:45:03.001 --> 03:45:04.050
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was.</v>

8101
03:45:04.410 --> 03:45:04.711
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

8102
03:45:04.711 --> 03:45:09.060
<v Speaker 1>he's like a wildlife historian so he understands like the history of wildlife in</v>

8103
03:45:09.061 --> 03:45:12.990
<v Speaker 1>this country and he's like up to the latest information as far as like what</v>

8104
03:45:12.991 --> 03:45:15.420
<v Speaker 1>animals evolved here and where they spread out,</v>

8105
03:45:15.421 --> 03:45:16.380
<v Speaker 1>where they came back.</v>

8106
03:45:16.860 --> 03:45:18.690
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating shit.</v>

8107
03:45:18.900 --> 03:45:19.641
<v Speaker 1>So he was on Rinella,</v>

8108
03:45:19.641 --> 03:45:23.250
<v Speaker 1>his podcasts and he was talking about how they just went across the country just</v>

8109
03:45:23.251 --> 03:45:24.570
<v Speaker 1>wiping out antelope,</v>

8110
03:45:24.600 --> 03:45:25.620
<v Speaker 1>just wiping them out,</v>

8111
03:45:25.840 --> 03:45:27.150
<v Speaker 1>just wiping out buffalo,</v>

8112
03:45:27.151 --> 03:45:30.160
<v Speaker 1>wiping them out and they just take that and sell it to market</v>

8113
03:45:30.160 --> 03:45:33.370
<v Speaker 4>and they just wasn't part of it is because it,</v>

8114
03:45:33.450 --> 03:45:36.190
<v Speaker 4>it had to be fresh all the time basically because we could keep it,</v>

8115
03:45:36.430 --> 03:45:36.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

8116
03:45:36.641 --> 03:45:40.150
<v Speaker 4>it's no different than a mountain lion killing every three days.</v>

8117
03:45:40.430 --> 03:45:41.710
<v Speaker 4>They like to eat fresh meat.</v>

8118
03:45:41.770 --> 03:45:42.610
<v Speaker 4>In their defense.</v>

8119
03:45:42.611 --> 03:45:44.840
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know they were going to kill all the God damn man was,</v>

8120
03:45:44.841 --> 03:45:46.240
<v Speaker 4>I probably thought it was going to last forever.</v>

8121
03:45:46.260 --> 03:45:48.700
<v Speaker 4>So they probably didn't have a good accurate account of them.</v>

8122
03:45:48.701 --> 03:45:49.530
<v Speaker 4>That's for sure.</v>

8123
03:45:49.530 --> 03:45:50.830
<v Speaker 4>There was this got a family,</v>

8124
03:45:50.831 --> 03:45:54.250
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to make some phone nowadays there's a conservation mindset.</v>

8125
03:45:54.251 --> 03:45:56.950
<v Speaker 4>So we have the ability to look at numbers.</v>

8126
03:45:56.951 --> 03:45:58.840
<v Speaker 4>We look at caring capacity for the,</v>

8127
03:45:58.870 --> 03:45:59.460
<v Speaker 4>for the land,</v>

8128
03:45:59.460 --> 03:46:00.450
<v Speaker 4>and so we can kill.</v>

8129
03:46:02.640 --> 03:46:03.940
<v Speaker 4>It's like you will dream date.</v>

8130
03:46:04.080 --> 03:46:05.050
<v Speaker 4>What's your dream killed?</v>

8131
03:46:05.051 --> 03:46:05.351
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

8132
03:46:05.351 --> 03:46:09.850
<v Speaker 4>You know you got one man has got to be something that you want to kill before</v>

8133
03:46:09.851 --> 03:46:10.480
<v Speaker 4>you die.</v>

8134
03:46:10.480 --> 03:46:10.691
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

8135
03:46:10.691 --> 03:46:10.961
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

8136
03:46:10.961 --> 03:46:15.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean a human and now I like elk hunting.</v>

8137
03:46:15.310 --> 03:46:18.460
<v Speaker 4>If I only could hunt elk or one animal the rest of my life,</v>

8138
03:46:18.461 --> 03:46:18.940
<v Speaker 4>it'd be elk.</v>

8139
03:46:18.940 --> 03:46:21.370
<v Speaker 4>And that's what we were doing and fish and shit.</v>

8140
03:46:21.730 --> 03:46:22.121
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

8141
03:46:22.121 --> 03:46:22.870
<v Speaker 4>None of that stuff.</v>

8142
03:46:22.870 --> 03:46:24.250
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to go out into that.</v>

8143
03:46:24.280 --> 03:46:25.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm into bone fish.</v>

8144
03:46:25.830 --> 03:46:27.130
<v Speaker 4>He's a socialist.</v>

8145
03:46:27.400 --> 03:46:27.671
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

8146
03:46:27.671 --> 03:46:28.960
<v Speaker 4>so the ultimate is an elk.</v>

03:46:28.990 --> 03:46:29.823
<v Speaker 4>What about you?</v>

8148

8150
03:46:37.120 --> 03:46:38.980
<v Speaker 4>You want to be able to eat and you save the head.</v>

<v Speaker 4>on the fucking wall or on the floor.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Six inches can kill polar bear.</v>

8182
03:47:40.800 --> 03:47:42.490
<v Speaker 4>Put your mind into it and he said,</v>

03:48:12.220 --> 03:48:13.600
<v Speaker 4>It's an optical illusion.</v>

8205
03:48:13.601 --> 03:48:16.330
<v Speaker 4>You know you hold it so close to the camera at appears big butt.</v>

<v Speaker 4>because there's looks that looks like it's nine feet tall.</v>

8208
03:48:22.210 --> 03:48:25.360
<v Speaker 4>What was it that normal that bear was nine foot six inches.</v>

8215
03:48:30.560 --> 03:48:31.241
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

8220
03:48:36.621 --> 03:48:38.630
<v Speaker 6>Gnosis how many times did you have to hit it?</v>

8221
03:48:38.680 --> 03:48:40.550
<v Speaker 6>Just one Arrow in the head.</v>

8222
03:48:40.730 --> 03:48:41.430

8223
03:48:41.430 --> 03:48:42.550
<v Speaker 6>went out right in the heart.</v>

8224
03:48:42.560 --> 03:48:43.393
<v Speaker 6>Lungs.</v>

8225
03:48:43.730 --> 03:48:45.260
<v Speaker 6>The lungs take out the lungs.</v>

8226
03:48:45.460 --> 03:48:47.150
<v Speaker 6>God Damn Long.</v>

8227
03:48:47.160 --> 03:48:48.350
<v Speaker 6>It's two minutes.</v>

8228
03:48:48.351 --> 03:48:49.184
<v Speaker 6>Three minutes.</v>

8229
03:48:49.310 --> 03:48:50.000
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

8230
03:48:50.000 --> 03:48:50.810
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

8231
03:48:50.810 --> 03:48:51.111
<v Speaker 6>let's see.</v>

8232
03:48:51.111 --> 03:48:54.470
<v Speaker 6>That one was dead and about 30 seconds.</v>

8233
03:48:54.530 --> 03:48:55.363
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

8234
03:48:55.850 --> 03:48:56.690
<v Speaker 6>You didn't have to go up,</v>

8235
03:48:56.720 --> 03:48:57.790
<v Speaker 6>go kneel on the band.</v>

8236
03:48:57.791 --> 03:48:58.041
<v Speaker 6>I'm in.</v>

8237
03:48:58.041 --> 03:49:00.350
<v Speaker 6>Throw some old d tours down in the belly.</v>

8238
03:49:00.770 --> 03:49:05.770
<v Speaker 6>It's hard for people to imagine that you need to control the population of</v>

8239
03:49:06.531 --> 03:49:07.550
<v Speaker 6>certain animals.</v>

8240
03:49:07.700 --> 03:49:08.380
<v Speaker 6>It's hard for,</v>

8241
03:49:08.380 --> 03:49:08.950
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

8242
03:49:08.950 --> 03:49:10.400
<v Speaker 6>that's a weird one for people.</v>

8243
03:49:10.450 --> 03:49:10.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

8244
03:49:10.700 --> 03:49:11.810
<v Speaker 6>It's like you're not going to eat it,</v>

8245
03:49:11.811 --> 03:49:12.770
<v Speaker 6>but you need to kill it.</v>

8246
03:49:12.800 --> 03:49:13.940
<v Speaker 6>Why do you guys need to kill it?</v>

8247
03:49:13.970 --> 03:49:14.210
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

8248
03:49:14.210 --> 03:49:17.670
<v Speaker 6>I mentioned that today and too confusing conversations.</v>

8249
03:49:17.680 --> 03:49:18.620
<v Speaker 6>He would get upset.</v>

8250
03:49:18.680 --> 03:49:19.610
<v Speaker 6>I love bears.</v>

8251
03:49:19.640 --> 03:49:21.350
<v Speaker 6>They're beautiful and all that shit,</v>

8252
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:22.663
<v Speaker 6>but hey,</v>

8253
03:49:22.820 --> 03:49:23.653
<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>

8254
03:49:24.050 --> 03:49:24.883
<v Speaker 6>I don't mind that.</v>

8255
03:49:25.040 --> 03:49:25.251
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

8256
03:49:25.251 --> 03:49:26.240
<v Speaker 6>what do you love bears.</v>

8257
03:49:26.570 --> 03:49:30.110
<v Speaker 6>I love bear and the cartoons and I got her home washed.</v>

8258
03:49:30.540 --> 03:49:31.373
<v Speaker 6>Brainwashed as,</v>

8259
03:49:31.720 --> 03:49:35.270
<v Speaker 6>but I don't want to be attacked by no goddamn bear.</v>

8260
03:49:35.540 --> 03:49:38.540
<v Speaker 6>So if that fear was eliminated,</v>

8261
03:49:38.541 --> 03:49:41.720
<v Speaker 6>1000% maybe more fucking Mexicans would go in the woods.</v>

8262
03:49:42.920 --> 03:49:45.770
<v Speaker 6>A strong Mexican would presence is not there.</v>

8263
03:49:46.630 --> 03:49:48.680
<v Speaker 6>I thought that's why we stay in the cities.</v>

8264
03:49:48.980 --> 03:49:50.990
<v Speaker 6>Well bears are fucking legitimately scary.</v>

8265
03:49:51.020 --> 03:49:53.840
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure you saw that video that was going around just a couple of days ago of a</v>

8266
03:49:53.841 --> 03:49:54.450
<v Speaker 6>guy who's a,</v>

8267
03:49:54.450 --> 03:49:56.690
<v Speaker 6>he's a knifemaker Montana.</v>

8268
03:49:56.691 --> 03:50:00.400
<v Speaker 6>He was up in the woods and he got attacked by a mama bear and he got attacked</v>

8269
03:50:00.410 --> 03:50:00.950
<v Speaker 6>twice.</v>

8270
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:01.770
<v Speaker 6>He got away White,</v>

8271
03:50:01.770 --> 03:50:02.900
<v Speaker 6>sprayed with the bear spray.</v>

8272
03:50:02.901 --> 03:50:03.860
<v Speaker 6>She's still got ahold of him.</v>

8273
03:50:03.861 --> 03:50:06.560
<v Speaker 6>He got away and then he got away a second time.</v>

8274
03:50:06.620 --> 03:50:08.500
<v Speaker 6>Is that the need to get away from it?</v>

8275
03:50:08.910 --> 03:50:12.950
<v Speaker 6>Does that beer spray legit cause I was making fun of the guy in like no,</v>

8276
03:50:12.951 --> 03:50:14.170
<v Speaker 6>the beer space kind of legit.</v>

8277
03:50:15.690 --> 03:50:17.330
<v Speaker 6>I would believe it better than the cartilage it,</v>

8278
03:50:17.331 --> 03:50:18.620
<v Speaker 6>but it doesn't work always.</v>

8279
03:50:18.621 --> 03:50:19.700
<v Speaker 6>It didn't work in this case.</v>

8280
03:50:20.850 --> 03:50:21.740
<v Speaker 6>That's this guy.</v>

8281
03:50:22.190 --> 03:50:22.491
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

8282
03:50:22.491 --> 03:50:22.641

<v Speaker 6>You see as down to the bone right there.</v>

8287
03:50:31.161 --> 03:50:31.441
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

03:50:36.350 --> 03:50:37.690
<v Speaker 6>He was scouting for outlook.</v>

8301
03:50:52.890 --> 03:50:53.660
<v Speaker 6>Yellowstone.</v>

8302
03:50:53.660 --> 03:50:54.200
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

8303
03:50:54.200 --> 03:50:55.033
<v Speaker 6>if there's a beer,</v>

8304
03:50:55.070 --> 03:51:00.070
<v Speaker 6>everyone lays down and they'd stumble upon a fucking black bear and he lays down</v>

8305
03:51:00.561 --> 03:51:02.330
<v Speaker 6>and all the other troops are watching the beers.</v>

8306
03:51:02.331 --> 03:51:02.840
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

8307
03:51:02.840 --> 03:51:06.590
<v Speaker 6>look at this fucking idiot and just ate them in front of the troops.</v>

8308
03:51:06.950 --> 03:51:07.940
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

8309
03:51:08.030 --> 03:51:09.830
<v Speaker 6>Was that on Youtube?</v>

8310
03:51:09.920 --> 03:51:11.240
<v Speaker 6>It's on all over it.</v>

8311
03:51:12.690 --> 03:51:13.523
<v Speaker 6>To me,</v>

8312
03:51:14.150 --> 03:51:15.410
<v Speaker 6>there's a real difference.</v>

8313
03:51:15.680 --> 03:51:18.740
<v Speaker 6>There's a real difference between the behavior of black bears and brown bears.</v>

8314
03:51:18.741 --> 03:51:23.741
<v Speaker 6>And what's really weird is it more black bears attack people as predators versus</v>

8315
03:51:25.260 --> 03:51:26.340
<v Speaker 6>more brown</v>

8316
03:51:26.340 --> 03:51:30.000
<v Speaker 5>bears attack people out of shock like a brown bear.</v>

8317
03:51:30.001 --> 03:51:32.340
<v Speaker 5>Like what happened with this guy is what happens all the time?</v>

8318
03:51:32.580 --> 03:51:37.580
<v Speaker 5>You fuck up and you get near a mama with her cubs and she just rips you apart.</v>

8319
03:51:38.430 --> 03:51:42.390
<v Speaker 5>That's what happens to most of these guys when they play dead.</v>

8320
03:51:42.600 --> 03:51:45.520
<v Speaker 5>There's a different reaction when a black bear gets you.</v>

8321
03:51:45.521 --> 03:51:47.400
<v Speaker 5>If a black bear gets you and you played dead,</v>

8322
03:51:47.790 --> 03:51:51.480
<v Speaker 5>he might think you're dead and just started eating pass first.</v>

8323
03:51:52.080 --> 03:51:52.913
<v Speaker 5>The general,</v>

8324
03:51:53.610 --> 03:51:54.030
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

8325
03:51:54.030 --> 03:51:55.080
<v Speaker 5>the first was coyotes.</v>

8326
03:51:55.081 --> 03:51:56.310
<v Speaker 5>I think beer too.</v>

8327
03:51:56.430 --> 03:51:57.263
<v Speaker 5>What you want to do,</v>

8328
03:51:58.030 --> 03:52:00.210
<v Speaker 5>the thought has been wipers are the worst.</v>

8329
03:52:00.211 --> 03:52:01.044
<v Speaker 5>The polar bear,</v>

8330
03:52:01.350 --> 03:52:02.310
<v Speaker 5>they're the worst.</v>

8331
03:52:02.340 --> 03:52:03.190
<v Speaker 5>That's racist.</v>

8332
03:52:05.260 --> 03:52:06.730
<v Speaker 5>Polar bears are the worst.</v>

8333
03:52:06.750 --> 03:52:07.321
<v Speaker 5>The worst there.</v>

8334
03:52:07.321 --> 03:52:08.041
<v Speaker 5>Why not here?</v>

8335
03:52:08.041 --> 03:52:13.041
<v Speaker 5>The thing is clear that there's with polar bears is their hair is clear up.</v>

8336
03:52:13.621 --> 03:52:14.454
<v Speaker 5>Her skin is,</v>

8337
03:52:14.490 --> 03:52:15.160
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing,</v>

8338
03:52:15.160 --> 03:52:16.140
<v Speaker 5>why did he say,</v>

8339
03:52:16.170 --> 03:52:17.460
<v Speaker 5>how can you say their hair is clear?</v>

8340
03:52:17.461 --> 03:52:18.840
<v Speaker 5>I'm going back on one of the year.</v>

8341
03:52:18.960 --> 03:52:22.520
<v Speaker 5>How can we say the Harris clear when it's actually white as fuck,</v>

8342
03:52:22.800 --> 03:52:23.580
<v Speaker 5>but it's clear.</v>

8343
03:52:23.580 --> 03:52:24.450
<v Speaker 5>They say it's clear.</v>

8344
03:52:27.600 --> 03:52:28.411
<v Speaker 5>You're not knowing region.</v>

8345
03:52:28.411 --> 03:52:29.244
<v Speaker 5>Your white.</v>

8346
03:52:29.340 --> 03:52:30.110
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

8347
03:52:30.110 --> 03:52:31.430
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] don't they say that they,</v>

8348
03:52:31.470 --> 03:52:33.690
<v Speaker 5>I think they described their hair is being clear.</v>

8349
03:52:33.760 --> 03:52:35.040
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly what they say.</v>

8350
03:52:35.041 --> 03:52:35.940
<v Speaker 5>I exclaimed white.</v>

8351
03:52:35.941 --> 03:52:37.380
<v Speaker 5>It's actually transparency.</v>

8352
03:52:37.381 --> 03:52:41.250
<v Speaker 5>It holds no color and appears to be white because it reflects visual light.</v>

8353
03:52:41.490 --> 03:52:42.323
<v Speaker 5>I've seen,</v>

8354
03:52:42.780 --> 03:52:44.040
<v Speaker 5>I've seen polar bears guide.</v>

8355
03:52:44.041 --> 03:52:47.670
<v Speaker 5>That was why was saying that's why I'm confused,</v>

8356
03:52:47.671 --> 03:52:49.200
<v Speaker 5>but also polar bears at the zoo.</v>

8357
03:52:49.201 --> 03:52:50.730
<v Speaker 5>It's not going off white snow.</v>

8358
03:52:50.731 --> 03:52:51.564
<v Speaker 5>It's going off.</v>

8359
03:52:51.910 --> 03:52:52.743
<v Speaker 5>There's still,</v>

8360
03:52:52.820 --> 03:52:53.190
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

8361
03:52:53.190 --> 03:52:54.023
<v Speaker 5>there's still a white,</v>

8362
03:52:54.040 --> 03:52:56.940
<v Speaker 5>the first actually transparent and holds no color.</v>

8363
03:52:57.030 --> 03:52:57.781
<v Speaker 5>It only appears.</v>

8364
03:52:57.781 --> 03:52:57.961
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

8365
03:52:57.961 --> 03:52:59.250
<v Speaker 5>Because it reflects visible.</v>

8366
03:52:59.520 --> 03:53:00.840
<v Speaker 5>Then it would look like a jellyfish.</v>

8367
03:53:01.520 --> 03:53:03.120
<v Speaker 5>The ocean come on the case.</v>

8368
03:53:03.121 --> 03:53:05.040
<v Speaker 5>That a technicality though because</v>

8369
03:53:06.750 --> 03:53:10.290
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't all color reflect visible light in some way.</v>

8370
03:53:10.320 --> 03:53:11.153
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

8371
03:53:11.970 --> 03:53:12.271
<v Speaker 5>Jamie?</v>

8372
03:53:12.271 --> 03:53:12.601
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

8373
03:53:12.601 --> 03:53:13.670
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>

8374
03:53:15.990 --> 03:53:16.651
<v Speaker 10>Can we it on her up?</v>

8375
03:53:16.651 --> 03:53:17.484
<v Speaker 10>I'm pretty sure like,</v>

8376
03:53:17.650 --> 03:53:18.483
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

8377
03:53:18.510 --> 03:53:21.090
<v Speaker 10>I think like black reflects or absorbs all light.</v>

8378
03:53:21.091 --> 03:53:21.924
<v Speaker 10>It's one of those,</v>

8379
03:53:23.500 --> 03:53:24.333
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

8380
03:53:27.530 --> 03:53:28.850
<v Speaker 5>Once it jumps in the water,</v>

8381
03:53:28.851 --> 03:53:30.170
<v Speaker 5>why is it still white dude?</v>

8382
03:53:30.240 --> 03:53:34.400
<v Speaker 5>Lights change color based on how much or rather colors,</v>

8383
03:53:34.580 --> 03:53:38.120
<v Speaker 5>whether change their Hughes based on how much light is there.</v>

8384
03:53:40.440 --> 03:53:41.870
<v Speaker 5>But they look to us</v>

8385
03:53:41.980 --> 03:53:43.200
<v Speaker 10>a color is a,</v>

8386
03:53:43.320 --> 03:53:45.580
<v Speaker 10>a frequency on the spectrum of light.</v>

8387
03:53:46.290 --> 03:53:47.230
<v Speaker 10>So your Sam,</v>

8388
03:53:47.290 --> 03:53:48.190
<v Speaker 10>that frequency,</v>

8389
03:53:48.300 --> 03:53:49.133
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

8390
03:53:49.600 --> 03:53:50.530
<v Speaker 10>It's all there.</v>

8391
03:53:50.560 --> 03:53:54.270
<v Speaker 10>It's like technically our eyes are only seeing a certain uh,</v>

8392
03:53:56.410 --> 03:53:58.090
<v Speaker 10>gauge or level of that frequency.</v>

8393
03:53:58.091 --> 03:53:59.590
<v Speaker 10>Like hearing is the same thing.</v>

8394
03:53:59.591 --> 03:54:00.850
<v Speaker 10>It's also on a frequency.</v>

8395
03:54:01.060 --> 03:54:01.391
<v Speaker 10>All,</v>

8396
03:54:01.391 --> 03:54:02.800
<v Speaker 10>all audio is draft frequency.</v>

8397
03:54:02.801 --> 03:54:05.050
<v Speaker 10>You can only hear 20 hertz to 20,000 Hertz.</v>

8398
03:54:05.410 --> 03:54:06.670
<v Speaker 10>Light is very similar.</v>

8399
03:54:06.671 --> 03:54:07.810
<v Speaker 10>It's not the same kind of hurts,</v>

8400
03:54:07.811 --> 03:54:08.830
<v Speaker 10>the same kind of waves,</v>

8401
03:54:09.250 --> 03:54:10.720
<v Speaker 10>but in a very similar way.</v>

8402
03:54:10.721 --> 03:54:14.200
<v Speaker 10>Like once you get to infrared as a way higher frequency than what we can</v>

8403
03:54:14.201 --> 03:54:14.711
<v Speaker 10>actually see.</v>

8404
03:54:14.711 --> 03:54:17.560
<v Speaker 10>And that's sort of what it's getting into saying here through reflecting light,</v>

8405
03:54:17.561 --> 03:54:18.041
<v Speaker 10>they only,</v>

8406
03:54:18.041 --> 03:54:20.380
<v Speaker 10>we can see a very fucked up version of it.</v>

8407
03:54:21.100 --> 03:54:22.230
<v Speaker 5>Sorry Jamie,</v>

8408
03:54:23.980 --> 03:54:24.750
<v Speaker 6>I'm proud of you.</v>

8409
03:54:24.750 --> 03:54:27.790
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] nickname is Jamie Phd.</v>

8410
03:54:28.360 --> 03:54:28.840
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

8411
03:54:28.840 --> 03:54:29.700
<v Speaker 6>That's young Jamie,</v>

8412
03:54:29.850 --> 03:54:32.650
<v Speaker 6>Jamie smart school down some phd type Shit.</v>

8413
03:54:32.740 --> 03:54:33.573
<v Speaker 6>So all that,</v>

8414
03:54:33.630 --> 03:54:34.570
<v Speaker 6>he certainly did.</v>

8415
03:54:35.070 --> 03:54:35.380
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

8416
03:54:35.380 --> 03:54:36.840
<v Speaker 6>so all this stuff about their,</v>

8417
03:54:36.850 --> 03:54:37.870
<v Speaker 6>their white skin,</v>

8418
03:54:37.871 --> 03:54:38.531
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure.</v>

8419
03:54:38.531 --> 03:54:40.600
<v Speaker 6>I understand that Mexico,</v>

8420
03:54:41.680 --> 03:54:43.600
<v Speaker 6>they have black skin right underneath all that.</v>

8421
03:54:43.630 --> 03:54:45.520
<v Speaker 6>I think they're really dark and hoses.</v>

8422
03:54:45.580 --> 03:54:45.971
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

8423
03:54:45.971 --> 03:54:46.804
<v Speaker 6>I think they're actually,</v>

8424
03:54:47.080 --> 03:54:49.690
<v Speaker 6>they have a dark body underneath all that stuff.</v>

8425
03:54:51.880 --> 03:54:53.260
<v Speaker 6>It's a weird animal man.</v>

8426
03:54:53.350 --> 03:54:54.380
<v Speaker 6>They just up their jacking.</v>

8427
03:54:54.381 --> 03:54:54.700
<v Speaker 6>Shit.</v>

8428
03:54:54.700 --> 03:54:56.650
<v Speaker 6>They don't have a single piece of vegetable.</v>

8429
03:54:56.990 --> 03:54:58.540
<v Speaker 6>So you can't really kill plants.</v>

8430
03:54:58.950 --> 03:54:59.190
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

8431
03:54:59.190 --> 03:55:00.160
<v Speaker 6>Cause there's not a ton of them.</v>

8432
03:55:00.590 --> 03:55:02.110
<v Speaker 6>Now you're not polar bear hunt.</v>

8433
03:55:02.111 --> 03:55:02.470
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

8434
03:55:02.470 --> 03:55:03.730
<v Speaker 6>I have a polar bear.</v>

8435
03:55:03.731 --> 03:55:06.790
<v Speaker 6>Had to fight a grizzly bear and I'm sure they'd been on borders where like every</v>

8436
03:55:06.791 --> 03:55:07.930
<v Speaker 6>now and then like bitch,</v>

8437
03:55:08.260 --> 03:55:10.420
<v Speaker 6>the snow is mine and was like,</v>

8438
03:55:10.421 --> 03:55:10.721
<v Speaker 6>bitch,</v>

8439
03:55:10.721 --> 03:55:11.920
<v Speaker 6>this the mountains are mine.</v>

8440
03:55:11.980 --> 03:55:12.700
<v Speaker 6>Look at this shit.</v>

8441
03:55:12.700 --> 03:55:15.940
<v Speaker 6>Has there ever been a polar bear versus grizzly bear match?</v>

8442
03:55:15.970 --> 03:55:20.530
<v Speaker 6>Polar bears is so well insulated by inches of blubber and for that they're heat</v>

8443
03:55:20.531 --> 03:55:25.531
<v Speaker 6>signature is nearly invisible through infrared photography to him young Jamie's</v>

8444
03:55:25.600 --> 03:55:26.530
<v Speaker 6>on the ball.</v>

8445
03:55:26.920 --> 03:55:27.753
<v Speaker 6>Damn the guy.</v>

8446
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.910
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Make fucking sounds did.</v>

8448
03:55:30.160 --> 03:55:30.431
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

8449
03:55:30.431 --> 03:55:35.230
<v Speaker 6>Kanye West is going to make a sound studio off bare blubber dude.</v>

8450
03:55:35.231 --> 03:55:36.160
<v Speaker 6>You could barely see them.</v>

8451
03:55:36.630 --> 03:55:37.000
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

8452
03:55:37.000 --> 03:55:38.620
<v Speaker 6>I think this is what you'd be getting into.</v>

8453
03:55:39.280 --> 03:55:39.910
<v Speaker 6>It's all good.</v>

8454
03:55:39.910 --> 03:55:40.361
<v Speaker 6>He knew.</v>

8455
03:55:40.361 --> 03:55:43.000
<v Speaker 6>I told him you mad.</v>

8456
03:55:43.050 --> 03:55:44.200
<v Speaker 6>So it's like,</v>

8457
03:55:44.560 --> 03:55:45.730
<v Speaker 6>it's like a lot of things in life.</v>

8458
03:55:45.731 --> 03:55:46.690
<v Speaker 6>You have to experience it.</v>

8459
03:55:46.800 --> 03:55:47.390
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

8460
03:55:47.390 --> 03:55:48.280
<v Speaker 6>Once you experience it,</v>

8461
03:55:48.790 --> 03:55:49.870
<v Speaker 6>you know an actual fight.</v>

8462
03:55:49.871 --> 03:55:50.704
<v Speaker 6>Companion.</v>

8463
03:55:50.850 --> 03:55:51.310
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

8464
03:55:51.310 --> 03:55:52.143
<v Speaker 6>These things go.</v>

8465
03:55:52.860 --> 03:55:53.381
<v Speaker 6>They go,</v>

8466
03:55:53.381 --> 03:55:54.520
<v Speaker 6>they go down the tracks,</v>

8467
03:55:54.521 --> 03:55:56.200
<v Speaker 6>they take turns and goes into the woods.</v>

8468
03:55:56.410 --> 03:55:57.161
<v Speaker 6>We've got to cover up.</v>

8469
03:55:57.161 --> 03:55:58.210
<v Speaker 6>You're knocking over trees.</v>

8470
03:55:58.240 --> 03:55:59.073
<v Speaker 6>They get the,</v>

8471
03:56:00.750 --> 03:56:02.140
<v Speaker 6>it was always fine man.</v>

8472
03:56:02.170 --> 03:56:02.531
<v Speaker 6>Listen,</v>

8473
03:56:02.531 --> 03:56:03.180
<v Speaker 6>these are awesome.</v>

8474
03:56:03.180 --> 03:56:03.791
<v Speaker 6>It's harder.</v>

8475
03:56:03.791 --> 03:56:04.780
<v Speaker 6>What's beautiful about these?</v>

8476
03:56:04.781 --> 03:56:06.940
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing to be sorry for everybody's used to it.</v>

8477
03:56:06.970 --> 03:56:07.803
<v Speaker 6>Listen,</v>

8478
03:56:09.220 --> 03:56:09.791
<v Speaker 6>it's just what?</v>

8479
03:56:09.791 --> 03:56:11.110
<v Speaker 6>What's fun about these things?</v>

8480
03:56:11.111 --> 03:56:11.970
<v Speaker 6>Is there chaos?</v>

8481
03:56:12.000 --> 03:56:15.460
<v Speaker 6>I was excited to be involved and I learned one thing.</v>

8482
03:56:15.520 --> 03:56:16.810
<v Speaker 6>I can't show favoritism.</v>

8483
03:56:17.280 --> 03:56:18.060
<v Speaker 6>It's a core.</v>

8484
03:56:18.060 --> 03:56:19.270
<v Speaker 6>You can is important.</v>

8485
03:56:19.520 --> 03:56:20.021
<v Speaker 6>You gotta look,</v>

8486
03:56:20.021 --> 03:56:21.090
<v Speaker 6>you gotta be open minded.</v>

8487
03:56:21.970 --> 03:56:26.590
<v Speaker 6>I didn't want veto power or Dan can do whatever you want to talk shit.</v>

8488
03:56:26.591 --> 03:56:30.700
<v Speaker 6>And I'm talking about it through my perspective as a commentator.</v>

8489
03:56:30.701 --> 03:56:31.534
<v Speaker 6>He can't show.</v>

8490
03:56:31.560 --> 03:56:34.150
<v Speaker 6>The problem is you've got to keep the dialogue going.</v>

8491
03:56:34.151 --> 03:56:35.410
<v Speaker 6>So if there's really nothing,</v>

8492
03:56:36.010 --> 03:56:39.250
<v Speaker 6>the last resort is I'm going to talk show and you just fucking sad cause I ain't</v>

8493
03:56:39.251 --> 03:56:40.084
<v Speaker 6>got none now.</v>

8494
03:56:40.270 --> 03:56:40.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

8495
03:56:40.720 --> 03:56:41.760
<v Speaker 6>So you got to keep the goals.</v>

8496
03:56:41.790 --> 03:56:42.790
<v Speaker 6>That's what happens a lot.</v>

8497
03:56:42.791 --> 03:56:43.570
<v Speaker 6>You're like fuck,</v>

8498
03:56:43.570 --> 03:56:44.381
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry bro.</v>

8499
03:56:44.381 --> 03:56:45.041
<v Speaker 6>It's for the show.</v>

8500
03:56:45.041 --> 03:56:46.980
<v Speaker 6>With a sacrifice for the team.</v>

8501
03:56:46.990 --> 03:56:48.290
<v Speaker 6>We're going to sacrifice you.</v>

8502
03:56:48.790 --> 03:56:49.001
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

8503
03:56:49.001 --> 03:56:50.260
<v Speaker 6>Like as a commentator man,</v>

8504
03:56:50.261 --> 03:56:53.190
<v Speaker 6>it's really hard to not have favoritism like every morning.</v>

8505
03:56:53.230 --> 03:56:54.430
<v Speaker 6>Twice as much.</v>

8506
03:56:54.490 --> 03:56:55.600
<v Speaker 6>You talked too much.</v>

8507
03:56:55.601 --> 03:56:56.434
<v Speaker 6>Shut out.</v>

8508
03:56:56.640 --> 03:56:59.380

8512
03:57:06.580 --> 03:57:11.460
<v Speaker 6>nine seconds of dead air pockets everywhere on the show that was normal.</v>

8513
03:57:11.461 --> 03:57:14.770
<v Speaker 6>And this show in any show like that was normal podcast.</v>

8514
03:57:15.430 --> 03:57:16.450
<v Speaker 6>If anything,</v>

03:57:16.570 --> 03:57:17.350
<v Speaker 6>anything.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You got to keep going on.</v>

8518

03:57:24.370 --> 03:57:24.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

8531
03:57:35.370 --> 03:57:36.130
<v Speaker 6>I think so.</v>

8532
03:57:36.130 --> 03:57:36.801
<v Speaker 6>Some fights.</v>

8533
03:57:36.801 --> 03:57:38.070
<v Speaker 6>It's important to give Debbie.</v>

8534
03:57:38.071 --> 03:57:38.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

8535
03:57:38.430 --> 03:57:39.920
<v Speaker 6>you've got to figure out when to do it though.</v>

8536
03:57:39.921 --> 03:57:40.820
<v Speaker 6>And I'm not always right.</v>

8537
03:57:40.821 --> 03:57:41.780
<v Speaker 6>I fuck it up a lot.</v>

8538
03:57:42.320 --> 03:57:44.530
<v Speaker 6>It's just cause it's your Ad Libbing like pee.</v>

8539
03:57:44.531 --> 03:57:48.200
<v Speaker 6>If people complain about like commentaries on one way or another way.</v>

8540
03:57:48.201 --> 03:57:51.740
<v Speaker 6>I'm just trying to do my best and sometimes it's a slippery thing.</v>

8541
03:57:51.741 --> 03:57:54.200
<v Speaker 6>Like when people are fighting and crazy shit's going on.</v>

8542
03:57:54.201 --> 03:57:54.720
<v Speaker 6>Passion,</v>

8543
03:57:54.720 --> 03:57:55.130
<v Speaker 6>passionate.</v>

8544
03:57:55.130 --> 03:57:57.950
<v Speaker 6>And also you might not recognize everything that's happening.</v>

8545
03:57:57.951 --> 03:57:58.784
<v Speaker 6>Things happen.</v>

8546
03:57:59.000 --> 03:58:00.680
<v Speaker 6>You're looking for patterns and striking,</v>

8547
03:58:00.681 --> 03:58:01.940
<v Speaker 6>but you're also looking for,</v>

8548
03:58:01.941 --> 03:58:05.780
<v Speaker 6>you know like someone slowing down is a lot of shit you're looking for.</v>

8549
03:58:06.010 --> 03:58:06.290
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

8550
03:58:06.290 --> 03:58:07.040
<v Speaker 6>It's a weird,</v>

8551
03:58:07.040 --> 03:58:07.873
<v Speaker 6>it's a weird gig.</v>

8552
03:58:08.180 --> 03:58:08.880
<v Speaker 6>The crazy thing,</v>

8553
03:58:08.880 --> 03:58:09.470
<v Speaker 6>that's hard.</v>

8554
03:58:09.470 --> 03:58:11.720
<v Speaker 6>We talked about this years,</v>

8555
03:58:11.900 --> 03:58:14.720
<v Speaker 6>years ago when you first started commentating for the UFC,</v>

8556
03:58:14.721 --> 03:58:16.850
<v Speaker 6>like as a fantasy.</v>

8557
03:58:17.090 --> 03:58:22.090
<v Speaker 6>Wouldn't it be cool if somehow the owner of the UFC wanted you to be yourself</v>

8558
03:58:25.430 --> 03:58:28.100
<v Speaker 6>and wanted you to say whatever the fuck you want her to say?</v>

8559
03:58:28.130 --> 03:58:28.963
<v Speaker 6>Just like this.</v>

8560
03:58:29.060 --> 03:58:31.220
<v Speaker 6>It was a fantasy and now what's happening?</v>

8561
03:58:31.310 --> 03:58:32.510
<v Speaker 6>You can say whatever you want.</v>

8562
03:58:32.511 --> 03:58:33.970
<v Speaker 6>We're going to have to talk about it.</v>

8563
03:58:35.100 --> 03:58:35.840
<v Speaker 6>They'll show you.</v>

8564
03:58:35.840 --> 03:58:36.561
<v Speaker 6>It's a beautiful thing.</v>

8565
03:58:36.561 --> 03:58:38.210
<v Speaker 6>It's what's happening right now.</v>

8566
03:58:38.690 --> 03:58:39.320
<v Speaker 6>Shit,</v>

8567
03:58:39.320 --> 03:58:40.310
<v Speaker 6>no rules.</v>

8568
03:58:40.630 --> 03:58:44.930
<v Speaker 6>True can even bring into journals or dominoes fucking style,</v>

8569
03:58:45.440 --> 03:58:45.890
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

8570
03:58:45.890 --> 03:58:46.880
<v Speaker 6>And here's another thing,</v>

8571
03:58:47.150 --> 03:58:51.350
<v Speaker 6>friends who don't always agree on shit but still love each other,</v>

8572
03:58:51.410 --> 03:58:53.150
<v Speaker 6>have a great time hanging out and talking shit,</v>

8573
03:58:53.151 --> 03:58:53.900
<v Speaker 6>this motherfucker,</v>

8574
03:58:53.900 --> 03:58:55.670
<v Speaker 6>because he sounds do we hate each other.</v>

8575
03:58:56.030 --> 03:58:56.863
<v Speaker 6>We hate each other,</v>

8576
03:58:58.190 --> 03:59:00.050
<v Speaker 6>but you're trying to steal him away from me.</v>

8577
03:59:00.850 --> 03:59:01.740
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>

8578
03:59:01.741 --> 03:59:02.240
<v Speaker 6>guys go.</v>

8579
03:59:02.240 --> 03:59:03.073
<v Speaker 6>If that happened,</v>

8580
03:59:03.140 --> 03:59:03.973
<v Speaker 6>another</v>

8581
03:59:06.350 --> 03:59:07.183
<v Speaker 6>fucking men.</v>

8582
03:59:07.190 --> 03:59:08.023
<v Speaker 6>But you know what I mean?</v>

8583
03:59:08.070 --> 03:59:09.830
<v Speaker 6>My point is if there's an illusion,</v>

8584
03:59:10.040 --> 03:59:13.190
<v Speaker 6>it's an illusion that a lot of people suffer under and that illusion is that</v>

8585
03:59:13.191 --> 03:59:15.860
<v Speaker 6>someone has to think exactly like you for you to be their friend.</v>

8586
03:59:15.890 --> 03:59:16.280
<v Speaker 6>Oh No,</v>

8587
03:59:16.280 --> 03:59:19.040
<v Speaker 6>I take that shit is so stupid because there's a lot of people that have some</v>

8588
03:59:19.041 --> 03:59:21.020
<v Speaker 6>crazy ideas and I love him to death.</v>

8589
03:59:21.021 --> 03:59:22.460
<v Speaker 6>I give him a hug every time I see him.</v>

8590
03:59:22.730 --> 03:59:24.170
<v Speaker 6>And I only talked to him about certain shit.</v>

8591
03:59:24.580 --> 03:59:26.850
<v Speaker 6>Who wants to hang out with somebody exactly like that.</v>

8592
03:59:26.870 --> 03:59:26.940
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

8593
03:59:26.940 --> 03:59:28.070
<v Speaker 6>that'd be a lot of people do.</v>

8594
03:59:28.071 --> 03:59:28.700
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>

8595
03:59:28.700 --> 03:59:31.040
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people are scared of being themselves,</v>

8596
03:59:31.240 --> 03:59:31.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

8597
03:59:31.850 --> 03:59:32.170
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

8598
03:59:32.170 --> 03:59:33.350
<v Speaker 6>and so because of that,</v>

8599
03:59:33.351 --> 03:59:37.100
<v Speaker 6>they want to find like some comfortable frequency where it's like an accent that</v>

8600
03:59:37.101 --> 03:59:38.390
<v Speaker 6>everyone in the neighborhood has.</v>

8601
03:59:38.391 --> 03:59:38.690
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

8602
03:59:38.690 --> 03:59:42.350
<v Speaker 6>It's a way of thinking and behaving that reinforces the idea that you're on the</v>

8603
03:59:42.351 --> 03:59:43.670
<v Speaker 6>same team as everybody else.</v>

8604
03:59:44.060 --> 03:59:45.530
<v Speaker 6>It's a natural instinct that we have.</v>

8605
03:59:45.531 --> 03:59:46.700
<v Speaker 6>It's a tribal instinct.</v>

8606
03:59:46.720 --> 03:59:46.940
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

8607
03:59:46.940 --> 03:59:47.990
<v Speaker 6>I give any ship.</v>

8608
03:59:48.260 --> 03:59:52.130
<v Speaker 6>There's a couple of things he sent me links to and we've had long talks with</v>

8609
03:59:52.340 --> 03:59:53.240
<v Speaker 6>legit stuff.</v>

8610
03:59:53.241 --> 03:59:54.500
<v Speaker 6>Especially when it comes to my kids.</v>

8611
03:59:54.501 --> 03:59:55.850
<v Speaker 6>There's a fucking spectrum.</v>

8612
03:59:55.880 --> 03:59:56.780
<v Speaker 6>There's a spectrum.</v>

8613
03:59:56.781 --> 04:00:00.590
<v Speaker 6>People think it's a beautiful thing that people think all this drama that's</v>

8614
04:00:00.591 --> 04:00:01.011
<v Speaker 6>going on.</v>

8615
04:00:01.011 --> 04:00:04.790
<v Speaker 6>But me and Brendan were not like tight and going out and having fucking lunch</v>

8616
04:00:04.791 --> 04:00:05.181
<v Speaker 6>all the time.</v>

8617
04:00:05.181 --> 04:00:06.140
<v Speaker 6>But let me tell you,</v>

8618
04:00:06.350 --> 04:00:10.880
<v Speaker 6>I rarely go out to lunch with any friends or anything.</v>

8619
04:00:10.881 --> 04:00:11.990
<v Speaker 6>I don't hang out with anybody.</v>

8620
04:00:11.991 --> 04:00:14.090
<v Speaker 6>I have no time between all my schools.</v>

8621
04:00:14.240 --> 04:00:17.720
<v Speaker 6>It's just all my free time is my wife and my son.</v>

8622
04:00:18.170 --> 04:00:20.280
<v Speaker 6>Everything else is my wife</v>

8623
04:00:20.280 --> 04:00:20.791
<v Speaker 11>and my son.</v>

04:00:21.240 --> 04:00:22.320
<v Speaker 11>I don't hang out with anybody.</v>

8626
04:00:22.321 --> 04:00:23.160
<v Speaker 11>So I mean,</v>

8633
04:00:32.720 --> 04:00:34.410
<v Speaker 11>I've told them at least three times.</v>

<v Speaker 11>I don't remember shit.</v>

8636
04:00:39.660 --> 04:00:42.420

8725
04:03:25.850 --> 04:03:26.683
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>

8726
04:03:27.430 --> 04:03:30.730
<v Speaker 6>21st of October I'm going to be in Springfield.</v>

8727
04:03:30.790 --> 04:03:31.390
<v Speaker 6>Dammit.</v>

8728
04:03:31.390 --> 04:03:32.590
<v Speaker 6>Oregon grown on,</v>

8729
04:03:32.591 --> 04:03:34.090
<v Speaker 6>it's a bad motherfucker to planets.</v>

8730
04:03:34.110 --> 04:03:35.200
<v Speaker 6>Springfield in the house.</v>

8731
04:03:35.260 --> 04:03:36.940
<v Speaker 6>You know who we need to get in if he can,</v>

8732
04:03:36.941 --> 04:03:39.010
<v Speaker 6>we need to get Joe Schilling in for that one,</v>

8733
04:03:39.510 --> 04:03:39.751
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

8734
04:03:39.751 --> 04:03:40.270
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

8735
04:03:40.270 --> 04:03:40.770
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

8736
04:03:40.770 --> 04:03:41.603
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

8737
04:03:41.760 --> 04:03:46.360
<v Speaker 6>Because Joe was fighting to glory for launch and they showed that fight that we</v>

8738
04:03:46.361 --> 04:03:48.370
<v Speaker 6>saw at the forum would be where they live,</v>

8739
04:03:48.640 --> 04:03:52.180
<v Speaker 6>where they went into overtime and they did the extra rounds and fucking knocked</v>

8740
04:03:52.181 --> 04:03:52.720
<v Speaker 6>out back.</v>

8741
04:03:52.720 --> 04:03:53.411
<v Speaker 6>It was amazing.</v>

8742
04:03:53.411 --> 04:03:54.340
<v Speaker 6>Last man standing,</v>

8743
04:03:54.430 --> 04:03:58.460
<v Speaker 6>hey dude to do some more mountain running on October 23rd listen,</v>

8744
04:03:58.660 --> 04:04:00.160
<v Speaker 6>listen in Springfield</v>

8745
04:04:01.920 --> 04:04:03.820
<v Speaker 6>had a disc replaced in his back,</v>

8746
04:04:03.821 --> 04:04:05.110
<v Speaker 6>like pretty significant back.</v>

8747
04:04:05.140 --> 04:04:10.140
<v Speaker 6>Ivan's roll Jujitsu and over four months now I just had major back surgery so I</v>

8748
04:04:11.621 --> 04:04:15.720
<v Speaker 6>think I might take off the rest of the year just to be sure to safe smartly.</v>

8749
04:04:15.760 --> 04:04:16.450
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

8750
04:04:16.450 --> 04:04:17.920
<v Speaker 6>Cause when the doctor tells me,</v>

8751
04:04:18.340 --> 04:04:18.581
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

8752
04:04:18.581 --> 04:04:19.414
<v Speaker 6>I was on,</v>

8753
04:04:19.690 --> 04:04:20.110
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

8754
04:04:20.110 --> 04:04:22.090
<v Speaker 6>you can either get fusion on your desk,</v>

8755
04:04:22.120 --> 04:04:23.200
<v Speaker 6>which is last resort.</v>

8756
04:04:23.201 --> 04:04:25.420
<v Speaker 6>We just got to fucking screw everything together.</v>

8757
04:04:26.020 --> 04:04:27.340
<v Speaker 6>Or we could put a disk in,</v>

8758
04:04:27.620 --> 04:04:27.911
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

8759
04:04:27.911 --> 04:04:31.360
<v Speaker 6>There's people that are qualified for the desk and if you don't qualify for that</v>

8760
04:04:31.361 --> 04:04:31.650
<v Speaker 6>desk,</v>

8761
04:04:31.650 --> 04:04:31.901
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>

8762
04:04:31.901 --> 04:04:32.291
<v Speaker 6>you know what,</v>

8763
04:04:32.291 --> 04:04:33.250
<v Speaker 6>your shit so fucked up.</v>

8764
04:04:33.280 --> 04:04:36.580
<v Speaker 6>You got to fucking lock all that shit up with screws.</v>

8765
04:04:37.090 --> 04:04:38.230
<v Speaker 6>So I was on the fence.</v>

8766
04:04:38.410 --> 04:04:40.120
<v Speaker 6>So the doctor would sit me down and say,</v>

8767
04:04:41.270 --> 04:04:45.430
<v Speaker 6>what does this Jujitsu people picking you up and slamming you?</v>

8768
04:04:45.700 --> 04:04:45.971
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

8769
04:04:45.971 --> 04:04:46.421
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

8770
04:04:46.421 --> 04:04:47.254
<v Speaker 6>I'm not gonna really get,</v>

8771
04:04:47.830 --> 04:04:48.670
<v Speaker 6>are you?</v>

8772
04:04:48.910 --> 04:04:49.660
<v Speaker 6>Are you,</v>

8773
04:04:49.660 --> 04:04:50.560
<v Speaker 6>are they picking you up?</v>

8774
04:04:50.590 --> 04:04:51.700
<v Speaker 6>Is there impact?</v>

8775
04:04:52.270 --> 04:04:53.890
<v Speaker 6>And the fact that it was asking this question,</v>

8776
04:04:53.891 --> 04:04:54.341
<v Speaker 6>I was like no,</v>

8777
04:04:54.341 --> 04:04:54.521
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

8778
04:04:54.521 --> 04:04:54.671
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

8779
04:04:54.671 --> 04:04:55.301
<v Speaker 6>It's like dude,</v>

8780
04:04:55.301 --> 04:04:56.710
<v Speaker 6>I'm fucking pillow quarter guard.</v>

8781
04:04:57.490 --> 04:05:02.140
<v Speaker 6>And just clinch on mother fuckers aren't impact in my roles ever did.</v>

8782
04:05:02.160 --> 04:05:03.190
<v Speaker 6>Do you have any back issues?</v>

8783
04:05:03.191 --> 04:05:05.290
<v Speaker 6>Came all that running and hiking shit.</v>

8784
04:05:05.620 --> 04:05:07.480
<v Speaker 6>Cause that's the only thing that tightens me up is when I run,</v>

8785
04:05:07.510 --> 04:05:08.261
<v Speaker 6>I love running.</v>

8786
04:05:08.261 --> 04:05:09.820
<v Speaker 6>But that's what tightens my back.</v>

8787
04:05:09.900 --> 04:05:10.600
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

8788
04:05:10.600 --> 04:05:11.433
<v Speaker 6>you're pretty big.</v>

8789
04:05:11.590 --> 04:05:14.290
<v Speaker 6>You know that makes a difference on running for the pounding.</v>

8790
04:05:14.650 --> 04:05:15.760
<v Speaker 6>So it's tougher on your body.</v>

8791
04:05:15.790 --> 04:05:16.900
<v Speaker 6>But with all the hunter and anything,</v>

8792
04:05:16.901 --> 04:05:18.580
<v Speaker 6>you haven't had any injuries or knee problems?</v>

8793
04:05:18.581 --> 04:05:19.120
<v Speaker 6>Nothing.</v>

8794
04:05:19.120 --> 04:05:19.953
<v Speaker 6>But what's a,</v>

8795
04:05:20.290 --> 04:05:23.200
<v Speaker 6>what's a really big guy for a hundred a hundred mile?</v>

8796
04:05:23.690 --> 04:05:25.630
<v Speaker 6>Anybody who's been the biggest guys?</v>

8797
04:05:25.631 --> 04:05:27.850
<v Speaker 6>I mean nobody's ever over</v>

8798
04:05:29.680 --> 04:05:31.880
<v Speaker 6>one 80 so I can't do it.</v>

8799
04:05:32.490 --> 04:05:33.323
<v Speaker 6>You can't do it.</v>

8800
04:05:33.520 --> 04:05:34.353
<v Speaker 6>It's just to do it.</v>

8801
04:05:34.880 --> 04:05:37.740
<v Speaker 6>Talk about really what we're talking with Stephan struve.</v>

8802
04:05:37.741 --> 04:05:41.530
<v Speaker 6>I was thinking there's only like a certain amount of blood the that guy can get</v>

8803
04:05:41.620 --> 04:05:42.430
<v Speaker 6>to his body.</v>

8804
04:05:42.430 --> 04:05:42.731
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

8805
04:05:42.731 --> 04:05:44.470
<v Speaker 6>He's got so much body to deal with.</v>

8806
04:05:44.850 --> 04:05:45.401
<v Speaker 6>Like he's,</v>

8807
04:05:45.401 --> 04:05:49.420
<v Speaker 6>he's got his cardio can't be as good as the mighty mouse is just so big.</v>

8808
04:05:49.950 --> 04:05:52.930
<v Speaker 6>There's just so much blood has to keep pumping fuel from.</v>

8809
04:05:54.470 --> 04:05:55.650
<v Speaker 6>I run 40 year and laughed.</v>

8810
04:05:55.660 --> 04:05:58.570
<v Speaker 6>I run 14 miles a week for a bigger guy.</v>

8811
04:05:58.580 --> 04:06:00.010
<v Speaker 6>Loved his size.</v>

8812
04:06:00.011 --> 04:06:04.900
<v Speaker 6>Might not be like I have anything to do with the UFC fight though.</v>

8813
04:06:05.170 --> 04:06:07.630
<v Speaker 6>Maybe if he was headed like survive the apocalypse,</v>

8814
04:06:07.890 --> 04:06:08.830
<v Speaker 6>he would see the difference.</v>

8815
04:06:08.831 --> 04:06:10.690
<v Speaker 6>But I don't think you'd see the difference.</v>

8816
04:06:10.840 --> 04:06:14.200
<v Speaker 6>Like could just cause he's seven foot that he's going to have shitty cardio.</v>

8817
04:06:14.380 --> 04:06:14.591
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

8818
04:06:14.591 --> 04:06:15.560
<v Speaker 6>I'm just saying that you're,</v>

8819
04:06:15.561 --> 04:06:16.070
<v Speaker 6>when you're to</v>

8820
04:06:16.070 --> 04:06:19.430
<v Speaker 5>65 I think there's a magic number and I think there's a lot of guys agree with</v>

8821
04:06:19.431 --> 04:06:21.380
<v Speaker 5>this and it's around where steeply Mijo chick is.</v>

8822
04:06:21.650 --> 04:06:25.010
<v Speaker 5>It's around where Cain Velasquez is set to 40 number.</v>

8823
04:06:25.220 --> 04:06:28.310
<v Speaker 5>It seems like two forties as heavy as you want to get cause you can handle a guy</v>

8824
04:06:28.311 --> 04:06:31.940
<v Speaker 5>that's two 65 because at 25 pound differential,</v>

8825
04:06:32.120 --> 04:06:33.520
<v Speaker 5>although it seems like a big deal,</v>

8826
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:36.260
<v Speaker 5>like if if the skills better it,</v>

8827
04:06:36.290 --> 04:06:39.380
<v Speaker 5>it plays itself out because it's 25 pound differential.</v>

8828
04:06:39.381 --> 04:06:39.801
<v Speaker 5>That guy,</v>

8829
04:06:39.801 --> 04:06:43.060
<v Speaker 5>that 265 pound guy or bigger and cutting down to it,</v>

8830
04:06:43.210 --> 04:06:48.210
<v Speaker 5>it has such a giant reservoir that he needs to fill also slower,</v>

8831
04:06:48.680 --> 04:06:50.560
<v Speaker 5>slower speed but cardio,</v>

8832
04:06:50.710 --> 04:06:53.030
<v Speaker 5>but if you're a two 40 and you got Brock Lesnar,</v>

8833
04:06:53.180 --> 04:06:53.770
<v Speaker 5>that's not good.</v>

8834
04:06:53.770 --> 04:06:56.360
<v Speaker 5>That's not true because that's what Cain Velasquez did to him.</v>

8835
04:06:56.510 --> 04:06:57.343
<v Speaker 5>He worked him.</v>

8836
04:06:57.740 --> 04:06:58.521
<v Speaker 5>Brock took him down,</v>

8837
04:06:58.521 --> 04:07:01.490
<v Speaker 5>he got right back up and Brock got tired and Cain did not.</v>

8838
04:07:01.670 --> 04:07:04.850
<v Speaker 5>And Kane started beating on him with perfect striking because we've heard pop</v>

8839
04:07:04.851 --> 04:07:05.061
<v Speaker 5>pop,</v>

8840
04:07:05.061 --> 04:07:06.590
<v Speaker 5>pop and and Brock was like,</v>

8841
04:07:06.620 --> 04:07:07.340
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit,</v>

8842
04:07:07.340 --> 04:07:08.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm in deep fucking trouble.</v>

8843
04:07:09.110 --> 04:07:10.940
<v Speaker 5>And he took him down and beat him up.</v>

8844
04:07:11.180 --> 04:07:16.100
<v Speaker 5>It was a brutal fight and an excellent example of how a 240 pound fighter,</v>

8845
04:07:16.440 --> 04:07:17.420
<v Speaker 5>it might be a better deal.</v>

8846
04:07:17.421 --> 04:07:18.440
<v Speaker 5>That's why I could do that.</v>

8847
04:07:18.450 --> 04:07:18.821
<v Speaker 5>Kingsville,</v>

8848
04:07:18.821 --> 04:07:19.760
<v Speaker 5>but that's a fighter.</v>

8849
04:07:19.900 --> 04:07:20.620
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

8850
04:07:20.620 --> 04:07:24.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean that could be a fighting style man versus man til it's also,</v>

8851
04:07:24.500 --> 04:07:25.520
<v Speaker 5>you have to put it up,</v>

8852
04:07:25.550 --> 04:07:26.480
<v Speaker 5>you have to put it up at Cain.</v>

8853
04:07:26.481 --> 04:07:29.430
<v Speaker 5>Velasquez has extraordinary cardio for heavyweight.</v>

8854
04:07:29.720 --> 04:07:33.800
<v Speaker 5>Cardio is one of the biggest weapons he has and if not the absolutely,</v>

8855
04:07:34.010 --> 04:07:35.060
<v Speaker 5>absolutely skill.</v>

8856
04:07:35.270 --> 04:07:37.850
<v Speaker 5>Great technique with striking and with wrestling,</v>

8857
04:07:38.900 --> 04:07:42.110
<v Speaker 5>but almost more importantly championship mindset,</v>

8858
04:07:42.350 --> 04:07:45.050
<v Speaker 5>like a hundred percent confidence in himself and cardio.</v>

8859
04:07:45.051 --> 04:07:47.990
<v Speaker 5>That's just like superhuman is a championship mindset.</v>

8860
04:07:48.020 --> 04:07:53.020
<v Speaker 5>He has the heart like no one else and then he has cardio is how fucking hard MMA</v>

8861
04:07:53.721 --> 04:07:54.020
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

8862
04:07:54.020 --> 04:07:55.430
<v Speaker 5>Even that guy lost.</v>

8863
04:07:55.460 --> 04:07:56.293
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

8864
04:07:56.330 --> 04:07:56.901
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that crazy?</v>

8865
04:07:56.901 --> 04:07:57.380
<v Speaker 5>Come on,</v>

8866
04:07:57.380 --> 04:07:58.213
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

8867
04:07:58.460 --> 04:08:03.460
<v Speaker 5>Even that guy can have a day where he just like when he fought over doom.</v>

8868
04:08:03.740 --> 04:08:04.573
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

8869
04:08:05.660 --> 04:08:06.380
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

8870
04:08:06.380 --> 04:08:09.170
<v Speaker 5>That's what I found is best guys have 10 losses.</v>

8871
04:08:09.200 --> 04:08:09.530
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

8872
04:08:09.530 --> 04:08:09.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

8873
04:08:09.890 --> 04:08:10.410
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

8874
04:08:10.410 --> 04:08:11.243
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

8875
04:08:11.360 --> 04:08:11.920
<v Speaker 5>Look man,</v>

8876
04:08:11.920 --> 04:08:12.860
<v Speaker 5>in my opinion,</v>

8877
04:08:12.920 --> 04:08:17.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean bef Kane is not done like his career is not done,</v>

8878
04:08:17.360 --> 04:08:18.530
<v Speaker 5>but when it all goes down,</v>

8879
04:08:18.680 --> 04:08:20.750
<v Speaker 5>you have to look at him in his prime and go that.</v>

8880
04:08:20.840 --> 04:08:24.620
<v Speaker 5>That is one of the very best examples of a heavyweight fighter we've ever seen.</v>

8881
04:08:25.230 --> 04:08:26.510
<v Speaker 5>I think he's top two.</v>

8882
04:08:26.511 --> 04:08:27.344
<v Speaker 5>If Tom,</v>

8883
04:08:28.040 --> 04:08:28.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm 100% with you,</v>

8884
04:08:28.941 --> 04:08:30.280
<v Speaker 5>I think on a personal one,</v>

8885
04:08:30.410 --> 04:08:31.980
<v Speaker 5>but it might because a door see,</v>

8886
04:08:32.010 --> 04:08:35.300
<v Speaker 5>well you could toss for doom in there without a good toss for doom in there,</v>

8887
04:08:35.330 --> 04:08:36.620
<v Speaker 5>but you could toss for doom and they're just so,</v>

8888
04:08:36.660 --> 04:08:38.540
<v Speaker 5>it was true on accomplishments on paper.</v>

8889
04:08:38.540 --> 04:08:39.560
<v Speaker 5>You have to look at if you're doing,</v>

8890
04:08:39.660 --> 04:08:40.280
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

8891
04:08:40.280 --> 04:08:43.880
<v Speaker 5>I think Kane most likely the obviously just my educated opinion,</v>

8892
04:08:44.030 --> 04:08:49.030
<v Speaker 5>I think he's the best matchup for four to beat Steve Bay with skill sets because</v>

8893
04:08:51.050 --> 04:08:53.240
<v Speaker 5>does doom and then he gets steep a,</v>

8894
04:08:53.241 --> 04:08:54.530
<v Speaker 5>it's a tough matchup for steep.</v>

8895
04:08:54.531 --> 04:08:55.430
<v Speaker 5>If you look down on paper,</v>

8896
04:08:55.460 --> 04:08:56.960
<v Speaker 5>if they fight the way he fought,</v>

8897
04:08:56.980 --> 04:08:57.170
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

8898
04:08:57.170 --> 04:08:57.441
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

8899
04:08:57.441 --> 04:08:58.100
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing,</v>

8900
04:08:58.100 --> 04:09:01.840
<v Speaker 5>they cane has been through some wars with junior wars.</v>

8901
04:09:01.860 --> 04:09:03.770
<v Speaker 5>Dbas been through war and steep,</v>

8902
04:09:03.780 --> 04:09:05.060
<v Speaker 5>it went through a war with junior.</v>

8903
04:09:05.061 --> 04:09:07.040
<v Speaker 5>But the difference between his teeth pays war with Jr.</v>

8904
04:09:07.041 --> 04:09:08.000
<v Speaker 5>And I know MMA,</v>

8905
04:09:08.001 --> 04:09:09.380
<v Speaker 5>math doesn't really work this way.</v>

8906
04:09:09.670 --> 04:09:12.530
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't like look at one guy and go just cause it's one guy beat one guy,</v>

8907
04:09:12.531 --> 04:09:13.364
<v Speaker 5>he's going to beat the other guy.</v>

8908
04:09:13.570 --> 04:09:14.430
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't work like that.</v>

8909
04:09:14.580 --> 04:09:18.780
<v Speaker 5>But if they fight in the same way that Steve Bay fought junior dos Santos,</v>

8910
04:09:18.781 --> 04:09:23.100
<v Speaker 5>you've got to think that cane can keep a pace that's ahead of where jds was</v>

8911
04:09:23.130 --> 04:09:25.350
<v Speaker 5>correct and take Steve Bay and him,</v>

8912
04:09:25.440 --> 04:09:29.310
<v Speaker 5>it was a very close fight between him and jds and it was like super close him</v>

8913
04:09:29.311 --> 04:09:32.640
<v Speaker 5>hitting that high level upper echelon of the heavyweight division for the first</v>

8914
04:09:32.641 --> 04:09:33.181
<v Speaker 5>time as well,</v>

8915
04:09:33.181 --> 04:09:34.230
<v Speaker 5>other than the strew fight.</v>

8916
04:09:34.800 --> 04:09:35.400
<v Speaker 5>So I think,</v>

8917
04:09:35.400 --> 04:09:36.091
<v Speaker 5>I don't know man.</v>

8918
04:09:36.091 --> 04:09:36.924
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>

8919
04:09:37.050 --> 04:09:39.860
<v Speaker 5>I think that Cain is a nightmare for anybody if he's healthy.</v>

8920
04:09:39.861 --> 04:09:43.410
<v Speaker 5>I just think if cane comes back and becomes champion and beat Steve Bay,</v>

8921
04:09:43.470 --> 04:09:47.010
<v Speaker 5>he's the best heavyweight of all time and there's a good probability he's going</v>

8922
04:09:47.011 --> 04:09:47.844
<v Speaker 5>to do that.</v>

8923
04:09:48.090 --> 04:09:48.923
<v Speaker 5>We're steep,</v>

8924
04:09:49.000 --> 04:09:49.271
<v Speaker 5>steep.</v>

8925
04:09:49.271 --> 04:09:49.950
<v Speaker 5>It's a nightmare.</v>

8926
04:09:49.950 --> 04:09:50.220
<v Speaker 5>But his,</v>

8927
04:09:50.220 --> 04:09:51.990
<v Speaker 5>that's box boxing but how,</v>

8928
04:09:52.060 --> 04:09:53.490
<v Speaker 5>how but what if he did MMA?</v>

8929
04:09:53.640 --> 04:09:54.361
<v Speaker 5>Oh boy.</v>

8930
04:09:54.361 --> 04:09:56.180
<v Speaker 5>He would get taken down smushed.</v>

8931
04:09:56.770 --> 04:09:57.840
<v Speaker 5>You'd get fucked up.</v>

8932
04:09:58.080 --> 04:09:59.940
<v Speaker 5>He get taken down and smashed through two.</v>

8933
04:09:59.941 --> 04:10:00.960
<v Speaker 5>Don't have know how to wrestle.</v>

8934
04:10:00.961 --> 04:10:03.420
<v Speaker 5>You can't start at 35 and compete at that level.</v>

8935
04:10:03.421 --> 04:10:03.721
<v Speaker 5>You just,</v>

8936
04:10:03.721 --> 04:10:04.140
<v Speaker 5>you're not,</v>

8937
04:10:04.140 --> 04:10:05.850
<v Speaker 5>if you don't actually know something.</v>

8938
04:10:06.300 --> 04:10:11.300
<v Speaker 5>If a guy knows something and Anthony Boxes Klitschko Andrew Johns,</v>

8939
04:10:12.130 --> 04:10:13.740
<v Speaker 5>Joshua [inaudible] not the tall,</v>

8940
04:10:13.741 --> 04:10:17.100
<v Speaker 5>those guys would would get destroyed and if not,</v>

8941
04:10:17.310 --> 04:10:21.240
<v Speaker 5>they started in them and man fucked up by a lot of high level right now.</v>

8942
04:10:21.240 --> 04:10:22.170
<v Speaker 5>They decided to do it.</v>

8943
04:10:22.500 --> 04:10:24.380
<v Speaker 5>Do they get fucked up by Rico Verhoeven?</v>

8944
04:10:24.390 --> 04:10:24.690
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

8945
04:10:24.690 --> 04:10:25.710
<v Speaker 5>forget about MMA.</v>

8946
04:10:25.890 --> 04:10:27.720
<v Speaker 5>Just kickboxers a like Rico.</v>

8947
04:10:27.721 --> 04:10:30.930
<v Speaker 5>Verhoeven will fuck up a lot of boxes and touch him.</v>

8948
04:10:30.960 --> 04:10:33.540
<v Speaker 5>He wouldn't give me away way on the outside.</v>

8949
04:10:34.310 --> 04:10:36.450
<v Speaker 5>More prepared for MMA than boxers know.</v>

8950
04:10:36.451 --> 04:10:38.520
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying is that boxers right now,</v>

8951
04:10:38.550 --> 04:10:43.150
<v Speaker 5>like them getting into MMA is they can't even get through the top kickboxers is</v>

8952
04:10:43.151 --> 04:10:43.591
<v Speaker 5>what I'm saying.</v>

8953
04:10:43.591 --> 04:10:47.690
<v Speaker 5>So kickboxing is kick the top kickboxers are more prepared to go into MMA and</v>

8954
04:10:47.691 --> 04:10:50.430
<v Speaker 5>not necessarily guys get taken down.</v>

8955
04:10:50.450 --> 04:10:50.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

8956
04:10:50.670 --> 04:10:51.780
<v Speaker 5>Everybody gets taken down.</v>

8957
04:10:51.810 --> 04:10:52.860
<v Speaker 5>So when they get taken down,</v>

8958
04:10:52.861 --> 04:10:55.230
<v Speaker 5>you know as well as anybody does when they're fucked,</v>

8959
04:10:55.290 --> 04:10:56.123
<v Speaker 5>they're all fun.</v>

8960
04:10:56.190 --> 04:10:57.690
<v Speaker 5>The difference between the boxing,</v>

8961
04:10:57.691 --> 04:10:58.950
<v Speaker 5>like the best boxers,</v>

8962
04:10:58.951 --> 04:11:00.360
<v Speaker 5>they're hands are without a doubt.</v>

8963
04:11:00.361 --> 04:11:01.960
<v Speaker 5>Better than the best kick boxers.</v>

8964
04:11:02.030 --> 04:11:02.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

8965
04:11:02.280 --> 04:11:06.240
<v Speaker 5>But they don't have to be that good with their hands because they got all these</v>

8966
04:11:06.241 --> 04:11:07.074
<v Speaker 5>other tools.</v>

8967
04:11:07.110 --> 04:11:11.730
<v Speaker 5>So they might have one skill that's like maybe I would say like the Max of the</v>

8968
04:11:11.731 --> 04:11:13.050
<v Speaker 5>best kick boxers,</v>

8969
04:11:13.051 --> 04:11:16.200
<v Speaker 5>like 70% of the hands of a world championship boxer.</v>

8970
04:11:16.410 --> 04:11:16.880
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

8971
04:11:16.880 --> 04:11:17.910
<v Speaker 5>If you want to look at it like a flow,</v>

8972
04:11:17.940 --> 04:11:22.230
<v Speaker 5>like a Roberto Duran and is proud where the fuck punches like that in MMA,</v>

8973
04:11:22.260 --> 04:11:23.093
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

8974
04:11:23.130 --> 04:11:23.963
<v Speaker 5>No one wait.</v>

8975
04:11:24.050 --> 04:11:24.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

8976
04:11:24.370 --> 04:11:24.990
<v Speaker 5>Kickboxing.</v>

8977
04:11:24.990 --> 04:11:25.470
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

8978
04:11:25.470 --> 04:11:26.600
<v Speaker 5>Say this again you guys.</v>

8979
04:11:27.010 --> 04:11:27.510
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

8980
04:11:27.510 --> 04:11:27.840
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

8981
04:11:27.840 --> 04:11:28.101
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

8982
04:11:28.101 --> 04:11:28.281
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

8983
04:11:28.281 --> 04:11:28.571
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

8984
04:11:28.571 --> 04:11:29.404
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>

8985
04:11:30.160 --> 04:11:31.380
<v Speaker 5>Maybe the guys maybe.</v>

8986
04:11:31.620 --> 04:11:32.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you can get there.</v>

8987
04:11:32.911 --> 04:11:33.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you can get there.</v>

8988
04:11:33.961 --> 04:11:36.420
<v Speaker 5>I think to maybe you got a sugar ray Leonard as good as rot.</v>

8989
04:11:36.430 --> 04:11:37.263
<v Speaker 5>Roberta dress,</v>

8990
04:11:39.010 --> 04:11:40.320
<v Speaker 5>he gets to do knees,</v>

8991
04:11:40.470 --> 04:11:41.303
<v Speaker 5>elbows,</v>

8992
04:11:41.440 --> 04:11:42.273
<v Speaker 5>takedowns.</v>

8993
04:11:42.980 --> 04:11:43.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

8994
04:11:43.290 --> 04:11:43.531
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

8995
04:11:43.531 --> 04:11:47.040
<v Speaker 5>Robbie Lawler was a fucking savage and I would never compare him unfavorably to</v>

8996
04:11:47.041 --> 04:11:48.690
<v Speaker 5>anybody because he's like one of my all time.</v>

8997
04:11:48.691 --> 04:11:48.971
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

8998
04:11:48.971 --> 04:11:53.520
<v Speaker 5>Yours just as good as fucking focused on boxing solely.</v>

8999
04:11:53.670 --> 04:11:56.820
<v Speaker 5>If he focused on boxing solely or plot right now,</v>

9000
04:11:56.880 --> 04:11:59.990
<v Speaker 5>fuck in his prime sugar ray Leonard and boxing.</v>

9001
04:12:00.050 --> 04:12:00.611
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

9159
04:16:30.270 --> 04:16:30.740
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

9160
04:16:30.740 --> 04:16:32.520
<v Speaker 6>I had this guy on the show call.</v>

9161
04:16:32.521 --> 04:16:33.830
<v Speaker 6>His name is Peter Cortez.</v>

9162
04:16:34.130 --> 04:16:35.600
<v Speaker 6>He's a professor,</v>

9163
04:16:35.601 --> 04:16:37.340
<v Speaker 6>I think at the university.</v>

9164
04:16:37.341 --> 04:16:38.174
<v Speaker 6>Houston.</v>

9165
04:16:38.330 --> 04:16:38.840
<v Speaker 6>Really,</v>

9166
04:16:38.840 --> 04:16:39.890
<v Speaker 6>really smart dude.</v>

9167
04:16:39.891 --> 04:16:40.310
<v Speaker 6>But his,</v>

9168
04:16:40.310 --> 04:16:45.310
<v Speaker 6>his specialty is infectious diseases in tropical climates.</v>

9169
04:16:46.310 --> 04:16:48.410
<v Speaker 6>Like parasites go on your deck.</v>

9170
04:16:48.500 --> 04:16:48.771
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

9171
04:16:48.771 --> 04:16:49.320
<v Speaker 6>All,</v>

9172
04:16:49.320 --> 04:16:49.650
<v Speaker 6>all,</v>

9173
04:16:49.650 --> 04:16:49.960
<v Speaker 6>all,</v>

9174
04:16:49.960 --> 04:16:51.830
<v Speaker 6>all form of different parasites.</v>

9175
04:16:52.220 --> 04:16:53.810
<v Speaker 6>But this was what was really crazy.</v>

9176
04:16:54.050 --> 04:16:59.050
<v Speaker 6>He was saying that somewhere in like the high 90% of all people in these</v>

9177
04:16:59.811 --> 04:17:01.100
<v Speaker 6>tropical climates,</v>

9178
04:17:01.310 --> 04:17:02.870
<v Speaker 6>I hope I'm not misquoting him.</v>

9179
04:17:03.230 --> 04:17:05.900
<v Speaker 6>They have some sort of infections.</v>

9180
04:17:06.290 --> 04:17:08.360
<v Speaker 6>They have some sort of parasites living in them.</v>

9181
04:17:09.260 --> 04:17:10.093
<v Speaker 6>My jungle.</v>

9182
04:17:10.130 --> 04:17:10.670
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

9183
04:17:10.670 --> 04:17:12.230
<v Speaker 6>that seems totally straight.</v>

9184
04:17:12.231 --> 04:17:14.270
<v Speaker 6>They go on those lagoons there covering the,</v>

9185
04:17:14.750 --> 04:17:16.730
<v Speaker 6>not even that Dick,</v>

9186
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:18.850
<v Speaker 6>if that's a the food you're eating,</v>

9187
04:17:18.851 --> 04:17:19.170
<v Speaker 6>owning your,</v>

9188
04:17:19.170 --> 04:17:22.220
<v Speaker 6>but it's in like we're talking about Lyme disease.</v>

9189
04:17:22.221 --> 04:17:23.480
<v Speaker 6>That's kind of a disease.</v>

9190
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:26.490
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's like it kind of a of a virus or a bacteria.</v>

9191
04:17:26.510 --> 04:17:29.630
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how you would describe viruses from all the traveling.</v>

9192
04:17:30.050 --> 04:17:30.883
<v Speaker 6>No ticks.</v>

9193
04:17:31.730 --> 04:17:32.151
<v Speaker 6>Ticks.</v>

9194
04:17:32.151 --> 04:17:32.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

9195
04:17:32.890 --> 04:17:33.620
<v Speaker 6>What do you do with that?</v>

9196
04:17:33.620 --> 04:17:34.453
<v Speaker 6>How do you deal with that?</v>

9197
04:17:35.140 --> 04:17:38.030
<v Speaker 6>I've been bitten by a few ticks and they bury in.</v>

9198
04:17:38.720 --> 04:17:43.250
<v Speaker 6>So I would take like a trying to think what either knee,</v>

9199
04:17:43.251 --> 04:17:47.570
<v Speaker 6>I think I heat it up and needle and stuck a tick and when they burn they back</v>

9200
04:17:47.571 --> 04:17:48.080
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>

9201
04:17:48.080 --> 04:17:48.913
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

9202
04:17:49.790 --> 04:17:50.601
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

9203
04:17:50.601 --> 04:17:51.440
<v Speaker 6>I've been once then,</v>

9204
04:17:51.441 --> 04:17:52.190
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

9205
04:17:52.190 --> 04:17:52.431
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

9206
04:17:52.431 --> 04:17:53.121
<v Speaker 6>a few times.</v>

9207
04:17:53.121 --> 04:17:53.730
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>

9208
04:17:53.730 --> 04:17:55.670
<v Speaker 6>the ticks because I dunno what happens,</v>

9209
04:17:55.671 --> 04:17:57.290
<v Speaker 6>but you can't feel them going in.</v>

9210
04:17:57.291 --> 04:17:59.720
<v Speaker 6>All of a sudden you kind of the saliva.</v>

9211
04:17:59.721 --> 04:18:00.500
<v Speaker 6>That's a numbing,</v>

9212
04:18:00.500 --> 04:18:00.920
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

9213
04:18:00.920 --> 04:18:04.040
<v Speaker 6>so it must be something you think you'd feel them bearing in your skin,</v>

9214
04:18:04.041 --> 04:18:06.710
<v Speaker 6>but you don't feel them till their end and then you double check that.</v>

9215
04:18:06.711 --> 04:18:07.544
<v Speaker 6>Jamie,</v>

9216
04:18:11.520 --> 04:18:16.520
<v Speaker 6>has anybody ever had one of those ticks bury themselves in the rectum?</v>

9217
04:18:17.400 --> 04:18:17.581
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

9218
04:18:17.581 --> 04:18:18.660
<v Speaker 6>deepen the bottle there.</v>

9219
04:18:18.661 --> 04:18:21.980
<v Speaker 6>They go towards the dark out when you stop,</v>

9220
04:18:21.990 --> 04:18:23.970
<v Speaker 6>like you know what is that when you go vegan?</v>

9221
04:18:24.650 --> 04:18:25.111
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

9222
04:18:25.111 --> 04:18:26.960
<v Speaker 6>It's it crawls inside your butthole.</v>

9223
04:18:27.170 --> 04:18:28.680
<v Speaker 6>I just flush out APP.</v>

9224
04:18:28.880 --> 04:18:29.701
<v Speaker 6>It just keeps you out of it.</v>

9225
04:18:29.701 --> 04:18:32.220
<v Speaker 6>How many times does that have to happen before you just say,</v>

9226
04:18:33.180 --> 04:18:34.020
<v Speaker 6>I want to go to boulder.</v>

9227
04:18:34.980 --> 04:18:35.540
<v Speaker 6>I haven't had,</v>

9228
04:18:35.540 --> 04:18:37.080
<v Speaker 6>I haven't had the belly,</v>

9229
04:18:37.081 --> 04:18:39.090
<v Speaker 6>but it's actually the softball size.</v>

9230
04:18:39.090 --> 04:18:41.130
<v Speaker 6>Tick their lives in gas now.</v>

9231
04:18:41.131 --> 04:18:42.040
<v Speaker 6>Ticks or cast.</v>

9234
04:18:43.711 --> 04:18:45.250

<v Speaker 6>That's the thing about the world.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Tick a knows your ass and make different bugs or just jacking each other.</v>

9267
04:19:28.040 --> 04:19:30.480
<v Speaker 6>The problem is attracted to the smell of shit that it's,</v>

9268
04:19:30.660 --> 04:19:31.860
<v Speaker 6>if you don't wipe her ass right,</v>

9269
04:19:31.890 --> 04:19:32.221
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

9270
04:19:32.221 --> 04:19:32.461
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

9271
04:19:32.461 --> 04:19:33.450
<v Speaker 6>you're susceptible.</v>

9272
04:19:33.620 --> 04:19:34.453
<v Speaker 6>Probably</v>

9273
04:19:36.040 --> 04:19:36.540
<v Speaker 6>Browse.</v>

9274
04:19:36.540 --> 04:19:37.740
<v Speaker 6>Right dude.</v>

9275
04:19:37.770 --> 04:19:38.550
<v Speaker 6>Expect it.</v>

9276
04:19:38.550 --> 04:19:39.510
<v Speaker 6>Don't be surprised.</v>

9277
04:19:39.920 --> 04:19:40.280
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

9278
04:19:40.280 --> 04:19:41.113
<v Speaker 6>think about it.</v>

9279
04:19:41.190 --> 04:19:45.360
<v Speaker 6>Is that a wives tale that bear are attracted to ministration?</v>

9280
04:19:45.780 --> 04:19:47.790
<v Speaker 6>I don't know cause I've heard that.</v>

9281
04:19:47.820 --> 04:19:51.300
<v Speaker 6>I believe I've heard that 100% assumed that,</v>

9282
04:19:51.301 --> 04:19:53.610
<v Speaker 6>but I would think that people would be afraid to say it because they don't want</v>

9283
04:19:53.611 --> 04:19:57.210
<v Speaker 6>to accuse women of being like in any way,</v>

9284
04:19:57.211 --> 04:20:00.300
<v Speaker 6>like bringing on the bears or,</v>

9285
04:20:00.301 --> 04:20:01.790
<v Speaker 6>and they don't want to address.</v>

9286
04:20:01.930 --> 04:20:03.090
<v Speaker 6>I find out that's true.</v>

9287
04:20:03.240 --> 04:20:04.380
<v Speaker 6>Bears not attracted,</v>

9288
04:20:04.381 --> 04:20:04.621
<v Speaker 6>says,</v>

9289
04:20:04.621 --> 04:20:04.950

<v Speaker 6>smell it.</v>

9292
04:20:07.210 --> 04:20:11.930
<v Speaker 6>We're not attracted polar bear guards,</v>

9293
04:20:13.090 --> 04:20:15.510
<v Speaker 6>but polar Stockholm.</v>

9294
04:20:15.511 --> 04:20:16.560
<v Speaker 6>I believe it though.</v>

9295
04:20:16.660 --> 04:20:19.780
<v Speaker 6>But it says polar bears may be interested in the smell of menstrual blood.</v>

9296
04:20:21.810 --> 04:20:26.100
<v Speaker 6>They've eaten about a hundred researchers with China's meanwhile.</v>

04:20:27.940 --> 04:20:28.910
<v Speaker 6>this is the cover up.</v>

04:20:29.470 --> 04:20:30.360
<v Speaker 6>They bought the song.</v>

9302
04:20:30.480 --> 04:20:30.931
<v Speaker 6>Meanwhile,</v>

<v Speaker 6>They didn't tell him about the menstruation.</v>

9309

<v Speaker 6>That's some strong shit.</v>

9310
04:20:44.910 --> 04:20:48.840
<v Speaker 6>That's what's really scary about the way some animals kill other animals as</v>

9311
04:20:48.841 --> 04:20:49.200

9323
04:21:06.010 --> 04:21:09.490
<v Speaker 5>my listening and the study designed to test the hypothesis that bears are</v>

9324
04:21:09.491 --> 04:21:09.971
<v Speaker 5>attracted.</v>

9325
04:21:09.971 --> 04:21:11.260
<v Speaker 5>The odors of menstruation,</v>

9326
04:21:11.610 --> 04:21:11.831
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

9327
04:21:11.831 --> 04:21:15.700
<v Speaker 5>Cushing reported that when presented with a series of different odors including</v>

9328
04:21:15.701 --> 04:21:16.091
<v Speaker 5>seals,</v>

9329
04:21:16.091 --> 04:21:16.841
<v Speaker 5>sense and other,</v>

9330

<v Speaker 5>That was the end of why</v>

9334
04:21:28.170 --> 04:21:28.930
<v Speaker 5>he had to,</v>

9335
04:21:28.930 --> 04:21:29.763
<v Speaker 5>when I was,</v>

9336
04:21:30.260 --> 04:21:31.093
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

04:21:31.660 --> 04:21:32.493
<v Speaker 5>I didn't finish it,</v>

9338
04:21:32.860 --> 04:21:33.880
<v Speaker 5>that I finished.</v>

9339
04:21:34.930 --> 04:21:38.380
<v Speaker 5>Four captains elicited a PR.</v>

9340
04:21:38.410 --> 04:21:39.760
<v Speaker 5>That party didn't get elicited.</v>

9341
04:21:39.761 --> 04:21:40.570
<v Speaker 5>The what?</v>

9342
04:21:40.570 --> 04:21:41.410
<v Speaker 5>This is good news.</v>

04:21:41.490 --> 04:21:42.520
<v Speaker 5>Now what does it say?</v>

9344
04:21:42.730 --> 04:21:45.300
<v Speaker 5>You're going to go on for bears and then you could show it.</v>

9345
04:21:45.310 --> 04:21:47.530
<v Speaker 5>You could tell your wife said that these links and say,</v>

9346
04:21:47.531 --> 04:21:48.364
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

9347
04:21:48.370 --> 04:21:49.240
<v Speaker 5>they go after periods.</v>

9348
04:21:49.241 --> 04:21:50.074
<v Speaker 5>We have to stop that.</v>

9349
04:21:50.320 --> 04:21:51.700
<v Speaker 5>I can't bring you.</v>

9350
04:21:52.270 --> 04:21:53.880
<v Speaker 5>I do want to bring you on this bear</v>

9351
04:21:55.460 --> 04:21:56.293
<v Speaker 5>desires.</v>

9352
04:21:56.940 --> 04:21:58.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm concerned for your safety.</v>

9353
04:21:59.020 --> 04:22:00.490
<v Speaker 5>Don't you start your rag mix.</v>

9354
04:22:01.270 --> 04:22:01.481
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

9355
04:22:01.481 --> 04:22:02.290
<v Speaker 5>think about that.</v>

9356
04:22:02.290 --> 04:22:03.070
<v Speaker 5>Look at ways website.</v>

9357
04:22:03.070 --> 04:22:03.640
<v Speaker 5>Hold on a second.</v>

9358
04:22:03.640 --> 04:22:04.473
<v Speaker 5>Your links.</v>

9359
04:22:05.680 --> 04:22:06.341
<v Speaker 5>I can't see it.</v>

9360
04:22:06.341 --> 04:22:06.611
<v Speaker 5>Jamie.</v>

9361
04:22:06.611 --> 04:22:07.211
<v Speaker 5>That camera.</v>

9362
04:22:07.211 --> 04:22:08.560
<v Speaker 5>You got the camera set up there.</v>

9363
04:22:11.200 --> 04:22:11.710
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

9364
04:22:11.710 --> 04:22:12.510
<v Speaker 5>that's good.</v>

9365
04:22:12.510 --> 04:22:16.570
<v Speaker 5>A strong behavioral response only to seal sense and menstrual odors.</v>

9366
04:22:16.600 --> 04:22:17.433
<v Speaker 5>Use tampons.</v>

9367
04:22:17.440 --> 04:22:17.861
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

9368
04:22:17.861 --> 04:22:18.700
<v Speaker 5>so it did.</v>

9369
04:22:19.630 --> 04:22:20.770
<v Speaker 5>So that's not true.</v>

9370
04:22:21.220 --> 04:22:22.300
<v Speaker 5>Those for polar bears.</v>

9371
04:22:23.080 --> 04:22:24.550
<v Speaker 5>For polar bears,</v>

9372
04:22:24.551 --> 04:22:25.490
<v Speaker 5>it's an attractive,</v>

9373
04:22:25.491 --> 04:22:25.960
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

9374
04:22:25.960 --> 04:22:30.070
<v Speaker 5>I got to think that is where it's going to smell it to any of that</v>

9375
04:22:31.660 --> 04:22:32.440
<v Speaker 5>other stuff.</v>

9376
04:22:32.440 --> 04:22:34.150
<v Speaker 5>There's probably other stuff they prefer.</v>

9377
04:22:34.420 --> 04:22:35.171
<v Speaker 5>All you got to say,</v>

9378
04:22:35.171 --> 04:22:36.004

04:22:48.460 --> 04:22:48.701
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

9393
04:22:48.701 --> 04:22:49.630
<v Speaker 5>We sought mountain lions.</v>

9394
04:22:49.870 --> 04:22:50.310
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

9395
04:22:50.310 --> 04:22:50.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

9396
04:22:50.500 --> 04:22:53.410
<v Speaker 5>Was telling Mama and how many cubs should have two or three bobcats.</v>

9397
04:22:53.440 --> 04:22:53.921
<v Speaker 5>Bobcats.</v>

9398
04:22:53.921 --> 04:22:55.280
<v Speaker 5>Did you attempt to cross paths?</v>

9399
04:22:55.290 --> 04:22:55.690
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

9400
04:22:55.690 --> 04:22:56.780
<v Speaker 5>We saw a a,</v>

04:22:58.031 --> 04:22:58.810
<v Speaker 5>Two kittens.</v>

9404
04:22:58.810 --> 04:22:59.770
<v Speaker 5>If you saw a female,</v>

9405
04:22:59.771 --> 04:23:01.930
<v Speaker 5>might be worried at all the other smaller Catholics.</v>

9406
04:23:03.370 --> 04:23:04.600
<v Speaker 5>I think that one of them was,</v>

9407
04:23:04.601 --> 04:23:04.931
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Why was I needed in my mind?</v>

9410
04:23:09.700 --> 04:23:10.930
<v Speaker 5>I saw it so quick.</v>

9411
04:23:11.080 --> 04:23:14.020
<v Speaker 5>This is a shitty memory is or you're higher in my mind.</v>

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

9413
04:23:14.440 --> 04:23:14.801
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

04:23:18.161 --> 04:23:19.080
<v Speaker 5>not too long.</v>

9420
04:23:19.770 --> 04:23:20.650
<v Speaker 5>He thought it was a mountain lion.</v>

9421
04:23:20.910 --> 04:23:21.743
<v Speaker 5>No dog.</v>

9422
04:23:21.760 --> 04:23:21.911
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

9423
04:23:21.911 --> 04:23:22.540
<v Speaker 5>I didn't bring anything.</v>

9424
04:23:22.540 --> 04:23:22.981
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

9425
04:23:22.981 --> 04:23:23.620

9430
04:23:28.770 --> 04:23:28.961
<v Speaker 5>Heady.</v>

9431
04:23:28.961 --> 04:23:29.590
<v Speaker 5>Hold on a second.</v>

9432
04:23:29.590 --> 04:23:30.700
<v Speaker 5>I thought those things were,</v>

9433
04:23:30.730 --> 04:23:32.590
<v Speaker 5>I thought those things were a cougars.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Now the big Bobcat,</v>

9435
04:23:34.360 --> 04:23:36.400
<v Speaker 5>how you can tell like quickly as the tail,</v>

9436
04:23:36.430 --> 04:23:37.420
<v Speaker 5>they were really small.</v>

9437
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.721
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

9438
04:23:37.721 --> 04:23:38.291
<v Speaker 5>they're small.</v>

9439
04:23:38.291 --> 04:23:39.610
<v Speaker 5>But a mountain lion.</v>

9440
04:23:39.611 --> 04:23:42.460
<v Speaker 5>You're always going to notice a tail long tail man.</v>

9441
04:23:42.461 --> 04:23:44.530
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting cause it was such a brief thing.</v>

9442
04:23:44.560 --> 04:23:49.560
<v Speaker 5>You guys said it first and then I turned and saw him for such a maybe half a</v>

9443
04:23:50.201 --> 04:23:51.910
<v Speaker 5>second wait a second before they bolted.</v>

9444
04:23:52.090 --> 04:23:56.500
<v Speaker 5>And I'm thinking that sometimes when you expect to see something like,</v>

9445
04:23:56.501 --> 04:24:01.000
<v Speaker 5>so I think maybe Brian had said cat and maybe I thought Cougar.</v>

9446
04:24:01.050 --> 04:24:01.401
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

9447
04:24:01.401 --> 04:24:03.680
<v Speaker 5>so maybe it was just a flash in my mind.</v>

9448
04:24:03.681 --> 04:24:05.030
<v Speaker 5>Filled in the blanks.</v>

9449
04:24:05.060 --> 04:24:05.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

9450
04:24:05.720 --> 04:24:06.710
<v Speaker 5>Which is shocking.</v>

9451
04:24:06.740 --> 04:24:08.220
<v Speaker 5>That happens with shots.</v>

9452
04:24:08.490 --> 04:24:11.450
<v Speaker 5>Most dangerous cat and this part of the world.</v>

9453
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:13.700
<v Speaker 5>Mal mine more than a bobcat.</v>

9454
04:24:14.240 --> 04:24:14.540

9459
04:24:20.600 --> 04:24:22.700
<v Speaker 5>Once you realize you're being stocked,</v>

9460
04:24:22.701 --> 04:24:24.260
<v Speaker 5>is there a point you want to watch a video?</v>

9461
04:24:24.350 --> 04:24:26.650
<v Speaker 5>Usually you don't realize it.</v>

9462
04:24:26.870 --> 04:24:29.210
<v Speaker 5>They realize you're being stocked at that point.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Keeps coming close to him.</v>

9483
04:25:01.580 --> 04:25:02.001
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>

9484
04:25:02.001 --> 04:25:02.960
<v Speaker 5>So we can give the dude,</v>

9485
04:25:02.980 --> 04:25:03.350

9487
04:25:05.570 --> 04:25:07.670
<v Speaker 5>It says mountain lion standoff with hiker.</v>

9488
04:25:07.790 --> 04:25:08.330
<v Speaker 5>So this,</v>

9489
04:25:08.330 --> 04:25:09.051

04:25:09.051 --> 04:25:09.771
<v Speaker 5>whoever he was,</v>

9491
04:25:09.771 --> 04:25:10.604
<v Speaker 5>it was the hiker.</v>

9492
04:25:10.850 --> 04:25:15.560
<v Speaker 5>He was yelling here and the cat just keeps getting closer and closer to him and</v>

9493
04:25:15.561 --> 04:25:18.500
<v Speaker 5>he got fucking super sure to take off.</v>

04:25:22.161 --> 04:25:23.300
<v Speaker 5>Thinking about eating him.</v>

9497
04:25:24.380 --> 04:25:25.250
<v Speaker 5>Did he have a gun?</v>

9498
04:25:25.610 --> 04:25:26.660
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he did.</v>

9499
04:25:26.720 --> 04:25:27.700
<v Speaker 5>He just got loud.</v>

9500
04:25:27.860 --> 04:25:28.693
<v Speaker 5>Was it the time?</v>

9501
04:25:29.060 --> 04:25:29.893
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

9502
04:25:29.900 --> 04:25:30.640

9506
04:25:37.870 --> 04:25:38.201

9507
04:25:38.201 --> 04:25:39.910
<v Speaker 5>Where's glacier national park and he said,</v>

04:25:39.911 --> 04:25:40.744
<v Speaker 5>hey bud.</v>

9509

9511
04:25:45.311 --> 04:25:45.671
<v Speaker 5>And we said,</v>

04:25:45.671 --> 04:25:46.240
<v Speaker 5>hey buy,</v>

9513
04:25:46.240 --> 04:25:48.490
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they have a lot of mountain lions in Alaska.</v>

9514
04:25:48.670 --> 04:25:48.971
<v Speaker 5>Do they?</v>

9515
04:25:48.971 --> 04:25:50.380
<v Speaker 5>Cam Glacier.</v>

9516
04:25:50.410 --> 04:25:51.720
<v Speaker 5>That's a big little fucker.</v>

9517
04:25:51.721 --> 04:25:52.570
<v Speaker 5>That mother Fucker,</v>

9518
04:25:52.571 --> 04:25:54.340
<v Speaker 5>that's how fucking tiger right there.</v>

9519
04:25:54.341 --> 04:25:54.561
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

9520
04:25:54.561 --> 04:25:55.600
<v Speaker 5>That is so scary.</v>

9521
04:25:55.601 --> 04:26:00.601
<v Speaker 5>That cat that no rules have in motherfucker is closing in just an optical</v>

9522
04:26:02.441 --> 04:26:02.760
<v Speaker 5>illusion.</v>

9523
04:26:02.760 --> 04:26:05.890
<v Speaker 5>Terrible way to die on an optical illusion.</v>

9524
04:26:05.891 --> 04:26:06.071
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

9525
04:26:06.071 --> 04:26:07.330
<v Speaker 5>a hundred pound cat.</v>

9526
04:26:07.331 --> 04:26:08.620
<v Speaker 5>Like if you see a German shepherd,</v>

9527
04:26:08.800 --> 04:26:10.000
<v Speaker 5>German shepherd wants to fuck you up.</v>

9528
04:26:10.001 --> 04:26:10.451
<v Speaker 5>You're scared.</v>

9529
04:26:10.451 --> 04:26:10.780
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

9530
04:26:10.780 --> 04:26:12.490
<v Speaker 5>German shepard might weigh 70 pounds.</v>

9531
04:26:12.910 --> 04:26:13.151
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

9532
04:26:13.151 --> 04:26:14.500
<v Speaker 5>That's not a big animal at all,</v>

9533
04:26:14.650 --> 04:26:16.960
<v Speaker 5>but yet they will most likely fuck you up.</v>

9534
04:26:17.030 --> 04:26:17.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

9535
04:26:17.400 --> 04:26:20.470
<v Speaker 5>he all those belts and Malcolm was that they use for the police academy.</v>

9536
04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:24.010
<v Speaker 5>Think that those are actually like more likely to be in the 60s and 70 lbs.</v>

9537
04:26:24.340 --> 04:26:25.850
<v Speaker 5>German shepherds can get a little bit bigger.</v>

9538
04:26:26.760 --> 04:26:26.950
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

9539
04:26:26.950 --> 04:26:27.101
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

9540
04:26:27.101 --> 04:26:27.491
<v Speaker 5>he's not.</v>

9541
04:26:27.491 --> 04:26:28.510
<v Speaker 5>He just doesn't know what to do.</v>

9542
04:26:28.930 --> 04:26:29.830
<v Speaker 5>So he's making this video,</v>

9543
04:26:29.831 --> 04:26:31.000
<v Speaker 5>this guy shit in his pants.</v>

9544
04:26:31.060 --> 04:26:31.893
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

9545
04:26:33.080 --> 04:26:33.913
<v Speaker 7>that was awesome.</v>

9546
04:26:35.320 --> 04:26:36.153
<v Speaker 5>That was awesome.</v>

9547
04:26:37.840 --> 04:26:40.720
<v Speaker 5>There's a gang of those videos and occasionally,</v>

9548
04:26:40.960 --> 04:26:42.750
<v Speaker 5>occasionally people go missing.</v>

9549
04:26:42.790 --> 04:26:44.440
<v Speaker 5>They just grabbed her women and children though.</v>

9550
04:26:44.830 --> 04:26:45.521
<v Speaker 5>Not that guy.</v>

9551
04:26:45.521 --> 04:26:49.150
<v Speaker 5>That guy was a man and that might've kept him from being killed.</v>

9552
04:26:49.151 --> 04:26:50.320
<v Speaker 5>Maybe if that was a child,</v>

9553
04:26:50.560 --> 04:26:51.700
<v Speaker 5>the cat wouldn't have hesitated.</v>

9554
04:26:51.810 --> 04:26:52.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

9555
04:26:52.140 --> 04:26:52.270
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

9556
04:26:52.270 --> 04:26:52.461
<v Speaker 5>What did,</v>

9557
04:26:52.461 --> 04:26:54.250
<v Speaker 5>he just killed them and it's happened.</v>

9558
04:26:54.310 --> 04:26:54.581
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

9559
04:26:54.581 --> 04:26:58.090
<v Speaker 5>there was a guy in Cupertino who watched his kid get attacked by a mountain lion</v>

9560
04:26:58.091 --> 04:27:00.200
<v Speaker 5>just a year and a half ago and killed Tina was,</v>

9561
04:27:00.490 --> 04:27:01.950
<v Speaker 5>they chased it off</v>

9562
04:27:02.160 --> 04:27:04.410
<v Speaker 6>and I think then the animal skinny.</v>

9563
04:27:04.660 --> 04:27:04.951
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

9564
04:27:04.951 --> 04:27:05.780
<v Speaker 6>look at their thing.</v>

9565
04:27:05.780 --> 04:27:06.710
<v Speaker 6>That star.</v>

9566
04:27:07.020 --> 04:27:08.070
<v Speaker 6>Look at that right arm.</v>

9567
04:27:08.550 --> 04:27:09.540
<v Speaker 6>She's checked.</v>

9568
04:27:09.600 --> 04:27:09.780
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

9569
04:27:09.780 --> 04:27:13.470
<v Speaker 6>so you'd have the most ridiculous reco Roman skills.</v>

9570
04:27:14.460 --> 04:27:17.760
<v Speaker 6>You're going to go take a walk in the woods during your mother fucking rive.</v>

9571
04:27:17.770 --> 04:27:18.603
<v Speaker 6>How skinny.</v>

9572
04:27:19.110 --> 04:27:19.943
<v Speaker 6>Starving.</v>

9573
04:27:19.950 --> 04:27:21.120
<v Speaker 6>So then he's dangerous.</v>

9574
04:27:21.121 --> 04:27:21.601
<v Speaker 6>Look at it,</v>

9575
04:27:21.601 --> 04:27:21.980
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

9576
04:27:21.980 --> 04:27:22.813
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

9577
04:27:23.110 --> 04:27:24.550
<v Speaker 6>They're straight up killers.</v>

9578
04:27:25.010 --> 04:27:25.480
<v Speaker 6>Ooh,</v>

04:27:25.480 --> 04:27:26.313
<v Speaker 6>look at that.</v>

9580
04:27:26.370 --> 04:27:29.100
<v Speaker 6>That is so dangerous and it's just,</v>

9581
04:27:29.190 --> 04:27:31.200
<v Speaker 6>it's just not sure whether or not you got to bang stick.</v>

9582
04:27:31.500 --> 04:27:31.841
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

9583
04:27:31.841 --> 04:27:35.840
<v Speaker 6>you think about how the banks that gun think about trying to hold down a house</v>

9584
04:27:35.910 --> 04:27:36.690
<v Speaker 6>house cat.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Those things are scary.</v>

9589
04:27:45.030 --> 04:27:48.480
<v Speaker 6>What's really weird is that we love them and we want them around us,</v>

9590
04:27:48.510 --> 04:27:49.680
<v Speaker 6>but not so close.</v>

9591
04:27:51.490 --> 04:27:52.281
<v Speaker 6>Look at that one that went,</v>

9600
04:28:08.860 --> 04:28:12.870
<v Speaker 6>This was the one when the dudes on the top of an elephant and the tiger decides</v>

9626
04:28:49.380 --> 04:28:52.410
<v Speaker 6>There's a video that I just watched the other day of a tiger making a run at a</v>

9627
04:28:52.411 --> 04:28:54.960
<v Speaker 6>guy and then at the last minute it turns.</v>

9628
04:28:55.470 --> 04:28:59.400
<v Speaker 6>But as it's angry and it's in full fury and it's making a runner,</v>

9629
04:28:59.430 --> 04:29:01.770
<v Speaker 6>it moves so much quicker than I thought they could.</v>

9630
04:29:02.400 --> 04:29:03.450
<v Speaker 6>So much quicker.</v>

9631
04:29:03.990 --> 04:29:06.180
<v Speaker 6>It was like a fucking regular cat,</v>

9632
04:29:06.210 --> 04:29:07.890
<v Speaker 6>but like 600 pounds,</v>

9633
04:29:10.020 --> 04:29:11.010
<v Speaker 6>tiger kills.</v>

9634
04:29:11.011 --> 04:29:12.790
<v Speaker 6>What slot there?</v>

9635
04:29:12.870 --> 04:29:13.710
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

9636
04:29:13.770 --> 04:29:13.921
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

9637
04:29:13.921 --> 04:29:14.820
<v Speaker 6>these guys are dead.</v>

9638
04:29:15.150 --> 04:29:15.990
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's dead.</v>

9639
04:29:16.020 --> 04:29:17.070
<v Speaker 6>They killed crocodiles,</v>

9640
04:29:17.071 --> 04:29:17.904
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

9641
04:29:18.590 --> 04:29:20.820
<v Speaker 6>Have you seen those ones and Jaguars in Brazil?</v>

9642
04:29:21.260 --> 04:29:23.190
<v Speaker 6>The jumping it right.</v>

9643
04:29:23.520 --> 04:29:24.353
<v Speaker 6>My God.</v>

04:29:25.320 --> 04:29:27.780
<v Speaker 6>The goal thing across it's warm enough.</v>

9645
04:29:27.870 --> 04:29:28.920
<v Speaker 6>I was talking about leopard,</v>

9646
04:29:28.921 --> 04:29:29.671
<v Speaker 6>so I think,</v>

9647
04:29:29.671 --> 04:29:30.780
<v Speaker 6>or Jaguars rather,</v>

9648
04:29:31.140 --> 04:29:34.710
<v Speaker 6>which are even smaller than tigers and they kill those Caymans in Brazil.</v>

9649
04:29:35.160 --> 04:29:36.990
<v Speaker 6>There's a bunch of those videos that come behind them.</v>

9650
04:29:37.620 --> 04:29:39.390
<v Speaker 6>They treat them like their food man.</v>

9651
04:29:39.420 --> 04:29:40.350
<v Speaker 6>They just jack them.</v>

9652
04:29:40.380 --> 04:29:40.561
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>

9653
04:29:40.561 --> 04:29:42.210
<v Speaker 6>How fucking scares a tiger though,</v>

04:29:43.240 --> 04:29:43.690
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

9656
04:29:43.690 --> 04:29:48.160
<v Speaker 6>I get this thing is chasing after these fees about like those African lions look</v>

9657
04:29:48.340 --> 04:29:49.170
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

9658
04:29:49.170 --> 04:29:50.790
<v Speaker 6>But imagine you're in this fucking,</v>

9659
04:29:50.850 --> 04:29:52.170

<v Speaker 6>You want to live around tigers that he wanted to live around.</v>

9664
04:29:57.451 --> 04:29:58.920

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

10012
04:39:24.341 --> 04:39:27.250
<v Speaker 5>whales and dolphins are similar in that the marine mammals,</v>

10013
04:39:27.251 --> 04:39:29.860
<v Speaker 5>but like as far as like this species goes,</v>

10014
04:39:30.250 --> 04:39:33.280
<v Speaker 5>killer orcas apparently are closer to dolphin.</v>

10015
04:39:33.281 --> 04:39:33.880
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that.</v>

10016
04:39:33.880 --> 04:39:34.990
<v Speaker 5>They're super close to doff.</v>

10017
04:39:34.991 --> 04:39:36.460
<v Speaker 5>That's why they're both smart as shit.</v>

10018
04:39:36.461 --> 04:39:37.271
<v Speaker 5>Smart Shit.</v>

10019
04:39:37.271 --> 04:39:38.440
<v Speaker 5>But they kill each other.</v>

10020
04:39:39.550 --> 04:39:41.620
<v Speaker 5>Mostly orchids kill dolphins,</v>

10021
04:39:41.740 --> 04:39:42.640
<v Speaker 5>but orchids,</v>

10022
04:39:42.660 --> 04:39:43.130
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

10023
04:39:43.130 --> 04:39:44.860
<v Speaker 5>Killer whales and it can't,</v>

10024
04:39:44.861 --> 04:39:45.491
<v Speaker 5>it can't.</v>

10025
04:39:45.491 --> 04:39:46.510
<v Speaker 5>They kill great whites too,</v>

10026
04:39:46.511 --> 04:39:49.310
<v Speaker 5>like they fucking punks at a great,</v>

10027
04:39:49.320 --> 04:39:49.411
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

10028
04:39:49.411 --> 04:39:50.530
<v Speaker 5>they've killed great whites.</v>

10029
04:39:50.531 --> 04:39:52.060
<v Speaker 5>There's so much smarter and bigger.</v>

10030
04:39:52.170 --> 04:39:53.410
<v Speaker 5>Where do you see that on Youtube?</v>

10031
04:39:53.590 --> 04:39:56.770
<v Speaker 5>He has a video of a mama and protecting her house.</v>

10032
04:39:56.860 --> 04:39:58.210
<v Speaker 5>What does time that Youtube works?</v>

10033
04:39:58.211 --> 04:39:58.481
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

04:39:58.481 --> 04:40:00.430
<v Speaker 5>what is a a a baby?</v>

10035
04:40:00.820 --> 04:40:01.653
<v Speaker 5>What do you call a baby?</v>

10036
04:40:02.650 --> 04:40:04.180
<v Speaker 5>A baby or calf.</v>

10037
04:40:04.181 --> 04:40:06.380
<v Speaker 5>Was it a calf calf?</v>

10038
04:40:06.390 --> 04:40:07.223
<v Speaker 5>Barb Guy.</v>

10039
04:40:07.330 --> 04:40:08.170
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that weird?</v>

10040
04:40:08.171 --> 04:40:09.280
<v Speaker 5>Why can't we just call it a baby?</v>

10041
04:40:09.281 --> 04:40:11.650
<v Speaker 5>Why can't admit their smartest shit is weird.</v>

10042
04:40:11.980 --> 04:40:12.940
<v Speaker 5>But they kill whales.</v>

10043
04:40:12.941 --> 04:40:14.290
<v Speaker 5>Do they bite their faces?</v>

10044
04:40:14.710 --> 04:40:15.640
<v Speaker 5>So it's rough.</v>

10045
04:40:15.700 --> 04:40:16.481
<v Speaker 5>There's one video.</v>

10046
04:40:16.481 --> 04:40:17.314
<v Speaker 5>It really,</v>

10047
04:40:17.410 --> 04:40:18.490
<v Speaker 5>I'd love to see it.</v>

10048
04:40:18.730 --> 04:40:21.850
<v Speaker 5>It's a killer whale killing a whale and he bites his face.</v>

10049
04:40:21.851 --> 04:40:23.510
<v Speaker 5>Just chewing this whales face off.</v>

10050
04:40:23.760 --> 04:40:24.340
<v Speaker 5>Duct here.</v>

10051
04:40:24.340 --> 04:40:25.910
<v Speaker 5>Wisdom apart motherfucker.</v>

10052
04:40:25.911 --> 04:40:26.744
<v Speaker 5>The Yang is shit.</v>

10053
04:40:26.790 --> 04:40:27.420
<v Speaker 5>I mean Shit,</v>

10054
04:40:27.420 --> 04:40:28.270
<v Speaker 5>because the sham move,</v>

10055
04:40:28.271 --> 04:40:31.710
<v Speaker 5>we grew up thinking they're all cool and friendly to us.</v>

10056
04:40:32.310 --> 04:40:32.890
<v Speaker 5>A Pencil,</v>

10057
04:40:32.890 --> 04:40:33.880
<v Speaker 5>Tony Montana,</v>

10058
04:40:33.950 --> 04:40:34.780
<v Speaker 5>seaworld.</v>

10059
04:40:34.780 --> 04:40:37.480
<v Speaker 5>But in reality I Pablo Escobar,</v>

10060
04:40:37.660 --> 04:40:39.280
<v Speaker 5>I had read something that wasn't true.</v>

10061
04:40:39.430 --> 04:40:40.660
<v Speaker 5>I read something that wasn't true.</v>

10062
04:40:40.661 --> 04:40:42.940
<v Speaker 5>But as one of those things that you read and it sounds so awesome,</v>

10063
04:40:42.941 --> 04:40:44.230
<v Speaker 5>you don't want it to not be true.</v>

10064
04:40:44.620 --> 04:40:49.360
<v Speaker 5>But what I read was that killer whales used to kill people until World War Two</v>

10065
04:40:49.540 --> 04:40:52.450
<v Speaker 5>when they started using planes and they used,</v>

10066
04:40:52.570 --> 04:40:55.420
<v Speaker 5>do you use killer whales for Tiger target practice?</v>

10067
04:40:55.510 --> 04:40:56.261
<v Speaker 5>That's some bullshit.</v>

10068
04:40:56.261 --> 04:40:57.280
<v Speaker 5>It's totally bullshit,</v>

10069
04:40:57.281 --> 04:40:59.290
<v Speaker 5>but I heard it and I got so excited.</v>

10070
04:40:59.600 --> 04:41:00.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

10071
04:41:00.430 --> 04:41:02.410
<v Speaker 5>How do you know what the bullshit you're measuring that Joe.</v>

10072
04:41:02.860 --> 04:41:03.460
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's real.</v>

10073
04:41:03.460 --> 04:41:04.300
<v Speaker 5>How do you know it's bullshit?</v>

10074
04:41:04.330 --> 04:41:04.481
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

10075
04:41:04.481 --> 04:41:08.280
<v Speaker 5>because is because they sent it on CNN because I'm educated MSN.</v>

10076
04:41:08.480 --> 04:41:10.900
<v Speaker 5>Just cause I'm educated that there's no way that was.</v>

10077
04:41:10.901 --> 04:41:11.350
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

10078
04:41:11.350 --> 04:41:14.560
<v Speaker 5>there's no evidence that they ever killed anybody other than in captivity.</v>

10079
04:41:14.740 --> 04:41:19.150
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying what they know as far as evidence of killer whales attacking</v>

10080
04:41:19.151 --> 04:41:19.984
<v Speaker 5>human beings,</v>

10081
04:41:20.710 --> 04:41:24.250
<v Speaker 5>there's almost no record of anything ever happening in the wild.</v>

10082
04:41:24.280 --> 04:41:25.520
<v Speaker 5>What if they covered that shit up?</v>

10083
04:41:26.140 --> 04:41:27.010
<v Speaker 5>Why would they do that?</v>

10084
04:41:27.011 --> 04:41:27.820
<v Speaker 5>The too busy.</v>

10085
04:41:27.820 --> 04:41:30.340
<v Speaker 5>Because the foundation and sea world,</v>

10086
04:41:30.610 --> 04:41:31.443
<v Speaker 5>they don't have time.</v>

10087
04:41:31.540 --> 04:41:31.901
<v Speaker 5>Is this?</v>

10088
04:41:31.901 --> 04:41:32.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

10089
04:41:32.260 --> 04:41:32.441
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

10090
04:41:32.441 --> 04:41:36.730

10091
04:41:36.731 --> 04:41:37.564
<v Speaker 5>Here.</v>

10092
04:41:37.650 --> 04:41:38.490
<v Speaker 5>There's a tiger shark.</v>

10093
04:41:38.850 --> 04:41:39.683
<v Speaker 5>Tiger Shark.</v>

10094
04:41:40.000 --> 04:41:40.270
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

10095
04:41:40.270 --> 04:41:41.590
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a humpback whale.</v>

10096
04:41:42.430 --> 04:41:44.710
<v Speaker 5>They've never killed humans.</v>

10097
04:41:45.040 --> 04:41:45.461
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

10100
04:41:47.260 --> 04:41:48.280

10101
04:41:48.890 --> 04:41:51.100
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they know that we're not competing based.</v>

04:43:25.590 --> 04:43:28.490
<v Speaker 6>We just forgot because Peter Benchley wrote jaws.</v>

10155
04:43:28.491 --> 04:43:29.840
<v Speaker 6>Jaws was a hit novel,</v>

10165
04:43:40.521 --> 04:43:41.810
<v Speaker 6>it was the plot of the movie.</v>

<v Speaker 6>but this wasn't that.</v>

10169
04:43:45.231 --> 04:43:45.950
<v Speaker 6>It was a novel.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

10321
04:48:19.301 --> 04:48:19.960
<v Speaker 4>White City.</v>

<v Speaker 4>a Jacuzzi for great white.</v>

10325
04:48:30.460 --> 04:48:31.480
<v Speaker 4>You can't go into water there,</v>

10326
04:48:31.600 --> 04:48:32.890
<v Speaker 4>but on the,</v>

10327
04:48:33.250 --> 04:48:34.660
<v Speaker 4>on the California coast,</v>

04:48:43.001 --> 04:48:46.140
<v Speaker 4>That's where everyone's going to tie in great whites.</v>

10335
04:48:46.840 --> 04:48:49.300
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think great whites aren't attacking people around here,</v>

10336
04:48:49.420 --> 04:48:52.150
<v Speaker 4>but they're tracking people at crazy in like South Africa?</v>

04:48:52.360 --> 04:48:52.541
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

10340
04:48:56.861 --> 04:48:57.381
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>

10341
04:48:57.381 --> 04:48:58.214
<v Speaker 4>It's not that often.</v>

10342
04:48:58.300 --> 04:49:01.000
<v Speaker 4>There hasn't been a death in one of the things they'd been finding out when</v>

10343
04:49:01.001 --> 04:49:02.260
<v Speaker 4>they've been doing all these studies,</v>

10344
04:49:02.261 --> 04:49:05.560
<v Speaker 4>especially they fly over them with cameras and they look down,</v>

10345
04:49:05.561 --> 04:49:06.880
<v Speaker 4>they're finding great whites,</v>

10346
04:49:07.090 --> 04:49:08.440
<v Speaker 4>a hundred yards off shore.</v>

10347
04:49:08.540 --> 04:49:09.610
<v Speaker 4>Finding babies.</v>

10348
04:49:09.670 --> 04:49:09.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

10349
04:49:09.860 --> 04:49:11.130
<v Speaker 4>They're finding the young ones here.</v>

10350
04:49:12.330 --> 04:49:13.000
<v Speaker 4>Let's go.</v>

10351
04:49:13.000 --> 04:49:13.510
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

10352
04:49:13.510 --> 04:49:15.040
<v Speaker 4>They breed in San Francisco,</v>

10353
04:49:15.250 --> 04:49:19.540
<v Speaker 4>they'll have a pop popular beats where all these mother fucking tours that in</v>

10354
04:49:19.541 --> 04:49:24.541
<v Speaker 4>the beach and like maybe a mile off the coast that they're monitoring all these</v>

10355
04:49:25.271 --> 04:49:26.021
<v Speaker 4>great whites.</v>

10356
04:49:26.021 --> 04:49:26.980
<v Speaker 4>I just looking at them,</v>

10357
04:49:27.100 --> 04:49:31.630
<v Speaker 4>they're in helicopters that are in plants and the adolescents are kind of close.</v>

10358
04:49:31.870 --> 04:49:33.070
<v Speaker 4>But they know that those,</v>

10359
04:49:33.250 --> 04:49:35.110
<v Speaker 4>those little teenagers don't attack humans.</v>

10360
04:49:35.110 --> 04:49:38.590
<v Speaker 4>I know that their people are in the water.</v>

10361
04:49:38.770 --> 04:49:41.500
<v Speaker 4>While there is some task force,</v>

10362
04:49:41.501 --> 04:49:46.501
<v Speaker 4>some great white shark task force monitoring the great whites to make sure they</v>

10363
04:49:47.921 --> 04:49:49.360
<v Speaker 4>don't get that close.</v>

10364
04:49:49.660 --> 04:49:52.270
<v Speaker 4>That's every day in South Africa.</v>

10365
04:49:52.450 --> 04:49:54.520
<v Speaker 4>They're there and they could spot them.</v>

10366
04:49:54.521 --> 04:49:56.220
<v Speaker 4>They could see him cause the water's clear.</v>

10367
04:49:56.230 --> 04:49:56.710
<v Speaker 4>What do they do?</v>

10368
04:49:56.710 --> 04:49:57.850
<v Speaker 4>And if they get too close,</v>

10369
04:49:58.000 --> 04:49:58.710
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

10370
04:49:58.710 --> 04:50:00.450

04:50:06.760 --> 04:50:09.790
<v Speaker 4>Why don't they put up like a net that anything would kill all the animals?</v>

10373
04:50:09.810 --> 04:50:09.971
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

10374
04:50:09.971 --> 04:50:13.660
<v Speaker 4>anything smaller than like a fucking tuna can get through to them.</v>

10375
04:50:13.730 --> 04:50:16.190
<v Speaker 4>The dolphins and stuff get caught in those measures here.</v>

10376
04:50:16.220 --> 04:50:16.500
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

10377
04:50:16.500 --> 04:50:17.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm an asshole.</v>

10378
04:50:18.520 --> 04:50:21.270
<v Speaker 4>But I was thinking there's gotta be a way to like put up something.</v>

10379
04:50:21.280 --> 04:50:25.180
<v Speaker 4>They can walk on the discovery channel they had,</v>

10380
04:50:25.181 --> 04:50:26.890
<v Speaker 4>they had this guy put up like these,</v>

10381
04:50:26.950 --> 04:50:28.400
<v Speaker 4>these poles at the bottom.</v>

10382
04:50:28.401 --> 04:50:33.401
<v Speaker 4>The CLCs can be a beast to do have these poles and it would send off like just</v>

04:51:53.081 --> 04:51:53.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

10432
04:51:53.650 --> 04:51:55.240
<v Speaker 5>I think there's</v>

10433
04:51:55.570 --> 04:51:57.470
<v Speaker 6>so really needs,</v>

10434
04:51:57.510 --> 04:51:58.050
<v Speaker 6>bro.</v>

10435
04:51:58.050 --> 04:51:59.430
<v Speaker 6>There's so little evidence</v>

10436
04:51:59.470 --> 04:52:00.970
<v Speaker 5>that anybody's ever visited us.</v>

10437
04:52:01.000 --> 04:52:01.833
<v Speaker 5>It's in [inaudible].</v>

10438
04:52:01.930 --> 04:52:03.430
<v Speaker 5>This is a crazy thought,</v>

10439
04:52:03.520 --> 04:52:04.390
<v Speaker 5>but think about it.</v>

10440
04:52:04.840 --> 04:52:06.730
<v Speaker 5>If there has to be a point,</v>

10441
04:52:06.760 --> 04:52:07.121
<v Speaker 5>if they're,</v>

10442
04:52:07.121 --> 04:52:12.121
<v Speaker 5>if the earth was at one time this thing that had no life and it evolved to be</v>

10443
04:52:12.521 --> 04:52:13.510
<v Speaker 5>the thing that's like,</v>

10444
04:52:13.540 --> 04:52:14.171
<v Speaker 5>today we're,</v>

10445
04:52:14.171 --> 04:52:15.790
<v Speaker 5>we're on the Internet and we're driving,</v>

10446
04:52:15.791 --> 04:52:16.780
<v Speaker 5>cars were flying,</v>

10447
04:52:16.781 --> 04:52:18.910
<v Speaker 5>planes were sending video through this guy.</v>

10448
04:52:19.540 --> 04:52:22.360
<v Speaker 5>It's entirely possible that were the first things to do this.</v>

10449
04:52:23.110 --> 04:52:26.830
<v Speaker 5>Even though we'd like to thank the university around for so long that for sure</v>

10450
04:52:26.831 --> 04:52:29.890
<v Speaker 5>there's ever other civilizations out there in this infinite universe.</v>

10451
04:52:30.400 --> 04:52:31.233
<v Speaker 5>Maybe</v>

10452
04:52:34.590 --> 04:52:36.570
<v Speaker 6>Brunette fucking mix slap,</v>

10453
04:52:36.650 --> 04:52:37.150
<v Speaker 6>maybe.</v>

10454
04:52:37.150 --> 04:52:37.670
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

10455
04:52:37.670 --> 04:52:38.140
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't.</v>

10456
04:52:38.140 --> 04:52:38.500
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't</v>

10457
04:52:38.500 --> 04:52:42.310
<v Speaker 5>necessarily know whether or not there's alien life in other planets and there</v>

10458
04:52:42.311 --> 04:52:43.144
<v Speaker 5>might be.</v>

10459
04:52:43.270 --> 04:52:45.220
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing about infinity.</v>

10460
04:52:45.730 --> 04:52:50.730
<v Speaker 5>The reality is if we are the first ever intelligent life and we're the first</v>

10461
04:52:52.061 --> 04:52:53.320
<v Speaker 5>things to ever hit this point,</v>

10462
04:52:53.321 --> 04:52:54.060
<v Speaker 5>would they be,</v>

10463
04:52:54.060 --> 04:52:54.881
<v Speaker 5>if we don't know,</v>

10464
04:52:54.881 --> 04:52:55.181
<v Speaker 5>we don't.</v>

10465
04:52:55.181 --> 04:52:56.830
<v Speaker 5>We never experienced anything smarter than us.</v>

10466
04:52:56.860 --> 04:52:58.120
<v Speaker 5>Not to say that we're so awesome,</v>

10467
04:52:58.121 --> 04:53:01.390
<v Speaker 5>but we haven't run into any other intelligent life anywhere in the universe.</v>

10468
04:53:01.391 --> 04:53:02.110
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

10469
04:53:02.110 --> 04:53:06.700
<v Speaker 5>It's possible they say that not only is this the first time that this has ever</v>

10470
04:53:06.701 --> 04:53:07.510
<v Speaker 5>happened,</v>

10471
04:53:07.510 --> 04:53:12.510
<v Speaker 5>but this is happening simultaneously in infinite worlds that behave exactly the</v>

10472
04:53:14.741 --> 04:53:16.120
<v Speaker 5>same way as this world,</v>

10473
04:53:16.300 --> 04:53:19.990
<v Speaker 5>an infinite universes that every fucking thing that's ever happened,</v>

10474
04:53:19.991 --> 04:53:21.130
<v Speaker 5>including our El Con,</v>

10475
04:53:21.310 --> 04:53:23.680
<v Speaker 5>including this crazy tower seven talk,</v>

10476
04:53:23.681 --> 04:53:25.450
<v Speaker 5>including is fucking incredible,</v>

10477
04:53:26.170 --> 04:53:30.790
<v Speaker 5>incredible fight between Bisbing and Henderson is happening to the exact same</v>

10478
04:53:31.050 --> 04:53:34.150
<v Speaker 5>nanosecond in an infinite number of worlds,</v>

10479
04:53:34.151 --> 04:53:36.000
<v Speaker 5>in an infinite number of times zone.</v>

10480
04:53:36.610 --> 04:53:36.980
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

10481
04:53:36.980 --> 04:53:40.390
<v Speaker 5>but there's no evidence that we're here other than the fact that we know we're</v>

10482
04:53:40.391 --> 04:53:41.050
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

10483
04:53:41.050 --> 04:53:41.920
<v Speaker 5>How do we not,</v>

10484
04:53:41.950 --> 04:53:42.401
<v Speaker 5>how do we,</v>

10485
04:53:42.401 --> 04:53:44.190
<v Speaker 5>not that this is</v>

10486
04:53:44.190 --> 04:53:46.290
<v Speaker 1>probably not just common,</v>

10487
04:53:46.440 --> 04:53:48.330
<v Speaker 1>but constant all throughout the sky.</v>

10488
04:53:48.360 --> 04:53:49.470
<v Speaker 1>How about how about one thing,</v>

10489
04:53:49.471 --> 04:53:49.830
<v Speaker 1>here's an,</v>

10490
04:53:49.830 --> 04:53:51.510
<v Speaker 1>here's a new thing that I never thought about.</v>

10491
04:53:51.511 --> 04:53:52.860
<v Speaker 1>What the whole moon hoax,</v>

10492
04:53:53.070 --> 04:53:53.760
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

10493
04:53:53.760 --> 04:53:57.150
<v Speaker 1>there is no video of a video.</v>

10494
04:53:57.151 --> 04:54:01.920
<v Speaker 1>There's all this video of dudes on the moon with a fucking moon buggy that</v>

10495
04:54:02.580 --> 04:54:03.060
<v Speaker 1>listen up,</v>

10496
04:54:03.060 --> 04:54:03.780
<v Speaker 1>listen on,</v>

10497
04:54:03.780 --> 04:54:06.750
<v Speaker 1>but there's no video footage of,</v>

10498
04:54:07.200 --> 04:54:07.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10499
04:54:07.380 --> 04:54:08.520
<v Speaker 1>video footage of boom,</v>

10500
04:54:08.521 --> 04:54:09.480
<v Speaker 1>here's an astronaut,</v>

10501
04:54:09.600 --> 04:54:11.850
<v Speaker 1>here's the earth and here's an Astra,</v>

10502
04:54:11.940 --> 04:54:12.690
<v Speaker 1>here's earth.</v>

10503
04:54:12.690 --> 04:54:17.690
<v Speaker 1>They went up how many times and there's not one swooping shot of the earth and</v>

10504
04:54:18.721 --> 04:54:21.630
<v Speaker 1>the astronauts and the earth and the shitty cameramen</v>

10505
04:54:24.920 --> 04:54:27.600
<v Speaker 1>to take pictures of anything back then was pretty crude.</v>

10506
04:54:27.601 --> 04:54:32.601
<v Speaker 1>All they needed was then they really think they released those pictures on the</v>

10507
04:54:33.511 --> 04:54:35.040
<v Speaker 1>NASA website,</v>

10508
04:54:35.280 --> 04:54:40.280
<v Speaker 1>proven fake Russian birth from moon that she was proven fake.</v>

10509
04:54:41.430 --> 04:54:42.990
<v Speaker 1>There's like two different ones they released.</v>

10510
04:54:43.050 --> 04:54:44.040
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit,</v>

10511
04:54:44.280 --> 04:54:45.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's all perfect.</v>

10512
04:54:45.840 --> 04:54:48.750
<v Speaker 1>The picture of the earth is all perfect from the moon,</v>

10513
04:54:48.930 --> 04:54:51.210
<v Speaker 1>but then you couldn't get no goddamn video.</v>

10514
04:54:51.360 --> 04:54:54.300
<v Speaker 1>All those hours of video on the moon.</v>

10515
04:54:54.390 --> 04:54:57.060
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't swoop up to the Goddamn Earth.</v>

10516
04:54:57.180 --> 04:54:59.040
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't get any go camera,</v>

10517
04:54:59.050 --> 04:55:02.640
<v Speaker 1>no video of the earth from moon.</v>

10518
04:55:02.760 --> 04:55:03.331
<v Speaker 1>And we went,</v>

10519
04:55:03.331 --> 04:55:04.860
<v Speaker 1>how many mother fucking times.</v>

10520
04:55:05.520 --> 04:55:06.500
<v Speaker 1>How many motherfucker done?</v>

10521
04:55:06.520 --> 04:55:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Six Times successful?</v>

10522
04:55:07.790 --> 04:55:09.510
<v Speaker 1>There's no video.</v>

10523
04:55:11.920 --> 04:55:13.620
<v Speaker 1>They've got pictures that were proven fake.</v>

10524
04:55:13.710 --> 04:55:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Why are they faking picture?</v>

10525
04:55:15.860 --> 04:55:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Why they taking pictures?</v>

10526
04:55:17.890 --> 04:55:18.723
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

10527
04:55:19.290 --> 04:55:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's already looking into it and he knows.</v>

10528
04:55:21.380 --> 04:55:22.260
<v Speaker 1>He knows that's real.</v>

10529
04:55:22.860 --> 04:55:23.693
<v Speaker 1>There's no video.</v>

10530
04:55:23.840 --> 04:55:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Here's one thing from the moon.</v>

10531
04:55:26.760 --> 04:55:29.310
<v Speaker 1>One thing they absolutely did fake is Michael Collins.</v>

10532
04:55:29.311 --> 04:55:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Somebody did it.</v>

10533
04:55:30.000 --> 04:55:30.660
<v Speaker 1>We don't know who.</v>

10534
04:55:30.660 --> 04:55:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem.</v>

10535
04:55:31.440 --> 04:55:31.681
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10536
04:55:31.681 --> 04:55:33.900
<v Speaker 1>it could have been an overzealous PR representative,</v>

10537
04:55:34.110 --> 04:55:35.710
<v Speaker 1>but Michael Collins from uh,</v>

10538
04:55:35.790 --> 04:55:37.080
<v Speaker 1>one of the Gemini missions,</v>

10539
04:55:37.290 --> 04:55:41.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a photo of him where they blacked out the background and pretended that</v>

10540
04:55:41.041 --> 04:55:42.540
<v Speaker 1>it was a photo that was taken in space,</v>

10541
04:55:42.720 --> 04:55:43.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's an identical photo.</v>

10542
04:55:43.981 --> 04:55:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Just reversed of how about that with him in a training?</v>

10543
04:55:48.230 --> 04:55:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

10544
04:55:48.510 --> 04:55:50.430
<v Speaker 1>he was in a training program,</v>

10545
04:55:50.490 --> 04:55:54.020
<v Speaker 1>so he's hooked up a harness and the whole deal and wires in the background,</v>

10546
04:55:54.021 --> 04:55:54.930
<v Speaker 1>it's all over her.</v>

10547
04:55:54.931 --> 04:55:55.111
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

10548
04:55:55.111 --> 04:55:55.681
<v Speaker 1>you could see it.</v>

10549
04:55:55.681 --> 04:55:56.514
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is,</v>

10550
04:55:56.550 --> 04:55:57.630
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>

10551
04:55:57.750 --> 04:55:59.310
<v Speaker 1>and this is just me trying to be fair.</v>

10552
04:55:59.490 --> 04:56:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows who did that?</v>

10553
04:56:01.230 --> 04:56:04.620
<v Speaker 1>It could have been some idiot who thought he was smarter than everybody and he</v>

10554
04:56:04.621 --> 04:56:07.900
<v Speaker 1>worked for the Pr Department of NASA and they didn't have any good photos.</v>

10555
04:56:07.901 --> 04:56:08.491
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

10556
04:56:08.491 --> 04:56:09.031
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

10557
04:56:09.031 --> 04:56:09.600
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

10558
04:56:09.600 --> 04:56:13.680
<v Speaker 1>It ain't easy to fucking take photos while you're in a space walk.</v>

10559
04:56:13.980 --> 04:56:14.341
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

10560
04:56:14.341 --> 04:56:16.770
<v Speaker 1>And if a dude is really out there doing a space walk,</v>

10561
04:56:17.310 --> 04:56:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it's entirely possible that they could lie and fake photos and twist</v>

10562
04:56:22.951 --> 04:56:23.784
<v Speaker 1>stuff around.</v>

10563
04:56:23.940 --> 04:56:24.301
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

10564
04:56:24.301 --> 04:56:28.590
<v Speaker 1>this is the 1960s taking kind of do whatever the fuck they want it to,</v>

10565
04:56:28.770 --> 04:56:29.760
<v Speaker 1>but you'd never seen this before.</v>

10566
04:56:29.761 --> 04:56:30.594
<v Speaker 1>I want you to see this.</v>

10567
04:56:30.630 --> 04:56:31.463
<v Speaker 1>I want to see it.</v>

10568
04:56:31.530 --> 04:56:32.363

10636
04:58:26.160 --> 04:58:28.020
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] k.com as you,</v>

10637
04:58:29.090 --> 04:58:30.640
<v Speaker 6>I Ebi,</v>

10638
04:58:30.760 --> 04:58:31.593
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

10639
04:58:31.800 --> 04:58:32.210
<v Speaker 6>Haley,</v>

10640
04:58:32.210 --> 04:58:34.030
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to ask you one question before we go.</v>

10641
04:58:34.720 --> 04:58:35.830
<v Speaker 6>I saw something that yeah,</v>

10642
04:58:35.831 --> 04:58:37.570
<v Speaker 6>John Danaher was writing about palm strikes.</v>

10643
04:58:37.571 --> 04:58:38.590
<v Speaker 6>You're going to implement that.</v>

10644
04:58:38.591 --> 04:58:39.424
<v Speaker 6>I think about it.</v>

10645
04:58:40.310 --> 04:58:45.310
<v Speaker 11>It's for the first show of 2017 is going to be the one 70 Ebi tournament.</v>

10646
04:58:46.521 --> 04:58:50.090
<v Speaker 11>So it's going to be regular Ebi rules for the 16 Guy Tournament.</v>

10647
04:58:50.390 --> 04:58:55.390
<v Speaker 11>Regular Ebi 16 first show of 2017 but we usually have three a special matches</v>

10648
04:58:58.551 --> 04:58:59.810
<v Speaker 11>and they used to be,</v>

10649
04:59:00.070 --> 04:59:00.620
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

10650
04:59:00.620 --> 04:59:01.610
<v Speaker 11>teenagers and stuff,</v>

10651
04:59:01.611 --> 04:59:03.950
<v Speaker 11>but we can't use minors anymore and stuff.</v>

10652
04:59:03.951 --> 04:59:04.450
<v Speaker 11>So,</v>

10653
04:59:04.450 --> 04:59:05.870
<v Speaker 11>so what we're going to use those three,</v>

10654
04:59:05.960 --> 04:59:08.300
<v Speaker 11>we would do a round of the 16 man tournament,</v>

10655
04:59:08.450 --> 04:59:09.590
<v Speaker 11>then throw a special match,</v>

10656
04:59:09.591 --> 04:59:10.424
<v Speaker 11>let everyone ref,</v>

10657
04:59:10.430 --> 04:59:13.240
<v Speaker 11>then do another round and then a special master to everyone rest.</v>

10658
04:59:13.370 --> 04:59:15.320
<v Speaker 11>And then that final semifinal round.</v>

10659
04:59:15.470 --> 04:59:16.700
<v Speaker 11>So before the finals,</v>

10660
04:59:16.850 --> 04:59:17.780
<v Speaker 11>there's one more.</v>

10661
04:59:17.781 --> 04:59:19.130
<v Speaker 11>So there's three special matches.</v>

10662
04:59:19.280 --> 04:59:22.580
<v Speaker 11>Now when we're going to do is us three special matches are going to be a four</v>

10663
04:59:22.581 --> 04:59:26.270
<v Speaker 11>man combat Jujitsu tournament where it's,</v>

10664
04:59:26.320 --> 04:59:29.480
<v Speaker 11>I had this clear through the commission years ago,</v>

10665
04:59:29.481 --> 04:59:32.450
<v Speaker 11>but it kind of got stalled with some of the rules.</v>

10666
04:59:32.450 --> 04:59:33.231
<v Speaker 11>They wouldn't let me,</v>

10667
04:59:33.231 --> 04:59:34.064
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

10668
04:59:34.310 --> 04:59:38.000
<v Speaker 11>they didn't want to do it outside of cage and they didn't want to give me more</v>

10669
04:59:38.001 --> 04:59:38.811
<v Speaker 11>than three,</v>

10670
04:59:38.811 --> 04:59:39.830
<v Speaker 11>three rounds.</v>

10671
04:59:40.010 --> 04:59:44.110
<v Speaker 11>So Ebi was always about having combat Jujitsu,</v>

10672
04:59:44.210 --> 04:59:46.310
<v Speaker 11>Jujitsu with some palm strikes,</v>

10673
04:59:46.430 --> 04:59:48.230
<v Speaker 11>just to keep him honest,</v>

10674
04:59:48.410 --> 04:59:51.350
<v Speaker 11>just to keep her Jujitsu a little more real.</v>

10675
04:59:51.590 --> 04:59:53.660
<v Speaker 11>Because when you don't have zero strikes,</v>

10676
04:59:53.990 --> 04:59:54.261
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>

10677
04:59:54.261 --> 04:59:54.890
<v Speaker 11>MMA,</v>

10678
04:59:54.890 --> 04:59:55.970
<v Speaker 11>MMA is the ultimate,</v>

10679
04:59:56.060 --> 04:59:56.690
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

10680
04:59:56.690 --> 04:59:57.880
<v Speaker 11>UFC all,</v>

10681
04:59:57.950 --> 04:59:58.611
<v Speaker 11>you got punches,</v>

10682
04:59:58.611 --> 04:59:59.311
<v Speaker 11>you've got elbows,</v>

10683
04:59:59.311 --> 05:00:00.080
<v Speaker 11>he got kicks.</v>

10684
05:00:00.080 --> 05:00:04.580
<v Speaker 11>But I want her to make w Jujitsu just a little more realistic.</v>

10685
05:00:04.610 --> 05:00:06.170
<v Speaker 11>It's always been the plan.</v>

10686
05:00:06.260 --> 05:00:07.580
<v Speaker 11>That was before Ebi.</v>

10687
05:00:07.581 --> 05:00:09.290
<v Speaker 11>I was trying to push combat Jiu Jitsu through.</v>

10688
05:00:09.410 --> 05:00:12.710
<v Speaker 11>We have two matches to go onto youtube punch in combat Jujitsu,</v>

10689
05:00:12.830 --> 05:00:13.730
<v Speaker 11>we did two matches.</v>

10690
05:00:13.731 --> 05:00:14.810
<v Speaker 11>Compelling did a match.</v>

10691
05:00:15.040 --> 05:00:17.450
<v Speaker 11>Nate Harris from 10th Planet Santa Fe did a match.</v>

10692
05:00:17.600 --> 05:00:21.850
<v Speaker 11>We did two combat Jiu Jitsu matches and this style of Jujitsu,</v>

10693
05:00:22.080 --> 05:00:22.460
<v Speaker 11>no,</v>

10694
05:00:22.460 --> 05:00:23.300
<v Speaker 11>it's striking.</v>

10695
05:00:23.301 --> 05:00:24.200
<v Speaker 11>No Muay Thai,</v>

10696
05:00:24.201 --> 05:00:25.034
<v Speaker 11>no boxing,</v>

10697
05:00:25.160 --> 05:00:26.060
<v Speaker 11>none of that yet.</v>

10698
05:00:26.180 --> 05:00:27.350
<v Speaker 11>It's just par.</v>

10699
05:00:27.410 --> 05:00:29.720
<v Speaker 11>Just strikes when you're on the ground.</v>

10700
05:00:29.721 --> 05:00:30.160
<v Speaker 11>So it's,</v>

10701
05:00:30.160 --> 05:00:30.440
<v Speaker 11>it's,</v>

10702
05:00:30.440 --> 05:00:34.070
<v Speaker 11>it's generally for three different types of athletes.</v>

10703
05:00:34.340 --> 05:00:35.060
<v Speaker 11>I know</v>

10704
05:00:35.060 --> 05:00:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Brad cause them all times.</v>

10705
05:00:38.260 --> 05:00:39.093
<v Speaker 2>Can I ask you a question?</v>

10706
05:00:39.190 --> 05:00:41.020
<v Speaker 2>How do you define when someone's on the ground?</v>

<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

10751
05:01:46.451 --> 05:01:47.620
<v Speaker 2>I interrupted.</v>

10752
05:01:47.890 --> 05:01:51.850
<v Speaker 2>You were just going to say Ebia and then I brought in because I realized this</v>

10753
05:01:51.851 --> 05:01:56.170
<v Speaker 2>was something I wanted to cover so we technically correct.</v>

10754
05:01:56.380 --> 05:02:00.050
<v Speaker 2>I think we were both way cause he likes does wrap this kitchen.</v>

05:02:04.541 --> 05:02:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

10760
05:02:04.960 --> 05:02:05.920
<v Speaker 2>You're in trouble.</v>

10761
05:02:06.190 --> 05:02:07.023
<v Speaker 2>You have to be</v>

10762
05:02:09.840 --> 05:02:10.800
<v Speaker 2>five minutes ago.</v>

10763
05:02:12.940 --> 05:02:14.920
<v Speaker 2>We're getting off track because I want to hear this,</v>

10764
05:02:14.921 --> 05:02:19.540
<v Speaker 2>this idea cause so you can smack to the head into the body with an open palm.</v>

10765
05:02:19.580 --> 05:02:20.150
<v Speaker 2>Before</v>

10766
05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.983
<v Speaker 11>Abi,</v>

10767
05:02:21.320 --> 05:02:24.230
<v Speaker 11>I was trying to get combat Jujitsu through the most,</v>

10768
05:02:24.400 --> 05:02:24.790
<v Speaker 11>the,</v>

10769
05:02:24.790 --> 05:02:27.110
<v Speaker 11>the Jujitsu style that would most,</v>

10770
05:02:27.300 --> 05:02:27.530
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

10771
05:02:27.530 --> 05:02:28.360
<v Speaker 11>best,</v>

10772
05:02:28.360 --> 05:02:28.910
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

10773
05:02:28.910 --> 05:02:31.940
<v Speaker 11>prepare you for a career in MMA.</v>

10774
05:02:32.320 --> 05:02:32.480
<v Speaker 11>Right?</v>

10775
05:02:32.480 --> 05:02:33.920
<v Speaker 11>So that's what I was trying to do.</v>

10776
05:02:34.100 --> 05:02:35.030
<v Speaker 11>I had a couple fights.</v>

10777
05:02:35.031 --> 05:02:36.110
<v Speaker 11>We did it at university,</v>

10778
05:02:36.111 --> 05:02:38.820
<v Speaker 11>Lma w got it clear through the commission,</v>

10779
05:02:39.060 --> 05:02:44.060
<v Speaker 11>but I knew that we couldn't have it done in a cage and three,</v>

10780
05:02:44.101 --> 05:02:45.450
<v Speaker 11>three minute rounds can I,</v>

10781
05:02:45.630 --> 05:02:46.290
<v Speaker 11>that wasn't going to,</v>

10782
05:02:46.290 --> 05:02:47.220
<v Speaker 11>that wasn't going to cut it.</v>

10783
05:02:47.221 --> 05:02:48.660
<v Speaker 11>So I decided that's when I decided,</v>

10784
05:02:48.930 --> 05:02:49.381
<v Speaker 11>fuck it,</v>

10785
05:02:49.381 --> 05:02:50.580
<v Speaker 11>I'm not getting the rules I want.</v>

10786
05:02:50.590 --> 05:02:53.730
<v Speaker 11>Let me just do Ebi submission only.</v>

10787
05:02:53.910 --> 05:02:54.750
<v Speaker 11>No strikes,</v>

10788
05:02:54.810 --> 05:02:55.290
<v Speaker 11>submission,</v>

10789
05:02:55.290 --> 05:02:56.123
<v Speaker 11>only.</v>

10790
05:02:56.250 --> 05:02:57.870
<v Speaker 11>Get that going and see what happens.</v>

10791
05:02:57.960 --> 05:03:01.980
<v Speaker 11>And then later I'm going to come back and bring back combat.</v>

10792
05:03:02.000 --> 05:03:02.550
<v Speaker 11>You get to,</v>

10793
05:03:02.550 --> 05:03:03.390
<v Speaker 11>and that's what I'm doing now.</v>

10794
05:03:03.510 --> 05:03:05.430
<v Speaker 11>I'm not eliminating Ebi.</v>

10795
05:03:05.580 --> 05:03:07.290
<v Speaker 11>Who knows what's gonna happen in the future.</v>

10796
05:03:07.290 --> 05:03:08.400
<v Speaker 11>I don't know what it's going to be like.</v>

10797
05:03:08.580 --> 05:03:13.110
<v Speaker 11>But the first show in 2017 is going to be a 16 man tournament.</v>

10798
05:03:13.290 --> 05:03:15.780
<v Speaker 11>Just like it's always been submission only.</v>

10799
05:03:15.840 --> 05:03:16.621
<v Speaker 11>Same rules,</v>

10800
05:03:16.621 --> 05:03:17.454
<v Speaker 11>same overtime,</v>

10801
05:03:17.460 --> 05:03:22.460
<v Speaker 11>but in between every round we're going to have a four man combat Jiu Jitsu match</v>

10802
05:03:22.980 --> 05:03:25.170
<v Speaker 11>where there's palm strikes allowed.</v>

10803
05:03:25.260 --> 05:03:26.220
<v Speaker 11>It's not an MMA,</v>

10804
05:03:26.310 --> 05:03:27.420
<v Speaker 11>it's not the most gangster.</v>

10805
05:03:27.540 --> 05:03:29.730
<v Speaker 11>It just makes you just so a little more honest.</v>

10806
05:03:29.850 --> 05:03:31.230
<v Speaker 11>You want to do this style.</v>

10807
05:03:31.410 --> 05:03:32.880
<v Speaker 11>How about I slap you in the face?</v>

10808
05:03:33.050 --> 05:03:33.410
<v Speaker 11>Let's,</v>

10809
05:03:33.410 --> 05:03:33.730
<v Speaker 11>let's,</v>

10810
05:03:33.730 --> 05:03:34.050
<v Speaker 11>let's,</v>

10811
05:03:34.050 --> 05:03:35.400
<v Speaker 11>let's get a little more real.</v>

10812
05:03:35.430 --> 05:03:37.070
<v Speaker 11>Can I knock them out or now you could knock.</v>

10813
05:03:37.230 --> 05:03:41.910
<v Speaker 11>It's called finish only Jujitsu because you can fucking Tko a guy.</v>

10814
05:03:41.970 --> 05:03:42.541
<v Speaker 11>You could knock.</v>

10815
05:03:42.541 --> 05:03:44.190
<v Speaker 11>A guy asked you this or you can finish him.</v>

10816
05:03:44.191 --> 05:03:44.860
<v Speaker 11>Can I ask you this?</v>

10817
05:03:44.860 --> 05:03:45.590
<v Speaker 11>What do I show him?</v>

10818
05:03:45.590 --> 05:03:46.620
<v Speaker 11>What about submission only?</v>

10819
05:03:46.650 --> 05:03:47.790
<v Speaker 11>What about karate chops?</v>

10820
05:03:47.850 --> 05:03:49.590
<v Speaker 11>You allow in chronic chest pump strikes.</v>

10821
05:03:51.360 --> 05:03:52.560
<v Speaker 11>You can kind of,</v>

10822
05:03:52.740 --> 05:03:55.920
<v Speaker 11>you can kind of bring it like it's a palm strike while you're hitting with the</v>

10823
05:03:55.921 --> 05:03:56.820
<v Speaker 11>blade of the hand.</v>

10824
05:03:57.060 --> 05:03:58.070
<v Speaker 11>And if you do that tough,</v>

10825
05:03:58.110 --> 05:03:58.650
<v Speaker 11>you could,</v>

10826
05:03:58.650 --> 05:04:01.440
<v Speaker 11>you could knock fucking people out for sure.</v>

10827
05:04:01.780 --> 05:04:02.160
<v Speaker 11>I mean you,</v>

10828
05:04:02.160 --> 05:04:02.470
<v Speaker 11>you,</v>

10829
05:04:02.470 --> 05:04:02.840
<v Speaker 11>you,</v>

10830
05:04:02.840 --> 05:04:03.370
<v Speaker 11>you really,</v>

10831
05:04:03.370 --> 05:04:08.270
<v Speaker 11>you'd be well served to just ground and pound and drop these karate chops to</v>

10832
05:04:08.280 --> 05:04:09.480
<v Speaker 11>look like bitch slaps.</v>

10833
05:04:09.481 --> 05:04:09.870
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

10834
05:04:09.870 --> 05:04:11.220
<v Speaker 11>because if you're just talking about just,</v>

10835
05:04:11.260 --> 05:04:14.940
<v Speaker 11>or one of the things that boss Rutan showed is that if you can get your hand</v>

10836
05:04:14.941 --> 05:04:15.661
<v Speaker 11>flexibility,</v>

10837
05:04:15.661 --> 05:04:18.820
<v Speaker 11>good boss route and figured out how to pose hands way man.</v>

10838
05:04:19.110 --> 05:04:23.490
<v Speaker 11>And he was fucking guys up by punching like a real punch.</v>

10839
05:04:23.640 --> 05:04:26.220
<v Speaker 11>Like they dropped those palms down on you home strike.</v>

10840
05:04:26.300 --> 05:04:27.180
<v Speaker 11>It doesn't hurt.</v>

10841
05:04:27.181 --> 05:04:29.670
<v Speaker 11>See that's the thing is you can hit shit super hard.</v>

10842
05:04:29.671 --> 05:04:32.640
<v Speaker 11>We don't prompt you break shit with your knuckles.</v>

10843
05:04:32.760 --> 05:04:34.950
<v Speaker 11>It's really almost a better way to strike.</v>

10844
05:04:34.980 --> 05:04:37.650
<v Speaker 11>That could be a problem with a rich hand.</v>

10845
05:04:37.800 --> 05:04:41.610
<v Speaker 11>But we're going to learn as we go and there's going to be some tweaks.</v>

10846
05:04:41.790 --> 05:04:44.430
<v Speaker 11>Big John is very instrumental in all this.</v>

10847
05:04:44.520 --> 05:04:47.250
<v Speaker 11>The commission Cammo it's all legit.</v>

10848
05:04:47.340 --> 05:04:49.340
<v Speaker 11>It's not some Indian reservation shit.</v>

10849
05:04:49.470 --> 05:04:50.700
<v Speaker 11>We're doing it all legit.</v>

10850
05:04:51.000 --> 05:04:51.330
<v Speaker 11>Right.</v>

10851
05:04:51.330 --> 05:04:53.040
<v Speaker 11>And we're going to bring it in slowly right now.</v>

10852
05:04:53.041 --> 05:04:54.780
<v Speaker 11>So we have a 60 man tournament,</v>

10853
05:04:54.870 --> 05:04:59.130
<v Speaker 11>but in between every round we have room for three fights to have a four man</v>

10854
05:04:59.131 --> 05:04:59.700
<v Speaker 11>tournament,</v>

10855
05:04:59.700 --> 05:05:00.533
<v Speaker 11>we need three.</v>

10856
05:05:00.920 --> 05:05:01.770
<v Speaker 11>If there's hitting,</v>

10857
05:05:01.771 --> 05:05:03.570
<v Speaker 11>you have to have commission now because Jiu Jitsu,</v>

10858
05:05:03.571 --> 05:05:04.321
<v Speaker 11>there's no commission.</v>

10859
05:05:04.321 --> 05:05:04.590
<v Speaker 11>Right,</v>

10860
05:05:04.590 --> 05:05:09.180
<v Speaker 11>but do you worry about the commission there to worry about people getting hurt?</v>

10861
05:05:09.390 --> 05:05:10.350
<v Speaker 11>People are going to get hurt.</v>

10862
05:05:10.380 --> 05:05:11.213
<v Speaker 11>Fuck yeah.</v>

10863
05:05:11.630 --> 05:05:12.181
<v Speaker 11>Fuck yeah,</v>

10864
05:05:12.181 --> 05:05:14.460
<v Speaker 11>but you have to have like different kinds of services on hand.</v>

10865
05:05:15.980 --> 05:05:20.980
<v Speaker 11>We have the com now since we're doing this along with the 16 man tournament,</v>

10866
05:05:21.300 --> 05:05:22.920
<v Speaker 11>that regular Ebi rules,</v>

10867
05:05:23.040 --> 05:05:25.380
<v Speaker 11>we're going to have a four man combat Jujitsu.</v>

10868
05:05:25.540 --> 05:05:26.820
<v Speaker 11>We're going to have the commission there.</v>

10869
05:05:26.970 --> 05:05:28.410
<v Speaker 11>There's going to be all the stamp,</v>

10870
05:05:28.890 --> 05:05:33.090
<v Speaker 11>everything that that the commission wants we're doing and we're going to bring</v>

10871
05:05:33.091 --> 05:05:33.360
<v Speaker 11>it in.</v>

10872
05:05:33.360 --> 05:05:34.021
<v Speaker 11>Who knows?</v>

10873
05:05:34.021 --> 05:05:34.980
<v Speaker 11>It could go two ways.</v>

10874
05:05:35.140 --> 05:05:40.140
<v Speaker 11>It could be a complete disaster or it could be fucking something that that</v>

10875
05:05:40.991 --> 05:05:42.070
<v Speaker 11>they're just takes off and,</v>

10876
05:05:42.150 --> 05:05:44.800
<v Speaker 11>and we can't even go back to regular Ebi roles.</v>

10877
05:05:44.980 --> 05:05:47.690
<v Speaker 11>I don't fucking know we're going to go through labor.</v>

10878
05:05:48.400 --> 05:05:49.233
<v Speaker 11>I Dunno.</v>

10879
05:05:49.240 --> 05:05:51.190
<v Speaker 11>I think that it's a good idea.</v>

10880
05:05:51.250 --> 05:05:52.330
<v Speaker 11>So really good idea.</v>

10881
05:05:52.510 --> 05:05:57.510
<v Speaker 11>But I think that to achieve the highest levels of Jiu Jitsu in like the tactical</v>

10882
05:05:57.611 --> 05:05:58.340
<v Speaker 11>sense,</v>

10883
05:05:58.340 --> 05:06:00.070
<v Speaker 11>and I'm thinking you could have too much striking.</v>

10884
05:06:00.370 --> 05:06:03.880
<v Speaker 11>I think as soon as you start throwing wax and slaps in there,</v>

10885
05:06:04.030 --> 05:06:05.110
<v Speaker 11>like a change is shit.</v>

10886
05:06:05.290 --> 05:06:06.880
<v Speaker 11>Because once a guy gets that off,</v>

10887
05:06:07.060 --> 05:06:10.390
<v Speaker 11>you're like all your job is now just to defend against that and maybe you would</v>

10888
05:06:10.400 --> 05:06:11.110
<v Speaker 11>be offensive.</v>

10889
05:06:11.110 --> 05:06:11.590
<v Speaker 11>Jujitsu.</v>

10890
05:06:11.590 --> 05:06:14.200
<v Speaker 11>Why's it important that it's both?</v>

10891
05:06:14.740 --> 05:06:19.740
<v Speaker 11>I think both of us combat you get to is of the focus isn't trying to hurt to</v>

10892
05:06:20.321 --> 05:06:21.280
<v Speaker 11>hurt anybody.</v>

10893
05:06:21.520 --> 05:06:23.080
<v Speaker 11>There will be people that,</v>

10894
05:06:23.290 --> 05:06:24.070
<v Speaker 11>that uh,</v>

10895
05:06:24.070 --> 05:06:28.540
<v Speaker 11>take advantage of the rules and really focus on fucking Baas Rutan Palm Strike.</v>

10896
05:06:28.570 --> 05:06:29.920
<v Speaker 11>There's going to be Tkos.</v>

10897
05:06:30.040 --> 05:06:30.370
<v Speaker 11>It's,</v>

10898
05:06:30.370 --> 05:06:34.140
<v Speaker 11>it's finish also going to be guys that elbow you slap.</v>

10899
05:06:34.740 --> 05:06:36.020
<v Speaker 11>Those are legal and many,</v>

10900
05:06:36.021 --> 05:06:37.240
<v Speaker 11>even if it's illegal,</v>

10901
05:06:37.390 --> 05:06:38.850
<v Speaker 11>if you're going like this,</v>

10902
05:06:39.970 --> 05:06:41.440
<v Speaker 11>they coming down with slaps.</v>

10903
05:06:41.441 --> 05:06:42.274
<v Speaker 11>They might live,</v>

10904
05:06:42.710 --> 05:06:45.580
<v Speaker 11>add that to it and there's not a whole lot you can do to stop that.</v>

10905
05:06:45.610 --> 05:06:48.790
<v Speaker 11>That's going to be considered like a knee on the ground at a toner.</v>

10906
05:06:48.820 --> 05:06:50.530
<v Speaker 11>We're going to treat it this exact same way.</v>

10907
05:06:51.400 --> 05:06:52.061
<v Speaker 11>There might be,</v>

10908
05:06:52.061 --> 05:06:52.680
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

10909
05:06:52.680 --> 05:06:54.010
<v Speaker 11>seems more qualifications.</v>

10910
05:06:54.120 --> 05:06:54.730
<v Speaker 11>Hey,</v>

10911
05:06:54.730 --> 05:06:56.260
<v Speaker 11>it might be a disaster.</v>

10912
05:06:56.300 --> 05:06:56.481
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>

10913
05:06:56.481 --> 05:06:56.690
<v Speaker 11>no,</v>

10914
05:06:56.690 --> 05:06:56.881
<v Speaker 11>no,</v>

10915
05:06:56.881 --> 05:06:57.080
<v Speaker 11>no,</v>

10916
05:06:57.080 --> 05:06:57.450
<v Speaker 11>no,</v>

10917
05:06:57.450 --> 05:06:57.870
<v Speaker 11>no.</v>

10918
05:06:57.870 --> 05:06:59.260
<v Speaker 11>I'm just stay in the elbow.</v>

10919
05:06:59.850 --> 05:07:01.090
<v Speaker 11>Crush day one.</v>

10920
05:07:01.180 --> 05:07:06.180
<v Speaker 11>The plan for 10th Planet from day one was to try to make Jujitsu more effective</v>

10921
05:07:07.900 --> 05:07:08.920
<v Speaker 11>for when their strikes.</v>

10922
05:07:08.921 --> 05:07:11.140
<v Speaker 11>That's always been the plan from day one,</v>

10923
05:07:11.380 --> 05:07:12.213
<v Speaker 11>always.</v>

10924
05:07:12.340 --> 05:07:17.340
<v Speaker 11>And now there's an opportunity to make that just that a reality.</v>

10925
05:07:17.650 --> 05:07:18.760
<v Speaker 11>And who knows?</v>

10926
05:07:18.820 --> 05:07:19.900
<v Speaker 11>Maybe it's a disaster.</v>

10927
05:07:19.901 --> 05:07:20.680
<v Speaker 11>Maybe it takes off.</v>

10928
05:07:20.680 --> 05:07:22.030
<v Speaker 11>I don't know about we're going to do both.</v>

10929
05:07:22.450 --> 05:07:23.410
<v Speaker 11>And uh,</v>

10930
05:07:23.620 --> 05:07:24.160
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

10931
05:07:24.160 --> 05:07:24.730
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

10932
05:07:24.730 --> 05:07:25.990
<v Speaker 11>I just would,</v>

10933
05:07:26.560 --> 05:07:27.490
<v Speaker 11>me personally,</v>

10934
05:07:27.940 --> 05:07:30.520
<v Speaker 11>I think if you add some palm strikes,</v>

10935
05:07:30.730 --> 05:07:34.720
<v Speaker 11>it's gonna make your Jujitsu more real,</v>

10936
05:07:34.990 --> 05:07:36.100
<v Speaker 11>more honest.</v>

10937
05:07:36.430 --> 05:07:38.710
<v Speaker 11>And Not Anna May not,</v>

10938
05:07:38.711 --> 05:07:38.951
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

10939
05:07:38.951 --> 05:07:39.430
<v Speaker 11>there's,</v>

10940
05:07:39.430 --> 05:07:41.110
<v Speaker 11>we're not dealing with striking standing,</v>

10941
05:07:41.111 --> 05:07:41.980
<v Speaker 11>standing combat.</v>

10942
05:07:42.030 --> 05:07:43.420
<v Speaker 11>You have to strike a standing.</v>

10943
05:07:43.510 --> 05:07:44.343
<v Speaker 11>Is this wrestling?</v>

10944
05:07:44.410 --> 05:07:44.651
<v Speaker 11>No.</v>

10945
05:07:44.651 --> 05:07:45.820
<v Speaker 11>Striking at all.</v>

10946
05:07:46.000 --> 05:07:48.490
<v Speaker 11>So this is going to attract three different types of people.</v>

10947
05:07:48.491 --> 05:07:50.320
<v Speaker 11>It's going to attract grapplers,</v>

10948
05:07:50.440 --> 05:07:54.610
<v Speaker 11>Jujitsu and wrestlers that want to eventually transition to the MMA.</v>

10949
05:07:54.760 --> 05:07:57.220
<v Speaker 11>This sport is going to be a great way to get their feet wet.</v>

10950
05:07:57.490 --> 05:08:01.270
<v Speaker 11>Also it's going to take people that have had 18 and a knife fights and they</v>

10951
05:08:01.271 --> 05:08:03.520
<v Speaker 11>realize this is just too fucking intense,</v>

10952
05:08:03.700 --> 05:08:05.740
<v Speaker 11>but I'll do this combat [inaudible] shit.</v>

10953
05:08:05.890 --> 05:08:06.760
<v Speaker 11>This is Tamesha.</v>

10954
05:08:06.820 --> 05:08:07.421
<v Speaker 11>They look at it,</v>

10955
05:08:07.421 --> 05:08:08.940
<v Speaker 11>it's tame lightweight shoe.</v>

10956
05:08:09.070 --> 05:08:10.330
<v Speaker 11>It depends where you're coming from.</v>

10957
05:08:10.450 --> 05:08:11.700
<v Speaker 11>And then there's also going to be,</v>

10958
05:08:11.740 --> 05:08:12.680
<v Speaker 11>there's going to be three,</v>

10959
05:08:12.910 --> 05:08:15.430
<v Speaker 11>there's going to be your third type of person.</v>

10960
05:08:15.660 --> 05:08:20.140
<v Speaker 11>It's just a Jujitsu guy that doesn't want to go and in May at all.</v>

10961
05:08:20.200 --> 05:08:21.070
<v Speaker 11>No dreams,</v>

10962
05:08:21.160 --> 05:08:21.993
<v Speaker 11>never done it,</v>

10963
05:08:22.060 --> 05:08:22.893
<v Speaker 11>no dreams,</v>

10964
05:08:22.930 --> 05:08:23.231
<v Speaker 11>just,</v>

10965
05:08:23.231 --> 05:08:27.700
<v Speaker 11>but would love to take it to the next level because it's obvious if you add</v>

10966
05:08:27.701 --> 05:08:30.400
<v Speaker 11>Jujitsu with some fucking palm strikes,</v>

10967
05:08:30.550 --> 05:08:33.230
<v Speaker 11>it keeps it a little more honest you,</v>

10968
05:08:33.470 --> 05:08:36.740
<v Speaker 11>because when there's no strikes and it's just pure Jujitsu,</v>

10969
05:08:36.741 --> 05:08:37.574
<v Speaker 11>I love that.</v>

10970
05:08:37.730 --> 05:08:38.980
<v Speaker 11>But at the same time you're,</v>

10971
05:08:39.180 --> 05:08:40.370
<v Speaker 11>you're watching shit happen.</v>

10972
05:08:40.371 --> 05:08:41.000
<v Speaker 11>You're like,</v>

10973
05:08:41.000 --> 05:08:41.301
<v Speaker 11>man,</v>

10974
05:08:41.301 --> 05:08:41.571
<v Speaker 11>that,</v>

10975
05:08:41.571 --> 05:08:41.930
<v Speaker 11>that,</v>

10976
05:08:41.930 --> 05:08:44.540
<v Speaker 11>that wouldn't happen in a real goddamn fight here.</v>

10977
05:08:44.750 --> 05:08:47.000
<v Speaker 11>And that would happen in a real God damn fight here.</v>

10978
05:08:47.180 --> 05:08:48.890
<v Speaker 11>So as a fan of the sport,</v>

10979
05:08:49.040 --> 05:08:52.790
<v Speaker 11>as a fan who came in through the UFC to MMA,</v>

10980
05:08:53.030 --> 05:08:56.090
<v Speaker 11>that's what got me into Jujitsu is the fighting.</v>

10981
05:08:56.270 --> 05:08:56.920
<v Speaker 11>So,</v>

10982
05:08:56.920 --> 05:08:57.140
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

10983
05:08:57.140 --> 05:08:57.973
<v Speaker 11>to me,</v>

10984
05:08:58.040 --> 05:08:58.311
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

10985
05:08:58.311 --> 05:09:02.240
<v Speaker 11>it's important that we develop a Jujitsu system or,</v>

10986
05:09:02.270 --> 05:09:06.200
<v Speaker 11>and the sport that goes along with it that prepares you for,</v>

10987
05:09:06.260 --> 05:09:11.260
<v Speaker 11>it's a Jujitsu style combat Jujitsu that will prepare you more for either MMA or</v>

10988
05:09:12.411 --> 05:09:12.681
<v Speaker 11>real,</v>

10989
05:09:12.681 --> 05:09:13.670
<v Speaker 11>like a little more.</v>

10990
05:09:13.740 --> 05:09:14.030
<v Speaker 11>We know,</v>

10991
05:09:14.030 --> 05:09:14.541
<v Speaker 11>and I can look,</v>

10992
05:09:14.541 --> 05:09:18.870
<v Speaker 11>one way you could look at it is like we have boxing than we have kickboxing.</v>

10993
05:09:18.871 --> 05:09:19.040
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

10994
05:09:19.040 --> 05:09:20.000
<v Speaker 11>Then we have more time.</v>

10995
05:09:21.400 --> 05:09:24.440
<v Speaker 11>You have to Jitsu and you have calm attitude to them rather than another level.</v>

10996
05:09:25.040 --> 05:09:29.060
<v Speaker 11>[inaudible] sees the Beth Beth tie over boxing.</v>

11000
05:09:30.501 --> 05:09:31.161
<v Speaker 11>What do I lend kicks?</v>

11001
05:09:31.161 --> 05:09:31.994

11003
05:09:32.660 --> 05:09:33.020

11013
05:09:48.290 --> 05:09:49.670
<v Speaker 11>That's just the same.</v>

11014
05:09:50.420 --> 05:09:53.690
<v Speaker 11>We have two shows coming up that that's not being changed,</v>

11015
05:09:53.780 --> 05:09:56.870
<v Speaker 11>but the first show in 2017 we don't have a date yet.</v>

11016

<v Speaker 11>It's going to be one the one seven to welterweight championship.</v>

11017
05:10:01.280 --> 05:10:04.850

<v Speaker 11>That's going to be regular Ebi roles,</v>

11021
05:10:10.680 --> 05:10:11.120

11022
05:10:11.120 --> 05:10:15.350
<v Speaker 11>combat Jujitsu on the side simultaneously going along with it.</v>

11023
05:10:15.680 --> 05:10:16.870
<v Speaker 11>Who knows how it's going to turn out.</v>

11024
05:10:16.871 --> 05:10:18.650
<v Speaker 11>I don't even know how the fuck it's going to turn out,</v>

11025
05:10:18.830 --> 05:10:20.090
<v Speaker 11>but we got the,</v>

11026
05:10:20.240 --> 05:10:20.451
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

11027
05:10:20.451 --> 05:10:23.960
<v Speaker 11>the support of the camel athletic commission and we're going to do it and we're</v>

11028
05:10:23.961 --> 05:10:25.470
<v Speaker 11>going to w w w it's going to be a,</v>

11029
05:10:25.640 --> 05:10:26.540
<v Speaker 11>we're going to learn from it.</v>

11030
05:10:26.540 --> 05:10:27.230
<v Speaker 11>We're going to,</v>

11031
05:10:27.230 --> 05:10:27.740
<v Speaker 11>cause we've,</v>

11032
05:10:27.740 --> 05:10:27.971
<v Speaker 11>there's,</v>

11033
05:10:27.971 --> 05:10:28.091
<v Speaker 11>there,</v>

11034
05:10:28.091 --> 05:10:29.330
<v Speaker 11>there isn't a sport like that.</v>

11035
05:10:29.331 --> 05:10:32.450
<v Speaker 11>We don't know how it's going to look and where people are going to exploit</v>

11036
05:10:32.451 --> 05:10:34.640
<v Speaker 11>little holes and we're going to have to tweak shit.</v>

11037
05:10:34.850 --> 05:10:35.480
<v Speaker 11>We don't know.</v>

11038
05:10:35.480 --> 05:10:36.530
<v Speaker 11>But the rules are,</v>

11039
05:10:36.710 --> 05:10:39.890
<v Speaker 11>the basic rules are if one guy is on the ground,</v>

11040
05:10:40.340 --> 05:10:44.750
<v Speaker 11>like if you pull guard and you're on their back and I'm standing horse stance</v>

11041
05:10:44.751 --> 05:10:45.320
<v Speaker 11>style,</v>

11042
05:10:45.320 --> 05:10:47.690
<v Speaker 11>I could fucking palm strike you right?</v>

11043
05:10:47.720 --> 05:10:48.500
<v Speaker 11>If I got neon,</v>

11044
05:10:48.500 --> 05:10:49.550
<v Speaker 11>the belly on you,</v>

11045
05:10:49.820 --> 05:10:51.080
<v Speaker 11>I get palm strike you.</v>

11046
05:10:51.230 --> 05:10:53.090
<v Speaker 11>So as soon as it got to be on top,</v>

11047
05:10:53.091 --> 05:10:54.230
<v Speaker 11>you have to be on top on the ground.</v>

11048
05:10:54.770 --> 05:10:56.270
<v Speaker 11>As soon as the guy is grounded.</v>

11049
05:10:56.330 --> 05:10:57.710
<v Speaker 11>Which means if a guy pulls guard,</v>

11050
05:10:57.711 --> 05:10:58.101
<v Speaker 11>he's grounded.</v>

11051
05:10:58.101 --> 05:11:00.470
<v Speaker 11>As soon as one guy has grounded palm strikes.</v>

11052
05:11:00.471 --> 05:11:01.101
<v Speaker 11>Can commend.</v>

11053
05:11:01.101 --> 05:11:02.090
<v Speaker 11>What about when you come,</v>

11054
05:11:02.120 --> 05:11:05.840
<v Speaker 11>you're coming up like say if you go to dogfight and then you get to one knee and</v>

11055
05:11:05.841 --> 05:11:07.610
<v Speaker 11>you pop back up and you both standing up.</v>

11056
05:11:07.730 --> 05:11:11.660
<v Speaker 11>When can you stop striking you when you get to dog fight?</v>

11057
05:11:15.170 --> 05:11:18.560
<v Speaker 11>That's a good question because sometimes you're in dog fight on your knees and</v>

11058
05:11:18.561 --> 05:11:21.710
<v Speaker 11>if someone could just upper cut you boss and style on the face and knock you the</v>

11059
05:11:21.711 --> 05:11:22.430
<v Speaker 11>fuck out.</v>

11060
05:11:22.430 --> 05:11:23.480
<v Speaker 11>Yeah we're going to have you,</v>

11061
05:11:23.481 --> 05:11:25.770
<v Speaker 11>that's a very good question right there in dog.</v>

11062
05:11:25.771 --> 05:11:25.940
<v Speaker 11>Fuck.</v>

11063
05:11:25.940 --> 05:11:29.010
<v Speaker 11>Cause there's dog fight when both competitors are on their knees and there's dog</v>

11064
05:11:29.011 --> 05:11:30.350
<v Speaker 11>fight when they're both standing.</v>

11065
05:11:30.530 --> 05:11:33.990
<v Speaker 11>So just like how Moitai not allowed to kick guy in the head when they're down.</v>

11066
05:11:34.640 --> 05:11:35.250
<v Speaker 11>You know you can,</v>

11067
05:11:35.250 --> 05:11:35.970
<v Speaker 11>you can trip them.</v>

11068
05:11:35.970 --> 05:11:36.770
<v Speaker 11>I can take them down.</v>

11069
05:11:36.770 --> 05:11:40.380
<v Speaker 11>You can't kick him in the head if you're in dog fight at both guys are standing</v>

11070
05:11:40.381 --> 05:11:40.531
<v Speaker 11>up.</v>

11071
05:11:40.531 --> 05:11:41.364
<v Speaker 11>No striking.</v>

11072
05:11:41.370 --> 05:11:44.490
<v Speaker 11>If you had a dog fight and both guys are on their knees or one guy's on his</v>

11073
05:11:44.491 --> 05:11:44.880
<v Speaker 11>knees,</v>

11074
05:11:44.880 --> 05:11:45.713
<v Speaker 11>you can strike.</v>

11075
05:11:45.750 --> 05:11:46.950
<v Speaker 11>It's going to be something like that.</v>

11076
05:11:48.360 --> 05:11:49.830
<v Speaker 11>But really it's all designed.</v>

11077
05:11:50.070 --> 05:11:55.070
<v Speaker 11>It's all designed to make Jujitsu more effective as a martial art because it,</v>

11078
05:11:56.190 --> 05:11:56.661
<v Speaker 11>if it,</v>

11079
05:11:56.661 --> 05:11:59.730
<v Speaker 11>if it works and it takes off and people like it and we do it for 10 years.</v>

11080
05:11:59.731 --> 05:12:01.950
<v Speaker 11>When people are and combat do you get to becomes a sport.</v>

11081
05:12:02.370 --> 05:12:07.370
<v Speaker 11>I guarantee you the champions of combat Jujitsu will translate to MMA a lot</v>

11082
05:12:09.301 --> 05:12:13.740
<v Speaker 11>easier than a champions of other grappling genres.</v>

11083
05:12:13.800 --> 05:12:14.760
<v Speaker 11>In my opinion.</v>

11084
05:12:14.790 --> 05:12:15.571
<v Speaker 11>I could be wrong,</v>

11085
05:12:15.571 --> 05:12:16.950
<v Speaker 11>but it's just like,</v>

11086
05:12:17.120 --> 05:12:18.090
<v Speaker 11>seems like a good idea.</v>

11087
05:12:18.150 --> 05:12:18.301
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

11088
05:12:18.301 --> 05:12:18.870
<v Speaker 11>I like it.</v>

11089
05:12:18.870 --> 05:12:19.291
<v Speaker 11>I like it.</v>

11090
05:12:19.291 --> 05:12:24.220
<v Speaker 11>I like it as a new step from Jujitsu to MMA and die.</v>

11091
05:12:24.660 --> 05:12:25.320
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 11>That's why they want all the goddamned belts.</v>

11114
05:13:12.510 --> 05:13:13.710
<v Speaker 11>So it's a beautiful thing man.</v>

11115
05:13:13.711 --> 05:13:13.970
<v Speaker 11>There's,</v>

11116
05:13:13.970 --> 05:13:16.140
<v Speaker 11>there's a serious war going on.</v>

11117
05:13:16.141 --> 05:13:19.860
<v Speaker 11>It's a friend of the rider friendly rivalry and everyone's improving from it,</v>

11118
05:13:19.861 --> 05:13:20.101
<v Speaker 11>man.</v>

11119
05:13:20.101 --> 05:13:20.580
<v Speaker 11>Every,</v>

11120
05:13:20.580 --> 05:13:20.821
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

11121
05:13:20.821 --> 05:13:24.360
<v Speaker 11>we're looking at what the with John Danaher's don't with them leg locks and man,</v>

11122
05:13:24.420 --> 05:13:27.240
<v Speaker 11>everyone's jumping on that and trying to catch up and word.</v>

11123
05:13:27.360 --> 05:13:32.360
<v Speaker 11>We're knee deep in that leg lock game because of what DDS has done.</v>

11124
05:13:32.700 --> 05:13:36.540
<v Speaker 11>And so you know when you draw DDS DDS,</v>

11125
05:13:37.170 --> 05:13:37.950
<v Speaker 11>they got that,</v>

11126
05:13:37.950 --> 05:13:41.550
<v Speaker 11>they got that leg lock system down like no motherfuckers on the planet.</v>

11127
05:13:41.640 --> 05:13:42.690
<v Speaker 11>You think you know leg lock.</v>

11128
05:13:42.840 --> 05:13:47.010
<v Speaker 11>Oh I think I could defend on Gluck's roll with one of them motherfuckers and see</v>

11129
05:13:47.011 --> 05:13:48.750
<v Speaker 11>if you could defend leg locks up every week.</v>

11130
05:13:48.870 --> 05:13:53.670
<v Speaker 11>So what that's done with what's transpired in Ebi with with the domination of</v>

11131
05:13:53.671 --> 05:13:55.140
<v Speaker 11>the DDS squad,</v>

11132
05:13:55.290 --> 05:13:57.330
<v Speaker 11>it made me realize that damn,</v>

11133
05:13:57.480 --> 05:14:00.030
<v Speaker 11>we haven't been paying enough attention to leg locks.</v>

11134
05:14:00.150 --> 05:14:02.660
<v Speaker 11>So for the last few years who spend a lot of attention,</v>

11135
05:14:02.680 --> 05:14:03.081
<v Speaker 11>I'm like left.</v>

11136
05:14:03.081 --> 05:14:04.490
<v Speaker 11>So all the shit that's going down,</v>

11137
05:14:04.510 --> 05:14:07.320
<v Speaker 11>just making us better and we love the rivalry.</v>

11138
05:14:07.321 --> 05:14:07.951
<v Speaker 11>And you know,</v>

11139
05:14:07.951 --> 05:14:08.610
<v Speaker 11>there's a,</v>

11140
05:14:08.610 --> 05:14:09.710
<v Speaker 11>there's all these little sex,</v>

11141
05:14:09.711 --> 05:14:13.410
<v Speaker 11>there's like the Ibj jam guys trying to prove themselves in sub only.</v>

11142
05:14:13.530 --> 05:14:17.340
<v Speaker 11>And then there's the DDS guys are dominating everybody that fucking up the 10th</v>

11143
05:14:17.341 --> 05:14:18.120
<v Speaker 11>planet guys,</v>
