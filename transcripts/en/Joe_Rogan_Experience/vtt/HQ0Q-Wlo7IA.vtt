152
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.833

<v Speaker 3>Taj things.</v>

156
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:46.864
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the new birth,</v>

157
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 3>but this new film already uncomfortable with this.</v>

158
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.363
<v Speaker 3>Can we go?</v>

159
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 3>So Tommy Burns insisted in shaving a beautiful pattern.</v>

160
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 3>I've worked so hard on that area.</v>

161
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 3>You worked on.</v>

162
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.763
<v Speaker 3>What did you do?</v>

163
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 3>I just grew it out and I sculpted it</v>

164
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 3>all sculpted area vulnerability.</v>

165
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.073
<v Speaker 3>How's it scope?</v>

166
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.400
<v Speaker 3>But what I do is I,</v>

167
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:14.070
<v Speaker 3>I went to a black barbershop and I told them that,</v>

168
00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:15.280
<v Speaker 3>that people might cut my beard.</v>

169
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.703
<v Speaker 3>He taught them,</v>

170
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.280
<v Speaker 3>I asked him,</v>

171
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.113
<v Speaker 3>ask them,</v>

172
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 3>where's the microphone on these things.</v>

173
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 3>I might've had my fucking finger over the microphone on your cell phone is okay.</v>

174
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.940
<v Speaker 3>I hope I don't.</v>

175
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.121
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

176
00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:36.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

177
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It looked good.</v>

182
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 3>So you're sculpting you.</v>

183
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.150
<v Speaker 3>You're not entirely shaving it off.</v>

184
00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:45.984

<v Speaker 1>the dog to me right now we're going to get totally used to it,</v>

447
00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:18.640
<v Speaker 1>but I do suggest you keep the mustache.</v>

448
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a wonderful accoutrement to your face.</v>

449
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

451
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Saskatchewan.</v>

452
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.430
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a duck hunting guide is a totally different person.</v>

453
00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:35.300
<v Speaker 1>So wild to do head shots while</v>

454
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.850
<v Speaker 1>you live at a guy who teaches people how to fly fish.</v>

455
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.210
<v Speaker 1>The guy that knows the difference in a Mallard duck.</v>

456
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.261
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

457
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Less a diver duck.</v>

458
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Totally different kind of meat.</v>

459
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.920
<v Speaker 1>You look how you definitely don't live in your hometown</v>

460
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.240
<v Speaker 1>and you got to Pennzoil Tattoo.</v>

461
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I like this bond a mustache.</v>

467
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Let me see your Instagram.</v>

468
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:11.620
<v Speaker 1>I do think there's something to be said for bringing back a mustache.</v>

469
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a few people who do it and it's a strong look.</v>

470
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.581
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

471
00:14:15.581 --> 00:14:16.271
<v Speaker 1>it looks good.</v>

472
00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:17.770
<v Speaker 1>It looks like they're look stuff up there.</v>

473
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:18.723
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

474
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:19.571
<v Speaker 1>uh Oh.</v>

475
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:20.620
<v Speaker 1>I need to get my teeth cleaned.</v>

476
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.031
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

477
00:14:22.031 --> 00:14:23.140
<v Speaker 1>This just looks sad.</v>

478
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:23.630
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

479
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.751
<v Speaker 1>it looks actually,</v>

481
00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I guess it looks like a guy who lost a fuck ton of weight,</v>

482
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.990
<v Speaker 1>just not to win a competition.</v>

483
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.080
<v Speaker 1>A mustache.</v>

484
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.220
<v Speaker 1>You rock this look and you go back up to two 56</v>

485
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.460
<v Speaker 1>that would be a,</v>

486
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.600
