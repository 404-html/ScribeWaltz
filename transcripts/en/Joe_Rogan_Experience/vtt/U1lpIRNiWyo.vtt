00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.251
<v Speaker 1>You boy,</v>

3
00:00:02.251 --> 00:00:02.840
<v Speaker 1>you fucked up.</v>

4
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Then I could get over is a,</v>

5
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>and this video is how weird are dresses that cross both of their vaginas just</v>

6
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>out there in the breeze.</v>

7
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Strangest dresses that she's got on.</v>

8
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.520
<v Speaker 1>She's got this little station.</v>

9
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>It's draped over the opening of the vagina,</v>

10
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>just so cleverly,</v>

11
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.241
<v Speaker 1>so clever.</v>

12
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Like the parts that we're going to show is right up to the gateway of the vagina</v>

13
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>and then from there there's nothing but a breeze.</v>

14
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Nothing but a breeze and to cross legs and this tiny,</v>

15
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.100
<v Speaker 1>the thinnest possible type of cloth we can make the stiffness lightest.</v>

16
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Most Times seethrough you could see pubic hair right through the fucking thing</v>

17
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>that's there.</v>

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.451
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

19
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>you're getting a little too detailed and it's just weird.</v>

20
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird how women are allowed to do that.</v>

21
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.980
<v Speaker 1>It's so rude.</v>

22
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>No wonder why you alimony laws are in the position they're in.</v>

23
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>We're at a severe disadvantage is by their attire.</v>

24
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.340
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

25
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.010
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

26
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.100
<v Speaker 1>New fucking dangling,</v>

27
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.681
<v Speaker 1>a carrot there,</v>

28
00:00:58.681 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>dangling the carrot.</v>

29
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>It's rude.</v>

30
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>I never realized that it's total drying the chairs and move.</v>

31
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.021
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

32
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>how about the fact they've got shoes on that make their ass do something that it</v>

33
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>never doesn't.</v>

34
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Real life you're leaning forward is if you're just begging for someone to</v>

35
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>fucking doggy style,</v>

36
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>like all day long,</v>

37
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>you're just accentuating your ass.</v>

38
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>You're leaning forward.</v>

39
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:17.694
<v Speaker 1>Like you're just,</v>

40
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 1>you're giving step one to a five step process of doggy style and you're already</v>

41
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>at step one everywhere you go.</v>

42
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Genius.</v>

43
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

44
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't the man who invented high heels?</v>

45
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that a household name that that's the most genius thing?</v>

46
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Because you can get,</v>

47
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>guys will spend,</v>

48
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I put myself in debt buying girls dinner who looked that good and high heels and</v>

49
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>then I then the heels come off and they're back of your house and everything</v>

50
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>else changes.</v>

51
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

52
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.741
<v Speaker 1>aw man,</v>

53
00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 1>that's just somehow that's a huge difference.</v>

54
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean I do see I'm totally different.</v>

55
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:47.970
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't do a damn thing to me.</v>

56
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Really doesn't do anything to me.</v>

57
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it at all.</v>

58
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

59
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>if a woman has beautiful legs,</v>

60
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 1>the legs are beautiful and like if she's barefoot is just as hot</v>

61
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>blocks with confidence and heels,</v>

62
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:07.370
<v Speaker 1>not like those big stripper fuck stiletto things like nights chair.</v>

63
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.463
<v Speaker 1>Nice,</v>

64
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.370
<v Speaker 1>nice high heels.</v>

65
00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:11.540
<v Speaker 1>When you see a woman who was like walks confidently,</v>

66
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying?</v>

67
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like it.</v>

68
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

69
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.870
<v Speaker 1>it is definitely a debilitating,</v>

70
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.201
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

71
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:18.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like a man who's really good at the trap piece.</v>

72
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Save men.</v>

73
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Julia said it's like a man is really good at the trapeze.</v>

74
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.333
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

75
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.080
<v Speaker 1>What skill he's acquired.</v>

76
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.593
<v Speaker 1>Look at her.</v>

77
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

78
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that a woman can have not such a great ass and legs it when</v>

79
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>and if they had the right heels you can get very fooled.</v>

80
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

81
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

82
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.650
<v Speaker 1>It definitely accentuate,</v>

83
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>things come off and you're like,</v>

84
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

85
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 1>well that wasn't exactly what I like.</v>

86
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Lingerie doesn't do shit for me.</v>

87
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

88
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I guess it does.</v>

89
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:44.161
<v Speaker 1>If it looks good,</v>

90
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>it looks good.</v>

91
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.061
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

92
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>but if like,</v>

93
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>is it necessary?</v>

95
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

96
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

97
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.880
<v Speaker 1>I noticed when a woman dresses well and cool,</v>

98
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>like some girls dress really cool in an effortless way.</v>

99
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:54.470
<v Speaker 1>I find that very attractive.</v>

100
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>You're a weird motherfucker.</v>

101
00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're into fashion.</v>

102
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.991
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

103
00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I am turned to the fashion whatever girls showed up at your house with velcro</v>

104
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>shoes on and a fanny pack,</v>

105
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>but she had a banging ass banger.</v>

106
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

107
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't really bother you.</v>

108
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Right me at all.</v>

109
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking about a girl can be in a burlap sack.</v>

110
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.541
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit.</v>

111
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:11.171
<v Speaker 1>Forget that.</v>

112
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>In moments when she was naked,</v>

113
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.181
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

114
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:13.481
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

115
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>I've always been the kind of guy like my friends be like,</v>

116
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:15.831
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

117
00:03:15.831 --> 00:03:16.451
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do that,</v>

118
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't get past her feet.</v>

119
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up you baby.</v>

120
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>There are some feet that really will fuck you up.</v>

121
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:22.901
<v Speaker 1>She could have,</v>

122
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>she could have hooves.</v>

123
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.250
<v Speaker 1>She's got a banging ass.</v>

124
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>If there's an evolutionary thing for that though,</v>

125
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>if someone's got some crazy fucked up feet,</v>

126
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.671
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

127
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

128
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 1>am I going to have to carry you?</v>

129
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm looking for.</v>

130
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Food is going to be a certain point in time where you're not going to be able to</v>

131
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:38.340
<v Speaker 1>make it.</v>

132
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.650
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny you going,</v>

133
00:03:39.651 --> 00:03:40.500
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's true.</v>

134
00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 1>It's 100% what it is.</v>

135
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.521
<v Speaker 1>Cause I do.</v>

136

138
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.880
<v Speaker 1>we're not about her elbows.</v>

139
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 1>I like petite arched feet that I think are an arched foot is very sexy.</v>

140
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 1>A petite foot.</v>

141
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:51.521
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

142
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>

143
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

144
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

146
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.680

198
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.160
<v Speaker 1>What I should say,</v>

199
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.980
<v Speaker 1>stress for these are,</v>

200
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.870
<v Speaker 1>these are not prostitutes.</v>

201
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.480
<v Speaker 1>These are just girls like to dress in style and sexy and that were in these</v>

202
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:15.480
<v Speaker 1>shorts that are just,</v>

203
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.830
<v Speaker 1>there's just a little canopy over your vagina.</v>

204
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.071
<v Speaker 1>I never had that.</v>

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.110
<v Speaker 1>And they have a skirt that like they'll lowered part of their ass.</v>

211
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.100

212
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood.</v>

221
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.150
<v Speaker 1>were talking about,</v>

222
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:54.600
<v Speaker 1>how important it is to keep your mind on the right things in a way.</v>
