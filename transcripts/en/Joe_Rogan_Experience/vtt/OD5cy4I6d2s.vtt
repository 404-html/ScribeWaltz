00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.640
<v Speaker 1>You wanted to be the head of police of Chicago,</v>

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.990
<v Speaker 1>is that still going on?</v>

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.801
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean they certainly,</v>

6
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>the corruption went in and so we can tell that story real quick.</v>

8
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>What they did is they did a national search,</v>

9
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 1>so the laws in Chicago said that this,</v>

10
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.570
<v Speaker 1>appointed police board has to do a nationwide search and then they give three</v>

12
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>names to the mayor.</v>

13
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>The mayor investigates those people and then chooses one.</v>

14
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>So I predicted they weren't going to go with me.</v>

15
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:38.211
<v Speaker 1>I'm too far ahead still that no one's really ready to take that bite yet,</v>

16
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's still something we could have talked about and they would have had the</v>

17
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:41.874
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

18
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.880
<v Speaker 1>I figured they would pick that,</v>

19
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.290
<v Speaker 1>that I figured they'd pick a black guy who was educated and not from Chicago.</v>

21
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

22
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>that was my prediction and that's who the police board did choose.</v>

23
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.330
<v Speaker 1>They chose a guy from Atlanta who fit that bill to the t.</v>

24
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>He was going to be</v>

25
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>the black guy that represents the police department but still totes their line.</v>

26
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

27
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of a word that everybody knows and I'm not saying it so you can all</v>

28
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>pick up on what I'm suggesting.</v>

29
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:13.150
<v Speaker 1>You're saying uncle Tom.</v>

30
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

32
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>and let people have an uncle Tom and he's a nice guy.</v>

33
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 1>So if you have an uncle and his name is Tom,</v>

34
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it.</v>

35
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 1>So that's what they're going to look for.</v>

36
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Something that will have visually a seems satisfying.</v>

37
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

38
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Good instructionally be exactly the same.</v>

39
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>So they chose that guy and the mayor are still said,</v>

40
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

41
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that guy I want you was this guy that didn't even apply.</v>

42
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 1>And that skews the commissioner.</v>

43
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>So who is this guy that didn't imply he was couple ranks down.</v>

44
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm already in the agency.</v>

45
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>He is a,</v>

46
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>he said that he has never seen misconduct or corruption in the Chicago Police</v>

47
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Department and his entire 20 something year career,</v>

48
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.950
<v Speaker 1>he is intimately tied into a cheating scandal and the promotional tests.</v>

49
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Another thing which you could solve easily.</v>

50
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:09.741
<v Speaker 1>So his friends like wife or something got number one,</v>

51
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>the lieutenant's test,</v>

52
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>which is extremely a qualifying.</v>

53
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.923
<v Speaker 1>So say.</v>

54
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.260
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as the information comes down that he actually was the one that was</v>

55
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:24.410
<v Speaker 1>developing the tests,</v>

56
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>had the answers,</v>

57
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:28.380
<v Speaker 1>and then she gets this super high score out of nowhere.</v>

58
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:28.831
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

59
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:29.641
<v Speaker 1>as when everybody says,</v>

60
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:29.761
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

61
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:30.121
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

62
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>we've seen this before,</v>

63
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:31.854
<v Speaker 1>we know what it is,</v>

64
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.941
<v Speaker 1>so you can solve it,</v>

65
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 1>you could retest them.</v>

66
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

67
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.191
<v Speaker 1>And see who does it.</v>

68
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>But at first of course not.</v>

69
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:37.120
<v Speaker 1>So they're not going to do that.</v>

70
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Did they have any interest in exposing things?</v>

71
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm going to come in there and I'm going to say,</v>

72
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.731
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

73
00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:42.031
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

74
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be transparent,</v>

75
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.911
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there.</v>

76
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:45.181
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

77
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>So now when you say that you were a little too far ahead,</v>

78
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by that?</v>

79
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

80
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:55.371
<v Speaker 1>it seems the people of a city or of any area have to be pushed hard enough to,</v>

81
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>to have that change.</v>

82
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Like they have to have that breaking point where they say that's it.</v>

83
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do something different.</v>

84
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Because what I really push is for civilian controlled policing.</v>

85
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I want you guys to tell me what,</v>

86
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.113
<v Speaker 1>what should be done,</v>

87
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge drop in power,</v>

88
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

89
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>that would require a mayor that's willing to give in to the people that have</v>

90
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>pushed hard enough to say,</v>

91
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

92
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to relinquish control of my essential armed wing and I'm going to give</v>

93
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>it to the people,</v>

94
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>and so what's been done before?</v>

95
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Not that I'm aware of,</v>

96
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:31.961
<v Speaker 1>not in America.</v>

97
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:32.561
<v Speaker 1>It certainly hasn't.</v>

98
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>So who's going to be the city that takes that leap?</v>

99
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:35.494
<v Speaker 1>It has to come.</v>

100
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.161
<v Speaker 1>It has to.</v>

101
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:36.994
<v Speaker 1>We all know it.</v>

102
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I've been ranting about a lot lately is choice.</v>

103
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

104
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:41.434
<v Speaker 1>and people this.</v>

105
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>We live in a society that loves to take choice from us and say,</v>

106
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:45.581
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

107
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 1>everything is a disease.</v>

108
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Everything is privilege.</v>

109
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Everything is this thing.</v>

110
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

111
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>you really didn't have a choice because there were these preconceived conditions</v>

112
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.000
<v Speaker 1>and and it really is robbing us of choice because with,</v>

113
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.280
<v Speaker 1>if we accept our inherent superpower,</v>

114
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.101
<v Speaker 1>which is choice,</v>

115
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>then we have responsibility for who we are and if we have responsibility for who</v>

116
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>

117
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>all of us have such a harsh self judge that every failing we have,</v>

118
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.311
<v Speaker 1>if we say,</v>

119
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:09.581
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

120
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:10.414
<v Speaker 1>it was up to us,</v>

121
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 1>the judge just beats us to death about it.</v>

122
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 1>So we'd rather shrug our responsibility and go with our hands up to the judge.</v>

123
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:17.111
<v Speaker 1>Judge,</v>

124
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:17.861
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't my fault,</v>

125
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't my fault because we have such a harsh self judge in our own head that,</v>

126
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>that we intend to do that.</v>

127
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:25.170
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

128
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 1>we give up our inherent superpower,</v>

129
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:30.130
<v Speaker 1>which is choice because we don't want to take the responsibility,</v>

130
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 1>but at any point we can take that back and you have to deal with the judge and</v>

131
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 1>you deal with the judge by making a pact to always forgive yourself.</v>

132
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Forgive yourself for any of the fucked up things that have happened and just</v>

133
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>accept that we're all imperfect.</v>

134
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 1>This idea of perfection is nonsense.</v>

135
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 1>We're all going to fuck up.</v>

136
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:46.900
<v Speaker 1>We're all gonna,</v>

137
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.733
<v Speaker 1>make mistakes,</v>

138
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.080
<v Speaker 1>and so the judge is,</v>

139
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.470
<v Speaker 1>this is nonsense.</v>

140
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

141
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 1>it's like we're all gonna have come to the place.</v>

142
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:53.704
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>

143
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 1>through any variety of channels and we're going to be an imperfect path no</v>

145
00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:58.714
<v Speaker 1>matter what.</v>

146
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.720
<v Speaker 1>So continued to pound that own message of self love and forgiveness and then re</v>

147
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>harness that element of choice so that we can then decide what we want to be,</v>

148
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 1>who we want to be,</v>

149
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:11.950
<v Speaker 1>what we want to go and put our intent.</v>

150
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Fourth and yeah,</v>

151
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 1>and maybe not everything is possible,</v>

152
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:19.621
<v Speaker 1>but what better thing to do than than to fail in the cause of your greatest wish</v>

153
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:22.180
<v Speaker 1>and your greatest intention in your greatest desire.</v>

154
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

155
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 1>that's the ultimate warriors death.</v>

156
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what they would talk about with Vala to find an enemy worthy enough to</v>

157
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:29.290
<v Speaker 1>kill me in battle.</v>

158
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 1>That was the ultimate idea and we can all choose those battles and choose that</v>

159
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 1>thing that we're fighting for and fuck,</v>

160
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:35.951
<v Speaker 1>if we fail,</v>

161
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:36.760
<v Speaker 1>so what?</v>

162
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.800
<v Speaker 1>But at least if we're going out on that way,</v>

163
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 1>we'll go out with a smile 100 percent of the time.</v>

165
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 1>But it starts with really harnessing that choice.</v>

166
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>I've got a bunch of shit for coming against the naked shows.</v>

167
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 1>They do comedy shows,</v>

168
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.271
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

169
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:50.104
<v Speaker 1>Naked shows.</v>

170
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 1>They do these naked comedy shows in New York sometimes.</v>

171
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.540
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

172
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 1>the whole audience is naked.</v>

173
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

174
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.500
<v Speaker 1>just the comics.</v>

175
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.831
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

176
00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

177
00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I was doing this.</v>

178
00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.571
<v Speaker 1>We're doing this thing,</v>

179
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:04.571
<v Speaker 1>this weekend's gang fest for two days for Legion skanks and uh,</v>

180
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 1>at the creek and the cave in Long Island city.</v>

181
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:07.390
<v Speaker 1>And we're having a,</v>

182
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>a naked roast battle.</v>

183
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>I see the novelty in it.</v>

184
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.800
<v Speaker 1>I argued with a girl comic who's talking about like,</v>

185
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>this is about getting over things and you know,</v>

186
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:18.480
<v Speaker 1>there's this artistic back to it.</v>

187
00:06:18.481 --> 00:06:19.314
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

188
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.330
<v Speaker 1>whatever you say,</v>

189
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.351
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you.</v>

190
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Every guy goes there to see pussy.</v>

191
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 1>And she's at her argument was just like,</v>

192
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:27.271
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

193
00:06:27.271 --> 00:06:28.210
<v Speaker 1>like people want to see like,</v>

194
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

195
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:30.350
<v Speaker 1>the social experiment of it and see what I go.</v>

196
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to look at policy and I'm telling you that I am Joe average in my</v>

197
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:35.680
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>

198
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 1>like I am common guy,</v>

199
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 1>but she'll run into a guy who argue against that,</v>

200
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 1>but I don't even go there for personalities.</v>

201
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 1>I like to hear these people talk.</v>

202
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.080
<v Speaker 1>So she came on our podcast with a dude who.</v>

203
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.360

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.470
<v Speaker 1>getting over fears</v>

209
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 2>copies.</v>

210

<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

211
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.333

213
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 1>like backstage with a girl and everyone is like sitting there with your Dick and</v>

214
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.060
<v Speaker 1>pussies out.</v>

215
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

216
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.960
<v Speaker 1>We used,</v>

217
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.190
<v Speaker 1>me and Kurt used to do a Gig in Philly.</v>

218
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.200
<v Speaker 1>It was and where you could do comedy once in a while at a burlesque place called</v>

219
00:07:07.201 --> 00:07:10.160
<v Speaker 1>the five spot or less like a date.</v>

220
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.270
<v Speaker 1>They did dancing with their clothes on,</v>

221
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 1>they get down to the pastries and everything and the,</v>

223
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:16.800
<v Speaker 1>and the goofy outfits.</v>

224
00:07:16.801 --> 00:07:19.710
<v Speaker 1>But me and Kurt would do this once a month.</v>

225
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.673
<v Speaker 1>We'd be like,</v>

226
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:21.870
<v Speaker 1>do comedy on that show.</v>

227
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.101
<v Speaker 1>In between.</v>

228
00:07:23.101 --> 00:07:24.420
<v Speaker 1>The first time we did it,</v>

229
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 1>we were bags and we were blown away because it's,</v>

230
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.440
<v Speaker 1>you never do it.</v>

231
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

232
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:29.130
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

233
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:29.761
<v Speaker 1>don't be weird.</v>

234
00:07:29.761 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Backstage dogs,</v>

235
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:30.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

236
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.740
<v Speaker 1>what's the theater technically so the girls are running around naked know</v>

237
00:07:34.741 --> 00:07:37.740
<v Speaker 1>they're changing so they're just naked a lot and sometimes they would just sit</v>

238
00:07:37.741 --> 00:07:40.380
<v Speaker 1>around naked smoking cigarettes back there,</v>

239
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:41.723
<v Speaker 1>butt naked,</v>

240
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.230
<v Speaker 1>sitting down in chairs.</v>

241
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Pussy all mashed up and me</v>

243
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I'll speak for myself only.</v>

244
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.780
<v Speaker 1>I was just staring at tits and pussy is nonstop.</v>

245
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I just I'll speak for.</v>

246
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I was when he was doing,</v>

247
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.630
<v Speaker 1>I was staring at him and then the next week and the next time he came in,</v>

248
00:08:00.631 --> 00:08:01.650
<v Speaker 1>the next month it was a,</v>

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.850
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to pretend that I wasn't back there to look above what you</v>

252
00:08:08.851 --> 00:08:11.100
<v Speaker 1>want me to force myself to look into your eyes.</v>

253
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.320
<v Speaker 1>If you're that comfortable being naked,</v>

254
00:08:13.321 --> 00:08:14.520
<v Speaker 1>then be comfortable with me staring at you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Buzzy.</v>

256
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:16.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

257
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:17.403
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.250
<v Speaker 1>It should.</v>
