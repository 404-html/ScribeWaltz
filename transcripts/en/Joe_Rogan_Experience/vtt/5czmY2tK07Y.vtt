112
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter.</v>

113
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.001
<v Speaker 1>My household.</v>

114

117
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.030

134
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.510
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately nothing's going to change.</v>

135
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm walking out with the will wrapped around my waist.</v>

136
00:02:41.201 --> 00:02:42.034

00:02:43.991 --> 00:02:44.141

<v Speaker 1>he's getting shot,</v>

142
00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:45.940

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.030
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about him that's unusual?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Other than the size and the strength,</v>

151
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.010
<v Speaker 1>what stands out?</v>

152
00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.080

<v Speaker 1>I guess know.</v>

155
00:02:59.171 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>But I think everyone</v>

157

<v Speaker 2>the heavyweight division mean 260 pound man to a 50 pound man.</v>

158
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:04.744

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

161
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to be hit by something like that.</v>

162
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:08.451
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

163
00:03:08.451 --> 00:03:08.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

164

165
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

166
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.154
<v Speaker 2>I got guys who,</v>

167
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.983
<v Speaker 2>do hard.</v>

169
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

170
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.891
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

171
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:15.724
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

172
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

173
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 2>he just thought he's a little while too,</v>

174
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

175
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 2>that's tough.</v>

176
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.371
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

177
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you can't prepare for that because just there's punches you don't see.</v>

178
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like the punchy Allister with that Wilde took swings wide.</v>

179
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

180
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 2>I think that was a little bit of both on both ends over him.</v>

181
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.630
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

182
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 2>we were just going to be a little sloppy and then just put his face right in the</v>

183
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 2>lane and yeah.</v>

184
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 2>Overeem's got a weird style now.</v>

185
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

186
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 2>It's a different,</v>

187
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 2>it's a totally different style over the last couple of years,</v>

188
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

189
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 2>but he does awkward stuff.</v>

190
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.781
<v Speaker 2>Know,</v>

191
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 2>like when you fought him,</v>

192
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 2>what did you,</v>

193
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.593
<v Speaker 2>how did you feel?</v>

194
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

195
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.521
<v Speaker 2>when I fought him,</v>

196
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 2>he was like very traditional and moving around running,</v>

197
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 2>but like kept yelling,</v>

198
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 2>keeping his distance.</v>

199
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

200
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.880
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

201
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.080
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

202
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.251
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

203
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:54.731
<v Speaker 2>It's a fight.</v>

204
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:55.564
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

205
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.991
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

206
00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:56.111
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

207
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:56.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

208
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 2>he tried that,</v>

209
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.391
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

210
00:03:57.391 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 2>or lunging down what kind of kicked in my thigh and I grabbed it and time it</v>

211
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:02.441
<v Speaker 2>took them down.</v>

212
00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:03.191
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

213
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:03.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

214
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I didn't watch the whole fight with Negan.</v>

215
00:04:05.751 --> 00:04:05.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

216
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.010
<v Speaker 2>but what I saw was he's doing all these wild punches.</v>

217
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

218
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 2>when he fought me,</v>

219
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 2>you're still in the straits and you know,</v>

220
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:11.771
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't really,</v>

221
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:12.604
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

222
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.650
<v Speaker 2>I think was in Ghana,</v>

223
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 2>it was almost like he felt like he could not get hit,</v>

224
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 2>which was correct.</v>

225
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.351
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

226
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 2>So he just decided to be just completely wild and unpredictable me through that</v>

227
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 2>wild lunging left hand to start the fight off and then got the clinch</v>

228
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 2>immediately but wasn't able to do anything with it.</v>

229
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

230
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.241
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

231
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:29.074
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

232
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean I'll find out January 20th thing.</v>

233
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 2>I think I'll be all right.</v>

234
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:33.750
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

235
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 2>I have the best coaches in the world.</v>

236
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:35.720

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.101
<v Speaker 2>Throws hard.</v>

243
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

244
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.280

245
00:04:40.281 --> 00:04:40.690
<v Speaker 2>every way.</v>

246
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

247
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.251
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>

248
00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take much.</v>

249
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

250
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.370
<v Speaker 2>the only time we've seen him on his back was a,</v>

251
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 2>which fight was it?</v>

252
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.120
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] that was Curtis plates took him down.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

254
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 2>That was his first UFC fight.</v>

255
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

256
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.331
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

257
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:53.350

00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

259

<v Speaker 2>You got a chance to see it,</v>

260
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:55.390
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

261
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to see when it guys real young in MMA,</v>

262
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to see a fight from three years ago or whatever that was and then look</v>

263
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:03.221
<v Speaker 2>at him and say,</v>

348
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.600

349
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.860

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Cause that Shin was swelling up.</v>

353
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Heart couldn't leave that like,</v>

00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Austin.</v>

357
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:25.011
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

358
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:25.230
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

359
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't feel right.</v>

360
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:26.181
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

361
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

362
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 2>I could feel like the Russia like blood in my Shin and I'm like,</v>

363
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 2>hmm.</v>

364
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 2>It gives me again am I get checked it and I was like,</v>

365
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.641
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>

366
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:35.211
<v Speaker 2>I got hurt.</v>

367
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:36.044
<v Speaker 2>I got to end this.</v>

368
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.550
<v Speaker 2>So I was like chasing down and finding my opportunity and thank God I got it.</v>

369
00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 2>But it's so interesting that after all these years in Nma,</v>

370
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.660
<v Speaker 2>a new trend surfaces and that trend is the low leg kick,</v>

371
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 2>the low leg kicks to the Shin and the calf area.</v>

372
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.710
<v Speaker 2>It's devastating.</v>

373
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Now you saw it with Benson Henderson,</v>

374
00:06:57.621 --> 00:07:01.340
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the first guy to really bring it to the UFC and really make it a</v>

375
00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:02.480
<v Speaker 2>big part of his arsenal.</v>

376
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.291
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

377
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing it with so many guys now at the low leg kick is just a giant</v>

378
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>

379
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.413
<v Speaker 2>Sucks.</v>

380
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 2>It fucking sucks.</v>

381
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:10.334
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

382
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Well you can't condition that part of your leg.</v>

383
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.753
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same.</v>

384
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I think some people are different,</v>

385
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:15.561
<v Speaker 2>some people,</v>

386
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to be real bad.</v>

387
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:18.770
<v Speaker 2>I think so like for me it sucked.</v>

388
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.461
<v Speaker 2>It was terrible.</v>

389
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:20.750
<v Speaker 2>I go up the stairs after that fight.</v>

390
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 2>It was like the hardest thing I ever just trying to train us.</v>

391
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Look like your leg was broken.</v>

392
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Like it swoll up so quick.</v>

393
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering if you had like uh,</v>

394
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.360
<v Speaker 2>the fibula was cracked or something like that.</v>

395
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

396
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 2>my doctor is actually was super pumped about it cause he can be like,</v>

397
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:32.631

400
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.333
<v Speaker 2>You were so pumped.</v>

401
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.310
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

402
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.001
<v Speaker 2>he's a train with us.</v>

403
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:38.331
<v Speaker 2>So he's a,</v>

404
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:38.931
<v Speaker 2>he's a good dude.</v>

405
00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 2>And he just loved the show.</v>

406
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:40.960
<v Speaker 2>My coach and my coach was like,</v>

407
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:41.091

411
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.430

412
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 2>And he saw the pictures and he's like,</v>

501
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 2>to use my hands better than,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

504
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.000

00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 2>just do go and goes boxing and now here we are.</v>

506
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.233
<v Speaker 2>When did you start?</v>

507
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.793
<v Speaker 2>And then they,</v>

508
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.713
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

509
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:26.263
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago,</v>

510
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:27.743
<v Speaker 2>nine years ago.</v>

511
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 2>That's not that long when you think about it.</v>

512
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:31.230
<v Speaker 2>And now you're the UFC heavyweight champ.</v>

513
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Speaker 2>I took a year and a half off just for boxing.</v>

514
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.703
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

515

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

517
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:38.640

518
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

519

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

523
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Especially coming in with a wrestling background,</v>

524
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.910
<v Speaker 2>but you have an overall athletic background too.</v>

525
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:46.500
<v Speaker 2>Like you paid paid baseball,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

531
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:50.184
<v Speaker 2>I tried.</v>

532
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.241
<v Speaker 2>I tried,</v>

533
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:52.074
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

534
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:52.381
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

535
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:52.630

542
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.000

543
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:02.760
<v Speaker 2>just because of the reaction and the way he uses my hips and stuff like that.</v>

544
00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:03.181
<v Speaker 2>It definitely,</v>

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:33.960
<v Speaker 2>That's how he got his foot work.</v>

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:35.911
<v Speaker 2>His father said,</v>

00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:36.810
<v Speaker 2>do you want to be a fighter?</v>

573

<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

575
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:40.830
<v Speaker 2>you're going to take four years off of fighting and just learn traditional</v>

576
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Ukrainian dancing.</v>

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.001
<v Speaker 2>it's like poetry.</v>

597
00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:09.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

598
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.340
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

599
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:10.800
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

600
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.940
<v Speaker 2>oh everything.</v>

601
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Even body shots like it slides out of the way a body shot.</v>

602
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:15.990
<v Speaker 2>He slides out of the way.</v>

603
00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:19.480
<v Speaker 2>A body shots the way like a Muy Thai guy slides away from leg kicks.</v>

604
00:11:19.481 --> 00:11:19.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

605
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:20.401
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

606
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Like he's just moved so much different than anybody I've ever seen box before.</v>

607
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:24.920
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

608
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.040
<v Speaker 2>well his last four points,</v>

609
00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:28.520
<v Speaker 2>the coaches through the towelette this,</v>

610
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.111
<v Speaker 2>fuck this,</v>

611
00:11:30.111 --> 00:11:30.990
<v Speaker 2>this is terrible.</v>

612
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:31.711
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking that dude.</v>

613
00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:32.280
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

614
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

615
00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:33.903
<v Speaker 2>I want to walk her ring.</v>

616
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.670
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't go around and I'm like,</v>

617
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.720
<v Speaker 2>we'll call it best.</v>

618
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering what,</v>

619
00:11:38.371 --> 00:11:39.540
<v Speaker 2>I think he's one of those guys,</v>

620
00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:40.620
<v Speaker 2>it's like a bar raiser,</v>

621
00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:40.951
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

622
00:11:40.951 --> 00:11:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Like where he's just raised the bar where people look at what footwork is and</v>

623
00:11:44.581 --> 00:11:45.450
<v Speaker 2>they look at that guy and go,</v>

624
00:11:45.451 --> 00:11:46.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

625
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.840
<v Speaker 2>this is not just like moving around a lot.</v>

626
00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Everything's so purposeful.</v>

627
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Like when he turned around them,</v>

628
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.030
<v Speaker 2>when Regati out,</v>

629
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.950
<v Speaker 1>like he put his hand on his head and then spun all the way around.</v>

630
00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:57.460
<v Speaker 1>We're going to,</v>

631
00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:57.761
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

632
00:11:57.761 --> 00:11:59.710
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is going on here?</v>

633
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:00.551
<v Speaker 1>He's a smaller guy.</v>

634
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

635
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:01.923
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

636
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

637
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:03.784
<v Speaker 1>Like mind blowing.</v>

638
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

639
00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 1>because it's not like he got out like struck by a bigger,</v>

640
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:09.220
<v Speaker 1>heavier power puncher.</v>

641
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Now you've got the shitbox doubt about it,</v>

642
00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.401
<v Speaker 1>but he was just pop,</v>

643
00:12:12.401 --> 00:12:12.611
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>

644
00:12:12.611 --> 00:12:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Double Jab pup up.</v>

645
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

646
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.063
<v Speaker 1>it's over here.</v>

647
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:17.703
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

648
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I just like watching that guy.</v>

649
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:19.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

650
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:19.841
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

651
00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to comfortable here.</v>

652
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

653
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

654
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean just it's that guy just,</v>

655
00:12:23.021 --> 00:12:23.790
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm,</v>

656
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy to be alive to watch this.</v>

657
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:27.941
<v Speaker 1>I was there,</v>

658
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:28.774
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

659
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I watch videos and they got all dairy is right there.</v>

660
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

661
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean just the fucking guy barely gets hit.</v>

662
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no one like him in boxing because what he's doing is he standing</v>

663
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:42.670
<v Speaker 1>literally right in front of you and he's unavailable.</v>

664
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he's like dancing all over the place and moving away.</v>

665
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>He's doing some shit and it doing it in a way that nobody else is doing.</v>

666
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:55.021
<v Speaker 1>Like Floyd had lotta shoulder rolls and he's slick as fuck and Floyd stands</v>

667
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 1>right in front of you too.</v>

668
00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:58.060
<v Speaker 1>And He ties people up and shit.</v>

669
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.860
<v Speaker 1>But what Loma Chenko is doing is just some total next level shit.</v>

670
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.573
<v Speaker 1>What he does,</v>

671
00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:06.910
<v Speaker 1>his hand in hand drops.</v>

672
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:07.400
<v Speaker 1>You don't care.</v>

673
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:07.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

674
00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 1>he knows he can get out of the way.</v>

675
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:09.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

676
00:13:09.071 --> 00:13:10.960
<v Speaker 1>He does a lot of very interesting stuff.</v>

677
00:13:10.961 --> 00:13:13.900
<v Speaker 1>But I'm wondering like if we're going to see this in the future now,</v>

678
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:14.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

679
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

680
00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:16.110
<v Speaker 1>obviously when Ali came along,</v>

681
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.970
<v Speaker 1>bunch of guys started imitating Ali.</v>

682
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

683
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:18.511
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

684
00:13:18.511 --> 00:13:19.420
<v Speaker 1>and Tyson came along,</v>

685
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:20.800
<v Speaker 1>bunch of guys tried to imitate Tyson.</v>

686
00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:21.670
<v Speaker 1>You always see that.</v>

687
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:25.750
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how many guys were going to figure out a way to take that to the next</v>

688
00:13:25.751 --> 00:13:26.560
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

689
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

690
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.753
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

691
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:28.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

692
00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I think some guys are going to take it to like not to that.</v>

693
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know if everyone's going to catch that level.</v>

694
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:32.980
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>

695
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.420
<v Speaker 1>well that you know what the next level is that but with like Roy Jones Jr power.</v>

696
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

697
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.030
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

698
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Think if someone figures out a way to move like that with that kind of footwork.</v>

699
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.160
<v Speaker 1>But that one punch,</v>

700
00:13:45.161 --> 00:13:45.994
<v Speaker 1>go to sleep,</v>

701
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

702
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:47.770
<v Speaker 1>knock out power.</v>

703
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.633
<v Speaker 1>That'd be sick.</v>

704
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

705
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.980
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the next level.</v>

706
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully I'm alive for that too.</v>

707
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:54.813
<v Speaker 1>We'll see it.</v>

708
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a amazing time for,</v>

709
00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.020
<v Speaker 1>for all combat sports I think.</v>

710
00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I think the bar,</v>

711
00:14:00.011 --> 00:14:01.570
<v Speaker 1>like I think with all sports,</v>

712
00:14:01.571 --> 00:14:01.871
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

713
00:14:01.871 --> 00:14:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look back at the olden days and you look back at today,</v>

714
00:14:04.421 --> 00:14:05.350
<v Speaker 1>the athletes are bigger.</v>

715
00:14:05.351 --> 00:14:06.370
<v Speaker 1>They don't know how to train better,</v>

716
00:14:06.371 --> 00:14:07.204
<v Speaker 1>they're faster.</v>

717
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 1>But I think anywhere that's more apparent than MMA,</v>

718
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.600
<v Speaker 1>I feel like MMA is like the best example because it's so new.</v>

719
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:13.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

720
00:14:13.901 --> 00:14:14.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll have her send it.</v>

721
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.403
<v Speaker 1>Even like you said,</v>

722
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.290
<v Speaker 1>it's always something always evolving.</v>

723
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:17.531
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

724
00:14:17.531 --> 00:14:17.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

725
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:19.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

726
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.600
<v Speaker 1>like was it John Jones,</v>

727
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.820
<v Speaker 1>you said a teeth to thei think that,</v>

728
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

729
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.150
<v Speaker 1>got a couple years ago and then they started when we started doing it.</v>

730
00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:27.120
<v Speaker 1>And then you're like Benson Henderson doing,</v>

731
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:27.810
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

732
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:28.643
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

733
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.640
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

734
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

735
00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.140
<v Speaker 1>I just love it because it's always evolving,</v>

736
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:32.321
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

737
00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:32.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean you were like,</v>

738
00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.010
<v Speaker 1>you literally cannot take like two months off and if you do it people are going</v>

739
00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:36.844
<v Speaker 1>to pass you off.</v>

740
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:37.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

741
00:14:37.331 --> 00:14:38.320
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting too,</v>

742
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:40.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's different schools of thought,</v>

743
00:14:40.001 --> 00:14:40.271
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

744
00:14:40.271 --> 00:14:44.410
<v Speaker 1>There's like the Aka school where you have all these killers in one room and you</v>

745
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:49.411
<v Speaker 1>have like world champions beaten up world champions and then you have your gym,</v>

746
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:51.430
<v Speaker 1>which is much more specialized.</v>

747
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

748
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.470
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're the big guy to emerge from your gym.</v>

749
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:55.490
<v Speaker 3>And then it's been Jessica,</v>

750
00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:59.060
<v Speaker 3>I and some other high level MMA fighters coming out of your gym.</v>

751
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.260
<v Speaker 3>But that's a,</v>

752
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.090
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of people think that's the way to go.</v>

753
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 3>To have specialized training.</v>

754
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:06.500
<v Speaker 3>Like Max Holloway has specialized training where like,</v>

755
00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:07.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

756
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:07.843
<v Speaker 3>there's not,</v>

757
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.040
<v Speaker 3>you're not dealing with a bunch of people that are already champs.</v>

758
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.270
<v Speaker 3>You're building champs.</v>

759
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:11.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

760
00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:12.460
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

761
00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.900
<v Speaker 2>We're a lot like at my gym is awesome.</v>

762
00:15:13.901 --> 00:15:15.880
<v Speaker 2>Like my coach Marcus Marinelli.</v>

763
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

764
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:17.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like all home grown man.</v>

765
00:15:17.621 --> 00:15:18.940
<v Speaker 2>Guys come in and he just makes them better.</v>

766
00:15:18.941 --> 00:15:19.774
<v Speaker 2>We all,</v>

767
00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.053
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:21.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

769
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:22.440
<v Speaker 2>even like,</v>

770
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:22.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

771
00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't get any specialized training like anyone else.</v>

772
00:15:24.421 --> 00:15:25.121
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't go out,</v>

773
00:15:25.121 --> 00:15:25.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

774
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.100
<v Speaker 2>everything's pushed aside because the guy,</v>

775
00:15:27.101 --> 00:15:27.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

776
00:15:27.281 --> 00:15:27.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

777
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:28.690
<v Speaker 2>like if he's got to fight,</v>

778
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.910
<v Speaker 2>they're going first and then I go,</v>

779

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not better than anyone else.</v>

783
00:15:32.711 --> 00:15:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

786
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.051
<v Speaker 2>I don't look at it that way.</v>

787
00:15:35.051 --> 00:15:35.591
<v Speaker 2>I look at like,</v>

788
00:15:35.591 --> 00:15:35.771

792
00:15:38.841 --> 00:15:38.981
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

793
00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:39.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

00:15:39.161 --> 00:15:39.241
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

795
00:15:39.241 --> 00:15:40.074

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.970
<v Speaker 2>And I was thinking like to come out like a few months later and you guys are</v>

810
00:15:48.971 --> 00:15:49.571
<v Speaker 2>killing it and you're like,</v>

00:15:50.051 --> 00:15:50.320
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

813
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:50.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

814
00:15:50.441 --> 00:15:50.711
<v Speaker 2>we have a,</v>

815
00:15:50.711 --> 00:15:52.300
<v Speaker 2>we have a Kenyan Alexia,</v>

816
00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.340
<v Speaker 2>I two have 500 kids in animal.</v>

817
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.720
<v Speaker 2>Like he keeps me young.</v>

818
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.863
<v Speaker 2>I had to like,</v>

819
00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.340
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

820
00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.160
<v Speaker 2>he just turned pro.</v>

821
00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.370
<v Speaker 2>He was third pro fight.</v>

822
00:16:00.371 --> 00:16:00.701
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

823
00:16:00.701 --> 00:16:01.181
<v Speaker 2>God Dang,</v>

824
00:16:01.181 --> 00:16:01.901
<v Speaker 2>I come in some days.</v>

825
00:16:01.901 --> 00:16:02.734
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

826
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:03.940
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

827
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.720
<v Speaker 3>isn't it an interesting how there's guys like that?</v>

828
00:16:05.721 --> 00:16:06.310
<v Speaker 3>And then Jim,</v>

829
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:07.510
<v Speaker 3>and then for whatever reason,</v>

830
00:16:07.511 --> 00:16:08.470
<v Speaker 3>it never clicked for them.</v>

831
00:16:08.471 --> 00:16:11.500
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some guys that are just so insanely talented,</v>

832
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.800
<v Speaker 3>but they just don't have whatever it is,</v>

833
00:16:14.801 --> 00:16:15.900
<v Speaker 3>whether it's focus,</v>

834
00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:16.240
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

835
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:21.240
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the discipline to keep going when things get weird to just finally</v>

836
00:16:22.031 --> 00:16:23.140
<v Speaker 3>realized their potential.</v>

837
00:16:23.141 --> 00:16:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Like what separates a guy like that?</v>

838
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:30.790
<v Speaker 3>That's like a gym killer from a guy like you who can perform one of the bright</v>

839
00:16:30.791 --> 00:16:31.624
<v Speaker 3>lights.</v>

840
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.073
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

841
00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:35.011
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

842
00:16:35.011 --> 00:16:35.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

843
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.091
<v Speaker 2>when I was fighting,</v>

844
00:16:36.091 --> 00:16:36.520
<v Speaker 2>you got to see,</v>

845
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.710
<v Speaker 2>and I don't mean the whole story here,</v>

846
00:16:37.711 --> 00:16:38.240
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

847
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.190
<v Speaker 2>so I was thinking on fighting.</v>

848
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.470
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

849
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.600
<v Speaker 2>I was like nine,</v>

850
00:16:40.601 --> 00:16:40.770
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

851
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:41.730
<v Speaker 2>I lost the struve and I,</v>

852
00:16:41.731 --> 00:16:41.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

853
00:16:41.911 --> 00:16:43.470
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was unstoppable and it's true of beat me.</v>

854
00:16:43.471 --> 00:16:44.304
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

855
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:45.660
<v Speaker 2>I almost didn't want to fight anymore.</v>

856
00:16:45.661 --> 00:16:45.931
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

857
00:16:45.931 --> 00:16:47.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm ready for this anymore.</v>

858
00:16:47.191 --> 00:16:50.190
<v Speaker 2>And then came back forward and Nelson,</v>

859
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.740
<v Speaker 2>y'all got a couple more fights and then I lost of jds and Lilly when I walked in</v>

860
00:16:53.741 --> 00:16:54.900
<v Speaker 2>my bag and my locker room,</v>

861
00:16:54.901 --> 00:16:55.441
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

862
00:16:55.441 --> 00:16:55.911
<v Speaker 2>I'm down.</v>

863
00:16:55.911 --> 00:16:56.161
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

864
00:16:56.161 --> 00:16:56.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't even care anymore.</v>

865
00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.380
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't even care what happens.</v>

866
00:16:58.381 --> 00:16:58.981
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna go out there,</v>

867
00:16:58.981 --> 00:17:01.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to train and I don't want to do is put it all out there.</v>

868
00:17:01.531 --> 00:17:01.741
<v Speaker 2>But when,</v>

869
00:17:01.741 --> 00:17:03.300
<v Speaker 2>when I'm gonna lose and I don't really care,</v>

870
00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:04.470
<v Speaker 2>it is going to happen.</v>

871
00:17:04.471 --> 00:17:04.970
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna happen,</v>

872
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:05.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

873
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:07.830
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to go out there and get my damn this to win and want to do</v>

874
00:17:07.831 --> 00:17:10.110
<v Speaker 2>whatever we gotta do and I just don't care.</v>

875
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:10.921
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

876
00:17:10.921 --> 00:17:11.390
<v Speaker 3>but some,</v>

877
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.170
<v Speaker 3>so something switched in your head.</v>

878
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:13.411
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

879
00:17:13.411 --> 00:17:15.460
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of see it like when you're doing this,</v>

880
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.020
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I've always said about you,</v>

881
00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:19.590
<v Speaker 3>but when you walk out the fights and during the stare down,</v>

882
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.360
<v Speaker 3>you're like stoic.</v>

883
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:21.990
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

884
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:23.280
<v Speaker 3>you give them dead eyes.</v>

885
00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:24.361
<v Speaker 3>You just like you,</v>

886
00:17:24.361 --> 00:17:25.021
<v Speaker 3>like you're there.</v>

964
00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm an idiot.</v>

965
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:27.091

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.243
<v Speaker 2>anchored.</v>

974
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

975
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:32.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

976
00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:33.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

977
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:33.781
<v Speaker 2>I just stopped caring.</v>

978
00:18:33.781 --> 00:18:34.111
<v Speaker 2>I just like,</v>

979
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:34.941
<v Speaker 2>who cares if I lose,</v>

980
00:18:34.941 --> 00:18:35.551
<v Speaker 2>I lose beyond.</v>

981
00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:36.384
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go out there,</v>

982
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.160
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

983
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm very competitive so I'm gonna go out there and do everything I need to win.</v>

984
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

985
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Randy couture said that once he was talking to young fighters,</v>

986
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:43.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

987
00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.470
<v Speaker 2>saying you can't be worried about losing the people who love you are always</v>

988
00:18:46.471 --> 00:18:47.020
<v Speaker 2>going to love you,</v>

989
00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.150
<v Speaker 2>not going to lose anything.</v>

990
00:18:48.151 --> 00:18:49.500
<v Speaker 2>You're just going to lose a contest.</v>

991
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.850
<v Speaker 2>And if you're to ring into something like a mixed martial arts fight,</v>

992
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.630
<v Speaker 2>someone's got to win and someone's going to lose and you've got to learn from</v>

993
00:18:57.631 --> 00:19:00.060
<v Speaker 2>those losses and you know,</v>

994
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.350
<v Speaker 2>some of those losses,</v>

995
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:05.460
<v Speaker 2>that devastating feeling like I'm sure it was there for you after this true</v>

996
00:19:05.461 --> 00:19:10.290
<v Speaker 2>fight that the rebuild from that is what makes real champions.</v>

997
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

998
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:11.773
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

999
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.210
<v Speaker 2>It helped build them a model that she took my mom there,</v>

1000
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.240
<v Speaker 2>she didn't go to the fight.</v>

1001
00:19:16.241 --> 00:19:17.340
<v Speaker 2>She never seen me fight.</v>

1002
00:19:17.341 --> 00:19:17.940
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

1003
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.450
<v Speaker 2>so you're not,</v>

1004

1006
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1007
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.620
<v Speaker 2>So we're going back into my head like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>someone's going to be there no matter what happens to the Oregon.</v>

1036
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:47.703
<v Speaker 2>Love you no matter what.</v>

1037
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1038
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.320
<v Speaker 2>Your family's always your family,</v>

1039
00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:49.681
<v Speaker 2>your friends,</v>

1040
00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:50.311
<v Speaker 2>always your friends.</v>

1041
00:19:50.311 --> 00:19:50.911
<v Speaker 2>And if they're not,</v>

1042
00:19:50.911 --> 00:19:52.500
<v Speaker 2>they would never really your friends in the first place.</v>

1043
00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.300
<v Speaker 2>You'd probably better off that way.</v>

1044
00:19:54.301 --> 00:19:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's good to have some losses just so you realize who's just going to</v>

1045
00:19:57.241 --> 00:19:57.990
<v Speaker 2>abandon you.</v>

1046
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1047
00:19:58.231 --> 00:20:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Right now it makes sense.</v>

1048
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.133
<v Speaker 2>So do you,</v>

1049
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.270
<v Speaker 2>do you have any mental coaching?</v>

1050
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:03.901
<v Speaker 2>The Do,</v>

1051
00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:04.081
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1052
00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:05.100
<v Speaker 2>do anything like that?</v>

1053
00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1054
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.061
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

1055
00:20:06.061 --> 00:20:07.950
<v Speaker 2>I did for a little bit back in the day.</v>

1056
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1057
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.270
<v Speaker 2>after that.</v>

1058
00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.173
<v Speaker 2>That is true fight.</v>

1059
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.030
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a street.</v>

1060
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.670
<v Speaker 2>I talked to the sports psychologist,</v>

1061
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.780
<v Speaker 2>which it turned into about a minute talking about fighting the next was about my</v>

1062
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:19.300
<v Speaker 2>personal life.</v>

1063
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Had nothing to do with sports.</v>

1064
00:20:20.311 --> 00:20:22.390
<v Speaker 2>It's just really just all it talked about.</v>

1065
00:20:22.391 --> 00:20:22.750
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

1066
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.060
<v Speaker 2>it was just by half an hour.</v>

1067
00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

1068
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.430
<v Speaker 2>I did it a few times.</v>

1069
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.110
<v Speaker 2>I walked there every time and that's when I started getting an entire like,</v>

1070
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.070
<v Speaker 2>why do I care anymore?</v>

1071
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1072
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.990
<v Speaker 2>and stop caring and that and I don't carry more like,</v>

1073
00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:32.400
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>

1074
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.160
<v Speaker 2>what was he trying to cheat sheet?</v>

1075
00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:35.431
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

1076
00:20:35.431 --> 00:20:36.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm a sexist.</v>

1077
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.390
<v Speaker 2>I took immediately as soon as the next person must be a man.</v>

1078
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.080
<v Speaker 2>How could a woman no in anything</v>

1079
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:43.860
<v Speaker 2>such a piece of shit.</v>

1080
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.160
<v Speaker 2>What do you think when you think about,</v>

1081
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:47.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1082
00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.500
<v Speaker 2>like your,</v>

1083
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:49.210
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1084
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.050
<v Speaker 2>that's a critical component in the keeping your mental state together,</v>

1085
00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:53.321
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1086
00:20:53.321 --> 00:20:54.640
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that uh,</v>

1087
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:56.680
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people will talk about.</v>

1088
00:20:56.681 --> 00:20:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Like the having a good support group around you,</v>

1089
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.610
<v Speaker 2>having a support system,</v>

1090
00:21:00.611 --> 00:21:01.211
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>

1091
00:21:01.211 --> 00:21:01.721
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>

1092
00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 2>real loved ones.</v>

1093
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.650
<v Speaker 2>So in her examining that,</v>

1094
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.040
<v Speaker 2>do you think she was trying to like reinforce like what matters and what's</v>

1095
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:09.874
<v Speaker 2>important?</v>

1096
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:10.691
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1097
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:12.400
<v Speaker 2>I never actually thought about it that way.</v>

1098
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.310
<v Speaker 2>She just nosy maybe.</v>

1099
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:15.911
<v Speaker 2>But I've known her,</v>

1100
00:21:15.911 --> 00:21:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I've known her for awhile now.</v>

1101
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.241
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1102
00:21:18.241 --> 00:21:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Like we know.</v>

1103
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:19.440
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1104
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1105
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.351
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

1106
00:21:20.351 --> 00:21:20.751
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1107
00:21:20.751 --> 00:21:21.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1108
00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:21.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1109
00:21:21.731 --> 00:21:22.190
<v Speaker 2>I thought about it,</v>

1110
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.860
<v Speaker 2>but we just started talking and she'd just be like,</v>

1111
00:21:23.861 --> 00:21:26.080
<v Speaker 2>so let's talk.</v>

1112
00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.441
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1113
00:21:26.441 --> 00:21:26.580
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1114
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:26.951
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1115
00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:27.521
<v Speaker 2>talking about fighting,</v>

1116
00:21:27.521 --> 00:21:27.761
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1117
00:21:27.761 --> 00:21:28.061
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

1118
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:28.831
<v Speaker 2>this and that.</v>

1119
00:21:28.831 --> 00:21:29.664
<v Speaker 2>And then I'd be like,</v>

1120
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:29.970
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1121
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:31.980
<v Speaker 2>I got my girlfriend into the girl at the town was loose,</v>

1122
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.250
<v Speaker 2>she's doing this then it,</v>

1123
00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:33.680
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1124
00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.513
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

1125
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:36.643
<v Speaker 2>she likes,</v>

1126
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.903
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1127
00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>

1128
00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:39.941
<v Speaker 2>But with lily,</v>

1129
00:21:39.941 --> 00:21:40.541
<v Speaker 2>I walked down,</v>

1130
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I felt like so much better and not even just because of the financial,</v>

1131
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.480
<v Speaker 2>I think it needed to clear all our stuff out.</v>

1132
00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Just needed like mine straight.</v>

1133
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.000
<v Speaker 2>They say that for people to go to shrinks.</v>

1134
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go to a psychiatrist,</v>

1135
00:21:50.801 --> 00:21:51.371
<v Speaker 2>I never gone.</v>

1136
00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:53.950
<v Speaker 2>But if you go like the best thing is just to talk about it.</v>

1137
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Like most people just keep things bottled up inside.</v>

1138
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.930
<v Speaker 2>They don't have anybody to talk to about a lot of the shit that's going on</v>

1139
00:21:58.931 --> 00:21:59.764
<v Speaker 2>inside their head.</v>

1140
00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:00.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1141
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.660
<v Speaker 2>That was my problem when I was younger actually.</v>

1142
00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:01.960

1145
00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.930
<v Speaker 2>one thing that made us better was that I communicate because I was like,</v>

1146
00:22:07.931 --> 00:22:08.561
<v Speaker 2>she'd get mad at me,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I actually had two departments.</v>

1181
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.541
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1182
00:22:41.541 --> 00:22:41.781
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1183
00:22:41.781 --> 00:22:41.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1184
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:42.783
<v Speaker 2>but just uh,</v>

1185
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:43.401
<v Speaker 2>he's just tough.</v>

1186
00:22:43.401 --> 00:22:44.210
<v Speaker 2>It can be in full time.</v>

1187
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1188
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.580
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get hired full time so I couldn't be tough to do both.</v>

1189
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:49.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1190
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.530
<v Speaker 2>if I did before I'd be a lot easier.</v>

1191
00:22:50.531 --> 00:22:53.680
<v Speaker 2>But I can't just take a test because you have to probation and year long and</v>

1192
00:22:53.681 --> 00:22:54.251
<v Speaker 2>then you can't.</v>

1193
00:22:54.251 --> 00:22:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1194
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:55.960
<v Speaker 2>So while you're fighting,</v>

1195
00:22:55.961 --> 00:22:56.980
<v Speaker 2>you work part time.</v>

1196
00:22:56.981 --> 00:22:58.840
<v Speaker 2>And do you have it set up where you know,</v>

1197
00:22:58.841 --> 00:23:00.100
<v Speaker 2>like you tell them in advance like,</v>

1198
00:23:00.101 --> 00:23:00.311
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1199
00:23:00.311 --> 00:23:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I got a January 20th fight.</v>

1200
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.273
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1201
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.600
<v Speaker 2>I already picked my schedule.</v>

1202
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:06.790
<v Speaker 2>So a month in advance,</v>

1203
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:11.170
<v Speaker 2>like one station and I pick it within the first week I picked my whole the whole</v>

1204
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.930
<v Speaker 2>month and then the next station we go like,</v>

1205
00:23:13.931 --> 00:23:14.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1206
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.033
<v Speaker 2>seniority.</v>

1207
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.440
<v Speaker 2>So when I come up I pick my schedule so I make sure that,</v>

1208
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:18.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1209
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.211
<v Speaker 2>it's when he picked out.</v>

1210
00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:24.190
<v Speaker 2>So I really work by five times in about two weeks now.</v>

1211
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:24.880
<v Speaker 2>12 hour shift.</v>

1212
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.530
<v Speaker 2>How much does that get in the way you're training?</v>

1213
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

1214
00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:27.850
<v Speaker 2>Never?</v>

1215
00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

1216
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:29.163
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1217
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.273
<v Speaker 2>How's that work?</v>

1218
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:31.990
<v Speaker 2>Just because the way I picked my schedule,</v>

1219
00:23:31.991 --> 00:23:32.411
<v Speaker 2>if I had to do,</v>

1220
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:36.430
<v Speaker 2>I could trade someone and someone's coming in and make it work and they're,</v>

1221
00:23:36.431 --> 00:23:36.670
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1222
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:37.570
<v Speaker 2>they're amazing people.</v>

1223
00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Both stations were amazing.</v>

1224
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:39.221
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1225
00:23:39.221 --> 00:23:40.090
<v Speaker 2>the chiefs are great.</v>

1226
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.361
<v Speaker 2>The guys that worked that,</v>

1227
00:23:41.361 --> 00:23:43.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean actually a lot of them are coming to the fight.</v>

1228
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Jerry touring this song.</v>

1229
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:45.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Well that's</v>

1231
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:46.281
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1232
00:23:46.281 --> 00:23:49.310
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting thing about firefighters is that a lot of times you get</v>

1233
00:23:49.311 --> 00:23:50.900
<v Speaker 1>those 24 hour shifts,</v>

1234
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:51.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1235
00:23:51.561 --> 00:23:52.130
<v Speaker 1>and where,</v>

1236
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:52.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1237
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:53.780
<v Speaker 1>you get a chance to work out,</v>

1238
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:54.643
<v Speaker 1>you can cook,</v>

1239
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:55.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1240
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:56.600
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with guys.</v>

1241
00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:57.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like once the,</v>

1242
00:23:57.531 --> 00:23:59.120
<v Speaker 1>the duties are done around the firehouse,</v>

1243
00:23:59.121 --> 00:23:59.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1244
00:23:59.540 --> 00:23:59.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1245
00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:01.100
<v Speaker 1>I play a lot of call of duty two.</v>

1246
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:01.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1247
00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:04.850
<v Speaker 1>They're losing a 10 year old kid.</v>

1248
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy job because when,</v>

1249
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.230
<v Speaker 1>when you have to do something,</v>

1250
00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:12.680
<v Speaker 1>what you have to do is so extreme and what's demanded of you is just insane.</v>

1251
00:24:12.681 --> 00:24:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm sure you've been paying attention to what's going on just a few miles</v>

1252
00:24:15.831 --> 00:24:17.420
<v Speaker 1>from here in Ventura.</v>

1253
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.780
<v Speaker 1>It's out of control nor,</v>

1254
00:24:18.781 --> 00:24:21.020
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy is that we just went past,</v>

1255
00:24:21.021 --> 00:24:23.970
<v Speaker 1>there was at Getty Boulevard Getty Center.</v>

1256
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:25.640
<v Speaker 1>It looked like it was like,</v>

1257
00:24:25.641 --> 00:24:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm forgetting and then we just pass it today and it was like burnt,</v>

1258
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1259
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:29.571
<v Speaker 1>it was not,</v>

1260
00:24:29.571 --> 00:24:30.440
<v Speaker 1>it's like a couple of days ago.</v>

1261
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.211
<v Speaker 1>That's what it will look like.</v>

1262
00:24:31.211 --> 00:24:32.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like shocking.</v>

1263
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Well La is a fucking mess.</v>

1264
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:34.911
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1265
00:24:34.911 --> 00:24:38.300
<v Speaker 1>the beautiful thing about California is we don't have any weather in it never</v>

1266
00:24:38.301 --> 00:24:38.631
<v Speaker 1>rains.</v>

1267
00:24:38.631 --> 00:24:41.780
<v Speaker 1>But the terrible thing is once it gets crispy and the other night,</v>

1268
00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:41.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1269
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:43.220
<v Speaker 1>when this was all happening,</v>

1270
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:43.701
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1271
00:24:43.701 --> 00:24:46.200
<v Speaker 1>I was at my house and the wind was blowing like we did.</v>

1272
00:24:46.201 --> 00:24:49.880
<v Speaker 1>They were calling it a dry hurricane because the wind was so crazy.</v>

1273
00:24:49.881 --> 00:24:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Trees were falling down all over the place and the thought was,</v>

1274
00:24:52.911 --> 00:24:53.330
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1275
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.920
<v Speaker 1>if a fire gets lit here,</v>

1276
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:55.993
<v Speaker 1>we're fucked.</v>

1277
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.721
<v Speaker 1>And then boom,</v>

1278
00:24:56.721 --> 00:24:57.620
<v Speaker 1>they start popping up.</v>

1279
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:59.570
<v Speaker 1>There was a natural like from different,</v>

1280
00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:00.423
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1281
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:01.633
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1282
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of psychos out there.</v>

1283
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of fucking people that recognize these are crazy fire</v>

1284
00:25:06.951 --> 00:25:08.510
<v Speaker 1>conditions and they just want a light,</v>

1285
00:25:08.511 --> 00:25:09.350
<v Speaker 1>something on fire.</v>

1286
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:10.970
<v Speaker 1>And they do and they step away.</v>

1287
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.170
<v Speaker 1>And then next thing you know,</v>

1288
00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:14.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a 300,000 acre fire.</v>

1289
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.290
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1290
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.730
<v Speaker 1>There's accidents for sure.</v>

1291
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.210
<v Speaker 1>But I think for sure some of this is arson within a day or two.</v>

1292
00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.053
<v Speaker 1>All those ones.</v>

1293
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.131
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of,</v>

1294
00:25:22.131 --> 00:25:22.964
<v Speaker 1>how is that possible?</v>

1295
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1296
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:25.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of fucking psychos out there.</v>

1297
00:25:25.641 --> 00:25:26.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

1298
00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I think there's definitely some accidents and obviously those wins exacerbate</v>

1299
00:25:30.891 --> 00:25:32.390
<v Speaker 1>anything that would have been a small fire.</v>

1300
00:25:32.391 --> 00:25:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a small fire in my neighborhood a couple of months ago,</v>

1301
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:36.620
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't winning.</v>

1302
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.840
<v Speaker 1>The firefighters jumped on it quick and they put the house down.</v>

1303
00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1304
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:40.423
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

1305
00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:42.260
<v Speaker 1>when the winds were the way they were,</v>

1306
00:25:42.261 --> 00:25:44.420
<v Speaker 1>when you were having chunks of embers that were flying six,</v>

1307
00:25:44.421 --> 00:25:45.620
<v Speaker 1>700 yards away,</v>

1308
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:46.730
<v Speaker 1>flying through the air,</v>

1309
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.900
<v Speaker 1>this and that and everywhere,</v>

1310
00:25:47.901 --> 00:25:49.250
<v Speaker 1>there was no way they can stay on top of it.</v>

1311
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:50.190
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1312
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.840
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1313
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.770
<v Speaker 1>that's like scary.</v>

1314
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.220
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1315
00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:52.780
<v Speaker 1>They're fine.</v>

1316
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1317
00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:53.271
<v Speaker 1>we don't want,</v>

1318
00:25:53.271 --> 00:25:53.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1319
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:54.770
<v Speaker 1>we have like brush fires.</v>

1320
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:55.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1321
00:25:55.521 --> 00:25:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a good thing about Ohio.</v>

1322

<v Speaker 1>we actually have friends in San Diego.</v>

1348
00:26:19.431 --> 00:26:21.080
<v Speaker 1>They had to get evacuated.</v>

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.620
<v Speaker 1>He said there was 85% chance that their house would be be be gone.</v>

1350
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:25.201
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

00:26:32.901 --> 00:26:33.321

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1363
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:38.450
<v Speaker 1>part of it's like cleansing.</v>

1364
00:26:38.451 --> 00:26:38.621
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1365
00:26:38.621 --> 00:26:40.340
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff in your house is not you.</v>

1366
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.080
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking TV or your clothes.</v>

1367
00:26:42.081 --> 00:26:42.651
<v Speaker 1>That's not you.</v>

1368
00:26:42.651 --> 00:26:42.840
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1369
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.270
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 1>you'll be all right.</v>

1372
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Which I listen,</v>

1373
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.600
<v Speaker 2>I always buy a new one.</v>

1374
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:45.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1375
00:26:45.961 --> 00:26:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking stay with your grandmother for a while.</v>

1376
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:49.283
<v Speaker 2>You'd be fine.</v>

1377
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Everybody live.</v>

1378
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:52.530
<v Speaker 2>As long as you get out,</v>

1379
00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:53.130
<v Speaker 2>you're all right.</v>

1380
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:54.990
<v Speaker 2>You'll be able to rebuild and get back.</v>

1381
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:55.950
<v Speaker 2>It's sometimes it's a,</v>

1382
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:56.401
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1383
00:26:56.401 --> 00:26:58.890
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good thing to lose everything that you work for,</v>

1384
00:26:58.891 --> 00:27:01.500
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's a good thing to know that you are vulnerable,</v>

1385
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:02.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1386
00:27:02.191 --> 00:27:02.761
<v Speaker 2>like in these,</v>

1387
00:27:02.761 --> 00:27:03.481
<v Speaker 2>these fires,</v>

1388
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:07.200
<v Speaker 2>like I think it's one thing that La is missing is um,</v>

1389
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.420
<v Speaker 2>humility that's brought on by the weather.</v>

1390
00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:10.261
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

1391
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:13.860
<v Speaker 2>you know how it is an in Cleveland when it fucking snow's right when it snows</v>

1392
00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:15.780
<v Speaker 2>out and it's thick.</v>

1393
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.930
<v Speaker 2>There's that feeling in the air where everybody calms down.</v>

1394
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1395
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's like,</v>

1396
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.210
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1397
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.180
<v Speaker 2>like there's no one driving like a fucking crazy psychopath when it's snow.</v>

1398
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's going real,</v>

1399
00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:26.700
<v Speaker 2>kind of slow,</v>

1400
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:27.570
<v Speaker 2>slow and steady.</v>

1401
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.430
<v Speaker 2>Your back tires are kicking out a little bit.</v>

1402
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.211
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1403
00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:31.044
<v Speaker 2>Like that,</v>

1404
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.340
<v Speaker 2>that keeps people humble.</v>

1405
00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:28:42.601 --> 00:28:43.261
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

1469
00:28:43.261 --> 00:28:43.690
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>

1470
00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:43.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1471
00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:44.391
<v Speaker 2>you said it's,</v>

1472
00:28:44.391 --> 00:28:45.211
<v Speaker 2>it's humbling because you know,</v>

1473
00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:46.021
<v Speaker 2>you're not safe.</v>

1474
00:28:46.021 --> 00:28:47.370
<v Speaker 2>So I believe we can find out that the,</v>

1475
00:28:47.371 --> 00:28:48.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1476
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:49.410
<v Speaker 2>generated and working on that we're getting,</v>

1477
00:28:49.411 --> 00:28:50.720
<v Speaker 2>because it actually worked in their day,</v>

1478
00:28:50.721 --> 00:28:51.090
<v Speaker 2>the power,</v>

1479
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:53.730
<v Speaker 2>and it was so windy that the power went out and actually kicked down.</v>

1480
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:53.941
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1481
00:28:53.941 --> 00:28:54.721
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1482

1483
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.610
<v Speaker 2>that's comforting about hearing that.</v>

1484
00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.500

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.153

00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:25.550
<v Speaker 2>I think that it keeps me grounded because,</v>

1867
00:35:25.551 --> 00:35:26.384
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

00:35:26.721 --> 00:35:27.710
<v Speaker 2>we don't always talk about fighting,</v>

1870
00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:27.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1873
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:32.150
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we're worried about the worry about funding this Nacuso mine</v>

1874
00:35:32.151 --> 00:35:32.631
<v Speaker 2>off of it,</v>

1875
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:33.230

1876
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1877

<v Speaker 1>You just never know.</v>

1883
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:40.830
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you keep the job.</v>

2150
00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:38.860
<v Speaker 1>you would seriously develop some like real power in your,</v>

2151
00:40:38.861 --> 00:40:40.060
<v Speaker 1>in your movements and your,</v>

00:40:40.061 --> 00:40:41.320
<v Speaker 1>your ability to push off.</v>

2153
00:40:41.321 --> 00:40:44.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think for striking that would be fucking incredible.</v>

2154
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:45.124
<v Speaker 1>That thing.</v>

2155

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2156
00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I dude,</v>

2157
00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:47.560
<v Speaker 1>yesterday I did three,</v>

2158
00:40:47.561 --> 00:40:48.400
<v Speaker 1>five minute rounds,</v>

2159
00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:48.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2160
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:49.690
<v Speaker 1>to 90.</v>

2161
00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:51.880
<v Speaker 1>So do you a shadowbox while you're doing that?</v>

2162
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:52.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2163
00:40:52.121 --> 00:40:52.811
<v Speaker 1>it depends what I do.</v>

2164
00:40:52.811 --> 00:40:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I a little shove out of the first one I did marching and I slide back and forth</v>

2165
00:40:55.901 --> 00:40:56.530
<v Speaker 1>just a little bit.</v>

2166
00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:56.791
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

2167
00:40:56.791 --> 00:40:57.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2168
00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.211
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda funny,</v>

2169
00:40:58.211 --> 00:41:00.550
<v Speaker 1>but actually grabbed the bar and I thrust my hips,</v>

2170
00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:03.430
<v Speaker 1>works my hips and have to do my lower back.</v>

2171
00:41:03.431 --> 00:41:07.110
<v Speaker 1>And then next time we did a with squat medicine ball,</v>

2172
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.410
<v Speaker 1>throw it to one coach squat,</v>

2173
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.580
<v Speaker 1>throw it back back and forth,</v>

2174
00:41:09.581 --> 00:41:10.061
<v Speaker 1>five minutes.</v>

2175
00:41:10.061 --> 00:41:11.830
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll know when I like bourbons,</v>

2176
00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:13.480
<v Speaker 1>keep me on just counting,</v>

2177
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:14.890
<v Speaker 1>keep moving a little bit like that.</v>

2178
00:41:14.891 --> 00:41:18.130
<v Speaker 1>And then you evolve this over over time.</v>

2179
00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:18.791
<v Speaker 1>And we have,</v>

2180
00:41:18.791 --> 00:41:19.624
<v Speaker 1>we actually have a,</v>

2181
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:21.130
<v Speaker 1>put it back up again.</v>

2182
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:25.130
<v Speaker 1>We used to have a medicine ball that was strapped up and be like a more Thai</v>

2183
00:41:25.131 --> 00:41:25.964
<v Speaker 1>clinch.</v>

2184
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:26.860
<v Speaker 1>It's we did that,</v>

2185
00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:27.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2186
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:28.000
<v Speaker 1>the five minutes.</v>

2187
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:28.540
<v Speaker 1>That was hard.</v>

2188
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:29.291
<v Speaker 1>That was terrible.</v>

2189
00:41:29.291 --> 00:41:32.550
<v Speaker 1>And so that was actually not funded all we did that and then we had like um,</v>

2190
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:33.650
<v Speaker 1>these massive like</v>

2191
00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:36.010
<v Speaker 2>on what the weather,</v>

2192
00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:41.010
<v Speaker 2>I almost like part of a boat but there's these big metal rings like Oval Rings</v>

2193
00:41:41.241 --> 00:41:41.930
<v Speaker 2>and their Chin.</v>

2194
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:42.161
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2195
00:41:42.161 --> 00:41:44.870
<v Speaker 2>we just sit there and just lock her like this and keep your hands up high and</v>

2196
00:41:44.871 --> 00:41:45.460
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2197
00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 2>just working on,</v>

2198
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:47.210
<v Speaker 2>keep your hands up.</v>

2199
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Plus we put it for the Max in that you're a veteran max?</v>

2200
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.671
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2201
00:41:49.671 --> 00:41:50.391
<v Speaker 2>what's the Virta Mac?</v>

2202
00:41:50.391 --> 00:41:51.290
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

2203
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:52.183
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2204
00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:53.900
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>

2205
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:54.950
<v Speaker 2>it's like a platform.</v>

2206
00:41:54.951 --> 00:41:57.160
<v Speaker 2>The platform has got all the straps number,</v>

2207
00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.113
<v Speaker 2>I'll resistance.</v>

2208
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:59.271
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>

2209
00:41:59.271 --> 00:41:59.930
<v Speaker 2>So you can jump,</v>

2210
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:00.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2211
00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:01.280
<v Speaker 2>punching.</v>

2212
00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:01.551
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2213
00:42:01.551 --> 00:42:01.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2214
00:42:01.881 --> 00:42:02.330
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

2215
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:03.740
<v Speaker 2>I think I have seen that before.</v>

2216
00:42:03.741 --> 00:42:07.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like it strapped up to different parts of your body so he could throw knees</v>

2217
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.590
<v Speaker 2>and punches and kicks and stuff like that.</v>

2218
00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:09.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2219
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:11.000
<v Speaker 2>We had that to that.</v>

2220
00:42:11.001 --> 00:42:12.470
<v Speaker 2>So it's a pretty interesting,</v>

2221
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:13.880
<v Speaker 2>and you do operate on Brown's,</v>

2222
00:42:13.881 --> 00:42:14.720
<v Speaker 2>you do rounds?</v>

2223
00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:15.440
<v Speaker 2>We've done that.</v>

2224
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.160
<v Speaker 2>I've been around.</v>

2225
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2226
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.850
<v Speaker 2>So like when we go back and forth with that and stuff like they can want to be,</v>

2227
00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:23.170
<v Speaker 2>I want to have you on when then when resistance and Dah Dah Dah.</v>

2228
00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.013
<v Speaker 2>So are they,</v>

2229
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.760
<v Speaker 2>do they monitor your heart rate?</v>

2230
00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2231
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.900
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2232
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:27.950
<v Speaker 2>I just pushed to the limit.</v>

2233
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:29.323
<v Speaker 2>I don't worry about it.</v>

2234
00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:29.811
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2235
00:42:29.811 --> 00:42:32.630
<v Speaker 2>like I do listen to my body if I'm tired of 'em are struggling,</v>

2236
00:42:32.631 --> 00:42:33.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2237
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.790
<v Speaker 2>like the last camp for Jds camp,</v>

2238
00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:35.571
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I was thinking,</v>

2239
00:42:35.571 --> 00:42:36.404
<v Speaker 2>but I did like,</v>

2240

2261
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:01.760
<v Speaker 2>like a major championship fight?</v>

<v Speaker 2>How do you know when you're peaking?</v>

2266
00:43:08.301 --> 00:43:10.700
<v Speaker 2>When to back off every fight?</v>

2267
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2268
00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.620
<v Speaker 2>two weeks out I stopped swearing.</v>

2269
00:43:12.621 --> 00:43:13.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't spark two weeks before a fight.</v>

2270
00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:14.451
<v Speaker 2>Two weeks,</v>

2271
00:43:14.451 --> 00:43:14.990
<v Speaker 2>two weeks.</v>

2272
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

2273
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:16.610
<v Speaker 2>Just my body rest.</v>

2302
00:43:52.431 --> 00:43:52.791
<v Speaker 2>Like mad,</v>

2303

2304
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2308
00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.050
<v Speaker 2>It's what I've always done.</v>

2309
00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.400
<v Speaker 2>It feels right for me.</v>

2310
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.010
<v Speaker 2>I can keep puts his mind in a good place,</v>

2311
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:04.820
<v Speaker 2>I guess too.</v>

2312
00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2313
00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:06.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

2314
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:06.801
<v Speaker 2>that's old school,</v>

2315
00:44:06.801 --> 00:44:07.634
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2316
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:08.530
<v Speaker 2>For him though,</v>

2317
00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:10.660
<v Speaker 2>he worked for him of all time.</v>

2318
00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2319
00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:11.973
<v Speaker 2>no doubt.</v>

2320
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:17.390
<v Speaker 2>But I talked to another coach who said that when he was competing that what he</v>

2321
00:44:17.391 --> 00:44:19.940
<v Speaker 2>would do is the last week of the fight,</v>

2322
00:44:19.941 --> 00:44:21.350
<v Speaker 2>he literally wouldn't do anything.</v>

2323
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.341
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2324
00:44:22.341 --> 00:44:23.390
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't work out at all.</v>

2325
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.661
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2326
00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:24.380
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

2327
00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.101
<v Speaker 2>He is nothing.</v>

2328
00:44:25.101 --> 00:44:25.791
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't my ride,</v>

2329
00:44:25.791 --> 00:44:26.600
<v Speaker 2>my bike.</v>

2330
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:26.811
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2331
00:44:26.811 --> 00:44:28.550
<v Speaker 2>I might swim a little bit because I don't do shit.</v>

2332
00:44:28.551 --> 00:44:28.701
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2333
00:44:28.701 --> 00:44:29.600
<v Speaker 2>I already know how to fight.</v>

2334
00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:30.740
<v Speaker 2>It was Marty and shape.</v>

2335
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:31.020
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2336
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:31.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to recover.</v>

2337
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:32.701
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

2338
00:44:32.701 --> 00:44:35.520
<v Speaker 2>and you think about it like if you haven't worked out in a week when you go and</v>

2339
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:35.971
<v Speaker 2>work out,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2390
00:45:29.161 --> 00:45:29.401
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2391
00:45:29.401 --> 00:45:29.640
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>these Menthol,</v>

2393
00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:30.841
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

2394
00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:32.070
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have to pay attention to that.</v>

2395
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:32.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2396
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:32.851
<v Speaker 2>who knows.</v>

2397
00:45:32.851 --> 00:45:33.260
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2398
00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:36.090
<v Speaker 2>but it opens up the pores actually helps with people cutting way too.</v>

2399
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:37.980
<v Speaker 2>But then she opens up beyond it gets everything out.</v>

2400
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:38.331
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2401
00:45:38.331 --> 00:45:38.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2402
00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I do that once or twice a week.</v>

2403
00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.060
<v Speaker 2>I think the crowd I want,</v>

2404
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.150
<v Speaker 2>I want to start doing that here as soon,</v>

2405
00:45:42.151 --> 00:45:42.331
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>

2406
00:45:42.331 --> 00:45:43.021
<v Speaker 2>twice a week.</v>

2407
00:45:43.021 --> 00:45:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2408
00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:44.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2409
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:45.030
<v Speaker 2>I proteins,</v>

2410
00:45:45.031 --> 00:45:45.751
<v Speaker 2>amino acids,</v>

2411
00:45:45.751 --> 00:45:46.321
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff.</v>

2412
00:45:46.321 --> 00:45:46.471
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2413
00:45:46.471 --> 00:45:47.304
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to,</v>

2414
00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:51.570
<v Speaker 2>I go to a chiropractor a couple times a week and they asked that without sets,</v>

2415
00:45:51.571 --> 00:45:52.450
<v Speaker 2>including massagers.</v>

2416
00:45:52.451 --> 00:45:54.450
<v Speaker 2>So for 20 minute massage after.</v>

2417
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:55.500
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2418
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.360
<v Speaker 2>I think massage is super beneficial.</v>

2419
00:45:57.361 --> 00:45:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I think the more people do that,</v>

2420
00:45:58.830 --> 00:45:59.460
<v Speaker 2>the better.</v>

2421
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I think especially for fighters,</v>

2422
00:46:00.681 --> 00:46:00.961
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

2423
00:46:00.961 --> 00:46:04.020
<v Speaker 2>you're constantly dealing with knots and things that could eventually become</v>

2424
00:46:04.021 --> 00:46:05.070
<v Speaker 2>like real injuries.</v>

2425
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2426
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:09.480
<v Speaker 2>I remember one night I was supposed to have Ben Rothwell and pull out a flight.</v>

2427
00:46:09.481 --> 00:46:10.980
<v Speaker 2>It was like worst time of my life.</v>

2428
00:46:10.981 --> 00:46:11.970
<v Speaker 2>I never pull out a fight before.</v>

2429
00:46:11.971 --> 00:46:12.804
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what to do.</v>

2430
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.160
<v Speaker 2>I feel it couldn't bend over.</v>

2431
00:46:14.161 --> 00:46:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like,</v>

00:47:28.081 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 2>So I go to a</v>

2487
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.220
<v Speaker 1>west and this guy named John Quinn who is a release therapist,</v>

2488
00:47:33.221 --> 00:47:33.490
<v Speaker 1>whoever,</v>

2489
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:34.120
<v Speaker 1>big dude.</v>

2490
00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:34.601
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

2491
00:47:34.601 --> 00:47:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Did he actually say my career?</v>

2492
00:47:35.921 --> 00:47:38.290
<v Speaker 1>He started working on my so ass and started stretching me out.</v>

2493
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Well I mean now I can do head kicks now.</v>

2494
00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I'd never be able to hit kick.</v>

2495
00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:46.150
<v Speaker 1>So it was like a muscle that's just was broken down and it wasn't getting enough</v>

2496
00:47:46.151 --> 00:47:47.770
<v Speaker 1>for covering this wrestling from being,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2499
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:51.310
<v Speaker 1>And then just being tired all the time and then hurting my bag when I was little</v>

2500
00:47:51.311 --> 00:47:51.551
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>

2503
00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:56.643
<v Speaker 1>do yoga.</v>

2504
00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I did the,</v>

2505
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:59.223
<v Speaker 1>it's tough for me</v>

2506
00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:02.150
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2507
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.510

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:04.960
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's supposed to be good for you.</v>

2511
00:48:04.961 --> 00:48:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>

2512
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.890
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do.</v>

2513
00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:07.360
<v Speaker 1>I probably should do it.</v>

2514
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.500
<v Speaker 1>It's just that it's tough.</v>

2515
00:48:08.501 --> 00:48:09.071
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to forget.</v>

2516
00:48:09.071 --> 00:48:11.290
<v Speaker 1>When I was training at a gym before I started doing mixed martial arts,</v>

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.070
<v Speaker 1>She only told me that.</v>

2521
00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:16.481

2526
00:48:21.671 --> 00:48:21.930

2527
00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:22.511
<v Speaker 1>you're just too big.</v>

2528
00:48:22.511 --> 00:48:23.321
<v Speaker 1>Your muscles are too big.</v>

2529
00:48:23.321 --> 00:48:23.450
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2530
00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:24.283
<v Speaker 1>she's told me</v>

2531
00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I was so devastated.</v>

2532
00:48:28.691 --> 00:48:28.821
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2533
00:48:28.821 --> 00:48:29.501

00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:34.030
<v Speaker 1>I lost my Mojo after that.</v>

2540
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:34.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2544
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:42.970

2545
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:48.160
<v Speaker 1>that yoga is a great sort of balancing thing for that keeps you flexible,</v>

00:50:45.351 --> 00:50:47.690
<v Speaker 3>That guy was a magnetic healer and a,</v>

2632
00:50:47.691 --> 00:50:52.130
<v Speaker 3>it came to him in a seance that he could cure all ailments if you manipulate</v>

2633
00:50:52.131 --> 00:50:53.120
<v Speaker 3>people's spines.</v>

2634
00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:53.841
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2635
00:50:53.841 --> 00:50:56.390
<v Speaker 3>And then he was killed by his own son who then,</v>

2636
00:50:56.391 --> 00:50:57.860
<v Speaker 3>who was also a scam artist.</v>

2637
00:50:57.861 --> 00:51:01.310
<v Speaker 3>His own son ran over him with a fucking car and they took over the business.</v>

2638
00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:02.603
<v Speaker 3>I'm so,</v>

2639
00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:04.850
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2640
00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:05.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2641
00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:08.840
<v Speaker 3>people claim all sorts of benefits for all sorts of things,</v>

2642
00:51:08.841 --> 00:51:12.110
<v Speaker 3>but there's no scientific evidence that manipulating your spine does anything.</v>

2643
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.710
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that it does show is that if you can manipulate lower backs,</v>

2644
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.530
<v Speaker 3>sometimes with some people you can relieve some of the pain.</v>

2645
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:21.050
<v Speaker 3>But I think a lot of that is just massaging them.</v>

2646
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:23.270
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of that is just manipulating them,</v>

2647
00:51:23.271 --> 00:51:24.620
<v Speaker 3>just he's just rubbing into them,</v>

2648
00:51:24.621 --> 00:51:26.810
<v Speaker 3>giving them some sort of relief and adjusting them.</v>

2649
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:29.180
<v Speaker 3>But the neck is very dangerous.</v>

2650
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:29.551
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2651
00:51:29.551 --> 00:51:32.830
<v Speaker 3>like people want to get their neck adjusted and feel that pop.</v>

2652
00:51:32.831 --> 00:51:33.471
<v Speaker 3>It feels good.</v>

2653
00:51:33.471 --> 00:51:33.741
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2654
00:51:33.741 --> 00:51:36.710
<v Speaker 3>But literally people have gotten strokes from that.</v>

2655
00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:37.813
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2656
00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:38.921
<v Speaker 3>Well I,</v>

2657
00:51:38.921 --> 00:51:39.754
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2658
00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:40.310
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2659
00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:41.670
<v Speaker 3>I read a study on it and said like,</v>

2660
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:41.931
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2661
00:51:41.931 --> 00:51:42.764
<v Speaker 3>they did like,</v>

2662
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:43.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2663
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.720
<v Speaker 3>adjusting,</v>

2664
00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:43.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2665
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:48.790
<v Speaker 3>twice a week and a kid's like reaction I in sports right quicker just because of</v>

2666
00:51:48.791 --> 00:51:49.624
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2667
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:51.230
<v Speaker 3>everything was like lined up perfectly.</v>

2668
00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:51.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2669
00:51:51.951 --> 00:51:52.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's real.</v>

2670
00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.070
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it is that,</v>

2671
00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you do.</v>

2672
00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:57.693
<v Speaker 3>I'm just sure.</v>

2673
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:59.040
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think that you,</v>

2674
00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:02.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't think your body has been manipulated that way.</v>

2675
00:52:02.751 --> 00:52:05.990
<v Speaker 3>I think that what's happening is you're putting attention on your body.</v>

2676
00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:07.700
<v Speaker 3>You thinking about recovery more,</v>

2677
00:52:07.701 --> 00:52:09.780
<v Speaker 3>you're getting adjusted and while you're getting adjusted,</v>

2678
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.633
<v Speaker 3>getting massage.</v>

2679
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:10.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2680
00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:11.990
<v Speaker 3>like when I used to get adjusted,</v>

2681
00:52:11.991 --> 00:52:13.460
<v Speaker 3>the best part of it was what you said,</v>

2682
00:52:13.461 --> 00:52:14.294
<v Speaker 3>the massage.</v>

2683
00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:15.171
<v Speaker 3>That was the best part.</v>

2684
00:52:15.171 --> 00:52:18.020
<v Speaker 3>I get it massaged and then I get adjusted and it felt good like everything</v>

2685
00:52:18.021 --> 00:52:18.854
<v Speaker 3>loosened up but,</v>

2686
00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:24.280
<v Speaker 3>but when I talked to guys that are actual orthopedic surgeons and real doctors</v>

2687
00:52:24.291 --> 00:52:26.180
<v Speaker 3>like spinal doctors and they talk about it,</v>

2688
00:52:26.181 --> 00:52:29.180
<v Speaker 3>they're like you're just making like a pop.</v>

2689
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:29.901
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not,</v>

2690
00:52:29.901 --> 00:52:31.950
<v Speaker 3>it's not real like it doesn't your,</v>

2691
00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.900
<v Speaker 3>your body be so fucked up if like you could manipulate it one way or another and</v>

2692
00:52:35.901 --> 00:52:36.910
<v Speaker 3>that's how you fix things.</v>

2693
00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:38.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's night fixing things.</v>

2694
00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:39.110
<v Speaker 3>Like you got an injury.</v>

2695
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.120
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a whole bunch of shit going on.</v>

2696
00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:44.000
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have some sort of a muscle pull or a back injury.</v>

2697
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.850
<v Speaker 3>I soured on it when I had a bulging disc.</v>

2698
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:49.400
<v Speaker 3>And the reason why was because this guy was convinced that I didn't have a</v>

2699
00:52:49.401 --> 00:52:52.430
<v Speaker 3>bulging disc and I didn't get an Mri and I was just going to a chiropractor and</v>

2700
00:52:52.431 --> 00:52:53.960
<v Speaker 3>he was like pushing down on my head.</v>

2701
00:52:53.961 --> 00:52:55.630
<v Speaker 3>I had a in my cervical and my,</v>

2702
00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:56.483
<v Speaker 3>my neck,</v>

2703
00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.140
<v Speaker 3>it was uh,</v>

2704
00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:01.760
<v Speaker 3>my hands are going numb from Jujitsu and this guy was like trying to tell him,</v>

2705
00:53:01.761 --> 00:53:02.660
<v Speaker 3>you just keep coming to the car,</v>

2706
00:53:02.661 --> 00:53:03.471
<v Speaker 3>you'll get adjusted,</v>

2707
00:53:03.471 --> 00:53:04.304
<v Speaker 3>it'll be fine.</v>

2708
00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:07.900
<v Speaker 3>And then I finally went to a real doctor and they gave me an Mri and they were</v>

2709
00:53:07.901 --> 00:53:08.031
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2710
00:53:08.031 --> 00:53:08.241
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2711
00:53:08.241 --> 00:53:09.290
<v Speaker 3>this is why you're in pain.</v>

2712
00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:12.650
<v Speaker 3>Your disc is bulging out and it's pressing against your nerve and it's called</v>

2713
00:53:12.651 --> 00:53:14.660
<v Speaker 3>the Ulnar nerve and that's why your hand is going numb.</v>

2714
00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:18.740
<v Speaker 3>Like we're going to give you spinal decompression and you should try to look</v>

2715
00:53:18.741 --> 00:53:21.020
<v Speaker 3>into some things that are going to reduce inflammation.</v>

2716
00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.760
<v Speaker 3>They changed my diet and um,</v>

2717
00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:24.471
<v Speaker 3>I started,</v>

2718
00:53:24.471 --> 00:53:24.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2719
00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 3>getting called Regena cane,</v>

2720
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:29.100
<v Speaker 3>which is like platelet rich plasma where they take your blood,</v>

2721
00:53:29.101 --> 00:53:30.240
<v Speaker 3>they spin it to heat it up.</v>

2722
00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:32.520
<v Speaker 3>And in the heating up the blood,</v>

2723
00:53:32.521 --> 00:53:37.521
<v Speaker 3>it produces this radical anti inflammatory process and they then inject that</v>

2724
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:42.870
<v Speaker 3>your own blood back into the injuries and just fixed it over like a period of</v>

2725
00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:44.310
<v Speaker 3>like two or three months.</v>

2726
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:47.040
<v Speaker 3>Then I got another Mri and it went away.</v>

2727
00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:51.750
<v Speaker 3>So I think a lot of that shit is just fucking Voodoo.</v>

2728
00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:56.460
<v Speaker 3>It's just nonsense and you think it's working or you you you're thinking about</v>

2729
00:53:56.461 --> 00:54:00.420
<v Speaker 3>it or you're giving yourself time to rest while you're getting all those</v>

2730
00:54:00.421 --> 00:54:01.020
<v Speaker 3>adjustments.</v>

2731
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.180
<v Speaker 3>So you think that the adjustments are what's doing it.</v>

2732
00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:06.600
<v Speaker 3>But obviously there's a lot of people that are chiropractors that are very</v>

2733
00:54:06.601 --> 00:54:09.600
<v Speaker 3>skillful in all sorts of different methods of recovery,</v>

2734
00:54:09.601 --> 00:54:10.261
<v Speaker 3>like electrical,</v>

2735
00:54:10.261 --> 00:54:11.430
<v Speaker 3>muscular stimulation,</v>

2736
00:54:11.431 --> 00:54:13.990
<v Speaker 3>massage as a bunch of different things and attraction.</v>

2737
00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:16.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about acupuncture.</v>

2738
00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:18.000
<v Speaker 3>I always,</v>

2739
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.330
<v Speaker 3>I never got it down and I read,</v>

2740
00:54:19.331 --> 00:54:20.164
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2741
00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:21.000
<v Speaker 3>eh.</v>

2742
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.680
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me like Horse Shit.</v>

2743
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:25.330
<v Speaker 3>If I had a guest it just,</v>

2744
00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:26.131
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

2745
00:54:26.131 --> 00:54:28.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe there's some method to it.</v>

2746
00:54:28.051 --> 00:54:31.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think that massage works,</v>

2747
00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:32.970
<v Speaker 3>that definitely works.</v>

2748
00:54:32.971 --> 00:54:33.181
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2749
00:54:33.181 --> 00:54:36.930
<v Speaker 3>if I get a good massage and I have like something that's tight and you know,</v>

2750
00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:40.020
<v Speaker 3>I'll look your neck as fucked up from not tapping or something like that.</v>

2751
00:54:40.021 --> 00:54:41.490
<v Speaker 3>And then you go get it massaged out.</v>

2752
00:54:41.491 --> 00:54:43.020
<v Speaker 3>Like you can fix that.</v>

2753
00:54:43.021 --> 00:54:45.630
<v Speaker 3>Like that actually can provide you some relief.</v>

2754
00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:46.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2755
00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:49.890
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure that if you go to a good one of those people that does the cupping,</v>

2756
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:52.290
<v Speaker 3>like people apparently swear by that Shit,</v>

2757
00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:52.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2758
00:54:52.801 --> 00:54:54.260
<v Speaker 3>you know cup it is covering by the way,</v>

2759
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:55.583
<v Speaker 3>I seen it like,</v>

2760
00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:57.410
<v Speaker 3>like socks on the bag and he's like,</v>

2761
00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.650
<v Speaker 3>it's terrible marks in your body.</v>

2762
00:54:58.651 --> 00:55:00.480
<v Speaker 3>But I think that's half of it.</v>

2763
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.420
<v Speaker 3>Half of it is like the marks and your body make you think like you're getting</v>

2764
00:55:03.421 --> 00:55:07.920
<v Speaker 3>something done but they take this cup and it sucks all your,</v>

2765
00:55:07.921 --> 00:55:09.840
<v Speaker 3>your skin up into the cup.</v>

2766
00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.610
<v Speaker 3>And how does that,</v>

2767
00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:13.013
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how it works.</v>

2768
00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:16.590

<v Speaker 3>I gotta be real careful when you pull up.</v>

2791
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:55.290
<v Speaker 3>How does cupping work?</v>

2792
00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:56.933
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2795
00:55:58.501 --> 00:55:59.311
<v Speaker 3>How does it work?</v>

2796
00:55:59.311 --> 00:56:04.110
<v Speaker 3>The Glass Cup is warmed by burning and alcohol soaked cotton ball inside of it</v>

2797
00:56:04.111 --> 00:56:04.944
<v Speaker 3>and they're making a bomb.</v>

2798
00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:06.000
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2799
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:06.570
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2800
00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:09.000
<v Speaker 3>this removes the oxygen in the cup,</v>

2801
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:10.650
<v Speaker 3>which creates a vacuum.</v>

2802
00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:14.220
<v Speaker 3>The Cup is turned upside down and placed on the patient's back.</v>

2803
00:56:14.221 --> 00:56:16.680
<v Speaker 3>The vacuum created by the lack of oxygen.</v>

2804
00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:16.931
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2805
00:56:16.931 --> 00:56:18.210
<v Speaker 3>that's this kind of cupping.</v>

2806
00:56:18.211 --> 00:56:20.880
<v Speaker 3>But the other one seemed to have like a stem on the top of it.</v>

2807
00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.320
<v Speaker 3>We're a vacuum thing pulls in,</v>

2808
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:24.580
<v Speaker 3>but what is it supposed to do?</v>

2815
00:56:35.711 --> 00:56:36.550
<v Speaker 3>skin's pores,</v>

2816
00:56:36.551 --> 00:56:40.120
<v Speaker 3>which helps to stimulate the blood flow balances and realigns the flow.</v>

2817
00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:40.481
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You fucking dipshit.</v>

2824
00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:55.420
<v Speaker 3>Breaking up obstructions creates an avenue for toxins to be drawn out of the</v>

2825
00:56:55.421 --> 00:56:56.254
<v Speaker 3>body again,</v>

2845

<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

2846
00:57:19.421 --> 00:57:20.041
<v Speaker 3>it's a sauna.</v>

2847
00:57:20.041 --> 00:57:22.300
<v Speaker 3>After I've been drinking all day sweat.</v>

<v Speaker 3>a little fat filter out some of that water,</v>

2851
00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:30.280
<v Speaker 5>that ionic foot spa thing.</v>

2852
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.801
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2853
00:57:30.801 --> 00:57:32.810
<v Speaker 3>that's the worst where the the your foot,</v>

2854
00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:36.140
<v Speaker 3>the water turns black and they try to pretend that it's like toxins coming out</v>

2855
00:57:36.141 --> 00:57:36.650
<v Speaker 3>of you.</v>

2856
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:38.180
<v Speaker 3>But meanwhile it's just a reaction.</v>

2857
00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:39.830
<v Speaker 3>It's a chemical reaction.</v>

2858
00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2859

00:57:42.511 --> 00:57:42.870
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2863
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:44.090
<v Speaker 3>they have this thing,</v>

2865
00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:50.180
<v Speaker 3>your foot sits in it and there's some sort of reaction with the water and your</v>

2866
00:57:50.181 --> 00:57:50.490
<v Speaker 3>feet.</v>

2867
00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:52.040
<v Speaker 3>It turns black and they try to tell you,</v>

2868
00:57:52.041 --> 00:57:52.341
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2869
00:57:52.341 --> 00:57:55.550
<v Speaker 3>the toxins and coming out of your body and then you walk out of there.</v>

2870
00:57:55.551 --> 00:57:56.570
<v Speaker 3>I feel amazing.</v>

2871
00:57:56.571 --> 00:57:56.751
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2872
00:57:56.751 --> 00:57:57.650
<v Speaker 3>I need a colonic.</v>

00:57:58.070 --> 00:57:58.903
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2874
00:57:58.970 --> 00:57:59.803
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2875
00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:00.801
<v Speaker 3>This is not real.</v>

2876
00:58:00.801 --> 00:58:01.640
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

2877
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:03.050
<v Speaker 3>What is that like?</v>

2878
00:58:03.051 --> 00:58:03.890
<v Speaker 3>What are they doing?</v>

2879
00:58:03.891 --> 00:58:05.220
<v Speaker 3>What is the exact reaction?</v>

2880
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:08.360
<v Speaker 5>There's lots of videos you can look up where people would do the exact process</v>

2881
00:58:08.361 --> 00:58:10.340
<v Speaker 5>with at night without putting anything in there.</v>

2882
00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:10.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2883
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:11.660
<v Speaker 5>And the water is still turns black.</v>

2884
00:58:11.661 --> 00:58:14.030
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's something to do with like battery acid or,</v>

2885
00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:14.810
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2886
00:58:14.810 --> 00:58:15.141
<v Speaker 5>Honestly,</v>

2887
00:58:15.141 --> 00:58:15.741
<v Speaker 5>that might not be it,</v>

2888
00:58:15.741 --> 00:58:16.521
<v Speaker 5>but it's something weird.</v>

2889
00:58:16.521 --> 00:58:17.354
<v Speaker 5>It's bullshit.</v>

2913
00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:51.530
<v Speaker 3>what are you trying to exercise from this lady's body?</v>

2914
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:53.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:54.710
<v Speaker 3>And next thing you know,</v>

2916
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:56.540
<v Speaker 3>she's the number one porno star in America.</v>

2917
00:58:56.541 --> 00:58:57.920
<v Speaker 3>I look and I did it with my hands,</v>

2918
00:58:57.921 --> 00:58:58.670
<v Speaker 3>my healing,</v>

2919
00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:59.331
<v Speaker 3>my Reiki,</v>

2920
00:58:59.331 --> 00:59:00.164
<v Speaker 3>healing.</v>

2921
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:01.160
<v Speaker 3>I met a dude last night.</v>

2922
00:59:01.161 --> 00:59:03.620
<v Speaker 3>There was a psychic healer told me it was a psychic healer.</v>

2923
00:59:03.830 --> 00:59:04.101
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2924
00:59:04.101 --> 00:59:04.940
<v Speaker 3>good luck with that.</v>

2925
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:06.410
<v Speaker 3>That's not real.</v>

2926
00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:09.590
<v Speaker 3>You fuck psychic healer.</v>

2927
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:13.250
<v Speaker 3>The reason I asked about icing cause like I know there's some people that don't</v>

2928
00:59:13.251 --> 00:59:13.620
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

2929
00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:14.550
<v Speaker 3>they like doing that.</v>

2930
00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:17.930
<v Speaker 3>Like the drink gets hurt unless it's needed,</v>

2931
00:59:17.931 --> 00:59:18.310
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

2932
00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:18.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2933
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:21.050
<v Speaker 3>see you sprain your ankle and you can't just start moving right away and get</v>

2934
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:22.250
<v Speaker 3>blood flow back in there without,</v>

2935
00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:23.513
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2936
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.931
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2937
00:59:23.931 --> 00:59:25.910
<v Speaker 3>there's some evidence that,</v>

2938
00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:26.773
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2939
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:30.590
<v Speaker 3>well I think it depends entirely upon the injury,</v>

2940
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:35.770
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at the vast majority of scientists and sports medicine</v>

2941
00:59:36.261 --> 00:59:38.750
<v Speaker 3>therapists and the people that are at the cutting edge of the business,</v>

2942
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:40.100
<v Speaker 3>they almost all use eyes.</v>

2943
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:40.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2944
00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:41.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2945
00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:42.350
<v Speaker 3>They don't think that you,</v>

2946
00:59:42.351 --> 00:59:43.820
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to use ice,</v>

2947
00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2948
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:45.710
<v Speaker 3>within,</v>

2949
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:46.221
<v Speaker 3>what was it?</v>

2950
00:59:46.221 --> 00:59:47.600
<v Speaker 3>Who was it on the podcast?</v>

2951
00:59:47.601 --> 00:59:49.220
<v Speaker 3>Was it a Andy Galpin?</v>

2952
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:51.320
<v Speaker 3>Who was it that was talking about the,</v>

2953
00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:56.210
<v Speaker 3>about the timeframe between icing and exercise where you need to,</v>

2954
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:57.890
<v Speaker 3>or it might've been Rhonda Patrick.</v>

2955
00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:02.120
<v Speaker 3>There's a beneficial amount of time you should wait before you ice after an</v>

2956
01:00:02.121 --> 01:00:03.680
<v Speaker 3>exercise like that.</v>

2957
01:00:03.681 --> 01:00:03.911
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2958
01:00:03.911 --> 01:00:08.690
<v Speaker 3>you give yourself a chance for more recovery and more growth.</v>

2959
01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.970
<v Speaker 3>If you wait a while before icing,</v>

2960
01:00:10.971 --> 01:00:11.300
<v Speaker 3>like save,</v>

2961
01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:12.530
<v Speaker 3>you had a hard training session,</v>

2962
01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:15.170
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't want to go right to cryotherapy.</v>

2963
01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.940
<v Speaker 3>You might want to wait an hour and a half,</v>

2964
01:00:16.941 --> 01:00:20.690
<v Speaker 3>two hours and then go and then you'll get the benefits of the hard training.</v>

2965
01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.810
<v Speaker 3>But then you also get the anti-inflammatory benefits of Cryo.</v>

2966
01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2967
01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.590
<v Speaker 2>when I get crown at first time,</v>

2968
01:00:25.591 --> 01:00:27.190
<v Speaker 2>a couple of times to do it and I was like this</v>

2969
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:29.310
<v Speaker 2>sucks.</v>

2970
01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Like I wasted a bunch of money.</v>

2971
01:00:30.601 --> 01:00:31.321
<v Speaker 2>Like this is like,</v>

2972
01:00:31.321 --> 01:00:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I just hated it.</v>

2973
01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:33.293
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2974
01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:34.081
<v Speaker 2>This is the only place.</v>

2975
01:00:34.081 --> 01:00:34.891
<v Speaker 2>Plus also it's free,</v>

2976
01:00:34.891 --> 01:00:35.724
<v Speaker 2>which is nice.</v>

2977
01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:37.560
<v Speaker 2>That's really nice.</v>

2978
01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:37.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2979
01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:37.981
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2980
01:00:37.981 --> 01:00:38.491
<v Speaker 2>And the guy's like,</v>

2981
01:00:38.491 --> 01:00:38.881
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2982

2985
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:45.840
<v Speaker 2>It was like I felt the coldness coming like in my whole body.</v>

2986

<v Speaker 2>And so it was a better place you into a better place?</v>

2987
01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.061
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

2988
01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:49.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it works cause I definitely feel a difference.</v>

2989
01:00:49.801 --> 01:00:51.150
<v Speaker 2>You know how long you in town for?</v>

2991
01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:52.710
<v Speaker 2>Tim,</v>

2992
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:53.970
<v Speaker 2>I want to take you to a place out here,</v>

2993
01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:55.710
<v Speaker 3>cryotherapy,</v>

2994
01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:56.960
<v Speaker 3>cryo healthcare out here.</v>

2995
01:00:56.961 --> 01:00:58.430
<v Speaker 3>They have a very unique system.</v>

2996
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:59.600
<v Speaker 3>Their system is,</v>

2997
01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.720
<v Speaker 3>it's first of all the guys that developed it,</v>

2998
01:01:02.721 --> 01:01:06.290
<v Speaker 3>what they did was instead of having it while you're breathing in lik liquid</v>

2999
01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:07.124
<v Speaker 3>nitrogen,</v>

3000
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.210
<v Speaker 3>you know like where it's from,</v>

3001
01:01:08.211 --> 01:01:08.961
<v Speaker 3>the neck down,</v>

3002
01:01:08.961 --> 01:01:10.130
<v Speaker 3>which is a lot of those places.</v>

3003
01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:13.610
<v Speaker 3>You go into it and you're breathing air and you have to have your head above</v>

3004
01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:17.540
<v Speaker 3>where the Cryo is because you can't breed that shit in which is how that girl in</v>

3005
01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:18.291
<v Speaker 3>Vegas died.</v>

3006
01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:18.920
<v Speaker 3>Folks,</v>

3007
01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.030
<v Speaker 3>if you don't know,</v>

3008
01:01:20.031 --> 01:01:20.870
<v Speaker 3>there's a girl in Vegas,</v>

3009
01:01:20.871 --> 01:01:25.871
<v Speaker 3>they went in the tank by herself and she was too short and she was breathing in</v>

3010
01:01:25.881 --> 01:01:29.150
<v Speaker 3>the nitrogen and she passed out and then she froze to death.</v>

3011
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:31.350
<v Speaker 3>But the ones that cryo healthcare,</v>

3012
01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:32.300
<v Speaker 3>that's the normal one.</v>

3013
01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.100
<v Speaker 3>That's like Floyd Mayweather in there,</v>

3014
01:01:34.101 --> 01:01:35.630
<v Speaker 3>right there where you see the,</v>

3015
01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:36.170
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3016
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:36.560
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3017
01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.020
<v Speaker 3>the cryo stuff is all below his head.</v>

3018
01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:41.510
<v Speaker 3>The ones that Cryo healthcare,</v>

3019
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:45.830
<v Speaker 3>they jack the temperature way down like 240 degrees below zero.</v>

3020
01:01:45.831 --> 01:01:48.620
<v Speaker 3>And one of what they do is they freeze the air itself.</v>

3021
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:51.770
<v Speaker 3>So the air they're pumping into his super cold air.</v>

3022
01:01:51.771 --> 01:01:54.980
<v Speaker 3>So you go in there with full,</v>

3023
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:56.050
<v Speaker 3>like you're,</v>

3024
01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:56.581
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3025
01:01:56.581 --> 01:01:58.310
<v Speaker 3>you're breathing in this cold air.</v>

3026
01:01:58.311 --> 01:01:59.210
<v Speaker 3>It's on your head.</v>

3027
01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.270
<v Speaker 3>Your full body is immersed in this,</v>

3028
01:02:01.271 --> 01:02:02.104
<v Speaker 3>this cold air.</v>

3029
01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.290
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>

3030
01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:06.890
<v Speaker 3>it's way more intense and it's supposed to have way more benefit because your</v>

3031
01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:08.120
<v Speaker 3>head gets cold too.</v>

3032
01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.200
<v Speaker 3>So the reaction that your body has for producing sidechains and</v>

3033
01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.420
<v Speaker 3>anti-inflammatory,</v>

3034
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:14.630
<v Speaker 3>cold shock proteins,</v>

3035
01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:18.140
<v Speaker 3>your body freaks out way more when everything is covered.</v>

3036
01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:19.770
<v Speaker 3>Not just the neck down,</v>

3037
01:02:19.771 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 3>but your</v>

3038
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.843
<v Speaker 2>head too.</v>

3039
01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3040
01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:21.630
<v Speaker 2>So too,</v>

3041
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:22.261
<v Speaker 2>I wish you were in town.</v>

3042
01:02:22.261 --> 01:02:22.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll take you there.</v>

3043
01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:23.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3044
01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:23.761
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty sweet.</v>

3045
01:02:23.761 --> 01:02:24.451
<v Speaker 2>We gotta do this.</v>

3046
01:02:24.451 --> 01:02:25.920

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:30.150
<v Speaker 2>What do you have to do other UFC stuff now?</v>

3050
01:02:30.151 --> 01:02:30.651
<v Speaker 2>Not even your,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3056
01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:32.970
<v Speaker 2>my stuff,</v>

3057
01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:33.803
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3058
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.381
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to go,</v>

3059
01:02:34.381 --> 01:02:36.900
<v Speaker 2>but I had to go like a big kid.</v>

3060
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:37.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3061
01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:39.480
<v Speaker 2>it's my wife's like just go and I,</v>

3062
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:40.370
<v Speaker 2>I put below,</v>

3063
01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:41.203
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

3064
01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:43.380
<v Speaker 2>That's funny right now.</v>

3065
01:02:43.381 --> 01:02:45.960
<v Speaker 2>And just training when you have a big fight,</v>

3066
01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.220
<v Speaker 2>how much of the big fight is like how much of the pain in the ass it's doing</v>

3067
01:02:50.221 --> 01:02:51.054
<v Speaker 2>press?</v>

3068
01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:55.260
<v Speaker 2>I want to say you're complaining about it,</v>

3069
01:02:55.261 --> 01:02:57.390
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's as far as like time constraints.</v>

3070
01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:58.620
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it sucks.</v>

3071
01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:01.180
<v Speaker 2>It does suck cause like you and you're sitting in a year,</v>

3072
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.820
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about doing this in the car.</v>

3073
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:03.541
<v Speaker 2>Like hey,</v>

3074
01:03:03.541 --> 01:03:03.850
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3075
01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:05.100
<v Speaker 2>oh right.</v>

3076
01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:05.641
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3077
01:03:05.641 --> 01:03:07.370
<v Speaker 2>but I understand it's part of the game.</v>

3078
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.410
<v Speaker 2>It helps you know,</v>

3079
01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:09.940
<v Speaker 2>promote you and you know,</v>

3080
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.950
<v Speaker 2>your sales and you know,</v>

3081
01:03:10.951 --> 01:03:11.491
<v Speaker 2>paper views,</v>

3082
01:03:11.491 --> 01:03:12.420
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff like this.</v>

3083
01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.550
<v Speaker 2>But there's like a balance to be achieved.</v>

3084
01:03:14.551 --> 01:03:14.701
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3085
01:03:14.701 --> 01:03:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Those kind of Greg argument,</v>

3086
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Conor Mcgregor's argument was whether when he went on that world tour with Aldo,</v>

3087
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:21.030
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

3088
01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.740
<v Speaker 2>they just did way too much.</v>

3089
01:03:22.741 --> 01:03:23.430
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3090
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:25.200
<v Speaker 2>by the time you're doing all this,</v>

3091
01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:26.400
<v Speaker 2>you don't have time to train.</v>

3092
01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:26.851
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

3093
01:03:26.851 --> 01:03:28.110
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you're going to train,</v>

3094
01:03:28.111 --> 01:03:28.561
<v Speaker 2>recover,</v>

3095
01:03:28.561 --> 01:03:29.430
<v Speaker 2>sleep correctly.</v>

3096
01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:32.280
<v Speaker 2>You're flying from one city to another country,</v>

3097
01:03:32.281 --> 01:03:35.340
<v Speaker 2>to another country and you're just constantly on a jet.</v>

3098
01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:36.600
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3099
01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3100
01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:38.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3101
01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:39.150
<v Speaker 2>when we went to Australia,</v>

3102
01:03:39.151 --> 01:03:39.841
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm flew,</v>

3103
01:03:39.841 --> 01:03:41.960
<v Speaker 2>I'll share my five Mark Hunt and uh,</v>

3104
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:45.600
<v Speaker 2>I remember I flew more than it actually was there in Australia while I was there</v>

3105
01:03:45.601 --> 01:03:47.340
<v Speaker 2>for like a day and a half and I flew back home.</v>

3106
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.353
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

3107
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.201
<v Speaker 2>It was bad.</v>

3108
01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:50.730
<v Speaker 2>So the flight is more,</v>

3109
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:51.720
<v Speaker 2>more time.</v>

3110
01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:52.291
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

3111
01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:54.440
<v Speaker 2>it was like a 20 hour flight there in 24 and 20 hours</v>

3112
01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:57.953
<v Speaker 2>of Dicks.</v>

3113
01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.093
<v Speaker 2>That flight is,</v>

3114
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.230
<v Speaker 2>you get out of there and you're just half a person,</v>

3115
01:04:01.231 --> 01:04:06.231
<v Speaker 2>you look confused and like something happens to you when you fly in 1617 hours</v>

3116
01:04:06.991 --> 01:04:07.440
<v Speaker 2>in a plane.</v>

3117
01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I was there for after the flat.</v>

3118
01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.530
<v Speaker 2>So I got there a week early before the flight.</v>

3119
01:04:10.531 --> 01:04:12.990
<v Speaker 2>I stayed for the week of the flight and I was there like three or four more days</v>

3120
01:04:12.991 --> 01:04:13.261
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

3121
01:04:13.261 --> 01:04:14.430
<v Speaker 2>So I was the one who was there with three,</v>

3122
01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:15.990
<v Speaker 2>three and a half,</v>

3123
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.590
<v Speaker 2>two and a half,</v>

3124
01:04:16.590 --> 01:04:17.423
<v Speaker 2>23 weeks.</v>

3125
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:19.410
<v Speaker 2>And I got home and I literally,</v>

3126
01:04:19.411 --> 01:04:20.041
<v Speaker 2>it was crazy.</v>

3127
01:04:20.041 --> 01:04:23.430
<v Speaker 2>So I get home at like seven in the morning and my brothers in my house,</v>

3128
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:24.990
<v Speaker 2>my wife from your wife come home and I'm like,</v>

3129
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:29.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm tracking my eyes open and like it was like my,</v>

3130
01:04:29.071 --> 01:04:31.200
<v Speaker 2>I was like so miss combobulated so I'd get in the car.</v>

3131
01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:34.830
<v Speaker 2>I almost forgot how to drive because I was on the other side of it was my</v>

3132
01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:35.071
<v Speaker 2>brother.</v>

3133
01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:35.281
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3134
01:04:35.281 --> 01:04:36.001
<v Speaker 2>you should probably drive.</v>

3135
01:04:36.001 --> 01:04:38.100
<v Speaker 2>He's the way I like cause I have not been on the side of the road in a long</v>

3136
01:04:38.101 --> 01:04:38.550
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3137
01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:39.720

3138
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.931

<v Speaker 3>You see that video?</v>

3201
01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:06.380

<v Speaker 3>They have this 39 foot boat and they have an overhead,</v>

3204
01:06:10.291 --> 01:06:13.140
<v Speaker 3>like a drone footage of the sharks swimming around the boat.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And you'll get like this sort of connection with your food.</v>

<v Speaker 3>what was this one?</v>

3302
01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:12.290
<v Speaker 3>She's in south beach the other day.</v>

3303
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:14.210
<v Speaker 3>Some guy just shortly,</v>

3304
01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:15.740
<v Speaker 3>10 feet the coast.</v>

3305

<v Speaker 3>This guys just trying to die.</v>

3306
01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.010
<v Speaker 3>What is he doing?</v>

3307
01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:20.540
<v Speaker 3>Because I don't know if he even saw it.</v>

3308
01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:21.470
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

3309
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3310
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:26.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm on this boat and we catch a Marlin within</v>

3311
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:29.890
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes of the,</v>

3312
01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:30.770
<v Speaker 3>the trip,</v>

3313
01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:31.603
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes in,</v>

3314
01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.510
<v Speaker 3>we catch a Marlin,</v>

3315
01:08:32.511 --> 01:08:33.231
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy,</v>

3316
01:08:33.231 --> 01:08:33.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3317
01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:34.603
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden</v>

3318
01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm pulling this thing in and it's not a big Marlin.</v>

3319
01:08:38.241 --> 01:08:40.730
<v Speaker 3>It's probably like 80 pounds or something like that.</v>

3320
01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:45.710
<v Speaker 3>We get it into the boat and they beat the fucking thing to death with clubs</v>

3321
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:46.581
<v Speaker 3>right in front of her.</v>

3322
01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:47.480
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's what they do.</v>

3323
01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.910
<v Speaker 3>They pull it in and then just fucking thump,</v>

3324
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:50.990
<v Speaker 3>thump,</v>

3325
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.441
<v Speaker 3>thump.</v>

3326
01:08:51.441 --> 01:08:52.274
<v Speaker 3>And she's sitting there,</v>

3327
01:08:52.450 --> 01:08:53.283
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>

3328
01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:56.660
<v Speaker 3>And then they put it on ice after that.</v>

3329
01:08:56.690 --> 01:08:57.770
<v Speaker 3>And then when they put it on ice,</v>

3330
01:08:57.771 --> 01:08:58.880
<v Speaker 3>it's like still alive.</v>

3331
01:08:58.910 --> 01:09:02.480
<v Speaker 3>Every now and then he'd hear like its tail.</v>

3332
01:09:02.481 --> 01:09:03.560
<v Speaker 3>It'd be flapping out,</v>

3333
01:09:03.561 --> 01:09:04.430
<v Speaker 3>it'd be spasming.</v>

3334
01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:07.100
<v Speaker 3>It would come back to life and they sub it in the head again.</v>

3335
01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:11.180
<v Speaker 3>She was a vegetarian for another year after that took a while.</v>

3336
01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.860
<v Speaker 3>It took a while to turn it back around.</v>

3337
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:15.560
<v Speaker 3>My thought was like,</v>

3338
01:09:15.710 --> 01:09:17.440
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go catch some Mahi Mahi.</v>

3339
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:19.550
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be great Marlin,</v>

3340
01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:20.900
<v Speaker 3>you usually don't catch a Marlin.</v>

3341
01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:22.790
<v Speaker 3>And we caught one within 10 minutes.</v>

3342
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:23.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3343
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:23.931
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

3344
01:09:23.931 --> 01:09:24.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3345
01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:25.183
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3346
01:09:25.450 --> 01:09:25.640
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3347
01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.880
<v Speaker 3>like you were going to be a good dad.</v>

3348
01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:27.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3349
01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:28.930
<v Speaker 3>like they're just</v>

3350
01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:31.440
<v Speaker 3>smash the smile.</v>

3351
01:09:32.610 --> 01:09:34.790
<v Speaker 3>It's just was the total wrong experience.</v>

3352
01:09:34.791 --> 01:09:35.930
<v Speaker 3>Like my youngest daughter's,</v>

3353
01:09:35.931 --> 01:09:40.730
<v Speaker 3>I took them fishing and they caught little fish and it was a great experience.</v>

3354
01:09:40.731 --> 01:09:41.990
<v Speaker 3>It was like what I was hoping for,</v>

3355
01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:43.460
<v Speaker 3>like the caught little fish.</v>

3356
01:09:43.461 --> 01:09:45.080
<v Speaker 3>We brought it back to the restaurant.</v>

3357
01:09:45.081 --> 01:09:46.220
<v Speaker 3>The restaurant cooked him.</v>

3358
01:09:46.221 --> 01:09:48.320
<v Speaker 3>You were staying at a resort and that was great.</v>

3359
01:09:48.321 --> 01:09:48.581
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3360
01:09:48.581 --> 01:09:49.414
<v Speaker 3>Woo,</v>

3361
01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:50.323
<v Speaker 3>nobody got club.</v>

3362
01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.450
<v Speaker 3>I was terrified the first time I took them.</v>

3363
01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:53.961
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3364
01:09:53.961 --> 01:09:57.410
<v Speaker 3>if you're fucking four and you watch a Marlin and get clubbed today,</v>

3365
01:09:57.570 --> 01:09:59.270
<v Speaker 3>might not ever bounce back from that.</v>

3366
01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.100
<v Speaker 3>I remember I would do if I,</v>

3367
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:03.263
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>

3368
01:10:03.450 --> 01:10:05.750
<v Speaker 3>if I was a child and saw that I probably be scarred for life.</v>

3369
01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:09.080
<v Speaker 3>I fucked up.</v>

3370
01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:09.411
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

3371
01:10:09.411 --> 01:10:09.860
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't.</v>

3372
01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:10.131
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3373
01:10:10.131 --> 01:10:11.890
<v Speaker 3>the only time I've ever caught a Marlin to I've,</v>

3374
01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:14.420
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten ocean fish and a hundred times they won't cut a Marlin.</v>

3375
01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:15.980
<v Speaker 3>I've never been Osha fishing.</v>

3376
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:16.431
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3377
01:10:16.431 --> 01:10:17.264
<v Speaker 3>it's the best.</v>

3378
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3379
01:10:17.751 --> 01:10:17.961
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3380
01:10:17.961 --> 01:10:18.680
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

3381
01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:18.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3382
01:10:18.861 --> 01:10:21.920
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that that's kind of a bummer was a lot of times they just want a</v>

3383
01:10:21.921 --> 01:10:22.550
<v Speaker 3>troll.</v>

3384
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.821
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3385
01:10:22.821 --> 01:10:24.780
<v Speaker 3>So they're just pulling the lines behind the boats.</v>

3386
01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:26.360
<v Speaker 3>You're not really actively doing anything.</v>

3387
01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:27.740
<v Speaker 3>I like casting,</v>

3388
01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:28.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3389
01:10:28.501 --> 01:10:32.090
<v Speaker 3>like the best a ocean fishing I've done is in Mexico for,</v>

3390
01:10:32.091 --> 01:10:32.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3391
01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:35.270
<v Speaker 3>I think there are either skipjack or amberjack tune and I forget what they're</v>

3392
01:10:35.271 --> 01:10:35.571
<v Speaker 3>called,</v>

3393
01:10:35.571 --> 01:10:37.550
<v Speaker 3>but we would go and there would be a,</v>

3394
01:10:37.551 --> 01:10:40.220
<v Speaker 3>they would follow these seagulls and bait fish.</v>

3395
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:43.100
<v Speaker 3>So like the bait fish should be frothing on the water cause the tuna were</v>

3396
01:10:43.101 --> 01:10:45.740
<v Speaker 3>underneath jacket him and then just cast into them and just,</v>

3397
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:45.921
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3398
01:10:45.921 --> 01:10:46.510
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing.</v>

3399
01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:47.450
<v Speaker 3>We're in Mexico.</v>

3400
01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:48.111
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3401
01:10:48.111 --> 01:10:51.260
<v Speaker 3>it was outside of Cabo,</v>

3402
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:52.580
<v Speaker 3>so it's like,</v>

3403
01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:53.414
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3404
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:55.191
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3405
01:10:55.191 --> 01:10:55.401
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3406
01:10:55.401 --> 01:10:56.440
<v Speaker 3>it was outside Puerto by.</v>

3407
01:10:57.230 --> 01:10:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3408
01:10:57.850 --> 01:11:01.250
<v Speaker 3>it was outside Puerto Bayada so I'm not sure like what part of the ocean it was,</v>

3409
01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:02.780
<v Speaker 3>but it's great.</v>

3410
01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:03.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3411
01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.020
<v Speaker 3>it's not when you eat a fish that you caught like an hour ago,</v>

3412
01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:07.011
<v Speaker 3>you realize like,</v>

3413
01:11:07.011 --> 01:11:07.431
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3414
01:11:07.431 --> 01:11:08.540
<v Speaker 3>this tastes way better.</v>

3415
01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3416
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:09.591
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

3417
01:11:09.591 --> 01:11:10.460
<v Speaker 3>Like what happened?</v>

3418
01:11:10.461 --> 01:11:11.780
<v Speaker 3>The degrading of the,</v>

3419
01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.910
<v Speaker 3>it's the kind of the opposite meat because with meat,</v>

3420
01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:18.750
<v Speaker 3>like you can eat a lot of meat fresh right after he kill it and it tastes really</v>

3421
01:11:18.751 --> 01:11:19.081
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>

3422
01:11:19.081 --> 01:11:20.040
<v Speaker 3>but much,</v>

3423
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.260
<v Speaker 3>much of like,</v>

3424
01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:25.300
<v Speaker 3>like the best cuts of meat that you get like from a butcher or form a,</v>

3425
01:11:25.301 --> 01:11:25.621
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3426
01:11:25.621 --> 01:11:26.850
<v Speaker 3>a really good steak restaurant.</v>

3427
01:11:26.851 --> 01:11:28.910
<v Speaker 3>They let it age now they let an,</v>

3428
01:11:28.911 --> 01:11:30.420
<v Speaker 3>apparently they do that with tuna too.</v>

3429
01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.890
<v Speaker 3>Like when you get Sushi.</v>

3430
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:32.783
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>

3431
01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3432
01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.290
<v Speaker 3>they let that Shit Age.</v>

3433
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:35.443
<v Speaker 2>I love Sushi.</v>

3434
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:36.343
<v Speaker 2>Do you fish?</v>

3435
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

3436
01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean I used to like back in the day.</v>

3437
01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3438
01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:40.970
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3439
01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:41.803
<v Speaker 2>how do you have time,</v>

3440
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:42.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3441
01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:42.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3442
01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:42.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of busy.</v>

3443
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:43.880
<v Speaker 2>I have a little pot in my house,</v>

3444
01:11:43.881 --> 01:11:45.050
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think have a pond.</v>

3445
01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:45.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3446
01:11:45.441 --> 01:11:47.060
<v Speaker 2>it's not huge.</v>

3447
01:11:47.061 --> 01:11:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Probably 20 yards by 20 yards.</v>

3448
01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:49.604
<v Speaker 2>Not Big at all.</v>

3449
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:52.130
<v Speaker 2>But we do have the massive turtles,</v>

3450
01:11:52.131 --> 01:11:52.620
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3451
01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:53.610
<v Speaker 2>like the one that bond.</v>

3452
01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:54.741
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>

3453
01:11:54.741 --> 01:11:56.540
<v Speaker 2>So I actually,</v>

3454
01:11:56.541 --> 01:11:57.260
<v Speaker 2>we made a bet,</v>

3455
01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:58.480
<v Speaker 2>one of the UFC fights and budget.</v>

3456
01:11:58.490 --> 01:12:02.190
<v Speaker 2>My coaches were over and I was lit up having fun in the work and I never bet.</v>

3457
01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:02.720
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

3458
01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:02.910
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>

3459
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:03.160
<v Speaker 2>bridging.</v>

3460
01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:03.751
<v Speaker 2>This person went.</v>

3461
01:12:03.751 --> 01:12:04.161
<v Speaker 2>And so I was like,</v>

3462
01:12:04.161 --> 01:12:04.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll take that back.</v>

3463
01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Like w w w what happens in you when I'm like,</v>

3464
01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:08.270
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

3465
01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:09.200
<v Speaker 2>if the person that wins,</v>

3466
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:10.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3467
01:12:10.191 --> 01:12:10.551
<v Speaker 2>you can do,</v>

3468
01:12:10.551 --> 01:12:11.900
<v Speaker 2>everyone can pick whatever,</v>

3469
01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:12.580
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3470
01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:13.190
<v Speaker 2>So I went,</v>

3471
01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:13.551
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

3472
01:12:13.551 --> 01:12:16.120
<v Speaker 2>you gotta have to get in them getting a little shuttle boat and had to go across</v>

3473
01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:17.960
<v Speaker 2>the lake and we did snow balls at you.</v>

3474
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:18.980
<v Speaker 2>It was when I never winter.</v>

3475
01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:20.413
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

3476
01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:20.901
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3477
01:12:20.901 --> 01:12:22.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm like 100% you're going to do it.</v>

3478
01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:23.990
<v Speaker 2>So the best part was,</v>

3479
01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:24.531
<v Speaker 2>it was heavy.</v>

3480
01:12:24.531 --> 01:12:25.460
<v Speaker 2>It was covered in ice.</v>

3481
01:12:25.461 --> 01:12:26.810
<v Speaker 2>So they can go anywhere and put pedicle.</v>

3482
01:12:26.811 --> 01:12:27.644
<v Speaker 2>It's sucks.</v>

3483
01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.750
<v Speaker 2>So they're just sitting and I'm just really numb,</v>

3484
01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:31.071
<v Speaker 2>so whatever.</v>

3485
01:12:31.071 --> 01:12:33.080
<v Speaker 2>And we'll do our thing in Austin,</v>

3486
01:12:33.081 --> 01:12:33.801
<v Speaker 2>like months later,</v>

3487
01:12:33.801 --> 01:12:34.311
<v Speaker 2>my wife's like,</v>

3488
01:12:34.311 --> 01:12:34.840
<v Speaker 2>honey,</v>

3489
01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.170
<v Speaker 2>she sends me a video of these,</v>

3490
01:12:36.230 --> 01:12:37.940
<v Speaker 2>these massive snapping turtles.</v>

3491
01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:39.800
<v Speaker 2>They're like hate fucking each other.</v>

3492
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:41.560
<v Speaker 2>Like really the ones I sent,</v>

3493
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:41.880
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

3494
01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:42.820
<v Speaker 2>if I can find it on the phone,</v>

3495
01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:44.500
<v Speaker 2>the ones like this and I'll get some bags.</v>

3496
01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:45.671
<v Speaker 2>And I was thinking,</v>

3497
01:12:45.671 --> 01:12:46.504
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3498
01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.050
<v Speaker 2>I tried to like brace face off.</v>

3499
01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:48.261
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3500
01:12:48.261 --> 01:12:48.951
<v Speaker 2>what the Hell is going on?</v>

3501
01:12:48.951 --> 01:12:49.730
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

3502
01:12:49.730 --> 01:12:52.970
<v Speaker 2>but they were like know they had bought that doing that big there are massive.</v>

3503
01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:56.300
<v Speaker 2>And then I looked over and they had like a bunch of babies and they don't and</v>

3504
01:12:56.301 --> 01:12:59.450
<v Speaker 2>then an extra so long I get the grab and by like by the behind the,</v>

3505
01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:00.890
<v Speaker 2>cause they'll bite your hand off.</v>

3506
01:13:01.150 --> 01:13:01.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3507
01:13:01.381 --> 01:13:02.120
<v Speaker 2>So those uh,</v>

3508
01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.380
<v Speaker 2>just moved into your neighborhood?</v>

3509
01:13:03.381 --> 01:13:04.214
<v Speaker 2>Is that what happened?</v>

3510
01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:05.750
<v Speaker 2>It was there where I live.</v>

3511
01:13:05.751 --> 01:13:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Like it's weird.</v>

3512
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:08.840
<v Speaker 2>So I have like a private drive from my house.</v>

3513
01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.610
<v Speaker 2>You can't see my house off the driveway.</v>

3514
01:13:10.611 --> 01:13:11.600
<v Speaker 2>So we have like a little pond.</v>

3515
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:13.080
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah.</v>

3516
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:14.180
<v Speaker 2>But were they there before?</v>

3517
01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.193
<v Speaker 2>They're always been there.</v>

3518
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:17.720
<v Speaker 2>They go back and forth a little pond next to it.</v>

3519
01:13:17.721 --> 01:13:19.550
<v Speaker 2>That connected where our drivers cook 'em up.</v>

3520
01:13:19.551 --> 01:13:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Turtle soup recipe,</v>

3521
01:13:21.190 --> 01:13:22.490
<v Speaker 2>half decent if you cook it right.</v>

3522
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:24.310
<v Speaker 2>What is your diet like?</v>

3523
01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:25.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3524
01:13:25.730 --> 01:13:26.750
<v Speaker 2>usual pizza,</v>

3525
01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:27.613
<v Speaker 2>beer.</v>

3526
01:13:28.930 --> 01:13:30.250
<v Speaker 3>I frowned upon that.</v>

3527
01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:30.611
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3528
01:13:30.611 --> 01:13:31.630
<v Speaker 3>I joked around about that,</v>

3529
01:13:31.631 --> 01:13:33.230
<v Speaker 3>but we had Courtney [inaudible],</v>

3530
01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:36.970
<v Speaker 3>she's a woman who won the Moab to 40 oh Yay.</v>

3531
01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Check is a fucking savage.</v>

3532
01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:41.950
<v Speaker 3>She beat every man,</v>

3533
01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:45.370
<v Speaker 3>every person who entered that race by a marathon length,</v>

3534
01:13:45.970 --> 01:13:48.820
<v Speaker 3>240 miles and she was,</v>

3535
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.920
<v Speaker 3>she was ahead by more than 20 miles.</v>

3536
01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:51.940
<v Speaker 3>The next person,</v>

3537
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:55.150
<v Speaker 3>the second place person was more than 20 miles behind her when she won.</v>

3538
01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:57.400
<v Speaker 3>So he's just like an ultra marathon.</v>

3539
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3540
01:13:57.820 --> 01:13:58.150
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3541
01:13:58.150 --> 01:14:00.070
<v Speaker 3>To three days for some people.</v>

3542
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.851
<v Speaker 3>But for her,</v>

3543
01:14:00.851 --> 01:14:02.830
<v Speaker 3>she did it and I think she did it in too.</v>

3544
01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:03.510
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3545
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.851
<v Speaker 3>Cause she,</v>

3546
01:14:03.851 --> 01:14:04.684
<v Speaker 3>she's an animal.</v>

3547
01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:05.531
<v Speaker 3>She's a fucking animal.</v>

3548
01:14:05.531 --> 01:14:06.310
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

3549
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.940
<v Speaker 3>beer,</v>

3550
01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:07.773
<v Speaker 3>Nachos,</v>

3551
01:14:07.930 --> 01:14:08.763
<v Speaker 3>candy.</v>

3552
01:14:08.850 --> 01:14:09.683
<v Speaker 3>That's what she eats.</v>

3553
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Beer and Nachos and,</v>

3554
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.981
<v Speaker 3>and we were like,</v>

3555
01:14:11.981 --> 01:14:12.510
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3556
01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:16.270
<v Speaker 3>Like I expected some sophisticated Kenogenic diet protocol where they're</v>

3557
01:14:16.271 --> 01:14:21.271
<v Speaker 3>monitoring or fucking or ketone levels in her blood and checking out.</v>

3558
01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.130
<v Speaker 3>All of our portions are mapped out.</v>

3559
01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:24.550
<v Speaker 3>Rago running around.</v>

3560
01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:25.871
<v Speaker 3>When she was here,</v>

3561
01:14:25.871 --> 01:14:26.980
<v Speaker 3>she just kept eating candy.</v>

3562
01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:29.470
<v Speaker 3>She was just eating candy like m and m's and shit.</v>

3563
01:14:31.450 --> 01:14:32.060
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

3564
01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:32.893
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3565
01:14:33.630 --> 01:14:34.463
<v Speaker 3>I kind of meals.</v>

3566
01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:35.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3567
01:14:35.111 --> 01:14:35.944
<v Speaker 3>those are great.</v>

3568
01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:37.993
<v Speaker 3>You get a meal prep?</v>

3569
01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:38.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3570
01:14:38.341 --> 01:14:39.490
<v Speaker 3>definitely send me a bunch of stuff.</v>

3571
01:14:39.491 --> 01:14:39.851
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

3572
01:14:39.851 --> 01:14:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3573
01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:40.400
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3574
01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.660
<v Speaker 3>but I am going to have you wait so long or you know.</v>

3575
01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3576
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3577
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.710
<v Speaker 3>on some days a lot pizza.</v>

3578
01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.160
<v Speaker 3>You can do whatever the fuck you want,</v>

3579
01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.320
<v Speaker 3>but I don't like,</v>

3580
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:49.870
<v Speaker 3>have you ever thought about trying to go to two oh five</v>

3581
01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:52.211
<v Speaker 3>we thought about it,</v>

3582
01:14:52.211 --> 01:14:53.380
<v Speaker 3>but I'd be really tough.</v>

3583
01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:54.273
<v Speaker 3>What do you weigh now?</v>

3584
01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:55.780
<v Speaker 3>To 40 yeah.</v>

3585
01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:56.800
<v Speaker 3>And you're not fat,</v>

3586
01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:58.210
<v Speaker 3>so what you like,</v>

3587
01:14:58.210 --> 01:14:59.470
<v Speaker 3>even if you got super lean,</v>

3588
01:14:59.471 --> 01:15:04.471
<v Speaker 3>you're probably looking at two 25 and then a hard cut to 25 classes all day.</v>

3589
01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:05.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3590
01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:05.831
<v Speaker 3>Easy mate.</v>

3591
01:15:05.831 --> 01:15:07.390
<v Speaker 3>That I think there should be one.</v>

3592
01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.253
<v Speaker 3>Me Too.</v>

3593
01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:10.360
<v Speaker 3>I think there should be a lot more weight classes.</v>

3594
01:15:10.361 --> 01:15:10.901
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

3595
01:15:10.901 --> 01:15:13.180
<v Speaker 3>And I know there's a resistance because they want to keep the spore pure.</v>

3596
01:15:13.181 --> 01:15:13.631
<v Speaker 3>They don't want it.</v>

3597
01:15:13.631 --> 01:15:16.420
<v Speaker 3>Like boxing was a weight class every four pounds.</v>

3598
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:18.610
<v Speaker 3>But I feel like if you look at guys,</v>

3599
01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:20.980
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of guys that I think are tweeners,</v>

3600
01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:21.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3601
01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:21.911
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

3602
01:15:21.911 --> 01:15:22.690
<v Speaker 3>they're not quite,</v>

3603
01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:22.930
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3604
01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:23.740
<v Speaker 3>well you're a heavyweight.</v>

3605
01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:24.770
<v Speaker 3>You can't say you're a trainer,</v>

3606
01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:28.270
<v Speaker 3>but you can't see the champ.</v>

3607
01:15:28.810 --> 01:15:29.890
<v Speaker 3>But this guys that,</v>

3608
01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:30.551
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3609
01:15:30.551 --> 01:15:32.530
<v Speaker 3>like Diego Sanchez was always a good example.</v>

3610
01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:37.090
<v Speaker 3>He's a little bit too small to make 55 when he tried to make 45 was a disaster</v>

3611
01:15:37.091 --> 01:15:37.924
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3612
01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.840
<v Speaker 3>but if there was a 65 pound weight class,</v>

3613
01:15:40.841 --> 01:15:41.980
<v Speaker 3>I think that's perfect for him.</v>

3614
01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:46.330
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of guys that like 70 to 85 that's a big jump.</v>

3615
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:48.510
<v Speaker 3>85 to two oh five that's crazy.</v>

3616
01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:49.600
<v Speaker 3>That's 20 pounds.</v>

3617
01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:50.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3618
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:53.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think definitely a few more weight classes.</v>

3619
01:15:53.171 --> 01:15:53.561
<v Speaker 3>Not like,</v>

3620
01:15:53.561 --> 01:15:54.330
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3621
01:15:54.330 --> 01:15:55.190
<v Speaker 3>every 10 pounds.</v>

3622
01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:55.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3623
01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.051
<v Speaker 3>I think I'd be great too.</v>

3624
01:15:56.051 --> 01:15:57.610
<v Speaker 3>I think I'd be on board for that.</v>

3625
01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3626
01:15:58.150 --> 01:15:59.770
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the move every 10 pounds.</v>

3627
01:15:59.771 --> 01:16:04.500
<v Speaker 3>And then when you go to o five two oh five to two 25 to 25 to,</v>

3628
01:16:04.730 --> 01:16:05.920
<v Speaker 3>it should be unlimited.</v>

3629
01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.390
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be to 65.</v>

3630
01:16:07.391 --> 01:16:08.530
<v Speaker 3>I know that seems silly to me,</v>

3631
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:11.280
<v Speaker 3>but I think that two of those guys that are unlimited that that,</v>

3632
01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:12.580
<v Speaker 3>that they won't last long,</v>

3633
01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:18.090
<v Speaker 3>they might not put in Ghana was cutting weight to get to two 65 way to 50 last</v>

3634
01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:18.410
<v Speaker 3>Friday I thought.</v>

3635
01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:18.880
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3636
01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:23.880
<v Speaker 3>no he weighed two 62 63 to 63 or [inaudible] 64 yeah,</v>

3637
01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:27.070
<v Speaker 3>no he's cutting weight.</v>

3638
01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:27.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh cool.</v>

3639
01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:28.593
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3640
01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:30.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3641
01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:35.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fellow but obviously there's pros and cons to being big.</v>

3642
01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:38.470
<v Speaker 3>And the con is that if you're getting into the third,</v>

3643
01:16:38.471 --> 01:16:39.550
<v Speaker 3>fourth and fifth rounds,</v>

3644
01:16:39.570 --> 01:16:40.060
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3645
01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.490
<v Speaker 3>You know those big guys are not known for their endurance.</v>

3646
01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:44.410
<v Speaker 3>Did they say that the weight class,</v>

3647
01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:47.500
<v Speaker 3>like there's like there was always a thought in MMA,</v>

3648
01:16:47.530 --> 01:16:49.240
<v Speaker 3>like when Cain Velasquez was on top,</v>

3649
01:16:49.241 --> 01:16:51.040
<v Speaker 3>there was a thought that that might be the perfect size,</v>

3650
01:16:51.041 --> 01:16:53.410
<v Speaker 3>like two 40 like anything bigger than that,</v>

3651
01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.880
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's just like not worth it.</v>

3652
01:16:54.881 --> 01:16:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Cause a 240 pound man cause basically knock out anybody on the planet.</v>

3653
01:16:58.560 --> 01:16:59.950
<v Speaker 3>And so the power is still there.</v>

3654
01:16:59.951 --> 01:17:02.440
<v Speaker 3>But you have more like nobody had more endurance and cane.</v>

3655
01:17:03.230 --> 01:17:03.450
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3656
01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:03.600
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3657
01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:03.981
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

3658
01:17:03.981 --> 01:17:04.391
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

3659
01:17:04.391 --> 01:17:05.980
<v Speaker 3>I think being at two 48 you just throw it out.</v>

3660
01:17:05.981 --> 01:17:06.361
<v Speaker 3>The curt here,</v>

3661
01:17:06.361 --> 01:17:07.750
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of the strengths or the speed.</v>

3662
01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:09.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's why I love be where I'm at.</v>

3663
01:17:09.441 --> 01:17:09.591
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3664
01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't</v>

3665
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:10.490
<v Speaker 1>try again.</v>

3666
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not going to trust you more than you ever thought about gaining or</v>

3667
01:17:13.530 --> 01:17:13.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3668
01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:14.180
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3669
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:14.330
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3670
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:14.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've,</v>

3671
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:15.711
<v Speaker 1>I've I've gained,</v>

3672
01:17:15.711 --> 01:17:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I remember why after mark on man I w I kind of went off the deep end and just</v>

3673
01:17:19.911 --> 01:17:22.460
<v Speaker 1>went on a binge drinking and finally me waiting for like living in an but of</v>

3674
01:17:22.461 --> 01:17:23.091
<v Speaker 1>life and I show,</v>

3675
01:17:23.091 --> 01:17:23.821
<v Speaker 1>I stepped on the scale.</v>

3676
01:17:23.821 --> 01:17:24.654
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3677
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:27.650
<v Speaker 1>what'd you want to 59 wow.</v>

3678
01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:28.670
<v Speaker 1>I never weighed in my life.</v>

3679
01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Do you take a picture like holding your gut?</v>

3680
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:30.591
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3681
01:17:30.591 --> 01:17:31.041
<v Speaker 1>I didn't actually.</v>

3682
01:17:31.041 --> 01:17:32.150
<v Speaker 1>I looked exactly the same.</v>

3683
01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I know that I just looked like a little bit thicker.</v>

3684
01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Nothing like bad though.</v>

3685
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:36.290
<v Speaker 1>So it filled out good.</v>

3686
01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3687
01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:37.041
<v Speaker 1>it was a good,</v>

3688
01:17:37.041 --> 01:17:37.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3689

3691
01:17:39.370 --> 01:17:40.220
<v Speaker 1>it would have been a good move.</v>

3692
01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3693
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:41.510
<v Speaker 1>I would have been working all day.</v>

3694
01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Don't totally rambled back to the whole ultra marathon thing.</v>

3695
01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:48.261
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a Weirdo.</v>

3696
01:17:48.261 --> 01:17:50.030
<v Speaker 1>And so I found out about watching marathons.</v>

3697
01:17:50.031 --> 01:17:52.340
<v Speaker 1>So I go on Wikipedia and I started reading all about it.</v>

3698
01:17:53.370 --> 01:17:54.021
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about,</v>

3699
01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:55.940
<v Speaker 1>and then I really like the top three guys.</v>

3700
01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Like they're crazy.</v>

3701
01:17:57.411 --> 01:17:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Like the one guy was like the first ever.</v>

3702
01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:01.330
<v Speaker 1>My argument of the guy like that did awesome was it's,</v>

3703
01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:05.390
<v Speaker 1>I can't a little runner kettle like guy cattle farmer guy,</v>

01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:08.001
<v Speaker 1>They run through the night.</v>

3706
01:18:08.001 --> 01:18:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Well he didn't sleep at night so he would just run and keep on it.</v>

01:21:18.061 --> 01:21:19.530
<v Speaker 2>And then it's an endurance.</v>

3854
01:21:19.531 --> 01:21:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Racing is a totally different kind of thing.</v>

3855
01:21:21.521 --> 01:21:23.070
<v Speaker 2>As far as like the mindset,</v>

3856
01:21:23.370 --> 01:21:26.700
<v Speaker 2>like if you think about a five round heavyweight title,</v>

3857
01:21:26.701 --> 01:21:28.410
<v Speaker 2>fight is a grueling affair,</v>

3858
01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:28.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3859
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:33.420
<v Speaker 2>It's 25 minutes of throwing bones at the best fighters in the world,</v>

3860
01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's still 25 minutes.</v>

3861
01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.900
<v Speaker 2>These mother fuckers like this,</v>

3864
01:21:39.450 --> 01:21:40.283
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

3865
01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:41.740
<v Speaker 5>What does it as a Dallas Marathon,</v>

3866
01:21:41.741 --> 01:21:42.940
<v Speaker 5>this was the lady that was winning.</v>

3867
01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.350
<v Speaker 5>She uh,</v>

3868
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:46.420
<v Speaker 5>got to the end and she just collapsed in this,</v>

3869
01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:47.380
<v Speaker 5>this girl helped her.</v>

3870
01:21:47.381 --> 01:21:48.460
<v Speaker 5>She's like a high schooler.</v>

3871
01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:51.550
<v Speaker 5>She was running one of the shorter races and just saw her and just like,</v>

3872
01:21:51.551 --> 01:21:52.870
<v Speaker 5>I was compelled to help her.</v>

3873
01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:53.920
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3874
01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:54.820
<v Speaker 5>Do you still won the race?</v>

3875
01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:55.421
<v Speaker 5>She's,</v>

3876
01:21:55.421 --> 01:21:55.810
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

3877
01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:56.260
<v Speaker 5>she was.</v>

3878
01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:58.870
<v Speaker 5>I guess the lady said she was afraid she was going to get disqualified because</v>

3879
01:21:58.871 --> 01:21:59.591
<v Speaker 5>someone was helping her,</v>

3880
01:21:59.591 --> 01:22:00.340
<v Speaker 5>but they still,</v>

3881
01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:01.110
<v Speaker 5>she still won.</v>

3882
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3883
01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:01.540
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

3884
01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:03.970
<v Speaker 2>We get at check some of that money so someone's helping her.</v>

3885
01:22:03.971 --> 01:22:04.960
<v Speaker 2>That seems weird.</v>

3886
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:07.290
<v Speaker 5>Sort of helping or you can kind of tell she doesn't really</v>

3887
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:08.490
<v Speaker 2>picking her up though.</v>

3888
01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:10.950
<v Speaker 2>She's picking her up every time she falls.</v>

3889
01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.990
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that's cheating.</v>

3890
01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.190
<v Speaker 2>They might've had some rules.</v>

3891
01:22:14.191 --> 01:22:14.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't listen.</v>

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be there without my coaches honestly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're just great people.</v>

4001
01:24:21.221 --> 01:24:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Of course there's just this one reason there just cause they put so much time</v>

4002
01:24:24.131 --> 01:24:24.670
<v Speaker 1>and effort into me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4058
01:25:21.630 --> 01:25:24.910
<v Speaker 1>and the guy really should be stepping away and then you see them,</v>

4059
01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:25.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4060
01:25:25.330 --> 01:25:27.560
<v Speaker 1>trying to give the guy the pep talk and you know,</v>

4061
01:25:27.610 --> 01:25:28.930
<v Speaker 1>the best days are in the past.</v>

4062
01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.820
<v Speaker 1>That's why mark is actually real good at that.</v>

4063
01:25:30.821 --> 01:25:30.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4064
01:25:30.971 --> 01:25:32.620
<v Speaker 1>we've got a couple of guys that were like,</v>

4065
01:25:32.621 --> 01:25:33.100
<v Speaker 1>I want to get down.</v>

4066
01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:33.933
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4067
01:25:34.150 --> 01:25:34.391
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

4068
01:25:34.391 --> 01:25:34.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4069
01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:35.590
<v Speaker 1>and you'd be in your corner.</v>

4070
01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:36.071
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4071
01:25:36.071 --> 01:25:36.240
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4072
01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:36.820
<v Speaker 1>she retire.</v>

4073
01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4074
01:25:36.970 --> 01:25:37.803
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was,</v>

4075
01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.970
<v Speaker 1>he really killed them inside to tell him that.</v>

4076
01:25:39.971 --> 01:25:40.241
<v Speaker 1>But he's like,</v>

4077
01:25:40.241 --> 01:25:40.540
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

4078
01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:41.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4079
01:25:41.490 --> 01:25:41.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4080
01:25:41.890 --> 01:25:42.371
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

4081
01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:44.130
<v Speaker 1>this is an important point to talk,</v>

4082
01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:47.260
<v Speaker 1>but you remember that feeling that you felt like after this true fight,</v>

4083
01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:51.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like you've got to kind of figure that out on your own and come back on</v>

4084
01:25:51.431 --> 01:25:52.264
<v Speaker 1>your own.</v>

4085
01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:53.133
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4086
01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.580
<v Speaker 1>And some guys,</v>

4087
01:25:55.090 --> 01:25:57.880
<v Speaker 1>they have that feeling and then they're never,</v>

4088
01:25:57.881 --> 01:25:59.200
<v Speaker 1>they're set those same again.</v>

4089
01:25:59.230 --> 01:26:04.230
<v Speaker 1>They never reached those same like you got better for sure you rose above that.</v>

4090
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:10.030
<v Speaker 1>But some people are dwarfed by bad performances or a bad knock out or whatever</v>

4091
01:26:10.311 --> 01:26:10.611
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

4092
01:26:10.611 --> 01:26:11.444
<v Speaker 1>And they just never,</v>

4093
01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:12.590
<v Speaker 1>they never the same again.</v>

4094
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:13.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4095
01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:13.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just,</v>

4096
01:26:13.761 --> 01:26:14.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

4097
01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:14.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4098
01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:15.350
<v Speaker 1>there's two types.</v>

4099
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:17.810
<v Speaker 1>People are either going to be going above and beyond it or not.</v>

4100
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:18.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4101
01:26:18.141 --> 01:26:18.974
<v Speaker 1>that's just how it is.</v>

4102
01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:20.810
<v Speaker 1>But there's also stages in your life too,</v>

4103
01:26:20.811 --> 01:26:21.081
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

4104
01:26:21.081 --> 01:26:22.520
<v Speaker 1>where you just don't want to do it anymore.</v>

4105
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Like you see some guys who at one point in time,</v>

4106
01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:28.660
<v Speaker 1>great driven fighters and then the grind just gets to them.</v>

4107
01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4108
01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4109
01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4110
01:26:29.850 --> 01:26:30.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4111
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I told understanding like,</v>

4112
01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:32.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4113
01:26:32.050 --> 01:26:33.130
<v Speaker 1>I was just talking to her.</v>

4114
01:26:33.131 --> 01:26:34.710
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about this volante.</v>

4115
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4116
01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:37.010
<v Speaker 1>It seems less,</v>

4117
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:37.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4118
01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I've had 11 UFC fights,</v>

4119
01:26:40.341 --> 01:26:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I think more than level of Lowe's or been five rounder.</v>

4120
01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:43.830
<v Speaker 1>I would train for five hours.</v>

4121
01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:44.750
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

4122
01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:45.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4123
01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:46.603
<v Speaker 1>My third,</v>

4124
01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:51.710
<v Speaker 1>my fourth UFC fire was a five rounder.</v>

4125
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:53.091
<v Speaker 1>Did.</v>

4126
01:26:53.091 --> 01:26:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Even if they didn't go five rounds,</v>

4127
01:26:54.531 --> 01:26:55.730
<v Speaker 1>you're still doing training for fire.</v>

4128
01:26:55.731 --> 01:26:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4129
01:26:55.950 --> 01:26:57.560
<v Speaker 1>You're doing a camp for five rounds.</v>

4130
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:58.423
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4131
01:26:58.730 --> 01:26:59.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4132
01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.013
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4133
01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:00.791
<v Speaker 1>Ever since diff,</v>

4134
01:27:00.791 --> 01:27:04.910
<v Speaker 1>a dune fight was so crazy because I almost think you benefited from it being in</v>

4135
01:27:04.911 --> 01:27:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Brazil because it seemed like for doom was so emotional.</v>

4136
01:27:09.291 --> 01:27:11.420
<v Speaker 1>It's so ramped up because it was in Brazil.</v>

4137
01:27:11.421 --> 01:27:13.040
<v Speaker 1>He's like chase and after you,</v>

4138
01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:13.881
<v Speaker 1>which I was like,</v>

4139
01:27:13.881 --> 01:27:14.900
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

4140
01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4141
01:27:15.170 --> 01:27:16.370
<v Speaker 1>I think a little bit too is that,</v>

4142
01:27:16.371 --> 01:27:16.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4143
01:27:16.551 --> 01:27:19.400
<v Speaker 1>we knew exactly what was going to do and she did and everything he wanted to do</v>

4144
01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:22.580
<v Speaker 1>and I just wasn't falling for anything you wanted for a flying knee.</v>

4145
01:27:22.590 --> 01:27:23.550
<v Speaker 1>You went for a take down,</v>

4146
01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:25.130
<v Speaker 1>you want it for a body kick.</v>

4147
01:27:25.131 --> 01:27:26.440
<v Speaker 1>I just wasn't giving me anything you wanted,</v>

4148
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4149
01:27:26.751 --> 01:27:29.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you realize that it wasn't going anywhere.</v>

4150
01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:31.930
<v Speaker 1>You also caught him before that big punch to yeah,</v>

4151
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:34.970
<v Speaker 1>when we watched the fight we did a fight can pan and we've watched the fight.</v>

4152
01:27:35.150 --> 01:27:36.620
<v Speaker 1>You clipped him early and I was like,</v>

4153
01:27:36.621 --> 01:27:37.410
<v Speaker 1>he's hurt.</v>

4154
01:27:37.410 --> 01:27:39.800
<v Speaker 1>You could tell there was something going on.</v>

4155
01:27:39.801 --> 01:27:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Like when he got hit,</v>

4156
01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:41.630
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4157
01:27:41.630 --> 01:27:45.470
<v Speaker 1>and then he tried to get it back and you know when a guy gets hit and then just</v>

4158
01:27:45.471 --> 01:27:46.910
<v Speaker 1>try extra hard to get it back.</v>

4159
01:27:46.911 --> 01:27:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of times they're exposed and he just caught that right hand.</v>

4160
01:27:50.091 --> 01:27:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

4161
01:27:50.670 --> 01:27:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4162
01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:51.853
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4163
01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:52.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4164
01:27:52.210 --> 01:27:53.330
<v Speaker 1>I heard it wouldn't be here right now.</v>

4165
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:54.770
<v Speaker 1>What was that feeling like?</v>

4166
01:27:54.771 --> 01:27:55.604
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>

4167
01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

4168
01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:57.320
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4169
01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:58.690
<v Speaker 1>so when I hit him to any phone,</v>

4170
01:27:58.700 --> 01:27:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4171
01:27:59.060 --> 01:27:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

4172
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:03.520
<v Speaker 1>He fell because I was the last time he's been knocked out like that.</v>

4173
01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:04.363
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4174
01:28:04.450 --> 01:28:07.870
<v Speaker 1>He was out like junior was the last real early on.</v>

4175
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:08.210
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4176
01:28:08.210 --> 01:28:08.930
<v Speaker 1>he's on a tear.</v>

4177
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:09.141
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4178
01:28:09.141 --> 01:28:09.621
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

4179
01:28:09.621 --> 01:28:11.750
<v Speaker 1>So I gave me a couple extra one.</v>

4180
01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4181
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:12.741
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

4182
01:28:12.741 --> 01:28:13.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4183
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:13.903
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4184
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I stopped the fight and I was,</v>

4185
01:28:15.231 --> 01:28:15.631
<v Speaker 1>I looked at her,</v>

4186
01:28:15.631 --> 01:28:16.490
<v Speaker 1>I saw my coach was like,</v>

4187
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh hell yeah.</v>

4188
01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4189
01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:18.471
<v Speaker 1>run over.</v>

4190
01:28:18.471 --> 01:28:19.150
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

4191
01:28:19.150 --> 01:28:19.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4192
01:28:19.401 --> 01:28:20.360
<v Speaker 1>like no one heard it before that.</v>

4193
01:28:20.361 --> 01:28:21.470
<v Speaker 1>But before I said,</v>

4194
01:28:21.471 --> 01:28:22.221
<v Speaker 1>I'm a world champ,</v>

4195
01:28:22.221 --> 01:28:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I looked at my coach and like,</v>

4196
01:28:23.091 --> 01:28:23.631
<v Speaker 1>we did it.</v>

4197
01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:24.141
<v Speaker 1>We did it,</v>

4198
01:28:24.141 --> 01:28:24.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4199
01:28:24.341 --> 01:28:25.101
<v Speaker 1>that's what I told him I was,</v>

4200
01:28:25.101 --> 01:28:25.934

01:30:53.850 --> 01:30:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4334
01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:56.810
<v Speaker 1>the historically inboxing,</v>

4335
01:30:56.811 --> 01:30:59.370
<v Speaker 1>they've always said that the health of the heavyweight division,</v>

4336
01:30:59.390 --> 01:31:01.410
<v Speaker 1>it just represents like boxing overall.</v>

4337
01:31:01.411 --> 01:31:03.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the case anymore because now I'm boxing.</v>

4338

4343
01:31:14.190 --> 01:31:15.023
<v Speaker 1>Andre Ward.</v>

4344
01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:18.300
<v Speaker 1>But I think in the heavyweight division that UFC,</v>

4345
01:31:18.770 --> 01:31:19.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

01:31:49.111 --> 01:31:49.681
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of guys,</v>

4385
01:31:49.681 --> 01:31:50.514
<v Speaker 1>they had a hard,</v>

4386
01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4387
01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:51.360

01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:53.490
<v Speaker 1>there's no question and you guys hit hard.</v>

4390
01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4391
01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:55.620
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to knock to be stupid.</v>

4392
01:31:55.621 --> 01:31:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Put myself in a position where I'm going to get hit.</v>

4393
01:31:57.211 --> 01:31:57.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4394
01:31:57.390 --> 01:32:00.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do things that make him feel uncomfortable and</v>

4395
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:00.941
<v Speaker 3>won't do what I'm going to do.</v>

4396
01:32:00.941 --> 01:32:02.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to sit there and let him do what he wants.</v>

4397
01:32:02.501 --> 01:32:04.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to dictate what I want.</v>

4398
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:07.720
<v Speaker 3>When you see the rest of the heavyweight division,</v>

4399
01:32:07.930 --> 01:32:11.410
<v Speaker 3>do you see any standouts or any guys that are coming up that are exciting to</v>

4400
01:32:11.411 --> 01:32:12.030
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>

4401
01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:12.863
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4402
01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:14.550
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>

4403
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:15.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't pay,</v>

4404
01:32:15.010 --> 01:32:15.843
<v Speaker 3>you don't pay attention.</v>

4405
01:32:16.110 --> 01:32:16.930
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

4406
01:32:16.930 --> 01:32:19.710
<v Speaker 3>that's a fascinating thing because some people deal,</v>

4407
01:32:19.730 --> 01:32:19.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4408
01:32:19.971 --> 01:32:24.700
<v Speaker 3>like I talked to Matt Hughes after and Matt Hughes got beat by Bj Penn and this</v>

4409
01:32:24.701 --> 01:32:25.211
<v Speaker 3>is what he said.</v>

4410
01:32:25.211 --> 01:32:27.010
<v Speaker 3>It was really fascinating because he had,</v>

4411
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:31.840
<v Speaker 3>he's got so much courage that guy like to say to say this in an interview as</v>

4412
01:32:31.841 --> 01:32:32.081
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

4413
01:32:32.081 --> 01:32:32.381
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

4414
01:32:32.381 --> 01:32:32.921
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>

4415
01:32:32.921 --> 01:32:33.760
<v Speaker 3>it's a relief.</v>

4416
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:34.721
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

4417
01:32:34.721 --> 01:32:37.030
<v Speaker 3>being the champ was like so much pressure.</v>

4418
01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:37.571
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>

4419
01:32:37.571 --> 01:32:38.980
<v Speaker 3>it's overwhelming.</v>

4420
01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.300
<v Speaker 3>So having this happen,</v>

4421
01:32:40.301 --> 01:32:40.721
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>

4422
01:32:40.721 --> 01:32:42.790
<v Speaker 3>right now I feel relieved and I was like,</v>

4423
01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:43.541
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

4424
01:32:43.541 --> 01:32:44.380
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

4425
01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:45.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4426
01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:46.990
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you gave up and he fought his heart out,</v>

4427
01:32:46.991 --> 01:32:49.000
<v Speaker 3>but he got caught and got choked out.</v>

4428
01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:51.010
<v Speaker 3>And then to go from that to say,</v>

4429
01:32:51.011 --> 01:32:51.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4430
01:32:51.281 --> 01:32:51.671
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>

4431
01:32:51.671 --> 01:32:53.500
<v Speaker 3>he's really then rebounds,</v>

4432
01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:55.390
<v Speaker 3>then gets back on the horse and you know,</v>

4433
01:32:55.391 --> 01:33:00.391
<v Speaker 3>probably had to have that experience just to have the perspective that more,</v>

4434
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:02.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he ever had the perspective that you have,</v>

4435
01:33:02.981 --> 01:33:06.190
<v Speaker 3>but your perspective is different in that you like,</v>

4436
01:33:06.191 --> 01:33:08.380
<v Speaker 3>you don't seem to be concerned.</v>

4437
01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:09.161
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4438
01:33:09.161 --> 01:33:10.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm concerned.</v>

4439
01:33:10.061 --> 01:33:10.781
<v Speaker 3>There's no question.</v>

4440
01:33:10.781 --> 01:33:11.614
<v Speaker 3>I think every Friday,</v>

4441
01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:11.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4442
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:12.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm nervous,</v>

4443
01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:15.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm always never know what's gonna happen.</v>

4444
01:33:15.121 --> 01:33:15.590
<v Speaker 3>And that's what,</v>

4445
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4446
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:17.440
<v Speaker 3>as real as the guest because you never know what's going to happen.</v>

4447
01:33:17.650 --> 01:33:19.990
<v Speaker 3>But you're not concerned at all these guys nipping at your heels.</v>

4448
01:33:19.991 --> 01:33:21.280
<v Speaker 3>All these guys coming up the ladder.</v>

4449
01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:22.260
<v Speaker 3>It's part of the game.</v>

4450
01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:23.170
<v Speaker 3>It's what I signed up for.</v>

4451
01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:24.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4452
01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:25.490
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4453
01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:26.323
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>

4454
01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:27.550
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't want to do it,</v>

4455
01:33:27.551 --> 01:33:28.211
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do it.</v>

4456
01:33:28.211 --> 01:33:28.361
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4457
01:33:28.361 --> 01:33:28.980
<v Speaker 3>I knew that,</v>

4458
01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:29.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4459
01:33:29.201 --> 01:33:30.190
<v Speaker 3>one day I'll be the champion.</v>

4460
01:33:30.191 --> 01:33:31.720
<v Speaker 3>I knew there were people who come from my built.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4463
01:33:33.131 --> 01:33:33.401
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

4464
01:33:33.401 --> 01:33:36.640
<v Speaker 3>and you know there's a lot of good guys out there that I mean,</v>

4465
01:33:36.641 --> 01:33:36.911
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4466

<v Speaker 3>I mean they all want a piece of it,</v>

4471
01:33:42.521 --> 01:33:42.631
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4472
01:33:42.631 --> 01:33:45.430
<v Speaker 3>I understand that no matter who it is and it's not even you just meet it says</v>

4473
01:33:45.431 --> 01:33:46.660
<v Speaker 3>whoever it may when Kane was fighting,</v>

4474
01:33:46.661 --> 01:33:48.880
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to overdo them.</v>

4475
01:33:48.881 --> 01:33:49.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4476

<v Speaker 3>Well you know,</v>

4478
01:33:50.921 --> 01:33:54.550
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting thing too because what we're seeing today with MMA,</v>

4479
01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:59.320
<v Speaker 3>we're seeing this combination like this marriage of fighting with promotion.</v>

4480
01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:00.213
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it.</v>

4481
01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:00.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4482
01:34:00.551 --> 01:34:01.390
<v Speaker 3>you're not that guy.</v>

4483
01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:02.140
<v Speaker 3>I hate it.</v>

4484
01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:02.470
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

4485

<v Speaker 3>but you not being,</v>

4486
01:34:03.791 --> 01:34:05.620
<v Speaker 3>that guy is promotable.</v>

4487
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.090
<v Speaker 3>This is what it's like.</v>

4488
01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:08.373
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like,</v>

4489
01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:08.980
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4490
01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:09.611
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

4491
01:34:09.611 --> 01:34:14.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the UFC has enough resources to promote every fighter adequately.</v>

4492
01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:18.130
<v Speaker 3>Cause I think UFC is a promotional entity,</v>

4493
01:34:18.131 --> 01:34:20.420
<v Speaker 3>but it's also like this sanctioning body,</v>

4494
01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:20.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4495
01:34:20.591 --> 01:34:21.130
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

4496
01:34:21.130 --> 01:34:22.000
<v Speaker 3>not the sanctioning body,</v>

4497
01:34:22.001 --> 01:34:23.830
<v Speaker 3>but they're the ones who put on the fights.</v>

4498
01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:28.990
<v Speaker 3>They're the ones who decide who fights and you've got a 500 fighter roster.</v>

4499
01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.960
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like in other organizations you would have a,</v>

4500
01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:33.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4501
01:34:33.150 --> 01:34:36.550
<v Speaker 3>you would have a bunch of different venues and avenues for different fighters.</v>

4502
01:34:36.551 --> 01:34:40.000
<v Speaker 3>Could go when a guy like you is the heavyweight champion,</v>

4503
01:34:41.290 --> 01:34:44.170
<v Speaker 3>blue collar guy works as a firefighter.</v>

4504
01:34:44.410 --> 01:34:44.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4505
01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.000
<v Speaker 3>you've got a great story,</v>

4506
01:34:46.210 --> 01:34:47.260
<v Speaker 3>you're a fun guy.</v>

4507
01:34:47.710 --> 01:34:52.370
<v Speaker 3>Like does it frustrate you that people expect you to talk shit and,</v>

4508
01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:53.121
<v Speaker 3>and get,</v>

4509
01:34:53.121 --> 01:34:53.631
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

4510
01:34:53.631 --> 01:34:57.070
<v Speaker 3>you've seen all these guys that are getting a lot of attention now for obviously</v>

4511
01:34:57.090 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Conners the master</v>

4512
01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:58.251
<v Speaker 1>at it,</v>

4513
01:34:58.251 --> 01:34:58.431
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4514
01:34:58.431 --> 01:34:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4515
01:34:58.970 --> 01:35:00.860
<v Speaker 1>But you're seeing other guys that are,</v>

4516
01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:01.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4517
01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:02.660
<v Speaker 1>trying that route,</v>

4518
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:05.930
<v Speaker 1>trying to say outrageous shit to try to get attention,</v>

4519
01:35:05.931 --> 01:35:06.530
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

4520
01:35:06.530 --> 01:35:06.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4521
01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:08.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be a copy cat.</v>

4522
01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4523
01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:13.040
<v Speaker 1>it's too exhausting for me to figure out what I'm willing to say and like what I</v>

4524
01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:14.270
<v Speaker 1>want to say and hurt someone's feelings.</v>

4525
01:35:14.271 --> 01:35:14.751
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>

4526
01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:15.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

4527
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:17.720
<v Speaker 1>And like I got more important shit to worry about.</v>

4528
01:35:17.721 --> 01:35:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4529
01:35:17.890 --> 01:35:18.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4530
01:35:18.150 --> 01:35:18.861
<v Speaker 1>like my kitchen,</v>

4531
01:35:18.861 --> 01:35:19.970
<v Speaker 1>I had to figure out to fix that.</v>

4532
01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:20.121
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4533
01:35:20.121 --> 01:35:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4534
01:35:20.710 --> 01:35:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I need to worry about that.</v>

4535
01:35:21.561 --> 01:35:24.530
<v Speaker 1>And you knew at a new worry about like what next I was in a fight was going to</v>

4536
01:35:24.531 --> 01:35:25.460
<v Speaker 1>say what was going to say to my,</v>

4537
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:26.210
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4540
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go on there.</v>

4541
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:29.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to beat your ass.</v>

4542
01:35:29.841 --> 01:35:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna walk out.</v>

4543
01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:31.493
<v Speaker 1>I'm the champ.</v>

4544
01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:34.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm torn because on one hand I'm like,</v>

4545
01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.740
<v Speaker 1>I love a good shit talking session.</v>

4546
01:35:36.741 --> 01:35:37.311
<v Speaker 1>I like shit.</v>

4547
01:35:37.311 --> 01:35:38.071
<v Speaker 1>Talking like this.</v>

4548
01:35:38.071 --> 01:35:39.320
<v Speaker 1>And even at the fire station all day,</v>

4549
01:35:39.321 --> 01:35:39.561
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4550
01:35:39.561 --> 01:35:40.840
<v Speaker 1>I thought I should talk to the bathroom,</v>

4551
01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:41.061
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4552
01:35:41.061 --> 01:35:41.331
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

4553
01:35:41.331 --> 01:35:43.340
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to go home away and just put someone's feelings.</v>

4554
01:35:43.341 --> 01:35:44.174
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>

4555
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4556
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:46.100
<v Speaker 1>But like Colby Covington,</v>

4557
01:35:46.101 --> 01:35:47.420
<v Speaker 1>like he's making a name for himself,</v>

4558
01:35:47.421 --> 01:35:48.410
<v Speaker 1>but he's making a name for himself,</v>

4559
01:35:48.411 --> 01:35:50.510
<v Speaker 1>not just beating good guys like Damien Maia,</v>

4560
01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:52.400
<v Speaker 1>but talking mad shit.</v>

4561
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4562
01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:54.370
<v Speaker 1>like talking shit in Brazil.</v>

4563
01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:55.680
<v Speaker 1>You see only for resale we're doing,</v>

4564
01:35:55.681 --> 01:35:56.640
<v Speaker 1>we hit him in the head with it</v>

4565
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:59.840
<v Speaker 1>because he had to go to court for that.</v>

4566
01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:03.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that I go to corporate and I think a couple of weeks he's got to fly all</v>

4567
01:36:03.441 --> 01:36:04.970
<v Speaker 1>the way to Australia to go to court for that.</v>

4568
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.470
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to let it go.</v>

4569
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Fucking bowling.</v>

4570
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:09.423
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4571
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:11.930
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't trying to hit him.</v>

4572
01:36:11.931 --> 01:36:12.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean it wasn't trying to kill him.</v>

4573
01:36:12.921 --> 01:36:14.660
<v Speaker 1>He just threw whatever he had in his hands.</v>

4574
01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:15.290
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

4575
01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:16.123
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty sweet though.</v>

4576
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

4577
01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Give him a little fun in Australia.</v>

4578
01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4579
01:36:19.630 --> 01:36:20.150
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

4580
01:36:20.150 --> 01:36:20.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4581
01:36:20.361 --> 01:36:21.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like hitting someone the head with a Koala bear.</v>

4582
01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:22.933
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4583
01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:25.070
<v Speaker 1>A bottle of vegemite or something like that.</v>

4584
01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

4585

4586
01:36:26.841 --> 01:36:27.674
<v Speaker 1>So salty.</v>

4587
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:28.663
<v Speaker 1>I like that stuff.</v>

4588
01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:29.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4589
01:36:29.151 --> 01:36:29.984
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

4590
01:36:30.230 --> 01:36:30.861
<v Speaker 1>I did one time,</v>

4591
01:36:30.861 --> 01:36:32.450
<v Speaker 1>it was so salty as good with butter,</v>

4592
01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:34.160
<v Speaker 1>with butter on bread.</v>

4593
01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4594
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:36.140

01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:36.920
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4596
01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:37.581
<v Speaker 1>that thing,</v>

4597
01:36:37.581 --> 01:36:42.050
<v Speaker 1>like has there been any pressure on you to try to talk some shit to try to like</v>

4598
01:36:42.051 --> 01:36:43.580
<v Speaker 1>promote things more?</v>

4599
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:44.390
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4600
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:46.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean dude telling me like,</v>

4601
01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:47.820
<v Speaker 1>you're your own promoter.</v>

4602
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:48.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4603
01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:48.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4604
01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:48.950
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4605
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:49.783
<v Speaker 1>That's what they say to you.</v>

4606
01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Like how does the UFC say it?</v>

4607
01:36:51.221 --> 01:36:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4608
01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:51.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4609
01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:51.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4610
01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:52.593
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just,</v>

4611
01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:53.570
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

4612
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:56.510
<v Speaker 1>like I don't really care what they think.</v>

4613
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:56.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4614
01:36:56.611 --> 01:36:58.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do like promoting like I promote myself.</v>

4615
01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:01.070
<v Speaker 1>That's why you guys are in a promoting company.</v>

4616
01:37:01.071 --> 01:37:01.851
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're supposed to do.</v>

4617
01:37:01.851 --> 01:37:02.511
<v Speaker 1>You guys do that,</v>

4618
01:37:02.511 --> 01:37:02.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4619
01:37:02.761 --> 01:37:03.590
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

4620
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4621
01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:04.461
<v Speaker 1>I think they'd rather,</v>

4622
01:37:04.461 --> 01:37:05.294
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4623
01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:06.410
<v Speaker 1>50 50 with it,</v>

4624
01:37:06.411 --> 01:37:07.640
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see it that way.</v>

4625
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4626
01:37:08.421 --> 01:37:11.840
<v Speaker 1>I think they would rather someone who's just promotes themselves.</v>

4627
01:37:11.850 --> 01:37:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Like Conor McGregor is a preppy example,</v>

4628
01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:14.900
<v Speaker 1>but he's a fucking Unicorn.</v>

4629
01:37:15.190 --> 01:37:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Like every now and then one guy comes along that has,</v>

4630
01:37:18.141 --> 01:37:18.591
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

4631
01:37:18.591 --> 01:37:18.681
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4632
01:37:18.681 --> 01:37:20.060
<v Speaker 1>it was it an entire country behind him.</v>

4633
01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd never seen anything like that.</v>

4634
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Like Ireland is on a big country,</v>

4635
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:25.910
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like they're the biggest country in the world.</v>

4636
01:37:25.911 --> 01:37:28.250
<v Speaker 1>When is fighting and he's fighting in Vegas.</v>

4637
01:37:28.251 --> 01:37:30.680
<v Speaker 1>It gets an American and there's more Irish people in the audience.</v>

4638
01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:30.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4639
01:37:30.951 --> 01:37:31.880
<v Speaker 1>that's just bananas,</v>

4640
01:37:31.881 --> 01:37:32.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4641
01:37:32.690 --> 01:37:34.760
<v Speaker 1>But when they got a guy like that,</v>

4642
01:37:34.761 --> 01:37:35.750
<v Speaker 1>they kind of get spoiled.</v>

4643
01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:36.141
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4644
01:37:36.141 --> 01:37:36.351
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4645
01:37:36.351 --> 01:37:36.491
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

4646
01:37:36.491 --> 01:37:37.760
<v Speaker 1>this is the how you got to do it.</v>

4647
01:37:37.761 --> 01:37:38.810
<v Speaker 1>You gotta do like Connor does it.</v>

4648
01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Well not everybody's Connor,</v>

4649
01:37:41.210 --> 01:37:41.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4650
01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:46.960
<v Speaker 1>so like for a guy like you to see all these guys getting a lot of attention and</v>

4651
01:37:47.991 --> 01:37:51.650
<v Speaker 1>they're very good fighters as well until Congress case great fighters as well.</v>

4652
01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:54.890
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is the shit talking like that.</v>

4653
01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:56.820
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of what's ramping everything up.</v>

4654
01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:59.010
<v Speaker 1>That's what's getting all these people to buy the paper view.</v>

4655
01:37:59.160 --> 01:37:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4656
01:37:59.550 --> 01:37:59.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4657
01:37:59.821 --> 01:38:01.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean if someone came at me,</v>

4658
01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:01.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4659
01:38:01.690 --> 01:38:02.820
<v Speaker 1>you're forced to defend myself.</v>

4660
01:38:02.821 --> 01:38:03.654
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty ready.</v>

4661
01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm a fireman.</v>

4662
01:38:04.951 --> 01:38:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I get shit talked to her day by you know,</v>

4663
01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:08.581
<v Speaker 1>five or six guys.</v>

4664
01:38:08.581 --> 01:38:09.700
<v Speaker 1>So like I got,</v>

4665
01:38:09.701 --> 01:38:10.081
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

4666
01:38:10.081 --> 01:38:11.190
<v Speaker 1>like I just want to go home away and just,</v>

4667
01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:11.970
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

4668
01:38:11.970 --> 01:38:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I have other stuff to worry about like training wise and like,</v>

4669
01:38:13.891 --> 01:38:15.450
<v Speaker 1>and what am I going to tweet today when I went,</v>

4670
01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:18.270
<v Speaker 1>when it was too much made jail sentence.</v>

4671
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Career.</v>

4672
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:19.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4673
01:38:19.141 --> 01:38:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think than being a great fighter,</v>

4674
01:38:20.610 --> 01:38:25.080
<v Speaker 1>but I did chills like career really took off when he started talking shit.</v>

4675
01:38:25.410 --> 01:38:27.420
<v Speaker 1>If people remember chill in the early days of his career,</v>

4676
01:38:27.421 --> 01:38:28.021
<v Speaker 1>he was a gentleman.</v>

4677
01:38:28.021 --> 01:38:28.854
<v Speaker 1>He never talked shit,</v>

4678
01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:30.960
<v Speaker 1>but then somewhere along the line he's like,</v>

4679
01:38:30.961 --> 01:38:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva,</v>

4680
01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:37.490
<v Speaker 1>you absolutely suck my belt and it's like a WWE promotion and everybody's going</v>

4681
01:38:39.151 --> 01:38:41.490
<v Speaker 1>crazy and shale took it to a new level,</v>

4682
01:38:41.730 --> 01:38:45.030
<v Speaker 1>like jail opened up the door to a lot of shit.</v>

4683
01:38:45.031 --> 01:38:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Talkers of the modern era.</v>

4684
01:38:46.530 --> 01:38:47.850
<v Speaker 1>It really let them know like,</v>

4685
01:38:47.851 --> 01:38:48.121
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4686
01:38:48.121 --> 01:38:50.300
<v Speaker 1>the guy promoted the fuck out of here.</v>

4687
01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Take classes or any of that.</v>

4688
01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:53.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to be funny.</v>

4689
01:38:53.371 --> 01:38:53.511
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4690
01:38:53.511 --> 01:38:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's just very smart.</v>

4691
01:38:54.990 --> 01:38:55.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4692
01:38:55.181 --> 01:38:55.741
<v Speaker 1>we talked to him.</v>

4693
01:38:55.741 --> 01:38:55.891
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4694
01:38:55.891 --> 01:38:56.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4695
01:38:56.041 --> 01:38:56.874
<v Speaker 1>he's very intelligent,</v>

4696
01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:57.773
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>

4697
01:38:57.870 --> 01:38:59.070
<v Speaker 1>I did a couple of his radio shows.</v>

4698
01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Exceptionally smart and very articulate,</v>

4699
01:39:02.791 --> 01:39:03.630
<v Speaker 1>very.</v>

4700
01:39:03.630 --> 01:39:06.870
<v Speaker 1>He's got a great vocabulary and just knows right there.</v>

4701
01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:07.801
<v Speaker 1>I have no vocabulary.</v>

4702
01:39:07.801 --> 01:39:08.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm at articulate.</v>

4703
01:39:08.671 --> 01:39:10.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm the year you get just,</v>

4704
01:39:11.250 --> 01:39:13.800
<v Speaker 1>I think I always said that like people just need to,</v>

4705
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4706
01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:16.470
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like there's no way.</v>

4707
01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean other than like maybe having a podcast or something like that,</v>

4708
01:39:19.801 --> 01:39:20.191
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

4709
01:39:20.191 --> 01:39:21.900
<v Speaker 1>and I know that Tyron does that now.</v>

4710
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Tyron Woodley has his own podcast and I think a couple of other guys may be as</v>

4711
01:39:25.441 --> 01:39:25.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4712
01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:27.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard.</v>

4713
01:39:27.330 --> 01:39:29.220
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for people to get to know you.</v>

4714
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:31.370
<v Speaker 1>All they see is this stoic fireman.</v>

4715
01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:32.850
<v Speaker 1>He goes out there and fucks people up.</v>

4716
01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:33.893
<v Speaker 1>You know they're not,</v>

4717
01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:34.860
<v Speaker 1>which should be enough.</v>

4718
01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Who doesn't want that?</v>

4719
01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.433
<v Speaker 1>That's what I say.</v>

4720
01:39:37.710 --> 01:39:38.543
<v Speaker 1>I should be enough.</v>

4721
01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:39.533
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

4722
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:40.620
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

4723
01:39:40.650 --> 01:39:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hard for the UFC to figure out how to promote everybody.</v>

4724
01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:43.621
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4725
01:39:43.621 --> 01:39:43.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4726
01:39:43.741 --> 01:39:44.070
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

4727
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's fiber people on the roster and all that,</v>

4728
01:39:47.251 --> 01:39:48.031
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

4729
01:39:48.031 --> 01:39:48.451
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

4730
01:39:48.451 --> 01:39:49.284
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4731
01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:50.483
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4732
01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:51.421
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

4733
01:39:51.421 --> 01:39:54.220
<v Speaker 1>what it is or we need to do while he made everyone happy weight.</v>

4734
01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I think the embeddeds helped me out a little bit.</v>

4735
01:39:55.950 --> 01:39:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4736
01:39:56.670 --> 01:39:57.161
<v Speaker 1>I think better.</v>

4737
01:39:57.161 --> 01:39:57.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a great,</v>

4738
01:39:57.690 --> 01:39:58.250
<v Speaker 1>I think those out.</v>

4739
01:39:58.250 --> 01:39:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4740
01:39:58.860 --> 01:39:59.790
<v Speaker 1>They help you out a lot.</v>

4741
01:39:59.810 --> 01:40:00.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4742
01:40:00.061 --> 01:40:00.880

4744
01:40:01.410 --> 01:40:01.830
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>

4747
01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:08.333
<v Speaker 1>Both might be true,</v>

4748
01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.340
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing wrong with the,</v>

4749
01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:13.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4750
01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:13.411
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

4751
01:40:13.411 --> 01:40:14.490

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Back in the day.</v>

4757
01:40:18.330 --> 01:40:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Back in the day when I lost the street right there,</v>

4758
01:40:20.491 --> 01:40:21.121
<v Speaker 1>like I was like,</v>

4759
01:40:21.121 --> 01:40:23.550
<v Speaker 1>people would write me like not want to tell how bad a person I was.</v>

4760
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:24.440
<v Speaker 1>I should kill myself.</v>

4761
01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:26.600
<v Speaker 1>That was the worst fighter America and I was in the world.</v>

4762
01:40:26.610 --> 01:40:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4763
01:40:26.850 --> 01:40:27.683
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

4764
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:28.833
<v Speaker 1>Well God,</v>

4765
01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:29.461
<v Speaker 1>and the wife's like,</v>

4766
01:40:29.461 --> 01:40:30.121
<v Speaker 1>stop reading it.</v>

4767
01:40:30.121 --> 01:40:32.370
<v Speaker 1>So I deleted my Facebook account,</v>

4768
01:40:32.371 --> 01:40:32.941
<v Speaker 1>my personal,</v>

4769
01:40:32.941 --> 01:40:33.131
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4770
01:40:33.131 --> 01:40:33.811
<v Speaker 1>I deleted it.</v>

4771
01:40:33.811 --> 01:40:34.130
<v Speaker 1>I want it.</v>

4772
01:40:34.130 --> 01:40:34.910
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

4773
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:36.390
<v Speaker 1>then I came my epiphany.</v>

4774
01:40:36.391 --> 01:40:36.631
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

4775
01:40:36.631 --> 01:40:37.141
<v Speaker 1>I'm screwed.</v>

4776

5014
01:45:34.641 --> 01:45:36.410

5015
01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:39.180

5022
01:45:43.611 --> 01:45:43.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5024
01:45:46.101 --> 01:45:46.850
<v Speaker 1>Or just know,</v>

5025
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:48.620
<v Speaker 1>take half a day and then work out at night.</v>

5026
01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.270
<v Speaker 1>And when you do take a day off,</v>

5027
01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:53.810
<v Speaker 1>do you do like ice baths or like how do you,</v>

5028
01:45:53.811 --> 01:45:54.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5029
01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:56.150
<v Speaker 1>try to accelerate the recovery?</v>

5030
01:45:56.570 --> 01:45:57.381
<v Speaker 1>Like ice bath,</v>

5031
01:45:57.381 --> 01:45:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Epsom salt or something?</v>

5032
01:45:58.491 --> 01:45:58.770
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

5033
01:45:58.770 --> 01:46:00.410
<v Speaker 1>I actually do know that I sleep all day.</v>

5034
01:46:00.411 --> 01:46:01.880
<v Speaker 1>I literally just eat and sleep all day.</v>

5035
01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:02.871
<v Speaker 1>Just sleep.</v>

5036
01:46:02.871 --> 01:46:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Just catch up my rest.</v>

5037
01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:04.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5038
01:46:04.281 --> 01:46:04.641
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

5039
01:46:04.641 --> 01:46:08.180
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting though because there's no real set thing where you can know</v>

5040
01:46:08.181 --> 01:46:09.410
<v Speaker 1>when to do it and when not to.</v>

5041
01:46:09.411 --> 01:46:10.670
<v Speaker 1>He's got to do it all by feel.</v>

5042
01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5043
01:46:11.150 --> 01:46:11.391
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

5044
01:46:11.391 --> 01:46:12.350
<v Speaker 1>I think just knowing your body,</v>

5045
01:46:12.351 --> 01:46:13.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one thing I buy,</v>

5046
01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I picked up while on since I've started finding and just knowing my body,</v>

5047
01:46:17.150 --> 01:46:17.541
<v Speaker 1>cause you know,</v>

5048
01:46:17.541 --> 01:46:18.374
<v Speaker 1>I think God,</v>

5049
01:46:18.650 --> 01:46:20.250
<v Speaker 1>you're the best critic on your body.</v>

5050
01:46:20.270 --> 01:46:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Cause like back in the day we was do cave and training,</v>

5051
01:46:22.491 --> 01:46:23.410
<v Speaker 1>you know like I feel fine,</v>

5052
01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:24.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5053
01:46:24.530 --> 01:46:25.880
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing too is like,</v>

5054
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:29.090
<v Speaker 1>we're so used to training a certain way you can get through those workouts even</v>

5055
01:46:29.091 --> 01:46:29.960
<v Speaker 1>if you're tired and sore.</v>

5056
01:46:30.290 --> 01:46:33.080
<v Speaker 1>But I can go and pick up a bag of groceries and blow up my back.</v>

5057
01:46:33.170 --> 01:46:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

5058
01:46:33.650 --> 01:46:34.200
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5059
01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:36.140
<v Speaker 1>You pick up a baby or put to put on my shit.</v>

5060
01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:36.741
<v Speaker 1>Like I never have it.</v>

5061
01:46:36.741 --> 01:46:37.230
<v Speaker 1>But it just,</v>

5062
01:46:37.230 --> 01:46:38.870
<v Speaker 1>you do random stuff that you don't do every day.</v>

5063
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:39.820

5218
01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:23.230
<v Speaker 1>these super tight things and I sit myself up and I,</v>

5219
01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:25.550
<v Speaker 1>and he can go like half your body weight,</v>

5220
01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:26.730
<v Speaker 1>6% of the body weight,</v>

5221
01:50:26.770 --> 01:50:28.060
<v Speaker 1>whatever in the water.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bad.</v>

5226
01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:33.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5227
01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5228
01:50:33.850 --> 01:50:34.960
<v Speaker 1>what's the benefit of that?</v>

5229
01:50:35.170 --> 01:50:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Just a sit on Paul.</v>

01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:38.620
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

5233
01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:39.281
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

5234
01:50:39.281 --> 01:50:42.790
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't pound your feet like so cause I'm 240 pounds so I'm going to kill</v>

5235
01:50:42.791 --> 01:50:44.940
<v Speaker 1>my feet and my legs and my knees so it lets me out.</v>

5236
01:50:44.941 --> 01:50:45.820
<v Speaker 1>It makes a little bit easier.</v>

5237
01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:46.660
<v Speaker 1>But does it,</v>

5238

5241
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:51.881
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5242
01:50:51.881 --> 01:50:55.180
<v Speaker 1>But you're running at 9.5 miles per hour at less than your body weight.</v>

5243
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

01:52:00.601 --> 01:52:01.610
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it in this thing.</v>

5295
01:52:01.611 --> 01:52:02.740
<v Speaker 1>You're not running on the concrete.</v>

5296
01:52:03.370 --> 01:52:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I like running.</v>

5298
01:52:04.751 --> 01:52:05.321
<v Speaker 1>I think it just,</v>

01:52:05.321 --> 01:52:05.981
<v Speaker 1>it feels so much better.</v>

<v Speaker 1>My legs like I feel a hundred times better.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5302
01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:09.011
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine.</v>

5303
01:52:09.011 --> 01:52:09.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean especially when you're,</v>

5304
01:52:10.270 --> 01:52:10.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5305
01:52:10.571 --> 01:52:14.410
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with 240 pounds pounding on your knees and you've scoped out all</v>

5306
01:52:14.411 --> 01:52:15.310
<v Speaker 1>the cartilage and shit.</v>

5307
01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:17.410
<v Speaker 1>They're doing some stuff now though.</v>

5308
01:52:17.411 --> 01:52:20.080
<v Speaker 1>You should look into like talk to Dr. Davidson from the UFC.</v>

5309
01:52:20.081 --> 01:52:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5310
01:52:20.570 --> 01:52:24.340
<v Speaker 1>The shooting stem cells and to knees and regenerating cartilage and meniscus</v>

5311
01:52:24.341 --> 01:52:26.740
<v Speaker 1>tissue and you're getting into that for sure.</v>

5312
01:52:26.741 --> 01:52:29.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean I definitely want to get knee replacement with when I'm older.</v>

5313
01:52:29.141 --> 01:52:31.810
<v Speaker 1>So new replacement where I don't want to have that.</v>

5314
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:32.161
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

5315
01:52:32.161 --> 01:52:32.371
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5316
01:52:32.371 --> 01:52:32.930

5320
01:52:36.281 --> 01:52:37.690
<v Speaker 1>I think soft tissue stuff,</v>

5321
01:52:37.691 --> 01:52:38.950
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be able to fix that.</v>

5350
01:53:13.130 --> 01:53:14.360
<v Speaker 3>our great grandchildren,</v>

5351
01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:16.640
<v Speaker 3>they're going to cut their hands off and grow new ones that they don't think</v>

5352
01:53:16.641 --> 01:53:17.200
<v Speaker 3>they look good.</v>

5353
01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:17.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5354
01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:18.950
<v Speaker 3>Kids going to be like my hands,</v>

5355
01:53:18.951 --> 01:53:19.671
<v Speaker 3>like to ugly.</v>

5356
01:53:19.671 --> 01:53:20.271
<v Speaker 3>I wanted long,</v>

5357
01:53:20.271 --> 01:53:21.104
<v Speaker 3>slender finger.</v>

5358
01:53:21.110 --> 01:53:22.990
<v Speaker 3>So I caught them off like that.</v>

5359
01:53:24.650 --> 01:53:25.940
<v Speaker 3>That's the world we're going to be living in.</v>

5360
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5361
01:53:26.690 --> 01:53:28.130
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be superficial.</v>

5362
01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:28.611
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5363
01:53:28.611 --> 01:53:29.450
<v Speaker 3>not just superficial,</v>

5364
01:53:29.451 --> 01:53:30.260
<v Speaker 3>but bizarre.</v>

5365
01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:31.240
<v Speaker 3>Like you're gonna be able to re,</v>

5366
01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:31.581
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5367
01:53:31.581 --> 01:53:33.830
<v Speaker 3>they've already regenerated a bunch of different body parts.</v>

5368
01:53:33.831 --> 01:53:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Like this one woman had bladder cancer and so they made her a new bladder with</v>

5369
01:53:38.121 --> 01:53:38.960
<v Speaker 3>her own skin.</v>

5370
01:53:38.961 --> 01:53:43.961
<v Speaker 3>They used her own skin and I'm used stem cells and grew her bladder in a petri</v>

5371
01:53:44.271 --> 01:53:46.850
<v Speaker 3>dish and then put it back in her body.</v>

5372
01:53:48.170 --> 01:53:48.441
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

5373
01:53:48.441 --> 01:53:49.640
<v Speaker 3>Works Great.</v>

5374
01:53:49.641 --> 01:53:49.821
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

5375
01:53:49.821 --> 01:53:50.930
<v Speaker 3>I haven't talked to her about her pee.</v>

5376
01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:53.210
<v Speaker 3>The promise of growing new teeth,</v>

5377
01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:57.980
<v Speaker 3>dental stem cells could revolutionize treatment for patients who face</v>

5378
01:53:57.981 --> 01:53:58.880
<v Speaker 3>extractions.</v>

5379
01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:00.253
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

5380
01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Growing new teeth.</v>

5381
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:03.740
<v Speaker 3>Fuck what a weird world we're living in.</v>

5382
01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:04.633
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5383
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:06.350
<v Speaker 3>That's got to feel good for you though.</v>

5384
01:54:06.351 --> 01:54:07.730
<v Speaker 3>It'd be thinking about the future,</v>

5385
01:54:07.731 --> 01:54:09.470
<v Speaker 3>like all the stuff you're doing yourself right now,</v>

5386
01:54:09.590 --> 01:54:12.020
<v Speaker 3>all the injuries and getting banged up,</v>

5387
01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:14.420
<v Speaker 3>squirt some stuff in there and fix everything.</v>

5388
01:54:14.450 --> 01:54:15.283
<v Speaker 3>I'm cool with that.</v>

5389
01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:16.723
<v Speaker 3>I'm good with that.</v>

5390
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:17.300
