00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.550
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.090
<v Speaker 1>And we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello Denis.</v>

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Hi Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great to see you.</v>

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Great to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As always.</v>

6
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>It's great to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me about this,</v>

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>these cards that you gave me and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all about.</v>

8
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 1>this is an interesting project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is about the RV hereclitis,</v>

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.200
<v Speaker 1>which was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was associated with the Institute </v>

11
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>for Ecotechnics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is try to keep this close to your </v>

12
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>

14
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with,</v>

15
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I explain it?</v>

16
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 1>It was actually a theater company called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theater of all possibilities,</v>

17
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>but the institute for Ecotechnics was </v>
<v Speaker 1>started in the early seventies.</v>

18
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 1>They built the ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

19
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:52.130
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Chinese junk essentially with a feral </v>
<v Speaker 1>concrete hall.</v>

21
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>And my connection was they have Cruz </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cruz,</v>

22
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:05.901
<v Speaker 1>the world essentially since 1973 looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>into different things relevant to global</v>

23
00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:12.111
<v Speaker 1>ecology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've done sampling in the Antarctic </v>

24
00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:12.111
<v Speaker 1>can in 1981.</v>

25
00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:16.730
<v Speaker 1>They decided to go to the Amazon and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing my graduate work in Ketosis at</v>

26
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:22.041
<v Speaker 1>that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was my connection with the </v>

27
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Institute of Ecotechnics and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 1>at the time I thought these people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuts.</v>

29
00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:33.771
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were kind of nuts and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were very naive about what they were </v>

30
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>doing as far as doing ethno botanical </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

31
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Not that I wasn't naive about it at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

32
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:42.390
<v Speaker 1>but I had a better handle on it than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do anyway.</v>

33
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:47.391
<v Speaker 1>That was the original connection and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same group years after I had more or </v>

34
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:50.830
<v Speaker 1>less a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.910
<v Speaker 1>kind of severed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really sever my relationship </v>

36
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.910
<v Speaker 1>but I kind of distanced myself from </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

37
00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.080
<v Speaker 1>But then that same group went on in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties to build biosphere two,</v>

38
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>which you probably heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had financing for biosphere two.</v>

39
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:10.670
<v Speaker 1>So they've gone to a whole other level </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ambition and,</v>

40
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>and madness.</v>

41
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.180
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and biosphere two went off traveling </v>

42
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 1>that to people who don't know what we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

43
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:23.121
<v Speaker 1>Biosphere two was the idea of building a</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrestrial environment that was </v>

44
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:27.700
<v Speaker 1>completely shut off from everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was self sustaining.</v>

45
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>And it was a huge complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a big series of domes really.</v>

46
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Each dome replicated some earthly bio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the desert,</v>

47
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>the rain forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ocean,</v>

48
00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:43.170
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea was that,</v>

49
00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:44.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

50
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>it was a dry run for building a Mars </v>
<v Speaker 1>colony,</v>

51
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some planetary colony.</v>

52
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:56.841
<v Speaker 1>And the idea was Mars and they put </v>
<v Speaker 1>people into this environment for like </v>

53
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>two years at a</v>

54
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.790
<v Speaker 2>to see if they could make it work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they could really have a balanced </v>

55
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 2>ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

56
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 2>as it turned out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't work so well,</v>

57
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.680
<v Speaker 2>but they learned a great deal from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they also got a lot of adverse </v>

58
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.970
<v Speaker 2>publicity because I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

59
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.980
<v Speaker 2>I think the science establishment in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way became kind of jealous and you know,</v>

60
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:26.131
<v Speaker 2>like these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know anything about what </v>

61
00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:26.131
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got $600,</v>

62
00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 2>million dollars to build this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the hell?</v>

63
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 2>So I got a lot of criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact is a lot of good science </v>

64
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 2>came out of this and they're still </v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

65
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.560
<v Speaker 2>And the interesting thing is they've had</v>
<v Speaker 2>their fingers in many pies.</v>

66
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a gallery in a hotel in London</v>

67
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 2>called the opto October gallery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always stay there,</v>

68
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 2>a fund in London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a publishing company,</v>

69
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 2>the synergetic press based in Santa Fe.</v>

70
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 2>That's who published this book </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately.</v>

71
00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:02.131
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of like 30 years later what</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes around comes around in the book is </v>

72
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Ethno pharmacologic search for </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoactive drugs and it's from.</v>

73
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 2>It's labeled from 1967 to 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

74
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 2>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the story behind this is,</v>

75
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm just too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just to complete the hereclitis </v>

76
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.201
<v Speaker 2>story a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the hereclitis has been plying the </v>

77
00:04:25.201 --> 00:04:28.471
<v Speaker 2>ocean more or less continuously since </v>
<v Speaker 2>1973 and they are now renovated the ship</v>

78
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 2>because you know it needs it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it needs a new hole and all that.</v>

79
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:37.720
<v Speaker 2>So they're trying to raise funds </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously for that.</v>

80
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.110
<v Speaker 2>But it's just a very interesting story </v>
<v Speaker 2>about people that are passionate about </v>

81
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.460
<v Speaker 2>the ecology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the earth and about science.</v>

82
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.940
<v Speaker 2>Don't know a whole lot about any of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their passion drove them forward and</v>

83
00:04:54.981 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 2>and their passion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Particularly the founder,</v>

84
00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:01.650
<v Speaker 2>a guy named John Allen who's now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's in his eight.</v>

85
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.680
<v Speaker 2>He isn't his eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was the visionary behind it.</v>

86
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 2>And without knowing a whole lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just went ahead and did it,</v>

87
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in that spirit,</v>

88
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 2>you have to hand it to them and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

89
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 2>they've done incredible things over that</v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time.</v>

90
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.580
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great story and it's worth the </v>

91
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 2>attention and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's up to you.</v>

92
00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:25.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's of,</v>

93
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.140
<v Speaker 2>it's up to you if you want to bring her </v>
<v Speaker 2>on or somebody.</v>

94
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

95
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 2>it sounds fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really romantic,</v>

96
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this escience in,</v>

97
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.090
<v Speaker 2>in the true spirit of discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

98
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.690
<v Speaker 2>and what are they done by amateurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

99
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 2>It isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is fascinating.</v>

100
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.460
<v Speaker 2>Were they trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're kind of research at her that </v>

101
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.460
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to do in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All kinds of things.</v>

102
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.390
<v Speaker 2>They've been sampling coral reefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd been sampling,</v>

103
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at,</v>

104
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:51.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

105
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>global warming in both the Arctic and </v>

106
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.960
<v Speaker 2>the Antarctic.</v>

107
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they of in [inaudible] 81,</v>

108
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to do ethnobotany and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon and,</v>

109
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.460
<v Speaker 2>and they had shelties on their board of </v>
<v Speaker 2>directors and the director of the </v>

110
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.631
<v Speaker 2>expedition was Wade Davis and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was doing my graduate work at that</v>

111
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:15.821
<v Speaker 2>time and we knew they were coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as a result of that I was able to </v>

112
00:06:15.821 --> 00:06:20.740
<v Speaker 2>join the expedition and we deny at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time he was selected by them as the </v>

113
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.390
<v Speaker 2>chief science officer and when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time I got there he was getting a</v>

114
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 2>little disillusioned with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

116
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could say the personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamic was kind of strange.</v>

117
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 2>And like if you read my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Brotherhood of the screaming abyss,</v>

118
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:41.870
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a chapter on this,</v>

119
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.100
<v Speaker 2>but over time even weighed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed his mind and,</v>

120
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now get the larger picture of what </v>

121
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to do.</v>

122
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

123
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a real story.</v>

124
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:57.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people didn't recognize </v>

125
00:06:57.941 --> 00:06:57.941
<v Speaker 2>boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

126
00:06:57.941 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were theater people,</v>

127
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.040
<v Speaker 2>they actually understood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I didn't at the time that what </v>

128
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 2>they were doing and their whole effort </v>
<v Speaker 2>was really a performance,</v>

129
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a global level.</v>

130
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:16.271
<v Speaker 2>They did all these things kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing that this was the theater of </v>

131
00:07:16.271 --> 00:07:19.460
<v Speaker 2>all possibilities and they had a theater</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Austin,</v>

132
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Texas by that name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I could.</v>

133
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 2>It's a wild story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like a freaky crew.</v>

134
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a freaky crew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the point.</v>

135
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the people that were on that </v>

136
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.550
<v Speaker 2>1981 expedition or now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

137
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:37.760
<v Speaker 2>they're still associated with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it has some longevity.</v>

138
00:07:37.761 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Others have passed on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>others have left in disgust or,</v>

139
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:44.030
<v Speaker 2>or they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have enough.</v>

140
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.470
<v Speaker 2>But I was able to reconnect with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that run,</v>

141
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:53.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this ranch in Santa fe called </v>

142
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:53.590
<v Speaker 2>the Synergia ranch.</v>

143
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.180
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that's based there</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this press,</v>

144
00:07:56.181 --> 00:08:01.181
<v Speaker 2>the synergetic press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I was doing this project with </v>

145
00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:04.730
<v Speaker 2>the book I was casting around for who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to publish this after we do it,</v>

146
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 2>and they stepped up and they publish a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of psychedelic stuff.</v>

147
00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 2>They have a book called the mystic </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemist about Albert Hoffman.</v>

148
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.070
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they republishes,</v>

149
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the IOWASCA reader,</v>

150
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:17.810
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

151
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.320
<v Speaker 2>originally Eduardo Luna and Steven </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dwight had published.</v>

152
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:26.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they expanded that and they published </v>

153
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.710
<v Speaker 2>status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very beautiful,</v>

154
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Redo,</v>

155
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 2>essentially a second edition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very nice work.</v>

156
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm Don Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

157
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:39.320
<v Speaker 2>who's not that well known,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's written several books about the</v>

158
00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:42.020
<v Speaker 2>history of psychedelics and the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

159
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 2>And he wrote a book that they published </v>
<v Speaker 2>called changing our minds.</v>

160
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the same time,</v>

161
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:54.071
<v Speaker 2>Michael Pollan brought his book out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Michael Pollan been who he is,</v>

162
00:08:54.471 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 2>got all the attention.</v>

163
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Dawn's got very little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still a good book,</v>

164
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're good people.</v>

165
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 2>I've decided that some of my initial </v>
<v Speaker 2>judgments,</v>

166
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:11.061
<v Speaker 2>not knowing the people and when I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of walked into their reality in a </v>

167
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:15.010
<v Speaker 2>ketose when I got there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 2>which they never bothered to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to explain.</v>

169
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

170
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:19.500
<v Speaker 2>they never said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

171
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:20.150
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

172
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.520
<v Speaker 2>we're acting funny because we do things </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently than you do,</v>

173
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

174
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:26.400
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

175
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they evolve to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about they have,</v>

176
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:35.060
<v Speaker 2>they have evolved and they learn a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>through this biosphere two a,</v>

177
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>project which was a real lesson to </v>

178
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:40.720
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

179
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.360
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so because they still existed and really</v>

180
00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:50.361
<v Speaker 2>because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the resurrection of the Iowasca </v>

181
00:09:50.361 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 2>reader that had been my recent contact </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

182
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:57.531
<v Speaker 2>So when I decided to do this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought they were a good candidate to </v>

183
00:09:57.531 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 2>publish this book.</v>

184
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.810
<v Speaker 2>And they totally got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took it on.</v>

185
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.370
<v Speaker 2>They've done an amazing job and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>book or these,</v>

186
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.960
<v Speaker 2>this set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

187
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:12.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the genesis of it because you had a lot </v>

188
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:13.710
<v Speaker 2>to do with it when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was here last year,</v>

189
00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:15.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

190
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the backstory is in 1967,</v>

191
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.720
<v Speaker 2>the US government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the National Institute of Mental Health </v>

192
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.620
<v Speaker 2>of all people put together a conference </v>
<v Speaker 2>in San Francisco in 67 called the f no </v>

193
00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:31.410
<v Speaker 2>pharmacologic search for psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

194
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.720
<v Speaker 2>And nobody noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a private conference.</v>

195
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:41.730
<v Speaker 2>It was not open to the public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that public ever got out </v>

196
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.150
<v Speaker 2>of it was the symposium proceedings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the first book there.</v>

197
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:50.240
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very heavily influenced by that </v>

198
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.050
<v Speaker 2>book because somehow or other it came </v>
<v Speaker 2>into my hands at age 17,</v>

199
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bored teenager living in peo onion,</v>

200
00:10:58.801 --> 00:11:03.801
<v Speaker 2>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wishing that I was with my brother in </v>

201
00:11:03.801 --> 00:11:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Berkeley where all the action was at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

202
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.420
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this book,</v>

203
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.640
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I totally,</v>

204
00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:13.050
<v Speaker 2>I devoured it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And about the same time I discovered the</v>

205
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:18.051
<v Speaker 2>teachings of Don Juan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which my brother gave to me for my 18th </v>

206
00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:22.550
<v Speaker 2>birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And although much in there is probably </v>

207
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.690
<v Speaker 2>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those two books gave me a complimentary </v>

208
00:11:27.091 --> 00:11:32.091
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The teachings of Don Juan was the </v>

209
00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:36.021
<v Speaker 2>ethnographic lens through which you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could use look at the use of </v>

210
00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:40.701
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and which I kind of filled in those </v>

211
00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:44.661
<v Speaker 2>spaces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then this book came out and it was like </v>

212
00:11:44.661 --> 00:11:45.300
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew who she was.</v>

213
00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:47.790
<v Speaker 2>I knew who a few of these people were at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

214
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:52.791
<v Speaker 2>shelties and Shogun and Andrew while </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're actually on the original faculty.</v>

215
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.680
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when the book fell into my hands at </v>

216
00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.341
<v Speaker 2>age 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very excited and I read the whole </v>

217
00:12:02.341 --> 00:12:02.341
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

218
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.620
<v Speaker 2>and this is what really helped me focus </v>
<v Speaker 2>my career.</v>

219
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.620
<v Speaker 2>It made me aware that maybe I could make</v>
<v Speaker 2>a career out of ethno pharmacology,</v>

220
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:11.970
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

221
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.670
<v Speaker 2>and in my very naive 17 year old teenage</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

222
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow man,</v>

223
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:21.900
<v Speaker 2>I can get paid to get stone was in part </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

224
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.620
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

225
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:24.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was more to it.</v>

226
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:28.570
<v Speaker 2>But that's what led me to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pursue that career.</v>

227
00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:33.571
<v Speaker 2>And so this book has always loomed large</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my sort of Pantheon.</v>

228
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Originally there was supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>followup conferences for this,</v>

229
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.420
<v Speaker 2>for the government to have every 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

230
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the war on drugs,</v>

231
00:12:42.341 --> 00:12:43.600
<v Speaker 2>scotched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

232
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.720
<v Speaker 2>They became embarrassed that they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything to do with a conference like </v>

233
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.530
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the goal of the conference?</v>

234
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:54.120
<v Speaker 2>Is that clear of the original </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference?</v>

235
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

239

<v Speaker 2>So the first book was really where </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like the snuffs and I was and uh,</v>

241
00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:17.881

<v Speaker 2>really a psychedelics like Kava and </v>

242
00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:20.350
<v Speaker 2>nominated miscarrying all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're saying the snaps,</v>

243
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.530

<v Speaker 2>psychedelics psychedelics?</v>

<v Speaker 2>active form that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>for Rola and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and them Thera,</v>

247
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.010
<v Speaker 2>which is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

248
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:33.790
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

249
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.560
<v Speaker 2>what are they called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yotpo?</v>

250
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.620
<v Speaker 2>I think there was some easily they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stuff them up their nose.</v>

251
00:13:41.371 --> 00:13:43.570
<v Speaker 2>Is that the dental or that's the deal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

252
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the first book.</v>

253
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.480
<v Speaker 2>The 67 book was the first one where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

254
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.930
<v Speaker 2>there was a collection of the leading </v>
<v Speaker 2>experts of the time,</v>

255
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.260
<v Speaker 2>most of whom you've never heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there were,</v>

256
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.830
<v Speaker 2>there were iconic people like shelties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Weil,</v>

257
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Sheboygan.</v>

258
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Another interesting fellow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

259
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:08.290
<v Speaker 2>many interesting people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most interesting in the first</v>

260
00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:12.080
<v Speaker 2>conference was a gentleman named Steven </v>
<v Speaker 2>Zahra,</v>

261
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.720
<v Speaker 2>a Hungarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a chemist and psychiatrist and </v>

262
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:22.051
<v Speaker 2>pharmacologist and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he originally worked in Budapest and uh,</v>

263
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:30.750
<v Speaker 2>and eventually he moved to the states </v>
<v Speaker 2>and became pretty high up in the </v>

264
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:35.580
<v Speaker 2>National Institutes of health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the director of the National </v>

265
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Institute on Drug Abuse in the late </v>
<v Speaker 2>fifties.</v>

266
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.090
<v Speaker 2>But the interesting thing is before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

267
00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was just a researcher in,</v>

268
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.580
<v Speaker 2>at a hospital in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Budapest,</v>

269
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:50.610
<v Speaker 2>he applied to Santos to get lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to do research with LSD.</v>

270
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.640
<v Speaker 2>They refuse to give it to him because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was behind the iron curtain.</v>

271
00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.240
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he synthesize dmt being a chemist and</v>

272
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.420
<v Speaker 2>he had to determine if it was actually a</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic.</v>

273
00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:10.310
<v Speaker 2>So it when the grand tradition he did </v>
<v Speaker 2>that by self injecting himself,</v>

274
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's a true pioneer and I invited him</v>

275
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:15.950
<v Speaker 2>to the conference.</v>

276
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 2>So he's the first person to definitively</v>
<v Speaker 2>show that the emt was a psychedelic.</v>

277
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.130
<v Speaker 2>He's now 95.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in great shape.</v>

278
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.370
<v Speaker 2>I invited him to the conference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said,</v>

279
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:29.480
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 95,</v>

280
00:15:29.481 --> 00:15:34.481
<v Speaker 2>I don't go anywhere anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he submitted a very nice video </v>

281
00:15:34.481 --> 00:15:39.461
<v Speaker 2>introduction to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other interesting thing that he </v>

282
00:15:39.461 --> 00:15:41.300
<v Speaker 2>did after the 67 conference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

283
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.650
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was thinking,</v>

284
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:44.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on and will,</v>

285
00:15:44.231 --> 00:15:47.010
<v Speaker 2>what is it with the hippies and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics.</v>

286
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.490
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

287
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.600
<v Speaker 2>so his supervisor said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well Steve,</v>

288
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.900
<v Speaker 2>why don't you go over to Haight Ashbury </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hang out for awhile?</v>

289
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:59.170
<v Speaker 2>So he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he submitted a paper called the </v>

290
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.741
<v Speaker 2>scientist among the hippies and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't let him publish.</v>

291
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.030
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't publish this.</v>

292
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.940
<v Speaker 2>So it sat in his drawer for 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When this book came along,</v>

293
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.150
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have something.</v>

294
00:16:11.151 --> 00:16:13.100
<v Speaker 2>I'll submit here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if they,</v>

295
00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

296
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.740
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter anymore.</v>

297
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:21.010
<v Speaker 2>So one of the papers in this second </v>
<v Speaker 2>volume is his original 67 paper.</v>

298
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

299
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.360
<v Speaker 2>so the second volume is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

300
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.540
<v Speaker 2>because the government didn't step up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plate,</v>

301
00:16:29.541 --> 00:16:31.690
<v Speaker 2>like they said they would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

302
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.000
<v Speaker 2>there was no followup conferences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

303
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.630
<v Speaker 2>and I've for a long time I wanted to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>a followup conference.</v>

304
00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:40.920
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do it on the 30th </v>
<v Speaker 2>anniversary.</v>

305
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.900
<v Speaker 2>90 seven never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time passes.</v>

306
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:49.700
<v Speaker 2>So 2017 was the 50th anniversary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all fell together.</v>

307
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.170
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

308
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.680
<v Speaker 2>I found a venue in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a beautiful country house that was a </v>

309
00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:02.470
<v Speaker 2>called tearing him hauled that was run </v>
<v Speaker 2>by one of our friends who shares,</v>

310
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our perspective.</v>

311
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.220
<v Speaker 2>He made that available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We put the word out,</v>

312
00:17:07.221 --> 00:17:10.580
<v Speaker 2>we got support to produce the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference.</v>

313
00:17:10.581 --> 00:17:14.720
<v Speaker 2>So we brought about 16 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

314
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to tearing ham and the England and spent</v>

315
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.220
<v Speaker 2>three days presenting.</v>

316
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.720
<v Speaker 2>And those videos are all up on the web.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll send you the link.</v>

317
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:28.750
<v Speaker 2>That's open access.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that we couldn't do at </v>

318
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.661
<v Speaker 2>67 that we did in 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no facebook live streaming </v>

319
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:37.540
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All our videos were facebook live </v>

320
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:37.910
<v Speaker 2>straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had 60,000</v>

321
00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:40.640
<v Speaker 2>people watching these lectures at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>points,</v>

322
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

323
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.750
<v Speaker 2>so that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

324
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:49.780
<v Speaker 2>And that created excitement and then we </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically paid for the book by </v>

325
00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:54.740
<v Speaker 2>preselling Greece selling that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people stepped up and </v>

326
00:17:55.351 --> 00:18:00.351
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people were very patient </v>

327
00:18:00.351 --> 00:18:00.351
<v Speaker 2>because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

328
00:18:00.351 --> 00:18:01.320
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

329
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.150
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this will be out by Christmas,</v>

330
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:03.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

331
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.580
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big project.</v>

332
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.090
<v Speaker 2>So it took six months longer than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>

333
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now it's out there and uh,</v>

334
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:17.010
<v Speaker 2>hopefully it'll be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a landmark in the field,</v>

335
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:18.150
<v Speaker 2>like the first one was.</v>

336
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:23.150
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what we wanted to do to honor the </v>

337
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.400
<v Speaker 2>first one was reprint the first one </v>
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>

338
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.620
<v Speaker 2>So that's why it's two books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did a high resolution,</v>

339
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:33.650
<v Speaker 2>a scam of the original book and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reprinted that one.</v>

340
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:39.110
<v Speaker 2>And then make you think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if Nixon wasn't president back </v>

341
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.210
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What could have been done?</v>

342
00:18:39.211 --> 00:18:44.211
<v Speaker 2>Like what if they didn't have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sweeping 1970 psychedelic act where they</v>

343
00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:51.561
<v Speaker 2>made everything illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what if they continued with this </v>

344
00:18:51.561 --> 00:18:51.561
<v Speaker 2>stuff and who knows where we'd be today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

345
00:18:51.561 --> 00:18:56.230
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could ask that question about a lot </v>

346
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.230
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if that didn't happen?</v>

347
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Like the psychedelic research that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening now,</v>

348
00:18:59.281 --> 00:19:03.000
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's taken 40 years to get back to it.</v>

349
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:06.780
<v Speaker 2>And basically the psychedelic research </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

350
00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:10.260
<v Speaker 2>is a lot of the same thing was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

351
00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:14.070
<v Speaker 2>going on back in the even late fifties </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sixties.</v>

352
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.190
<v Speaker 2>What's going on now is they're repeating</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that,</v>

353
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.660
<v Speaker 2>but with more rigorous experimental </v>
<v Speaker 2>design with,</v>

354
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.530
<v Speaker 2>with better controls and all that.</v>

355
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.020
<v Speaker 2>But it's the same stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

356
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.490
<v Speaker 2>which is wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

357
00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for it.</v>

358
00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see this work done.</v>

359
00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:35.091
<v Speaker 2>I also have plenty to say about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitations of that strictly clinical,</v>

360
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

361
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:41.160
<v Speaker 2>a sort of medical approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

362
00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:43.640
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

363
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.580
<v Speaker 2>organizations like maps and hefter half </v>
<v Speaker 2>to work within the constraints of what's</v>

364
00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:54.010
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think in some ways they,</v>

365
00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:59.610
<v Speaker 2>they force themselves to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're forced to put on blinders in a </v>

366
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:03.360
<v Speaker 2>certain way to what else is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

367
00:20:03.361 --> 00:20:08.361
<v Speaker 2>the way that a Iowasca has been sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>marginalized and there is research going</v>

368
00:20:10.381 --> 00:20:15.381
<v Speaker 2>on about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing approved in the </v>

369
00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:15.540
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

370
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.600
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's important to pursue </v>
<v Speaker 2>that work,</v>

371
00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:23.601
<v Speaker 2>but because you can't synthesize Iowasca</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can silicide bonaire Mtma or </v>

372
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.280
<v Speaker 2>these things that under clinical trials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much more difficult to study within</v>

373
00:20:29.281 --> 00:20:33.540
<v Speaker 2>the constraints of a phase one clinical </v>
<v Speaker 2>trial.</v>

374
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:39.020
<v Speaker 2>But in fact Iowasca is touching and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think far more lives than say,</v>

375
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say about mushrooms because </v>

376
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.050
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms are a lot out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

377
00:20:46.051 --> 00:20:51.051
<v Speaker 2>the potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the impact that it's having on society </v>

378
00:20:51.051 --> 00:20:54.871
<v Speaker 2>is much greater because people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>rediscovering this and people are,</v>

379
00:20:55.151 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 2>I think reaching out for.</v>

380
00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:02.350
<v Speaker 2>They're reaching out for anything that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will work.</v>

381
00:21:02.351 --> 00:21:03.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a society,</v>

382
00:21:03.701 --> 00:21:08.701
<v Speaker 2>we are spiritually bereft and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a pervasive sense of despair and</v>

383
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.870
<v Speaker 2>a feeling of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it,</v>

384
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:18.871
<v Speaker 2>spiritual impoverishment or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we see that all of our institutions </v>

385
00:21:19.631 --> 00:21:21.910
<v Speaker 2>are becoming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

386
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.640
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing behind the curtain,</v>

387
00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:27.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm realizing that there are empty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

388
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.970
<v Speaker 2>they don't really have anything to offer</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the spiritual level,</v>

389
00:21:30.971 --> 00:21:35.971
<v Speaker 2>especially religions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are rejecting religions as the </v>

390
00:21:35.971 --> 00:21:36.620
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

391
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Shell game that it is empty promises </v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't deliver and I think that's a </v>

392
00:21:42.011 --> 00:21:46.300
<v Speaker 2>lot of why people are reaching out for </v>
<v Speaker 2>these plant medicines,</v>

393
00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

394
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.370
<v Speaker 2>going to South America or to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iowasca or,</v>

395
00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:56.371
<v Speaker 2>or finding them in their own community </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people crave spiritually </v>

396
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:59.470
<v Speaker 2>meaningful experiences and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and our</v>

397
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.290
<v Speaker 3>cultured needs it more than effort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

398
00:22:02.291 --> 00:22:07.291
<v Speaker 3>the thing about psychedelics that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you just said is so important that </v>

399
00:22:07.291 --> 00:22:07.840
<v Speaker 3>they deliver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They deliver.</v>

400
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:12.870
<v Speaker 3>If you're skeptical about religion and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know there's some people that get a </v>

401
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:13.750
<v Speaker 3>lot out of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>

402
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Speaker 3>but if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're skeptical about it,</v>

403
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.730
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to fulfill your promises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

404
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.700
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to give you anything that</v>

405
00:22:21.701 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 3>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

406
00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:27.811
<v Speaker 3>this is irrefutable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Psychedelic experiences are pretty </v>

407
00:22:27.811 --> 00:22:29.530
<v Speaker 3>irrefutable that something's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's titanic.</v>

408
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.560
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so immense and bizarre and beyond </v>

409
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.831
<v Speaker 3>the normal that it's hard to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>dismiss it and the only people that </v>

410
00:22:37.831 --> 00:22:39.700
<v Speaker 3>really do dismiss it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that haven't experienced it.</v>

411
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.260
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

412
00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:43.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

413
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:48.390
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes say psychedelics are the </v>

414
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.390
<v Speaker 2>antidote to faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

415
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.930
<v Speaker 2>you don't need faith to take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic.</v>

416
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.910
<v Speaker 2>What you need is courage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

417
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.210
<v Speaker 2>religions offer faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically saying,</v>

418
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:02.240
<v Speaker 2>here's a list of things that you need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe without question and if that's </v>

419
00:23:03.031 --> 00:23:04.440
<v Speaker 2>your inclination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

420
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:09.060
<v Speaker 2>But most of us are more skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need something tangible,</v>

421
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:14.090
<v Speaker 2>something more tangible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think faith is a mean.</v>

422
00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.290
<v Speaker 2>That's how religions entice you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

423
00:23:19.291 --> 00:23:21.430
<v Speaker 2>But I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

424
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:26.130
<v Speaker 2>in a way it's deceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you have to believe when you can,</v>

425
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:32.300
<v Speaker 2>in that intensely personal encounter </v>
<v Speaker 2>between you and a plant teacher or you </v>

426
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:36.840
<v Speaker 2>and a plant molecule and a molecule you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can experience for yourself.</v>

427
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.400
<v Speaker 2>You don't need faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>

428
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:43.490
<v Speaker 2>I know that this exists and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the realms that it opens up for you real</v>

429
00:23:45.561 --> 00:23:47.060
<v Speaker 2>because I've experienced it.</v>

430
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

431
00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:51.160
<v Speaker 2>I think faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

432
00:23:51.161 --> 00:23:52.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we in a way,</v>

433
00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least the Abrahamic religions,</v>

434
00:23:56.811 --> 00:24:01.811
<v Speaker 2>Christianity and Judaism and Islam to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain extent have poisoned the western</v>

435
00:24:02.991 --> 00:24:04.700
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

436
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:09.730
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and encouraged our separation from </v>

437
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.791
<v Speaker 2>nature and basically propagated this </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that we're separated from nature </v>

438
00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.250
<v Speaker 2>and we own it and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have every right to dominate it.</v>

439
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.730
<v Speaker 2>And we're seeing the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

440
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to rediscover this indigenous </v>

441
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.061
<v Speaker 2>perspective that we are part of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're properly in properly frame.</v>

442
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.370
<v Speaker 2>We should be symbiotic with nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about symbiosis.</v>

443
00:24:34.371 --> 00:24:39.371
<v Speaker 2>It's all about collaborating with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>global community of species to advance </v>

444
00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:43.220
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just of our species,</v>

445
00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.370
<v Speaker 2>but of the whole community of sentience </v>
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>

446
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:51.730
<v Speaker 2>This is what the psychedelics can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think this is what the </v>

447
00:24:51.861 --> 00:24:55.640
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics are desperately reaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>out to our species.</v>

448
00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:01.570
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody who watches my podcast or </v>

449
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.230
<v Speaker 2>listens to me is this is my wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wake up you monkeys.</v>

450
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wrecking this place.</v>

451
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:10.810
<v Speaker 2>It's that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're recognized place and that's </v>

452
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.530
<v Speaker 2>because you have to really understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>your relationship to nature.</v>

453
00:25:12.531 --> 00:25:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Realize that number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you monkeys aren't running things,</v>

454
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:21.350
<v Speaker 2>the plants are running things basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're sustaining life on </v>

455
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.920
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other things are,</v>

456
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of it.</v>

457
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.530
<v Speaker 2>And then once you wake up to the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

458
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:28.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

459
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:33.650
<v Speaker 2>we're in a participatory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>collaborative role with the community of</v>

460
00:25:33.651 --> 00:25:38.651
<v Speaker 2>species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we have to change a whole lot of </v>

461
00:25:38.651 --> 00:25:41.120
<v Speaker 2>things that we're not doing right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're certainly not,</v>

462
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:45.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing sustainable ways to live on a</v>

463
00:25:45.801 --> 00:25:50.801
<v Speaker 2>global scale and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're seeing the consequences of </v>

464
00:25:50.801 --> 00:25:50.801
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

465
00:25:50.801 --> 00:25:53.570
<v Speaker 2>What's dismaying besides the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's happening,</v>

466
00:25:53.571 --> 00:25:58.571
<v Speaker 2>is that there is so much denial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much refusal to recognize this on the</v>

467
00:26:00.531 --> 00:26:04.340
<v Speaker 2>part of the people that supposedly are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are running the show,</v>

468
00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:05.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>

469
00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:08.420
<v Speaker 2>they're willfully ignorant and this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

470
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:10.520
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

471
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people will agree with </v>

472
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:20.261
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people who listen to this show </v>

473
00:26:20.261 --> 00:26:22.220
<v Speaker 2>will agree with me when I say I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much given up on politics.</v>

474
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Politics seems to me irrevocably broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many other institutions are </v>

475
00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.020
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not broken.</v>

476
00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:33.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean sciences corrupt in government is</v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt.</v>

477
00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.950
<v Speaker 2>It's corporate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the corporatism is,</v>

478
00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:42.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are all flawed systems because </v>

479
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.581
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a base of compassion and</v>

480
00:26:47.641 --> 00:26:52.641
<v Speaker 2>recognition of the interrelatedness of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all things and psychedelics are a </v>

481
00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:58.161
<v Speaker 2>catalyst for waking up and so once </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have that experience,</v>

482
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:03.030
<v Speaker 2>then their perspective has changed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>if they were influential,</v>

483
00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.970
<v Speaker 1>they can go out and make change on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>global scale.</v>

484
00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so important that Michael </v>
<v Speaker 1>Poem put out that book because the guy </v>

485
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:16.861
<v Speaker 1>who's a mainstream straight laced guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's written about architecture and </v>

486
00:27:16.861 --> 00:27:21.241
<v Speaker 1>agriculture and all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things where people like really respect </v>

487
00:27:21.241 --> 00:27:21.241
<v Speaker 1>his opinions and his word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

488
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:26.430
<v Speaker 1>this guy has not just written this book </v>
<v Speaker 1>but has also gone out in a limb and had </v>

489
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.590
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of different psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences in controlled settings.</v>

490
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And talks about them and the profound </v>

491
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:35.920
<v Speaker 1>impact that it had on his at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skeptical mind.</v>

492
00:27:35.921 --> 00:27:39.160
<v Speaker 1>He was very skeptical about what these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things were.</v>

493
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Yale though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Michael Pollan.</v>

494
00:27:41.981 --> 00:27:44.540
<v Speaker 1>I have for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>

495
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

496
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:49.530
<v Speaker 1>You just don't want any angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

497
00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've loved his work for a long time and </v>

498
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm really delighted that he's come out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and written about this.</v>

499
00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:01.380
<v Speaker 1>There are some things about his book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say that I'm a little </v>

500
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:05.851
<v Speaker 1>disappointed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I also have to say I'm only </v>

501
00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:07.270
<v Speaker 1>about a little over halfway through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was disappointing.</v>

502
00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far he hasn't really emphasized or </v>

503
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.781
<v Speaker 1>set much about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sort of writes it from the </v>

504
00:28:15.781 --> 00:28:18.871
<v Speaker 1>perspective that all of this started </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the discovery of Lsd in 1943 and </v>

505
00:28:19.571 --> 00:28:24.571
<v Speaker 1>then that was the psychedelic era there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their indigenous traditions,</v>

506
00:28:24.791 --> 00:28:27.410
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years old you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to.</v>

507
00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.590
<v Speaker 1>You hasn't really talked about those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

508
00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows they exist.</v>

509
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Did he talk to you at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

510
00:28:32.651 --> 00:28:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Not as ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare I was also,</v>

511
00:28:35.741 --> 00:28:40.741
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely jealous and angry and upset </v>

512
00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:40.741
<v Speaker 1>that he didn't talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

513
00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:41.860
<v Speaker 1>what the hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

514
00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.790
<v Speaker 1>but you've been banging at the bushes </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 60 years now.</v>

515
00:28:45.791 --> 00:28:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well come on man.</v>

516
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

517
00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm not shower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why he did that?</v>

518
00:28:52.281 --> 00:28:57.281
<v Speaker 2>If that was a conscious decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm kind of disappointed because I </v>

519
00:28:57.281 --> 00:28:58.500
<v Speaker 2>think I have a perspective that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

520
00:28:58.580 --> 00:28:59.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

521
00:28:59.091 --> 00:29:04.091
<v Speaker 2>I have some things to say that so far </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't been said in this book and </v>

522
00:29:04.091 --> 00:29:07.820
<v Speaker 2>things that Michael Pollan would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would completely relate to.</v>

523
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:13.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the one that brought up the idea </v>

524
00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:13.240
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

525
00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:16.720
<v Speaker 2>with respect to like plant domestication</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on our relationship with our food </v>

526
00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.210
<v Speaker 2>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

527
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.000
<v Speaker 2>we think we're growing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're cultivating plants.</v>

528
00:29:20.001 --> 00:29:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Actually plants are cold fading us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

529
00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:26.600
<v Speaker 2>this is plants program for world </v>
<v Speaker 2>domination,</v>

530
00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:31.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same is true of all these teacher </v>

531
00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:32.150
<v Speaker 2>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why they're out there,</v>

532
00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the global stage now and he didn't.</v>

533
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he will get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

534
00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:44.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm only mildly jealous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish he had talked to me on the other </v>

535
00:29:45.521 --> 00:29:50.521
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he has written is going to be </v>

536
00:29:50.521 --> 00:29:51.480
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be influential.</v>

537
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:56.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this will be influential to a small </v>

538
00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:59.630
<v Speaker 2>number of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pollin's book is going to bring it to </v>

539
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.630
<v Speaker 2>the attention of millions.</v>

540
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:04.890
<v Speaker 3>It's going to open people's eyes and and</v>
<v Speaker 3>refresh the way people view this whole </v>

541
00:30:05.661 --> 00:30:07.450
<v Speaker 3>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when you.</v>

542
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.480
<v Speaker 3>When you look at when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about ancient cultures and the use of </v>

543
00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.421
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics going back thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years and then this dip </v>

544
00:30:16.421 --> 00:30:20.710
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around 1970 where it almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to have gotten down to a very low </v>

545
00:30:20.961 --> 00:30:24.050
<v Speaker 3>hum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now the drums are beating again.</v>

546
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:26.060
<v Speaker 3>Coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's coming back.</v>

547
00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:31.150
<v Speaker 3>Know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really fascinated and excited by </v>

548
00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.671
<v Speaker 3>that because I think this is me too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's the answer to </v>

549
00:30:33.671 --> 00:30:35.390
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's the glue.</v>

550
00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:41.140
<v Speaker 3>I think it's there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing about the psychedelic </v>

551
00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:45.191
<v Speaker 3>experience that forces you to recognize </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have these pre established </v>

552
00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:51.711
<v Speaker 3>ideas of what things are and that you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of put them in these boxes and </v>

553
00:30:51.711 --> 00:30:52.650
<v Speaker 3>you've sort of pushed it away and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

554
00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:55.440
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've defined what a city is and I'm just</v>

555
00:30:55.441 --> 00:30:56.430
<v Speaker 3>gonna put that over there.</v>

556
00:30:56.430 --> 00:31:01.430
<v Speaker 3>Now I know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to think about that </v>

557
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.430
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've defined what a road is.</v>

558
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:06.430
<v Speaker 3>I've defined me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember after one of my first dmt </v>

559
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:10.011
<v Speaker 3>experiences just sitting around looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at roads differently like I was,</v>

560
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.580
<v Speaker 3>I was on a road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

561
00:31:11.581 --> 00:31:16.581
<v Speaker 3>this is the craziest shit ever week </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've decided that it's normal to lay </v>

562
00:31:16.581 --> 00:31:20.241
<v Speaker 3>this hard surface down on the ground so </v>
<v Speaker 3>we could roll these fire breathing.</v>

563
00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy,</v>

564
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.340
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was before that,</v>

565
00:31:26.341 --> 00:31:28.290
<v Speaker 3>it was just a rote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was always a road.</v>

566
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:33.620
<v Speaker 3>But after that it became this weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>symptom of what we're doing by erecting </v>

567
00:31:35.611 --> 00:31:37.800
<v Speaker 3>these massive structures in cities and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

568
00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need this,</v>

569
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.880
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this ground in order for us to use these</v>

570
00:31:41.881 --> 00:31:42.780
<v Speaker 3>vehicles on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And.</v>

571
00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:48.320
<v Speaker 3>But in the process of doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've sort of marred the landscape with </v>

572
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:48.320
<v Speaker 3>it everywhere.</v>

573
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

574
00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:53.500
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics do give us the chance to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rethink a lot of things.</v>

575
00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:56.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've talked before about um,</v>

576
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simon powells work he wrote about,</v>

577
00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.700
<v Speaker 2>he writes about Psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote,</v>

578
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the psilocybin solution and that was his</v>

579
00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:08.950
<v Speaker 2>first book and I think his latest is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>magic mushroom explorer.</v>

580
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:12.220
<v Speaker 2>But something in his work really struck </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

581
00:32:12.221 --> 00:32:17.221
<v Speaker 2>which is he pointed out that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look that psychedelics in some sense are</v>

582
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:23.640
<v Speaker 2>there scientific instruments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they give you an opportunity to look at </v>

583
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:28.081
<v Speaker 2>phenomena in a way that you've never </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at them before because they have </v>

584
00:32:28.081 --> 00:32:30.520
<v Speaker 2>this because they take you out of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>reference frame,</v>

585
00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:35.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they bring the background forward or </v>

586
00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:38.161
<v Speaker 2>there's different ways to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Poland actually describes it well </v>

587
00:32:38.161 --> 00:32:41.360
<v Speaker 2>when he talks about this disruption of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the default mode network,</v>

588
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:47.170
<v Speaker 2>it enables you to see patterns in nature</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're programmed not to see.</v>

589
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what our brain does,</v>

590
00:32:50.091 --> 00:32:55.091
<v Speaker 2>this whole reducing valve idea is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>filters many things out.</v>

591
00:32:56.271 --> 00:33:01.271
<v Speaker 2>It lets in just enough of the external </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that you can relate it to prior </v>

592
00:33:01.761 --> 00:33:06.761
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you think you know and you </v>

593
00:33:06.761 --> 00:33:08.060
<v Speaker 2>construct this artificial model of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality and that's the.</v>

594
00:33:08.061 --> 00:33:13.061
<v Speaker 2>That's what you inhabit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've said this many times may be </v>

595
00:33:13.061 --> 00:33:13.550
<v Speaker 2>worse than pollen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>may be better,</v>

596
00:33:13.551 --> 00:33:18.551
<v Speaker 2>but I talk about how you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're living in a hallucination </v>

597
00:33:18.551 --> 00:33:20.150
<v Speaker 2>essentially that's constructed by our </v>
<v Speaker 2>parades.</v>

598
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:26.600
<v Speaker 2>And in order to just deal with all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>information that is available,</v>

599
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:31.660
<v Speaker 2>it has to really restricted at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to put a choke on it so that what </v>

600
00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:36.610
<v Speaker 2>does get in can make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine for ordinary consciousness,</v>

601
00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:41.711
<v Speaker 2>but you are prone to overlook things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about reality that are important and </v>

602
00:33:43.461 --> 00:33:48.461
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics temporarily give you an </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to lower those,</v>

603
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:53.360
<v Speaker 2>lower those mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that default network or sometimes called</v>

604
00:33:53.361 --> 00:33:54.350
<v Speaker 2>neural gating.</v>

605
00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.090
<v Speaker 2>If you're in a safe place where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to worry about your safety,</v>

606
00:33:59.091 --> 00:34:01.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no saber tooth tiger,</v>

607
00:34:01.071 --> 00:34:02.600
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna come get you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

608
00:34:02.601 --> 00:34:04.760
<v Speaker 2>and so you don't have to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 2>your safety.</v>

609
00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Then you can just relax into it and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can appreciate things that are always </v>

610
00:34:10.941 --> 00:34:13.030
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that they're not there,</v>

611
00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:18.050
<v Speaker 2>these are not things you imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just things that you never </v>

612
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.050
<v Speaker 2>noticed because you're programmed not </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

613
00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:21.290
<v Speaker 2>So tremendous learning tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And many,</v>

614
00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:23.670
<v Speaker 2>many scientists have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

615
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:28.690
<v Speaker 2>their insights have come from their </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experience from Steve Jobs </v>

616
00:34:29.091 --> 00:34:32.350
<v Speaker 2>to crick to kary mullis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

617
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.630
<v Speaker 2>some of these folks admitted of others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deny it.</v>

618
00:34:35.631 --> 00:34:37.370
<v Speaker 2>But it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

619
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:42.400
<v Speaker 2>So there are many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many things we can learn from </v>

620
00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.720
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics that's only one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from a scientist's perspective,</v>

621
00:34:44.721 --> 00:34:47.390
<v Speaker 2>that's an important one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

622
00:34:47.391 --> 00:34:50.240
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I want to do is create</v>
<v Speaker 2>a system,</v>

623
00:34:50.241 --> 00:34:55.241
<v Speaker 2>a situation where you can bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>specialists together in different disc </v>

624
00:34:55.241 --> 00:34:56.240
<v Speaker 2>or in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a discipline,</v>

625
00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:01.840
<v Speaker 2>say mathematics or quantum physics or </v>
<v Speaker 2>astronomy or even whatever art and have </v>

626
00:35:05.271 --> 00:35:07.650
<v Speaker 2>these collective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

627
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:12.200
<v Speaker 2>sessions together and then let people </v>
<v Speaker 2>share their insight,</v>

628
00:35:12.201 --> 00:35:16.760
<v Speaker 2>essentially creative solving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem solving or creative sessions.</v>

629
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.600
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

630
00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

631
00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.640
<v Speaker 2>that's the other thing I think we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for,</v>

632
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:27.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to develop a context in which </v>

633
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:28.520
<v Speaker 2>these things can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

634
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.500
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

635
00:35:31.501 --> 00:35:36.501
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the restrictions of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the strictly clinical approach that I</v>

636
00:35:37.801 --> 00:35:39.750
<v Speaker 2>chafe against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

637
00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have to be,</v>

638
00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a problem.</v>

639
00:35:46.321 --> 00:35:50.490
<v Speaker 2>It has to be to treat something </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression or ptsd or whatever.</v>

640
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.440
<v Speaker 2>But we really need to use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

641
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.310
<v Speaker 2>that's not the only thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelics are good for sure.</v>

642
00:35:56.311 --> 00:36:01.311
<v Speaker 2>They can help people with mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems and in our society who doesn't </v>

643
00:36:01.501 --> 00:36:03.450
<v Speaker 2>have mental problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

644
00:36:03.451 --> 00:36:05.790
<v Speaker 2>as a society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're wounded,</v>

645
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:11.300
<v Speaker 2>but it goes beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are learning tools and teaching </v>

646
00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.320
<v Speaker 2>tools and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

647
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.280
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

648
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.640
<v Speaker 2>you begin to see some of this in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

649
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.650
<v Speaker 2>in the work that Roland Griffith is </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

650
00:36:19.651 --> 00:36:24.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been able to get approval for </v>

651
00:36:24.651 --> 00:36:26.700
<v Speaker 2>people to take psilocybin for spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 2>development,</v>

652
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:31.320
<v Speaker 2>which is not exactly an illness for </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual spiritual insights.</v>

653
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's approved to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is approved to do it and who approved</v>

654
00:36:35.371 --> 00:36:37.710
<v Speaker 2>this and how's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The FDA approved it.</v>

655
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:41.430
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a clinical study going on right</v>

656
00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:45.870
<v Speaker 2>now where he's recruiting a religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>professionals,</v>

657
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.420
<v Speaker 2>people who are pastors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>priests,</v>

658
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.250
<v Speaker 2>rabbis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moms,</v>

659
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:55.310
<v Speaker 2>other types of religious professionals </v>
<v Speaker 2>and putting them through his protocol </v>

660
00:36:55.990 --> 00:37:00.990
<v Speaker 2>and that's having a tremendous impact on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they view their profession on </v>

661
00:37:01.501 --> 00:37:04.860
<v Speaker 2>the way they be religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fantastic.</v>

662
00:37:04.861 --> 00:37:05.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

663
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:10.050
<v Speaker 2>it really is a shame that we need an </v>
<v Speaker 2>illness to treat for you.</v>

664
00:37:10.051 --> 00:37:13.080
<v Speaker 2>Allow someone to have this potentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind expanding experience,</v>

665
00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:18.081
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost like not allowing people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take vitamins unless they're really </v>

666
00:37:18.081 --> 00:37:18.081
<v Speaker 2>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

667
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:22.290
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like Bob Jesse says very eloquently,</v>

668
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:28.010
<v Speaker 2>we need to find context in which we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>use psychedelics for the betterment of </v>

669
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.860
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

670
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:31.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the improvement of them.</v>

671
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:31.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

672
00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:37.460
<v Speaker 2>and you can't do it right now under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>current regulatory restrictions now.</v>

673
00:37:37.831 --> 00:37:41.550
<v Speaker 2>I think it's improved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it gradually will improve.</v>

674
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this sort of ties into a,</v>

675
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm trying to do now,</v>

676
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.980
<v Speaker 2>now that I've got this book off my </v>
<v Speaker 2>plate.</v>

677
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:55.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is kind of a kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucket list item.</v>

678
00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:58.680
<v Speaker 2>Something that I've wanted to do for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time and now it's done.</v>

679
00:37:58.681 --> 00:38:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Now I have to help help sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that won't be too much of a problem.</v>

680
00:38:02.431 --> 00:38:06.090
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a beautiful book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially after a year or two after our</v>

681
00:38:06.091 --> 00:38:07.230
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll probably,</v>

682
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:11.030
<v Speaker 2>we only published a thousand copies of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those gone.</v>

683
00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.540
<v Speaker 2>It would be sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

684
00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:15.600
<v Speaker 2>a collector's edition and that was on </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>

685
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.770
<v Speaker 2>We can always print more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it really is beautifully done,</v>

686
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:20.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

687
00:38:20.791 --> 00:38:23.080
<v Speaker 2>it is a beautiful book on every level </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

688
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:27.420
<v Speaker 2>and the people that contributed to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the second volume,</v>

689
00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:32.421
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want all the same people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>come to all always come to these </v>

690
00:38:32.421 --> 00:38:34.170
<v Speaker 2>conferences and only say the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

691
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:37.840
<v Speaker 2>So some of the people in there are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>that well known,</v>

692
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're known.</v>

693
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:44.110
<v Speaker 2>They were known to me and I felt that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had important things to say.</v>

694
00:38:44.111 --> 00:38:45.490
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

695
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:50.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them are known within the </v>

696
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560
<v Speaker 2>community and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and others are pretty obscure,</v>

697
00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:51.330
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

698
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.610
<v Speaker 2>there's always this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

699
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.230
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

700
00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:00.100
<v Speaker 2>this passionate amateur type person who </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they don't have credentials,</v>

701
00:39:00.101 --> 00:39:03.630
<v Speaker 2>but they have incredible knowledge up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their head and they're,</v>

702
00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.100
<v Speaker 2>they're completely obsessed with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

703
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.040
<v Speaker 2>And there was a few of those people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there too.</v>

704
00:39:09.041 --> 00:39:11.680
<v Speaker 2>So it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really a really.</v>

705
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:16.710
<v Speaker 2>It was really satisfying to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it and make it worth people's </v>

706
00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:21.040
<v Speaker 2>People's time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was able to pay for,</v>

707
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:26.250
<v Speaker 2>well me and my supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it came through the Institute </v>

708
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:31.290
<v Speaker 2>of Ecotechnics actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that turned out to be a good nonprofit </v>

709
00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:31.780
<v Speaker 2>channel through which we could get </v>
<v Speaker 2>donations,</v>

710
00:39:31.781 --> 00:39:33.100
<v Speaker 2>grants essentially.</v>

711
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't want it to go through heffter </v>

712
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:38.770
<v Speaker 2>because it might look like a conflict of</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest,</v>

713
00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.660
<v Speaker 2>silly notion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

714
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.530
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

715
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.440
<v Speaker 2>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

716
00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.530
<v Speaker 2>we were able to pull this off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We produced the book.</v>

717
00:39:47.531 --> 00:39:50.620
<v Speaker 2>We even gave everybody a modest </v>
<v Speaker 2>honorarium.</v>

718
00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:53.680
<v Speaker 2>So that's the way conferences are </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be.</v>

719
00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:58.960
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening for me now and actually</v>

720
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:02.650
<v Speaker 2>predates this and has been for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time is,</v>

721
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:08.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing a lot of work in Peru </v>

722
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.771
<v Speaker 2>for really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been hosting retreats for Iowasca </v>

723
00:40:10.771 --> 00:40:13.090
<v Speaker 2>since about 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

724
00:40:13.091 --> 00:40:16.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been very gratifying work.</v>

725
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:21.360
<v Speaker 2>I've seen transformations in people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what a difference it makes to </v>

726
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:27.660
<v Speaker 2>create the right environment and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>people able to come and in a safe place.</v>

727
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.330
<v Speaker 2>And my whole approach and the people I </v>
<v Speaker 2>work with,</v>

728
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.360
<v Speaker 2>there are whole approaches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not here to tell you what's </v>

729
00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:39.360
<v Speaker 2>supposed to happen.</v>

730
00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:43.180
<v Speaker 2>We're here to create an optimum </v>
<v Speaker 2>condition and you work it out.</v>

731
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:48.390
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a dialogue between you and the </v>

732
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.850
<v Speaker 2>plant teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

733
00:40:48.851 --> 00:40:50.620
<v Speaker 2>it's not the Shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Shaman,</v>

734
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:52.420
<v Speaker 2>if it's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a good showman,</v>

735
00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:56.680
<v Speaker 2>facilitates that process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but does not try to control it.</v>

736
00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:01.090
<v Speaker 2>He's there for support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He or she is there for support.</v>

737
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.320
<v Speaker 2>What really happens is the interaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>

738
00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

739
00:41:06.401 --> 00:41:08.860
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the medicines or the real teachers.</v>

740
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:14.190
<v Speaker 2>And we're here to facilitate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also to tell people if they need </v>

741
00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:19.060
<v Speaker 2>help integrating it or figuring it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

742
00:41:19.061 --> 00:41:20.590
<v Speaker 2>But that's different than saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

743
00:41:20.591 --> 00:41:23.800
<v Speaker 2>this means that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're supposed to think about it.</v>

744
00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:27.130
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to think about whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>

745
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:28.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

746
00:41:28.211 --> 00:41:32.380
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to learn to use your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind to think for yourself.</v>

747
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:38.170
<v Speaker 2>So the extension of this is that I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the process,</v>

748
00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:39.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

749
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:45.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess manifesting this idea and uh,</v>

750
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:51.580
<v Speaker 2>what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm working on now is I want to </v>

751
00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.870
<v Speaker 2>create an academy in the Sacred Valley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

752
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:58.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an academy of natural philosophy and </v>

753
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.550
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>

754
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:04.820
<v Speaker 2>And so I have a name for it because a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people have told me that,</v>

755
00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:05.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

756
00:42:05.481 --> 00:42:07.940
<v Speaker 2>your name has got to be in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this,</v>

757
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.690
<v Speaker 2>and I'm a kind of a selfie facing guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

758
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recognize that I have a certain iconic</v>

759
00:42:14.961 --> 00:42:16.070
<v Speaker 2>recognition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

760
00:42:16.071 --> 00:42:17.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's what it takes,</v>

761
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:23.500
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we're going to call it is the </v>

762
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Mckenna Academy for Natural Philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

763
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.630
<v Speaker 2>by academy you're saying you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a physical structure.</v>

764
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.170
<v Speaker 2>We will have a physical structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

765
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:37.360
<v Speaker 2>And maybe more than one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have identified an initial place </v>

766
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.130
<v Speaker 2>that will be the physical location for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

767
00:42:40.131 --> 00:42:41.810
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a kind of school.</v>

768
00:42:41.811 --> 00:42:46.811
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is in fact the first psychedelic </v>

769
00:42:46.811 --> 00:42:47.480
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>

770
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:52.840
<v Speaker 2>sense this was sacked and burned by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>goths in three 96 a day.</v>

771
00:42:53.161 --> 00:42:58.161
<v Speaker 2>It's the first psychedelic university in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the western tradition since then.</v>

772
00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.520
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to have structured </v>
<v Speaker 2>courses,</v>

773
00:43:01.521 --> 00:43:03.830
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

774
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:06.200
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have courses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have.</v>

775
00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.200
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be much more than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>retreat center.</v>

776
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:13.610
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have retreats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have therapeutic programs</v>

777
00:43:13.611 --> 00:43:17.810
<v Speaker 2>for people to get treatment and programs</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people to,</v>

778
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:20.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn to use psychedelics for therapists</v>

779
00:43:20.941 --> 00:43:25.130
<v Speaker 2>to learn to use them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is not the whole program.</v>

780
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:27.890
<v Speaker 2>The idea that we're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>conferences,</v>

781
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.190
<v Speaker 2>global impact conferences along the </v>
<v Speaker 2>model of this,</v>

782
00:43:32.191 --> 00:43:33.020
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

783
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:37.280
<v Speaker 2>this conference was what made me realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>this possible.</v>

784
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:42.670
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have impactful </v>
<v Speaker 2>conferences that will really have a </v>

785
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:44.280
<v Speaker 2>global reach and through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

786
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:47.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>webinars,</v>

787
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:52.070
<v Speaker 2>what through the web we can share this </v>
<v Speaker 2>with thousands of people and it will be </v>

788
00:43:52.221 --> 00:43:55.760
<v Speaker 2>a place for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be a place for,</v>

789
00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:58.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second part of the,</v>

790
00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:03.910
<v Speaker 2>of the title is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's the mechanic academy of natural </v>

791
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.910
<v Speaker 2>philosophy.</v>

792
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:09.100
<v Speaker 2>What's natural philosophy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Natural philosophy is what science used </v>

793
00:44:09.591 --> 00:44:14.591
<v Speaker 2>to be called before it became corrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before it became preoccupied with </v>

794
00:44:15.801 --> 00:44:18.740
<v Speaker 2>quantitation before it became </v>
<v Speaker 2>reductionist.</v>

795
00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:24.340
<v Speaker 2>All of the things that have constricted </v>
<v Speaker 2>the scope of science.</v>

796
00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:29.590
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be a more open thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't depend on corporate funding</v>

797
00:44:29.631 --> 00:44:32.760
<v Speaker 2>and that sort of thing where first of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

798
00:44:32.761 --> 00:44:37.761
<v Speaker 2>we recognize that scientific knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>is valuable and we embrace that.</v>

799
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:42.330
<v Speaker 2>But we also recognize that they has </v>
<v Speaker 2>inherent limitations,</v>

800
00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:47.360
<v Speaker 2>just by the nature of the beast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has hinton inherent limitations on </v>

801
00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.220
<v Speaker 2>certain things are difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

802
00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:54.570
<v Speaker 2>to investigate within that rigid </v>
<v Speaker 2>framework.</v>

803
00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:55.510
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are,</v>

804
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.320
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean they're not worthy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation,</v>

805
00:44:58.321 --> 00:45:00.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean psychedelic experiences.</v>

806
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Very difficult to investigate as many </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things,</v>

807
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:05.160
<v Speaker 2>paranormal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

808
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things that people,</v>

809
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:10.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stigmatized as,</v>

810
00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:13.130
<v Speaker 2>as Wu and crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

811
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:14.690
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to.</v>

812
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:19.080
<v Speaker 2>The idea is to bring rigor to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things to say yes,</v>

813
00:45:19.081 --> 00:45:22.170
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of phenomena that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand.</v>

814
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.630
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a normal phenomenon fascinates</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

815
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.000
<v Speaker 2>will you name it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

816
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:30.240
<v Speaker 2>Ufo shows is a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

817
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:33.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody really knows what's going on with</v>

818
00:45:33.151 --> 00:45:38.151
<v Speaker 2>you for all we know is that people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these experiences and what are they,</v>

819
00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:43.770
<v Speaker 2>what are those experiences?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they extraterrestrial encounters?</v>

820
00:45:43.771 --> 00:45:48.771
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them don't really fit that </v>

821
00:45:48.771 --> 00:45:51.140
<v Speaker 2>mold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they hallucinations or altered </v>

822
00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:54.960
<v Speaker 2>states or is there really something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

823
00:45:54.961 --> 00:45:57.690
<v Speaker 2>in the continuum that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

824
00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:02.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that only manifests under certain </v>

825
00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:03.900
<v Speaker 2>circumstances and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea is that,</v>

826
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:07.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>

827
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:13.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in this era tends to </v>

828
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:16.461
<v Speaker 2>transform itself into Dogma and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>that becomes dismissive of aspects of </v>

829
00:46:19.831 --> 00:46:24.831
<v Speaker 2>the world that are worthy of studying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't fit into the scientific </v>

830
00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:25.530
<v Speaker 2>pattern.</v>

831
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:27.150
<v Speaker 2>And so we dismissed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

832
00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:30.060
<v Speaker 2>a good example of this is Graham </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hancock's work,</v>

833
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:35.390
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he talks about and many other </v>

834
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:38.061
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream archeology is not open to </v>

835
00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:41.751
<v Speaker 2>this idea that becoming more open to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>by force data too because more and more </v>

836
00:46:41.941 --> 00:46:43.560
<v Speaker 2>evidence is showing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>

837
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.400
<v Speaker 2>look at how long it's taken him to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

838
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:51.530
<v Speaker 2>knocking on the doors bed and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people over the head practically that </v>

839
00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:54.810
<v Speaker 2>look at this evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very nice though to see him finally</v>

840
00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:58.650
<v Speaker 2>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is pretty far from over,</v>

841
00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.490
<v Speaker 2>but he's definitely gaining ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely gaining go for Allie Tabay.</v>

842
00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And can you imagine how that would </v>

843
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.720
<v Speaker 2>change our view of humanity or </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution,</v>

844
00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.270
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So archeology is a good,</v>

845
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:15.720
<v Speaker 2>a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelics are another good example.</v>

846
00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:20.740
<v Speaker 2>It's opening up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for years after the initial </v>

847
00:47:21.271 --> 00:47:24.210
<v Speaker 2>excitement about psychedelics and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fifties and sixties,</v>

848
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:26.880
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing was suppressed for 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

849
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Michael Pollan talks about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're doing now is rediscovering,</v>

850
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:36.870
<v Speaker 2>you were a psychiatrist in training in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the eighties or the seventies or the </v>

851
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.250
<v Speaker 2>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wanted to talk about psychedelics.</v>

852
00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:44.980
<v Speaker 2>That was the end of your career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could not even bring this up,</v>

853
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

854
00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:51.380
<v Speaker 3>and who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's one of these situations where </v>

855
00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:56.000
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of stunning when you think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the fact that in the sixties it </v>

856
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.351
<v Speaker 3>probably was possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was before it was made completely </v>

857
00:48:00.351 --> 00:48:03.561
<v Speaker 3>illegal to discuss and I'm on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conference was performed by the </v>

858
00:48:03.561 --> 00:48:04.590
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1967.</v>

859
00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:09.240
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the laws changed and laws about</v>

860
00:48:09.241 --> 00:48:14.241
<v Speaker 3>these sorts of things should never be </v>
<v Speaker 3>made by politicians because they always </v>

861
00:48:14.241 --> 00:48:14.241
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

862
00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:19.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a different agenda and they're not </v>

863
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.300
<v Speaker 2>qualified to make these kinds of laws </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're largely,</v>

864
00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:26.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>idiots or the ones that really control </v>

865
00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.500
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not informed about psychedelics.</v>

866
00:48:29.501 --> 00:48:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelics were blankets prohibited </v>
<v Speaker 2>all at once,</v>

867
00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:34.870
<v Speaker 2>pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>

868
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:39.800
<v Speaker 2>the focus was all on Lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these other things got swept up into</v>

869
00:48:39.801 --> 00:48:44.801
<v Speaker 2>this hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially this hysteria that </v>

870
00:48:44.801 --> 00:48:47.690
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics were gonna change the youth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Change Society.</v>

871
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:49.730
<v Speaker 2>And you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were right?</v>

872
00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:53.790
<v Speaker 2>They were absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were not stupid in that sense.</v>

873
00:48:53.791 --> 00:48:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

874
00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:58.540
<v Speaker 2>it did bring out these changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now we're past that.</v>

875
00:48:58.570 --> 00:48:59.110
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

876
00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:01.750
<v Speaker 3>sciences again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slowly opening up,</v>

877
00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:03.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

878
00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:05.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to psychedelics.</v>

879
00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:07.720
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

880
00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:12.930
<v Speaker 3>I think people were appreciative of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that we know that we have gone </v>

881
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:16.351
<v Speaker 3>through that dip where it was outlawed </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stigmatized and people were never </v>

882
00:49:16.351 --> 00:49:16.360
<v Speaker 3>talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

883
00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a few years ago,</v>

884
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:21.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say early two thousands.</v>

885
00:49:21.471 --> 00:49:26.471
<v Speaker 3>You talk about mushrooms or any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics and people would look at </v>

886
00:49:26.471 --> 00:49:26.471
<v Speaker 3>you like you're crazy.</v>

887
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

888
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to his credit,</v>

889
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:34.950
<v Speaker 2>he was one who continued to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it all through the seventies,</v>

890
00:49:35.561 --> 00:49:37.690
<v Speaker 2>the eighties and nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

891
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:42.670
<v Speaker 2>and I give him tremendous credit for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because he was dismissed and he was</v>

892
00:49:42.671 --> 00:49:47.671
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a pioneer and I think he really </v>

893
00:49:47.671 --> 00:49:49.600
<v Speaker 2>had a lot to do with keeping this </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation alive.</v>

894
00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:53.440
<v Speaker 2>That along with the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

895
00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:58.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>largely through our efforts back in the </v>

896
00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:02.321
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but other people contributed like </v>

897
00:50:02.321 --> 00:50:03.740
<v Speaker 2>statements of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we published this little pamphlet,</v>

898
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:08.770
<v Speaker 2>the psilocybin mushroom magic grower's </v>
<v Speaker 2>guide which put in the hands of,</v>

899
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:14.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every nerdy 10th grader essentially the </v>

900
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:18.251
<v Speaker 2>tools to grow psilocybin mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how it got out to the world </v>

901
00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.470
<v Speaker 2>and our motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we did that,</v>

902
00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.440
<v Speaker 2>it was partly mercenaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

903
00:50:24.441 --> 00:50:26.330
<v Speaker 2>we can grow mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a lot of money.</v>

904
00:50:26.331 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we grew mushrooms,</v>

905
00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:33.110
<v Speaker 1>we made some money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the real motivation is we wanted </v>

906
00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:35.540
<v Speaker 1>people to be able to verify our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

907
00:50:35.541 --> 00:50:40.541
<v Speaker 1>The stuff that we experienced at La </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chorrera was so nuts that we thought </v>

908
00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.270
<v Speaker 1>either we're completely diluted or </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on here.</v>

909
00:50:44.271 --> 00:50:49.070
<v Speaker 1>So we needed affirmation from a wider </v>
<v Speaker 1>community that,</v>

910
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:54.160
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is really weird shit going on </v>

911
00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:54.410
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we put it out and it's now,</v>

912
00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:59.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms are probably a for,</v>

913
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:05.290
<v Speaker 1>I'd say for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the first psychedelic that they </v>

914
00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:05.290
<v Speaker 1>encounter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

915
00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:09.850
<v Speaker 1>maybe lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But chances are these days it's </v>

916
00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:09.850
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

917
00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:10.700
<v Speaker 1>your brother was such a compelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaker.</v>

918
00:51:10.701 --> 00:51:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrence was so interesting.</v>

919
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Like his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his speech pattern was fascinating.</v>

920
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was part of the thing.</v>

921
00:51:18.261 --> 00:51:23.261
<v Speaker 1>It was the theater of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his speeches and lectures there were so </v>

922
00:51:23.261 --> 00:51:23.890
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

923
00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:26.400
<v Speaker 1>And he also was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

924
00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:31.730
<v Speaker 1>he was so obviously engrossed in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjects to the point where he's very,</v>

925
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.250
<v Speaker 1>very attached to them.</v>

926
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:37.760
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a deep connection and he,</v>

927
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:42.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you would hear him talk and be </v>

928
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.790
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

929
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.790
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get some of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

930
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

931
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:44.120
<v Speaker 1>he was a compelling speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

932
00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:45.170
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

933
00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't rise to that level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

934
00:51:47.901 --> 00:51:50.810
<v Speaker 1>I've just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although occasionally,</v>

935
00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:53.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can kind of channel him,</v>

936
00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.890
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have stuff to say.</v>

937
00:51:54.891 --> 00:51:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't say it as well as he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

938
00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:00.680
<v Speaker 1>we were so much on the same wavelength </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

939
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:02.090
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

940
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:06.560
<v Speaker 1>he was the bard of psychedelics </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the seventies,</v>

941
00:52:06.561 --> 00:52:10.100
<v Speaker 1>eighties and nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and refused to,</v>

942
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when no one else was talking about it,</v>

943
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:16.760
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I gave him a lot of credit for.</v>

944
00:52:16.761 --> 00:52:18.640
<v Speaker 1>He kept the emperor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

945
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To do that.</v>

946
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:22.040
<v Speaker 1>When you were talking about La Chorrera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

947
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:27.070
<v Speaker 1>your experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't you guys have some sort of a ufo </v>

948
00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:27.070
<v Speaker 1>experience when you were there?</v>

949
00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did.</v>

950
00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Or he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

951
00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

952
00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

953
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:35.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recently,</v>

954
00:52:35.601 --> 00:52:40.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about Lacera probably far </v>

955
00:52:40.601 --> 00:52:43.661
<v Speaker 1>too much and I don't really like to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it too much because it's so hard </v>

956
00:52:43.761 --> 00:52:45.190
<v Speaker 1>to explain and with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

957
00:52:45.191 --> 00:52:45.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>

958
00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:48.760
<v Speaker 1>to discuss it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get off into these for,</v>

959
00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:53.860
<v Speaker 1>for the uninitiated that we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in project into these rabbit holes</v>

960
00:52:54.561 --> 00:52:56.150
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of explaining.</v>

961
00:52:56.151 --> 00:52:57.630
<v Speaker 1>But I gave a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

962
00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:02.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lecturer to breaking convention </v>
<v Speaker 1>last year in the UK and in at the end of</v>

963
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:09.500
<v Speaker 1>June they have breaking convention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another big psychedelic conference.</v>

964
00:53:09.501 --> 00:53:14.501
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my title of my talk was the experiment </v>

965
00:53:14.611 --> 00:53:17.870
<v Speaker 1>at Lusher era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotic break,</v>

966
00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:22.930
<v Speaker 1>shamonic initiation or alien encounter </v>
<v Speaker 1>question mark.</v>

967
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:25.620
<v Speaker 1>We're all of the above or all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>above.</v>

968
00:53:25.621 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>

969
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:31.100
<v Speaker 2>the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my sort of the theme of this talk </v>

970
00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:35.301
<v Speaker 2>was if you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

971
00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:37.390
<v Speaker 2>what you might call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

972
00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:38.160
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

973
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:40.200
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the topology,</v>

974
00:53:40.201 --> 00:53:45.201
<v Speaker 2>the typology of alien encounters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are certain patterns that come up </v>

975
00:53:45.201 --> 00:53:48.690
<v Speaker 2>again and again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you tick those off,</v>

976
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:50.370
<v Speaker 2>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

977
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:55.520
<v Speaker 2>for the experiment lecturer era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all present in a certain way and</v>

978
00:53:55.641 --> 00:53:57.100
<v Speaker 2>there has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

979
00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:00.900
<v Speaker 2>the typical alien encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of an oxymoron.</v>

980
00:54:00.901 --> 00:54:05.901
<v Speaker 2>What's typical about an alien encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are certain characteristics </v>

981
00:54:05.901 --> 00:54:10.520
<v Speaker 2>and one of the characteristics is there </v>
<v Speaker 2>has to be a calling and there has to be </v>

982
00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:14.871
<v Speaker 2>a siren call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Write something compels you like in a,</v>

983
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:20.840
<v Speaker 2>in a Spielberg movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>close encounters of the third kind that </v>

984
00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:20.840
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

985
00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.440
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the table mountain,</v>

986
00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:26.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and somehow this guy was compelled to go</v>

987
00:54:26.131 --> 00:54:26.490
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

988
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:29.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a siren call in,</v>

989
00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.410
<v Speaker 2>in our experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was DMT,</v>

990
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we were just students,</v>

991
00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terence was at Berkeley,</v>

992
00:54:36.301 --> 00:54:41.301
<v Speaker 2>I was in University of Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were both fascinated by dmt and </v>

993
00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:47.120
<v Speaker 2>we were compelled to go look for this </v>
<v Speaker 2>orally active form of DMT.</v>

994
00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:48.570
<v Speaker 2>Woo Hoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>

995
00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Which when we finally got it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned out to be not very exciting,</v>

996
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.050
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took us to La Chorrera.</v>

997
00:54:55.051 --> 00:54:58.680
<v Speaker 2>That's why we went to Lucha Libre was in</v>
<v Speaker 2>quest of this thing,</v>

998
00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:02.910
<v Speaker 2>which we called the secret when we got </v>
<v Speaker 2>to La Chorrera what was really.</v>

999
00:55:02.911 --> 00:55:07.911
<v Speaker 2>There were mushrooms everywhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pasture that quickly reorganized our </v>

1000
00:55:08.971 --> 00:55:10.470
<v Speaker 2>priorities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1001
00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:15.530
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was though we were in the </v>

1002
00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:16.530
<v Speaker 2>presence of this intelligence and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>presented itself very much.</v>

1003
00:55:16.531 --> 00:55:21.531
<v Speaker 2>We called it the teacher and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>downloading all of this information to </v>

1004
00:55:21.601 --> 00:55:26.601
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was another characteristic of,</v>

1005
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.320
<v Speaker 2>of alien encounters.</v>

1006
00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Generic alien encounters usually involve</v>
<v Speaker 2>the transfer of special information.</v>

1007
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.910
<v Speaker 2>People are shown a book or they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>shown,</v>

1008
00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:37.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1009
00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:41.790
<v Speaker 2>something that is transmitted from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher to the recipient.</v>

1010
00:55:41.791 --> 00:55:43.920
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got that in spades.</v>

1011
00:55:43.921 --> 00:55:48.921
<v Speaker 2>We got this encounter and it had those </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics.</v>

1012
00:55:49.291 --> 00:55:52.620
<v Speaker 2>And then another characteristic is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1013
00:55:52.621 --> 00:55:57.621
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so information is given and gifts are </v>

1014
00:55:57.621 --> 00:55:57.840
<v Speaker 2>given,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1015
00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:02.900
<v Speaker 2>and the information that was transmitted</v>
<v Speaker 2>resulted in a couple of things.</v>

1016
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the primary thing that that came out of </v>

1017
00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.650
<v Speaker 2>that was terrence's idea about the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>about timewave and teaching.</v>

1018
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:16.870
<v Speaker 2>The genesis of that idea came out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment that lecturer and then over </v>

1019
00:56:17.401 --> 00:56:22.050
<v Speaker 2>decades became refined and developed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1020
00:56:22.051 --> 00:56:25.630
<v Speaker 2>whether there's any to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

1021
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:28.640
<v Speaker 2>I've always been very skeptical about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1022
00:56:28.641 --> 00:56:31.060
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it failed its major test,</v>

1023
00:56:31.061 --> 00:56:36.061
<v Speaker 2>which is the space time continuum did </v>
<v Speaker 2>not collapse on December 20,</v>

1024
00:56:37.241 --> 00:56:39.460
<v Speaker 2>first 2012 as was predicted.</v>

1025
00:56:39.550 --> 00:56:42.220
<v Speaker 2>But there are interesting things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1026
00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:47.280
<v Speaker 2>about the timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's just an interesting thing </v>

1027
00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.370
<v Speaker 2>considered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1028
00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:54.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in its own context as a strange </v>

1029
00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:58.080
<v Speaker 2>mathematic whole construction that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>many ways as a reflection of terrence's </v>

1030
00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:04.440
<v Speaker 2>psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the only one that could really </v>

1031
00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:07.441
<v Speaker 2>understand it and interpret it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a bunch of people listening </v>

1032
00:57:07.441 --> 00:57:07.441
<v Speaker 2>probably don't know what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1033
00:57:07.441 --> 00:57:09.010
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about timewave zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>timewave zero,</v>

1034
00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:14.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we wrote the invisible landscape in </v>

1035
00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.130
<v Speaker 2>our first book for people who have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea what we're talking about.</v>

1036
00:57:15.131 --> 00:57:16.660
<v Speaker 2>Explain what timewave zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1037
00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Rhythm essentially that he essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an algorithm based on the </v>

1038
00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:26.781
<v Speaker 2>structure of the each thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This oracle of 64 hexagrams,</v>

1039
00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:32.280
<v Speaker 2>and he treated it in such a way that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>claimed it,</v>

1040
00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:37.770
<v Speaker 2>it describes that time had a structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that this thing was that this,</v>

1041
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:43.270
<v Speaker 2>this timewave describe the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time essentially,</v>

1042
00:57:43.271 --> 00:57:46.780
<v Speaker 2>and thus was a predictive tool among </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things.</v>

1043
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.820
<v Speaker 2>And that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1044
00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:53.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a way to look at the ingression of </v>

1045
00:57:54.341 --> 00:57:59.341
<v Speaker 2>novelty into the continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that there really are new </v>

1046
00:57:59.341 --> 00:58:04.321
<v Speaker 2>things under the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new things happen that have never </v>

1047
00:58:04.321 --> 00:58:06.580
<v Speaker 2>happened before ever in the history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe.</v>

1048
00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:11.610
<v Speaker 2>And this map was a way to predict the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eruption of those things or the </v>

1049
00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.840
<v Speaker 2>ingression of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1050
00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:17.500
<v Speaker 2>which is a better term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And terrence and I used to have,</v>

1051
00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:20.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't call them arguments,</v>

1052
00:58:20.441 --> 00:58:23.020
<v Speaker 2>I'd call them heated discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1053
00:58:23.021 --> 00:58:25.750
<v Speaker 2>or enthusiastic discussions about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>this happened.</v>

1054
00:58:25.751 --> 00:58:29.650
<v Speaker 2>I do not disagree with the principle </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is novelty.</v>

1055
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:33.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure the timewave really </v>
<v Speaker 2>describes it adequately,</v>

1056
00:58:33.431 --> 00:58:35.860
<v Speaker 2>but it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a attempt to,</v>

1057
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.490
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatever it was,</v>

1058
00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:44.320
<v Speaker 2>it was something that was a gift from </v>
<v Speaker 2>this teacher,</v>

1059
00:58:44.321 --> 00:58:47.320
<v Speaker 2>at least the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nugget of the idea that.</v>

1060
00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that came back,</v>

1061
00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:55.530
<v Speaker 2>the other gift that came back from La </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chorrera was nothing supernatural or </v>

1062
00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:01.270
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gift was the spores of the mushroom.</v>

1063
00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:07.020
<v Speaker 2>We took the spores of the mushroom and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we took them back with us and then over </v>

1064
00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:11.641
<v Speaker 2>two or three years we figured out how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>grow them and we shared that with the </v>

1065
00:59:11.641 --> 00:59:15.790
<v Speaker 2>rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was really the thing that,</v>

1066
00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:18.970
<v Speaker 2>and look at the impact that that's had </v>
<v Speaker 2>on society.</v>

1067
00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:21.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and terrence was fond of saying,</v>

1068
00:59:21.351 --> 00:59:22.910
<v Speaker 2>terrence did say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1069
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:27.940
<v Speaker 2>we are in a symbiotic relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that has disguised itself as </v>

1070
00:59:29.871 --> 00:59:33.590
<v Speaker 2>an alien invasion in order not to alarm </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

1071
00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:36.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1072
00:59:36.550 --> 00:59:37.850
<v Speaker 2>and that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1073
00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:41.780
<v Speaker 2>and before you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every nerdy 10th year,</v>

1074
00:59:41.781 --> 00:59:45.410
<v Speaker 2>a 10 year old in basements across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

1075
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:50.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're growing mushrooms and able to do </v>

1076
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.840
<v Speaker 2>it because the [inaudible] the technique</v>
<v Speaker 2>was very simple.</v>

1077
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:54.050
<v Speaker 2>So it's all about what's Johnny doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>down in the basement,</v>

1078
00:59:54.051 --> 00:59:54.620
<v Speaker 2>honey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1079
00:59:54.621 --> 00:59:56.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some science project,</v>

1080
00:59:56.631 --> 01:00:01.631
<v Speaker 2>something about growing mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So effectively the alien invasion was a </v>

1081
01:00:02.961 --> 01:00:06.470
<v Speaker 2>complete success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a shot was fired,</v>

1082
01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:11.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now here we are and no one's even </v>

1083
01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.111
<v Speaker 2>realized that it's an alien invasion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you subscribe to the idea that </v>

1084
01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:18.191
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms came here and perhaps on </v>
<v Speaker 2>asteroids that it was a Panspermia sort </v>

1085
01:00:18.191 --> 01:00:18.480
<v Speaker 2>of situation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1086
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't subscribe to that idea.</v>

1087
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Whose idea was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1088
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:25.610
<v Speaker 2>terrence's idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1089
01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:30.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea of Panspermia I don't </v>

1090
01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.780
<v Speaker 2>necessarily disagree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that may well have happened.</v>

1091
01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1092
01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:39.490
<v Speaker 2>that that life came from on an asteroid </v>
<v Speaker 2>or is the building blocks the building </v>

1093
01:00:40.611 --> 01:00:43.100
<v Speaker 2>blocks of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But mushrooms as such,</v>

1094
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:46.760
<v Speaker 2>we know too much about the phylogeny of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>

1095
01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:51.110
<v Speaker 2>We know where they fit into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>phylogeny of life on earth.</v>

1096
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:56.470
<v Speaker 2>And it can't really make the case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were extraterrestrial because there</v>

1097
01:00:57.741 --> 01:00:59.610
<v Speaker 2>were mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1098
01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:02.930
<v Speaker 2>their mushrooms and they're part of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1099
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:06.590
<v Speaker 2>they have a position in the well defined</v>
<v Speaker 2>phylogeny of fungi,</v>

1100
01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.650
<v Speaker 2>which are some of the most ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>organisms,</v>

1101
01:01:09.651 --> 01:01:14.651
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the most earliest macro or a </v>

1102
01:01:14.651 --> 01:01:17.210
<v Speaker 2>terrestrial organisms that were of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>macro scale.</v>

1103
01:01:17.211 --> 01:01:18.590
<v Speaker 2>We're fungi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1104
01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:23.591
<v Speaker 2>there were big fungi on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on interest rate environments before </v>

1105
01:01:23.591 --> 01:01:27.851
<v Speaker 2>there was much of anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't siliciden mushrooms </v>

1106
01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:32.290
<v Speaker 2>presumably have you paid attention to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this most recent theory that perhaps,</v>

1107
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:37.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ancestors of octopus might have </v>

1108
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:39.360
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another gotten here from an </v>
<v Speaker 2>asteroid that there,</v>

1109
01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:44.420
<v Speaker 2>there's something about their unique </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to alter their rna which is </v>

1110
01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:47.330
<v Speaker 2>unique in the animal kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have heard about that.</v>

1111
01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have a legit sources apparently.</v>

1112
01:01:50.601 --> 01:01:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a real legit sources,</v>

1113
01:01:53.181 --> 01:01:53.690
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>

1114
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:57.020
<v Speaker 2>I haven't read far enough into that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just decide.</v>

1115
01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if anything,</v>

1116
01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:00.920
<v Speaker 2>it seems like an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1117
01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they certainly look.</v>

1118
01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.240
<v Speaker 2>They look like our idea of an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1119
01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:10.340
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We probably looked like aliens to </v>

1120
01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:10.340
<v Speaker 2>octopus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1121
01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:10.340
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1122
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:11.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

1123
01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:15.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another interesting,</v>

1124
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.800
<v Speaker 2>maybe interesting angle on this was I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1125
01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:21.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1126
01:02:21.151 --> 01:02:26.151
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was invited to another private </v>

1127
01:02:26.151 --> 01:02:29.661
<v Speaker 2>conference actually at tiering ham and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the subject of the conference was dmt </v>

1128
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:33.400
<v Speaker 2>entities and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1129
01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:38.410
<v Speaker 2>are the entities you see on Dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they real or not tall order?</v>

1130
01:02:40.291 --> 01:02:44.790
<v Speaker 2>Very difficult to really unpack that for</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing.</v>

1131
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.820
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's start there.</v>

1132
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Anything you experienced is real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1133
01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:52.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so start there.</v>

1134
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:57.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the talk that I presented was called</v>

1135
01:02:57.061 --> 01:03:02.061
<v Speaker 2>a is dmt a messenger molecule from an </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraterrestrial civilization.</v>

1136
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:06.510
<v Speaker 2>That was the title of my talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually,</v>

1137
01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:12.350
<v Speaker 2>in the course of preparing the talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to conclude that probably not,</v>

1138
01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:18.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you're going to postulate </v>

1139
01:03:18.350 --> 01:03:18.930
<v Speaker 2>that what you really have to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>is uh,</v>

1140
01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:24.560
<v Speaker 2>the origin of tryptofan because </v>
<v Speaker 2>tryptofan the amino acid which is found </v>

1141
01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:29.601
<v Speaker 2>in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the 20 that goes into </v>

1142
01:03:29.601 --> 01:03:32.211
<v Speaker 2>protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tryptofan is the precursor to all these </v>

1143
01:03:32.211 --> 01:03:34.800
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic tryptamines and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also including Serotonin.</v>

1144
01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:40.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dmt is kind of the archetypal </v>

1145
01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've got silicide been siliciden </v>

1146
01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:44.490
<v Speaker 2>five methoxy before [inaudible] and even</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Beta carbon lanes.</v>

1147
01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:49.491
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you look back in Phylogeny,</v>

1148
01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:53.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1149
01:03:53.671 --> 01:03:56.760
<v Speaker 2>a billion years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of billion years,</v>

1150
01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:01.560
<v Speaker 2>eventually you're talking about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they call the trip opera,</v>

1151
01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:07.310
<v Speaker 2>which is the cluster of genes that give </v>
<v Speaker 2>rise to tryptofan.</v>

1152
01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:12.930
<v Speaker 2>So we pretty certain you're not talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about is dmt extraterrestrial in origin.</v>

1153
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:14.460
<v Speaker 2>You have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1154
01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:15.530
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1155
01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:20.560
<v Speaker 2>it came from tryptofan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how'd the trip on a arise in </v>

1156
01:04:21.001 --> 01:04:26.001
<v Speaker 2>phylogeny it was that extra terrestrial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's one of the most </v>

1157
01:04:26.001 --> 01:04:26.960
<v Speaker 2>ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1158
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:30.810
<v Speaker 2>gene clusters in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the evolution of life,</v>

1159
01:04:30.811 --> 01:04:34.530
<v Speaker 2>you can't really make the case that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraterrestrial because you could say,</v>

1160
01:04:34.531 --> 01:04:36.030
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it came from,</v>

1161
01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:41.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhodopsin actually the genes that the </v>

1162
01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:46.080
<v Speaker 2>trip opera opera on originated from </v>
<v Speaker 2>originally where the genes that the same</v>

1163
01:04:46.081 --> 01:04:51.081
<v Speaker 2>genes that code for Rhodopsin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the pigment in the eye that </v>

1164
01:04:51.081 --> 01:04:54.720
<v Speaker 2>responds to light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I ended up,</v>

1165
01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:59.250
<v Speaker 2>I could make the case that dmt is extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrestrial and,</v>

1166
01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:02.100
<v Speaker 2>but is that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been an interesting case.</v>

1167
01:05:02.101 --> 01:05:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Like whether or not it's from another </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet,</v>

1168
01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:05.220
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1169
01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:09.030
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem like it's here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The experience does it.</v>

1170
01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:11.180
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like it's here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1171
01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:13.680
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then again,</v>

1172
01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.620
<v Speaker 2>where is here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1173
01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:21.440
<v Speaker 2>eventually I defaulted to say it may not</v>
<v Speaker 2>be an extra terrestrial messenger </v>

1174
01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.430
<v Speaker 2>molecule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a messenger molecule and it is</v>

1175
01:05:24.431 --> 01:05:28.420
<v Speaker 2>a distinctly terrestrial messenger </v>
<v Speaker 2>molecule.</v>

1176
01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:33.420
<v Speaker 2>It is the messenger molecule that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been adopted by the community of species</v>

1177
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:40.030
<v Speaker 2>to talk to the monkeys and try to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1178
01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:44.260
<v Speaker 2>talk to our consciousness and maybe even</v>
<v Speaker 2>to trigger consciousness.</v>

1179
01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:49.590
<v Speaker 2>So dmt is only two steps from tryptofan </v>
<v Speaker 2>and somatically and cellular metabolism.</v>

1180
01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:57.830
<v Speaker 2>Tryptofan is universal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a living thing that we know of that </v>

1181
01:05:57.830 --> 01:06:02.311
<v Speaker 2>does not contain trip to fan because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the 20 that go into amino </v>

1182
01:06:02.311 --> 01:06:06.841
<v Speaker 2>acids to steps from Tryptofan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decarboxylation and,</v>

1183
01:06:07.181 --> 01:06:10.730
<v Speaker 2>and methylation is all it takes to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>dmt.</v>

1184
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:15.750
<v Speaker 2>And that's like the prototypal </v>
<v Speaker 2>tryptamine psychedelic and the enzymes </v>

1185
01:06:18.761 --> 01:06:23.740
<v Speaker 2>that catalyze those steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They may not be universal in organisms,</v>

1186
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:28.770
<v Speaker 2>but they're pretty darn near universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have all sorts of other </v>

1187
01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:31.000
<v Speaker 2>cellular housekeeping functions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1188
01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:35.170
<v Speaker 2>decarboxylated amino acids as something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that goes on in every cell,</v>

1189
01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:39.850
<v Speaker 2>sticking methyl groups on nitrogens is </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe less,</v>

1190
01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.910
<v Speaker 2>less common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still very common,</v>

1191
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:46.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enzymes that will move a methyl groups </v>

1192
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:50.230
<v Speaker 2>around in sales so you can make the case</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1193
01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:55.030
<v Speaker 2>and we know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dmt is extremely common in nature.</v>

1194
01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:58.690
<v Speaker 2>DMT is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said nature is drenched in Dmt,</v>

1195
01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:04.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the animal level to the plant </v>

1196
01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:04.200
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the fungal level.</v>

1197
01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:06.010
<v Speaker 2>You find these things everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1198
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:07.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1199
01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:08.830
<v Speaker 2>and people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1200
01:07:08.831 --> 01:07:13.060
<v Speaker 2>there's about a hundred and 50 species </v>
<v Speaker 2>of plants that contain dmt.</v>

1201
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:17.320
<v Speaker 2>That's only because we've only looked at</v>
<v Speaker 2>150 species of plants.</v>

1202
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:22.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at these large genera that </v>

1203
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.670
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>

1204
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:25.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous known for having tryptamines like</v>

1205
01:07:25.181 --> 01:07:28.960
<v Speaker 2>Acacias and my Moses and these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1206
01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:33.610
<v Speaker 2>we know of a few species that have dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's hundreds of species,</v>

1207
01:07:33.611 --> 01:07:36.370
<v Speaker 2>thousands of species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that nobody's looked.</v>

1208
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's going to fund this work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can reasonably say that you </v>

1209
01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:45.931
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are about 1400 species of Acacia </v>

1210
01:07:45.931 --> 01:07:50.260
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably 75 percent of them have dmt and</v>

1211
01:07:50.261 --> 01:07:53.020
<v Speaker 2>actually I would go to the next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

1212
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:57.910
<v Speaker 2>I would even claim without evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's never stopped me before,</v>

1213
01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:03.780
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's reasonable to suppose </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because dmt is so close to </v>

1214
01:08:04.091 --> 01:08:09.091
<v Speaker 2>mainstream metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably all plants have dmt to some </v>

1215
01:08:09.161 --> 01:08:11.740
<v Speaker 2>extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most don't have large,</v>

1216
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:15.650
<v Speaker 2>large levels of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have useful amounts of DMT,</v>

1217
01:08:15.651 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 2>but if you</v>

1218
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:21.100
<v Speaker 1>took with sufficient instruments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just started ranting randomly </v>

1219
01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:25.991
<v Speaker 1>sampling plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some analyzing for dmt with the Mass </v>

1220
01:08:25.991 --> 01:08:29.891
<v Speaker 1>Spec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll bet it would turn up in almost </v>

1221
01:08:29.891 --> 01:08:29.891
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is.</v>

1222
01:08:29.891 --> 01:08:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Which is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grass that's toxic to sheep because of </v>

1223
01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:34.780
<v Speaker 1>DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1224
01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.500
<v Speaker 1>That's the one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the DMT in it for whatever reason,</v>

1225
01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:42.320
<v Speaker 1>way it interacts with the sheeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>digestive system becomes poisoned the.</v>

1226
01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1227
01:08:43.971 --> 01:08:46.140
<v Speaker 1>not entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's got flares.</v>

1228
01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Grass has dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has five methoxy DMT,</v>

1229
01:08:51.190 --> 01:08:54.530
<v Speaker 1>other tryptamines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also has something called grameen,</v>

1230
01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:59.740
<v Speaker 1>which has a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like dmt with only one carbon on </v>

1231
01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.280
<v Speaker 1>the side chain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grameen is more or less toxic.</v>

1232
01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Graming shows up in a lot of grass </v>
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

1233
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.930
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the thing that causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's called Polaris staggers.</v>

1234
01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:14.080
<v Speaker 1>So if you just fed dmt a synthesized to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheep,</v>

1235
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:18.050
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hard to say.</v>

1236
01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Did they produce monoamine oxidase?</v>

1237
01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's done it to shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1238
01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:25.730
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do leopards or jaguars all mammals.</v>

1239
01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:30.760
<v Speaker 1>So when you see those jaguars eating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves and then tripping their balls </v>

1240
01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:31.130
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling around on their back,</v>

1241
01:09:31.131 --> 01:09:34.940
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is happening there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen those videos.</v>

1242
01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:36.950
<v Speaker 1>I've seen those videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1243
01:09:36.951 --> 01:09:40.960
<v Speaker 1>for one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were eating a banisteriopsis right?</v>

1244
01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Which is the source of the Mao </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibitors.</v>

1245
01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know what to make of that.</v>

1246
01:09:47.631 --> 01:09:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It certainly does seem like some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a catnip for them,</v>

1247
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:56.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and causes an altered state for Mao </v>

1248
01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:57.020
<v Speaker 1>inhibitors in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an of themselves.</v>

1249
01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:59.480
<v Speaker 1>They produce some sort of a psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

1250
01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>

1251
01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:05.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just from the Mao inhibition,</v>

1252
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:08.480
<v Speaker 1>but they often have other effects that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are psychoactive,</v>

1253
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:11.000
<v Speaker 1>like harm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harming Armenia is a good example.</v>

1254
01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:16.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to think that harming was </v>

1255
01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:18.940
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the Mao inhibitor and Iowasca that </v>

1256
01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:19.100
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do a whole lot beyond that.</v>

1257
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out now harming this,</v>

1258
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:26.960
<v Speaker 1>getting a second look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that the tar mean,</v>

1259
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:28.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1260
01:10:28.551 --> 01:10:33.551
<v Speaker 1>was discovered in [inaudible] about </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 10 years before Iowasca was ever </v>

1261
01:10:35.391 --> 01:10:40.391
<v Speaker 1>reported to science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So harming is one of these hoary old </v>

1262
01:10:40.391 --> 01:10:40.760
<v Speaker 1>alkaloids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to call it,</v>

1263
01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:46.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been known forever and now we're </v>

1264
01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:48.030
<v Speaker 1>just finding out it has all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting pharmacology.</v>

1265
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:51.680
<v Speaker 1>It's an Mao inhibitor for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More importantly,</v>

1266
01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:56.681
<v Speaker 1>it appears that it stimulates </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurogenesis and that's relevant to </v>

1267
01:10:56.681 --> 01:11:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's and brain development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even down syndrome.</v>

1268
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:05.770
<v Speaker 1>It is an inhibitor of this kinase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this regulatory protein called Dyr k </v>

1269
01:11:07.161 --> 01:11:12.161
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has got its fingers in lots of </v>

1270
01:11:12.161 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 1>different cellular pies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could pull it many different</v>

1271
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:18.720
<v Speaker 2>regulatory functions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And harming is a very potent,</v>

1272
01:11:18.721 --> 01:11:23.721
<v Speaker 2>very selective inhibitor of this kinase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's relates to this.</v>

1273
01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:29.580
<v Speaker 2>It actually stimulates nerve growth in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hippocampus.</v>

1274
01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.350
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1275
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're at and we're finding out that </v>

1276
01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:37.920
<v Speaker 2>there are a number of other receptors </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it interacts with,</v>

1277
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:40.170
<v Speaker 2>including Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dopamine,</v>

1278
01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:45.171
<v Speaker 2>transporters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even one called the imaginal iin </v>

1279
01:11:45.171 --> 01:11:46.140
<v Speaker 2>receptors that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1280
01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have undefined functions.</v>

1281
01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:53.580
<v Speaker 2>So like most natural molecules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a one trick pony,</v>

1282
01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:58.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>harming has a number of effects,</v>

1283
01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:03.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why taking Iowasca is a </v>

1284
01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:03.990
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1285
01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:09.080
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's not a pure dmt </v>

1286
01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.860
<v Speaker 2>experience because you've got a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>mixture of alkaloids that are,</v>

1287
01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:16.220
<v Speaker 2>that are contributing to that effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who were the researchers that when they </v>

1288
01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:20.661
<v Speaker 2>discovered harming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know what it was and they </v>

1289
01:12:20.661 --> 01:12:22.410
<v Speaker 2>tried to label it telepathy to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They realized that it was harming,</v>

1290
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:22.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1291
01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:23.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1292
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is part of the,</v>

1293
01:12:28.050 --> 01:12:31.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you may call the,</v>

1294
01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:31.670
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1295
01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:36.700
<v Speaker 2>the sad and sorted history of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Iowasca in a certain way because in </v>

1296
01:12:38.881 --> 01:12:43.881
<v Speaker 2>the early days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the twenties when people are looking </v>

1297
01:12:43.881 --> 01:12:47.580
<v Speaker 2>at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a number of independent groups.</v>

1298
01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:50.280
<v Speaker 2>We're working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were identified,</v>

1299
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:55.310
<v Speaker 2>they were isolated molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't aware of other people's </v>

1300
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:56.550
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they misnamed these things,</v>

1301
01:12:56.551 --> 01:12:57.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1302
01:12:57.630 --> 01:12:59.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you exactly.</v>

1303
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:05.390
<v Speaker 2>I think initially it was Lewis Lewis who</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered a harming and he called it </v>

1304
01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.840
<v Speaker 2>business history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it turned out,</v>

1305
01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:15.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another group years before had isolated </v>

1306
01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:18.021
<v Speaker 2>the same molecule from Ghanim hormonally</v>
<v Speaker 2>and telepathy was one of these </v>

1307
01:13:18.021 --> 01:13:19.230
<v Speaker 2>misnomers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1308
01:13:19.231 --> 01:13:20.520
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that came out.</v>

1309
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000
<v Speaker 2>The problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this was that back in the day </v>

1310
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.810
<v Speaker 2>people didn't collect voucher specimens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of this chemical work was done </v>

1311
01:13:29.971 --> 01:13:33.000
<v Speaker 2>without the benefit of or barium </v>
<v Speaker 2>specimens,</v>

1312
01:13:33.001 --> 01:13:38.001
<v Speaker 2>which now every everybody that wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do fido chemical work hopefully has the </v>

1313
01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:44.880
<v Speaker 2>good sense to collect specimens of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>original plant so that people can go </v>

1314
01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:50.121
<v Speaker 2>back and look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of this early work was reported </v>

1315
01:13:50.121 --> 01:13:54.080
<v Speaker 2>and there was no voucher specimens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>document the collection.</v>

1316
01:13:54.211 --> 01:13:57.900
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of it had to be dismissed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1317
01:13:57.950 --> 01:14:02.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can the Beta carbon chemistry of </v>

1318
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:06.880
<v Speaker 2>abs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three opsis didn't really get </v>

1319
01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:06.880
<v Speaker 2>well-defined until,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1320
01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:08.770
<v Speaker 2>some Chinese scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1321
01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 2>or at least they had Chinese name worked</v>
<v Speaker 2>on them</v>

1322
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:17.590
<v Speaker 1>and discovered harming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tetra hydro harming and the [inaudible] </v>

1323
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:21.540
<v Speaker 1>as the main alkaloids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could reference that to botanical </v>

1324
01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:24.040
<v Speaker 1>voucher specimens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they really should get the credit for</v>

1325
01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:27.190
<v Speaker 1>discovering it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once that was done,</v>

1326
01:14:27.191 --> 01:14:32.191
<v Speaker 1>then it was known and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other scientists had to acknowledge </v>

1327
01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:37.471
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did they describe it as telepathy </v>

1328
01:14:37.471 --> 01:14:40.291
<v Speaker 1>and that there was supposedly some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a story about some group telepathic </v>

1329
01:14:40.291 --> 01:14:42.220
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was just romantic.</v>

1330
01:14:42.221 --> 01:14:44.560
<v Speaker 1>This was just some story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1331
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:47.770
<v Speaker 1>out of the literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1332
01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1333
01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was rumored to be able to cause </v>

1334
01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:54.620
<v Speaker 1>telepathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this wasn't Iowasca.</v>

1335
01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:58.720
<v Speaker 1>They were only taking hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not clear.</v>

1336
01:14:58.721 --> 01:15:00.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not clear.</v>

1337
01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1338
01:15:01.241 --> 01:15:03.820
<v Speaker 1>they may have been taken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they may have been taking it,</v>

1339
01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:08.530
<v Speaker 1>but whether they were getting telepathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of doubt it when we know we could</v>

1340
01:15:08.531 --> 01:15:10.210
<v Speaker 1>get telepathy on Iowasca.</v>

1341
01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:13.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not so uncommon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens all the time.</v>

1342
01:15:13.211 --> 01:15:16.890
<v Speaker 1>People have group hallucinations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>group visions.</v>

1343
01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Has anybody ever bothered to </v>
<v Speaker 1>independently,</v>

1344
01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:24.250
<v Speaker 1>like sequester people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them into different rooms,</v>

1345
01:15:24.490 --> 01:15:29.490
<v Speaker 1>have them do Iowaska and then have them </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe a very similar experience are </v>

1346
01:15:30.011 --> 01:15:34.810
<v Speaker 1>almost identical experience to prove </v>
<v Speaker 1>that these telepath he experiences exist</v>

1347
01:15:35.290 --> 01:15:37.780
<v Speaker 1>or at least to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as I know,</v>

1348
01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:39.990
<v Speaker 1>that hasn't been the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1349
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.530
<v Speaker 1>because everybody wants to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

1350
01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:46.420
<v Speaker 1>I just see the dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's been done.</v>

1351
01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.870
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a worthy study because </v>
<v Speaker 1>if.</v>

1352
01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:54.910
<v Speaker 1>If I've heard from more than one person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact my friend Kyle Kingsbury and his</v>

1353
01:15:54.911 --> 01:15:59.911
<v Speaker 1>wife had an ios experience with a both a</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a visualization of their child and </v>

1354
01:16:01.811 --> 01:16:06.430
<v Speaker 1>then when they got back she was pregnant</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they wound up having this child from</v>

1355
01:16:06.431 --> 01:16:08.800
<v Speaker 1>their visualization from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1356
01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:13.980
<v Speaker 1>from this experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously they're very close and they </v>

1357
01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:18.691
<v Speaker 1>were together and they probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicated quite a bit and I would </v>

1358
01:16:18.691 --> 01:16:19.480
<v Speaker 1>just think it would be a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting experiment.</v>

1359
01:16:20.290 --> 01:16:22.390
<v Speaker 1>It would be very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1360
01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:28.030
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of points out there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>realm of experience,</v>

1361
01:16:28.031 --> 01:16:33.031
<v Speaker 1>a realm of knowing that these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>give access to that's normally close to </v>

1362
01:16:34.181 --> 01:16:34.600
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1363
01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:36.880
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a trivial statement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

1364
01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you get down to questions of </v>

1365
01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.840
<v Speaker 1>how verifiable is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how real is that?</v>

1366
01:16:43.841 --> 01:16:45.370
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1367
01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:46.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1368
01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:51.580
<v Speaker 1>and people get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the term is hung up,</v>

1369
01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:54.850
<v Speaker 1>but they can get baffled when you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

1370
01:16:56.650 --> 01:17:01.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality of say the entities you </v>

1371
01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:01.960
<v Speaker 1>encounter on dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is,</v>

1372
01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:06.970
<v Speaker 1>this is some people I know are obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with trying to verify the reality of the</v>

1373
01:17:08.021 --> 01:17:10.280
<v Speaker 1>entities that find on dmt.</v>

1374
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:17.070
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes down to if you experienced </v>

1375
01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:17.070
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're real.</v>

1376
01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:20.080
<v Speaker 2>If anything you experienced is real </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you've experienced it,</v>

1377
01:17:20.410 --> 01:17:25.410
<v Speaker 2>does it have a corresponding existence </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the external world?</v>

1378
01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1379
01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.000
<v Speaker 2>what's external?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's eating turtle?</v>

1380
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:31.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1381
01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:33.300
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we throw around these terms,</v>

1382
01:17:33.330 --> 01:17:36.930
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these epistomological metaphysical terms</v>

1383
01:17:37.410 --> 01:17:39.110
<v Speaker 2>quite carelessly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1384
01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:42.660
<v Speaker 2>without really thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean when you say,</v>

1385
01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:46.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm in here and you're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1386
01:17:46.291 --> 01:17:50.280
<v Speaker 2>and then you take a psychedelic and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that's an artificial boundary.</v>

1387
01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all one.</v>

1388
01:17:52.411 --> 01:17:57.411
<v Speaker 2>There is no separation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's separate in normal consciousness </v>

1389
01:17:57.411 --> 01:17:57.690
<v Speaker 2>though it's separated in normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious,</v>

1390
01:17:57.830 --> 01:18:02.220
<v Speaker 2>but then what is normal conscious if not</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reflection of year,</v>

1391
01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.860
<v Speaker 2>neurochemical brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

1392
01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean everything you experience is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>altered state because it's filtered into</v>

1393
01:18:09.291 --> 01:18:14.291
<v Speaker 2>this brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>processed by the brain and you know the </v>

1394
01:18:14.291 --> 01:18:16.940
<v Speaker 2>brain is a biochemical engine that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1395
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:19.400
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often were made out of drug,</v>

1396
01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:24.490
<v Speaker 3>so it seems that our normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is the best state to </v>

1397
01:18:24.490 --> 01:18:27.450
<v Speaker 3>propagate biological life and to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

1398
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:32.750
<v Speaker 3>our whatever we've created in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our community structures and </v>

1399
01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.800
<v Speaker 3>relationships and friendships and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to build structures and houses </v>

1400
01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.240
<v Speaker 3>and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>

1401
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:41.360
<v Speaker 3>all of these things are done best when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're here and present.</v>

1402
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Whereas when you're on a psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>state,</v>

1403
01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.320
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1404
01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:50.360
<v Speaker 3>the way I've always described it as if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you had a meeting with God and you went </v>

1405
01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:53.110
<v Speaker 3>and God gave you all the answers to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and you,</v>

1406
01:18:53.130 --> 01:18:58.130
<v Speaker 3>you experienced a undeniable beauty in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most extreme form possible where you</v>

1407
01:18:59.471 --> 01:19:04.471
<v Speaker 3>couldn't have imagined it and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>came back whether you hallucinated it or</v>

1408
01:19:04.511 --> 01:19:06.940
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the exact same experience.</v>

1409
01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:09.630
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't put it on a scale right away.</v>

1410
01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:14.640
<v Speaker 3>It was like we've stretched the tape </v>
<v Speaker 3>measure around and God is 47 inches </v>

1411
01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.000
<v Speaker 3>across.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like just because,</v>

1412
01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:21.210
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because you can't measure it with </v>

1413
01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:21.440
<v Speaker 3>what we term our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

1414
01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:22.260
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1415
01:19:22.261 --> 01:19:25.640
<v Speaker 3>our metrics for reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1416
01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:28.280
<v Speaker 3>And that is exactly the thing.</v>

1417
01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about whether it's real and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we would define real.</v>

1418
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:36.410
<v Speaker 2>Is it good information or is it bad or </v>
<v Speaker 2>is it not?</v>

1419
01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.920
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter where it comes from,</v>

1420
01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:43.960
<v Speaker 2>it's such a fits good information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it has its own internal validity of</v>

1421
01:19:44.691 --> 01:19:49.691
<v Speaker 2>whether it came from some part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself that is normally obscurity you </v>

1422
01:19:51.061 --> 01:19:51.330
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1423
01:19:51.331 --> 01:19:55.620
<v Speaker 2>came from the plant teacher or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens transmitting it through.</v>

1424
01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:01.320
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we we're obsessed with that reality </v>

1425
01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.100
<v Speaker 3>because we think we're being fooled a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>

1426
01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:08.400
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in this goes back to terrance's La </v>

1427
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:09.960
<v Speaker 3>Chorrera psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he had a Ufo encounter.</v>

1428
01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:10.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1429
01:20:10.841 --> 01:20:13.800
<v Speaker 3>the easily dismissing amongst us will </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1430
01:20:13.801 --> 01:20:18.801
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's tripping his balls off on </v>

1431
01:20:18.801 --> 01:20:18.801
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course I saw you was,</v>

1432
01:20:18.801 --> 01:20:20.910
<v Speaker 3>or a leprechaun drive in the UFO.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all that's nonsense,</v>

1433
01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:21.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1434
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Be Easy to dismiss as in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the nature of these phenomena.</v>

1435
01:20:28.311 --> 01:20:32.580
<v Speaker 2>That's what's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easy to dismiss that.</v>

1436
01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:35.940
<v Speaker 2>That was another aspect of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment of La Truro.</v>

1437
01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:38.170
<v Speaker 2>I left out when I was talking about my </v>
<v Speaker 2>lecture,</v>

1438
01:20:38.171 --> 01:20:43.171
<v Speaker 2>but there's almost always an element of </v>
<v Speaker 2>absurdity in these experiences and in </v>

1439
01:20:46.221 --> 01:20:49.030
<v Speaker 2>paranormal experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Ufo encounters.</v>

1440
01:20:49.031 --> 01:20:52.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like little green men bond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you kidding?</v>

1441
01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:57.890
<v Speaker 2>But the fuck there are little green man </v>
<v Speaker 2>and little blue man.</v>

1442
01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:01.470
<v Speaker 2>You know a guy who should have on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

1443
01:21:01.471 --> 01:21:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you have already a is Whitley </v>
<v Speaker 2>strieber?</v>

1444
01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:06.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had him on,</v>

1445
01:21:06.081 --> 01:21:10.640
<v Speaker 3>but he's so out to lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have massive reservations.</v>

1446
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:14.830
<v Speaker 3>There's a video of him looking at a fly </v>
<v Speaker 3>in fly.</v>

1447
01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:19.400
<v Speaker 3>Clearly a fly flies in front of a camera</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's describing it.</v>

1448
01:21:19.401 --> 01:21:24.401
<v Speaker 3>Is this a man in a suit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like there's something wrong </v>

1449
01:21:24.401 --> 01:21:24.401
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>

1450
01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I missed that.</v>

1451
01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:31.640
<v Speaker 2>I missed that part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what's interesting about </v>

1452
01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:31.640
<v Speaker 2>Whitley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I agree,</v>

1453
01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:33.450
<v Speaker 2>I totally dismissed him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1454
01:21:33.451 --> 01:21:35.040
<v Speaker 2>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

1455
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:37.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is really a nutcase.</v>

1456
01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:41.220
<v Speaker 3>He's from the communion books or people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't know exactly what a series of</v>

1457
01:21:41.221 --> 01:21:43.560
<v Speaker 3>books about being abducted and.</v>

1458
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:48.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I sort of had to change my opinion </v>

1459
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:52.880
<v Speaker 2>somewhat because he and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1460
01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Jeffrey cripple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I do know is Jeffrey Carpool is a </v>

1461
01:21:58.711 --> 01:22:03.711
<v Speaker 2>professor of comparative religion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythology at Rice university and his </v>

1462
01:22:04.471 --> 01:22:09.471
<v Speaker 2>focus initially as a sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the superhero,</v>

1463
01:22:09.541 --> 01:22:14.541
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as in contemporary mythology as a </v>

1464
01:22:14.911 --> 01:22:17.460
<v Speaker 2>mythical figure in that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>

1465
01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:21.330
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was invited to a,</v>

1466
01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:27.360
<v Speaker 2>a simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a workshop that Whitley was going to be </v>

1467
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:31.231
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a couple of years ago in </v>

1468
01:22:31.231 --> 01:22:34.021
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While I'm always interested in a free </v>

1469
01:22:34.021 --> 01:22:34.021
<v Speaker 2>trip to Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1470
01:22:34.021 --> 01:22:34.021
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1471
01:22:34.021 --> 01:22:35.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to come to this thing,</v>

1472
01:22:35.311 --> 01:22:40.311
<v Speaker 2>but this guy is a nut case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I want to appear on the </v>

1473
01:22:40.311 --> 01:22:41.860
<v Speaker 2>same stage with this guy and if it's me </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that,</v>

1474
01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:46.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1475
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:49.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the guy who was hosting it said,</v>

1476
01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:51.170
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1477
01:22:51.171 --> 01:22:54.250
<v Speaker 2>did you know that he and Jeffrey Carpal </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a book together?</v>

1478
01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.120
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1479
01:22:55.121 --> 01:22:55.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said that.</v>

1480
01:22:55.981 --> 01:22:58.920
<v Speaker 2>I know Jeffrey cripple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that he's not on that case.</v>

1481
01:22:58.921 --> 01:23:03.921
<v Speaker 2>And that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I found out about the book and </v>

1482
01:23:03.921 --> 01:23:04.370
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1483
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:08.710
<v Speaker 2>I told the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you invite Geoffrey and Whitley,</v>

1484
01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:13.740
<v Speaker 2>then all come and will participate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The name of the book is a supernatural </v>

1485
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:17.050
<v Speaker 2>two words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supernatural,</v>

1486
01:23:17.051 --> 01:23:22.051
<v Speaker 2>a new vision of the unexplained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really very interesting.</v>

1487
01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book is basically,</v>

1488
01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:30.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alternating chapters.</v>

1489
01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:35.220
<v Speaker 2>Whitley tells us stories about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to it and what has happened to </v>

1490
01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:39.541
<v Speaker 2>and what continues to happen to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lives in some kind of alternate </v>

1491
01:23:39.541 --> 01:23:39.541
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1492
01:23:39.541 --> 01:23:39.670
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>t,</v>

1493
01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:40.810
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1494
01:23:40.811 --> 01:23:42.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I accept it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I get it.</v>

1495
01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:47.970
<v Speaker 2>And then in alternating chapters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeffrey comes along and kind of unpacks </v>

1496
01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:51.390
<v Speaker 2>this and explained where does this fit </v>
<v Speaker 2>into sort of the,</v>

1497
01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:56.590
<v Speaker 2>the phenomenology of mythology and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1498
01:23:56.620 --> 01:24:01.620
<v Speaker 2>reasonable explanations and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a fascinating book.</v>

1499
01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:05.200
<v Speaker 2>If you just suspend disbelief for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute,</v>

1500
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:10.000
<v Speaker 2>think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assume that Whitley's is sincere.</v>

1501
01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:15.001
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that these things really </v>

1502
01:24:15.001 --> 01:24:18.211
<v Speaker 2>happened to him or he thinks they do and</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the most craziest things,</v>

1503
01:24:19.601 --> 01:24:20.700
<v Speaker 2>these are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1504
01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:25.300
<v Speaker 2>the media has made like everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they dumb it down,</v>

1505
01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:25.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

1506
01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:29.930
<v Speaker 2>they put it into the box of alien </v>
<v Speaker 2>encounters guys,</v>

1507
01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:31.800
<v Speaker 2>a nutball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1508
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:33.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they dismiss it.</v>

1509
01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:38.130
<v Speaker 2>But if you take a closer look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing to Whitley's credit is he </v>

1510
01:24:38.711 --> 01:24:40.870
<v Speaker 2>doesn't claim to understand what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

1511
01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:44.110
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't call it an alien encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't claim anything.</v>

1512
01:24:44.111 --> 01:24:49.111
<v Speaker 2>He just says this is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no frigging idea what is,</v>

1513
01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:53.400
<v Speaker 2>what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's honest,</v>

1514
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:55.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an honest scientific stance.</v>

1515
01:24:55.931 --> 01:25:00.931
<v Speaker 2>I do not understand this phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I gave him credit for that and then </v>

1516
01:25:00.931 --> 01:25:03.490
<v Speaker 2>he and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Jeffrey wrote this book.</v>

1517
01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:06.730
<v Speaker 2>There was a very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1518
01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:07.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>later on.</v>

1519
01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:12.960
<v Speaker 2>So I read all this later on in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a chapter where they get to what</v>

1520
01:25:13.391 --> 01:25:18.391
<v Speaker 2>is the possible physical explanation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on here.</v>

1521
01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:22.330
<v Speaker 2>If there is a physical explanation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the headings,</v>

1522
01:25:22.331 --> 01:25:27.331
<v Speaker 2>I think the chapter one of the headings </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the chapter was labeled the soul as </v>

1523
01:25:27.371 --> 01:25:31.600
<v Speaker 2>a Ufo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of blew my mind.</v>

1524
01:25:31.601 --> 01:25:34.840
<v Speaker 2>That got my attention because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1525
01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:40.380
<v Speaker 2>when I did this workshop with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of bringing the flag of </v>

1526
01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1527
01:25:41.050 --> 01:25:43.450
<v Speaker 2>That was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't aggress psychedelics,</v>

1528
01:25:43.451 --> 01:25:46.060
<v Speaker 2>you've only got part of the picture </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1529
01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:48.190
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

1530
01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:50.320
<v Speaker 2>and they were talking about how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>soul,</v>

1531
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:56.910
<v Speaker 2>how this could be some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical plaza moist type of thing.</v>

1532
01:25:57.071 --> 01:25:59.830
<v Speaker 2>They were invoking scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>terminology.</v>

1533
01:25:59.831 --> 01:26:02.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was legitimate or not,</v>

1534
01:26:02.890 --> 01:26:05.450
<v Speaker 2>but just the idea of the soul of a Ufo.</v>

1535
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:07.850
<v Speaker 2>And I was able to respond to that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1536
01:26:07.851 --> 01:26:08.730
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1537
01:26:08.970 --> 01:26:13.970
<v Speaker 2>the experiment at launch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>earl was essentially the blueprints of </v>

1538
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:16.710
<v Speaker 2>how to build one of these things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking to,</v>

1539
01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:21.510
<v Speaker 2>which it was really this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this transformation.</v>

1540
01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:25.500
<v Speaker 2>And so that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that impressed me.</v>

1541
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:29.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to make of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1542
01:26:29.190 --> 01:26:31.950
<v Speaker 2>I think there is and they don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

1543
01:26:32.130 --> 01:26:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows what to make of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there just odd things going </v>

1544
01:26:37.130 --> 01:26:38.380
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1545
01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:44.380
<v Speaker 2>but that some people experience yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1546
01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:50.060
<v Speaker 2>and whether they are actual encounters </v>
<v Speaker 2>or dreams or somewhere in between.</v>

1547
01:26:53.230 --> 01:26:56.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be cool.</v>

1548
01:26:56.150 --> 01:26:57.890
<v Speaker 2>It would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1549
01:26:58.570 --> 01:26:59.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1550
01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:00.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

1551
01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:02.410
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you meet Whitley,</v>

1552
01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:04.660
<v Speaker 2>have you ever met him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1553
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:10.590
<v Speaker 2>he is like the most drab person you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could imagine.</v>

1554
01:27:10.631 --> 01:27:12.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's like an accountant or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something</v>

1555
01:27:12.490 --> 01:27:14.260
<v Speaker 3>probably worn out from telling all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

1556
01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be.</v>

1557
01:27:16.511 --> 01:27:19.120
<v Speaker 3>But he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was a fiction writer.</v>

1558
01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:24.390
<v Speaker 3>He was a fiction writer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he comes out with this </v>

1559
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:27.810
<v Speaker 3>incredible real world story reads like </v>
<v Speaker 3>fiction and I.</v>

1560
01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:32.820
<v Speaker 3>There's obviously something off when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to him or you hear him and I've </v>

1561
01:27:32.921 --> 01:27:37.921
<v Speaker 3>never talked to him personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you see him in interviews and </v>

1562
01:27:37.921 --> 01:27:39.040
<v Speaker 3>conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something off now.</v>

1563
01:27:39.041 --> 01:27:41.860
<v Speaker 3>What is that something off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a psychotic break?</v>

1564
01:27:41.861 --> 01:27:44.370
<v Speaker 3>Is it something that drifts in and out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does he,</v>

1565
01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:47.260
<v Speaker 3>is he having problems with normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness?</v>

1566
01:27:47.650 --> 01:27:48.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1567
01:27:48.170 --> 01:27:50.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought I'm really,</v>

1568
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.800
<v Speaker 3>if you can find that video of him </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about the fly.</v>

1569
01:27:54.670 --> 01:27:59.040
<v Speaker 3>Did you find it flies a man in a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>space suit.</v>

1570
01:27:59.050 --> 01:28:00.640
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a man in a suit.</v>

1571
01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.480
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1572
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:06.510
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To the lunch called the Ben with quite a</v>

1573
01:28:07.390 --> 01:28:12.390
<v Speaker 3>few of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's quite a few really bizarre </v>

1574
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:14.170
<v Speaker 3>videos of him when he's having a hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>time with normal reality.</v>

1575
01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:19.380
<v Speaker 3>So which would make sense during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dream state because all of these things </v>

1576
01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:19.380
<v Speaker 3>are happening at night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1577
01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:20.090
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1578
01:28:20.230 --> 01:28:23.170
<v Speaker 3>This was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the big thing that I've always.</v>

1579
01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:26.650
<v Speaker 3>Big Problem I've always had about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFO abduction experiences.</v>

1580
01:28:26.651 --> 01:28:31.651
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all take place when someone is </v>

1581
01:28:31.651 --> 01:28:34.510
<v Speaker 3>either a at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's either they're on a dark road where</v>

1582
01:28:34.511 --> 01:28:39.511
<v Speaker 3>there's no one around and they're sleepy</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they're at home and their bed like </v>

1583
01:28:39.511 --> 01:28:42.790
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority of them take place at </v>
<v Speaker 3>night or while someone's lying in bed,</v>

1584
01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:48.060
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly when you're dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we don't totally understand the </v>

1585
01:28:48.131 --> 01:28:50.350
<v Speaker 3>dream state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we there's,</v>

1586
01:28:50.770 --> 01:28:55.770
<v Speaker 3>there's a connection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least an implied connection between </v>

1587
01:28:55.770 --> 01:28:58.981
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic chemicals that your brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>produces endogenously that could be </v>

1588
01:28:58.981 --> 01:29:01.350
<v Speaker 3>released during the dream state and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>different levels with different humans.</v>

1589
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:06.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously some people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems with producing serotonin and </v>

1590
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:09.300
<v Speaker 3>dopamine and then other people have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems with it and this biology of the</v>

1591
01:29:09.301 --> 01:29:10.890
<v Speaker 3>human brain varies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1592
01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:16.340
<v Speaker 3>So it's not without consider it or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>without possibility that there's someone</v>

1593
01:29:17.761 --> 01:29:22.761
<v Speaker 3>who has a real issue with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemicals just bust in through right </v>

1594
01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.170
<v Speaker 3>flooding there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we,</v>

1595
01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:26.100
<v Speaker 3>oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1596
01:29:26.101 --> 01:29:29.030
<v Speaker 3>there aren't people then does this </v>
<v Speaker 3>mental illness,</v>

1597
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:34.910
<v Speaker 3>but then does this contradict what we've</v>
<v Speaker 3>already said about psychedelic </v>

1598
01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:38.121
<v Speaker 3>experiences?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why would we diminish his </v>

1599
01:29:38.121 --> 01:29:38.760
<v Speaker 3>indogenous psychedelic experience if </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what he's having.</v>

1600
01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:44.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is entirely possible that you're </v>

1601
01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:44.060
<v Speaker 3>dealing with someone who maybe perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 3>does have some sort of psychotic breaks,</v>

1602
01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:49.250
<v Speaker 3>but also is experiencing psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences due to some endogenous DMT </v>

1603
01:29:49.711 --> 01:29:53.190
<v Speaker 3>dump or dump of whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all these things are taking place at</v>

1604
01:29:53.191 --> 01:29:56.460
<v Speaker 3>the same time in the dream state during </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy rem sleep.</v>

1605
01:29:56.700 --> 01:30:00.870
<v Speaker 3>And he's coming back with these uniform </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories of alien abduction.</v>

1606
01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:02.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1607
01:30:02.431 --> 01:30:03.270
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1608
01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:05.970
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's hard to</v>

1609
01:30:06.490 --> 01:30:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Parse it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I accept it all,</v>

1610
01:30:10.301 --> 01:30:12.550
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to dismiss,</v>

1611
01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:16.300
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you shouldn't write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there may be something there.</v>

1612
01:30:16.301 --> 01:30:21.301
<v Speaker 1>We should approach it in the spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a phenomenon.</v>

1613
01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:25.290
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand that we shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismiss it.</v>

1614
01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:29.670
<v Speaker 1>There's something to be understood here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily his understanding of it,</v>

1615
01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:35.030
<v Speaker 1>but something to be looked at there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought this book was interesting </v>

1616
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.820
<v Speaker 1>for its balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1617
01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:40.490
<v Speaker 1>I would not have Whitley strieber on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your show without Jeffrey cry a lot.</v>

1618
01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.930
<v Speaker 1>So that was the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause he,</v>

1619
01:30:42.931 --> 01:30:43.800
<v Speaker 1>it would be fun</v>

1620
01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:46.540
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1621
01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a bridge too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

1622
01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that maybe we get to the bottom of</v>

1623
01:30:52.511 --> 01:30:53.410
<v Speaker 1>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1624
01:30:53.710 --> 01:30:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there something to be got to the </v>

1625
01:30:58.710 --> 01:30:58.710
<v Speaker 1>bottom right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1626
01:30:58.710 --> 01:31:02.330
<v Speaker 1>that's the bottom of this is just one </v>
<v Speaker 1>man's delusion or is there really </v>

1627
01:31:02.471 --> 01:31:03.820
<v Speaker 1>something that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The base of it,</v>

1628
01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:09.140
<v Speaker 1>and this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of the point that we were </v>

1629
01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:13.111
<v Speaker 1>talking about a while back and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation about natural philosophy,</v>

1630
01:31:13.710 --> 01:31:18.420
<v Speaker 1>natural philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1631
01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:22.800
<v Speaker 1>it has a wider scope for understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can say,</v>

1632
01:31:22.801 --> 01:31:27.801
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you meaning natural philosophy will </v>

1633
01:31:27.801 --> 01:31:29.160
<v Speaker 1>accept every Kaka may mean woo idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever came along.</v>

1634
01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Not Properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1635
01:31:31.501 --> 01:31:34.650
<v Speaker 1>it's natural philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Properly approached,</v>

1636
01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:40.010
<v Speaker 1>should be a way to evaluate these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigorously,</v>

1637
01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:42.390
<v Speaker 1>not abandoned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigorous thought,</v>

1638
01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:47.420
<v Speaker 1>but not be so dismissive of it as to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't fit into our paradigm.</v>

1639
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:49.800
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't fit into what we think we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1640
01:31:49.801 --> 01:31:53.040
<v Speaker 1>So we're not going to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's dishonest.</v>

1641
01:31:53.041 --> 01:31:56.030
<v Speaker 1>That's intellectual dishonesty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1642
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:58.530
<v Speaker 1>we have too much of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1643
01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:05.110
<v Speaker 1>sciences are very timid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of activity sometimes because </v>

1644
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:11.450
<v Speaker 1>in its current,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in its current incarnation,</v>

1645
01:32:11.451 --> 01:32:12.800
<v Speaker 1>it's so depend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1646
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:17.830
<v Speaker 1>it's corrupted in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just be the curious monkey </v>

1647
01:32:18.170 --> 01:32:21.410
<v Speaker 1>who's trying to apply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1648
01:32:22.110 --> 01:32:27.110
<v Speaker 1>clear thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigorous thought to understanding </v>

1649
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.110
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have that.</v>

1650
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Luxury scientists don't have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>luxury.</v>

1651
01:32:28.471 --> 01:32:31.350
<v Speaker 1>If they're practicing scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be getting grants,</v>

1652
01:32:31.351 --> 01:32:34.080
<v Speaker 1>you have to play the science game.</v>

1653
01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:36.850
<v Speaker 3>So that's what he keeps saying sciences </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupted.</v>

1654
01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:38.860
<v Speaker 3>That's what you mean by that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to get grants.</v>

1655
01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Not that they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of it.</v>

1656
01:32:41.630 --> 01:32:43.610
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to get grants and they have to</v>

1657
01:32:43.611 --> 01:32:45.410
<v Speaker 1>be dishonest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1658
01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:48.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean with themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with what they know,</v>

1659
01:32:48.141 --> 01:32:53.141
<v Speaker 1>like the example of the archeologists or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychedelic researchers back in the </v>

1660
01:32:53.141 --> 01:32:55.970
<v Speaker 1>80.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to kill your career,</v>

1661
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:59.150
<v Speaker 1>tell your supervisor that you wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work on psychedelics.</v>

1662
01:32:59.151 --> 01:33:04.151
<v Speaker 1>You were pretty much done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if you were an archeologist and you </v>

1663
01:33:04.151 --> 01:33:04.151
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1664
01:33:04.151 --> 01:33:04.610
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1665
01:33:04.611 --> 01:33:09.611
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all this evidence for ancient </v>

1666
01:33:09.611 --> 01:33:12.671
<v Speaker 1>civilizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want to be in this </v>

1667
01:33:12.671 --> 01:33:12.671
<v Speaker 1>department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

1668
01:33:12.671 --> 01:33:13.730
<v Speaker 1>you're outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you start talking about that.</v>

1669
01:33:14.150 --> 01:33:18.800
<v Speaker 1>So science is dogma in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not always,</v>

1670
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:24.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's unfortunate that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to save people's careers,</v>

1671
01:33:27.151 --> 01:33:31.520
<v Speaker 1>in order to have a career in science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to make the sacrifice.</v>

1672
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:36.550
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to keep to yourself things you </v>

1673
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:40.851
<v Speaker 1>know to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that you can't really talk </v>

1674
01:33:40.851 --> 01:33:43.410
<v Speaker 1>about because your colleagues will look </v>
<v Speaker 1>askance at you and sciences.</v>

1675
01:33:43.411 --> 01:33:46.530
<v Speaker 1>A very medieval institution in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect.</v>

1676
01:33:46.531 --> 01:33:49.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot like religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1677
01:33:49.710 --> 01:33:54.710
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the DMT experience and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at its effect on the human </v>

1678
01:33:54.710 --> 01:33:57.030
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much have you subscribes to.</v>

1679
01:33:57.031 --> 01:33:59.970
<v Speaker 1>The idea that we're looking at is some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a chemical gateway,</v>

1680
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:06.300
<v Speaker 3>chemical gateway to what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is to whatever that dmt </v>

1681
01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:10.210
<v Speaker 3>experiences that this is something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain has the ability to travel to.</v>

1682
01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:14.170
<v Speaker 3>But I mean when we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since we know that the body does produce</v>

1683
01:34:14.171 --> 01:34:19.171
<v Speaker 3>this and we know that possible for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to.</v>

1684
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:22.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've never done it,</v>

1685
01:34:22.321 --> 01:34:27.321
<v Speaker 3>but I know that people who do Kundalini </v>
<v Speaker 3>Yoga have apparently reported trip,</v>

1686
01:34:27.411 --> 01:34:30.740
<v Speaker 3>like experiences that are very similar </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a real dmt flash.</v>

1687
01:34:31.190 --> 01:34:33.710
<v Speaker 3>So the mind has this ability to do this </v>
<v Speaker 3>on its own.</v>

1688
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:37.640
<v Speaker 3>What do you think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that something worth considering that</v>

1689
01:34:37.641 --> 01:34:42.641
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is some sort of a pathway to a </v>

1690
01:34:42.641 --> 01:34:44.390
<v Speaker 3>nearby dimension or the to something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's around us all the time,</v>

1691
01:34:44.391 --> 01:34:47.660
<v Speaker 3>but we just don't have access to with </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal neurochemistry</v>

1692
01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:51.670
<v Speaker 1>all there are too many what ifs or who </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows?</v>

1693
01:34:51.671 --> 01:34:52.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1694
01:34:53.230 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 1>there's so much in what you said where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to go</v>

1695
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:03.010
<v Speaker 2>back and unpack all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we got excited about dmt terence </v>

1696
01:35:05.210 --> 01:35:07.550
<v Speaker 2>than me in the early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the late sixties,</v>

1697
01:35:07.551 --> 01:35:12.551
<v Speaker 2>what led is to go to La Chorrera was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it seemed like a completely </v>

1698
01:35:13.851 --> 01:35:17.900
<v Speaker 2>different order of magnitude than any of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other psychedelics.</v>

1699
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:23.410
<v Speaker 2>And we came to it really from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood that was steeped in science </v>

1700
01:35:23.410 --> 01:35:24.530
<v Speaker 2>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we carried with the,</v>

1701
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:29.770
<v Speaker 2>with us the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this really is another dimension and it </v>

1702
01:35:30.051 --> 01:35:34.520
<v Speaker 2>may be a portal to another dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as science fiction nuts,</v>

1703
01:35:34.730 --> 01:35:37.550
<v Speaker 2>we were totally okay with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1704
01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:40.940
<v Speaker 2>And we thought maybe DMT was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it is,</v>

1705
01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:46.360
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it's somehow pulls the curtain back </v>

1706
01:35:46.701 --> 01:35:50.180
<v Speaker 2>on something that's around us all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time that we don't see.</v>

1707
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

1708
01:35:52.211 --> 01:35:57.211
<v Speaker 2>in thinking about these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it something that is entirely within </v>

1709
01:35:57.211 --> 01:35:59.630
<v Speaker 2>the brain that it originates?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is it something that,</v>

1710
01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:04.800
<v Speaker 2>is it like a lens that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or our eyes are covered with,</v>

1711
01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:06.430
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1712
01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:10.100
<v Speaker 2>with filters and DMT temporarily removes</v>
<v Speaker 2>those filters?</v>

1713
01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:12.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it's hard to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1714
01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:16.220
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe experimentally we could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could begin to approach this.</v>

1715
01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:18.320
<v Speaker 2>Have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1716
01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:20.300
<v Speaker 2>am I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we really know.</v>

1717
01:36:20.301 --> 01:36:23.900
<v Speaker 2>I think that's another thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural philosophy,</v>

1718
01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:29.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's important that science is </v>

1719
01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:33.551
<v Speaker 2>overlooking and natural philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>always remembers the limits of what is </v>

1720
01:36:34.581 --> 01:36:35.510
<v Speaker 2>known,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1721
01:36:35.511 --> 01:36:39.140
<v Speaker 2>and sciences a bit arrogant about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they think is known.</v>

1722
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:41.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they only have,</v>

1723
01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:45.230
<v Speaker 2>science only understands a small </v>
<v Speaker 2>fraction of all there is to know.</v>

1724
01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:50.780
<v Speaker 2>And Iowasca another psychedelic always </v>
<v Speaker 2>remind me of this when I take it.</v>

1725
01:36:51.050 --> 01:36:55.640
<v Speaker 2>Remember the limitations of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge or sometimes it's more or less</v>

1726
01:36:55.641 --> 01:36:58.010
<v Speaker 2>kindly says it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know shit.</v>

1727
01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:00.820
<v Speaker 2>And it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

1728
01:37:01.330 --> 01:37:03.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and scientists can forget that,</v>

1729
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:07.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as far as this dmt a thing,</v>

1730
01:37:08.890 --> 01:37:10.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actually a,</v>

1731
01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:13.670
<v Speaker 2>there's controversy about this because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1732
01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:16.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1733
01:37:16.970 --> 01:37:21.970
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people who have worked in this </v>

1734
01:37:21.970 --> 01:37:25.661
<v Speaker 2>area say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty well established that </v>

1735
01:37:25.661 --> 01:37:28.180
<v Speaker 2>endogenous dmt can produce these states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the neil can secrete dmt under </v>

1736
01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:35.711
<v Speaker 2>certain circumstances or under stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lungs can produce large amounts of </v>

1737
01:37:35.711 --> 01:37:39.570
<v Speaker 2>dmt that are translocated to the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1738
01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:44.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's not so clear that that goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1739
01:37:44.121 --> 01:37:47.540
<v Speaker 2>it's clear that it can be produced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But David Nichols,</v>

1740
01:37:48.170 --> 01:37:53.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows a thing or two about </v>

1741
01:37:53.170 --> 01:37:54.770
<v Speaker 2>pharmacology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>founder of the heffter institute worlds,</v>

1742
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1743
01:37:56.010 --> 01:38:01.010
<v Speaker 1>most authoritative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highest authority when it comes to the </v>

1744
01:38:01.591 --> 01:38:04.590
<v Speaker 1>chemistry and pharmacology of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of psychedelics.</v>

1745
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:10.430
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's taken the reductionist argument on </v>

1746
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:11.940
<v Speaker 1>this that's kind of hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1747
01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:17.660
<v Speaker 1>to knock down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that DMT is produced </v>

1748
01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:21.621
<v Speaker 1>endogenously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's chopped up so quickly that it </v>

1749
01:38:21.621 --> 01:38:26.241
<v Speaker 1>never reaches the site of action and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>never reaches the levels at the neuron </v>

1750
01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:30.720
<v Speaker 1>that it would take to activate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurons.</v>

1751
01:38:31.370 --> 01:38:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1752
01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:37.490
<v Speaker 1>so we only consumed or are you saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>endogenously produced the endogenously </v>

1753
01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.380
<v Speaker 1>so that it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you consume it,</v>

1754
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:45.470
<v Speaker 1>obviously you flood the system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get much higher levels than has </v>

1755
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:49.941
<v Speaker 1>ever produced endogenously and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we haven't really measured the </v>

1756
01:38:49.941 --> 01:38:53.220
<v Speaker 1>levels produced endogenously during,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially these extreme states.</v>

1757
01:38:53.221 --> 01:38:55.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem.</v>

1758
01:38:55.801 --> 01:38:57.510
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you done,</v>

1759
01:38:57.511 --> 01:38:58.830
<v Speaker 1>do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1760
01:38:58.831 --> 01:39:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Have you done Kundalini and tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreate?</v>

1761
01:39:02.130 --> 01:39:03.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't either.</v>

1762
01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I've met terrence had that fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>

1763
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a talk about that this monk had a</v>

1764
01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:13.560
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city of levitation.</v>

1765
01:39:13.561 --> 01:39:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember this one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1766
01:39:15.291 --> 01:39:20.291
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Buddha came to town and he said for </v>

1767
01:39:20.291 --> 01:39:21.810
<v Speaker 1>the last 20 years I've practiced the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city of levitation and I can now walk on</v>

1768
01:39:21.811 --> 01:39:23.280
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Buddhist said,</v>

1769
01:39:23.281 --> 01:39:25.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ferries only a nickel.</v>

1770
01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:32.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want to practice Kundalini</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 10 years and Bang your head towards </v>

1771
01:39:33.151 --> 01:39:38.151
<v Speaker 1>the east or just smoked dmt and 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds later I run a center of the </v>

1772
01:39:38.431 --> 01:39:43.431
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think the last time I was on your </v>

1773
01:39:43.431 --> 01:39:43.431
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about this,</v>

1774
01:39:43.431 --> 01:39:43.431
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this other thing,</v>

1775
01:39:43.431 --> 01:39:46.320
<v Speaker 1>this agile light we discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1776
01:39:46.650 --> 01:39:48.900
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if you've interviewed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1777
01:39:48.901 --> 01:39:50.690
<v Speaker 1>we have to buy you one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said we were,</v>

1778
01:39:50.730 --> 01:39:53.520
<v Speaker 1>we totally dropped the ball on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to buy.</v>

1779
01:39:53.550 --> 01:39:58.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do have to buy you want by yourself </v>

1780
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.620
<v Speaker 1>while I'm going to buy myself one menu </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this time we're going to do it.</v>

1781
01:39:58.650 --> 01:40:00.960
<v Speaker 1>We said we're going to do too many </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>

1782
01:40:00.961 --> 01:40:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I forget everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I,</v>

1783
01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:07.710
<v Speaker 1>I've never bought that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agilent is interesting because,</v>

1784
01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:13.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he claims and that was the </v>

1785
01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:13.580
<v Speaker 1>conversation we had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He claimed,</v>

1786
01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:18.471
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stimulates and dodges synthesis of </v>

1787
01:40:18.471 --> 01:40:19.900
<v Speaker 1>writing this down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now it's a j.</v>

1788
01:40:19.930 --> 01:40:24.450
<v Speaker 1>A n a homage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no light.</v>

1789
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:28.620
<v Speaker 1>And his website is just [inaudible] dot </v>
<v Speaker 1>com.</v>

1790
01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:34.800
<v Speaker 1>And there's some good pdfs on there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll explain what this is about.</v>

1791
01:40:34.990 --> 01:40:36.060
<v Speaker 1>That Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1792
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:40.470
<v Speaker 1>And a big time because I just mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1793
01:40:43.090 --> 01:40:48.090
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this light can produce some sort of </v>

1794
01:40:48.090 --> 01:40:48.180
<v Speaker 1>psych,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no experience.</v>

1795
01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:51.810
<v Speaker 1>He claims it stimulates dmt synthesis in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pineal.</v>

1796
01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:55.870
<v Speaker 1>When you lie underneath that assist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of it's,</v>

1797
01:40:55.871 --> 01:40:57.560
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a floor lamp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1798
01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:02.590
<v Speaker 1>with a rectangular mount bunch of leds </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath it,</v>

1799
01:41:02.591 --> 01:41:05.530
<v Speaker 1>which he programs with an ipad and </v>
<v Speaker 1>different patterns.</v>

1800
01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:10.860
<v Speaker 1>You lie under it and you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stimulates hypnagogic hallucinations </v>

1801
01:41:10.890 --> 01:41:14.820
<v Speaker 1>that are a lot like that guy looks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>an old school freak looking at him.</v>

1802
01:41:15.610 --> 01:41:18.010
<v Speaker 1>He's a zen monk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet he is.</v>

1803
01:41:18.490 --> 01:41:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Amongst other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to be an apple engineer.</v>

1804
01:41:21.011 --> 01:41:25.900
<v Speaker 1>He was jobs right hand man when wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went the right way.</v>

1805
01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:28.360
<v Speaker 1>He went the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's got this thing.</v>

1806
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Is that cord going down to her head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard time seeing what's happening.</v>

1807
01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Something's wrapped around her head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That better not be a crystal.</v>

1808
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I think that running out of this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1809
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I think that's deceptive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't attach anything to me.</v>

1810
01:41:41.890 --> 01:41:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Perspective Issue Court binder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you lie under this thing.</v>

1811
01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:50.950
<v Speaker 1>And first time I lived under it I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought I got all these colors.</v>

1812
01:41:50.951 --> 01:41:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I got all these hypnagogic effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1813
01:41:53.651 --> 01:41:58.651
<v Speaker 1>and nice patterns and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a sub threshold DMT experience.</v>

1814
01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:00.730
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1815
01:42:00.850 --> 01:42:01.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1816
01:42:01.691 --> 01:42:05.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leds are all changing color,</v>

1817
01:42:05.021 --> 01:42:06.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how I see it.</v>

1818
01:42:06.161 --> 01:42:06.640
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1819
01:42:06.641 --> 01:42:08.980
<v Speaker 1>they're white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The colors are coming from you.</v>

1820
01:42:09.130 --> 01:42:11.980
<v Speaker 1>You're supplying the colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1821
01:42:11.981 --> 01:42:14.530
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was interesting.</v>

1822
01:42:14.531 --> 01:42:19.330
<v Speaker 1>And then we got into the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know this is stimulating dmt?</v>

1823
01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.040
<v Speaker 1>How do you know that's the effect?</v>

1824
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:25.120
<v Speaker 1>It turns out it's not so easy to nail </v>
<v Speaker 1>that down,</v>

1825
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:31.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the empty is sore femoral and </v>

1826
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:33.820
<v Speaker 1>the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't take urine samples or cerebral</v>

1827
01:42:33.821 --> 01:42:38.380
<v Speaker 1>spinal fluid or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be gone by the time you did it.</v>

1828
01:42:38.410 --> 01:42:42.370
<v Speaker 1>So the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe not the only way,</v>

1829
01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:45.870
<v Speaker 1>but one way you could do it is you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something called a,</v>

1830
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:50.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially you couldn't do this to</v>

1831
01:42:50.471 --> 01:42:51.670
<v Speaker 1>a human [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't,</v>

1832
01:42:51.730 --> 01:42:56.730
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't get an FDA approval for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could put a micro capillary tube</v>

1833
01:42:57.281 --> 01:43:02.281
<v Speaker 1>right next to the pineal that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>absorb things as they are released.</v>

1834
01:43:03.131 --> 01:43:05.830
<v Speaker 1>And then you could recover that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1835
01:43:05.831 --> 01:43:09.550
<v Speaker 1>levels of DMT or why couldn't you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to a voluntary participant?</v>

1836
01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Voluntary or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be screwing their brain up.</v>

1837
01:43:14.290 --> 01:43:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1838
01:43:15.191 --> 01:43:20.191
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'd have a hard time getting </v>

1839
01:43:20.191 --> 01:43:20.191
<v Speaker 1>permission.</v>

1840
01:43:20.191 --> 01:43:20.740
<v Speaker 1>There might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do it to a rat though.</v>

1841
01:43:21.130 --> 01:43:26.130
<v Speaker 1>You could do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what cottonwood research </v>

1842
01:43:26.130 --> 01:43:26.130
<v Speaker 1>foundation's done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1843
01:43:26.130 --> 01:43:30.000
<v Speaker 1>They've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they discovered dmt and the </v>

1844
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:30.000
<v Speaker 1>pineal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1845
01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:31.230
<v Speaker 1>to a live rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1846
01:43:31.370 --> 01:43:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they discovered it.</v>

1847
01:43:33.310 --> 01:43:35.200
<v Speaker 1>That was the first proof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1848
01:43:35.770 --> 01:43:38.620
<v Speaker 1>That was the first proof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick Cozy,</v>

1849
01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:43.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a pharmacologists at the </v>

1850
01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:45.610
<v Speaker 1>University of Wisconsin at Madison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was really the first one to show that</v>

1851
01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:50.640
<v Speaker 1>DMT is endogenously produced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sigma one agonist as well as a </v>

1852
01:43:52.461 --> 01:43:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin agonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another,</v>

1853
01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:57.900
<v Speaker 1>another receptor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1854
01:43:58.350 --> 01:44:03.020
<v Speaker 1>the definitely that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not clear what the function is.</v>

1855
01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:06.440
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a complicated issue,</v>

1856
01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:07.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1857
01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:12.940
<v Speaker 1>to figure this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll send you a paper that Nicole's </v>

1858
01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:16.290
<v Speaker 1>rotor elite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll link you to a video where he </v>

1859
01:44:16.290 --> 01:44:16.290
<v Speaker 1>discusses this and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1860
01:44:16.290 --> 01:44:21.250
<v Speaker 1>he gave that at the breaking convention </v>
<v Speaker 1>conference last summer that I was at and</v>

1861
01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:23.500
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1862
01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:26.290
<v Speaker 1>he was like the big Downer of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conference,</v>

1863
01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:26.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1864
01:44:26.730 --> 01:44:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Because everybody has this romantic idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he comes along and just squashes it,</v>

1865
01:44:33.210 --> 01:44:34.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

1866
01:44:34.410 --> 01:44:35.860
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1867
01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:39.690
<v Speaker 1>have disappointed a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>

1868
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:42.780
<v Speaker 1>reality is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Facts are good.</v>

1869
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:47.200
<v Speaker 1>What a guy did do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1870
01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:50.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of made me think,</v>

1871
01:44:50.530 --> 01:44:53.220
<v Speaker 1>made me think maybe there is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

1872
01:44:53.221 --> 01:44:55.260
<v Speaker 1>He's tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1873
01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:01.280
<v Speaker 1>pre dosing with an Mao inhibitor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take a stereopsis t without the </v>

1874
01:45:02.251 --> 01:45:06.540
<v Speaker 1>admixture about 30 minutes before going </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the light and then the,</v>

1875
01:45:06.541 --> 01:45:09.480
<v Speaker 1>it's much more intense of it's much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>prolonged.</v>

1876
01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:11.340
<v Speaker 1>You've done this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done it,</v>

1877
01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:16.370
<v Speaker 1>but he claims that have other people say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it definitely enhances the.</v>

1878
01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:21.400
<v Speaker 1>So that would indicate that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakdown of DMT is being</v>

1879
01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:27.010
<v Speaker 3>inhibited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he claiming that you could reach </v>

1880
01:45:27.010 --> 01:45:29.060
<v Speaker 3>actual dmt states with this device upon </v>
<v Speaker 3>practice?</v>

1881
01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:31.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about in the tank?</v>

1882
01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems designed for the tank,</v>

1883
01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:38.510
<v Speaker 3>but how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you put the light in the tank?</v>

1884
01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:43.540
<v Speaker 3>You just suspended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suspended from the ceiling and put a </v>

1885
01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:43.900
<v Speaker 3>switch on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>climb in,</v>

1886
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:46.820
<v Speaker 3>hit the switch and lay down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could try it.</v>

1887
01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could try it.</v>

1888
01:45:48.410 --> 01:45:53.410
<v Speaker 3>That seems like the way I'm going to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hold of crash from the float lab </v>

1889
01:45:53.410 --> 01:45:56.680
<v Speaker 3>because crash was trying to put a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the mad scientist behind the float </v>

1890
01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:59.520
<v Speaker 3>lab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the most advanced serum he saw,</v>

1891
01:45:59.521 --> 01:46:04.521
<v Speaker 3>that contraption that we have back there</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is state of the art as it gets in </v>

1892
01:46:04.521 --> 01:46:08.481
<v Speaker 3>the world of tanks and he had a concept </v>
<v Speaker 3>for developing learning,</v>

1893
01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:11.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>films,</v>

1894
01:46:12.150 --> 01:46:16.050
<v Speaker 3>films where you would lie down and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the absence of any physical input,</v>

1895
01:46:16.051 --> 01:46:21.051
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or very minimal be meaning that you're </v>

1896
01:46:21.051 --> 01:46:21.051
<v Speaker 3>floating in that environment.</v>

1897
01:46:21.051 --> 01:46:25.830
<v Speaker 3>He was going to suspend an LCD screen at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lowest possible light emission.</v>

1898
01:46:26.001 --> 01:46:27.980
<v Speaker 3>So you would not be able to see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>edges of the screen.</v>

1899
01:46:27.981 --> 01:46:32.981
<v Speaker 3>You would just be able to see the images</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the screen and they would play </v>

1900
01:46:32.981 --> 01:46:34.640
<v Speaker 3>instructional videos and things and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would learn them with the minimal amount</v>

1901
01:46:34.641 --> 01:46:36.680
<v Speaker 3>of distractions and you think you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>achieve.</v>

1902
01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:39.740
<v Speaker 3>His thought was that you could achieve </v>
<v Speaker 3>accelerated learning.</v>

1903
01:46:40.010 --> 01:46:40.660
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1904
01:46:40.661 --> 01:46:45.661
<v Speaker 3>like perhaps you could work on your golf</v>
<v Speaker 3>swing or something like that or some </v>

1905
01:46:45.661 --> 01:46:49.960
<v Speaker 3>thing that you could get in there or </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe musical instruments that you'd be </v>

1906
01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:51.870
<v Speaker 3>able to pick up concepts and things with</v>
<v Speaker 3>minimal distraction.</v>

1907
01:46:52.770 --> 01:46:53.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very interesting.</v>

1908
01:46:53.911 --> 01:46:55.230
<v Speaker 3>You have a lot of experience with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tank.</v>

1909
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:57.000
<v Speaker 3>Almost none.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1910
01:46:57.001 --> 01:46:58.260
<v Speaker 3>it's so great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1911
01:46:58.310 --> 01:47:03.310
<v Speaker 3>you would love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's really great for working out </v>

1912
01:47:03.310 --> 01:47:05.721
<v Speaker 3>ideas for one of the best environments </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world for working on a,</v>

1913
01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:10.290
<v Speaker 3>a thought because there's no input.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not thinking about anything else.</v>

1914
01:47:10.291 --> 01:47:12.240
<v Speaker 3>You just in total silence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>total darkness,</v>

1915
01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:14.970
<v Speaker 3>very relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're floating and you,</v>

1916
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the absence of this input,</v>

1917
01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:19.140
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain has more resources.</v>

1918
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:22.440
<v Speaker 3>Is it similar to a psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience?</v>

1919
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:23.610
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1920
01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.470
<v Speaker 3>you can try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's here.</v>

1921
01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:26.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got,</v>

1922
01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:27.880
<v Speaker 3>you got some time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it</v>

1923
01:47:28.410 --> 01:47:31.560
<v Speaker 1>actually not today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to go to another interview,</v>

1924
01:47:31.561 --> 01:47:33.210
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1925
01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it kosher to ask you?</v>

1926
01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Have you taken psychedelics and gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the tank or of course you'd never </v>

1927
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:43.770
<v Speaker 1>stuff the best for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This stuff?</v>

1928
01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Well this is legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff's good.</v>

1929
01:47:47.470 --> 01:47:48.550
<v Speaker 1>This one's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1930
01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:49.080
<v Speaker 1>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1931
01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:54.130
<v Speaker 1>that one's not legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this one's not legal.</v>

1932
01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:56.350
<v Speaker 1>This one's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1933
01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Depends on who you're asking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what the key is.</v>

1934
01:48:00.281 --> 01:48:01.530
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1935
01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:05.980
<v Speaker 3>did get a good baseline of sobriety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it,</v>

1936
01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:11.220
<v Speaker 3>doing it sober.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my favorite is actually edible </v>

1937
01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:12.580
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think edible marijuana,</v>

1938
01:48:12.581 --> 01:48:17.581
<v Speaker 3>especially high doses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in that complete darkness </v>

1939
01:48:17.651 --> 01:48:21.550
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Profound visuals like really bizarre,</v>

1940
01:48:21.551 --> 01:48:24.810
<v Speaker 3>strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange visuals and they,</v>

1941
01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:27.280
<v Speaker 3>they kind of dance for you in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>

1942
01:48:27.281 --> 01:48:32.281
<v Speaker 3>really wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the best environment ever </v>

1943
01:48:32.281 --> 01:48:32.281
<v Speaker 3>for edible marijuana.</v>

1944
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis could an invocation me in the </v>

1945
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:40.270
<v Speaker 1>immersion tech?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget the Ige delight ship.</v>

1946
01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:43.340
<v Speaker 1>The immersion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you do if we got you one?</v>

1947
01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have room for it?</v>

1948
01:48:44.630 --> 01:48:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't have room for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you living these days?</v>

1949
01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I am living in St Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota.</v>

1950
01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Still in Minnesota.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1951
01:48:51.530 --> 01:48:55.220
<v Speaker 1>But I am moving to Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm immigrating to Canada.</v>

1952
01:48:55.420 --> 01:48:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This Donald Trump stuff.</v>

1953
01:48:57.410 --> 01:48:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Got you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1954
01:48:58.190 --> 01:49:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Got Me down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not participating anymore.</v>

1955
01:49:03.290 --> 01:49:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Now that my wife has got her little five</v>
<v Speaker 1>year pension,</v>

1956
01:49:07.491 --> 01:49:10.160
<v Speaker 1>she's able to retire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's Canadian.</v>

1957
01:49:10.161 --> 01:49:13.150
<v Speaker 1>So she's my ticket out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

1958
01:49:13.210 --> 01:49:16.250
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you moving up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am moving to British Columbia.</v>

1959
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:20.180
<v Speaker 1>You were teaching in Minnesota a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

1960
01:49:20.181 --> 01:49:25.181
<v Speaker 1>I was teaching at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota and then I stepped back from </v>

1961
01:49:25.181 --> 01:49:28.601
<v Speaker 1>that for a couple of years ago because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just didn't have time and it was an </v>

1962
01:49:28.601 --> 01:49:30.290
<v Speaker 1>adjunct professor position.</v>

1963
01:49:30.290 --> 01:49:34.760
<v Speaker 1>So the equation between the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and the amount of compensation just</v>

1964
01:49:35.330 --> 01:49:39.350
<v Speaker 1>didn't make sense for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I enjoyed it a lot but I,</v>

1965
01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I've lived in BC a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost three quarters.</v>

1966
01:49:43.450 --> 01:49:43.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1967
01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:48.940
<v Speaker 1>I got my phd at UBC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daughter's got dual citizenship and </v>

1968
01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:52.330
<v Speaker 1>she's up there now and I love it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1969
01:49:52.331 --> 01:49:54.290
<v Speaker 1>We're going to move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>

1970
01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:54.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1971
01:49:55.050 --> 01:50:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm applied for my permanent residence </v>

1972
01:50:00.050 --> 01:50:02.140
<v Speaker 1>and there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no reason why I wouldn't get it.</v>

1973
01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:04.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty simple a thing.</v>

1974
01:50:04.901 --> 01:50:08.260
<v Speaker 1>So that will happen next spring as soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>as we can.</v>

1975
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:13.470
<v Speaker 1>We gotta wait for House,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to wait for the prime time to sell </v>

1976
01:50:13.470 --> 01:50:15.250
<v Speaker 1>our house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will be next February.</v>

1977
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:20.830
<v Speaker 1>And also time is the winter end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>winter,</v>

1978
01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:24.250
<v Speaker 1>I would think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's going anywhere and people start</v>

1979
01:50:24.251 --> 01:50:29.251
<v Speaker 1>looking at the end of February.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a hot time too because it's a </v>

1980
01:50:29.251 --> 01:50:29.470
<v Speaker 1>buy.</v>

1981
01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:31.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a seller's market right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1982
01:50:31.381 --> 01:50:34.480
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go up there.</v>

1983
01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:36.310
<v Speaker 1>What part of BC?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1984
01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:41.340
<v Speaker 1>around Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we probably won't be able to afford to </v>

1985
01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:44.260
<v Speaker 1>live in Vancouver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The housing market is utterly nuts,</v>

1986
01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:48.490
<v Speaker 1>but somewhere close by white rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abbotsford.</v>

1987
01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Have you looked at Vancouver island?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1988
01:50:51.570 --> 01:50:55.600
<v Speaker 1>we've looked at Vancouver and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that much less expensive there.</v>

1989
01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:00.310
<v Speaker 1>It's nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's logistically it's a problem.</v>

1990
01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:03.940
<v Speaker 1>I can go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to take a ferry.</v>

1991
01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:06.670
<v Speaker 1>So I'm looking forward to hold the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the work,</v>

1992
01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:10.480
<v Speaker 1>all the travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do need to be close to the airport,</v>

1993
01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:12.130
<v Speaker 1>but I am excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1994
01:51:12.131 --> 01:51:13.300
<v Speaker 1>for one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1995
01:51:13.930 --> 01:51:16.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my colleague Wade Davis is up there,</v>

1996
01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:20.470
<v Speaker 1>you know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the person that wrote one river.</v>

1997
01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:25.150
<v Speaker 1>He was a protege of shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a graduate student of shelties.</v>

1998
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:30.130
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the editors on this and very well</v>

1999
01:51:30.131 --> 01:51:35.131
<v Speaker 1>known as an ethnobotanist and for years </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the explorer in residence for the</v>

2000
01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:37.780
<v Speaker 1>National Geographic.</v>

2001
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:43.350
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy that worked out the Zombie </v>
<v Speaker 1>poisoned mystery back in the day,</v>

2002
01:51:43.450 --> 01:51:44.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Haiti.</v>

2003
01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's that guy,</v>

2004
01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:52.260
<v Speaker 1>but he's written a lot of excellent </v>
<v Speaker 1>books and now he's a Columbian.</v>

2005
01:51:52.991 --> 01:51:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Devil's dust or whatever the hell that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2006
01:51:54.851 --> 01:51:55.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2007
01:51:55.390 --> 01:51:57.300
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's broke Vancea.</v>

2008
01:51:57.310 --> 01:51:58.960
<v Speaker 1>That's tollway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2009
01:51:58.961 --> 01:52:03.961
<v Speaker 1>this is the Saab beat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Madison is a tetrodotoxin,</v>

2010
01:52:05.410 --> 01:52:10.410
<v Speaker 1>which is a toxin from puffer fish as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as other other marine sources.</v>

2011
01:52:11.951 --> 01:52:16.951
<v Speaker 1>It's a tetrodotoxin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a paralytic,</v>

2012
01:52:17.260 --> 01:52:22.260
<v Speaker 1>neurotoxin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That utterly paralyzes you for about 48 </v>

2013
01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:23.070
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2014
01:52:23.230 --> 01:52:25.210
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're completely conscious.</v>

2015
01:52:25.211 --> 01:52:28.240
<v Speaker 1>You can hear everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't move a muscle.</v>

2016
01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:31.810
<v Speaker 1>And so in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Zombie context,</v>

2017
01:52:31.811 --> 01:52:34.720
<v Speaker 1>they would contrive to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2018
01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:38.140
<v Speaker 1>give this to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they want to put the whammy on them,</v>

2019
01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:41.500
<v Speaker 1>then they would bury them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

2020
01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:46.800
<v Speaker 1>And if they were lucky they would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they would assume that like 48 </v>

2021
01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:49.880
<v Speaker 1>hours later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course a lot of them did die,</v>

2022
01:52:49.881 --> 01:52:53.000
<v Speaker 1>but if they were alive then they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be zombies.</v>

2023
01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:58.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't give them a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mixture of a detour and other bad </v>

2024
01:52:58.041 --> 01:53:02.960
<v Speaker 1>things that would destroy their memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>and completely discombobulate them.</v>

2025
01:53:02.961 --> 01:53:06.970
<v Speaker 1>And then they would send them off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would spend their life as you know,</v>

2026
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.520
<v Speaker 1>sort of wandering around completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2027
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:13.350
<v Speaker 1>shells of their former self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2028
01:53:13.351 --> 01:53:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Did the Torah has permanent effects like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

2029
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:18.140
<v Speaker 1>It can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can.</v>

2030
01:53:18.141 --> 01:53:21.500
<v Speaker 1>And after this traumatic experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could imagine,</v>

2031
01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:24.590
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'd worked all that out.</v>

2032
01:53:24.591 --> 01:53:29.591
<v Speaker 1>His first book was called the serpent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rainbow that was made into a </v>

2033
01:53:29.591 --> 01:53:29.591
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2034
01:53:29.591 --> 01:53:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Terrible film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but good book.</v>

2035
01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:36.500
<v Speaker 1>But later he wrote a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote many books.</v>

2036
01:53:36.530 --> 01:53:41.530
<v Speaker 1>His most memorable one is basically a </v>
<v Speaker 1>biography of shelties called the one </v>

2037
01:53:42.081 --> 01:53:47.081
<v Speaker 1>river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one river adventures in the Amazon or </v>

2038
01:53:47.081 --> 01:53:51.731
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be a great guy to bring it on your </v>

2039
01:53:51.731 --> 01:53:51.731
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds awesome.</v>

2040
01:53:51.731 --> 01:53:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Very articulate man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2041
01:53:54.231 --> 01:53:59.090
<v Speaker 1>we worked actually this hair collitus </v>
<v Speaker 1>expedition I was telling you on wade was</v>

2042
01:53:59.091 --> 01:54:02.000
<v Speaker 1>on that expedition and I've gotten to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know him.</v>

2043
01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:04.670
<v Speaker 1>I consider him a good friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's now.</v>

2044
01:54:06.890 --> 01:54:11.890
<v Speaker 1>He's an endowed professor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropology at the University of </v>

2045
01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:15.590
<v Speaker 1>British Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sounds real stuffy and it is.</v>

2046
01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:19.500
<v Speaker 1>But he's not a stuffy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got wonderful tales to tell.</v>

2047
01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can guarantee you that there's float </v>

2048
01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:25.100
<v Speaker 1>tank centers in Vancouver float tank </v>
<v Speaker 1>centers in Vancouver.</v>

2049
01:54:25.130 --> 01:54:26.300
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get you connected.</v>

2050
01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Nokia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need.</v>

2051
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:29.960
<v Speaker 1>You need this in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to.</v>

2052
01:54:29.961 --> 01:54:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great physically to just,</v>

2053
01:54:33.021 --> 01:54:36.590
<v Speaker 1>you feel very relaxed and out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My issue always,</v>

2054
01:54:36.591 --> 01:54:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I just never feel like I have time,</v>

2055
01:54:39.141 --> 01:54:43.760
<v Speaker 1>but that's my issue as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Change my attitude about that.</v>

2056
01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:48.170
<v Speaker 1>I realize that I need to take time out </v>
<v Speaker 1>to care for my body.</v>

2057
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:50.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't do enough of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2058
01:54:50.530 --> 01:54:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm hoping that when I move up to BC</v>

2059
01:54:53.871 --> 01:54:57.110
<v Speaker 1>wait and I can do some work together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even teach,</v>

2060
01:54:57.220 --> 01:54:59.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work on this thing in South America,</v>

2061
01:54:59.451 --> 01:55:02.360

<v Speaker 1>because with him,</v>

2062
01:55:03.250 --> 01:55:08.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as one of the faculty that will bring a </v>

2063
01:55:08.250 --> 01:55:08.250
<v Speaker 1>lot of people.</v>

2064
01:55:08.250 --> 01:55:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's high profile and really a good guy.</v>

2065
01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:12.050
<v Speaker 1>That's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2066
01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:13.760
<v Speaker 1>So do you have a timeline for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

2067
01:55:13.810 --> 01:55:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Improve a wealth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening faster than I had dared </v>

2068
01:55:21.001 --> 01:55:23.120
<v Speaker 1>to hope actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2069
01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:24.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2070
01:55:24.321 --> 01:55:29.321
<v Speaker 1>I hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to predict and then not be able </v>

2071
01:55:29.321 --> 01:55:29.321
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2072
01:55:29.321 --> 01:55:33.230
<v Speaker 1>but my guess is that a year from now </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be on the way.</v>

2073
01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:38.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is all happening and this is the </v>

2074
01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:40.490
<v Speaker 1>formative year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know where we want to go.</v>

2075
01:55:40.491 --> 01:55:44.700
<v Speaker 1>We're talking to investors who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously interested.</v>

2076
01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:49.730
<v Speaker 1>They want to get involved and they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and it's not just about money.</v>

2077
01:55:51.401 --> 01:55:53.020
<v Speaker 1>They also have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2078
01:55:53.021 --> 01:55:58.021
<v Speaker 1>they've listened to the medicine man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about the medicine as we know,</v>

2079
01:55:58.341 --> 01:56:01.370
<v Speaker 1>changes people's hearts and minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these folks,</v>

2080
01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:05.390
<v Speaker 1>they have the resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they realize there's a larger vision</v>

2081
01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:07.520
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2082
01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:13.090
<v Speaker 1>for me personally what I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of my problem is I'm running around</v>

2083
01:56:14.211 --> 01:56:17.180
<v Speaker 1>the world all the time and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>these conferences,</v>

2084
01:56:17.181 --> 01:56:20.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm propagating the message and I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop myself.</v>

2085
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:21.710
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

2086
01:56:21.711 --> 01:56:25.010
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a holism and takes it,</v>

2087
01:56:25.011 --> 01:56:28.400
<v Speaker 1>takes a lot out of me and it keeps me </v>
<v Speaker 1>distracted.</v>

2088
01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:33.460
<v Speaker 1>So what I want to do if possible is pull</v>
<v Speaker 1>my elbows in a little bit and say,</v>

2089
01:56:35.090 --> 01:56:39.140
<v Speaker 1>rather than go to your conference in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prague or your conference and,</v>

2090
01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:43.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever create this place and make that</v>

2091
01:56:43.961 --> 01:56:48.770
<v Speaker 1>a place where people can come and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>really rich experiences,</v>

2092
01:56:48.771 --> 01:56:51.200
<v Speaker 1>whether or not they involve </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics,</v>

2093
01:56:51.230 --> 01:56:54.050
<v Speaker 1>they can have rich learning experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2094
01:56:54.051 --> 01:56:57.650
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect location.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Want to learn about the incas.</v>

2095
01:56:57.740 --> 01:57:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Machu Picchu is right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all there.</v>

2096
01:57:00.860 --> 01:57:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's just,</v>

2097
01:57:02.721 --> 01:57:03.370
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2098
01:57:03.371 --> 01:57:05.890
<v Speaker 1>I've always liked the idea of platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2099
01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:08.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to create a platform.</v>

2100
01:57:08.231 --> 01:57:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>catalytic nexus for global consciousness</v>

2101
01:57:12.191 --> 01:57:14.290
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the idea.</v>

2102
01:57:14.890 --> 01:57:17.740
<v Speaker 1>And do therapeutic programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retreats,</v>

2103
01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:21.850
<v Speaker 1>impactful conferences like Michael </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pollan level,</v>

2104
01:57:21.970 --> 01:57:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Graham Hancock level Joe Rogan level </v>
<v Speaker 1>conferences.</v>

2105
01:57:25.601 --> 01:57:27.550
<v Speaker 1>If I could ever convince you to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

2106
01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:32.560
<v Speaker 1>which may be will happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it will someday and uh,</v>

2107
01:57:33.370 --> 01:57:35.800
<v Speaker 1>and just use it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a platform.</v>

2108
01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:38.130
<v Speaker 1>I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2109
01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:43.160
<v Speaker 1>I liked the academic idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use it as a place where we can try to </v>

2110
01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:46.220
<v Speaker 1>understand ourselves and our place in </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature better,</v>

2111
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:47.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2112
01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:52.600
<v Speaker 1>and through plant medicines and clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking and creative people and uh,</v>

2113
01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:57.180
<v Speaker 1>and just make it that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I can be like,</v>

2114
01:57:58.450 --> 01:57:59.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2115
01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I can be more in residence there and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to keep running around the </v>

2116
01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:08.371
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say I'm the girl in </v>

2117
01:58:08.371 --> 01:58:08.371
<v Speaker 1>residence because my first thing is I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know girl,</v>

2118
01:58:08.371 --> 01:58:11.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just alerting or like everybody else</v>

2119
01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:12.940
<v Speaker 1>email.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2120
01:58:12.970 --> 01:58:15.340
<v Speaker 1>we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all just curious monkeys,</v>

2121
01:58:15.341 --> 01:58:16.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2122
01:58:17.550 --> 01:58:22.550
<v Speaker 3>What seems to me that with psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the interest and the desire far exceeds </v>

2123
01:58:23.761 --> 01:58:25.200
<v Speaker 3>the access.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2124
01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Especially in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many people that really have </v>

2125
01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:33.561
<v Speaker 3>no idea where to start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell you how many people have </v>

2126
01:58:33.561 --> 01:58:33.561
<v Speaker 3>asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2127
01:58:33.561 --> 01:58:36.651
<v Speaker 3>how do I get mushrooms?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just even amongst people that you </v>

2128
01:58:36.651 --> 01:58:38.910
<v Speaker 3>would think would know someone who would</v>
<v Speaker 3>have something,</v>

2129
01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:44.480
<v Speaker 3>but it's one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things where we're </v>

2130
01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:47.830
<v Speaker 3>going to have to wait until things get </v>
<v Speaker 3>more legal until the environment changes</v>

2131
01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:50.590
<v Speaker 3>and it seems to be moving in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is,</v>

2132
01:58:50.610 --> 01:58:55.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Hopkins doing research and there's </v>

2133
01:58:55.610 --> 01:58:59.611
<v Speaker 3>all these different studies that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>being made through maps in particular </v>

2134
01:58:59.611 --> 01:59:02.500
<v Speaker 3>and various other organizations are </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to push this idea of,</v>

2135
01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:06.160
<v Speaker 3>especially in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>working with soldiers,</v>

2136
01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:11.400
<v Speaker 3>people with PTSD and showing these </v>
<v Speaker 3>massive results and that to open up </v>

2137
01:59:12.011 --> 01:59:14.470
<v Speaker 3>people's minds that there's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different things.</v>

2138
01:59:14.471 --> 01:59:19.471
<v Speaker 3>MTMA being one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psilocybin being another and then </v>

2139
01:59:19.471 --> 01:59:20.800
<v Speaker 3>hopefully eventually we'll work our way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to dmt.</v>

2140
01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the attractions of,</v>

2141
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:27.820
<v Speaker 1>of creativeness platform in the sacred </v>
<v Speaker 1>valley because the whole.</v>

2142
01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Or in Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the whole regulatory framework </v>

2143
01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:33.610
<v Speaker 1>is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2144
01:59:34.150 --> 01:59:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Peru is declared Iowasca national </v>
<v Speaker 1>patrimony and there's no restriction on </v>

2145
01:59:39.641 --> 01:59:44.230
<v Speaker 1>the use of Iowaska and all these other </v>
<v Speaker 1>plant medicines are part of a tradition,</v>

2146
01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:46.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Pedro called watch,</v>

2147
01:59:46.571 --> 01:59:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Houma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2148
01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:50.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the snuffs will snuff.</v>

2149
01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:53.410
<v Speaker 1>All of these things can be used without </v>
<v Speaker 1>restriction.</v>

2150
01:59:53.411 --> 01:59:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know about the status of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>

2151
01:59:55.751 --> 02:00:00.751
<v Speaker 1>but I think with a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transparency we could also get </v>

2152
02:00:01.041 --> 02:00:06.041
<v Speaker 1>permission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could probably use them at </v>

2153
02:00:06.041 --> 02:00:09.661
<v Speaker 1>this place and nobody would say a word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we wanted to we could get </v>

2154
02:00:09.661 --> 02:00:12.871
<v Speaker 1>permission to use them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the idea is to not restricted</v>

2155
02:00:13.390 --> 02:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>to Iowasca be able to look at all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these plant medicines in a very </v>

2156
02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:21.940
<v Speaker 1>intelligent way and also bring science </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shamanism together,</v>

2157
02:00:21.970 --> 02:00:25.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work with smart Shamans who also want to</v>

2158
02:00:25.061 --> 02:00:26.110
<v Speaker 1>work with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2159
02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>with clinicians to develop a really new </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradigm that combines the best of both.</v>

2160
02:00:34.150 --> 02:00:36.820
<v Speaker 1>And Michael Paulin refers to this a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

2161
02:00:36.821 --> 02:00:39.700
<v Speaker 1>but he kind of glosses over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's where the,</v>

2162
02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:43.190
<v Speaker 1>the therapeutic revolution is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come.</v>

2163
02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:47.930
<v Speaker 1>When you fuse shamanism and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the clinical approach.</v>

2164
02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:53.260
<v Speaker 1>And you can do all that there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop models that can be used other </v>

2165
02:00:54.171 --> 02:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>places and you don't have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>secretive about it,</v>

2166
02:00:57.230 --> 02:01:02.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be ashamed or we're </v>

2167
02:01:02.230 --> 02:01:03.440
<v Speaker 1>not doing anything illegal or covert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so again,</v>

2168
02:01:03.470 --> 02:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2169
02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:06.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than being sort of,</v>

2170
02:01:07.330 --> 02:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2171
02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:12.860
<v Speaker 1>what we can shout it from the rooftops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to,</v>

2172
02:01:12.890 --> 02:01:17.890
<v Speaker 1>not that we necessarily would do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can be open about what we're </v>

2173
02:01:17.890 --> 02:01:18.800
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are also a lot of good,</v>

2174
02:01:19.010 --> 02:01:24.010
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of smart people in Peru </v>
<v Speaker 1>and smart doctors and so on,</v>

2175
02:01:24.141 --> 02:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>smart clinicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we want to involve local communities,</v>

2176
02:01:28.191 --> 02:01:33.191
<v Speaker 1>local people as much as possible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then expand that to all the other things</v>

2177
02:01:34.581 --> 02:01:39.581
<v Speaker 1>that this relates to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sustainable agriculture.</v>

2178
02:01:39.810 --> 02:01:42.800
<v Speaker 1>And it's a perfect place to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2179
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:45.460
<v Speaker 1>new paradigms for food production and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

2180
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:50.510
<v Speaker 1>The Sacred Valley is one of the five </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas in the world where agriculture </v>

2181
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.750
<v Speaker 1>originated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2182
02:01:51.050 --> 02:01:54.380
<v Speaker 1>most of our important food plants came </v>
<v Speaker 1>from there.</v>

2183
02:01:54.381 --> 02:01:59.381
<v Speaker 1>Originally they have 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>varieties of potatoes for thousand </v>

2184
02:01:59.381 --> 02:02:03.020
<v Speaker 1>varieties of tomatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really incredible food,</v>

2185
02:02:03.021 --> 02:02:06.980
<v Speaker 1>bio diversity and the foods that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone global,</v>

2186
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>how many varieties of potatoes doc in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2187
02:02:10.190 --> 02:02:13.340
<v Speaker 1>in the grocery store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe four or five at most.</v>

2188
02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:18.790
<v Speaker 1>So there is an incredible genetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>repository of these things that have </v>

2189
02:02:20.451 --> 02:02:23.690
<v Speaker 1>never really been developed on a global </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale and a lot of them,</v>

2190
02:02:23.950 --> 02:02:28.950
<v Speaker 1>that's our part of the solution to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>food crisis that we face.</v>

2191
02:02:29.900 --> 02:02:34.900
<v Speaker 1>And also what the incas knew about </v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture is it was pretty </v>

2192
02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:36.050
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the,</v>

2193
02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:38.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spectrum is broad.</v>

2194
02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to have a standardized </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredients list when it comes to like </v>

2195
02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Iowasca?</v>

2196
02:02:43.670 --> 02:02:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Like in terms of like the dosage that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>work that we want to do?</v>

2197
02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not necessarily to impose it on </v>

2198
02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:55.991
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I think it could benefit </v>

2199
02:02:55.991 --> 02:02:56.720
<v Speaker 1>from a bit of analytical work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like,</v>

2200
02:02:56.780 --> 02:02:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also interested in the,</v>

2201
02:02:59.541 --> 02:03:04.541
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of the Pharmacopia of other </v>

2202
02:03:04.541 --> 02:03:06.050
<v Speaker 1>plants that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are associated with Iowasca.</v>

2203
02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:09.170
<v Speaker 1>They're not put into Iowasca all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

2204
02:03:09.171 --> 02:03:12.340
<v Speaker 1>but they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they use for the [inaudible],</v>

2205
02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole pharmacopia plants not </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well investigated that I'd like to </v>

2206
02:03:18.010 --> 02:03:22.510
<v Speaker 1>look more deeply into and maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop formulations of Iowasca with </v>

2207
02:03:26.181 --> 02:03:31.181
<v Speaker 1>some of these other plants that could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>used for more specific therapeutic </v>

2208
02:03:32.001 --> 02:03:37.001
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might have one that's good for </v>

2209
02:03:37.001 --> 02:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>say ptsd and one that's better for </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and you know,</v>

2210
02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:44.020
<v Speaker 1>you could actually tailor these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring a little science into it because </v>

2211
02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2212
02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:48.590
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have to have a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2213
02:03:48.591 --> 02:03:51.230
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to have gleaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>laboratories for this.</v>

2214
02:03:51.230 --> 02:03:55.370
<v Speaker 1>You can do it with a very simple setup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple natural products.</v>

2215
02:03:55.371 --> 02:04:00.371
<v Speaker 1>Laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most importantly is the people that you </v>

2216
02:04:00.371 --> 02:04:01.250
<v Speaker 1>have in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the equipment that you have.</v>

2217
02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:06.340
<v Speaker 1>And you could do a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly this is what this book is </v>

2218
02:04:06.340 --> 02:04:09.500
<v Speaker 1>about to the Ethno pharmacologic search </v>
<v Speaker 1>for psychoactive drugs.</v>

2219
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2220
02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:15.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2221
02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:17.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what's in this book is,</v>

2222
02:04:18.010 --> 02:04:23.010
<v Speaker 1>is talking about the Iowaska and Peyote </v>
<v Speaker 1>and things that we know about.</v>

2223
02:04:24.350 --> 02:04:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but talking about it in ways that we've </v>

2224
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:33.641
<v Speaker 1>never looked at it before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there is a whole bunch of </v>

2225
02:04:33.641 --> 02:04:34.790
<v Speaker 1>things out there that really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2226
02:04:34.791 --> 02:04:38.610
<v Speaker 1>there's a great future for discovery </v>
<v Speaker 1>things we've never heard of,</v>

2227
02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:44.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what ethno pharmacology is </v>

2228
02:04:44.260 --> 02:04:46.401
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And specifically it's the ethno </v>

2229
02:04:46.401 --> 02:04:46.890
<v Speaker 1>pharmacology search for a psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>

2230
02:04:46.891 --> 02:04:49.830
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot still to be discovered.</v>

2231
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada has just recently legalized </v>

2232
02:04:55.310 --> 02:04:55.730
<v Speaker 1>marijuana as of today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2233
02:04:55.900 --> 02:05:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they have any plans or do you know </v>

2234
02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:02.850
<v Speaker 1>of considering the legality of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>substances?</v>

2235
02:05:03.210 --> 02:05:04.590
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

2236
02:05:05.250 --> 02:05:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>

2237
02:05:07.531 --> 02:05:09.480
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't really talk about it.</v>

2238
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't talk about it because I </v>

2239
02:05:14.990 --> 02:05:17.481
<v Speaker 1>don't have that much information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is a gentleman who came to one</v>

2240
02:05:17.791 --> 02:05:21.750
<v Speaker 1>of my retreats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I meet the most interesting people.</v>

2241
02:05:21.751 --> 02:05:23.830
<v Speaker 1>If these retreats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't believe it.</v>

2242
02:05:24.210 --> 02:05:28.890
<v Speaker 1>This guy is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a of aspiring young politician,</v>

2243
02:05:28.891 --> 02:05:33.891
<v Speaker 1>Canadian politician from Ottawa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's talking to Justin about legalizing </v>

2244
02:05:36.541 --> 02:05:39.150
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics for therapeutic uses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2245
02:05:39.210 --> 02:05:41.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working with some,</v>

2246
02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:45.870
<v Speaker 1>some lawyers and so on and putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>together a proposal to do this.</v>

2247
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Mtma assisted psychotherapy trials begin</v>
<v Speaker 1>final phase in Vancouver.</v>

2248
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

2249
02:05:51.091 --> 02:05:52.500
<v Speaker 1>But that's maps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2250
02:05:52.501 --> 02:05:56.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the catalyst behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to change policy.</v>

2251
02:05:56.970 --> 02:06:00.120
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is the Canadians are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable people.</v>

2252
02:06:00.121 --> 02:06:02.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the big difference from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>

2253
02:06:02.970 --> 02:06:07.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can propose this kind of thing and </v>

2254
02:06:07.970 --> 02:06:07.970
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't dismiss it out of hand,</v>

2255
02:06:07.970 --> 02:06:08.850
<v Speaker 1>lol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2256
02:06:08.851 --> 02:06:10.830
<v Speaker 1>what's your evidence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should we do this?</v>

2257
02:06:10.831 --> 02:06:15.831
<v Speaker 1>So Justin's a very young guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's young and I imagine he's been </v>

2258
02:06:15.831 --> 02:06:18.810
<v Speaker 1>beyond the chrysanthemum a time or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

2259
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2260
02:06:20.370 --> 02:06:21.990
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2261
02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:24.540
<v Speaker 1>What makes you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he's spoken about it.</v>

2262
02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:30.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he wouldn't speak about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess just to guess he's the right </v>

2263
02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2264
02:06:33.090 --> 02:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while I can't say it's just pure </v>

2265
02:06:38.090 --> 02:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put it this way,</v>

2266
02:06:38.100 --> 02:06:43.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be surprised for people that </v>

2267
02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:45.651
<v Speaker 1>don't know what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond the Cassandra means there's this </v>

2268
02:06:45.651 --> 02:06:48.951
<v Speaker 1>thing that you see when you break </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and you do dmt that's very </v>

2269
02:06:48.951 --> 02:06:50.540
<v Speaker 1>bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geometric pattern that resembles a Santa</v>

2270
02:06:50.540 --> 02:06:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Mum.</v>

2271
02:06:50.650 --> 02:06:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2272
02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:53.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2273
02:06:53.650 --> 02:06:54.870
<v Speaker 1>the Canadians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2274
02:06:54.871 --> 02:06:59.871
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get approval for these Mtma trolls </v>

2275
02:06:59.871 --> 02:07:01.470
<v Speaker 1>was a lot more straightforward in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

2276
02:07:01.630 --> 02:07:02.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2277
02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:08.540
<v Speaker 1>now and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've done some clinical studies </v>

2278
02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:10.020
<v Speaker 1>with Iowasca and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're board with that.</v>

2279
02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done some studies with </v>

2280
02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:16.890
<v Speaker 1>indigenous people in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call it first nations,</v>

2281
02:07:17.790 --> 02:07:22.790
<v Speaker 1>but they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have done that and it's been </v>

2282
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:25.460
<v Speaker 1>pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been straightforward to get that </v>

2283
02:07:25.460 --> 02:07:28.221
<v Speaker 1>work done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be drug hysteria that we </v>

2284
02:07:28.221 --> 02:07:28.221
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2285
02:07:28.290 --> 02:07:33.000
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's a good place to produce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue this research.</v>

2286
02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many ways they were victims of our </v>

2287
02:07:38.060 --> 02:07:38.060
<v Speaker 1>jug hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2288
02:07:38.060 --> 02:07:38.060
<v Speaker 1>and they sort</v>

2289
02:07:38.060 --> 02:07:38.830
<v Speaker 3>of adopted our ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2290
02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:44.460
<v Speaker 3>I'll be interested to see our response </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the legalization of cannabis.</v>

2291
02:07:44.830 --> 02:07:46.600
<v Speaker 3>That's gonna piss them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2292
02:07:46.601 --> 02:07:50.780
<v Speaker 3>it'll piss off that little elf sessions </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

2293
02:07:51.510 --> 02:07:56.510
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a just great team needs to be pissed </v>

2294
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:57.250
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's such a fool that guy,</v>

2295
02:07:57.720 --> 02:08:00.640
<v Speaker 3>this statement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good people don't smoke marijuana.</v>

2296
02:08:00.641 --> 02:08:04.930
<v Speaker 3>That is one of the dumbest fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>things anyone has ever said ever.</v>

2297
02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:09.460
<v Speaker 3>It's such a crazy thing to say like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is one of the dumbest generalizations,</v>

2298
02:08:09.930 --> 02:08:14.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like saying all white people are </v>

2299
02:08:14.930 --> 02:08:14.930
<v Speaker 3>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's just so stupid.</v>

2300
02:08:14.930 --> 02:08:17.680
<v Speaker 3>It's just stupid thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a stupid thing to say.</v>

2301
02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:22.920
<v Speaker 3>This idea that we could go right across </v>
<v Speaker 3>the border to Vancouver and experience,</v>

2302
02:08:24.590 --> 02:08:29.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the host of the psychedelic experiences </v>

2303
02:08:29.590 --> 02:08:29.590
<v Speaker 3>would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2304
02:08:29.590 --> 02:08:32.130
<v Speaker 3>that would be fantastic and I do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>equally.</v>

2305
02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:32.830
<v Speaker 3>I tanked it.</v>

2306
02:08:32.890 --> 02:08:35.200
<v Speaker 3>You'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see that very soon.</v>

2307
02:08:35.290 --> 02:08:39.610
<v Speaker 3>That would be amazing and I just hope it</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have a positive effect on,</v>

2308
02:08:39.690 --> 02:08:40.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our country.</v>

2309
02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:43.330
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

2310
02:08:43.390 --> 02:08:48.390
<v Speaker 3>When you think about how many troops </v>
<v Speaker 3>come back over from overseas with these </v>

2311
02:08:49.061 --> 02:08:54.061
<v Speaker 3>traumatic experiences and ptsd and real </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue psychologically in that the number</v>

2312
02:08:55.211 --> 02:08:57.400
<v Speaker 3>one tool for handling this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

2313
02:08:57.670 --> 02:09:00.700
<v Speaker 3>it's not psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The number one tool of psychedelics.</v>

2314
02:09:00.701 --> 02:09:05.020
<v Speaker 3>It's the best in terms of efficacy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of proven results.</v>

2315
02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:07.060
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing that's even remotely </v>
<v Speaker 3>close.</v>

2316
02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's true Mtma or psilocybin or </v>
<v Speaker 3>any of these psychedelic therapies.</v>

2317
02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:16.680
<v Speaker 3>They have profound effects when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the ability to disconnect from </v>

2318
02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:18.880
<v Speaker 3>addictive behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly drugs,</v>

2319
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:24.030
<v Speaker 3>opiates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing better than these </v>

2320
02:09:24.030 --> 02:09:24.340
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experiences particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ibogaine and you know,</v>

2321
02:09:24.341 --> 02:09:26.740
<v Speaker 3>you got to go to Mexico to go to t to </v>
<v Speaker 3>use Ibogaine,</v>

2322
02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:31.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think within five years you're </v>

2323
02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:34.030
<v Speaker 3>gonna see clinic sad and maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 3>centers,</v>

2324
02:09:34.031 --> 02:09:39.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>along the lines of what we're talking </v>

2325
02:09:39.031 --> 02:09:39.031
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2326
02:09:39.031 --> 02:09:39.720
<v Speaker 3>A know in the sacred valley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2327
02:09:39.730 --> 02:09:44.730
<v Speaker 3>once you've done something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can replicate it in different </v>

2328
02:09:44.730 --> 02:09:48.811
<v Speaker 3>countries where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the regulatory environment is </v>

2329
02:09:48.811 --> 02:09:48.811
<v Speaker 3>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could have,</v>

2330
02:09:48.910 --> 02:09:52.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have the Mckenna Academy and in Peru,</v>

2331
02:09:52.450 --> 02:09:53.750
<v Speaker 3>but then we have brand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2332
02:09:53.770 --> 02:09:58.770
<v Speaker 3>if they meet the standards then we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially licensed south that brand or</v>

2333
02:10:00.401 --> 02:10:02.260
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you could potentially do one in</v>

2334
02:10:02.261 --> 02:10:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Vancouver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

2335
02:10:03.700 --> 02:10:05.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be sensational.</v>

2336
02:10:06.020 --> 02:10:06.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2337
02:10:06.581 --> 02:10:07.720
<v Speaker 3>I'll help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God.</v>

2338
02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:10.330
<v Speaker 3>I'll go over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Vancouver.</v>

2339
02:10:10.450 --> 02:10:13.030
<v Speaker 3>I go there every chance I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's good.</v>

2340
02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:15.600
<v Speaker 3>So maybe I'll see you more often when.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2341
02:10:15.610 --> 02:10:16.490
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2342
02:10:16.930 --> 02:10:21.930
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still have to drag you to South </v>

2343
02:10:21.930 --> 02:10:21.930
<v Speaker 3>America all I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get you.</v>

2344
02:10:21.930 --> 02:10:26.220
<v Speaker 3>I'll get you one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have young kids and I'm always busy </v>

2345
02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:31.021
<v Speaker 3>and I travel too much as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a grind to get me out of the </v>

2346
02:10:31.021 --> 02:10:34.171
<v Speaker 3>content of the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that bring your wife and kids </v>

2347
02:10:34.171 --> 02:10:34.171
<v Speaker 3>to Peru to parade</v>

2348
02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:37.970
<v Speaker 1>around a bunch of hippies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we have a perfect place.</v>

2349
02:10:37.971 --> 02:10:40.720
<v Speaker 1>You know we can take care of the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a catch.</v>

2350
02:10:40.721 --> 02:10:45.721
<v Speaker 1>You have a family that runs one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>senators and they would love to take </v>

2351
02:10:45.721 --> 02:10:47.670
<v Speaker 1>care of your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your wife can do yoga.</v>

2352
02:10:47.671 --> 02:10:52.671
<v Speaker 1>It's or whatever she wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like how you say the wife could do </v>

2353
02:10:52.671 --> 02:10:52.671
<v Speaker 1>yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not going to trip to.</v>

2354
02:10:52.850 --> 02:10:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Of course she get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2355
02:10:54.690 --> 02:10:58.170
<v Speaker 1>she wants to track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you could do it.</v>

2356
02:10:59.060 --> 02:11:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Somebodies got to watch the kids though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turtle.</v>

2357
02:11:01.550 --> 02:11:06.550
<v Speaker 1>That's what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people who love kids and </v>

2358
02:11:06.550 --> 02:11:09.450
<v Speaker 1>they'll be happy to Babysit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'll happen when the time is.</v>

2359
02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:10.700
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

2360
02:11:11.770 --> 02:11:15.970
<v Speaker 3>positive benefits are so overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the evidence is so clear and so many</v>

2361
02:11:15.971 --> 02:11:20.971
<v Speaker 3>people have these incredibly powerful </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences that they're relaying to </v>

2362
02:11:20.971 --> 02:11:24.661
<v Speaker 3>other people and oftentimes it's people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are there like the people with the </v>

2363
02:11:25.121 --> 02:11:30.121
<v Speaker 3>closed minds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe their loved ones have had these </v>

2364
02:11:30.121 --> 02:11:32.941
<v Speaker 3>experiences and maybe their loved ones </v>
<v Speaker 3>were really far gone and have come back </v>

2365
02:11:32.941 --> 02:11:34.660
<v Speaker 3>and they can see these results and </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize that,</v>

2366
02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:37.810
<v Speaker 3>especially when it comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

2367
02:11:37.930 --> 02:11:42.930
<v Speaker 3>veterans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have an overwhelming responsibility </v>

2368
02:11:42.930 --> 02:11:42.930
<v Speaker 3>to take care of those people that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't meet.</v>

2369
02:11:42.930 --> 02:11:44.860
<v Speaker 3>We don't meet it medically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't meet it psychologically.</v>

2370
02:11:44.861 --> 02:11:47.380
<v Speaker 3>We don't meet it with therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just don't give them enough.</v>

2371
02:11:47.410 --> 02:11:52.410
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't meet it financially and this </v>

2372
02:11:52.410 --> 02:11:55.441
<v Speaker 3>could be a way to heal them to help help</v>
<v Speaker 3>them reconcile their experience and help</v>

2373
02:11:57.011 --> 02:12:00.880
<v Speaker 3>them achieve balance back here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2374
02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:02.950
<v Speaker 1>state side of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just,</v>

2375
02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:05.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not just veterans that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatized.</v>

2376
02:12:06.070 --> 02:12:07.950
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of people are sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ties.</v>

2377
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2378
02:12:08.950 --> 02:12:13.950
<v Speaker 1>everybody is traumatized with certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>extent just by living in this society.</v>

2379
02:12:14.561 --> 02:12:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are a wounded society.</v>

2380
02:12:16.990 --> 02:12:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing I think,</v>

2381
02:12:20.370 --> 02:12:23.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think psychedelics are medicines for,</v>

2382
02:12:23.610 --> 02:12:28.610
<v Speaker 1>for the soul in a sense and medicines </v>
<v Speaker 1>for our species in a certain sense.</v>

2383
02:12:30.751 --> 02:12:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why they're global,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2384
02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:38.200
<v Speaker 1>we're a wounded society and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's dysfunctionality is now </v>

2385
02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:39.010
<v Speaker 1>becoming a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2386
02:12:39.450 --> 02:12:42.240
<v Speaker 1>through the political situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2387
02:12:42.241 --> 02:12:46.450
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am just baffled by a,</v>

2388
02:12:46.660 --> 02:12:51.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a government of president who basically </v>

2389
02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:51.660
<v Speaker 1>likes to hurt people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

2390
02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:53.980
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this culture of cruelty,</v>

2391
02:12:54.010 --> 02:12:58.320
<v Speaker 1>cruelty that has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has been created and a,</v>

2392
02:12:58.570 --> 02:13:01.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly if he feels slighted,</v>

2393
02:13:02.100 --> 02:13:04.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to come back at you extra hard.</v>

2394
02:13:04.740 --> 02:13:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a reflection of probably of his</v>

2395
02:13:08.230 --> 02:13:09.680
<v Speaker 1>childhood trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2396
02:13:09.710 --> 02:13:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I think his father was very abusive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's,</v>

2397
02:13:12.790 --> 02:13:15.310
<v Speaker 1>it's his chance to get revenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2398
02:13:15.311 --> 02:13:17.300
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy.</v>

2399
02:13:17.650 --> 02:13:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

2400
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:22.510
<v Speaker 1>When you love to take him for a trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2401
02:13:22.511 --> 02:13:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it would do any good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

2402
02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:26.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it would do any good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

2403
02:13:27.310 --> 02:13:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't think there's a moral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's was a core there,</v>

2404
02:13:30.791 --> 02:13:31.830
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

2405
02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:32.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2406
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:35.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it would help him.</v>

2407
02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Karen,</v>

2408
02:13:37.220 --> 02:13:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Daryl enforced work most with said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>told me,</v>

2409
02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:42.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are two kinds of people I will not</v>

2410
02:13:42.451 --> 02:13:47.451
<v Speaker 2>give Iowasca to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is sociopath's and the other is </v>

2411
02:13:47.451 --> 02:13:49.790
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump is a sociopath.</v>

2412
02:13:50.300 --> 02:13:55.300
<v Speaker 2>He has no interior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's never had a reflective moment in </v>

2413
02:13:55.921 --> 02:13:58.890
<v Speaker 2>this life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what concerns me.</v>

2414
02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:01.210
<v Speaker 2>It's all external,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2415
02:14:01.260 --> 02:14:03.780
<v Speaker 2>he's like pure id,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2416
02:14:03.810 --> 02:14:06.360
<v Speaker 2>he is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a six year old,</v>

2417
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:08.100
<v Speaker 2>an angry.</v>

2418
02:14:09.210 --> 02:14:13.350
<v Speaker 3>If we met him at 16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you have hope for his future?</v>

2419
02:14:13.970 --> 02:14:14.790
<v Speaker 3>How do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2420
02:14:14.791 --> 02:14:17.760
<v Speaker 3>when as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond reproach or beyond help.</v>

2421
02:14:18.090 --> 02:14:19.410
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the year?</v>

2422
02:14:19.530 --> 02:14:24.530
<v Speaker 3>So we have this idea in our minds that </v>
<v Speaker 3>when a certain age is reached that a </v>

2423
02:14:24.530 --> 02:14:27.070
<v Speaker 3>person is just firmly established and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no more growth.</v>

2424
02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:27.800
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2425
02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:29.840
<v Speaker 3>You see someone who's a 60 year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>fool,</v>

2426
02:14:29.841 --> 02:14:34.841
<v Speaker 3>that's a dying fool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be a full till his last </v>

2427
02:14:34.841 --> 02:14:34.841
<v Speaker 3>day on this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that though?</v>

2428
02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.790
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we just assume that someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives a certain life?</v>

2429
02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:41.210
<v Speaker 3>Has a certain amount of time here that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to learn.</v>

2430
02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Is it just because of our own past </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences with these types of people </v>

2431
02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:47.990
<v Speaker 3>or are we imposing a limitation on their</v>
<v Speaker 3>growth?</v>

2432
02:14:48.770 --> 02:14:52.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm very curious about that because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>do do that.</v>

2433
02:14:52.491 --> 02:14:54.770
<v Speaker 3>We assume that if someone fucks up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're 20 will,</v>

2434
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:56.120
<v Speaker 3>they'll get better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>

2435
02:14:56.150 --> 02:14:58.850
<v Speaker 3>they're going to evolve if they fuck up </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're 70,</v>

2436
02:14:58.851 --> 02:15:00.050
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy's a goner.</v>

2437
02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we make that assumption,</v>

2438
02:15:02.990 --> 02:15:04.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it may not be true.</v>

2439
02:15:04.581 --> 02:15:05.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not fair.</v>

2440
02:15:05.361 --> 02:15:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the way it's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2441
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:10.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially now what we're learning.</v>

2442
02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that psychedelics do </v>

2443
02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:17.630
<v Speaker 2>that is a kind of a new thing that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning is neuroplasticity.</v>

2444
02:15:17.631 --> 02:15:22.631
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually reorganizes connections in </v>

2445
02:15:22.631 --> 02:15:22.850
<v Speaker 2>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2446
02:15:22.970 --> 02:15:26.730
<v Speaker 2>psilocybin does this and presumably the </v>
<v Speaker 2>others,</v>

2447
02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:29.700
<v Speaker 2>the others do to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the Fed means do it.</v>

2448
02:15:31.590 --> 02:15:33.400
<v Speaker 2>So that's a new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2449
02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:38.220
<v Speaker 2>you can actually change the conductivity</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the systems.</v>

2450
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:41.700
<v Speaker 2>That's probably not fair to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2451
02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:43.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend who came with me,</v>

2452
02:15:43.561 --> 02:15:48.561
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he made a point when we were discussing </v>

2453
02:15:48.561 --> 02:15:48.561
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

2454
02:15:48.561 --> 02:15:49.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't hate trump,</v>

2455
02:15:49.770 --> 02:15:51.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's used to that.</v>

2456
02:15:51.690 --> 02:15:54.510
<v Speaker 2>You should love trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2457
02:15:55.080 --> 02:16:00.080
<v Speaker 2>it's real hard for me to love trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the point that he's making </v>

2458
02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:04.731
<v Speaker 2>is that he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump is not the cause of it in some </v>

2459
02:16:04.731 --> 02:16:04.731
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the,</v>

2460
02:16:04.740 --> 02:16:07.740
<v Speaker 2>he's the symptom of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what's happening and he's,</v>

2461
02:16:07.860 --> 02:16:12.700
<v Speaker 2>he's the disruptor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the disruption is happening anyway.</v>

2462
02:16:12.701 --> 02:16:17.701
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so in some ways maybe we should be </v>

2463
02:16:17.701 --> 02:16:18.430
<v Speaker 2>grateful to trump because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's making,</v>

2464
02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:19.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2465
02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:21.850
<v Speaker 2>he's making it so in everybody's face </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2466
02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:25.910
<v Speaker 2>that people are questioning everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

2467
02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.580
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing because the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't last,</v>

2468
02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:35.600
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's gonna be a transition that's </v>

2469
02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:38.160
<v Speaker 3>going to be pretty rough and trump is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just part of that.</v>

2470
02:16:38.190 --> 02:16:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Not In any conscious way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's as much the victim of the Times as </v>

2471
02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:46.330
<v Speaker 3>anybody else and have expectation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has,</v>

2472
02:16:46.470 --> 02:16:49.530
<v Speaker 3>be president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has his finger on the nuclear button and</v>

2473
02:16:49.531 --> 02:16:54.000
<v Speaker 3>a few other inconvenient things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise he would just be dismissed.</v>

2474
02:16:54.001 --> 02:16:56.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an old cranky old guy.</v>

2475
02:16:57.230 --> 02:17:01.410
<v Speaker 3>The television was fun before this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

2476
02:17:01.411 --> 02:17:02.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2477
02:17:02.221 --> 02:17:04.140
<v Speaker 3>before this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was your fired.</v>

2478
02:17:04.141 --> 02:17:06.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the rich guy with his name on the</v>

2479
02:17:06.331 --> 02:17:09.360
<v Speaker 3>big buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a caricature.</v>

2480
02:17:09.900 --> 02:17:11.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't.</v>

2481
02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:15.420
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't what he is now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he is now is he's show.</v>

2482
02:17:15.450 --> 02:17:20.250
<v Speaker 3>He's exploited this vulnerability and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the political system that we essentially</v>

2483
02:17:20.251 --> 02:17:24.930
<v Speaker 3>a popularity contest that choose our </v>
<v Speaker 3>rulers and the idea of that and at first</v>

2484
02:17:24.931 --> 02:17:27.540
<v Speaker 3>was to pick the best one based on public</v>
<v Speaker 3>perception,</v>

2485
02:17:27.930 --> 02:17:29.790
<v Speaker 3>but that's not what it is anymore.</v>

2486
02:17:30.090 --> 02:17:35.090
<v Speaker 3>Now it's like we are so jaded as to how </v>
<v Speaker 3>well this system works and as to what </v>

2487
02:17:35.951 --> 02:17:40.740
<v Speaker 3>significant and important about it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we just want our guy to win.</v>

2488
02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.500
<v Speaker 3>Now it's our guy and Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary represented the bureaucrats.</v>

2489
02:17:45.501 --> 02:17:48.920
<v Speaker 3>She represented the red tape and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>career politicians,</v>

2490
02:17:48.921 --> 02:17:50.720
<v Speaker 3>the one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the proven liars,</v>

2491
02:17:50.721 --> 02:17:55.721
<v Speaker 3>the ones who were starting these Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 3>foundations and making hundreds of </v>

2492
02:17:55.721 --> 02:18:00.250
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars and giving these </v>
<v Speaker 3>speeches and making hundreds of </v>

2493
02:18:00.250 --> 02:18:02.411
<v Speaker 3>thousands of dollars talking to bankers </v>
<v Speaker 3>but won't release any of the </v>

2494
02:18:02.411 --> 02:18:02.570
<v Speaker 3>transcripts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And enough we've got to drain the swamp.</v>

2495
02:18:02.750 --> 02:18:06.080
<v Speaker 3>And this guy was our guy to drain the </v>
<v Speaker 3>swamp.</v>

2496
02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:07.850
<v Speaker 3>The private voted for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2497
02:18:07.851 --> 02:18:08.850
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um.</v>

2498
02:18:09.130 --> 02:18:14.130
<v Speaker 3>Then he came on and it turns out he is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the swamp is in escapable system is </v>

2499
02:18:14.331 --> 02:18:16.340
<v Speaker 3>completely broken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2500
02:18:16.341 --> 02:18:19.250
<v Speaker 3>I certainly don't think if we elected </v>
<v Speaker 3>hillary,</v>

2501
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:22.430
<v Speaker 2>it would all be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would still be a mess.</v>

2502
02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:27.460
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with trump is he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>immune to facts for one thing.</v>

2503
02:18:29.641 --> 02:18:30.290
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2504
02:18:30.300 --> 02:18:34.680
<v Speaker 2>the man is obviously diluted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly demented,</v>

2505
02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:37.560
<v Speaker 2>certainly a social path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2506
02:18:37.650 --> 02:18:40.350
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and very impulsive.</v>

2507
02:18:40.351 --> 02:18:41.770
<v Speaker 2>And this is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need,</v>

2508
02:18:42.030 --> 02:18:47.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not the person you need to be </v>

2509
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:49.140
<v Speaker 2>leading the western world because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he's not reflective,</v>

2510
02:18:49.141 --> 02:18:52.530
<v Speaker 2>he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all response.</v>

2511
02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:53.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

2512
02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:56.730
<v Speaker 2>this is the petula six year old aspect </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

2513
02:18:57.090 --> 02:18:59.640
<v Speaker 2>He sees something and he reacts </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

2514
02:18:59.641 --> 02:19:04.641
<v Speaker 2>There's no thought that intervenes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's often said that about his business </v>

2515
02:19:04.641 --> 02:19:05.220
<v Speaker 2>deals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't plan things.</v>

2516
02:19:05.490 --> 02:19:07.770
<v Speaker 2>He just goes into nozstock great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A businessman,</v>

2517
02:19:07.771 --> 02:19:10.470
<v Speaker 2>if you look back on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at his business deals,</v>

2518
02:19:10.471 --> 02:19:15.030
<v Speaker 2>that's the same with Korea thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if he can pull that off,</v>

2519
02:19:15.390 --> 02:19:20.390
<v Speaker 2>more power to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll bet you it's not going to go </v>

2520
02:19:20.390 --> 02:19:20.390
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

2521
02:19:21.070 --> 02:19:24.700
<v Speaker 2>you know Kim Shannon and the Chinese who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are behind it,</v>

2522
02:19:24.730 --> 02:19:26.830
<v Speaker 2>they are very smart and they.</v>

2523
02:19:27.610 --> 02:19:32.610
<v Speaker 1>They basically realized this guy is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>buffoon and they will be able to make a </v>

2524
02:19:32.610 --> 02:19:37.471
<v Speaker 1>show on the world stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they won't give up anything and </v>

2525
02:19:37.471 --> 02:19:39.820
<v Speaker 1>people are already saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he actually come away with?</v>

2526
02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some vague mumblings about </v>

2527
02:19:45.150 --> 02:19:45.150
<v Speaker 1>denuclearization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had that before,</v>

2528
02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:46.230
<v Speaker 1>but it was</v>

2529
02:19:46.270 --> 02:19:51.270
<v Speaker 3>unprecedented to see the leader of North</v>
<v Speaker 3>Korea and South Korea meet at the DMZ </v>

2530
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:53.590
<v Speaker 3>and shake hands and trap was traveled </v>
<v Speaker 3>that precedent.</v>

2531
02:19:53.591 --> 02:19:55.510
<v Speaker 3>That was pretty fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was pretty fast.</v>

2532
02:19:55.511 --> 02:20:00.511
<v Speaker 3>I think that's progress in some way and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe his lunacy needs leads to </v>

2533
02:20:00.511 --> 02:20:02.320
<v Speaker 3>inadvertent progress or advert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2534
02:20:02.321 --> 02:20:04.900
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2535
02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:08.400
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are many things.</v>

2536
02:20:08.820 --> 02:20:12.660
<v Speaker 3>He can't be entirely foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's probably a method to is matt,</v>

2537
02:20:12.661 --> 02:20:14.820
<v Speaker 3>he never lost all of his money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2538
02:20:14.821 --> 02:20:19.821
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he really hasn't been at least </v>

2539
02:20:19.821 --> 02:20:21.840
<v Speaker 3>marginally success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Success has gone bankrupt a few times,</v>

2540
02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:24.870
<v Speaker 3>but the point is that this is a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2541
02:20:24.900 --> 02:20:29.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's probably pretty complex as much as </v>

2542
02:20:29.900 --> 02:20:33.411
<v Speaker 3>he is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably also pretty complex and </v>

2543
02:20:33.411 --> 02:20:36.350
<v Speaker 3>some of that might benefit us because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have this fucked up system that's </v>

2544
02:20:36.350 --> 02:20:40.370
<v Speaker 3>undeniably fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says it's just a terrible idea </v>

2545
02:20:40.370 --> 02:20:43.701
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was a idea that was constructed </v>

2546
02:20:43.701 --> 02:20:47.120
<v Speaker 3>in 1776 when it made sense back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a great solution to the problems </v>

2547
02:20:47.910 --> 02:20:50.000
<v Speaker 3>of the times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we don't live in those times.</v>

2548
02:20:50.040 --> 02:20:51.460
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't live in those times.</v>

2549
02:20:51.730 --> 02:20:53.160
<v Speaker 3>Mainly complicated times.</v>

2550
02:20:54.390 --> 02:20:59.390
<v Speaker 1>And also we didn't have the media </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation that we have now.</v>

2551
02:20:59.461 --> 02:20:59.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2552
02:20:59.940 --> 02:21:02.270
<v Speaker 1>this is also part of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2553
02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:05.310
<v Speaker 1>with the social media and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

2554
02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:09.240
<v Speaker 1>There's puns of fake news out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced on both.</v>

2555
02:21:09.270 --> 02:21:14.270
<v Speaker 1>You cannot tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got the trump a reality </v>

2556
02:21:15.061 --> 02:21:16.830
<v Speaker 1>distortion field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2557
02:21:16.860 --> 02:21:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Which is reinforced by his really no </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretense about ignoring what's real,</v>

2558
02:21:24.491 --> 02:21:28.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this whole controversy about,</v>

2559
02:21:28.140 --> 02:21:31.200
<v Speaker 1>about the immigration and splitting up </v>
<v Speaker 1>families and say,</v>

2560
02:21:31.201 --> 02:21:33.690
<v Speaker 1>well we're just enforcing the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in fact,</v>

2561
02:21:34.020 --> 02:21:39.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the stroke of a pen he could change </v>

2562
02:21:39.020 --> 02:21:39.360
<v Speaker 1>that and we didn't enforce that way </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

2563
02:21:39.361 --> 02:21:41.190
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's changed that,</v>

2564
02:21:41.220 --> 02:21:41.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2565
02:21:42.390 --> 02:21:44.430
<v Speaker 3>just changed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just caved in and now he's,</v>

2566
02:21:44.500 --> 02:21:47.550
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he supposedly.</v>

2567
02:21:47.600 --> 02:21:50.070
<v Speaker 3>But it's nice at least that he's doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2568
02:21:50.130 --> 02:21:55.130
<v Speaker 3>like listening to public opinion in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outcries reached him and he's reacted </v>

2569
02:21:55.130 --> 02:21:55.290
<v Speaker 3>yell,</v>

2570
02:21:56.470 --> 02:22:01.470
<v Speaker 1>but this is my car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that he cares about these </v>

2571
02:22:01.470 --> 02:22:01.470
<v Speaker 1>children or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

2572
02:22:01.470 --> 02:22:05.380
<v Speaker 1>how many people has he already </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatized as a result of this?</v>

2573
02:22:05.381 --> 02:22:06.050
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2574
02:22:06.070 --> 02:22:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad that he changed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure that was a cynical </v>

2575
02:22:11.070 --> 02:22:11.070
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has Advisors said,</v>

2576
02:22:11.071 --> 02:22:12.210
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look Donald,</v>

2577
02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:14.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're about to go to a.</v>

2578
02:22:14.300 --> 02:22:19.300
<v Speaker 1>you're about to go to a rally in Duluth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I honestly think it's coming from </v>

2579
02:22:19.300 --> 02:22:20.160
<v Speaker 1>certain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not gonna like this.</v>

2580
02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:25.760
<v Speaker 1>I think it's coming from his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this going around to this a jacket </v>

2581
02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:25.760
<v Speaker 1>she wore to a</v>

2582
02:22:25.970 --> 02:22:26.880
<v Speaker 3>uh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2583
02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:29.490
<v Speaker 3>what she say it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't care.</v>

2584
02:22:29.491 --> 02:22:30.460
<v Speaker 3>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2585
02:22:30.660 --> 02:22:33.480
<v Speaker 3>and this was a meeting of diy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like immigration.</v>

2586
02:22:33.730 --> 02:22:34.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kids.</v>

2587
02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:35.710
<v Speaker 3>She's been the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2588
02:22:36.100 --> 02:22:37.090
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>

2589
02:22:37.091 --> 02:22:40.600
<v Speaker 3>But is that in some fashion jacket that </v>
<v Speaker 3>she wore to that event?</v>

2590
02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:44.140
<v Speaker 3>What a stupid fucking thing to where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>really don't care.</v>

2591
02:22:44.141 --> 02:22:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2592
02:22:47.410 --> 02:22:49.150
<v Speaker 3>I do care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what are you talking about?</v>

2593
02:22:49.710 --> 02:22:52.120
<v Speaker 3>What a bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open ended question.</v>

2594
02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:56.590
<v Speaker 3>I really don't care about the tone </v>
<v Speaker 3>deafness of these people.</v>

2595
02:22:56.710 --> 02:23:01.710
<v Speaker 3>They know sensitivity critic though of </v>
<v Speaker 3>separating children from their families </v>

2596
02:23:03.130 --> 02:23:08.130
<v Speaker 3>and she actually made a surprise visit </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the Mexican border today to check on </v>

2597
02:23:08.130 --> 02:23:08.890
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See what's going on.</v>

2598
02:23:09.130 --> 02:23:10.250
<v Speaker 3>Good for her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

2599
02:23:10.370 --> 02:23:11.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's an immigrant.</v>

2600
02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:13.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is the irony of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2601
02:23:13.211 --> 02:23:18.211
<v Speaker 3>She barely speaks English.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is so bizarre is that </v>

2602
02:23:18.211 --> 02:23:22.081
<v Speaker 3>his own wife is a fucking immigrant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean clearly the whole thing is crazy.</v>

2603
02:23:22.421 --> 02:23:24.580
<v Speaker 3>It's really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that jacket,</v>

2604
02:23:25.790 --> 02:23:30.790
<v Speaker 3>this what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the sign of the simulation if </v>

2605
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.790
<v Speaker 3>you considered the simulation theory.</v>

2606
02:23:31.020 --> 02:23:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2607
02:23:32.330 --> 02:23:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Real real might be real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean sometimes I do wonder.</v>

2608
02:23:37.711 --> 02:23:42.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like it's like reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever we choose to call it is </v>

2609
02:23:42.711 --> 02:23:46.910
<v Speaker 1>becoming so weird that I often ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

2610
02:23:46.911 --> 02:23:51.170
<v Speaker 1>who is writing this shit and can't they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a better writer?</v>

2611
02:23:51.290 --> 02:23:51.910
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2612
02:23:51.980 --> 02:23:54.890
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so absurd.</v>

2613
02:23:54.891 --> 02:23:59.891
<v Speaker 1>And yet I began actively considering it </v>
<v Speaker 1>when congressmen wiener kept pulling his</v>

2614
02:24:00.081 --> 02:24:01.700
<v Speaker 1>dick out this,</v>

2615
02:24:02.410 --> 02:24:05.780
<v Speaker 3>it's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy.</v>

2616
02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:07.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is too much.</v>

2617
02:24:07.701 --> 02:24:10.430
<v Speaker 3>And then when trump won,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just was sitting down going,</v>

2618
02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:16.120
<v Speaker 3>imagine if we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one day someone shuts it off and the </v>

2619
02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:17.960
<v Speaker 3>lights dim and then they turned back on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you realize,</v>

2620
02:24:17.961 --> 02:24:19.280
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the game's over.</v>

2621
02:24:19.310 --> 02:24:20.510
<v Speaker 3>How did you like it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

2622
02:24:20.511 --> 02:24:22.520
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was fake.</v>

2623
02:24:22.521 --> 02:24:23.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2624
02:24:23.181 --> 02:24:26.060
<v Speaker 3>you just went and it only took an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long did it seem?</v>

2625
02:24:26.061 --> 02:24:28.140
<v Speaker 3>Like 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2626
02:24:28.141 --> 02:24:29.030
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2627
02:24:29.070 --> 02:24:34.070
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a simulation with artificial </v>

2628
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.870
<v Speaker 3>memories implanted into your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2629
02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:39.880
<v Speaker 3>the one day that the idea that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be an artificial reality or </v>

2630
02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:43.961
<v Speaker 3>virtual reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so good that it's </v>

2631
02:24:43.961 --> 02:24:43.961
<v Speaker 3>indistinguishable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2632
02:24:43.961 --> 02:24:47.501
<v Speaker 3>this is almost inevitable if technology </v>
<v Speaker 3>increases at the same rate that it's </v>

2633
02:24:47.501 --> 02:24:51.671
<v Speaker 3>increasing now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's two years from now or 100 </v>

2634
02:24:51.671 --> 02:24:51.671
<v Speaker 3>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to reach some point in time.</v>

2635
02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:53.360
<v Speaker 3>So the real question is</v>

2636
02:24:53.470 --> 02:24:55.450
<v Speaker 1>when we do reach that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how will we know?</v>

2637
02:24:56.290 --> 02:25:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if we're already there for the use </v>

2638
02:25:01.290 --> 02:25:02.080
<v Speaker 1>of simulation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would we know and how we test it.</v>

2639
02:25:02.590 --> 02:25:04.260
<v Speaker 1>We test it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you.</v>

2640
02:25:04.330 --> 02:25:09.330
<v Speaker 1>But another aspect of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we really want this?</v>

2641
02:25:09.510 --> 02:25:10.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I mean,</v>

2642
02:25:10.690 --> 02:25:14.080
<v Speaker 1>do we want to be immersed in a virtual </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality?</v>

2643
02:25:14.110 --> 02:25:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Even if we could produce one so </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated,</v>

2644
02:25:17.710 --> 02:25:21.520
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't tell it from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from whatever this is,</v>

2645
02:25:21.521 --> 02:25:26.521
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's assume for the moment this is </v>

2646
02:25:26.521 --> 02:25:26.521
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stops it.</v>

2647
02:25:26.521 --> 02:25:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Do we want to migrate into a virtual </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality?</v>

2648
02:25:28.650 --> 02:25:33.650
<v Speaker 3>My concern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my real concern is that we are the last </v>

2649
02:25:33.650 --> 02:25:33.650
<v Speaker 3>wave of the biological human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2650
02:25:33.650 --> 02:25:34.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really,</v>

2651
02:25:34.470 --> 02:25:35.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really do believe this.</v>

2652
02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:38.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm concerned about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

2653
02:25:38.191 --> 02:25:43.191
<v Speaker 3>I think that that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily think it's a good </v>

2654
02:25:43.191 --> 02:25:43.690
<v Speaker 3>thing for the biological human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

2655
02:25:43.710 --> 02:25:48.710
<v Speaker 3>I feel like if you separate yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the idea of good and bad in the </v>

2656
02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:50.040
<v Speaker 3>inevitability of innovation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>progress,</v>

2657
02:25:50.940 --> 02:25:55.770
<v Speaker 3>it's human beings continue to make more </v>
<v Speaker 3>and more complex electronics with higher</v>

2658
02:25:55.771 --> 02:25:59.880
<v Speaker 3>and higher capabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's inevitable that we become symbiotic</v>

2659
02:25:59.881 --> 02:26:02.280
<v Speaker 3>with these things that we ingrain them </v>
<v Speaker 3>into our.</v>

2660
02:26:03.010 --> 02:26:05.040
<v Speaker 3>They're going to become a part of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

2661
02:26:05.310 --> 02:26:09.840
<v Speaker 3>We're going to replace body parts with </v>
<v Speaker 3>more efficient body parts and we are one</v>

2662
02:26:09.841 --> 02:26:12.810
<v Speaker 3>day going to create some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial life.</v>

2663
02:26:12.811 --> 02:26:15.570
<v Speaker 3>Now whether we become a part of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial life,</v>

2664
02:26:15.670 --> 02:26:20.670
<v Speaker 3>we merged with it or it just assumes the</v>
<v Speaker 3>role of the leader of the earth.</v>

2665
02:26:22.380 --> 02:26:25.800
<v Speaker 3>One of those things is likely to happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>within the next 500 years.</v>

2666
02:26:25.801 --> 02:26:27.030
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

2667
02:26:27.060 --> 02:26:29.820
<v Speaker 3>that's a really generous timeframe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's</v>

2668
02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.540
<v Speaker 1>generous timeframe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2669
02:26:31.620 --> 02:26:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>

2670
02:26:32.551 --> 02:26:34.710
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2671
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:39.950
<v Speaker 1>in some ways this is sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This raises the issue about,</v>

2672
02:26:40.881 --> 02:26:45.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that psychedelics put </v>

2673
02:26:45.881 --> 02:26:48.281
<v Speaker 1>in front of us front and center is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that we are getting a strange from </v>

2674
02:26:48.281 --> 02:26:48.770
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2675
02:26:48.860 --> 02:26:52.220
<v Speaker 1>that's the main lesson were getting this</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange from nature.</v>

2676
02:26:52.221 --> 02:26:54.850
<v Speaker 1>We have to really understand our </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship and,</v>

2677
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:56.230
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2678
02:26:56.270 --> 02:27:01.270
<v Speaker 1>become a partner that's in the symbiosis</v>
<v Speaker 1>with nature and this projection is the </v>

2679
02:27:04.361 --> 02:27:06.910
<v Speaker 1>exact opposite of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is that,</v>

2680
02:27:06.940 --> 02:27:08.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you know,</v>

2681
02:27:09.290 --> 02:27:14.290
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this raises also in one issue that we </v>

2682
02:27:14.290 --> 02:27:14.380
<v Speaker 1>haven't really touched on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here,</v>

2683
02:27:14.410 --> 02:27:18.240
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

2684
02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:23.360
<v Speaker 1>which is what this virtual reality stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>is and what any artifact is psychedelics</v>

2685
02:27:24.361 --> 02:27:27.630
<v Speaker 1>or technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Molecular biology is technology.</v>

2686
02:27:27.631 --> 02:27:32.631
<v Speaker 1>Cybernetics as technology technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>inherently has no moral dimension.</v>

2687
02:27:33.950 --> 02:27:37.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are not good or bad things,</v>

2688
02:27:37.130 --> 02:27:40.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that they are used by humans,</v>

2689
02:27:40.381 --> 02:27:45.381
<v Speaker 1>the decisions that humans make in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that they're going to exploit or </v>

2690
02:27:45.381 --> 02:27:47.030
<v Speaker 1>deploy these technologies.</v>

2691
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:49.400
<v Speaker 1>That's where the moral dimension comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

2692
02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Morality comes out of the human heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2693
02:27:53.690 --> 02:27:57.590
<v Speaker 1>and we are one of our problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel as a species.</v>

2694
02:27:57.591 --> 02:28:01.010
<v Speaker 1>We're extremely clever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not wise.</v>

2695
02:28:01.810 --> 02:28:05.740
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not wise about what we do.</v>

2696
02:28:05.741 --> 02:28:08.890
<v Speaker 1>We're not able to step back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2697
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:10.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can produce,</v>

2698
02:28:10.031 --> 02:28:11.000
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2699
02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:16.120
<v Speaker 1>download the brain into cybernetics or </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can produce an artificial body or we </v>

2700
02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:20.771
<v Speaker 1>can do all this genetic stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we ever stopped to think about just </v>

2701
02:28:20.771 --> 02:28:23.300
<v Speaker 1>because we can something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we do something,</v>

2702
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:24.540
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2703
02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:25.220
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2704
02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:27.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the arrogance of science.</v>

2705
02:28:27.591 --> 02:28:30.500
<v Speaker 1>This is also a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scientists will say,</v>

2706
02:28:30.501 --> 02:28:32.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are scientists,</v>

2707
02:28:32.851 --> 02:28:34.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can do it.</v>

2708
02:28:34.050 --> 02:28:39.050
<v Speaker 1>So let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can do the Hadron experiment and </v>

2709
02:28:40.190 --> 02:28:42.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe it'll collapse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsed the space time continuum,</v>

2710
02:28:42.570 --> 02:28:44.340
<v Speaker 1>but the very small probability.</v>

2711
02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:46.470
<v Speaker 1>So let's do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2712
02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something we have to learn.</v>

2713
02:28:49.531 --> 02:28:52.840
<v Speaker 1>I think also the psychedelics are </v>
<v Speaker 1>important in that regard too.</v>

2714
02:28:53.010 --> 02:28:58.010
<v Speaker 1>They are ways that we can bring our </v>
<v Speaker 1>cleverness and our wisdom into sync so </v>

2715
02:28:59.611 --> 02:29:04.611
<v Speaker 1>that we have the wisdom not to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something even though we might be able </v>

2716
02:29:05.881 --> 02:29:10.881
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't do it just because we can </v>

2717
02:29:10.881 --> 02:29:10.881
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2718
02:29:10.881 --> 02:29:13.290
<v Speaker 1>we really have to as a species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask ourselves is this a good idea?</v>

2719
02:29:14.040 --> 02:29:19.040
<v Speaker 1>And I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these psychedelics are teaching tools </v>

2720
02:29:20.531 --> 02:29:24.420
<v Speaker 1>for learning this and really propagating</v>
<v Speaker 1>the message from the</v>

2721
02:29:24.540 --> 02:29:26.970
<v Speaker 3>community of species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>

2722
02:29:26.971 --> 02:29:31.971
<v Speaker 3>Going to be a meme with a photo of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>face that we are very clever but we're </v>

2723
02:29:31.971 --> 02:29:32.430
<v Speaker 3>not wise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>

2724
02:29:32.431 --> 02:29:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Going to be a meme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some,</v>

2725
02:29:33.540 --> 02:29:36.570
<v Speaker 3>some dude or gal is working on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

2726
02:29:36.780 --> 02:29:41.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been talking about this sentence </v>

2727
02:29:41.780 --> 02:29:46.050
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so striking not my real concern with </v>

2728
02:29:46.050 --> 02:29:50.181
<v Speaker 3>this stuff is that this is inevitable </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is just like the single celled </v>

2729
02:29:50.181 --> 02:29:52.920
<v Speaker 3>organism became the multicell organism </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that the thinking,</v>

2730
02:29:53.070 --> 02:29:58.070
<v Speaker 3>curious monkey who strives for material </v>
<v Speaker 3>possessions is designed to create </v>

2731
02:29:58.070 --> 02:30:01.110
<v Speaker 3>artificial life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is just what we've said here.</v>

2732
02:30:01.111 --> 02:30:06.111
<v Speaker 3>I've described it as that we are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>technological butterfly that will emerge</v>

2733
02:30:08.101 --> 02:30:13.101
<v Speaker 3>from the cocoon and right now we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>creating this cocoon that we are this </v>

2734
02:30:13.101 --> 02:30:13.500
<v Speaker 3>caterpillar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2735
02:30:13.680 --> 02:30:18.680
<v Speaker 3>technological caterpillar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we don't know why we're making this </v>

2736
02:30:18.680 --> 02:30:18.680
<v Speaker 3>cocoon and that we are going to give </v>
<v Speaker 3>birth,</v>

2737
02:30:18.680 --> 02:30:23.571
<v Speaker 3>this artificial life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this next stage of complexity that may </v>

2738
02:30:23.971 --> 02:30:24.440
<v Speaker 3>be true</v>

2739
02:30:24.480 --> 02:30:25.320
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2740
02:30:25.350 --> 02:30:26.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you say is true.</v>

2741
02:30:27.700 --> 02:30:29.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on some level,</v>

2742
02:30:29.430 --> 02:30:32.980
<v Speaker 1>anything that can be done is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb.</v>

2743
02:30:33.150 --> 02:30:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Somebody's gonna do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so,</v>

2744
02:30:36.970 --> 02:30:39.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it good?</v>

2745
02:30:40.340 --> 02:30:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Is it good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it good for the collective?</v>

2746
02:30:43.541 --> 02:30:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2747
02:30:44.471 --> 02:30:46.930
<v Speaker 1>they're always megalomaniacs will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2748
02:30:47.120 --> 02:30:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can start a nuclear war,</v>

2749
02:30:49.331 --> 02:30:51.550
<v Speaker 1>so why don't we do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2750
02:30:53.070 --> 02:30:54.560
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the tricky part.</v>

2751
02:30:54.561 --> 02:30:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2752
02:30:55.550 --> 02:31:00.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics are important in giving us </v>

2753
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.590
<v Speaker 1>a moral compass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2754
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:05.950
<v Speaker 1>wisdom not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a set of rules about that come out </v>

2755
02:31:08.001 --> 02:31:13.001
<v Speaker 1>of the religious perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A set of rules that come out of the </v>

2756
02:31:13.001 --> 02:31:14.600
<v Speaker 1>biological perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is most compatible?</v>

2757
02:31:14.601 --> 02:31:17.450
<v Speaker 1>What is most nourishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nourishing for living?</v>

2758
02:31:17.451 --> 02:31:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Things presumably don't want to trash </v>
<v Speaker 1>this planet.</v>

2759
02:31:22.010 --> 02:31:24.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we now have the ability to do that,</v>

2760
02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:29.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forces that we can manipulate for </v>

2761
02:31:29.600 --> 02:31:33.391
<v Speaker 1>the first time in history pose a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility that we could and life on </v>

2762
02:31:33.391 --> 02:31:37.000
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hard,</v>

2763
02:31:37.150 --> 02:31:40.600
<v Speaker 1>but I think we may be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I for one,</v>

2764
02:31:40.630 --> 02:31:41.890
<v Speaker 1>don't want to see that happen.</v>

2765
02:31:42.210 --> 02:31:47.210
<v Speaker 3>I had a bit a few years back in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy act about the origins of the </v>

2766
02:31:47.521 --> 02:31:52.521
<v Speaker 3>universe and that what happens is people</v>
<v Speaker 3>get so smart that they develop a big </v>

2767
02:31:52.521 --> 02:31:56.961
<v Speaker 3>bang machine and that someone's sitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and some guy who's on the autism </v>

2768
02:31:56.961 --> 02:32:01.641
<v Speaker 3>spectrum was filled up with SSRI </v>
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants and drinking red bull </v>

2769
02:32:01.641 --> 02:32:02.640
<v Speaker 3>all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just goes,</v>

2770
02:32:02.641 --> 02:32:04.890
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll press it and he hits the button and</v>

2771
02:32:04.891 --> 02:32:06.930
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we start from scratch and then every,</v>

2772
02:32:07.340 --> 02:32:09.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>14 plus billion years,</v>

2773
02:32:10.010 --> 02:32:15.010
<v Speaker 3>someone develops the big bang machine </v>
<v Speaker 3>and hits it and that's the restart of </v>

2774
02:32:15.010 --> 02:32:19.280
<v Speaker 3>the universe over and over with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of the universal simulation.</v>

2775
02:32:19.470 --> 02:32:20.840
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>

2776
02:32:20.841 --> 02:32:23.000
<v Speaker 3>In some ways it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2777
02:32:23.001 --> 02:32:24.170
<v Speaker 3>it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

2778
02:32:24.171 --> 02:32:29.171
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's inevitable that there will be </v>

2779
02:32:29.171 --> 02:32:29.171
<v Speaker 3>simulated worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2780
02:32:29.171 --> 02:32:34.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm not necessarily completely obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the idea that we're living in a </v>

2781
02:32:34.110 --> 02:32:36.170
<v Speaker 3>simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I am completely obsessed that we are</v>

2782
02:32:36.530 --> 02:32:40.340
<v Speaker 3>a relic and that we are on our way out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really am.</v>

2783
02:32:40.400 --> 02:32:43.310
<v Speaker 3>I really do think that maybe that's one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the reasons why we're so crazy and so</v>

2784
02:32:43.311 --> 02:32:44.330
<v Speaker 3>haywire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just shows.</v>

2785
02:32:44.540 --> 02:32:48.920
<v Speaker 3>There's no logical progression for our </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture that it's as advanced as we are,</v>

2786
02:32:48.921 --> 02:32:51.230
<v Speaker 3>as much access to information as we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

2787
02:32:51.410 --> 02:32:53.330
<v Speaker 3>We're also as crazy as we have ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>been,</v>

2788
02:32:53.331 --> 02:32:54.650
<v Speaker 3>if not crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2789
02:32:55.110 --> 02:33:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the age of low curious monkey is </v>

2790
02:33:00.110 --> 02:33:00.110
<v Speaker 1>coming to a close</v>

2791
02:33:00.110 --> 02:33:02.570
<v Speaker 3>wonder how much of a limitation our </v>
<v Speaker 3>biology is too.</v>

2792
02:33:02.571 --> 02:33:07.571
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think about what it took to get to </v>

2793
02:33:07.571 --> 02:33:10.091
<v Speaker 3>here and all the battles we had to fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the animals we had to run from and </v>

2794
02:33:10.091 --> 02:33:13.700
<v Speaker 3>all these human reward systems that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>ingrained into our DNA and that now here</v>

2795
02:33:13.701 --> 02:33:18.701
<v Speaker 3>we are in a place where we hardly need </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and yet we still have them just </v>

2796
02:33:18.701 --> 02:33:23.560
<v Speaker 3>blowing up and exploding and vomiting </v>
<v Speaker 3>all over the place and these weird ways </v>

2797
02:33:23.560 --> 02:33:27.881
<v Speaker 3>and we have them sort of manifesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves in very strange behaviors </v>

2798
02:33:27.890 --> 02:33:32.890
<v Speaker 3>that aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't good for anybody and this </v>

2799
02:33:32.890 --> 02:33:35.000
<v Speaker 3>constant need to acquire material </v>
<v Speaker 3>possessions and conquer and and,</v>

2800
02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:38.930
<v Speaker 3>and obtain things at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

2801
02:33:38.931 --> 02:33:43.931
<v Speaker 3>this is not tenable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not something that makes sense </v>

2802
02:33:43.931 --> 02:33:46.421
<v Speaker 3>in the long haul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet we still go down this illogical </v>

2803
02:33:46.421 --> 02:33:49.631
<v Speaker 3>road and that this is really just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because this is the best way to fuel </v>

2804
02:33:49.631 --> 02:33:54.611
<v Speaker 3>innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are extreme desire for material </v>

2805
02:33:54.611 --> 02:33:57.311
<v Speaker 3>possessions is the best way to ensure </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're gonna keep coming up with </v>

2806
02:33:57.311 --> 02:34:00.521
<v Speaker 3>newer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better things every year which will </v>

2807
02:34:00.521 --> 02:34:00.860
<v Speaker 3>eventually give birth to the electronic </v>
<v Speaker 3>butterfly.</v>

2808
02:34:03.430 --> 02:34:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to say about it.</v>

2809
02:34:05.540 --> 02:34:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean it may be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That may be where we're,</v>

2810
02:34:08.800 --> 02:34:13.800
<v Speaker 1>where we're headed and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be that this isn't necessary to.</v>

2811
02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:22.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if our destiny is to actually leave the </v>

2812
02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:23.970
<v Speaker 1>earth at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2813
02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:29.000
<v Speaker 1>if the earth is an incubator for life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're just destined to leave it and </v>

2814
02:34:31.391 --> 02:34:35.680
<v Speaker 1>spread out into the galaxy and beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

2815
02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:40.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe this is inevitable that we </v>

2816
02:34:40.740 --> 02:34:41.800
<v Speaker 1>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have to do that if that's what's</v>

2817
02:34:41.801 --> 02:34:46.801
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the question is what kind of being </v>

2818
02:34:46.801 --> 02:34:47.710
<v Speaker 1>will we be when we do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2819
02:34:47.770 --> 02:34:52.770
<v Speaker 1>we won't be human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be something different than </v>

2820
02:34:52.770 --> 02:34:52.770
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>

2821
02:34:52.770 --> 02:34:54.630
<v Speaker 3>That's what I've always wondered about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the alien archetype,</v>

2822
02:34:54.900 --> 02:34:58.620
<v Speaker 3>that big headed thing with the no </v>
<v Speaker 3>genitals and no mouth.</v>

2823
02:34:58.660 --> 02:35:03.660
<v Speaker 3>That may be what we think of as being </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate form that the human animal </v>

2824
02:35:04.531 --> 02:35:06.750
<v Speaker 3>tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If when we do,</v>

2825
02:35:07.140 --> 02:35:10.890
<v Speaker 3>if we do symbiotically merged with </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology and electronics at that might</v>

2826
02:35:10.891 --> 02:35:15.891
<v Speaker 3>be the form that we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so strange at that one </v>

2827
02:35:15.891 --> 02:35:16.290
<v Speaker 3>excepted form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've heard,</v>

2828
02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:22.520
<v Speaker 3>I've heard the idea that this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this image is something when young eyes </v>

2829
02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:26.991
<v Speaker 3>from a newborn baby sees a doctor and </v>
<v Speaker 3>see the doctor with the mask and the </v>

2830
02:35:27.710 --> 02:35:32.710
<v Speaker 3>face and this is what they see and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is imprinted in our mind,</v>

2831
02:35:32.761 --> 02:35:37.761
<v Speaker 3>this traumatic experience of the birth </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the bright lights and the operating </v>

2832
02:35:37.761 --> 02:35:41.091
<v Speaker 3>table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why so many of these alien </v>

2833
02:35:41.091 --> 02:35:44.541
<v Speaker 3>abduction experiences do take place in </v>
<v Speaker 3>these very clinic clinical sterile </v>

2834
02:35:44.591 --> 02:35:49.591
<v Speaker 3>environments and it seems like a medical</v>
<v Speaker 3>procedure as if this is a remnant of the</v>

2835
02:35:49.691 --> 02:35:50.740
<v Speaker 3>birth process.</v>

2836
02:35:51.160 --> 02:35:53.740
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that explanation,</v>

2837
02:35:54.160 --> 02:35:58.500
<v Speaker 3>but it also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It strikes me that these things are.</v>

2838
02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:03.220
<v Speaker 3>There you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go from ancient hominids,</v>

2839
02:36:03.250 --> 02:36:04.630
<v Speaker 3>you go from Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pythagoras,</v>

2840
02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:09.780
<v Speaker 3>and then you go to a modern computer </v>
<v Speaker 3>programmer who doesn't exercise and you </v>

2841
02:36:10.871 --> 02:36:15.871
<v Speaker 3>look at their body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This sort of like doughy thin bodied.</v>

2842
02:36:16.031 --> 02:36:21.031
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't move very well and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>go back to this muscular apelike </v>

2843
02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:25.300
<v Speaker 3>creature that's covered in hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've lost all the hair,</v>

2844
02:36:25.301 --> 02:36:30.301
<v Speaker 3>they've lost all the muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They become thin and then where's that </v>

2845
02:36:30.301 --> 02:36:30.301
<v Speaker 3>going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2846
02:36:30.301 --> 02:36:30.820
<v Speaker 3>it's obviously going in that same </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

2847
02:36:30.821 --> 02:36:35.821
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are not going to get more </v>

2848
02:36:35.821 --> 02:36:37.030
<v Speaker 3>muscular and harder and hairier as time </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes on unless something radical changes</v>

2849
02:36:37.031 --> 02:36:38.580
<v Speaker 3>and we need to adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2850
02:36:38.590 --> 02:36:41.800
<v Speaker 3>So that would be the normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the path would.</v>

2851
02:36:41.860 --> 02:36:46.860
<v Speaker 3>That would be the natural progression </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we would eventually have bigger </v>

2852
02:36:46.860 --> 02:36:47.950
<v Speaker 3>heads because we have bigger heads in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>

2853
02:36:47.951 --> 02:36:50.190
<v Speaker 3>pithy kiss and certainly bigger heads </v>
<v Speaker 3>than chimps are,</v>

2854
02:36:50.410 --> 02:36:55.410
<v Speaker 3>but no elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just keeps going in that same </v>

2855
02:36:55.410 --> 02:36:55.410
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

2856
02:36:55.410 --> 02:36:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.</v>

2857
02:36:56.630 --> 02:37:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe we just leave the biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>shell behind,</v>

2858
02:37:00.570 --> 02:37:05.570
<v Speaker 1>but then whereas I'm really shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what do we are transhuman and we.</v>

2859
02:37:07.980 --> 02:37:08.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2860
02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:12.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure I want to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I want to go there,</v>

2861
02:37:12.690 --> 02:37:13.140
<v Speaker 3>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

2862
02:37:13.150 --> 02:37:18.150
<v Speaker 3>But I'm thinking is like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it that's making me clean to </v>

2863
02:37:18.150 --> 02:37:18.920
<v Speaker 3>these ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it that I love emotions.</v>

2864
02:37:19.250 --> 02:37:21.560
<v Speaker 3>I love illogical behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I love art?</v>

2865
02:37:21.580 --> 02:37:22.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love all those things.</v>

2866
02:37:22.850 --> 02:37:27.850
<v Speaker 3>I love music and food and all the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that cooking and all the things that </v>

2867
02:37:27.850 --> 02:37:32.020
<v Speaker 3>make a person a person camaraderie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what are those things are those </v>

2868
02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:37.120
<v Speaker 3>chemical reactions we have with other </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings and natural reward systems that </v>

2869
02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:40.961
<v Speaker 3>are built in to sort of enhanced </v>
<v Speaker 3>community and comradery so that we can </v>

2870
02:37:40.961 --> 02:37:44.461
<v Speaker 3>stay together so the species survives </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like what if there's something that </v>

2871
02:37:44.461 --> 02:37:48.221
<v Speaker 3>supplants that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if there's something that far </v>

2872
02:37:48.221 --> 02:37:49.931
<v Speaker 3>surpasses that in terms of pleasure and </v>
<v Speaker 3>connectivity and we realized that </v>

2873
02:37:49.931 --> 02:37:54.250
<v Speaker 3>emotions are just these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these ancient systems that were put into</v>

2874
02:37:54.251 --> 02:37:57.640
<v Speaker 3>place when there wasn't a better option </v>
<v Speaker 3>with these better options.</v>

2875
02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:02.640
<v Speaker 3>It's much better to get your food from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>supermarket than it is to chase down a </v>

2876
02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:04.890
<v Speaker 3>gazelle for two days until it dies of </v>
<v Speaker 3>heatstroke.</v>

2877
02:38:05.390 --> 02:38:06.250
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>

2878
02:38:06.270 --> 02:38:09.780
<v Speaker 3>these systems improve over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2879
02:38:09.850 --> 02:38:10.580
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2880
02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:14.560
<v Speaker 3>this animal that we are now is very </v>
<v Speaker 3>different than the animal we used to be.</v>

2881
02:38:14.770 --> 02:38:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Why do we want to stay in this imperfect</v>
<v Speaker 3>state that seems even more ridiculous,</v>

2882
02:38:18.461 --> 02:38:21.610
<v Speaker 3>that would like to stay humans forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humans are so flawed.</v>

2883
02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:26.840
<v Speaker 3>We have been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why we have all this </v>

2884
02:38:26.840 --> 02:38:28.990
<v Speaker 3>nonsense in the world and our society is</v>
<v Speaker 3>sick and we are twisted and confused,</v>

2885
02:38:29.070 --> 02:38:34.070
<v Speaker 3>but a part of it at least has to be that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human animal itself is very flawed </v>

2886
02:38:35.260 --> 02:38:40.260
<v Speaker 3>because there's no perfect culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just chalk it up to culture </v>

2887
02:38:40.260 --> 02:38:40.540
<v Speaker 3>because if you did chalk it up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

2888
02:38:40.541 --> 02:38:41.350
<v Speaker 3>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2889
02:38:41.351 --> 02:38:43.960
<v Speaker 3>this culture sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you go to this culture,</v>

2890
02:38:43.961 --> 02:38:45.490
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no crime.</v>

2891
02:38:45.491 --> 02:38:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Everyone loves everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's completely open.</v>

2892
02:38:48.130 --> 02:38:53.130
<v Speaker 3>There's no need to worry about money </v>
<v Speaker 3>because everybody's generous and and </v>

2893
02:38:53.130 --> 02:38:56.540
<v Speaker 3>everything gets and they're really </v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant and they get along and they </v>

2894
02:38:56.540 --> 02:38:57.280
<v Speaker 3>create new architecture and everything's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fantastic.</v>

2895
02:38:57.430 --> 02:38:59.530
<v Speaker 3>It's the perfect society that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>exist,</v>

2896
02:38:59.990 --> 02:39:04.450
<v Speaker 1>but is that the culture that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>create with the help of psychedelics?</v>

2897
02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Is that what we're shooting for now or </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans truly humanistic culture where </v>

2898
02:39:11.201 --> 02:39:16.201
<v Speaker 1>people were love is what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's driven by love,</v>

2899
02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:20.530
<v Speaker 1>not by hatred and rivalry and scarcity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fear,</v>

2900
02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:23.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the whole thing.</v>

2901
02:39:23.711 --> 02:39:28.711
<v Speaker 1>The psychedelics can be the catalyst </v>
<v Speaker 1>that teaches us how to love ourselves,</v>

2902
02:39:29.140 --> 02:39:31.270
<v Speaker 1>how to love each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the earth,</v>

2903
02:39:31.271 --> 02:39:34.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that sounds cliche and trivial,</v>

2904
02:39:34.961 --> 02:39:39.961
<v Speaker 1>but that track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is in fact what the promise that </v>

2905
02:39:40.271 --> 02:39:42.550
<v Speaker 1>they hold for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're teachers.</v>

2906
02:39:42.551 --> 02:39:46.660
<v Speaker 1>They're teaching learning tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can teach us to be</v>

2907
02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:49.150
<v Speaker 3>the human beings</v>

2908
02:39:49.380 --> 02:39:52.200
<v Speaker 1>that we would like to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2909
02:39:52.380 --> 02:39:53.100
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2910
02:39:53.290 --> 02:39:54.930
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2911
02:39:54.960 --> 02:39:59.960
<v Speaker 1>that's the alternative to this hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological future,</v>

2912
02:40:00.630 --> 02:40:02.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2913
02:40:02.580 --> 02:40:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2914
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not against technology,</v>

2915
02:40:05.881 --> 02:40:07.710
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to,</v>

2916
02:40:09.010 --> 02:40:10.270
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to.</v>

2917
02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:16.430
<v Speaker 1>We have bring wisdom to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to make a situation where,</v>

2918
02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:19.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not controlling us.</v>

2919
02:40:19.711 --> 02:40:24.390
<v Speaker 1>We are controlling it and we're thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly about we have,</v>

2920
02:40:24.450 --> 02:40:29.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this enormous panoply of technologies </v>

2921
02:40:29.450 --> 02:40:32.341
<v Speaker 1>that can do so many things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to think about how do we deploy </v>

2922
02:40:32.341 --> 02:40:35.881
<v Speaker 1>those in such a way to maximize human </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential or you know,</v>

2923
02:40:36.511 --> 02:40:39.150
<v Speaker 1>our humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's really,</v>

2924
02:40:39.151 --> 02:40:42.060
<v Speaker 1>I think what the promise that </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics hold out.</v>

2925
02:40:43.230 --> 02:40:44.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2926
02:40:44.340 --> 02:40:46.800
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're hoping to create the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2927
02:40:46.801 --> 02:40:49.040
<v Speaker 1>as a colonel and we're not the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>

2928
02:40:49.050 --> 02:40:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Obviously a lot of people have this idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's happening,</v>

2929
02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:57.620
<v Speaker 1>but that's the idea is to create a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people couldn't learn this and you</v>

2930
02:41:00.101 --> 02:41:01.390
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2931
02:41:02.970 --> 02:41:05.250
<v Speaker 3>that's my hope for the future of </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity.</v>

2932
02:41:05.820 --> 02:41:10.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's great hope for the future that </v>

2933
02:41:10.820 --> 02:41:10.820
<v Speaker 3>people that are alive today and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the most important.</v>

2934
02:41:10.820 --> 02:41:15.800
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we do know it's here and I think </v>

2935
02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:18.921
<v Speaker 3>that's a great hope for what's here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if we don't do it pretty soon there </v>

2936
02:41:18.921 --> 02:41:20.670
<v Speaker 3>won't be anybody alive to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2937
02:41:20.671 --> 02:41:22.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the problem.</v>

2938
02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:25.680
<v Speaker 3>So the best way to end this I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

2939
02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So great.</v>
