127
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.580

128
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

129
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't,</v>

130
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

131
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 2>as much as he likes him,</v>

132
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 2>he's there to do the job</v>

133
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.210
<v Speaker 4>was a glove,</v>

136
00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:13.190
<v Speaker 4>It didn't have the closeness that we did to him cause he came,</v>

139
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.770
<v Speaker 4>So he didn't have quite the closest.</v>

140
00:03:21.771 --> 00:03:23.900
<v Speaker 4>He really liked him.</v>

141

151
00:03:37.911 --> 00:03:39.890
<v Speaker 4>but they just don't carry themselves.</v>

152
00:03:39.891 --> 00:03:40.724
<v Speaker 4>Most of them,</v>

153
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.690
<v Speaker 4>like martial artists,</v>

154
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.050
<v Speaker 4>they carry themselves like more like thugs or just,</v>

155
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.140
<v Speaker 4>they don't have the same comradery.</v>

156
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.333
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

157
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.540
<v Speaker 4>I have a picture of us,</v>

158
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.741
<v Speaker 4>Siler,</v>

159
00:03:51.741 --> 00:03:52.580
<v Speaker 4>of his fight in,</v>

160
00:03:52.581 --> 00:03:53.414
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

161
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.291
<v Speaker 4>in Kentucky.</v>

162
00:03:54.291 --> 00:03:54.710
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know,</v>

163
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.880
<v Speaker 4>I forgot the guy's name.</v>

164
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.590
<v Speaker 4>Really tough strong wrestler.</v>

165
00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.970
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

166
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.410
<v Speaker 4>he lost a close decision.</v>

167
00:04:00.411 --> 00:04:01.340
<v Speaker 4>It was his last fight.</v>

168
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.203
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

169
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.490
<v Speaker 4>but they were actually the day before the fight at the Wayne.</v>

170
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:08.563
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

171
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.231
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

172
00:04:09.231 --> 00:04:11.810
<v Speaker 4>they were hanging out playing video games together,</v>

173
00:04:11.811 --> 00:04:13.190
<v Speaker 4>like huddle together.</v>

174
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.481

175
00:04:14.481 --> 00:04:16.310

176
00:04:16.311 --> 00:04:16.911

188
00:04:23.781 --> 00:04:24.620
<v Speaker 4>We got to finish this game.</v>

189
00:04:24.621 --> 00:04:27.500
<v Speaker 4>And they hung out for like two hours at the way in.</v>

190
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.940
<v Speaker 4>And then the day of the fight,</v>

00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:32.570
<v Speaker 4>they were like hanging out in the dressing room and then they went out and put</v>

192
00:04:32.571 --> 00:04:33.620
<v Speaker 4>on a brutal,</v>

193
00:04:33.621 --> 00:04:33.831
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

194
00:04:33.831 --> 00:04:35.090
<v Speaker 4>it was a very brutal fight.</v>

195
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.030
<v Speaker 4>It was a good fight and it was a brutal,</v>

196
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.350
<v Speaker 4>they didn't hold back anything.</v>

197
00:04:39.351 --> 00:04:40.310
<v Speaker 4>They definitely fought.</v>

198
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.431
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

199
00:04:40.431 --> 00:04:41.480
<v Speaker 4>It was Dennis Bermudez,</v>

200
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.770
<v Speaker 4>who's a great guy as well.</v>

201
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

202
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

203
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.660
<v Speaker 4>and I mean,</v>

204
00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:45.770
<v Speaker 4>and that's the comradery.</v>

205
00:04:45.771 --> 00:04:48.260
<v Speaker 4>You don't see that in boxing and MMA.</v>

206
00:04:48.261 --> 00:04:49.640
<v Speaker 4>You see it more than you don't?</v>

207
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.350
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about bitcoin?</v>

208
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.720
<v Speaker 4>What</v>

209
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 2>do you think about crypto currencies?</v>

210
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about emerging?</v>

211
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.871
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

212
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of people,</v>

213
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

214
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 2>that are libertarian or some people that believe in hard money.</v>

215
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:02.580
<v Speaker 2>There are people that believe in gold that,</v>

216
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:03.414
<v Speaker 2>that are in bitcoin.</v>

217
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

218
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.690
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

219
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

220
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people who,</v>

221
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

222
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.750
<v Speaker 2>bought bitcoin a few years ago and you know,</v>

223
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I didn't buy it and sure.</v>

224
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:11.921
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

225
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had bought them because I would be selling them now.</v>

226
00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:14.651
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

227
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:15.580
<v Speaker 2>I would have already sold them,</v>

228
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.630
<v Speaker 2>so I dumped it already.</v>

229
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

230
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

231
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.851
<v Speaker 2>Because I think it's,</v>

232
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:19.690
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a bubble.</v>

233
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:20.201
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

234
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I think that between the here with Vegas casinos to casinos just start accepting</v>

235
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 2>bitcoins.</v>

236
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

237
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:26.884
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

238
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 2>I think merchants starting to accept bitcoins are actually going to be negative</v>

239
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 2>for Bitcoin's not positive.</v>

240
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

241
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.701
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

242
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:34.250
<v Speaker 2>here's why.</v>

243
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

244
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.350
<v Speaker 2>when bitcoins went up from Penny's a coin to $1,000,</v>

245
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.860
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

246
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.710
<v Speaker 2>Do you know you,</v>

247
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.420
<v Speaker 2>you really couldn't do much with them except whoredom so close before you go</v>

248
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.820
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

249
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.653
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

250
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.731
<v Speaker 2>sorry to interrupt you,</v>

251
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:47.920
<v Speaker 2>but explain to me what is it actually worth?</v>

252
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 2>What is a bitcoin is worth whatever somebody will give you for it.</v>

253
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean it has no actual value because you can't do anything with it.</v>

254
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

255
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 2>All you can do is give it to somebody else.</v>

256
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.190
<v Speaker 2>So is it in ones,</v>

257
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.470
<v Speaker 2>it means it in one bitcoin to bitcoins.</v>

258
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 2>Is the volume.</v>

259
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:01.431
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>

260
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

261
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 2>they usually sell them in one bitcoin,</v>

262
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 2>but you can pay,</v>

263
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 2>you can break a bitcoin up into like a hundred thousand peaks of it.</v>

264
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 2>Give me how much is a pizza?</v>

265
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.300
<v Speaker 2>How many bitcoins is a pizza?</v>

266
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

267
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.770
<v Speaker 2>a fraction because right now and in fire,</v>

270
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:18.800
<v Speaker 2>So how many pizzas you can get?</v>

271
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 2>A pizza is like $9 50 cents and you get laid a hundred pizza.</v>

272
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:22.890
<v Speaker 2>They don't have any other thing other than a bitcoin.</v>

273
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

274
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 2>It's just a bitcoin.</v>

<v Speaker 2>fractional coins.</v>

281
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to buy a whole coin.</v>

282
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

283
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 2>but they need to figure it out.</v>

284
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 2>You have to have like Nicole quarter.</v>

285
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.841
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 2>A coin is sent a coin.</v>

292
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.510

<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

298
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 2>you can spend it as long as somebody is willing to take it.</v>

299
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

300
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.070
<v Speaker 2>But there's no end user.</v>

301
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:55.461
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

302
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:56.390
<v Speaker 2>it's not a commodity.</v>

303
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 2>The same with our currency.</v>

304
00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Currently our currency is crap.</v>

305
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:00.331
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

306
00:07:00.331 --> 00:07:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

307
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.670
<v Speaker 2>you know why bitcoin is crap in our currency is the difference between the crap,</v>

308
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 2>the government issues and bitcoins is the crap the government issues for now as</v>

309
00:07:08.751 --> 00:07:09.584
<v Speaker 2>legal tender.</v>

310
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:10.071
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

311
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:10.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

312
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 2>people will accept it.</v>

313
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:12.410
<v Speaker 2>I can pay my taxes in it.</v>

314
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:12.591
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

315
00:07:12.591 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 2>I have a use for it.</v>

316
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.851
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

317
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:14.830
<v Speaker 2>But it's the government's.</v>

318
00:07:14.831 --> 00:07:18.240
<v Speaker 2>It's saying it's legal tender isn't the government enforcing being someone who's</v>

319
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.430
<v Speaker 2>so antigovernment as you,</v>

320
00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:20.930
<v Speaker 2>I would assume that that's why own gold,</v>

321
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.260
<v Speaker 2>but you would enjoy something like bitcoin coming along,</v>

322
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 2>but it has no real value.</v>

323
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:26.690
<v Speaker 2>I recognize that it could collapse.</v>

324
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:26.931
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

325
00:07:26.931 --> 00:07:28.670
<v Speaker 2>there's no a value.</v>

326
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:29.421
<v Speaker 2>Isn't there a value?</v>

327
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:31.430
<v Speaker 2>Just like we do tomorrow?</v>

328
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Everybody can agree there's no value.</v>

329
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.083
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

330
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 2>gold was valuable long before it became money.</v>

331
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin had no value until it became money,</v>

332
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it can withstand the test of time.</v>

333
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.160
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
