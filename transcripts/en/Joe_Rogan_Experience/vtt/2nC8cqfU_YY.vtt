<v Speaker 1>documented your entire standup comedy career.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I did sets.</v>

36
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:13.040

74
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably have a heart attack.</v>

75
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.571
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably be like,</v>

76
00:01:57.571 --> 00:01:58.111
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

77

<v Speaker 1>Kill Kill.</v>

111
00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:51.491
<v Speaker 1>Tony is a podcast that Tony Hinchcliffe started with Brian and you guys figured</v>

112
00:02:52.511 --> 00:02:57.511
<v Speaker 1>out a really delicious plan and it's have comics go up for a minute.</v>

113
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.833
<v Speaker 1>Just a minute.</v>

00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:03.131
<v Speaker 1>that was really funny.</v>

117
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Like that bullets and bricks guy.</v>

118
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:05.490
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

119
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

120
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>fucking good shit dude.</v>

121
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.490
<v Speaker 1>You could really be a calm,</v>

122
00:03:08.491 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I click you're a comic work at this and you can be a comic.</v>

123
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.681
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>

124
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>like some people like,</v>

125
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.791
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

126
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.540
<v Speaker 1>what was this craziness that I just saw her?</v>

127
00:03:14.541 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

128
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 1>And you get a chance to see like the professional comics fuck with these people</v>

129
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

130
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>get excited about seeing someone who's funny.</v>

131
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.730
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you hang out in the back of the original room a lot where you know,</v>

133
00:03:25.731 --> 00:03:28.490
<v Speaker 4>normal standup comedy takes place or any comedy club,</v>

134
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.780
<v Speaker 4>you'll always see a bunch of comedians in the back either standing around or</v>

135
00:03:32.781 --> 00:03:35.390
<v Speaker 4>sitting down and they're always whispering something in each other's ears.</v>

136
00:03:35.391 --> 00:03:38.210
<v Speaker 4>And that I always thought found that that to be some of the most interesting</v>

137
00:03:38.211 --> 00:03:39.080
<v Speaker 4>stuff is getting,</v>

138
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

139
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.521
<v Speaker 4>more pros,</v>

140
00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:43.640
<v Speaker 4>comedian perspective on what's happening in front of them.</v>

141
00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:44.540
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes they're like,</v>

142
00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:45.950
<v Speaker 4>this person's going to be a star.</v>

143
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.150
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes it's like,</v>

144
00:03:47.151 --> 00:03:47.720
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

145
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.990
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe this guy didn't iron his shirt before coming out.</v>

146
00:03:50.991 --> 00:03:55.430
<v Speaker 4>And that wide range of conversation that happens between experience comedians</v>

147
00:03:55.431 --> 00:03:58.760
<v Speaker 4>watching newer comedy is always entertaining.</v>

148
00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.540
<v Speaker 4>And I figured,</v>

149
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 4>how do we turn that into a spontaneous podcast that is refillable so people sign</v>

150
00:04:05.601 --> 00:04:07.910
<v Speaker 4>up and there's a big bucket and people get a new minute.</v>

151
00:04:07.911 --> 00:04:10.610
<v Speaker 4>Some people travel from around.</v>

152
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.360
<v Speaker 4>We've had,</v>

153
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.940
<v Speaker 4>we just had somebody on the traveled from Scotland to do kill Tony for his first</v>

154
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>time on stage and so fuck you all right,</v>

155
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 4>Australia every week it's somebody new.</v>

156
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 4>So people like literally rather than doing a bigger set somewhere else,</v>

157
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 4>they'll purposefully start on kill Tony because they listened to that show and</v>

158
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 4>that's what made them realize or gave them the inspiration that they'd like to</v>

159
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 4>at least try to do this thing that they've always inside one or to do.</v>

160
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.891
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

161
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 4>It's really fun getting to give people that opportunity and have them be excited</v>

162
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 4>about it and inspired.</v>

163
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.870
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

164
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.100
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to do too.</v>

165
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I did it with dom Irrera and we had the fucking best time.</v>

166
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.780
<v Speaker 1>It was so much fun.</v>

167
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.180
<v Speaker 1>And I think that one of the things that I've been thinking about lately,</v>

168
00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:54.680
<v Speaker 1>like because I did my special and I threw out all my material and I'm starting</v>

169
00:04:54.681 --> 00:04:55.610
<v Speaker 1>off with all new material,</v>

170
00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:57.950
<v Speaker 1>I have to write a lot and I'm just like in this like frantic,</v>

171
00:04:57.951 --> 00:04:58.880
<v Speaker 1>frenzied mode.</v>

172
00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.691
<v Speaker 1>One of the things,</v>

173
00:04:59.691 --> 00:05:00.590
<v Speaker 1>it's really good,</v>

174
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.210
<v Speaker 1>it's like watching other people sort of like try to piece it together and then</v>

175
00:05:05.211 --> 00:05:07.670
<v Speaker 1>talking about like what was wrong with that?</v>

176
00:05:07.671 --> 00:05:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't that like,</v>

177
00:05:08.811 --> 00:05:09.770
<v Speaker 1>what's an in,</v>

178
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.490
<v Speaker 1>in doing that you kind of do some stuff that you ordinarily probably don't do</v>

179
00:05:13.491 --> 00:05:14.720
<v Speaker 1>much with your stand up.</v>

180
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.621
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of comics,</v>

181
00:05:15.621 --> 00:05:16.670
<v Speaker 1>they record their sets,</v>

182
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.380
<v Speaker 1>very few listen to those sets,</v>

183
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

184
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Most guys just record them and then just go fuck that and just,</v>

185
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.770
<v Speaker 1>and just keep going for whatever reason.</v>

186
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.320
<v Speaker 1>But when you're forced to analyze your stuff,</v>

187
00:05:27.321 --> 00:05:28.101
<v Speaker 1>like I did a,</v>

188
00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:28.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Ari has that podcast,</v>

190
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.381
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

191
00:05:30.381 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>the skeptic tank and every now and then he'll do an episode with a comic and</v>

192
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll play a CD and you have to go over the CD.</v>

193
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.200
<v Speaker 1>And I went over the CD and as I was going over and I was like thinking about all</v>

194
00:05:39.201 --> 00:05:39.621
<v Speaker 1>kinds of things.</v>

195
00:05:39.621 --> 00:05:40.371
<v Speaker 1>It was an old CD.</v>

196
00:05:40.371 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't listened to it and like six years and as I was listened to us,</v>

197
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.230
<v Speaker 1>like there's like a lot of shit in here.</v>

198
00:05:45.231 --> 00:05:46.700
<v Speaker 1>I would do different or nice.</v>

199
00:05:46.701 --> 00:05:47.870
<v Speaker 1>See how I did that then,</v>

200
00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:48.171
<v Speaker 1>oh Ooh,</v>

201
00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I used to do that better.</v>

202
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I had this bit,</v>

203
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:52.850
<v Speaker 1>and you start thinking like you can actually listen.</v>

205
00:05:52.851 --> 00:05:54.320
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to yourself from six years ago,</v>

206
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.970
<v Speaker 1>you could actually listen to yourself.</v>

207
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Like as an outsider,</v>

208
00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.270
<v Speaker 1>like I know that it's me,</v>

209
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 1>I recognize the voice,</v>

210
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 1>but I barely remember the material cause it's so long ago.</v>

211
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

212
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

213
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.121
<v Speaker 4>About a month ago,</v>

214
00:06:04.121 --> 00:06:06.130
<v Speaker 4>buddy came up to me or not even a buddy,</v>

215
00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:07.630
<v Speaker 4>it was just a random guy and he goes,</v>

216
00:06:07.631 --> 00:06:07.961
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

217
00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:10.060
<v Speaker 4>I saw you like five or six years ago.</v>

218
00:06:10.061 --> 00:06:14.680
<v Speaker 4>You did that one joke about this thing and I totally forgot that I did it.</v>

219
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.180
<v Speaker 4>Come to completely.</v>

220
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.480
<v Speaker 4>And I got so excited because I hadn't heard that had anybody on kill Tony or</v>

221
00:06:21.611 --> 00:06:23.500
<v Speaker 4>another comedian came up with this premise,</v>

222
00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:24.334
<v Speaker 4>I would have gone,</v>

223
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.050
<v Speaker 4>that's a great premise by the way,</v>

224
00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:27.190
<v Speaker 4>just want to let you know,</v>

225
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.230
<v Speaker 4>I love what you're doing with the blank and blank thing.</v>

226
00:06:29.231 --> 00:06:30.064
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

227
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.240
<v Speaker 4>And I was so excited because it was like he gave me this gift that was just</v>

228
00:06:34.241 --> 00:06:37.210
<v Speaker 4>something that I did anyway that I didn't remember that I did from five or six</v>

229
00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:37.541
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

230
00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:41.230
<v Speaker 4>But that crazy enough is the joke that he remembered me from this open mic from.</v>

231
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.270
<v Speaker 4>So it was amazing because yeah,</v>

232
00:06:43.271 --> 00:06:44.350
<v Speaker 4>the perspective is different.</v>

233
00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:48.820
<v Speaker 4>The joke that I do now off that thing is totally different because I came with</v>

234
00:06:48.821 --> 00:06:49.300
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

235
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.901
<v Speaker 4>a fresher,</v>

236
00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:51.430
<v Speaker 4>more educated.</v>

237
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm more knowledgeable of who I am,</v>

238
00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:55.990
<v Speaker 4>so I know how I really want to do that joke that the fresh me,</v>

239
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.550
<v Speaker 4>Kate wrote the premise for it.</v>

240
00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.291
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

241
00:06:58.291 --> 00:06:58.591
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

242
00:06:58.591 --> 00:06:58.801
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

243
00:06:58.801 --> 00:06:59.820
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting though.</v>

244
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

245
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.060
<v Speaker 1>that's really cool.</v>

246
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.400
<v Speaker 1>In their house.</v>

247
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.610
<v Speaker 1>I've had that happen a couple of times.</v>

248
00:07:02.611 --> 00:07:05.220
<v Speaker 1>When people come to you and they remind you of a bit and then you're like,</v>

249
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.030
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

250
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:06.863
<v Speaker 1>Or sometimes,</v>

251
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

252
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.611
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

253
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I listened to probably half of my recordings,</v>

254
00:07:11.251 --> 00:07:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't listen to all of them,</v>

255
00:07:12.091 --> 00:07:13.020
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty diligent.</v>

256
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.630
<v Speaker 1>If I know that I got a bunch of new stuff out,</v>

257
00:07:15.631 --> 00:07:16.464
<v Speaker 1>I'll listen to it.</v>

258
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.450
<v Speaker 1>But every now and then I'll listen to one and I'll go,</v>

259
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.930
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

260
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:19.763
<v Speaker 1>I forgot.</v>

261
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness,</v>

262
00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:22.080
<v Speaker 1>I forgot that part.</v>

263
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.210
<v Speaker 1>And that part like makes everything way better.</v>

264
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.721
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

265
00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Where that part takes it in another direction.</v>

266
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

267
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.120
<v Speaker 4>Every little,</v>

268
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.600
<v Speaker 4>every little thing that you can add on when once you're already in a topic,</v>

269
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.220
<v Speaker 4>it's a huge gift because it,</v>

270
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.520
<v Speaker 4>not only is it just one show,</v>

271
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.713
<v Speaker 4>but once it,</v>

272
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.690
<v Speaker 4>once it's ingrained in the actual thing,</v>

273
00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:45.691
<v Speaker 4>that means thousands and thousands of people are all going to have that laugh.</v>

274
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:46.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

275
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean every show,</v>

276
00:07:47.261 --> 00:07:50.170
<v Speaker 4>once it's part of the thing and especially it only gets better.</v>

277
00:07:50.171 --> 00:07:51.760
<v Speaker 4>So once it's a really working,</v>

278
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:52.621
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

279
00:07:52.621 --> 00:07:55.710
<v Speaker 1>they become like little living organisms and the more you feed them and more</v>

280
00:07:55.711 --> 00:07:56.640
<v Speaker 1>attention to give them,</v>

281
00:07:56.641 --> 00:07:57.600
<v Speaker 1>the bigger they grow.</v>

282
00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.490
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you have to abandon them.</v>

283
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes like,</v>

284
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:00.451
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

285
00:08:00.451 --> 00:08:01.560
<v Speaker 1>this one's just bad.</v>

286
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.300
<v Speaker 1>It's just that it's down a bad road.</v>

287
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.291
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to do this.</v>

288
00:08:04.291 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

289
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Like I have bits that never made it to cds,</v>

290
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.580
<v Speaker 1>never made specials and nick,</v>

291
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.590
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they killed and sometimes they didn't.</v>

292
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it just doesn't know what the fuck I was doing with them.</v>

293
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

294
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.340
<v Speaker 1>You know when you let go,</v>

295
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this anymore.</v>

296
00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:17.760
<v Speaker 1>So just like I'm not married to this just because I've been doing it.</v>

297
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Like you just got to abandon them.</v>

298
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes it so crazy what you girls are doing it.</v>

299
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

300
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.000
<v Speaker 1>because you guys are going up and you're doing a fresh minute every week because</v>

301
00:08:27.001 --> 00:08:27.360
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

302
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.960
<v Speaker 1>you don't get like a developmental cycle when you're putting together a freshman</v>

303
00:08:30.961 --> 00:08:31.650
<v Speaker 1>at every week.</v>

304
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.980
<v Speaker 1>You're just hoping that your ideas are good when you get up there.</v>

305
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:39.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean you doing your sets like a couple of days before you do kill Tony or like</v>

306
00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:40.410
<v Speaker 1>how many,</v>

307
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:41.790
<v Speaker 1>when do you write your stuff out?</v>

308
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh go ahead.</v>

309
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.240
<v Speaker 1>I write mine all week.</v>

310
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Like I just write down jokes as much as I can all week and then I try to work</v>

311
00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:50.310
<v Speaker 1>them out before,</v>

312
00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.430
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes I just pick one and then I just build on it.</v>

313
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 1>When on when you go that podcast and you know that it's live and it's on the</v>

314
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Internet and then you're just going up with this shit that you hope might work,</v>

315
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 1>like what is that feeling like?</v>

316
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.860
<v Speaker 3>It's so scary.</v>

317
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:07.191
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

318
00:09:07.191 --> 00:09:07.551
<v Speaker 3>Sarah,</v>

319
00:09:07.551 --> 00:09:07.641
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

320
00:09:07.641 --> 00:09:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Sarah does her as a week before and a lot of the times I write mine,</v>

321
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.680
<v Speaker 3>like the day I'm going in,</v>

322
00:09:12.681 --> 00:09:14.240
<v Speaker 3>I write it and you know what most,</v>

323
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.090
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the times when I write mine the day of are the ones that do really,</v>

324
00:09:17.091 --> 00:09:21.380
<v Speaker 3>really well because then I'm not as nervous and it comes out more natural and</v>

325
00:09:21.381 --> 00:09:22.910
<v Speaker 3>that's another thing I've learned on killed Tony.</v>

326
00:09:22.911 --> 00:09:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Just mostly like stage presence is a huge thing because you have the live</v>

327
00:09:26.661 --> 00:09:27.530
<v Speaker 3>audience too,</v>

328
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:28.101
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

329
00:09:28.101 --> 00:09:28.431
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

330
00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:31.430
<v Speaker 3>so it's not like you're just doing a minute on just a podcast.</v>

331
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.380
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that means?</v>

332
00:09:32.381 --> 00:09:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Like what does stage presence mean?</v>

333
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Oof.</v>

334
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.500
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting one in the,</v>

335
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.290
<v Speaker 1>because it means different things to different people.</v>

336
00:09:38.291 --> 00:09:38.561
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

337
00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

338
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.150
<v Speaker 1>what exactly does that mean</v>

339
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:40.800
<v Speaker 3>for me?</v>

340
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.750
<v Speaker 3>Just means like looking confident and calm,</v>

341
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.120
<v Speaker 3>where I don't,</v>

342
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.570
<v Speaker 3>not having the audience being uncomfortable watching you,</v>

343
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

344
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

345
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:48.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

346
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:49.734
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>

347
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a bit longer than you watch someone,</v>

348
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:51.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

349
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:52.261
<v Speaker 1>they're nervous up there.</v>

350
00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:52.561
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

351
00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:53.100
<v Speaker 1>yikes.</v>

352
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Calm down dude.</v>

353
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.570
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

354
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

355
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.110
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's really cool is,</v>

356
00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:57.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

357
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:58.130
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

358
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.030
<v Speaker 4>the live audience watches the show and they see names being randomly pulled out</v>

359
00:10:02.031 --> 00:10:06.680
<v Speaker 4>of a bucket with 20 or 30 comedians waiting to run from the top and come down</v>

360
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.450
<v Speaker 4>the stairs and be on the show.</v>

361
00:10:08.451 --> 00:10:08.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

362
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.530
<v Speaker 4>they're going from a viewer to an audience.</v>

363
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.940
<v Speaker 4>They're going from an audience member to a comedian,</v>

364
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.710
<v Speaker 4>to a podcast guest,</v>

365
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.410
<v Speaker 4>and then thrown back out in the belly room again.</v>

366
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.760
<v Speaker 4>So they're uh,</v>

367
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:20.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

368
00:10:20.121 --> 00:10:21.800
<v Speaker 4>it's also so cool because they,</v>

369
00:10:21.801 --> 00:10:26.801
<v Speaker 4>these two always go on at the end of each show and every time,</v>

370
00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:28.550
<v Speaker 4>especially even this last episode,</v>

371
00:10:28.551 --> 00:10:32.210
<v Speaker 4>we just had the last comedian that I pulled out of the bucket before I knew I</v>

372
00:10:32.211 --> 00:10:33.050
<v Speaker 4>was going to that part.</v>

373
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.510
<v Speaker 4>It was an unbelievable interview.</v>

374
00:10:35.511 --> 00:10:36.530
<v Speaker 4>Probably one of the biggest,</v>

375
00:10:36.531 --> 00:10:37.700
<v Speaker 4>longest interviews we ever had.</v>

376
00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:42.230
<v Speaker 4>We found out that this kid is living in some big producers house by being half</v>

377
00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:43.640
<v Speaker 4>gay and like half,</v>

378
00:10:43.641 --> 00:10:46.760
<v Speaker 4>like teasing him with things and being cute around the house.</v>

379
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.880
<v Speaker 4>But I'm producing sledding and live in this around the house.</v>

380
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:50.631
<v Speaker 4>It's unbelievable.</v>

381
00:10:50.631 --> 00:10:52.580
<v Speaker 4>This big producers letting them live in this mansion.</v>

382
00:10:52.581 --> 00:10:57.410
<v Speaker 4>We found out all this stuff and think that nothing can follow that,</v>

383
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.240
<v Speaker 4>but what really does follow it?</v>

384
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.550
<v Speaker 4>And it even surprised me cause I'm like,</v>

385
00:11:01.551 --> 00:11:01.851
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

386
00:11:01.851 --> 00:11:03.140
<v Speaker 4>I hope that that,</v>

387
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.750
<v Speaker 4>that it goes how it normally goes is they come in,</v>

388
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.120
<v Speaker 4>even though that was crushing,</v>

389
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.890
<v Speaker 4>I had to send them off and go,</v>

390
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:10.281
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

391
00:11:10.281 --> 00:11:13.460
<v Speaker 4>well this is the part of the show where our two regulars go up and sure enough,</v>

392
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.800
<v Speaker 4>right when you thought it couldn't get any better,</v>

393
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:18.470
<v Speaker 4>they just own it with exactly that thing,</v>

394
00:11:18.471 --> 00:11:19.670
<v Speaker 4>which is that comfortable.</v>

395
00:11:19.671 --> 00:11:24.671
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden the audience is seeing these two assassins who do this every</v>

396
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.700
<v Speaker 4>week and they can feel it.</v>

397
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.400
<v Speaker 4>Not only did they hear me say it before when I bring them up,</v>

398
00:11:28.401 --> 00:11:28.820
<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>

399
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.220
<v Speaker 4>you can really feel it because if they couldn't feel it,</v>

400
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.110
<v Speaker 4>then they would just go,</v>

401
00:11:33.111 --> 00:11:33.381
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

402
00:11:33.381 --> 00:11:33.980
<v Speaker 4>these two,</v>

403
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.221
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

404
00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:34.881
<v Speaker 4>I mean the GS,</v>

405
00:11:34.881 --> 00:11:35.780
<v Speaker 4>they do this every week,</v>

406
00:11:35.781 --> 00:11:36.770
<v Speaker 4>but instead it makes,</v>

407
00:11:36.771 --> 00:11:38.690
<v Speaker 4>it's always the best way to close the show.</v>

408
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.190
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't always that way,</v>

409
00:11:40.191 --> 00:11:41.024
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>

410
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:45.110
<v Speaker 4>And that's what really the coolest part is about this whole documentary thing in</v>

411
00:11:45.111 --> 00:11:47.570
<v Speaker 4>my opinion is that yeah,</v>

412
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.840
<v Speaker 4>maybe some of the sets weren't the best of this or that,</v>

413
00:11:50.841 --> 00:11:52.040
<v Speaker 4>but they're,</v>

414
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:52.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

415
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 4>not only does the audience get to watch the overall growth for the ones which is</v>

416
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:57.220
<v Speaker 4>the many,</v>

417
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.990
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the diehard fans,</v>

418
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.160
<v Speaker 4>so many of them,</v>

419
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:00.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

420
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:01.631
<v Speaker 4>talk about that.</v>

421
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:02.321
<v Speaker 4>When they see me,</v>

422
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:07.300
<v Speaker 4>like in Toronto when we just did a theater a few weeks ago with this show and so</v>

423
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:08.170
<v Speaker 4>many people were like,</v>

424
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:08.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

425
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.560
<v Speaker 4>getting to watch Kim and Sarah go from how they were to these monsters that you</v>

426
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:15.010
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

427
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:20.010
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty much a guarantee that you're going to hear a brand new set of jokes</v>

428
00:12:20.921 --> 00:12:25.420
<v Speaker 4>that is pretty good and it's going to be a part of something bigger eventually.</v>

429
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.920
<v Speaker 4>So they get the first look at it,</v>

430
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.263
<v Speaker 4>which is cool.</v>

431
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:28.501
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

433
00:12:29.821 --> 00:12:30.990
<v Speaker 5>you're coming up with new shit.</v>

434
00:12:30.991 --> 00:12:32.460
<v Speaker 5>Like that's like the hardest part of common.</v>

435
00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:34.710
<v Speaker 5>He's coming up with new shit and you're coming up with new shit.</v>

436
00:12:34.711 --> 00:12:37.050
<v Speaker 5>Like as fast as anybody is like a minute a week.</v>

437
00:12:37.051 --> 00:12:38.820
<v Speaker 5>It's about as fast as anybody can do it.</v>

438
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:39.721
<v Speaker 5>I give you,</v>

439
00:12:39.721 --> 00:12:40.860
<v Speaker 5>if you get lucky,</v>

440
00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:43.110
<v Speaker 5>like every now and then you'll hit like a five minute streak.</v>

441
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.590
<v Speaker 5>Like you got a new chunk and it's five minutes long ago.</v>

442
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.111
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

443
00:12:46.111 --> 00:12:47.310
<v Speaker 5>I hit a gold mine.</v>

444
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:51.180
<v Speaker 5>You know when you start pulling bits out of it or pulling taglines and and</v>

445
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.590
<v Speaker 5>premises and sidelines on,</v>

446
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:56.370
<v Speaker 5>and then you'll have one that's like fucking 15 seconds or one that's 20 seconds</v>

447
00:12:56.371 --> 00:12:57.204
<v Speaker 5>here like this.</v>

448
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:58.410
<v Speaker 5>You can't get a minute.</v>

449
00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:58.890
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

450
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.970
<v Speaker 5>If you have to get a minute every week and a minute that you're going to stand</v>

451
00:13:01.971 --> 00:13:03.210
<v Speaker 5>by and that's going to be on the Internet.</v>

452
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:03.601
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

453
00:13:03.601 --> 00:13:04.300
<v Speaker 3>good luck.</v>

454
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:04.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

455
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.920
<v Speaker 3>I think me and Sarah Gotten pretty solid at knowing exactly what a minute is</v>

456
00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:08.400
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

457
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.900
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we end on with 58</v>

458
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.621
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy too.</v>

459
00:13:11.621 --> 00:13:12.790
<v Speaker 4>Now they're the only two.</v>

460
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:13.750
<v Speaker 4>You know everybody else,</v>

461
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:17.470
<v Speaker 4>you'll hear the meow of a kitty at 60 seconds to let them know their time's up.</v>

462
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.450
<v Speaker 4>They'll just crushed,</v>

463
00:13:18.451 --> 00:13:18.691
<v Speaker 4>crushed,</v>

464
00:13:18.691 --> 00:13:18.971
<v Speaker 4>crushed,</v>

465
00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:19.201
<v Speaker 4>crushed,</v>

466
00:13:19.201 --> 00:13:19.451
<v Speaker 4>crushed,</v>

467
00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:19.960
<v Speaker 4>crushed,</v>

468
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.070
<v Speaker 4>crushed and say good night.</v>

469
00:13:21.071 --> 00:13:24.010
<v Speaker 4>And I looked down at the lower left where Brian is the clock and it always is</v>

470
00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:26.530
<v Speaker 4>(575) 085-0960</v>

471
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:27.883
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

472
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.370
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly what a minute is cause I take Lyft now and they're like you need</v>

473
00:13:31.371 --> 00:13:33.950
<v Speaker 3>one minute to get outside and they'll call me and I'm like,</v>

474
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.540
<v Speaker 3>oh I know I have 20 seconds left.</v>

475
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.620
<v Speaker 3>Like I know a minute.</v>

476
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.120
<v Speaker 5>Does that help at all in bed?</v>

477
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:40.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

478
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.010
<v Speaker 5>I know exactly.</v>

479
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.960
<v Speaker 5>The dude's like I gave you 30 minutes of fury,</v>

480
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.600
<v Speaker 5>you're like 33 so it was seven and a half.</v>

481
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:47.911
<v Speaker 5>You're like I know.</v>

482
00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:49.110
<v Speaker 5>Seven and a half minutes.</v>

483
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

484
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Well it's also crazy doing like a longer set afterward like cause I'm so used to</v>

485
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:55.713
<v Speaker 3>these minutes.</v>

486
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.670
<v Speaker 3>So like going back and like just everything was just tighter.</v>

487
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.181
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

488
00:14:00.181 --> 00:14:00.901
<v Speaker 5>I was going to ask that.</v>

489
00:14:00.901 --> 00:14:02.470
<v Speaker 5>Like what does it like doing like a dude?</v>

490
00:14:02.471 --> 00:14:03.720
<v Speaker 5>What's the longest you guys have done?</v>

491
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.150
<v Speaker 5>Like 25 Oh wow.</v>

492
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.230
<v Speaker 5>What about you?</v>

493
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.630
<v Speaker 5>20 and 2025 and both of you have been,</v>

494
00:14:09.631 --> 00:14:11.630
<v Speaker 5>you've been doing it a little over a year and you've been doing it.</v>

495
00:14:11.631 --> 00:14:12.900
<v Speaker 5>How long it close to three.</v>

496
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.913
<v Speaker 5>Close to three years.</v>

497
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.130
<v Speaker 5>So 2025 minutes that you would like you,</v>

498
00:14:17.131 --> 00:14:18.420
<v Speaker 5>would you put it on a comedy special?</v>

499
00:14:18.421 --> 00:14:20.130
<v Speaker 5>What'd you guys consider doing a comedy special?</v>

500
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.300
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't put 25 minutes on a car.</v>

501
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.060
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't put 20 minutes on a comedy special.</v>

502
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:24.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

503
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm comfortable with 15 minutes.</v>

504
00:14:26.411 --> 00:14:27.310
<v Speaker 3>I like really have a,</v>

505
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.060
<v Speaker 3>I think I have a good 15 that's Brian's idea actually to release 15 minutes</v>

506
00:14:31.061 --> 00:14:31.630
<v Speaker 3>specials.</v>

507
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

508
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:36.040
<v Speaker 3>Like every two months release a 15 minutes special and then like in like eight</v>

509
00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:37.720
<v Speaker 3>months you'll have a an hour special.</v>

510
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:38.230
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

511
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

512
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.060
<v Speaker 3>And then yeah.</v>

513
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.680
<v Speaker 3>Increments of comedy.</v>

514
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:42.573
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

515
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

516
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:43.941
<v Speaker 3>It's not about it.</v>

517
00:14:43.941 --> 00:14:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

518
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

519
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.770
<v Speaker 4>And the other cool thing with their thing is that they get to be in front of</v>

520
00:14:49.771 --> 00:14:50.970
<v Speaker 4>those comedians.</v>

521
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

522
00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

523
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.520
<v Speaker 1>we've met so many people.</v>

524
00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

525
00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.580
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool to get their perspectives to,</v>

526
00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

527
00:14:57.061 --> 00:14:57.960
<v Speaker 1>the comedy store,</v>

528
00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.290
<v Speaker 1>what since I've been gone has grown like a measurably,</v>

529
00:15:01.291 --> 00:15:02.124
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

530
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.750
<v Speaker 1>It's such a different environment there.</v>

531
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Like you guys had always said it was a different environment.</v>

532
00:15:05.521 --> 00:15:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Then I started doing sets there.</v>

533
00:15:06.691 --> 00:15:06.991
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

534
00:15:06.991 --> 00:15:07.291
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

535
00:15:07.291 --> 00:15:08.280
<v Speaker 1>this is so different.</v>

536
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Like the new management staff and the new regime running it there.</v>

537
00:15:12.061 --> 00:15:16.440
<v Speaker 1>So on the ball it's like someone figured out that there's this fucking gold mine</v>

538
00:15:16.441 --> 00:15:19.800
<v Speaker 1>on sunset and a professional management team started handling it.</v>

539
00:15:19.801 --> 00:15:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

540
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what it's like.</v>

541
00:15:21.001 --> 00:15:22.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like a real comedy club now except,</v>

542
00:15:22.811 --> 00:15:25.620
<v Speaker 1>but still like flooded with maniacs.</v>

543
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

544
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:26.801
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

545
00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:27.461
<v Speaker 4>When I got there,</v>

546
00:15:27.461 --> 00:15:31.060
<v Speaker 4>which was right after you weren't there just slip a couple months after.</v>

547
00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.140
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

548
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.600
<v Speaker 4>a lot of those rooms were dark sitting there dark,</v>

549
00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:35.650
<v Speaker 4>especially little take,</v>

550
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.450
<v Speaker 4>let's take it last night for example,</v>

551
00:15:37.451 --> 00:15:40.660
<v Speaker 4>where that main room is just packed to the gills and their show shows going on</v>

552
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.530
<v Speaker 4>though the belly room would set dark most nights in the main room,</v>

553
00:15:44.531 --> 00:15:49.150
<v Speaker 4>especially with sit completely dark if it's just this giant 400 and whatever</v>

554
00:15:49.151 --> 00:15:53.200
<v Speaker 4>seat room that you'd have to walk through to go get the ladder to put new names</v>

555
00:15:53.201 --> 00:15:54.290
<v Speaker 4>on the sign or whatever.</v>

556
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:54.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

557
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.140
<v Speaker 4>and that's what it was known as,</v>

558
00:15:56.141 --> 00:15:57.070
<v Speaker 4>like that's what was happening.</v>

559
00:15:57.071 --> 00:15:58.030
<v Speaker 4>But now every night,</v>

560
00:15:58.031 --> 00:15:58.630
<v Speaker 4>and there's those,</v>

561
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.640
<v Speaker 4>these cool shows that are coming out.</v>

562
00:16:00.641 --> 00:16:02.470
<v Speaker 4>Same thing with roast battle on Tuesdays.</v>

563
00:16:02.471 --> 00:16:05.170
<v Speaker 4>Like that shows insane Tuesday at midnight.</v>

564
00:16:05.171 --> 00:16:05.980
<v Speaker 4>That changed.</v>

565
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.350
<v Speaker 4>That changed like 70 people's sleep schedules.</v>

566
00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:08.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

567
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.330
<v Speaker 4>People wake up late on Wednesdays now because of it.</v>

568
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Joe Was the show that brought me back.</v>

569
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:14.430
<v Speaker 1>I did a,</v>

570
00:16:14.431 --> 00:16:16.730
<v Speaker 1>I went to see that the night before our,</v>

571
00:16:16.731 --> 00:16:20.850
<v Speaker 1>he taped a special there and the camaraderie and the fun in the air.</v>

572
00:16:20.851 --> 00:16:21.151
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

573
00:16:21.151 --> 00:16:21.721
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

574
00:16:21.721 --> 00:16:22.830
<v Speaker 1>this is like nothing else.</v>

575
00:16:22.831 --> 00:16:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

576
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.780
<v Speaker 1>This place is like nothing else on earth,</v>

577
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.310
<v Speaker 1>and I just decided like,</v>

578
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:26.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

579
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.870
<v Speaker 1>why am I not coming here anymore?</v>

580
00:16:27.871 --> 00:16:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a stupid,</v>

581
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:29.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

582
00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.750
<v Speaker 1>It just became ridiculous.</v>

583
00:16:30.751 --> 00:16:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really obvious.</v>

584
00:16:32.311 --> 00:16:33.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same place.</v>

585
00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.210
<v Speaker 1>It's just there's this weird vibe there,</v>

586
00:16:36.211 --> 00:16:37.044
<v Speaker 1>this chaos.</v>

587
00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:37.740
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

588
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.270
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a midnight show.</v>

589
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:39.751
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

590
00:16:39.751 --> 00:16:43.830
<v Speaker 1>And this place is packed with people and they're just dissing each other and</v>

591
00:16:43.831 --> 00:16:44.700
<v Speaker 1>when they're dissing each other,</v>

592
00:16:44.701 --> 00:16:48.810
<v Speaker 1>people are jumping on the stands and Jeremiah Watkins and all his buddies there,</v>

593
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.330
<v Speaker 1>they have all these different antics that they do in between.</v>

594
00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.130
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hilarious.</v>

595
00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.211
<v Speaker 1>And why I was there,</v>

596
00:16:54.211 --> 00:16:54.571
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

597
00:16:54.571 --> 00:16:54.931
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

598
00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I can't even believe this.</v>

599
00:16:56.161 --> 00:16:57.360
<v Speaker 1>This is really good.</v>

600
00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Like what an environment like it,</v>

601
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.290
<v Speaker 1>you could feel like the,</v>

602
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.140
<v Speaker 1>I want to say like the creativity,</v>

603
00:17:04.141 --> 00:17:04.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

604
00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.310
<v Speaker 1>the realness,</v>

605
00:17:05.311 --> 00:17:05.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

606
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:09.030
<v Speaker 1>you could feel the authenticity of the comics that were all hanging out.</v>

607
00:17:09.031 --> 00:17:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

608
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.020
<v Speaker 4>And it's all just for us.</v>

609
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.770
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

610
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:14.260
<v Speaker 4>It's not like anybody's getting paid for that or anything.</v>

611
00:17:14.261 --> 00:17:16.360
<v Speaker 4>Like we're all just trying to crack each other up.</v>

612
00:17:16.361 --> 00:17:17.530
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's playing their,</v>

613
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:18.700
<v Speaker 4>their role.</v>

614
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.630
<v Speaker 4>And like you said,</v>

615
00:17:19.631 --> 00:17:23.980
<v Speaker 4>when Jeremiah and Shamar neighbors like on separated,</v>

616
00:17:23.981 --> 00:17:25.330
<v Speaker 4>those two guys are monsters.</v>

617
00:17:25.331 --> 00:17:27.580
<v Speaker 4>But when Jeremiah and Joe Margaret near each other,</v>

618
00:17:27.581 --> 00:17:28.840
<v Speaker 4>they tried out do each other.</v>

619
00:17:28.841 --> 00:17:30.730
<v Speaker 4>We always talk about how they're a modern day,</v>

620
00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:31.320
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

621
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:31.840
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

622
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.130
<v Speaker 4>Pryor and gene wilder.</v>

623
00:17:33.131 --> 00:17:36.340
<v Speaker 4>Like there's something about when those two they have to out goofy each other.</v>

624
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.641
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

625
00:17:36.641 --> 00:17:36.941
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

626
00:17:36.941 --> 00:17:37.560
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

627
00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:37.910
<v Speaker 4>But when,</v>

628
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.390
<v Speaker 4>when they're together and they're in their clothes where they'd been doing</v>

629
00:17:40.391 --> 00:17:42.730
<v Speaker 4>comedy together for years being goofballs,</v>

630
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.730
<v Speaker 4>but now they finally have a field where they can showcase it.</v>

631
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:46.271
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

632
00:17:46.271 --> 00:17:49.090
<v Speaker 1>people forget about those prior gene wilder.</v>

633
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

634
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Those movers were God damn sensational at the time.</v>

635
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.880
<v Speaker 1>They were like the best like comedy team ever.</v>

636
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.610
<v Speaker 1>And for whatever reason it doesn't get discussed that much.</v>

637
00:17:59.611 --> 00:17:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

638
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed the shit out of those movies.</v>

639
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they hold up today.</v>

640
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen one recently?</v>

641
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:05.094
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

642
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.113
<v Speaker 1>it's been a long time.</v>

643
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

644
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.613
<v Speaker 1>I would wonder.</v>

645
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.960
<v Speaker 1>It's sucks when like stuff that you really liked.</v>

646
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Like I watched altered states.</v>

647
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:15.150
<v Speaker 1>You know that movie altered states about the guy who turns into a monkey in a</v>

648
00:18:15.151 --> 00:18:17.430
<v Speaker 1>sensory deprivation tank is William hurt.</v>

649
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.353
<v Speaker 1>Never saw that.</v>

650
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.460
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome in 1981 in 2014 you fucking just giggle through it.</v>

651
00:18:23.461 --> 00:18:23.731
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

652
00:18:23.731 --> 00:18:26.190
<v Speaker 1>what kind of a piece of shit and my washing,</v>

653
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.840
<v Speaker 1>this is so fucking stupid.</v>

654
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.340
<v Speaker 1>And like I have such great reverence for Richard Pryor and gene wilder.</v>

655
00:18:32.341 --> 00:18:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I would hate to watch something that they did and not enjoy it.</v>

656
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.750
<v Speaker 4>The new Beverly Cinema Theater right around the corner from where I live that</v>

657
00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:43.510
<v Speaker 4>Quentin Tarantino owns is actually playing a two Richard Pryor specials back to</v>

658
00:18:43.511 --> 00:18:45.220
<v Speaker 4>back and a double feature when,</v>

659
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.030
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

660
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:46.863
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>

661
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.651
<v Speaker 4>I think Friday,</v>

662
00:18:47.651 --> 00:18:48.490
<v Speaker 4>December 19th.</v>

663
00:18:48.491 --> 00:18:49.060
<v Speaker 4>You can look it up.</v>

664
00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.500
<v Speaker 4>New plans send them a.com.</v>

665
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.500
<v Speaker 1>If I'm home,</v>

666
00:18:51.501 --> 00:18:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to that.</v>

667
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

668
00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:53.773
<v Speaker 1>that sounds right.</v>

669
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.230
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that in a movie theater,</v>

670
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.640
<v Speaker 4>$8 double feature.</v>

671
00:18:56.641 --> 00:18:58.500
<v Speaker 4>They do a like $2 popcorn,</v>

672
00:18:58.501 --> 00:18:59.640
<v Speaker 4>$1 sodas.</v>

673
00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.260
<v Speaker 4>Why is Quintin Tarantino so cool?</v>

674
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:02.603
<v Speaker 4>It's unbelievable.</v>

675
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:03.930
<v Speaker 4>I have a,</v>

676
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:04.763
<v Speaker 4>I have a theory.</v>

677
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.150
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen him in person?</v>

678
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:06.601
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

679
00:19:06.601 --> 00:19:07.590
<v Speaker 4>the size of his hell.</v>

680
00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:08.730
<v Speaker 4>I'd never seen him in person,</v>

681
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:09.564
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>

682
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:10.021
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>

683
00:19:10.021 --> 00:19:10.650
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>

684
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:11.041
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

685
00:19:11.041 --> 00:19:12.600
<v Speaker 4>He's capturing and movies and stuff.</v>

686
00:19:12.601 --> 00:19:17.070
<v Speaker 4>The angle on his head is to make it look not as big as it is when you see him in</v>

687
00:19:17.071 --> 00:19:17.904
<v Speaker 4>real life.</v>

688
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:18.031
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

689
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:18.331
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

690
00:19:18.331 --> 00:19:19.130
<v Speaker 4>not disadvantage.</v>

691
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:19.320
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

692
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you the reason why he's so cool.</v>

693
00:19:21.601 --> 00:19:25.680
<v Speaker 4>It's because he has four times the brain matter that anybody else does.</v>

694
00:19:25.681 --> 00:19:26.790
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's what it is?</v>

695
00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:27.843
<v Speaker 4>It it.</v>

696
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.820
<v Speaker 4>It cannot be coincidence.</v>

697
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.300
<v Speaker 4>His head is twice as big as anybody else's in this room.</v>

698
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.770
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm talking like that Joe.</v>

699
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.830
<v Speaker 4>So you think you think there's just more matter in there?</v>

700
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.920
<v Speaker 4>I just find it hard to believe that it's coincidence that the guy with the</v>

701
00:19:40.921 --> 00:19:45.420
<v Speaker 4>biggest head that I've ever seen is also the genius.</v>

702
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

703
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:47.460
<v Speaker 1>He's also like a,</v>

704
00:19:47.461 --> 00:19:51.480
<v Speaker 1>he morphs into like what the people that he's around,</v>

705
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:52.741
<v Speaker 1>if you ever seen that,</v>

706
00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:55.920
<v Speaker 1>like he was on Howard stern show once and he was interviewed and he was talking</v>

707
00:19:55.921 --> 00:19:58.450
<v Speaker 1>one way and then he was on this all black show.</v>

708
00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

709
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.780
<v Speaker 1>And he was being interviewed and it was,</v>

710
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.500
<v Speaker 1>you were just like,</v>

711
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.333
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

712
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.633
<v Speaker 1>the Ab,</v>

713
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:09.570
<v Speaker 1>he fucking hammed it up so hard that I was like holding on my pants pockets.</v>

714
00:20:09.571 --> 00:20:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Like cringing like,</v>

715
00:20:10.831 --> 00:20:11.161
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

716
00:20:11.161 --> 00:20:11.994
<v Speaker 1>don't do this.</v>

717
00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:12.750

00:20:50.831 --> 00:20:51.101
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>look of film,</v>

755
00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.840
<v Speaker 4>well that's why he's making the lineups now at this theater.</v>

756
00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.670
<v Speaker 4>Like he's owned the theater for years.</v>

757
00:21:01.671 --> 00:21:02.720
<v Speaker 4>That's always been a thing.</v>

758
00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:03.111
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like,</v>

759
00:21:03.111 --> 00:21:04.730
<v Speaker 4>hey that's Quentin Tarantino's theater.</v>

760
00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.340
<v Speaker 4>But a few months ago he went in and the guy,</v>

761
00:21:07.341 --> 00:21:08.960
<v Speaker 4>I guess that ms managing it or whatever,</v>

762
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.720
<v Speaker 4>put it in the new projector and he goes,</v>

763
00:21:11.721 --> 00:21:14.470
<v Speaker 4>what's this like state of the art projector?</v>

764
00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.313
<v Speaker 4>And the guy's like,</v>

765
00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:15.561
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

766
00:21:15.561 --> 00:21:16.130
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

767
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.431
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

768
00:21:16.431 --> 00:21:16.910
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

769
00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:17.720
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

770
00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.553
<v Speaker 4>not cool.</v>

771
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:19.603
<v Speaker 4>You're done.</v>

772
00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:20.720
<v Speaker 4>Goodbye.</v>

773
00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm making the lineups now you're out of here.</v>

774
00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.170
<v Speaker 4>Something to that effect.</v>

775
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.300
<v Speaker 4>And so he makes the actual,</v>

776
00:21:26.301 --> 00:21:30.620
<v Speaker 4>like the movies that play these double features at his theater now are the</v>

777
00:21:30.621 --> 00:21:32.090
<v Speaker 4>movies that he would want to see.</v>

778
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.880
<v Speaker 1>So does he like edit them and splice them and stuff like that and put them in</v>

779
00:21:35.881 --> 00:21:36.391
<v Speaker 1>the reels?</v>

780
00:21:36.391 --> 00:21:36.721
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

781
00:21:36.721 --> 00:21:39.900
<v Speaker 1>is it one of those real to real things like the old school ones,</v>

782
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:41.620
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't go reel to reel.</v>

783
00:21:41.621 --> 00:21:43.380
<v Speaker 4>He puts a five minute and then her mission,</v>

784
00:21:43.381 --> 00:21:46.540
<v Speaker 4>an old school thing that says five minute intermission pops up</v>

785
00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.680
<v Speaker 1>and then he up the other second reel on.</v>

786
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

787
00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

788
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:50.570
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

789
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.580
<v Speaker 4>These are all the movies that inspired him and like you,</v>

790
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.430
<v Speaker 4>there's probably little things that you know he uses,</v>

791
00:21:56.431 --> 00:21:57.750
<v Speaker 4>pays homage to and things.</v>

792
00:21:57.751 --> 00:22:02.160
<v Speaker 4>And another cool thing is the previews before these newbies or the previous that</v>

793
00:22:02.161 --> 00:22:06.600
<v Speaker 4>for other of his mood for other movies that are playing there later that month.</v>

794
00:22:06.601 --> 00:22:10.920
<v Speaker 4>So you get to see the cool like 1980 preview for blank and blank,</v>

795
00:22:10.921 --> 00:22:12.370
<v Speaker 4>like whatever you get to see.</v>

796
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.780
<v Speaker 4>I saw one when I went to see unbreakable a couple of weeks ago,</v>

797
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:16.860
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

798
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.730
<v Speaker 4>for this Richard Pryor live and the Prefuse for Richard Pryor live.</v>

799
00:22:20.731 --> 00:22:22.350
<v Speaker 4>The ones that played are insane.</v>

800
00:22:22.351 --> 00:22:23.790
<v Speaker 4>You would never believe these.</v>

801
00:22:23.791 --> 00:22:25.860
<v Speaker 4>So different than any type of Promo.</v>

802
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.581
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>

803
00:22:26.581 --> 00:22:27.414
<v Speaker 4>Like in what way?</v>

804
00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.260
<v Speaker 4>Oh God no.</v>

805
00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.570
<v Speaker 4>If that's something you'd have to see to believe.</v>

806
00:22:30.571 --> 00:22:31.520
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just it,</v>

807
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.180
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember exactly,</v>

808
00:22:33.181 --> 00:22:34.800
<v Speaker 4>but it's just crazy.</v>

809
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:40.130
<v Speaker 4>If you look up like the trailer for a Richard Pryor live,</v>

810
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.480
<v Speaker 4>I think the one for the sunset strip,</v>

811
00:22:42.481 --> 00:22:44.370
<v Speaker 4>like I can't remember exactly what's happening,</v>

812
00:22:44.371 --> 00:22:49.371
<v Speaker 4>but I remember thinking if anybody did a promo for their special like this was</v>

813
00:22:49.381 --> 00:22:50.010
<v Speaker 4>done,</v>

814
00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.480

818
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.900

1012
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.140
<v Speaker 4>he's a dialogue driven guy.</v>

1013
00:28:22.141 --> 00:28:23.790
<v Speaker 4>So when that guy didn't answer his,</v>

1014
00:28:23.791 --> 00:28:24.720
<v Speaker 4>what are you filming?</v>

1015
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:26.400
<v Speaker 4>You watched the switch and he goes,</v>

1016
00:28:26.401 --> 00:28:26.540
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1017
00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.630
<v Speaker 4>He goes from what is this?</v>

1018
00:28:27.631 --> 00:28:31.440
<v Speaker 4>And he's still normal to that guy not answering and his eyes just,</v>

1019
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:32.660
<v Speaker 4>he loses it.</v>

1020
00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:36.050
<v Speaker 5>Well there's also that weird moment when like he's trying to play it cool when</v>

1021
00:28:36.051 --> 00:28:36.890
<v Speaker 5>the guys go on,</v>

1022
00:28:36.891 --> 00:28:37.191
<v Speaker 5>come on.</v>

1023
00:28:37.191 --> 00:28:37.790
<v Speaker 5>Go for it was like,</v>

1024
00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:38.270
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1025
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:38.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't think,</v>

1026
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.630
<v Speaker 5>cause you could feel the tension between the two of them.</v>

1027
00:28:41.631 --> 00:28:43.140
<v Speaker 5>They just had a physical altercation,</v>

1028
00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:44.223
<v Speaker 5>altercation,</v>

1029
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.140
<v Speaker 5>but he's still trying to like maintain like social calmness.</v>

1030
00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:49.341
<v Speaker 5>It's very weird,</v>

1031
00:28:49.341 --> 00:28:49.610
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1032
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:50.443
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1033
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:52.640
<v Speaker 5>Watching conflict is fucking weird.</v>

1034
00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.540
<v Speaker 5>It's always weird cause you can like sense like how you would be in that</v>

1035
00:28:56.541 --> 00:28:57.260
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>

1036
00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.400
<v Speaker 5>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

1037
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.260
<v Speaker 5>This is why people love drama.</v>

1038
00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.900
<v Speaker 5>They love like feeling it without having to be a part of it.</v>

1039
00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:03.750
<v Speaker 5>You know that,</v>

1040
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.220
<v Speaker 5>that's why people love movies that are fucking crazy dramatic.</v>

1041
00:29:07.221 --> 00:29:08.510
<v Speaker 5>As long as they end happily,</v>

1042
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.270
<v Speaker 5>people get like super bummed when movies don't end right.</v>

1043
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.470
<v Speaker 5>Because part of us,</v>

1044
00:29:12.471 --> 00:29:13.370
<v Speaker 5>when you're watching a movie,</v>

1045
00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:16.700
<v Speaker 5>you're somehow or another invested in these people that you're following.</v>

1046
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.013
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1047
00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.550
<v Speaker 5>That's why when they get into conflict,</v>

1048
00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:20.541
<v Speaker 5>it's so exciting.</v>

1049
00:29:20.541 --> 00:29:21.770
<v Speaker 5>Even though you know it's bullshit.</v>

1050
00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.050
<v Speaker 5>But when you see real conflict like that,</v>

1051
00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:26.870
<v Speaker 5>there's something like weirdly exciting about it,</v>

1052
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:28.063
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1053
00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:29.361
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1054
00:29:29.361 --> 00:29:30.350
<v Speaker 5>It is a sick drill.</v>

1055
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:31.841
<v Speaker 5>It's awful.</v>

1056
00:29:31.841 --> 00:29:33.110
<v Speaker 5>It fucking makes you tingle.</v>

1057
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.143
<v Speaker 5>A blizzard</v>

1058
00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.540
<v Speaker 5>after an argument,</v>

1059
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.350
<v Speaker 5>but he helped you get out of a fucking snow bank.</v>

1060
00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.300
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever seek death proof?</v>

1061
00:29:43.301 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 5>The one where Kurt Russell plays a stunt man.</v>

1062
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.590
<v Speaker 5>It's a serial killer with his stunt car.</v>

1063
00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.513
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1064
00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:48.971
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1065
00:29:48.971 --> 00:29:49.710
<v Speaker 5>is that a term?</v>

1066
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:50.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1067
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:51.970
<v Speaker 5>but what happened was grinder.</v>

1068
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:52.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:53.130
<v Speaker 5>When they made the,</v>

1070
00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:54.430
<v Speaker 5>when they made the double feature,</v>

1071
00:29:54.431 --> 00:29:58.150
<v Speaker 5>Rodriguez is movie went first and Terentino's when second and it's tough to</v>

1072
00:29:58.151 --> 00:30:03.151
<v Speaker 5>follow an hour and a half long Rodriguez action movie and that's what happened.</v>

1073
00:30:03.341 --> 00:30:05.290
<v Speaker 5>And they put it out as a modern day double feature,</v>

1074
00:30:05.291 --> 00:30:07.240
<v Speaker 5>but it's sort of buried this movie,</v>

1075
00:30:07.241 --> 00:30:08.440
<v Speaker 5>the Terantin oh maid,</v>

1076
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:09.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1077
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:14.140
<v Speaker 5>and it's very Tarantino and very cool and almost completely sort of unknown</v>

1078
00:30:14.141 --> 00:30:15.790
<v Speaker 5>about compared to his other movies.</v>

1079
00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:16.240
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1080
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:16.781
<v Speaker 5>What's it called?</v>

1081
00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:17.614
<v Speaker 5>Death proof.</v>

1082
00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:18.573
<v Speaker 5>Kurt Russell.</v>

1083
00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.200
<v Speaker 5>See those movies?</v>

1084
00:30:20.201 --> 00:30:24.460
<v Speaker 5>Because I just like all your saw the commercials for whatever reason or never</v>

1085
00:30:24.461 --> 00:30:25.390
<v Speaker 5>got around to seeing them.</v>

1086
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:26.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1087
00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.760
<v Speaker 5>It looks like it might be fun to watch,</v>

1088
00:30:27.761 --> 00:30:29.380
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know,</v>

1089
00:30:29.381 --> 00:30:29.591
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1090
00:30:29.591 --> 00:30:30.011
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to,</v>

1091
00:30:30.011 --> 00:30:31.420
<v Speaker 5>the movies can be so brutal.</v>

1092
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:32.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:34.660
<v Speaker 5>You're risking people not talking.</v>

1094
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:36.130
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1095
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:37.660
<v Speaker 5>you're risking it and it happens.</v>

1096
00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.800
<v Speaker 5>It happens every other time.</v>

1097
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:39.910
<v Speaker 5>Every other time we go to the movie,</v>

1098
00:30:39.911 --> 00:30:43.240
<v Speaker 5>someone's just having a fucking converse and the rappers and the popcorn.</v>

1099
00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.780
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand how popcorn became the fucking movie thing.</v>

1100
00:30:46.781 --> 00:30:48.010
<v Speaker 5>It's the loudest food.</v>

1101
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.060
<v Speaker 5>She'd be like Jello.</v>

1102
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:53.090
<v Speaker 5>She'd be cello or milkshakes or something.</v>

1103
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:58.100
<v Speaker 5>It's popcorn is just [inaudible] it's true in the bag and everything about</v>

1104
00:30:58.331 --> 00:31:00.640
<v Speaker 5>popcorns loud popcorn is like Turkey.</v>

1105
00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:02.910
<v Speaker 5>Like how the fuck did it become king of Thanksgiving,</v>

1106
00:31:02.911 --> 00:31:03.744
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1107
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:07.150
<v Speaker 5>I mean is there any real evidence those motherfuckers reading turkeys?</v>

1108
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.440
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1109
00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.730
<v Speaker 5>Why is it this one food,</v>

1110
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.310
<v Speaker 5>they may have been eating popcorn for all we know.</v>

1111
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:12.761
<v Speaker 5>Well they didn't.</v>

1112
00:31:12.761 --> 00:31:14.290
<v Speaker 5>Their corn was like goofy back then.</v>

1113
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1114
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.130
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1115
00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.520
<v Speaker 5>you ever see what old corn looks like?</v>

1116
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.520
<v Speaker 5>Like non GMO corn.</v>

1117
00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.600
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the things that people like,</v>

1118
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.940
<v Speaker 5>Ooh Jumo fuck goons scourge GMO.</v>

1119
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:23.081
<v Speaker 5>If you look,</v>

1120
00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:25.300
<v Speaker 5>look at what GMO actually is.</v>

1121
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.140
<v Speaker 5>Like not,</v>

1122
00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.520
<v Speaker 5>not just like changing the,</v>

1123
00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:28.931
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1124
00:31:28.931 --> 00:31:30.630
<v Speaker 5>these plants so that they uh,</v>

1125
00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:33.250
<v Speaker 5>they can deal with pesticides better and doing,</v>

1126
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.810
<v Speaker 5>they do a lot of weird shit today.</v>

1127
00:31:34.811 --> 00:31:37.540
<v Speaker 5>That's like super scientific gene splicing type shit.</v>

1128
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:41.830
<v Speaker 5>But genetically modifying like everything that we eat is like modified.</v>

1129
00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:44.450
<v Speaker 5>They've like selectively bred everything that we eat.</v>

1130
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.820
<v Speaker 5>Like corn used to be the scrappy little fucking dainty thing and now it's these</v>

1131
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.280
<v Speaker 5>big ass Iowa ears,</v>

1132
00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.910
<v Speaker 5>you know all those,</v>

1133
00:31:54.911 --> 00:31:56.260
<v Speaker 5>like our tomatoes,</v>

1134
00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.430
<v Speaker 5>all of our apples,</v>

1135
00:31:57.431 --> 00:31:58.990
<v Speaker 5>like all that stuff's been engineered.</v>

1136
00:31:59.250 --> 00:31:59.510
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1137
00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:01.120
<v Speaker 5>it hasn't all been done in a lab,</v>

1138
00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:02.350
<v Speaker 5>but it's all been like we've,</v>

1139
00:32:02.351 --> 00:32:07.351
<v Speaker 5>they've made these crops like very in a specific manner so that they have a</v>

1140
00:32:08.201 --> 00:32:09.190
<v Speaker 5>higher yield.</v>

1141
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.760
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever see king corn now everybody should see that movie.</v>

1142
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:13.900
<v Speaker 5>It's a freak out.</v>

1143
00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.640
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] was the best part in it.</v>

1144
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:18.640
<v Speaker 5>When they should a big hole in the side of a cow and they're just reaching in</v>

1145
00:32:18.641 --> 00:32:19.290
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1146
00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:19.780
<v Speaker 5>That's on,</v>

1147
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.900
<v Speaker 5>that's in food inc to have that food bank as well.</v>

1148
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:27.100
<v Speaker 5>Like whenever they want to talk about like feeding cattle grain,</v>

1149
00:32:27.101 --> 00:32:29.230
<v Speaker 5>they always show these cows and have these open,</v>

1150
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what exactly they're doing,</v>

1151
00:32:31.001 --> 00:32:32.230
<v Speaker 5>but they have these open hole.</v>

1152
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:32.501
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1153
00:32:32.501 --> 00:32:35.680
<v Speaker 5>you could literally reach into the cow's stomach so they have a hole on the</v>

1154
00:32:35.681 --> 00:32:38.980
<v Speaker 5>outside of their body and you could reach your hand into that hole and actually</v>

1155
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.850
<v Speaker 5>pull the food out of this cow stomach.</v>

1156
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:43.730
<v Speaker 5>Did they develop abscesses?</v>

1157
00:32:43.731 --> 00:32:47.990
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes from eating grains and eating things that like their body just doesn't</v>

1158
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:50.510
<v Speaker 5>want to process and then they're there.</v>

1159
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:51.290
<v Speaker 5>They're pumping.</v>

1160
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:55.700
<v Speaker 5>I'm filled with fucking antibiotics that just jack and their system up and these</v>

1161
00:32:55.701 --> 00:32:56.750
<v Speaker 5>fucking house,</v>

1162
00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:57.890
<v Speaker 5>like if you,</v>

1163
00:32:57.891 --> 00:32:59.660
<v Speaker 5>if you watch this video and you see this,</v>

1164
00:32:59.661 --> 00:33:03.230
<v Speaker 5>this whole in the cow or like you're looking into its stomach,</v>

1165
00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:03.740
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1166
00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.240
<v Speaker 5>what is wrong with people?</v>

1167
00:33:05.241 --> 00:33:06.290
<v Speaker 5>Like what are we doing?</v>

1168
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:07.423
<v Speaker 5>Like what,</v>

1169
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:08.270
<v Speaker 5>how do you,</v>

1170
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.320
<v Speaker 5>how is this okay?</v>

1171
00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.740
<v Speaker 5>Like how is it okay to have a hole in the cow side?</v>

1172
00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:15.340
<v Speaker 5>We could reach your hand in and just like it's,</v>

1173
00:33:15.341 --> 00:33:19.040
<v Speaker 5>it's that fucked up that it's like its stomach is outside of its body.</v>

1174
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.440
<v Speaker 5>See if he could pull that up just so we could see it from,</v>

1175
00:33:21.441 --> 00:33:22.370
<v Speaker 5>these guys haven't seen it.</v>

1176
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.211
<v Speaker 5>And what does that do?</v>

1177
00:33:23.211 --> 00:33:23.420
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

1178
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.650
<v Speaker 5>it makes the,</v>

1179
00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.350
<v Speaker 5>they do it to treat the cows because the cows start getting,</v>

1180
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:29.990
<v Speaker 5>I think they do it for different reasons,</v>

1181
00:33:29.991 --> 00:33:34.991
<v Speaker 5>but I think one of the main ones is that when these cows are eating grains and</v>

1182
00:33:35.421 --> 00:33:35.561
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

1183
00:33:35.561 --> 00:33:36.590
<v Speaker 5>they're getting sick,</v>

1184
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:40.700
<v Speaker 5>they developed these abscesses in their body and um,</v>

1185
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:42.260
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what it is with Kelsey.</v>

1186
00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.093
<v Speaker 5>That's that.</v>

1187
00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.900
<v Speaker 5>That's where the cow's stomach is.</v>

1188
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.610
<v Speaker 5>It looks like a joke or something.</v>

1189
00:33:46.611 --> 00:33:46.991
<v Speaker 5>Like a,</v>

1190
00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:48.620
<v Speaker 5>a photo shop.</v>

1191
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:49.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1192
00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:50.110
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1193
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:52.730
<v Speaker 5>but coins in around the edges.</v>

1194
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.010
<v Speaker 5>I should know the whole reason why they do it,</v>

1195
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:58.790
<v Speaker 5>but it's one of the main reasons why people are propublic.</v>

1196
00:33:58.791 --> 00:34:00.010
<v Speaker 5>He's got his hand in that guys.</v>

1197
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.230
<v Speaker 5>Oh my goodness.</v>

1198
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.880
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the main reasons why people were like trying to go back to grass fed</v>

1199
00:34:07.881 --> 00:34:08.714
<v Speaker 5>beef.</v>

1200
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:10.790
<v Speaker 5>Like if you have grass fed beef,</v>

1201
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.070
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to be as juicy.</v>

1202
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:14.300
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to be as fat.</v>

1203
00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.100
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to be like when you cook a Ribeye,</v>

1204
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:17.960
<v Speaker 5>like a corn fed rib eye.</v>

1205
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.040
<v Speaker 5>Oh my goodness.</v>

1206
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.290
<v Speaker 5>They're just crackling with fat and it's just,</v>

1207
00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:22.310
<v Speaker 5>it's so good.</v>

1208
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.100
<v Speaker 5>But that animal's sick.</v>

1209
00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.880
<v Speaker 5>Like it's not a healthy animal.</v>

1210
00:34:25.881 --> 00:34:27.170
<v Speaker 5>It's got that all that fat,</v>

1211
00:34:27.171 --> 00:34:28.004
<v Speaker 5>it's body.</v>

1212
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:29.250
<v Speaker 5>What's going on?</v>

1213
00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:29.530
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1214
00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:30.810
<v Speaker 5>it's this custody.</v>

1215
00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:33.420
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1216
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.750
<v Speaker 5>when she's pulling the matter out of the cow's body.</v>

1217
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1218
00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:38.780
<v Speaker 5>He said they were doing it to help the cow.</v>

1219
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:40.700
<v Speaker 5>I think in that situation,</v>

1220
00:34:40.701 --> 00:34:41.511
<v Speaker 5>when they have that out,</v>

1221
00:34:41.511 --> 00:34:44.240
<v Speaker 5>that ring on the outside of it and they're reaching into the cow's stomach,</v>

1222
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:46.310
<v Speaker 5>I think they'd do it because the cows Foxville.</v>

1223
00:34:46.311 --> 00:34:47.144
<v Speaker 5>If they don't,</v>

1224
00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.880
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand it totally.</v>

1225
00:34:49.881 --> 00:34:51.020
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't be talking about it,</v>

1226
00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:52.490
<v Speaker 5>but whatever it is is bad.</v>

1227
00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:54.230
<v Speaker 5>Fucking disgusting.</v>

1228
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:55.161
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1229
00:34:55.161 --> 00:34:57.950
<v Speaker 5>can I just vomit this whole documentary?</v>

1230
00:34:57.951 --> 00:35:01.670
<v Speaker 5>King corn was all about corn and how much corn is in our food and they go</v>

1231
00:35:01.671 --> 00:35:02.180
<v Speaker 5>through these,</v>

1232
00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.810
<v Speaker 5>these college kids that go through the supermarket and just start pulling things</v>

1233
00:35:05.811 --> 00:35:09.140
<v Speaker 5>off the shelves and recognizing how much of everything has corn in it.</v>

1234
00:35:09.141 --> 00:35:09.921
<v Speaker 5>And then they do this,</v>

1235
00:35:09.921 --> 00:35:12.200
<v Speaker 5>this test on their own body and their,</v>

1236
00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.480
<v Speaker 5>it found out their bodies like mostly corn.</v>

1237
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:17.720
<v Speaker 5>Like most of the carbon in their body came from corn or whatever the fuck it</v>

1238
00:35:17.721 --> 00:35:17.931
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>

1239
00:35:17.931 --> 00:35:19.730
<v Speaker 5>But it's one of those things where you,</v>

1240
00:35:19.731 --> 00:35:20.564
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1241
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.433
<v Speaker 5>they take you,</v>

1242
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:23.660
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1243
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:27.500
<v Speaker 5>You can stick his hand in the whole of the whole workout.</v>

1244
00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:34.550
<v Speaker 5>You son of a B Hinchcliffe yeah,</v>

1245
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:35.803
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

1246
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.201
<v Speaker 5>I dunno,</v>

1247
00:35:36.201 --> 00:35:37.034
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1248
00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 5>it's a very</v>

1249
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.843
<v Speaker 1>weird thing,</v>

1250
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.580
<v Speaker 1>but you can just stick your hand in to someone's,</v>

1251

<v Speaker 1>It looks like a piggy bank saying like the circle.</v>

1254
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:47.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1255
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.480

<v Speaker 1>La Jolla here.</v>

1295
00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:46.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing that's weird about doing comedy in La.</v>

1296
00:36:46.061 --> 00:36:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Like la has a kind of specific crowd and a lot of ways and there's some shit</v>

1297
00:36:50.831 --> 00:36:55.831
<v Speaker 1>that you can do in La that literally won't fly anywhere else in the flyover.</v>

1298
00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:56.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1299
00:36:56.741 --> 00:36:57.011
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1300
00:36:57.011 --> 00:37:00.110
<v Speaker 1>there's certain shit that you can do here in this town like,</v>

1301
00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:02.890
<v Speaker 1>like it has a very certain sensibility almost all towns do.</v>

1302
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Like Boston was famous for having a Boston sense of humor,</v>

1303
00:37:06.311 --> 00:37:09.160
<v Speaker 1>a lot of Boston related material that didn't work anywhere else.</v>

1304
00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.360
<v Speaker 1>So like this,</v>

1305
00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:13.360
<v Speaker 1>one of the best things to do is a go to as many different spots.</v>

1306
00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys find that it's very different?</v>

1307
00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.770
<v Speaker 1>The crowds he experienced the comedy store versus the road?</v>

1308
00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:18.281
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1309
00:37:18.281 --> 00:37:18.760
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1310
00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.020
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's harder here.</v>

1311
00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:23.800
<v Speaker 3>The crowds are harder in la because I feel like everyone's just used to watching</v>

1312
00:37:23.801 --> 00:37:25.300
<v Speaker 3>entertainment all the time.</v>

1313
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:28.450
<v Speaker 3>All the time and auditions and like different shows and Improv.</v>

1314
00:37:28.451 --> 00:37:31.210
<v Speaker 3>So people are just used to seeing other people try to,</v>

1315
00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:31.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1316
00:37:31.601 --> 00:37:32.500
<v Speaker 3>work their craft.</v>

1317
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:32.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1318
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:35.270
<v Speaker 3>Here when I went to Bray,</v>

1319
00:37:35.271 --> 00:37:35.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1320
00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.910
<v Speaker 3>which isn't even that far,</v>

1321
00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:37.691
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1322
00:37:37.691 --> 00:37:38.524
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1323
00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:42.820
<v Speaker 3>I need to get out of La Cause Bray is not that far and I get there and I'm kind</v>

1324
00:37:42.821 --> 00:37:44.800
<v Speaker 3>of like dry and like they just like,</v>

1325
00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:46.840
<v Speaker 3>it was just like this weird disconnect.</v>

1326
00:37:46.841 --> 00:37:48.820
<v Speaker 3>And that was a moment where I was like,</v>

1327
00:37:48.821 --> 00:37:49.061
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1328
00:37:49.061 --> 00:37:50.560
<v Speaker 3>I just got to keep going other places.</v>

1329
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1330
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:51.991
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1331
00:37:51.991 --> 00:37:53.070
<v Speaker 1>here's the other difference.</v>

1332
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.570
<v Speaker 1>There's people that come to a place,</v>

1333
00:37:54.571 --> 00:37:58.320
<v Speaker 1>like the comedy store and they're used to seeing a lot of experimentation,</v>

1334
00:37:58.321 --> 00:37:59.580
<v Speaker 1>a lot of new material.</v>

1335
00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:01.500
<v Speaker 1>But when you're in a club like Braya,</v>

1336
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.690
<v Speaker 1>like you got headliners coming in every week.</v>

1337
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what it's like.</v>

1338
00:38:04.891 --> 00:38:06.870
<v Speaker 1>The Bray improv headlines coming every week.</v>

1339
00:38:06.871 --> 00:38:08.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's what those people say.</v>

1340
00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:08.881
<v Speaker 1>They go there,</v>

1341
00:38:08.881 --> 00:38:09.960
<v Speaker 1>they see this guy kill,</v>

1342
00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:11.030
<v Speaker 1>they see that God kill.</v>

1343
00:38:11.031 --> 00:38:11.940
<v Speaker 1>They see this girl kill.</v>

1344
00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.040
<v Speaker 1>And when you do that over and over and over again,</v>

1345
00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:14.280
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1346
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.720
<v Speaker 1>you sees in your crowd.</v>

1347
00:38:15.721 --> 00:38:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at the lineup of like the Improv and Brio,</v>

1348
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:20.280
<v Speaker 1>it's just a murderer after murderer.</v>

1349
00:38:20.281 --> 00:38:23.310
<v Speaker 1>It's just a sterile assassins and they're all coming in for the weekends.</v>

1350
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:23.881
<v Speaker 1>So like you,</v>

1351
00:38:23.881 --> 00:38:27.840
<v Speaker 1>you have like this whole system there where people were accustomed to a very</v>

1352
00:38:27.841 --> 00:38:30.450
<v Speaker 1>high level of like national level comedy.</v>

1353
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:31.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1354
00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:32.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it's easier.</v>

1355
00:38:32.851 --> 00:38:34.740
<v Speaker 1>This places a lot easier.</v>

1356
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1357
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1358
00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1359
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:37.031
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1360
00:38:37.031 --> 00:38:37.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1361
00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:41.740
<v Speaker 1>the thing about those places is they're not as open to experimentation though.</v>

1362
00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1363
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1364
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.850
<v Speaker 1>And I was hosting the weekend.</v>

1365
00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I like knew what I was doing,</v>

1366
00:38:46.901 --> 00:38:48.790
<v Speaker 1>but it was such a good experience.</v>

1367
00:38:48.791 --> 00:38:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Cause that Friday I was like,</v>

1368
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:51.543
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1369
00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:53.423
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1370
00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.620
<v Speaker 1>La has the more educated as far as like comedy style,</v>

1371
00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:01.640
<v Speaker 1>like hack stuff doesn't go over in la the way we'll go over in some places like,</v>

1372
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.510
<v Speaker 1>but that's harder to do any more anyway.</v>

1373
00:39:04.511 --> 00:39:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it like hacks.</v>

1374
00:39:05.391 --> 00:39:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

1375
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Like you really,</v>

1376
00:39:06.491 --> 00:39:07.510
<v Speaker 1>it's all worn out.</v>

1377
00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1378
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't exist anymore.</v>

1379
00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1380
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1381
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:12.280
<v Speaker 1>where's the last guy that you heard was a hack?</v>

1382
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:14.280
<v Speaker 1>I just do an hack Joe's.</v>

1383
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:15.760
<v Speaker 4>We see them every day.</v>

1384
00:39:15.761 --> 00:39:16.091
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1385
00:39:16.091 --> 00:39:16.421
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1386
00:39:16.421 --> 00:39:17.300
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1387
00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:17.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1388
00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.350
<v Speaker 4>anybody who's on a lineup in front of me,</v>

1389
00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:23.120
<v Speaker 4>they mean if it's not like if they,</v>

1390
00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1391
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1392
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.840
<v Speaker 4>they better be good or else I will.</v>

1393
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.450
<v Speaker 4>I will complain about them being in front of me on a lineup no matter how long</v>

1394
00:39:31.451 --> 00:39:33.030
<v Speaker 4>they've been to one and no matter whatever.</v>

1395
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:33.671
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1396
00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:35.830
<v Speaker 4>It's just like if I hear a bad joke,</v>

1397
00:39:35.831 --> 00:39:36.580
<v Speaker 4>I just go,</v>

1398
00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.730
<v Speaker 4>why is this person have a better spot than they made in fury?</v>

1399
00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:39.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1400
00:39:39.951 --> 00:39:41.120
<v Speaker 1>you just made it really personal.</v>

1401
00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:43.650
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I'm [inaudible] about.</v>

1402
00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:44.690
<v Speaker 1>I'll call them a hack,</v>

1403
00:39:44.691 --> 00:39:45.320
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1404
00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.250
<v Speaker 1>And not to their face.</v>

1405
00:39:46.251 --> 00:39:47.360
<v Speaker 1>You run into that though.</v>

1406
00:39:47.361 --> 00:39:48.194
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that?</v>

1407
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that anymore.</v>

1408
00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:50.690
<v Speaker 1>I really don't see hacks any,</v>

1409
00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1410
00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1411
00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I remember like they used to be guys who had like a stock act,</v>

1412
00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:55.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1413
00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.150
<v Speaker 1>They had an act that was just interchangeable with a lot of other people's acts</v>

1414
00:39:59.151 --> 00:40:03.020
<v Speaker 1>and it was based on these like really common premises like okay,</v>

1415
00:40:03.021 --> 00:40:04.070
<v Speaker 1>here's a perfect example.</v>

1416
00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:09.140
<v Speaker 1>A guy going to buy tampons for his wife and he would get to the counter and the</v>

1417
00:40:09.141 --> 00:40:13.310
<v Speaker 1>thing wouldn't have a tag on it and they would go price check tampons,</v>

1418
00:40:13.311 --> 00:40:14.144
<v Speaker 1>Aisle Alto.</v>

1419
00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:18.470
<v Speaker 1>There was a hundred guys who did that joke and they're like,</v>

1420
00:40:18.471 --> 00:40:18.861
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>

1421
00:40:18.861 --> 00:40:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I'll pay you twice.</v>

1422
00:40:19.731 --> 00:40:21.920
<v Speaker 1>The money just don't do that.</v>

1423
00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:22.940
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that again.</v>

1424
00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:23.621
<v Speaker 1>How much is it?</v>

1425
00:40:23.621 --> 00:40:24.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it's $50 sir.</v>

1426
00:40:24.621 --> 00:40:25.454
<v Speaker 1>That's too much.</v>

1427
00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.560
<v Speaker 1>I saw so many people do that joke.</v>

1428
00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was one of those things where it was like,</v>

1429
00:40:29.481 --> 00:40:30.081
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1430
00:40:30.081 --> 00:40:31.010
<v Speaker 1>this is out of control.</v>

1431
00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:32.300
<v Speaker 1>There was like that premise.</v>

1432
00:40:32.301 --> 00:40:34.910
<v Speaker 1>It was like a super common hack premise.</v>

1433
00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1434
00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:36.710
<v Speaker 1>cops and donuts.</v>

00:41:35.871 --> 00:41:36.770
<v Speaker 1>what's not acceptable.</v>

1463
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some dumb shit that's really funny.</v>

1464
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:42.770
<v Speaker 1>You know like it doesn't have to all be smart like in,</v>

1465
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:46.040
<v Speaker 1>it can be a stew of things like burn.</v>

1466
00:41:46.041 --> 00:41:49.460
<v Speaker 1>I were talking the other day about pratfalls like he has this bit and he was</v>

1467
00:41:49.461 --> 00:41:50.720
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how to,</v>

1468
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:54.650
<v Speaker 1>how to like almost get like flipped on stage.</v>

1469
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:58.820
<v Speaker 1>And I can't talk about it without like sort of reveal on the premise.</v>

1470
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:59.990
<v Speaker 1>So he and I were like,</v>

1471
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.500
<v Speaker 1>I was showing him like these different roles that you could do a different way.</v>

1472
00:42:03.501 --> 00:42:05.060
<v Speaker 1>You could fall where you're not going to get hurt,</v>

1473
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:06.270
<v Speaker 1>but it'll look kind of crazy.</v>

1474
00:42:06.271 --> 00:42:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Your legs be over the air.</v>

1475
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:08.391
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1476
00:42:08.391 --> 00:42:08.810
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

1477
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:09.650
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about like,</v>

1478
00:42:09.651 --> 00:42:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Prat falls like pratfalls aren't cheap.</v>

1479
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:12.081
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1480
00:42:12.081 --> 00:42:12.320
<v Speaker 1>If it's,</v>

1481
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:12.621
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1482
00:42:12.621 --> 00:42:13.040
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

1483
00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.010
<v Speaker 1>if it's a part of a joke and it makes the joke better,</v>

1484
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:16.993
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

1485
00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:17.650
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1486

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1487
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:20.450
<v Speaker 1>But there's some people who would back off because they worried about the</v>

1488
00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:21.830
<v Speaker 1>contempt of their peers,</v>

1489
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:22.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1490
00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:22.970
<v Speaker 1>they worry about,</v>

1491
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:23.380
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1492
00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:23.991
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

1493
00:42:23.991 --> 00:42:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Flips on stage now.</v>

1494
00:42:25.101 --> 00:42:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Tony Hinge also</v>

1495
00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:27.551
<v Speaker 4>comedian,</v>

1496
00:42:27.551 --> 00:42:28.430
<v Speaker 4>like I like,</v>

1497
00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:29.171
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1498
00:42:29.171 --> 00:42:32.140
<v Speaker 4>somebody who moves around and stuff like that.</v>

1499
00:42:32.141 --> 00:42:33.610
<v Speaker 4>If that's part of their natural thing,</v>

1500
00:42:33.611 --> 00:42:33.911
<v Speaker 4>then yeah,</v>

1501
00:42:33.911 --> 00:42:34.601
<v Speaker 4>they could do that.</v>

1502
00:42:34.601 --> 00:42:35.200
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1503
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.033
<v Speaker 4>some people,</v>

1504
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:37.221
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz,</v>

1505
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:38.450
<v Speaker 1>one Joey moves around a lot,</v>

1506
00:42:38.451 --> 00:42:39.350
<v Speaker 1>but it keeps the mic and this,</v>

1507
00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:41.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't picture him doing Pratt off,</v>

1508
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:42.231
<v Speaker 1>but he's done some,</v>

1509
00:42:42.231 --> 00:42:43.460
<v Speaker 1>some karate kicks on stage.</v>

1510
00:42:43.461 --> 00:42:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that really.</v>

1511
00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1512
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Joey gets crazy sometimes.</v>

1513
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:46.940
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1514
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.320
<v Speaker 1>but he always keeps the mic in the stand.</v>

1515
00:42:48.321 --> 00:42:49.550
<v Speaker 1>If you noticed that about Diaz,</v>

1516
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:50.930
<v Speaker 1>he never holds the mic.</v>

1517
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Ah.</v>

1518
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.770
<v Speaker 1>He uses both of his hands and it keeps the mic in the stand.</v>

1519
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.310
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the few guys that do that.</v>

1520
00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1521
00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.200
<v Speaker 1>he's got a totally different style,</v>

1522
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:58.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1523
00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:58.731
<v Speaker 1>but it works,</v>

1524
00:42:58.731 --> 00:42:59.490
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1525
00:42:59.490 --> 00:42:59.810
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1526
00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:03.020
<v Speaker 1>he's a master of having that microphone in the stand.</v>

1527
00:43:03.021 --> 00:43:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1528
00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:04.830
<v Speaker 4>I love what he does when he's killing.</v>

1529
00:43:04.831 --> 00:43:06.380
<v Speaker 4>He grabs it by its side and he looks,</v>

1530
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:07.051
<v Speaker 4>it's straight up,</v>

1531
00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:07.884
<v Speaker 4>a few inches</v>

1532
00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:08.610
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1533
00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:09.411
<v Speaker 1>You just hear that the,</v>

1534
00:43:09.411 --> 00:43:09.620
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1535
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:10.920
<v Speaker 1>the debate is on the monster.</v>

1536
00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.260
<v Speaker 1>He's got this new bit about Isis.</v>

1537
00:43:13.261 --> 00:43:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking,</v>

1538
00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.170
<v Speaker 1>tears were pouring down my eyes.</v>

1539
00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.090
<v Speaker 1>He was a red,</v>

1540
00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:23.120
<v Speaker 1>like a beat and screaming at the top of his lungs and the water and sweat was</v>

1541
00:43:23.521 --> 00:43:26.550
<v Speaker 1>flying and he's taking his jacket off while he's killing,</v>

1542
00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:27.301
<v Speaker 1>while he's,</v>

1543
00:43:27.301 --> 00:43:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Kelly used to take his jacket off to in this isis bit.</v>

1544
00:43:30.181 --> 00:43:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1545
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:31.470
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:33.780
<v Speaker 1>He's the best ever.</v>

1548
00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1550
00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:35.101

1551
00:43:35.101 --> 00:43:36.540
<v Speaker 1>if you never seen Joey Diaz live,</v>

1552
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:37.383
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand.</v>

1553
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:40.260
<v Speaker 1>There's another level and he's a perfect example.</v>

1554
00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no like great intellectual truths in his act.</v>

1555
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.870
<v Speaker 1>It's shit that he thinks is fucking funny.</v>

1556
00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:47.760
<v Speaker 1>He's just tried to kill,</v>

1557
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.520
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to say the funniest shit that he could say.</v>

1558
00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1559
00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:51.271
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

00:43:51.271 --> 00:43:52.470
<v Speaker 1>and in doing that,</v>

1561
00:43:52.471 --> 00:43:53.304
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1566
00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:03.690

1567
00:44:03.691 --> 00:44:04.441
<v Speaker 1>that level.</v>

1568
00:44:04.441 --> 00:44:04.891
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

1569
00:44:04.891 --> 00:44:09.891
<v Speaker 1>there's a level of crying in the crowd during some of his bits and people just</v>

1570
00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.110
<v Speaker 1>hitting tables because they can't breathe.</v>

1576
00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:22.450
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the fun things about the sitting in the back of a comedy room is</v>

1577
00:44:22.451 --> 00:44:23.890
<v Speaker 4>you get to see the shadows,</v>

1578
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:25.510
<v Speaker 4>the people in front of you,</v>

1579
00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:28.390
<v Speaker 4>how they're physically moving different than the rest of the show.</v>

1580
00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:29.231
<v Speaker 4>Rest of the show.</v>

1581
00:44:29.231 --> 00:44:30.011
<v Speaker 4>They're pretty still,</v>

1582
00:44:30.011 --> 00:44:32.550
<v Speaker 4>like you might see them pop and down for laughs and stuff.</v>

1583
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:35.130
<v Speaker 4>But if you're sitting in the back during a Joey Diaz said,</v>

1584
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:38.310
<v Speaker 4>it's like you see like spit takes flying in the air.</v>

1585
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:41.880
<v Speaker 4>One guy falling out of his seat and other guys slamming a table.</v>

1586
00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:46.830
<v Speaker 4>And then another thing that Joey does that I just love and I always look for is</v>

1587
00:44:46.831 --> 00:44:49.710
<v Speaker 4>that he kills faster than anybody else too.</v>

1588
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:53.430
<v Speaker 4>Like for some reason the audience immediately can tell he's just being himself</v>

1589
00:44:53.431 --> 00:44:54.300
<v Speaker 4>an artist or renal.</v>

1590
00:44:54.301 --> 00:44:55.470
<v Speaker 4>When he walks up there and goes,</v>

1591
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:56.011
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1592
00:44:56.011 --> 00:44:57.620
<v Speaker 4>cock suckers [inaudible] bar,</v>

1593
00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.190
<v Speaker 4>and it's already happening.</v>

1594
00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.180
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1595
00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.980
<v Speaker 4>They connect with them immediately.</v>

1596
00:45:01.981 --> 00:45:02.731
<v Speaker 4>There's none of that.</v>

1597
00:45:02.731 --> 00:45:02.941
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1598

<v Speaker 1>he's just everything about him.</v>

1613

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:35.910
<v Speaker 1>just laughing and telling Brad Williams is back there laughing and talking and</v>

1676
00:46:35.911 --> 00:46:40.530

1677
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.810
<v Speaker 1>It just gets you so fired up to do comedy.</v>

1678
00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I went on that stage last night running,</v>

1679
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:45.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1680
00:46:45.781 --> 00:46:47.290
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't wait to get up there.</v>

1681
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:48.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like there was so much shit.</v>

1682
00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:50.850
<v Speaker 1>It was all in the air in that place.</v>

1683
00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1684
00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:51.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

1685
00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.460
<v Speaker 1>that's something that I forgot about man.</v>

1686
00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:54.323
<v Speaker 1>I really did.</v>

1687
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about it when I left the store cause I was so angry at the</v>

1688
00:46:56.821 --> 00:46:58.110
<v Speaker 1>circumstances and everything.</v>

1689
00:46:58.290 --> 00:46:59.940
<v Speaker 1>But I think even so,</v>

1690
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:02.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it got better while we were gone.</v>

1691
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:06.870
<v Speaker 1>People were saying that it got better around the time of podcasting for some</v>

1692
00:47:06.871 --> 00:47:11.871
<v Speaker 1>reason that they sort of coincided that it was like about five years ago the</v>

1693
00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:13.590
<v Speaker 1>store really started picking up,</v>

1694
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.540
<v Speaker 1>which is about when like,</v>

1695
00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:16.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1696
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:18.800
<v Speaker 1>this isn't that like how long Adam Carolla has been doing podcasts?</v>

1697
00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:19.560
<v Speaker 1>Most,</v>

1698
00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.330
<v Speaker 1>most comics about five years ago.</v>

1699
00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1700
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.000
<v Speaker 1>And I think that a lot of comics,</v>

1701
00:47:24.001 --> 00:47:26.460
<v Speaker 1>when they started doing podcasts and the Corolla showing other people's</v>

1702
00:47:26.461 --> 00:47:27.000
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>

1703
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 1>people started hearing about comedy and then realizing that a lot of these</v>

1704
00:47:30.161 --> 00:47:31.180
<v Speaker 1>people that are comics,</v>

1705
00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:33.940
<v Speaker 1>they're just fucking regular people that just decided to do comedy.</v>

1706
00:47:33.941 --> 00:47:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Like how many people have you met in your life when you're like,</v>

1707
00:47:36.281 --> 00:47:36.970
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1710
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:40.480

1711
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.740

1714
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:44.830
<v Speaker 1>So your cert more cynical in me.</v>

1715
00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.860
<v Speaker 1>There's some chick that was hanging out at the bar the other night.</v>

1716
00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:47.890

<v Speaker 1>She was really funny.</v>

1720
00:47:51.521 --> 00:47:51.761
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1721
00:47:51.761 --> 00:47:52.361
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

1722
00:47:52.361 --> 00:47:52.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1723
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:52.960
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

1724
00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:53.950
<v Speaker 1>which works in banking.</v>

1725
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:54.401
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1726
00:47:54.401 --> 00:47:55.420
<v Speaker 1>you should be a comedian.</v>

1727
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:56.830
<v Speaker 1>You're really fucking funny.</v>

1728
00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:57.791
<v Speaker 1>And she's got this,</v>

1729
00:47:57.791 --> 00:48:01.000
<v Speaker 1>got this natural sense of delivery and personality.</v>

1730
00:48:01.001 --> 00:48:01.271
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1731
00:48:01.271 --> 00:48:02.170
<v Speaker 1>you really should do it.</v>

1732
00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Just go to an open mic night.</v>

1733
00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Just go and watch how bad everybody sucks.</v>

1734
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:10.270
<v Speaker 1>You'll want to do it cause like open mic nights are the craziest places ever it,</v>

1735
00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:10.810
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1736
00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:15.780
<v Speaker 1>If you want to find the epicenter of Cuckoo in Hollywood or hacks or some hacks</v>

1737
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:16.623
<v Speaker 1>at open mics.</v>

1738
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.780
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1739
00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:17.613
<v Speaker 8>they're hackers.</v>

1740
00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:18.830
<v Speaker 8>Mostly actors.</v>

1741
00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.000
<v Speaker 8>That's a good expression.</v>

1742
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.721
<v Speaker 8>I hate that though.</v>

1743
00:48:23.721 --> 00:48:24.531
<v Speaker 8>You see that a lot,</v>

1744
00:48:24.531 --> 00:48:25.580
<v Speaker 8>especially on killed Tony.</v>

1745
00:48:25.581 --> 00:48:28.850
<v Speaker 8>These guys that don't really want to be comics,</v>

1746
00:48:28.851 --> 00:48:31.580
<v Speaker 8>but they're doing it because they want to be come an actor.</v>

1747
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:33.530
<v Speaker 8>So they kind of go through that route.</v>

1748
00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:34.790
<v Speaker 8>It really,</v>

1749
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:35.750
<v Speaker 8>it's really noticeable.</v>

1750
00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1751
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Or they want to brag to their improv troupe that they went and did stand up at</v>

1752
00:48:40.271 --> 00:48:42.430
<v Speaker 1>the comedy store and then they tell you I'm a comic.</v>

1753
00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:43.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1754
00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Well not only can they do,</v>

1755
00:48:44.441 --> 00:48:44.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud,</v>

1756
00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:46.140
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also a comedian.</v>

1757
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:46.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1758
00:48:46.331 --> 00:48:47.200
<v Speaker 1>That would be like your,</v>

1759
00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.180
<v Speaker 1>your headshot standup comedian.</v>

1760
00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:49.631
<v Speaker 1>Actor,</v>

1761
00:48:49.631 --> 00:48:52.180
<v Speaker 1>first actor slash standup comedian.</v>

1762
00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1763
00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.200
<v Speaker 1>There's some about actors that like,</v>

1764
00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:01.570
<v Speaker 1>it's really difficult to get somebody to pick you for stuff.</v>

1765
00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Like it's the worst part about being an actor.</v>

1766
00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Like I know people that are actors that are like really struggling and they,</v>

1767
00:49:07.301 --> 00:49:07.660
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1768
00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:12.040
<v Speaker 1>it's an insanely frustrating because it's not something you can just do.</v>

1769
00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:12.611
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1770
00:49:12.611 --> 00:49:12.791
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1771
00:49:12.791 --> 00:49:13.750
<v Speaker 1>if you do stand up,</v>

1772
00:49:13.751 --> 00:49:14.531
<v Speaker 1>there's an open Mike night,</v>

1773
00:49:14.531 --> 00:49:14.831
<v Speaker 1>you go up,</v>

1774
00:49:14.831 --> 00:49:16.090
<v Speaker 1>you fucking kill and you,</v>

1775
00:49:16.091 --> 00:49:17.290
<v Speaker 1>if you just keep doing that,</v>

1776
00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:20.740
<v Speaker 1>eventually somehow or another you just get better and you become a professional.</v>

1777
00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:21.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really the,</v>

1778
00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:23.020
<v Speaker 1>the college of standup comedy.</v>

1779
00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.070
<v Speaker 1>But for an actor,</v>

1780
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:25.900
<v Speaker 1>you've got to have somebody find you.</v>

1781
00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:27.220
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have somebody fine,</v>

1782
00:49:27.221 --> 00:49:27.441
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1783
00:49:27.441 --> 00:49:28.390
<v Speaker 1>they've got to come get you.</v>

1784
00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.471
<v Speaker 1>They got to see you.</v>

1785
00:49:29.471 --> 00:49:30.370
<v Speaker 1>You do the audition,</v>

1786
00:49:30.371 --> 00:49:31.204
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

1787
00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.501
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

1788
00:49:32.501 --> 00:49:34.620
<v Speaker 1>let's make him the guy and they take in,</v>

1789
00:49:34.621 --> 00:49:37.240
<v Speaker 1>they fucking put makeup on you and they push in front of the camera,</v>

1790
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.730
<v Speaker 1>give you a bunch of shit to say and they picked you.</v>

1791
00:49:39.731 --> 00:49:40.600
<v Speaker 1>But guess what?</v>

1792
00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:41.500
<v Speaker 1>He could have done it.</v>

1793
00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:42.400
<v Speaker 1>He could have done it.</v>

1794
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.233
<v Speaker 1>He could have done it.</v>

1795
00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.020
<v Speaker 1>He could have done it.</v>

1796
00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:44.980
<v Speaker 1>They could change the gender.</v>

1797
00:49:44.981 --> 00:49:45.814
<v Speaker 1>She could have done it.</v>

1798
00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like there's so many people for each role.</v>

1799
00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:49.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1800
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a few really good ones.</v>

1801
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:51.850
<v Speaker 1>There's a few,</v>

1802
00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:52.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1803
00:49:52.331 --> 00:49:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Marlon Brando type characters that rise through the rest.</v>

1804
00:49:55.931 --> 00:49:58.360
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is you've got to get picked.</v>

1805
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:01.150
<v Speaker 1>And so this is weird social game that's going on.</v>

1806
00:50:01.151 --> 00:50:01.630
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>

1807
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:04.690
<v Speaker 1>they're all socially like terrified.</v>

1808
00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:06.880
<v Speaker 1>They're afraid and not all of them,</v>

1809
00:50:06.881 --> 00:50:07.511
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of them,</v>

1810
00:50:07.511 --> 00:50:09.310
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid to truly speak their mind.</v>

1811
00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:13.180
<v Speaker 1>They're always like in this weird like confi they're always like hoping that you</v>

1812
00:50:13.181 --> 00:50:17.200
<v Speaker 1>liked them because they have the audition all the time and these powerful people</v>

1813
00:50:17.201 --> 00:50:18.280
<v Speaker 1>standing in front of them and go,</v>

1814
00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:19.181
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

1815
00:50:19.181 --> 00:50:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1816
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1817
00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.890
<v Speaker 1>Like Dom Irrera was telling me about an audition then he went on and how</v>

1818
00:50:23.891 --> 00:50:24.551
<v Speaker 1>insulting it was.</v>

1819
00:50:24.551 --> 00:50:27.950
<v Speaker 1>The woman's started eating her sandwich and checking her texts while he was</v>

1820
00:50:27.951 --> 00:50:28.191
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

1821
00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:31.730
<v Speaker 1>as long as she's eating a sandwich and checking your texts,</v>

1822
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.660
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1823
00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1824
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:34.550
<v Speaker 1>that's dark.</v>

1825
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1826
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1827
00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:36.410
<v Speaker 1>That's rough.</v>

1828
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:36.700
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

1829
00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 1>if that's how you make your living and you keep going to these things and some</v>

1830
00:50:40.581 --> 00:50:43.070
<v Speaker 1>woman's they're eating or sandwich or some guy is a,</v>

1831
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.370
<v Speaker 1>he's a in the middle of a text message while he's listening to you.</v>

1832
00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:47.571
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

1833
00:50:47.571 --> 00:50:48.404
<v Speaker 1>Thanks Tony.</v>

1834
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:49.620
<v Speaker 1>That was very good time.</v>

1835
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:51.230
<v Speaker 1>We'll be in touch and you're like,</v>

1836
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:51.651
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1837
00:50:51.651 --> 00:50:52.484
<v Speaker 1>I'll never eat.</v>

1838
00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:54.470
<v Speaker 1>You mean that's fucked.</v>

1839
00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:55.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1840
00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:57.320
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes like commercial auditions,</v>

1841
00:50:57.321 --> 00:50:59.540
<v Speaker 3>they'll just want like a reaction and then people are like,</v>

1842
00:50:59.541 --> 00:50:59.690
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1843
00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:00.320
<v Speaker 3>how was it?</v>

1844
00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:00.531
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1845
00:51:00.531 --> 00:51:00.961
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1846
00:51:00.961 --> 00:51:02.000
<v Speaker 3>I just like smile,</v>

1847
00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:03.020
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know how I did.</v>

1848
00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:03.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1849
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:04.150
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1850
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:05.470
<v Speaker 4>Commercial auditions for the worst.</v>

1851
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:06.880
<v Speaker 4>When I first started,</v>

1852
00:51:06.881 --> 00:51:11.881
<v Speaker 4>I got sent on a lot of those and the assistant for the agent that I had was like</v>

1853
00:51:12.131 --> 00:51:12.791
<v Speaker 4>the worst.</v>

1854
00:51:12.791 --> 00:51:16.240
<v Speaker 4>He was notoriously bad at what he did because there were a few guys signed with</v>

1855
00:51:16.241 --> 00:51:17.770
<v Speaker 4>this agency at the store,</v>

1856
00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:21.490
<v Speaker 4>so he would just be hung over from a crazy night before.</v>

1857
00:51:21.491 --> 00:51:24.280
<v Speaker 4>And he would send you out on a bad audition,</v>

1858
00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:26.200
<v Speaker 4>like one that you're not even matched for,</v>

1859
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:28.450
<v Speaker 4>who says we have an audition for you today at,</v>

1860
00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1861
00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:31.070

1878
00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:54.241
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1879
00:51:54.241 --> 00:51:54.970
<v Speaker 6>I ain't never had that.</v>

1880
00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:55.501
<v Speaker 6>When you do that,</v>

1881
00:51:55.501 --> 00:51:57.360
<v Speaker 6>would you play a 50 year old Asian woman?</v>

1882
00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:58.060
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1883
00:51:58.060 --> 00:51:58.770
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1884
00:51:58.770 --> 00:51:59.603
<v Speaker 6>I would just read it</v>

1885
00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:03.120
<v Speaker 6>so tired.</v>

1886
00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:11.970
<v Speaker 1>I started acting like on,</v>

1887
00:52:11.971 --> 00:52:12.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1888
00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:13.560
<v Speaker 1>when I was living in New York,</v>

1889
00:52:13.561 --> 00:52:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I started going on audition so it didn't do any acting,</v>

1890
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:18.780
<v Speaker 1>but I got this agent and then all of a sudden they'd go,</v>

1891
00:52:18.781 --> 00:52:19.614
<v Speaker 1>do you want to act?</v>

1892
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:20.120
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1893
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.330
<v Speaker 1>and it was really one of those like,</v>

1894
00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.080
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1895
00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:22.611
<v Speaker 1>And then also,</v>

1896
00:52:22.611 --> 00:52:23.610
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going out on auditions,</v>

1897
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:25.320
<v Speaker 1>zero acting experience,</v>

1898
00:52:25.321 --> 00:52:25.801
<v Speaker 1>none.</v>

1899
00:52:25.801 --> 00:52:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1900
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:26.551
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1901
00:52:26.551 --> 00:52:27.450
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing?</v>

1902
00:52:27.451 --> 00:52:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Like what is this?</v>

1903
00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:32.250
<v Speaker 1>And it was the first time I ever got to see child stars because I didn't know</v>

1904
00:52:32.251 --> 00:52:32.940
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

1905
00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea that there was these like stage moms in the stage,</v>

1906
00:52:36.061 --> 00:52:37.020
<v Speaker 1>moms with their kids,</v>

1907
00:52:37.021 --> 00:52:39.030
<v Speaker 1>especially for like a commercial auditions.</v>

1908
00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys run into them in la?</v>

1909
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:41.380
<v Speaker 3>I'd sage moms.</v>

1910
00:52:41.381 --> 00:52:42.070
<v Speaker 3>I've seen some,</v>

1911
00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:42.580
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1912
00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:43.060
<v Speaker 3>I have it.</v>

1913
00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:43.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1914
00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.100
<v Speaker 3>they're the scariest,</v>

1915
00:52:45.101 --> 00:52:45.881
<v Speaker 3>and I grew up here,</v>

1916
00:52:45.881 --> 00:52:50.020
<v Speaker 3>so I saw a lot of stage moms when I was like little like in school there's like</v>

1917
00:52:50.021 --> 00:52:53.230
<v Speaker 3>act or kids with their stage moms and my mom was afraid of them,</v>

1918
00:52:53.231 --> 00:52:54.064
<v Speaker 3>so now I'm just,</v>

1919
00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.270
<v Speaker 3>I've always avoided,</v>

1920
00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:59.800
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen a mom out of a commercial audition who said to her,</v>

1921
00:52:59.801 --> 00:53:00.550
<v Speaker 3>kid,</v>

1922
00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:02.980
<v Speaker 3>sit down or I'm going to beat the Jesus out to you.</v>

1923
00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.990
<v Speaker 3>Like in the commercial audition,</v>

1924
00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:05.860
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1925
00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:06.693
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1926
00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:07.220
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1927
00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:07.771
<v Speaker 6>Jesus.</v>

1928
00:53:07.771 --> 00:53:08.604
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1929
00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:10.523
<v Speaker 6>expressions.</v>

1930
00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:11.471
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1931
00:53:11.471 --> 00:53:11.810
<v Speaker 6>Wah,</v>

1932
00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:14.110
<v Speaker 6>hit my kid but I'm not going to blast him the Lord.</v>

1933
00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:15.840
<v Speaker 6>It's the budget,</v>

1934
00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.040
<v Speaker 6>but I don't say the real Jesus.</v>

1935
00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:21.370
<v Speaker 6>Jesus is the fake cheese from the creator of the name.</v>

1936
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:25.180
<v Speaker 6>The word licorice whips comes beejesus licorice.</v>

1937
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 6>It seems like the</v>

1938
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.180
<v Speaker 1>same guy who made that word probably made up beejesus licorice whips be Jesus.</v>

1939
00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe bell licorice whips.</v>

1940
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Real licorice.</v>

1941
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Black people.</v>

1942
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.330
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

1943
00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:40.770
<v Speaker 1>But Jesus,</v>

1944
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:41.693
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1945
00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:43.590
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like something that Taryn,</v>

1946
00:53:43.591 --> 00:53:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Tina would say while promoting on the beach,</v>

1947
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I cannot figure it out.</v>

1948
00:53:50.041 --> 00:53:50.874
<v Speaker 1>My computer.</v>

1949
00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:55.080
<v Speaker 1>I just always felt like the culture of a auditioning was always like insanely</v>

1950
00:53:55.081 --> 00:53:57.450
<v Speaker 1>like defeating and get felt bad.</v>

1951
00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1952
00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:01.500
<v Speaker 1>and I used to think that like that's the reason why I think a lot of people are</v>

1953
00:54:01.501 --> 00:54:02.820
<v Speaker 1>depressed in Hollywood.</v>

1954
00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Like especially actors.</v>

1955
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Like when I started going on auditions,</v>

1956
00:54:07.021 --> 00:54:10.050
<v Speaker 1>I f I failed miserably and all these movie auditions,</v>

1957
00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:10.890
<v Speaker 1>I went on it because they'll,</v>

1958
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:13.440
<v Speaker 1>your agency will send you out for shit that like,</v>

1959
00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:16.320
<v Speaker 1>like say if they already have some movie star for a role,</v>

1960
00:54:16.321 --> 00:54:17.520
<v Speaker 1>they already have it cast.</v>

1961
00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:21.000
<v Speaker 1>They'll still take like 30 people and they'll say,</v>

1962
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.750
<v Speaker 1>well you should,</v>

1963
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:24.810
<v Speaker 1>you should go so they can see you because they might like it for something else.</v>

1964
00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:25.231
<v Speaker 1>And I'd be like,</v>

1965
00:54:25.231 --> 00:54:26.064
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1966
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Like in my mind I was like,</v>

1967
00:54:27.451 --> 00:54:28.460
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't even make any sense.</v>

1968
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want me to act?</v>

1969
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:33.630
<v Speaker 1>So you want me to learn some lines and go and make a relationship with a casting</v>

1970
00:54:33.631 --> 00:54:34.000
<v Speaker 1>director.</v>

1971
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:34.341
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1972
00:54:34.341 --> 00:54:35.041
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1973
00:54:35.041 --> 00:54:35.791
<v Speaker 1>I guess I get it,</v>

1974
00:54:35.791 --> 00:54:37.140
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't get it at all.</v>

1975
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:41.010
<v Speaker 1>So I would go there and I would always feel bad after I leave.</v>

1976
00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:41.431
<v Speaker 1>I be like,</v>

1977
00:54:41.431 --> 00:54:42.360
<v Speaker 1>this is just,</v>

1978
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:43.763
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

1979
00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:45.600
<v Speaker 1>one time I went to this audition,</v>

1980
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:47.610
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the most embarrassing moments ever.</v>

1981
00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I went into his audition and this lady was reading the audition and she was</v>

1982
00:54:52.621 --> 00:54:55.080
<v Speaker 1>asking me where I was from and I said that,</v>

1983
00:54:55.081 --> 00:54:55.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1984
00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:56.213
<v Speaker 1>I'm from,</v>

1985
00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1986
00:54:57.010 --> 00:54:58.410
<v Speaker 1>just moved from New York.</v>

1987
00:54:58.800 --> 00:54:59.191
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1988
00:54:59.191 --> 00:54:59.371
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1989
00:54:59.371 --> 00:54:59.581
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1990
00:54:59.581 --> 00:55:00.031
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1991
00:55:00.031 --> 00:55:00.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1992
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:02.130
<v Speaker 1>born in New Jersey and she said,</v>

1993
00:55:02.131 --> 00:55:03.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm born in New Jersey too,</v>

1994
00:55:03.241 --> 00:55:04.260
<v Speaker 1>but I don't tell anybody that.</v>

1995
00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:05.460
<v Speaker 1>I tell them I'm from New York.</v>

1996
00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:06.541
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1997
00:55:06.541 --> 00:55:07.170
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1998
00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you just tell them that you're from New Jersey?</v>

1999
00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:10.501
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

2000
00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:10.860
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

2001
00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:11.131
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2002
00:55:11.131 --> 00:55:12.720
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to be from New Jersey.</v>

2003
00:55:12.721 --> 00:55:15.000
<v Speaker 1>So I just tell them I'm from New York and I go,</v>

2004
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.440

00:59:17.111 --> 00:59:17.990
<v Speaker 5>1818.</v>

2150
00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:18.540
<v Speaker 5>That was it.</v>

2151
00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:19.120
<v Speaker 5>That was it.</v>

2152
00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.350
<v Speaker 5>That's what makes an eight team.</v>

2153
00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:21.561
<v Speaker 5>Sarah,</v>

2154
00:59:21.561 --> 00:59:23.030
<v Speaker 5>how old are you mentally?</v>

2155
00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:23.600
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2156
00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.440
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2157
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:25.881
<v Speaker 5>it depends.</v>

2158
00:59:25.881 --> 00:59:28.220
<v Speaker 5>Either I'm like 65 or 12.</v>

2159
00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:29.721
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2160
00:59:29.721 --> 00:59:30.554
<v Speaker 5>that's a good answer.</v>

2161
00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:31.100
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

2162
00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:31.370
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2163
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:32.121
<v Speaker 5>so when you're tired,</v>

2164
00:59:32.121 --> 00:59:32.954
<v Speaker 5>you're 65.</v>

2165
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2166
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:36.050
<v Speaker 5>Or having a good time or 12 or 12 like,</v>

2167
00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:38.800
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2168
00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:43.880
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I'm like just my age mentally.</v>

2169
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:44.743
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2170
00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:46.010
<v Speaker 5>In the moment chick.</v>

2171
00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:51.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm 109 how'd that happen?</v>

2172
00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:54.230
<v Speaker 5>It's paid too much attention to shit,</v>

2173
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:55.610
<v Speaker 5>dude here I think so.</v>

2174
00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:56.870
<v Speaker 5>You've taken too many variables.</v>

2175
00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:58.640
<v Speaker 5>I probably do.</v>

2176
00:59:58.790 --> 00:59:59.623
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2177
00:59:59.630 --> 01:00:00.470
<v Speaker 5>Well you're a,</v>

2178
01:00:00.471 --> 01:00:01.340
<v Speaker 5>you're a bit obsessed.</v>

2179
01:00:01.341 --> 01:00:03.740
<v Speaker 5>Tony Hinchcliffe could a bit obsessed with the standup comedy</v>

2180
01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.170
<v Speaker 4>with everything today.</v>

2181
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:07.230
<v Speaker 4>I thought I was dying in the shower for sure.</v>

2182
01:00:07.231 --> 01:00:10.710
<v Speaker 4>I was 100% positive that I was having an appendix attack.</v>

2183
01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.720
<v Speaker 4>Like something like right in my,</v>

2184
01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:14.040
<v Speaker 4>in my upper,</v>

2185
01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:15.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean lower belly and I'm just like,</v>

2186
01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:17.190
<v Speaker 4>this is that this is,</v>

2187
01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:21.920
<v Speaker 4>I can convince myself that the worst shit is happening and then what to,</v>

2188
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.380
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2189
01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've been on the road with him and it's happened a few times.</v>

2190
01:00:24.931 --> 01:00:25.120
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2191
01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.880
<v Speaker 4>So you're essentially a hypochondriac.</v>

2192
01:00:26.881 --> 01:00:27.714
<v Speaker 4>Does that what it is?</v>

2193
01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:30.090
<v Speaker 4>It's more of a panic attack type of thing,</v>

2194
01:00:30.091 --> 01:00:32.820
<v Speaker 4>but it's like not like what you think a panic.</v>

2195
01:00:32.821 --> 01:00:34.830
<v Speaker 4>It's just all inside the head.</v>

2196
01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:35.370
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

2197
01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:36.000
<v Speaker 4>And anyway,</v>

2198
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.790
<v Speaker 4>ended up fighting and then the appendix attack was gone that fast.</v>

2199
01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.660
<v Speaker 4>It was just one little fourth second tutor.</v>

2200
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:42.120
<v Speaker 4>Rooney.</v>

2201
01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.130
<v Speaker 4>I have had that happen.</v>

2202
01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:45.930
<v Speaker 5>I've had that happen before.</v>

2203
01:00:45.931 --> 01:00:47.460
<v Speaker 5>You get a weird stomach pain,</v>

2204
01:00:47.461 --> 01:00:47.701
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

2205
01:00:47.701 --> 01:00:50.190
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is that like that's new.</v>

2206
01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.171
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2207
01:00:51.171 --> 01:00:52.240
<v Speaker 4>And when it's new,</v>

2208
01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:53.510
<v Speaker 4>immediately my Amy,</v>

2209
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you guys got to be the same where it's like I've never felt that</v>

2210
01:00:56.931 --> 01:00:57.680
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

2211
01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.560
<v Speaker 4>And that's gotta be something</v>

2212
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:04.060
<v Speaker 5>or just farts or what were you eating all that Vegan food do?</v>

2213
01:01:04.061 --> 01:01:04.681
<v Speaker 5>That's a problem.</v>

2214
01:01:04.681 --> 01:01:07.500
<v Speaker 5>It always ends up being a fart by the way was my problems.</v>

2215
01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:09.930
<v Speaker 5>Broccoli shit gets impacted.</v>

2216
01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:10.810
<v Speaker 5>I had,</v>

2217
01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:14.130
<v Speaker 5>I need to put a hole in my stomach's that people can pull out the grains.</v>

2218
01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.570
<v Speaker 5>Too many grains.</v>

2219
01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:18.750
<v Speaker 5>I think that's essentially like diverticulitis probably in a lot of ways.</v>

2220
01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:19.940
<v Speaker 5>That's what happens to a,</v>

2221
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:21.240
<v Speaker 5>that's what happened at Brock Lesnar.</v>

2222
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2223
01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:22.590
<v Speaker 5>It happened to a few people.</v>

2224
01:01:22.591 --> 01:01:24.040
<v Speaker 5>I know they had to get uh,</v>

2225
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:25.590
<v Speaker 5>parts of their colon removed.</v>

2226
01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:26.191
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2227
01:01:26.191 --> 01:01:26.800
<v Speaker 5>One guy know,</v>

2228
01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.470
<v Speaker 5>caught it before it got too bad,</v>

2229
01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.360
<v Speaker 5>but you just get impacted.</v>

2230
01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:31.111
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2231
01:01:31.111 --> 01:01:34.170
<v Speaker 5>Anthony Bordain was telling me that it can be anything he said he could like be</v>

2232
01:01:34.171 --> 01:01:36.570
<v Speaker 5>like a pumpkin seed or something gets stuck in there.</v>

2233
01:01:36.571 --> 01:01:37.490
<v Speaker 5>Like he eats something,</v>

2234
01:01:37.491 --> 01:01:39.350
<v Speaker 5>gets stuck and then it creates an abscess.</v>

2235
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:39.930
<v Speaker 5>Is like,</v>

2236
01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:41.710
<v Speaker 5>it's not just meet like with Brock Lesnar,</v>

2237
01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:42.541
<v Speaker 5>supposedly it was just,</v>

2238
01:01:42.541 --> 01:01:43.520
<v Speaker 5>he all he ate was meat.</v>

2239
01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:47.790
<v Speaker 5>Like it wasn't eating any fiber and his bowels get all fucked up because of it.</v>

2240
01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:48.301
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2241
01:01:48.301 --> 01:01:49.060
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

2242
01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:49.590
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

2243
01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:50.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2244
01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:50.820
<v Speaker 5>You got to eat.</v>

2245
01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.380
<v Speaker 5>Like you have to eat healthy,</v>

2246
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.851
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2247
01:01:53.851 --> 01:01:55.590
<v Speaker 5>like fiber's important for your body.</v>

2248
01:01:55.591 --> 01:01:56.250
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

2249
01:01:56.250 --> 01:01:57.570
<v Speaker 5>it's not just a luxury,</v>

2250
01:01:57.571 --> 01:01:58.500
<v Speaker 5>it's a necessity.</v>

2251
01:01:58.501 --> 01:02:00.210
<v Speaker 5>Like if you want this thing to work right,</v>

2252
01:02:00.211 --> 01:02:01.044
<v Speaker 5>you gotta eat lettuce,</v>

2253
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:02.490
<v Speaker 5>it's got a push everything out.</v>

2254
01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:03.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2255
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:03.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2256
01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:04.093
<v Speaker 5>And when you don't,</v>

2257
01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:04.771
<v Speaker 5>it can really,</v>

2258
01:02:04.771 --> 01:02:07.290
<v Speaker 5>and then there's some people that get it to just have a propensity for it</v>

2259
01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:08.100
<v Speaker 5>apparently.</v>

2260
01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:08.700
<v Speaker 5>But when they,</v>

2261
01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:12.480
<v Speaker 5>when they have to remove like sections of your intestines and Shit,</v>

2262
01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:14.493
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>

2263
01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:18.290
<v Speaker 4>clean my bedroom the other day and I have a pretty big bed.</v>

2264
01:02:18.291 --> 01:02:19.650
<v Speaker 4>But underneath bed</v>

2265
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.180
<v Speaker 8>it's like in the middle,</v>

2266
01:02:21.181 --> 01:02:22.860
<v Speaker 8>you never can get anything on,</v>

2267
01:02:22.861 --> 01:02:23.071
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2268
01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:24.640
<v Speaker 8>like if something falls under the bed.</v>

2269
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:29.160
<v Speaker 8>So I was trying to get everything and I pulled out a single cheeseburger from</v>

2270
01:02:29.161 --> 01:02:33.090
<v Speaker 8>Mcdonald's that I guess I was eating and I threw,</v>

2271
01:02:33.091 --> 01:02:34.380
<v Speaker 8>I threw it on the ground or something.</v>

2272
01:02:34.381 --> 01:02:36.750
<v Speaker 8>And it just went in there and get like to you,</v>

2273
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:37.560
<v Speaker 8>I know budget,</v>

2274
01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.400
<v Speaker 8>how can you live?</v>

2275
01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:43.780
<v Speaker 8>Like I haven't had mcdonalds in my bed for at least six months and so that,</v>

2276
01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:45.240
<v Speaker 8>but when I opened it,</v>

2277
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.380
<v Speaker 8>it looked brand new.</v>

2278
01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:48.120
<v Speaker 8>It looked just exactly the same.</v>

2279
01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:52.420
<v Speaker 8>You would buy that perfect apartments like the raft of a survivor stranded at</v>

2280
01:02:52.421 --> 01:02:53.220
<v Speaker 8>sea.</v>

2281
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:58.220
<v Speaker 8>It's just scattered disarray with bobbers and nets and one shoe</v>

2282
01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:01.650
<v Speaker 8>pirate in the corner for some reason.</v>

2283
01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:02.821
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2284
01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:07.140
<v Speaker 5>that big area in the middle we can't reach under your bed area is a problem.</v>

2285
01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:07.921
<v Speaker 5>It's disgusting it.</v>

2286
01:03:07.921 --> 01:03:09.060
<v Speaker 5>Cause if you ever do move,</v>

2287
01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:09.960
<v Speaker 5>you bed your bed,</v>

2288
01:03:09.961 --> 01:03:11.140
<v Speaker 5>you're like looking at it going,</v>

2289
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:12.150
<v Speaker 5>that's so gross.</v>

2290
01:03:12.151 --> 01:03:14.220

2291
01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:16.830
<v Speaker 5>The center area we can't reach.</v>

2292
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.840

<v Speaker 8>I licked the stripper pole.</v>

2302
01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.360
<v Speaker 8>I licked the stripper pole at a crazy girl as a couple of months ago on stage.</v>

2303
01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:42.430
<v Speaker 8>We were doing comedy there.</v>

2304
01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:43.090
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

2305
01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:47.500
<v Speaker 8>and I just said some hot girl just got off and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 8>Everyone was like,</v>

2310
01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:55.570
<v Speaker 8>but then I thought about it and then I had like a canker on my time for like</v>

2311
01:03:55.571 --> 01:03:56.404
<v Speaker 8>three days.</v>

2315
01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:06.700
<v Speaker 8>That is so hilarious.</v>

2316
01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:09.670
<v Speaker 8>David Arquette owns that place now and I told him like he would,</v>

2317
01:04:09.671 --> 01:04:12.790
<v Speaker 8>he did kill Tony and I told him about that and you just give me a high five.</v>

2327
01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:35.470
<v Speaker 8>Cause they have like a strobe light facing the comic.</v>

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:55.750
<v Speaker 5>Nice.</v>

2376
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.891
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2377
01:05:55.891 --> 01:05:56.724
<v Speaker 5>it's really neat.</v>

2378
01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:57.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2379
01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:01.510
<v Speaker 5>And he's doing one of those like Thunderpussy style shows that people yell out</v>

2380
01:06:01.511 --> 01:06:03.550
<v Speaker 5>topics and you discussed them.</v>

2381
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:04.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2382
01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.133
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>

2383
01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.113
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2385
01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:07.510
<v Speaker 5>Should be fun.</v>

2386
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.631
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2387
01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:08.081
<v Speaker 5>fund your post.</v>

2388
01:06:08.081 --> 01:06:09.400
<v Speaker 5>He's a really fun show to do it too.</v>

2389
01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:11.380
<v Speaker 5>And if you have the right crowd and it's right.</v>

2390
01:06:11.381 --> 01:06:11.891
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2391
01:06:11.891 --> 01:06:12.820
<v Speaker 5>And this show,</v>

2392
01:06:12.821 --> 01:06:14.110
<v Speaker 5>because it's in Hollywood,</v>

2393
01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:18.730
<v Speaker 5>so the audience is a little more open than a Pasadena crowd who's a little bit</v>

2394
01:06:18.731 --> 01:06:19.481
<v Speaker 5>more outside.</v>

2395
01:06:19.481 --> 01:06:22.720
<v Speaker 5>So the crowds are always a little bit better for this than for,</v>

2396
01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:23.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2397
01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:24.400
<v Speaker 5>the passenger,</v>

2398
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:24.641
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2399
01:06:24.641 --> 01:06:25.480
<v Speaker 5>not good.</v>

2400
01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:26.890
<v Speaker 5>They're not necessarily a better crowd.</v>

2401
01:06:26.891 --> 01:06:29.260
<v Speaker 5>There were more interactive crowd to give you the topics that you need,</v>

2402
01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:29.860
<v Speaker 5>like a better,</v>

2403
01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:31.340
<v Speaker 5>like a better group of suggestion.</v>

2404
01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:31.690
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

2405
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:32.231
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

2406
01:06:32.231 --> 01:06:34.330
<v Speaker 5>A little bit wide open with suggestions.</v>

2407
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:35.051
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2408
01:06:35.051 --> 01:06:37.150
<v Speaker 5>You can't get a better crowd than the ice house.</v>

2409
01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:39.460
<v Speaker 5>Literally don't think it's possible.</v>

2410
01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:40.270
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2411
01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:41.260
<v Speaker 5>What only was possible.</v>

2412

2419
01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.130

2439
01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:26.230
<v Speaker 5>like doing a set.</v>

2440
01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.120
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't seem like you're doing a special at all.</v>

2441
01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:31.180
<v Speaker 5>I like sometimes you've seen people do specials and they look like a little more</v>

2442
01:07:31.181 --> 01:07:33.400
<v Speaker 5>tense than they do when they're,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 9>MMM,</v>

2489
01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:40.050
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

2490
01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:40.380
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2491
01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:42.510
<v Speaker 4>I got a job working at the comedy store,</v>

2492
01:08:42.570 --> 01:08:44.880
<v Speaker 4>so I went solo just with that.</v>

2493
01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:45.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2494
01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.193
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

2495
01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:46.650
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2496
01:08:46.650 --> 01:08:47.483
<v Speaker 4>for</v>

2497
01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:49.800
<v Speaker 4>four years.</v>

2498
01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.690
<v Speaker 4>Just made enough money to get by working there.</v>

2499
01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:56.830
<v Speaker 4>He at just just barely enough money to get by because back then wasn't the same</v>

2500
01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:59.670
<v Speaker 4>exact regime of managers.</v>

2501
01:08:59.730 --> 01:09:00.001
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2502
01:09:00.001 --> 01:09:03.540
<v Speaker 4>And what was happening before where they were notorious for um,</v>

2503
01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:06.600
<v Speaker 4>for shaving hours that you'd actually work.</v>

2504
01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:11.370
<v Speaker 4>And back then there were also was literally one fifth as many employees as there</v>

2505
01:09:11.371 --> 01:09:11.761
<v Speaker 4>is now.</v>

2506
01:09:11.761 --> 01:09:16.260
<v Speaker 4>So I was one of like five guys that was working phones during the day and then</v>

2507
01:09:16.261 --> 01:09:17.640
<v Speaker 4>working the door at night.</v>

2508
01:09:17.850 --> 01:09:19.320
<v Speaker 4>So I was struggling.</v>

2509
01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:20.280
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2510
01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.340
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't even getting what I was working.</v>

2511
01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.700
<v Speaker 5>Those stories are so cool though.</v>

2512
01:09:23.730 --> 01:09:25.290
<v Speaker 5>When someone goes from being a doorman,</v>

2513
01:09:25.291 --> 01:09:29.400
<v Speaker 5>like Ari goes from being a doorman at the comedy store doing his comedy central</v>

2514
01:09:29.401 --> 01:09:31.140
<v Speaker 5>special at the comedy store.</v>

2515
01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.400
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] you know,</v>

2516
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:34.070
<v Speaker 5>and then the name of it he liked,</v>

2517
01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.760
<v Speaker 5>he made it paid regular.</v>

2518
01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:36.683
<v Speaker 5>That was the name.</v>

2519
01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:38.280
<v Speaker 5>Cause like that was always the thing.</v>

2520
01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:39.740
<v Speaker 5>Like he wanted to become a paid regular.</v>

2521
01:09:39.741 --> 01:09:42.390
<v Speaker 5>Do you worked at it for like four and a half years before she finally got him in</v>

2522
01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:43.643
<v Speaker 9>[inaudible]</v>

2523
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.800
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

2524
01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:45.950
<v Speaker 5>that's such a great story.</v>

2525
01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:50.980
<v Speaker 5>Like going from a guy just with an idea in his head who started doing open mics</v>

2526
01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:54.530
<v Speaker 5>and from there become a professional comedian.</v>

2527
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean working the door,</v>

2528
01:09:55.641 --> 01:09:56.690
<v Speaker 5>worked in the cover booth,</v>

2529
01:09:56.691 --> 01:09:57.471
<v Speaker 5>doing all that shit,</v>

2530
01:09:57.471 --> 01:09:58.400
<v Speaker 5>answering phones,</v>

2531
01:09:58.730 --> 01:10:00.050
<v Speaker 5>doing all the shit the comics do.</v>

2532
01:10:00.051 --> 01:10:05.030
<v Speaker 5>Like that's one of the few places in the country where comics go from just being</v>

2533
01:10:05.031 --> 01:10:07.930
<v Speaker 5>employees of the club to like national headliners.</v>

2534
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:08.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2535
01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:10.010
<v Speaker 4>Same thing with rand is easy.</v>

2536
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:10.520
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2537
01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:13.040
<v Speaker 4>It was just finishing up when I was arriving.</v>

2538
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:14.780
<v Speaker 4>Like he wasn't working there anymore.</v>

2539
01:10:14.781 --> 01:10:18.560
<v Speaker 4>But you heard that he would talk about working there?</v>

2540
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:19.290
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2541
01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:20.340
<v Speaker 5>Like I met him,</v>

2542
01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:22.740
<v Speaker 5>he worked there and now I know as a TV star.</v>

2543
01:10:23.370 --> 01:10:23.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2544
01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:25.320
<v Speaker 5>I would come by to do sets.</v>

2545
01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:28.560
<v Speaker 5>I think when I was on news radio or maybe it might've been fear factor.</v>

2546
01:10:28.561 --> 01:10:30.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't know which one it was when I first met him.</v>

2547
01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:30.740
<v Speaker 5>Hold on.</v>

2548
01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:31.770
<v Speaker 5>When Brenda's easy start.</v>

2549
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:33.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>

2550
01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:34.081

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.010
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2576
01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:05.521
<v Speaker 5>That's weird.</v>

2577
01:11:05.521 --> 01:11:05.800
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2578
01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.633
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

2579
01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:09.150
<v Speaker 5>Do you think time is moving faster?</v>

2580
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:10.103
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2581
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:11.303
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

2582
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:14.150
<v Speaker 5>Perfect dancer.</v>

2583
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:15.930
<v Speaker 6>That was probing stoner talk.</v>

2584
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:18.061
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>

2585
01:11:18.061 --> 01:11:18.894
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>

2586
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:23.880
<v Speaker 6>Followed by a long run on sentence where I throw in a bunch of likes,</v>

2587
01:11:23.881 --> 01:11:24.960
<v Speaker 6>so like I was like,</v>

2588
01:11:25.770 --> 01:11:27.720
<v Speaker 6>maybe like time is like different</v>

2589
01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:31.410
<v Speaker 10>me.</v>

2590
01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:34.100
<v Speaker 10>I was freaking out about the Berenstain bears,</v>

2591
01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:35.600
<v Speaker 10>the spelling of the last name.</v>

2592
01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:36.410
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

2593
01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:37.243
<v Speaker 10>it's different.</v>

2594
01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.070
<v Speaker 10>It's different and it wasn't always like that.</v>

2595
01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:42.293
<v Speaker 10>It's always been like that</v>

2596
01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:45.760
<v Speaker 10>and it's stain.</v>

2597
01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:47.350
<v Speaker 10>Wait,</v>

2598
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:48.183
<v Speaker 10>wait,</v>

2599
01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:52.101
<v Speaker 10>what is it?</v>

2600
01:11:52.101 --> 01:11:53.360
<v Speaker 10>What do they call it in the Matrix?</v>

2601
01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:54.860
<v Speaker 10>In the matrix</v>

2602
01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.110
<v Speaker 10>spelled like stain</v>

2603
01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:01.653
<v Speaker 10>stain,</v>

2604
01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:05.090
<v Speaker 10>but I swear it was Berenstein I've been cost.</v>

2605
01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:07.240
<v Speaker 10>Most people don't know what the fuck</v>

2606
01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:10.221
<v Speaker 6>we're talking about.</v>

2607
01:12:10.221 --> 01:12:13.070
<v Speaker 6>A series of children's children's books.</v>

2608
01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:18.880
<v Speaker 10>I said barren Steen and someone corrected me and then I looked at it and I was</v>

2609
01:12:19.461 --> 01:12:19.670
<v Speaker 10>like,</v>

2610
01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:20.503
<v Speaker 10>oh yeah,</v>

2611
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.530
<v Speaker 10>Ooh.</v>

2612
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:23.270
<v Speaker 10>Like why did I think it said steam?</v>

2613
01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:25.700
<v Speaker 10>It was like I didn't continue the sentence.</v>

2614
01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:28.310
<v Speaker 10>I got to Barron's and there's an end of the end.</v>

2615
01:12:28.311 --> 01:12:28.990
<v Speaker 10>I'm like steam.</v>

2616
01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:29.823
<v Speaker 10>It must be seen.</v>

2617
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:30.530
<v Speaker 10>Like I didn't,</v>

2618
01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:32.870
<v Speaker 10>I didn't even like attempt to read it.</v>

2619
01:12:33.070 --> 01:12:36.980
<v Speaker 10>Like I realize like sometimes words are so similar to other words that you don't</v>

2620
01:12:36.981 --> 01:12:37.814
<v Speaker 10>really read them.</v>

2621
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:38.361
<v Speaker 10>You kind of know,</v>

2622
01:12:38.361 --> 01:12:39.230
<v Speaker 10>oh I know what that is,</v>

2623
01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.390
<v Speaker 10>but you don't go and you just,</v>

2624
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:41.661
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>

2625
01:12:41.661 --> 01:12:42.411
<v Speaker 10>Barron's dean,</v>

2626
01:12:42.411 --> 01:12:46.790
<v Speaker 10>you know Wolfowitz if you saw like Wolfowitz but like one of the letters was</v>

2627
01:12:46.791 --> 01:12:47.360
<v Speaker 10>different,</v>

2628
01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.850
<v Speaker 10>you'd still probably say Wolfowitz cause you put it in.</v>

2629
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.090
<v Speaker 10>I go and I've seen that before and he just looked to save time.</v>

2630
01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:53.691
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

2631
01:12:53.691 --> 01:12:53.871
<v Speaker 10>you,</v>

2632
01:12:53.871 --> 01:12:54.150
<v Speaker 10>you,</v>

2633
01:12:54.150 --> 01:12:54.740
<v Speaker 10>you say it.</v>

2634
01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:57.440
<v Speaker 10>So for all of us that thought,</v>

2635
01:12:57.441 --> 01:13:00.080
<v Speaker 10>I mean it was just one of those things like you never really read the word.</v>

2636
01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:01.123
<v Speaker 10>Did you pull it up</v>

2637
01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:04.550
<v Speaker 10>Congress if though right?</v>

2638
01:13:04.551 --> 01:13:05.460
<v Speaker 10>Isn't that what we did?</v>

2639
01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:07.840
<v Speaker 10>We talk about this curse too much.</v>

2640
01:13:08.190 --> 01:13:09.410
<v Speaker 10>It's just show these,</v>

2641
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:11.720
<v Speaker 10>well I bet show that ease people at home.</v>

2642
01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:12.670
<v Speaker 10>What the fuck we're talking about.</v>

2643
01:13:12.730 --> 01:13:13.670
<v Speaker 10>I thought it was a neat too,</v>

2644
01:13:13.671 --> 01:13:16.360
<v Speaker 10>so I bet it's one of those curse a phase that looks like and</v>

2645
01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:18.920
<v Speaker 10>I don't think it is man.</v>

2646
01:13:18.921 --> 01:13:21.230
<v Speaker 10>I think it's just the way it's a straight up stain.</v>

2647
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:22.663
<v Speaker 10>Something happens.</v>

2648
01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:25.853
<v Speaker 10>Something happens,</v>

2649
01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.260
<v Speaker 10>seriously convinced for so long.</v>

2650
01:13:28.290 --> 01:13:31.280
<v Speaker 10>I went like three days just like looking like a crazy person.</v>

2651
01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.390
<v Speaker 10>Bernstein bears.</v>

2652
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:35.221
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

2653
01:13:35.221 --> 01:13:35.750
<v Speaker 10>it doesn't.</v>

2654
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:37.460
<v Speaker 10>It looks like that a should be an e.</v>

2655
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:41.900
<v Speaker 10>But I think it's one of those things you just sort of chunk those words together</v>

2656
01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:42.760
<v Speaker 10>that lettered the,</v>

2657
01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.120
<v Speaker 10>all those letters in your memory.</v>

2658
01:13:46.210 --> 01:13:49.140
<v Speaker 10>I remember that there was a ais.</v>

2659
01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:51.640
<v Speaker 10>I think that,</v>

2660
01:13:51.650 --> 01:13:52.483
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

2661
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:54.200
<v Speaker 10>I think it's one of those things you don't,</v>

2662
01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:55.100
<v Speaker 10>you just don't read it.</v>

2663
01:13:56.290 --> 01:13:57.123
<v Speaker 10>If everyone was already</v>

2664
01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:58.953
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

2665
01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.830
<v Speaker 6>name his last name.</v>

2666
01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:01.820
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2667
01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.920
<v Speaker 6>So stupid in this Dane.</v>

2668
01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:06.070
<v Speaker 10>You good say what's wrong with Barrett's thing?</v>

2669
01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:07.901
<v Speaker 10>That's silly.</v>

2670
01:14:07.901 --> 01:14:09.700
<v Speaker 10>Bernstein is just as ridiculous.</v>

2671
01:14:09.970 --> 01:14:10.151
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

2672
01:14:10.151 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 10>I thought it was Berenstain the whole time.</v>

2673
01:14:12.041 --> 01:14:16.420
<v Speaker 10>It must be one of those tracks where it was like you see two e's before and then</v>

2674
01:14:16.421 --> 01:14:18.200
<v Speaker 10>you think the third one's gotta be an easier thing.</v>

2675
01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.300
<v Speaker 10>It's like pop and soda.</v>

2676
01:14:19.301 --> 01:14:21.420
<v Speaker 10>I think that just where you're like your mom,</v>

2677
01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:22.330
<v Speaker 10>your parents where it's like,</v>

2678
01:14:22.331 --> 01:14:22.481
<v Speaker 10>yeah.</v>

2679
01:14:22.481 --> 01:14:23.420
<v Speaker 10>Marin's stain.</v>

2680
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:29.050
<v Speaker 10>Oh well that would make sense.</v>

2681
01:14:29.051 --> 01:14:33.500
<v Speaker 10>Berenstein Berenstain and you'd say dean.</v>

2682
01:14:33.690 --> 01:14:34.320
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2683
01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:35.170
<v Speaker 10>What'd I say?</v>

2684
01:14:38.610 --> 01:14:39.670
<v Speaker 10>Getting to be more and more.</v>

2685
01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:43.330
<v Speaker 10>He'll bill t e I n it strictly,</v>

2686
01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:44.690
<v Speaker 10>what's the name of those Jew?</v>

2687
01:14:44.691 --> 01:14:45.524
<v Speaker 10>Bayer's</v>

2688
01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:49.463
<v Speaker 10>Barron.</v>

2689
01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:56.670
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2690
01:14:56.670 --> 01:15:00.160
<v Speaker 10>It's like you ever wonder like why certain languages came up with certain,</v>

2691
01:15:00.161 --> 01:15:05.161
<v Speaker 10>sounds like some languages have beautiful flowing melodic sounds to them.</v>

2692
01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:07.540
<v Speaker 10>Like they have like a rhythm to them.</v>

2693
01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:09.520
<v Speaker 10>Like if you ever heard someone speaking Portuguese,</v>

2694
01:15:09.521 --> 01:15:11.140
<v Speaker 10>like the Brazilians that speaks Portuguese,</v>

2695
01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.800
<v Speaker 10>it's such a cool sound language,</v>

2696
01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:14.080
<v Speaker 10>Blah bishop.</v>

2697
01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:19.180
<v Speaker 10>Whether they have this like sort of like almost like they're dancing like this</v>

2698
01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:21.160
<v Speaker 10>flow to it and then you'll hear like,</v>

2699
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:26.310
<v Speaker 10>like some like really harsh German [inaudible] Bush didn't like really like,</v>

2700
01:15:26.970 --> 01:15:27.803
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

2701
01:15:27.850 --> 01:15:31.870
<v Speaker 10>it's like this weird sort of like guttural and then like you know some of the</v>

2702
01:15:31.871 --> 01:15:33.700
<v Speaker 10>Sephardic languages and it's,</v>

2703
01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:34.560
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

2704
01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:37.420
<v Speaker 10>it's some crazy ass noises.</v>

2705
01:15:37.421 --> 01:15:39.280
<v Speaker 10>You know Canadians a,</v>

2706
01:15:39.281 --> 01:15:41.150
<v Speaker 10>Oh that's about as normal as you get.</v>

2707
01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:44.850
<v Speaker 10>Add a little a to some words about it.</v>

2708
01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.770
<v Speaker 10>They're just a little far up north.</v>

2709
01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:48.790
<v Speaker 10>They're all too,</v>

2710
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:49.810
<v Speaker 10>don't be picking out Canadian.</v>

2711
01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:52.540
<v Speaker 10>The bear chosen people as far as I'm concerned.</v>

2712
01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.080
<v Speaker 10>The Berenstain bears had this one book called new neighbors and I always thought</v>

2713
01:15:56.081 --> 01:16:00.430
<v Speaker 10>it seemed racist because it was like Asian panda bears that moved in and look</v>

2720
01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.150

2721
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:28.560
<v Speaker 10>it's hilarious.</v>

2722
01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:31.730
<v Speaker 10>They're even wearing kind of like colorful,</v>

2723
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:33.020
<v Speaker 10>festive Chinese colors.</v>

2724
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:36.400
<v Speaker 10>Those are definitely Chinese outfits.</v>

2725
01:16:36.401 --> 01:16:37.480
<v Speaker 10>Like look at how it's cut.</v>

2726
01:16:37.481 --> 01:16:40.030
<v Speaker 10>And it's like the shirts go all the way up to the chin.</v>

2727
01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:44.260
<v Speaker 10>Fucking panda bears all wearing the same.</v>

2728
01:16:44.410 --> 01:16:46.360
<v Speaker 10>If somebody tried to release that today,</v>

2729
01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.640
<v Speaker 10>like salon.com would be all over it.</v>

2730
01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.133
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2731
01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:52.270
<v Speaker 10>Subtle racism and children's stories.</v>

2732
01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:53.680
<v Speaker 10>Why it's wrong.</v>

2733
01:16:55.330 --> 01:16:57.170
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2734
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:58.090
<v Speaker 10>Finding racist.</v>

2735
01:16:58.090 --> 01:16:59.830
<v Speaker 10>But I think that is exactly what that was.</v>

2736
01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:01.000
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

2737
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.020
<v Speaker 10>that's not clever.</v>

2738
01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:05.140
<v Speaker 10>They're not hiding that panda.</v>

2739
01:17:05.190 --> 01:17:06.520
<v Speaker 10>But why isn't it black pairs?</v>

2740
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:07.623
<v Speaker 10>You guys are Brown.</v>

2741
01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:08.710
<v Speaker 10>Have some black bears move in.</v>

2742
01:17:08.711 --> 01:17:09.050
<v Speaker 10>No.</v>

2743
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.883
<v Speaker 10>Too Edgy</v>

2744
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.870
<v Speaker 5>against black people.</v>

2745
01:17:11.871 --> 01:17:12.471
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2746
01:17:12.471 --> 01:17:13.640
<v Speaker 5>So they had to go with pandas.</v>

2747
01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:15.650
<v Speaker 5>Is Asians fucking,</v>

2748
01:17:15.651 --> 01:17:19.100
<v Speaker 5>they keep their eye on their business and they fucking keep moving forward.</v>

2749
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.360
<v Speaker 5>They don't riot.</v>

2750
01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 5>Asian people don't close off the fucking four oh five they're nice and they get</v>

2751
01:17:24.951 --> 01:17:25.784
<v Speaker 5>things done.</v>

2752
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:26.061
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2753
01:17:26.061 --> 01:17:27.680
<v Speaker 5>They don't get caught up in bullshit.</v>

2754
01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:28.550
<v Speaker 5>But if you,</v>

2755
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:29.870
<v Speaker 5>if you use black bears,</v>

2756
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:30.763
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>

2757
01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:33.653
<v Speaker 5>dark skin,</v>

2758
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:35.900
<v Speaker 5>light skin did bears versus dark skin.</v>

2759
01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:37.910
<v Speaker 5>But polar bears come in and fuck up everything.</v>

2760
01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.590
<v Speaker 5>They've chose.</v>

2761
01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:42.020
<v Speaker 5>Black and white ethnically ambiguous</v>

2762
01:17:44.050 --> 01:17:44.740
<v Speaker 5>skin.</v>

2763
01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:45.573
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2764
01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:46.520
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

2765
01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:46.860
<v Speaker 5>Their hair.</v>

2766
01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:47.693
<v Speaker 5>It's clear.</v>

2767
01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.010
<v Speaker 5>It's not actually white.</v>

2768
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:49.903
<v Speaker 5>It's clear.</v>

2769
01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:51.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2770
01:17:51.130 --> 01:17:51.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2771
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:54.290
<v Speaker 5>See if he could pull up a picture of polar bear skin.</v>

2772
01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.190
<v Speaker 5>Polar bear hair.</v>

2773
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:57.140
<v Speaker 5>Clear polar bear hair clear.</v>

2774
01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:57.561
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2775
01:17:57.561 --> 01:17:58.011
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

2776
01:17:58.011 --> 01:17:58.521
<v Speaker 5>It's like a,</v>

2777
01:17:58.521 --> 01:17:59.121
<v Speaker 5>almost like,</v>

2778
01:17:59.121 --> 01:18:02.360
<v Speaker 5>you know those fibers that they use those light fibers.</v>

2779
01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:03.733
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2780
01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:05.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2781
01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:05.660
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2782
01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:06.320
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2783
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.280
<v Speaker 5>The fiber optics,</v>

2784
01:18:07.281 --> 01:18:08.114
<v Speaker 5>like that kind of shit.</v>

2785
01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:09.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's what it looks like almost.</v>

2786
01:18:09.411 --> 01:18:09.771
<v Speaker 5>It's like a,</v>

2787
01:18:09.771 --> 01:18:11.030
<v Speaker 5>a natural white,</v>

2788
01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.430
<v Speaker 5>but it's like a natural clear rather.</v>

2789
01:18:13.431 --> 01:18:14.690
<v Speaker 5>But altogether they look white.</v>

2790
01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:16.760
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2791
01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:17.481
<v Speaker 5>is there a bald,</v>

2792
01:18:17.481 --> 01:18:19.700
<v Speaker 5>is there a picture of like a bald skin,</v>

2793
01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:21.680
<v Speaker 5>but see if you could pull up a polar bear.</v>

2794
01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:23.180
<v Speaker 5>Heres a ball.</v>

2795
01:18:23.181 --> 01:18:23.661
<v Speaker 5>Polar bear.</v>

2796
01:18:23.661 --> 01:18:24.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they don't live.</v>

2797
01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:27.950
<v Speaker 5>Like some bears get mange and they survive,</v>

2798
01:18:27.951 --> 01:18:32.230
<v Speaker 5>but polar bears live exclusively in polar habitat.</v>

2799
01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.650
<v Speaker 5>That's what their hair looks like.</v>

2800
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:35.810
<v Speaker 5>That's not a good picture.</v>

2801
01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:37.060
<v Speaker 5>But you get a sense of it.</v>

2802
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.310
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2803
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:39.110
<v Speaker 5>it's more clear that it does look pretty white,</v>

2804
01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.110
<v Speaker 5>but apparently it's clear like technically,</v>

2805
01:18:42.111 --> 01:18:44.540
<v Speaker 5>so there's just a complete absence of color.</v>

2806
01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:47.870
<v Speaker 5>So then they take all those together and they look white when they're on the</v>

2807
01:18:47.871 --> 01:18:48.704
<v Speaker 5>animal.</v>

2808
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:49.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2809
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:50.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean it is white.</v>

2810
01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:51.560
<v Speaker 5>Obviously it's white,</v>

2811
01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.560
<v Speaker 5>but they think they consider it clear,</v>

2812
01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:59.860
<v Speaker 5>so our brain reads it as white Berenstain bears these days.</v>

2813
01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:05.540
<v Speaker 5>Awful to grow up with</v>

2814
01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:11.060
<v Speaker 5>these racist parents writing these polar bear bucks.</v>

2815
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:16.040
<v Speaker 5>Imagine what kind of Shit life you must've led to come back as a polar bear.</v>

2816
01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:17.960
<v Speaker 5>What a Dick.</v>

2817
01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:21.830
<v Speaker 5>Can you say that you say that you don't want to live up there?</v>

2818
01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:23.450
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like a lonely world.</v>

2819
01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:26.110
<v Speaker 5>You can always come back as like a magnet</v>

2820
01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:29.360
<v Speaker 5>that would suck worse.</v>

2821
01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:32.720
<v Speaker 5>Someone has the glass half full.</v>

2822
01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:38.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2823
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:40.160
<v Speaker 5>but being a polar bear would be especially sucky.</v>

2824
01:19:40.410 --> 01:19:40.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2825
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:41.750
<v Speaker 5>Freezing cold,</v>

2826
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:43.220
<v Speaker 5>jumping in the water all the time.</v>

2827
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:44.960
<v Speaker 5>All you're eating is like seals,</v>

2828
01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.790
<v Speaker 5>shit and drinking coca cola.</v>

2829
01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:51.410
<v Speaker 5>What would you do for a Klondike Bar?</v>

2830
01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.990
<v Speaker 5>I think you could be fun.</v>

2831
01:19:53.991 --> 01:19:56.150
<v Speaker 5>There could be some positives like name them,</v>

2832
01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:57.890
<v Speaker 5>like sliding around on the ice.</v>

2833
01:19:58.300 --> 01:19:59.120
<v Speaker 5>You can do that.</v>

2834
01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:02.090
<v Speaker 5>You can do that and you're a person throwing up bear party.</v>

2835
01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:04.370
<v Speaker 5>They'd get more hurt as a person.</v>

2836
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:06.950
<v Speaker 5>You would get more hurt sliding around.</v>

2837
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 5>You'd be less durable.</v>

2838
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:08.460
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

2839
01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:11.010
<v Speaker 10>like just the thought of sliding around on my polar bear belly.</v>

2840
01:20:11.011 --> 01:20:12.300
<v Speaker 10>That would be super fun.</v>

2841
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:13.583
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>

2849
01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:21.180
<v Speaker 10>I haven't done it in quite some time,</v>

2850
01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:22.201
<v Speaker 10>but yes,</v>

2851
01:20:22.201 --> 01:20:23.034
<v Speaker 10>I've done it.</v>

2852
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:26.440
<v Speaker 10>It's a child's game actually.</v>

2853
01:20:26.450 --> 01:20:27.570
<v Speaker 10>Get everyone's done it right.</v>

2854
01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.291
<v Speaker 10>It has never been done.</v>

2855
01:20:28.291 --> 01:20:29.124
<v Speaker 10>Slipping side.</v>

2856
01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:33.450
<v Speaker 10>That's not something you like trying to shock them with your knowledge thing</v>

2857
01:20:33.451 --> 01:20:34.710
<v Speaker 10>that I did when I was young.</v>

2858
01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:36.730
<v Speaker 10>There's an adult one that they are,</v>

2859
01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:38.540
<v Speaker 10>they're trying to actually put a,</v>

2860
01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:39.960
<v Speaker 10>it's called slide the city.</v>

2861
01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:40.381
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>

2862
01:20:40.381 --> 01:20:41.191
<v Speaker 10>and there actually where you,</v>

2863
01:20:41.191 --> 01:20:45.300
<v Speaker 10>it's adult slipped inside throughout the whole entire city of Los Angeles.</v>

2864
01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:48.930
<v Speaker 10>They got a water slide in Brazil where you go like 55 miles an hour.</v>

2865
01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:50.100
<v Speaker 10>That's awesome.</v>

2866
01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.510
<v Speaker 10>The fastest water slide.</v>

2867
01:20:51.511 --> 01:20:53.940
<v Speaker 10>See if you could pull up the fastest waterslide Brazil.</v>

2868
01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:55.080
<v Speaker 10>That's a giant slip and slide.</v>

2869
01:20:55.081 --> 01:20:55.621
<v Speaker 10>That's hilarious.</v>

2870
01:20:55.621 --> 01:20:57.150
<v Speaker 10>The whole city of Los Angeles.</v>

2871
01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:00.090
<v Speaker 10>So you slide through the whole city and one push.</v>

2872
01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:00.630
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

2873
01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:03.420
<v Speaker 10>I think it's the water moves you a little,</v>

2874
01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:04.380
<v Speaker 10>but oh,</v>

2875
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:05.850
<v Speaker 10>and we all can't shower for a week.</v>

2876
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:10.290
<v Speaker 10>You gotta be careful about waterparks.</v>

2877
01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:13.740
<v Speaker 10>I know a chick whose daughter got sick from a waterpark and she want to be in</v>

2878
01:21:13.741 --> 01:21:14.820
<v Speaker 10>partially paralyzed.</v>

2879
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:17.970
<v Speaker 10>She had some sort of infection getting into her ear and it became like</v>

2880
01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:19.350
<v Speaker 10>meningitis or something like that.</v>

2881
01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:22.170
<v Speaker 10>Waterparks can get nasty man.</v>

2882
01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:25.560
<v Speaker 10>All these little kids are shit in that water and all these weird people are</v>

2883
01:21:25.561 --> 01:21:27.510
<v Speaker 10>traveling around in their diseases.</v>

2884
01:21:27.511 --> 01:21:29.370
<v Speaker 10>It's just a breeding ground for bacteria.</v>

2885
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:30.960
<v Speaker 10>That's why when you go to a lot of them,</v>

2886
01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:36.170
<v Speaker 10>they just reek of chemicals to just pour in fucking coring and that water to</v>

2887
01:21:36.271 --> 01:21:38.280
<v Speaker 10>kill everything and you get in and you're like,</v>

2888
01:21:38.281 --> 01:21:38.761
<v Speaker 10>Whoa,</v>

2889
01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:40.500
<v Speaker 10>like I'm bathing in chemicals here.</v>

2890
01:21:40.501 --> 01:21:42.060
<v Speaker 10>This doesn't even feel like water.</v>

2891
01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:43.163
<v Speaker 10>You know?</v>

2892
01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:45.660
<v Speaker 10>And it's kind of warm too.</v>

2893
01:21:45.661 --> 01:21:49.770
<v Speaker 10>There's a bunch of people in the water and warm water and everyone's just pissed</v>

2894
01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:50.604
<v Speaker 10>and</v>

2895
01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:56.370
<v Speaker 10>can see like the sunblock splotches.</v>

2896
01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:00.330
<v Speaker 10>They should do like they should take like a scoop and bring it to a lab and find</v>

2897
01:22:00.331 --> 01:22:02.520
<v Speaker 10>out exactly how much of that water is pissed and shit.</v>

2898
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.940
<v Speaker 10>It's like a measurable amount.</v>

2899
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:06.833
<v Speaker 10>I'll admit I do it</v>

2900
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:10.140
<v Speaker 10>get the worse.</v>

2901
01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.860
<v Speaker 10>They just have this thing at the admit you do it.</v>

2902
01:22:13.890 --> 01:22:14.723
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2903
01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:16.500
<v Speaker 10>If I'm in in that like a waterpark.</v>

2904
01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:17.881
<v Speaker 10>Oh fuck.</v>

2905
01:22:17.881 --> 01:22:18.130
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2906
01:22:18.130 --> 01:22:19.200
<v Speaker 10>It's like when in Rome.</v>

2907
01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.310
<v Speaker 10>I mean it feels good for the p around.</v>

2908
01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:23.213
<v Speaker 10>It's warm.</v>

2909
01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:27.210
<v Speaker 10>You're trying to be silly or do you really pay when you go to a waterpark?</v>

2910
01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.260
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

2911
01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:29.011
<v Speaker 10>I think he does.</v>

2912
01:22:29.011 --> 01:22:30.630
<v Speaker 10>I don't even think he's in the pool when he does it.</v>

2913
01:22:30.631 --> 01:22:33.030
<v Speaker 10>I think he's standing outside of the pool and do it.</v>

2914
01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.490
<v Speaker 10>He's the guy which is pissing his pants.</v>

2915
01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.353
<v Speaker 10>Jumps in the water,</v>

2916
01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:39.300
<v Speaker 10>wait till a kid swim spa.</v>

2917
01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:42.950
<v Speaker 10>Wait,</v>

2918
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:44.700
<v Speaker 10>Kid Swims by and you pee on kids.</v>

2919
01:22:44.701 --> 01:22:45.330
<v Speaker 10>Is that what you're saying?</v>

2920
01:22:45.330 --> 01:22:45.571
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

2921
01:22:45.571 --> 01:22:47.100
<v Speaker 10>it's like blowing a fighter on a kid.</v>

2922
01:22:47.101 --> 01:22:47.850
<v Speaker 10>That's hilarious.</v>

2923
01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:48.950
<v Speaker 10>Have you ever heard her on a kid?</v>

2924
01:22:48.951 --> 01:22:51.670
<v Speaker 10>There's a big difference being blown apart on a kid and pissing on him.</v>

2925
01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:53.363
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

2926
01:22:54.230 --> 01:22:55.063
<v Speaker 10>And your parents,</v>

2927
01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:55.620
<v Speaker 10>kids.</v>

2928
01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:57.870
<v Speaker 10>Parents might be upset if you fart on their kid,</v>

2929
01:22:58.260 --> 01:22:59.810
<v Speaker 10>they'll beat your ass if you're peeing on him,</v>

2930
01:22:59.910 --> 01:23:00.810
<v Speaker 10>but they can never tell.</v>

2931
01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:02.550
<v Speaker 10>It's the only Legal Way to pee on a kid.</v>

2932
01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:04.370
<v Speaker 10>What do you mean they can never tell them?</v>

2933
01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.250
<v Speaker 10>They will never know if I pee on the kid.</v>

2934
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.881
<v Speaker 8>Is it illegal?</v>

2935
01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:07.450
<v Speaker 8>Appear on here.</v>

2936
01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:10.720
<v Speaker 8>It definitely is a legal to PR on a kid unless you're in a Kelly doesn't seem to</v>

2937
01:23:10.721 --> 01:23:11.554
<v Speaker 8>think it is.</v>

2938
01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:12.340
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2939
01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:13.690
<v Speaker 8>he was his,</v>

2940
01:23:13.691 --> 01:23:17.020
<v Speaker 8>it wasn't just being charged with peeing on the girls being charged with having</v>

2941
01:23:17.021 --> 01:23:19.510
<v Speaker 8>sex with an underage girl I guess.</v>

2942
01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:19.920
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

2943
01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:20.171
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2944
01:23:20.171 --> 01:23:23.380
<v Speaker 8>I think it would have been okay at even at a water park that according to Brian,</v>

2945
01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:24.630
<v Speaker 8>she called it pee pee.</v>

2946
01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:27.153
<v Speaker 8>Totally count.</v>

2947
01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.850
<v Speaker 8>So she didn't say Piss your honor.</v>

2948
01:23:31.810 --> 01:23:33.040
<v Speaker 8>Motion to dismiss.</v>

2949
01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:34.760
<v Speaker 8>The girl said Pp.</v>

2950
01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:36.370
<v Speaker 8>Mr. Kelly said Piss.</v>

2951
01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:38.620
<v Speaker 8>So clearly we're talking about two different things.</v>

2952
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:40.833
<v Speaker 8>One of them is</v>

2953
01:23:42.010 --> 01:23:43.780
<v Speaker 8>more cultural significance attached to it.</v>

2954
01:23:44.710 --> 01:23:46.570
<v Speaker 8>This is a strange time for race relations,</v>

2955
01:23:46.571 --> 01:23:47.040
<v Speaker 8>isn't it?</v>

2956
01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:47.501
<v Speaker 8>If you noticed,</v>

2957
01:23:47.501 --> 01:23:50.770
<v Speaker 8>this is a very tense time in America for race relations,</v>

2958
01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:55.180
<v Speaker 8>black storm trooper to equal at all out though is they're going to help.</v>

2959
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:56.830
<v Speaker 8>I don't know,</v>

2960
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:57.611
<v Speaker 8>but there are bad guys,</v>

2961
01:23:57.611 --> 01:23:58.510
<v Speaker 8>stormtroopers or bad guy.</v>

2962
01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:02.150
<v Speaker 8>I think he's a good guy that is playing a bad guy for a second.</v>

2963
01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:04.720
<v Speaker 8>Then preview that we saw stole a costume and he's like,</v>

2964
01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:04.991

01:24:04.991 --> 01:24:06.060
<v Speaker 8>don't say this.</v>

2966
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.970
<v Speaker 8>Spoiler alert.</v>

2967
01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:09.100
<v Speaker 8>Fuck Jesus Christ.</v>

2968
01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:09.351
<v Speaker 8>No one,</v>

2969
01:24:09.351 --> 01:24:10.121
<v Speaker 8>no one knows that.</v>

2970
01:24:10.121 --> 01:24:11.260
<v Speaker 8>That's just a guess.</v>

2971
01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:11.711
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

2972

01:24:56.981 --> 01:24:58.210
<v Speaker 8>Then James Franco,</v>

2996
01:24:58.211 --> 01:24:58.991
<v Speaker 8>Seth Rogan,</v>

2997
01:24:58.991 --> 01:25:01.450
<v Speaker 8>and it's just dirty shit.</v>

2998
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:03.183
<v Speaker 8>And they're just,</v>

2999
01:25:03.450 --> 01:25:05.440
<v Speaker 8>it's just like all the other like leaks.</v>

3000
01:25:05.441 --> 01:25:06.790
<v Speaker 8>They've been slowly leaking it.</v>

3001
01:25:06.791 --> 01:25:10.000
<v Speaker 8>And releasing new stuff that's just fucked up now.</v>

3002
01:25:10.001 --> 01:25:11.440
<v Speaker 8>What do you think they're trying to do there?</v>

3003
01:25:11.530 --> 01:25:12.070
<v Speaker 8>When you're there,</v>

3004
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:14.170
<v Speaker 8>you think they're trying to shut down Sony.</v>

3005
01:25:14.171 --> 01:25:16.600
<v Speaker 8>Do you think they're trying to just have fun?</v>

3006
01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:18.400
<v Speaker 8>I uh,</v>

3007
01:25:18.490 --> 01:25:22.120
<v Speaker 8>I don't know that cause they don't really know for sure who's doing it.</v>

3008
01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:24.790
<v Speaker 8>At first they thought it was North Korea because of that.</v>

3009
01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:24.940
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

3010
01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:25.480
<v Speaker 8>that's right.</v>

3011
01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:26.350
<v Speaker 8>Cause that new movie,</v>

3012
01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:30.690
<v Speaker 8>I honestly think it's just angry Asians that uh,</v>

3013
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:31.750
<v Speaker 8>because of that movie,</v>

3014
01:25:31.751 --> 01:25:33.310
<v Speaker 8>they have no connection with North Korea.</v>

3015
01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:34.330
<v Speaker 8>But God,</v>

3016
01:25:34.331 --> 01:25:39.331
<v Speaker 8>you're here to give your doctor Brian fucking work done whatsoever.</v>

3017
01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:40.120
<v Speaker 8>I to the,</v>

3018
01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:41.860
<v Speaker 8>and I'm just saying when I say stuff like that,</v>

3019
01:25:41.861 --> 01:25:42.730
<v Speaker 8>it's like if I had to guess,</v>

3020
01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:43.521
<v Speaker 8>but doesn't the,</v>

3021
01:25:43.521 --> 01:25:45.580
<v Speaker 8>the North Korea thing makes sense,</v>

3022
01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.120
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

3023
01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:46.361
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

3024
01:25:46.361 --> 01:25:50.800
<v Speaker 8>especially if they're released it and change Franco and Seth Rogen information</v>

3025
01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.300
<v Speaker 8>when they were on that movie together,</v>

3026
01:25:52.450 --> 01:25:56.020
<v Speaker 8>that was about assassinating the president of North Korea.</v>

3027
01:25:56.021 --> 01:25:56.350
<v Speaker 8>Right,</v>

3028
01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:56.950
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>

3029
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:57.311
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

3030
01:25:57.311 --> 01:25:58.870
<v Speaker 8>they have hackers working for them.</v>

3031
01:25:58.871 --> 01:25:59.704
<v Speaker 8>They must.</v>

3032

<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3033
01:26:00.161 --> 01:26:01.460
<v Speaker 8>But there was a whole article about it,</v>

3034
01:26:01.461 --> 01:26:03.470
<v Speaker 8>which they're not really good at much there.</v>

3035
01:26:03.471 --> 01:26:04.304
<v Speaker 8>Like they build,</v>

3036
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:07.460
<v Speaker 5>they build rockets that just like fall over when they hit,</v>

3037
01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:08.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3039
01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:10.331
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

3040
01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:12.900
<v Speaker 5>they're now listening to Tame Creek.</v>

3041
01:26:13.130 --> 01:26:15.020
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that the one place where they don't listen?</v>

3042
01:26:15.021 --> 01:26:17.480
<v Speaker 5>You say that about how the fuck did they find out about this James Franco,</v>

3043
01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.940
<v Speaker 5>obviously they're paying attention.</v>

3044
01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:20.560
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3045

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3282
01:32:44.930 --> 01:32:48.140
<v Speaker 4>And a word pops up and you have to pretend like you have a bit about that.</v>

3283
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:49.280
<v Speaker 4>You just roll with it.</v>

3284
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:50.810
<v Speaker 4>He ended up taking his pants down.</v>

3285
01:32:50.811 --> 01:32:54.040
<v Speaker 4>It was epic theater exploded because they're not,</v>

3286
01:32:54.050 --> 01:32:57.170
<v Speaker 4>you want to talk about going on the road and you know what you can do and</v>

3287
01:32:57.171 --> 01:32:57.801
<v Speaker 4>pushing the lines.</v>

3288
01:32:57.801 --> 01:32:57.921
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3289
01:32:57.921 --> 01:33:01.670
<v Speaker 4>they were really weren't expecting that in good old winter land.</v>

3290
01:33:01.671 --> 01:33:02.001
<v Speaker 4>Come on,</v>

3291
01:33:02.001 --> 01:33:03.140
<v Speaker 4>let me make you Cherry Pie.</v>

3292
01:33:03.141 --> 01:33:04.280
<v Speaker 4>Welcome to Travers city.</v>

3293
01:33:04.281 --> 01:33:05.330
<v Speaker 4>Like that's that Seti.</v>

3294
01:33:05.331 --> 01:33:06.350
<v Speaker 4>Dave Foley just goes,</v>

3295
01:33:06.351 --> 01:33:06.621
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

3296
01:33:06.621 --> 01:33:09.260
<v Speaker 4>Powell and I remember we were downstairs,</v>

3297
01:33:09.261 --> 01:33:10.640
<v Speaker 4>the green rooms in a basement.</v>

3298
01:33:10.641 --> 01:33:14.780
<v Speaker 4>You just heard this roar and there was a TV but it was muted and we're all</v>

3299
01:33:14.781 --> 01:33:18.350
<v Speaker 4>sitting in the green room and you hear this bra and we're like,</v>

3300
01:33:18.351 --> 01:33:18.891
<v Speaker 4>what the hell?</v>

3301
01:33:18.891 --> 01:33:20.890
<v Speaker 4>And you look and Dave Foley's pants where?</v>

3302
01:33:20.891 --> 01:33:22.940
<v Speaker 4>At his ankles on this TV in the green room.</v>

3303
01:33:22.941 --> 01:33:23.450
<v Speaker 4>And we're just like,</v>

3304
01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

3305
01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:25.820
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

3306
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3307
01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:28.010
<v Speaker 1>Fully is a killer joke writer man.</v>

3308
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.431
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3309
01:33:28.431 --> 01:33:28.621
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3310
01:33:28.621 --> 01:33:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I was crushed.</v>

3311
01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I was really happy when he decided to do some stand up because it was one of</v>

3312
01:33:33.231 --> 01:33:33.651
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

3313
01:33:33.651 --> 01:33:36.620
<v Speaker 1>It's the same kind of a thing where even though he's a,</v>

3314
01:33:36.621 --> 01:33:41.510
<v Speaker 1>an established actor and a established hilarious guy from kids in the hall,</v>

3315
01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:42.770
<v Speaker 1>there's still,</v>

3316
01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:44.210
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't always get work.</v>

3317
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:44.481
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3318
01:33:44.481 --> 01:33:46.240
<v Speaker 1>he's having a hard time getting gigs and you,</v>

3319
01:33:46.241 --> 01:33:46.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3320
01:33:46.431 --> 01:33:48.200
<v Speaker 1>you have to get picked to do gigs.</v>

3321
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:49.101
<v Speaker 1>It's just the way it is.</v>

3322
01:33:49.101 --> 01:33:49.940
<v Speaker 1>You get cast,</v>

3323
01:33:50.230 --> 01:33:50.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3324
01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:51.710
<v Speaker 1>or you do your own thing.</v>

3325
01:33:51.711 --> 01:33:54.860
<v Speaker 1>You create your own thing or you get cast and then the ultimate create your own</v>

3326
01:33:54.861 --> 01:33:55.041
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3327
01:33:55.041 --> 01:33:55.581
<v Speaker 1>You stand up.</v>

3328
01:33:55.581 --> 01:33:56.780
<v Speaker 1>So he just started doing stand up,</v>

3329
01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:57.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3330
01:33:57.710 --> 01:33:58.431
<v Speaker 1>I just want to see it.</v>

3331
01:33:58.431 --> 01:33:59.410
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen a standup.</v>

3332
01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:00.860
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine it'd be very funny.</v>

3333
01:34:01.130 --> 01:34:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3334
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:02.900
<v Speaker 1>He's just such a smart dude.</v>

3335
01:34:03.150 --> 01:34:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3336
01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:04.460
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the smartest people I know.</v>

3337
01:34:04.461 --> 01:34:05.930
<v Speaker 1>He's such a fascinating character.</v>

3338
01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:07.030
<v Speaker 4>Or would amaze me.</v>

3339
01:34:07.031 --> 01:34:10.450
<v Speaker 4>What really ended up stealing that festival for me was,</v>

3340
01:34:10.690 --> 01:34:11.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3341
01:34:11.250 --> 01:34:14.950
<v Speaker 4>Sinbad did a show and I was thinking of myself,</v>

3342
01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:15.181
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3343
01:34:15.181 --> 01:34:15.611
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

3344
01:34:15.611 --> 01:34:18.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go do this other show I'm going to through right after this spot.</v>

3345
01:34:18.871 --> 01:34:20.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna go do this because it's at the festivals.</v>

3346
01:34:20.591 --> 01:34:22.210
<v Speaker 4>There's always multiple spots you could do.</v>

3347
01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:27.130
<v Speaker 4>But I had a chance to sit in the back of the theater and watch Sinbad for a few</v>

3348
01:34:27.130 --> 01:34:29.410
<v Speaker 4>minutes and I was amazed.</v>

3349
01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:33.130
<v Speaker 4>Everything that I heard about him went out the window.</v>

3350
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:34.810
<v Speaker 4>When I saw Sinbad live,</v>

3351
01:34:34.990 --> 01:34:37.780
<v Speaker 4>I was honestly shocked at what he was doing.</v>

3352
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:42.870
<v Speaker 4>I was shocked because I was for sure thinking I was going to watch every single</v>

3353
01:34:43.391 --> 01:34:46.120
<v Speaker 4>thing that I've been told about him is that he's a hack.</v>

3354
01:34:46.121 --> 01:34:46.721
<v Speaker 4>He's this,</v>

3355
01:34:46.721 --> 01:34:48.560
<v Speaker 4>he's that Bobby by sucks,</v>

3356
01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:53.140
<v Speaker 4>he's washed up and next thing you know I'm sitting in the back of this theater,</v>

3357
01:34:53.141 --> 01:34:55.870
<v Speaker 4>just slow clapping like that.</v>

3358
01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:57.070
<v Speaker 4>I swear.</v>

3359
01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:58.310
<v Speaker 4>Premises delivery,</v>

3360
01:34:58.311 --> 01:34:59.540
<v Speaker 4>like what was so special about it?</v>

3361
01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:02.000
<v Speaker 4>He would go in and out of stuff.</v>

3362
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:04.220
<v Speaker 4>He was just crush,</v>

3363
01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:05.840
<v Speaker 4>crush and then he would go,</v>

3364
01:35:06.230 --> 01:35:07.130
<v Speaker 4>what's next?</v>

3365
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:12.680
<v Speaker 4>And he would just wait for somebody in the crowd to say anything and he would</v>

3366
01:35:12.681 --> 01:35:13.041
<v Speaker 4>literally,</v>

3367
01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:14.850
<v Speaker 4>basically he was thunder plussing it.</v>

3368
01:35:15.230 --> 01:35:17.410
<v Speaker 4>He was staying stand up on the spotting it,</v>

3369
01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:22.780
<v Speaker 4>but he has 35 years of bank and confidence and energy and I don't think he's</v>

3370
01:35:26.151 --> 01:35:27.080
<v Speaker 4>always been that way.</v>

3371
01:35:27.081 --> 01:35:30.380
<v Speaker 4>Like I remember how goofy is specials looked when I was kid when I was a kid.</v>

3372
01:35:30.381 --> 01:35:35.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't really remember anything that he talked about really is and that's all I</v>

3373
01:35:35.151 --> 01:35:35.984
<v Speaker 4>can remember.</v>

3374
01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:36.471
<v Speaker 4>Go Ham,</v>

3375
01:35:36.471 --> 01:35:36.801
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

3376
01:35:36.801 --> 01:35:36.911
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3377
01:35:36.911 --> 01:35:37.744
<v Speaker 4>I'm a go.</v>

3378
01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:41.720
<v Speaker 4>But he was on fire man.</v>

3379
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:44.390
<v Speaker 4>Not the type of stuff that I was expecting at all.</v>

3380
01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:46.480
<v Speaker 4>Like what kind of premises do we use?</v>

3381
01:35:46.481 --> 01:35:47.211
<v Speaker 4>Surprise by luck.</v>

3382
01:35:47.211 --> 01:35:49.160
<v Speaker 4>His points or really?</v>

3383
01:35:49.730 --> 01:35:50.563
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3384
01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:51.110
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>

3385
01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:51.943
<v Speaker 4>how long ago was this?</v>

3386
01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:53.600
<v Speaker 4>This was a about a year ago.</v>

3387
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:55.940
<v Speaker 4>You don't hear about them that much anymore?</v>

3388
01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:59.090
<v Speaker 4>That's where we had him on killed Tony a couple months ago.</v>

3389
01:35:59.091 --> 01:36:04.091
<v Speaker 4>Him and Jeff Garlin on the same episode and that was a blast and we got to see</v>

3390
01:36:04.461 --> 01:36:06.050
<v Speaker 4>some of it there too.</v>

3391
01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:08.060
<v Speaker 4>He's great at riffing then.</v>

3392
01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.193
<v Speaker 4>No Shit.</v>

3393
01:36:13.410 --> 01:36:15.530
<v Speaker 4>Just super nice.</v>

3394
01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.150
<v Speaker 4>She tried to say you're in black guys.</v>

3395
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.903
<v Speaker 4>Just Sinbad,</v>

3396
01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:23.230
<v Speaker 4>32 dark posts.</v>

3397
01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:27.010
<v Speaker 4>Only his pants though.</v>

3398
01:36:27.170 --> 01:36:27.891
<v Speaker 4>Those hammer pants.</v>

3399
01:36:27.891 --> 01:36:28.790
<v Speaker 4>If you could bring those back,</v>

3400
01:36:28.791 --> 01:36:31.610
<v Speaker 4>there'll be a strong move cause someone has to be the first person to slap those</v>

3401
01:36:31.611 --> 01:36:32.630
<v Speaker 4>pants on in the first place.</v>

3402
01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:37.550
<v Speaker 4>We're wearing them and silver lake MC hammer pants,</v>

3403
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.863
<v Speaker 4>ironically,</v>

3404
01:36:39.730 --> 01:36:43.330
<v Speaker 4>and they are garland and Sinbad.</v>

3405
01:36:45.210 --> 01:36:45.850
<v Speaker 4>Samsung Hammer.</v>

3406
01:36:45.850 --> 01:36:48.220
<v Speaker 4>I did send that.</v>

3407
01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:50.480
<v Speaker 4>I've never met the gentleman.</v>

3408
01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:51.351
<v Speaker 4>He was really,</v>

3409
01:36:51.351 --> 01:36:52.184
<v Speaker 4>really nice.</v>

3410
01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:53.810
<v Speaker 4>You'd be really surprised.</v>

3411
01:36:54.010 --> 01:36:54.741
<v Speaker 4>I bet he's a nice guy.</v>

3412
01:36:54.741 --> 01:36:55.221
<v Speaker 4>Is Never,</v>

3413
01:36:55.221 --> 01:36:56.340
<v Speaker 4>never heard a bad thing about him.</v>

3414
01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:57.853
<v Speaker 4>Never heard he's a duck.</v>

3415
01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:00.350
<v Speaker 4>This episode with Garland and Sinbad,</v>

3416
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:05.210
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like 35 and 32 years or something crazy that they've both been</v>

3417
01:37:05.211 --> 01:37:05.481
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>

3418
01:37:05.481 --> 01:37:07.010
<v Speaker 4>Standups are the comedians.</v>

3419
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:10.250
<v Speaker 4>I think there was one or two that had their first time ever on stage.</v>

3420
01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:15.020
<v Speaker 4>We're getting immediate feedback from over 60 years of comedy experience.</v>

3421
01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:17.450
<v Speaker 4>70 if you throw in me and Brian,</v>

3422
01:37:17.451 --> 01:37:18.950
<v Speaker 4>but that's crazy.</v>

3423
01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:19.873
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3424
01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:22.470
<v Speaker 4>towels.</v>

3425
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:23.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

3426
01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:23.981
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3427
01:37:23.981 --> 01:37:27.080
<v Speaker 4>that's another funny thing that I'll tell you the only,</v>

3428
01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:28.580
<v Speaker 4>the only thing on his rider,</v>

3429
01:37:28.581 --> 01:37:29.900
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God,</v>

3430
01:37:29.901 --> 01:37:30.531
<v Speaker 4>I got to the,</v>

3431
01:37:30.531 --> 01:37:31.330
<v Speaker 4>I got the,</v>

3432
01:37:31.330 --> 01:37:32.360
<v Speaker 4>in the green room,</v>

3433
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:36.740
<v Speaker 4>there's a little cabinet things sitting there and it just had 10 hand towels on</v>

3434
01:37:36.741 --> 01:37:36.801
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3435
01:37:36.801 --> 01:37:40.190
<v Speaker 4>And there was a note that said for Sinbad and the assistant that brought me</v>

3436
01:37:40.191 --> 01:37:40.500
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

3437
01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:40.701
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

3438
01:37:40.701 --> 01:37:41.390
<v Speaker 4>what's that?</v>

3439
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.931
<v Speaker 4>And she goes,</v>

3440
01:37:41.931 --> 01:37:44.720
<v Speaker 4>that's the only thing on his rider 10 clean hand towels.</v>

3441
01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:45.793
<v Speaker 4>So hilarious.</v>

3442
01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:48.620
<v Speaker 4>Black dudes love towels.</v>

3443
01:37:48.621 --> 01:37:50.340
<v Speaker 4>It's true of to pat the forehead down.</v>

3444
01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:51.560
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3445
01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:54.440
<v Speaker 4>Bill Byrd did that and his latest special I was gonna I was gonna call him up</v>

3446
01:37:54.441 --> 01:37:55.274
<v Speaker 4>and ask him it.</v>

3447
01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 4>He</v>

3448
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:59.250
<v Speaker 5>had his forehead down with a towel yet sitting there and the other thing was</v>

3449
01:37:59.400 --> 01:37:59.970
<v Speaker 5>kind of,</v>

3450
01:37:59.970 --> 01:38:01.770
<v Speaker 5>he had a glass of water.</v>

3451
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:02.760
<v Speaker 5>It was just a glass,</v>

3452
01:38:02.761 --> 01:38:05.100
<v Speaker 5>not a bottle of water with a cap and actual class.</v>

3453
01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:05.670
<v Speaker 5>Like he's,</v>

3454
01:38:05.670 --> 01:38:06.930
<v Speaker 5>he's so old school.</v>

3455
01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:08.970
<v Speaker 5>He had a glass of water on stage.</v>

3456
01:38:08.971 --> 01:38:10.630
<v Speaker 5>Like you could totally see him doing that too.</v>

3457
01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:12.213
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3458
01:38:12.270 --> 01:38:13.440
<v Speaker 5>it probably was tap water,</v>

3459
01:38:13.770 --> 01:38:14.100
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>

3460
01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:15.150
<v Speaker 5>I'll just take it out of the phone.</v>

3461
01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:18.030
<v Speaker 5>These guys now everybody's got a bottle of water.</v>

3462
01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:20.910
<v Speaker 5>Have fucking bottled water.</v>

3463
01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:21.960
<v Speaker 5>I think there's this,</v>

3464
01:38:21.961 --> 01:38:23.250
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a fucking scam.</v>

3465
01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:23.851
<v Speaker 5>That's what I think.</v>

3466
01:38:23.851 --> 01:38:26.310
<v Speaker 5>I think they just take that shit out and they s they sell it to you and they</v>

3467
01:38:26.311 --> 01:38:28.350
<v Speaker 5>look at you like you're a fucking idiot when you pay for it.</v>

3468
01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:30.060
<v Speaker 5>Every time with the cap,</v>

3469
01:38:30.061 --> 01:38:30.400
<v Speaker 5>what I'm doing,</v>

3470
01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:30.751
<v Speaker 5>what am I,</v>

3471
01:38:30.751 --> 01:38:30.931
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

3472
01:38:30.931 --> 01:38:32.550
<v Speaker 5>Why am I putting in time on this job?</v>

3473
01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:33.960
<v Speaker 5>He's got one of those voices,</v>

3474
01:38:33.961 --> 01:38:34.171
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3475
01:38:34.171 --> 01:38:34.411
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3476
01:38:34.411 --> 01:38:38.940
<v Speaker 5>he's a guy that has also benefited tremendously from podcasts because he goes on</v>

3477
01:38:38.941 --> 01:38:40.500
<v Speaker 5>these rifts every week.</v>

3478
01:38:40.501 --> 01:38:42.720
<v Speaker 5>He does his podcast completely by himself,</v>

3479
01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:43.860
<v Speaker 5>which I've done before,</v>

3480
01:38:43.861 --> 01:38:45.000
<v Speaker 5>which is fucking hard,</v>

3481
01:38:45.001 --> 01:38:45.300
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3482
01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:46.380
<v Speaker 5>It's really hard.</v>

3483
01:38:46.590 --> 01:38:51.590
<v Speaker 5>It's hard not to a slide into a being boring,</v>

3484
01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:52.910
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3485
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:53.250
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3486
01:38:53.250 --> 01:38:54.330
<v Speaker 5>The monotonous,</v>

3487
01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:55.590
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to be entertaining,</v>

3488
01:38:55.770 --> 01:38:56.161
<v Speaker 5>but he's,</v>

3489
01:38:56.161 --> 01:38:57.630
<v Speaker 5>he's fucking entertaining doing it.</v>

3490
01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:00.990
<v Speaker 5>And there's something to be said for not having video too.</v>

3491
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:02.790
<v Speaker 5>There's something to be said for video,</v>

3492
01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:04.920
<v Speaker 5>but there's also something to be said for just audio.</v>

3493
01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:09.150
<v Speaker 5>Just audio is a type of entertainment,</v>

3494
01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:09.780
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3495
01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:11.280
<v Speaker 5>like putting it down on youtube,</v>

3496
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:13.260
<v Speaker 5>putting a podcast on Vimeo and all that stuff.</v>

3497
01:39:13.261 --> 01:39:13.920
<v Speaker 5>It's all great.</v>

3498
01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:14.310
<v Speaker 5>Nothing,</v>

3499
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:15.180
<v Speaker 5>nothing bad about it.</v>

3500
01:39:15.181 --> 01:39:19.260
<v Speaker 5>But occasionally I just like listening to shit and burst podcasts the best for</v>

3501
01:39:19.261 --> 01:39:20.730
<v Speaker 5>that because it's just him.</v>

3502
01:39:21.090 --> 01:39:24.820
<v Speaker 5>You could tell it's just him with a couple pieces of paper at his desk and he</v>

3503
01:39:24.821 --> 01:39:25.654
<v Speaker 5>just ran.</v>

3504
01:39:25.770 --> 01:39:26.603
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3505
01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:33.090
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting listening to kill Tony versus watching killed Tony because I</v>

3506
01:39:33.091 --> 01:39:34.560
<v Speaker 5>usually always watch it,</v>

3507
01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:39.680
<v Speaker 5>but lately I've been listening to it and you don't judge who's on stage as much</v>

3508
01:39:39.871 --> 01:39:40.260
<v Speaker 5>when you,</v>

3509
01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:42.960
<v Speaker 5>you're just listening to this open miker talk.</v>

3510
01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:46.470
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it's actually way better to listen to the audio because you're</v>

3511
01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:51.210
<v Speaker 5>actually hearing what he's trying to say like almost as a character instead of</v>

3512
01:39:51.211 --> 01:39:52.140
<v Speaker 5>seeing the video part.</v>

3513
01:39:52.170 --> 01:39:52.470
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3514
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:54.840
<v Speaker 5>it's neat how some podcasts changed.</v>

3515
01:39:54.930 --> 01:39:55.920
<v Speaker 5>Well even comedy,</v>

3516
01:39:55.921 --> 01:39:57.030
<v Speaker 5>I think comedy,</v>

3517
01:39:57.031 --> 01:40:02.031
<v Speaker 5>I love watching it but I also love just lying back like with some headsets on</v>

3518
01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:03.840
<v Speaker 5>closing my eyes,</v>

3519
01:40:03.841 --> 01:40:04.770
<v Speaker 5>listening to a set.</v>

3520
01:40:05.010 --> 01:40:06.240
<v Speaker 5>I like doing that too.</v>

3521
01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:06.781
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3522
01:40:06.781 --> 01:40:07.614
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>

3523
01:40:07.770 --> 01:40:08.011
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3524
01:40:08.011 --> 01:40:10.560
<v Speaker 5>like when I was a kid we used to listen to albums.</v>

3525
01:40:10.770 --> 01:40:11.910
<v Speaker 5>Like that was a big thing.</v>

3526
01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:12.841
<v Speaker 5>Like comedy albums,</v>

3527
01:40:12.841 --> 01:40:14.580
<v Speaker 5>like Cheech and Chong and you know,</v>

3528
01:40:14.581 --> 01:40:19.290
<v Speaker 5>listen to old bill Cosby albums and when we would sit and listen to them,</v>

3529
01:40:19.291 --> 01:40:20.370
<v Speaker 5>I would just be like,</v>

3530
01:40:20.371 --> 01:40:22.770
<v Speaker 5>you'd just be sitting around listening to the words,</v>

3531
01:40:22.771 --> 01:40:24.630
<v Speaker 5>just looking off in the room you were in,</v>

3532
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:25.231
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3533
01:40:25.231 --> 01:40:25.530
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3534
01:40:25.530 --> 01:40:26.100
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3535
01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:27.480
<v Speaker 5>there's something about that,</v>

3536
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:32.510
<v Speaker 5>the allowing your mind to like go on a little dance and not getting any visual</v>

3537
01:40:33.511 --> 01:40:34.200
<v Speaker 5>stimuli.</v>

3538
01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:36.810
<v Speaker 5>You're just sort of it and putting it all together in your mind.</v>

3539
01:40:37.170 --> 01:40:37.891
<v Speaker 5>Some about that.</v>

3540
01:40:37.891 --> 01:40:38.970
<v Speaker 5>That's really fucking cool.</v>

3541
01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:39.680
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3542
01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:40.290
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

3543
01:40:40.290 --> 01:40:44.760
<v Speaker 5>I w I would definitely like if someone had to choose between never seeing people</v>

3544
01:40:44.761 --> 01:40:46.740
<v Speaker 5>again or always seeing people again,</v>

3545
01:40:46.770 --> 01:40:48.570
<v Speaker 5>I would always go with always seeing people again.</v>

3546
01:40:48.810 --> 01:40:51.570
<v Speaker 5>But there's something cool about just comedy cds.</v>

3547
01:40:51.630 --> 01:40:52.463
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3548
01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 5>It's Kinda like when you read a</v>

3549
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:54.700
<v Speaker 3>book and you're,</v>

3550
01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:56.050
<v Speaker 3>and you're thinking about something else and you're like,</v>

3551
01:40:56.051 --> 01:40:58.570
<v Speaker 3>oh I have to go back to the beginning when you watch video and audio cause</v>

3552
01:40:58.571 --> 01:40:59.291
<v Speaker 3>you're focusing,</v>

3553
01:40:59.291 --> 01:40:59.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3554
01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.030
<v Speaker 3>oh that guy's hair's weird.</v>

3555
01:41:01.031 --> 01:41:02.110
<v Speaker 3>Or Why is he wearing that?</v>

3556
01:41:02.530 --> 01:41:04.120
<v Speaker 3>Instead of like you listen to the judge,</v>

3557
01:41:04.121 --> 01:41:04.360
<v Speaker 3>she like,</v>

3558
01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:04.481
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3559
01:41:04.481 --> 01:41:05.470
<v Speaker 3>he's actually funny.</v>

3560
01:41:05.471 --> 01:41:08.650
<v Speaker 3>If I was just listening and not looking at his outfit and how weird he is,</v>

3561
01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:09.790
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

3562

<v Speaker 10>That's it.</v>

3611

<v Speaker 10>That's the nickname he has for me.</v>

3612
01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:34.380
<v Speaker 10>Tony.</v>

<v Speaker 10>Tony's do that all the time.</v>

3614
01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:37.733
<v Speaker 10>Tony.</v>

3615
01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:42.870
<v Speaker 10>That's probably who made the subreddit by the way.</v>

3616
01:42:42.930 --> 01:42:43.741
<v Speaker 10>Oh God.</v>

3617
01:42:43.741 --> 01:42:45.180

3618
01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:45.391

3621
01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:50.240
<v Speaker 1>do you like,</v>

3622
01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:50.961
<v Speaker 1>do you have a plan?</v>

3623
01:42:50.961 --> 01:42:51.141
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

3624
01:42:51.141 --> 01:42:51.470
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

3625
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:52.303
<v Speaker 1>do you have like a,</v>

3626
01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:56.330
<v Speaker 1>like a transition to becoming a professional standup plan?</v>

3627
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:57.490
<v Speaker 1>I said what you guys would love to do.</v>

3628
01:42:57.530 --> 01:42:58.610
<v Speaker 1>You want to do your own podcast?</v>

3629
01:42:58.710 --> 01:42:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3630
01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:00.001
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3631
01:43:00.001 --> 01:43:02.310
<v Speaker 3>I've thought about doing my own podcast for sure.</v>

3632
01:43:02.311 --> 01:43:03.180
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about it.</v>

3633
01:43:03.181 --> 01:43:03.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3634
01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:04.553
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3635
01:43:05.010 --> 01:43:05.341
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3636
01:43:05.341 --> 01:43:08.160
<v Speaker 3>I think that the benefit of killed Tony,</v>

3637
01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:13.050
<v Speaker 3>there's still so much benefit for us because there's so much that we,</v>

3638
01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:15.960
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I've learned in like a small amount of time.</v>

3639
01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Just from being like holding yourself to a standard of writing in this stuff all</v>

3640
01:43:21.751 --> 01:43:24.840
<v Speaker 3>the time and meeting people and getting feedback from people who've been doing</v>

3641
01:43:24.841 --> 01:43:25.674
<v Speaker 3>it longer.</v>

3642
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:26.370
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3643
01:43:26.370 --> 01:43:28.110
<v Speaker 3>you can't ask for that.</v>

3644
01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:29.010
<v Speaker 3>You can't find that.</v>

3645
01:43:29.310 --> 01:43:29.651
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3646
01:43:29.651 --> 01:43:30.484
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

3647
01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:33.750
<v Speaker 1>And you guys ever have a material cross?</v>

3648
01:43:35.230 --> 01:43:36.330

3649
01:43:36.570 --> 01:43:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3650
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:38.070
<v Speaker 1>like current event type shit.</v>

3651
01:43:38.130 --> 01:43:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh you're writing a new minute every week.</v>

3652
01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Her and I are totally different.</v>

3653
01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3654
01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:42.970
<v Speaker 3>Completely different.</v>

3655
01:43:42.971 --> 01:43:44.730
<v Speaker 3>The comedians like,</v>

3656
01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:44.920
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3657
01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:46.540
<v Speaker 3>two completely different styles,</v>

3658
01:43:46.570 --> 01:43:47.710
<v Speaker 3>different voices.</v>

3659
01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Kevin talks a little bit more about topical stuff and her family and Sarah</v>

3660
01:43:51.351 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 3>organically</v>

3661
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:57.100
<v Speaker 4>just ends up talking about like the most random small thing you can imagine.</v>

3662
01:43:57.450 --> 01:44:01.180
<v Speaker 1>You know how like there's like some subjects when you go to an open mic night or</v>

3663
01:44:01.181 --> 01:44:03.760
<v Speaker 1>any sort of a show where guys are working on new material.</v>

3664
01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:04.391
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3665
01:44:04.391 --> 01:44:04.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3666
01:44:04.930 --> 01:44:05.741
<v Speaker 1>remember that one Brian,</v>

3667
01:44:05.741 --> 01:44:07.370
<v Speaker 1>when the Chinese uh,</v>

3668
01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:12.420
<v Speaker 1>pilot crashed into the American pilot and his name was one way and that became</v>

3669
01:44:13.241 --> 01:44:17.050
<v Speaker 1>like the most ridiculously overused joke in the history of comedy.</v>

3670
01:44:17.290 --> 01:44:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody had a joke about this guy named Wong way who's a Chinese fighter</v>

3671
01:44:22.451 --> 01:44:23.260
<v Speaker 1>pilot.</v>

3672
01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has a Tinder joke.</v>

3673
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has a cosmic joke.</v>

3674
01:44:26.770 --> 01:44:27.603
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3675
01:44:27.790 --> 01:44:28.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3676
01:44:28.001 --> 01:44:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Cosby's another perfect example.</v>

3677
01:44:29.441 --> 01:44:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go on an open Mike night today,</v>

3678
01:44:30.851 --> 01:44:34.500
<v Speaker 1>most likely five or six people before you have already told Cosby jokes.</v>

3679
01:44:34.630 --> 01:44:35.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3680
01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:35.430
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3681
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.671
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3682
01:44:35.671 --> 01:44:37.380
<v Speaker 3>Well like it's kind of like you said earlier.</v>

3683
01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:38.303
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3684
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:39.600
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I only,</v>

3685
01:44:39.690 --> 01:44:40.050
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3686
01:44:40.050 --> 01:44:43.620
<v Speaker 3>there's things that people talk about all the time and I know it's going to be</v>

3687
01:44:43.621 --> 01:44:45.660
<v Speaker 3>what everyone's saying at an open mic.</v>

3688
01:44:45.661 --> 01:44:49.230
<v Speaker 3>But if I feel like I have a better joke about it than everybody else and I'll</v>

3689
01:44:49.231 --> 01:44:50.310
<v Speaker 3>absolutely do it,</v>

3690
01:44:50.430 --> 01:44:52.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if everyone else talking about it because if it's better than</v>

3691
01:44:52.951 --> 01:44:53.551
<v Speaker 3>everyone else's,</v>

3692
01:44:53.551 --> 01:44:54.320
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>

3693
01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:54.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3694
01:44:54.531 --> 01:44:55.101
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

3695
01:44:55.101 --> 01:44:55.761
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to,</v>

3696
01:44:55.761 --> 01:44:57.050
<v Speaker 1>just because the subjects are have been,</v>

3697
01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:57.590
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

3698
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:59.330
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're just working on jokes,</v>

3699
01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:00.540
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially what you're doing.</v>

3700
01:45:00.570 --> 01:45:02.870
<v Speaker 1>You're doing sets of new shit every week.</v>

3701
01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:03.470
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

3702
01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:05.900
<v Speaker 1>you're like in a constant state of working on jokes.</v>

3703
01:45:06.010 --> 01:45:06.843
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3704
01:45:07.110 --> 01:45:07.943
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like we've never had close to the same topic.</v>

3706
01:45:11.231 --> 01:45:11.950
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3707
01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:12.783

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3709
01:45:13.710 --> 01:45:16.030
<v Speaker 3>Sarah pick something and then she focuses on it.</v>

3710
01:45:16.031 --> 01:45:16.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3715
01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:23.820
<v Speaker 4>Mayonnaise.</v>

3716
01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:24.773
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3717
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:26.400

3718
01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:26.591
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

01:45:26.591 --> 01:45:27.420
<v Speaker 4>Break it down.</v>

3720
01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:28.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3721
01:45:28.170 --> 01:45:28.680
<v Speaker 4>Crack.</v>

3722
01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:29.860
<v Speaker 4>That's how she's a third slot.</v>

3723
01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:30.490
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

3724
01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:31.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:33.450
<v Speaker 4>Easter baskets.</v>

3726
01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:35.460
<v Speaker 4>Let's talk about them and I hate him.</v>

3727
01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:37.080
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it's tougher</v>

3728
01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:39.230
<v Speaker 1>to be a check and do standup comedy?</v>

3729
01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:39.961
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

3730
01:45:39.961 --> 01:45:41.100
<v Speaker 3>I like this question.</v>

3731
01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:42.480
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

3732
01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:44.280
<v Speaker 3>I think there's two different advantages.</v>

3733
01:45:44.281 --> 01:45:45.120
<v Speaker 3>Like think that,</v>

3734
01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:46.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3735
01:45:46.230 --> 01:45:47.130
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's like,</v>

3736
01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:47.730
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3737
01:45:47.730 --> 01:45:51.300
<v Speaker 3>they only get this stuff because they're girls or you know,</v>

3738
01:45:51.301 --> 01:45:51.620
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3739
01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:51.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3740
01:45:51.991 --> 01:45:52.710
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3741
01:45:52.710 --> 01:45:56.050
<v Speaker 3>they flirt their way to stage time or whatever and then at the same time they're</v>

3742
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.400
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3743
01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:58.110
<v Speaker 3>not that many girls.</v>

3744
01:45:58.350 --> 01:45:59.183
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3745
01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:01.200
<v Speaker 3>Sarah and I started killed Tony because it was,</v>

3746
01:46:01.201 --> 01:46:05.430
<v Speaker 3>you said it was all guy comedians in the beginning and then we became to regular</v>

3747
01:46:05.431 --> 01:46:06.540
<v Speaker 3>girls at the end of it.</v>

3748
01:46:06.541 --> 01:46:07.374
<v Speaker 3>And it's just,</v>

3749
01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:10.350
<v Speaker 3>there's not that much competition right now.</v>

3750
01:46:10.351 --> 01:46:11.101
<v Speaker 3>Especially right now.</v>

3751
01:46:11.101 --> 01:46:14.040
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's not a lot of girls in New York.</v>

3752
01:46:14.041 --> 01:46:15.210
<v Speaker 3>I know there's a lot more girls,</v>

3753
01:46:15.211 --> 01:46:17.930
<v Speaker 3>but I think that it gives us an advantage and like,</v>

3754
01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:19.440
<v Speaker 3>I think that if you're funny,</v>

3755
01:46:19.441 --> 01:46:20.250
<v Speaker 3>you're funny.</v>

3756
01:46:20.250 --> 01:46:20.851
<v Speaker 3>If you work hard,</v>

3757
01:46:20.851 --> 01:46:21.660
<v Speaker 3>you work hard.</v>

3758
01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3759
01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Those are two definite truth.</v>

3760
01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:23.811
<v Speaker 1>If you're funny,</v>

3761
01:46:23.811 --> 01:46:24.120
<v Speaker 1>you're funny.</v>

3762
01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:24.631
<v Speaker 1>If you work hard,</v>

3763
01:46:24.631 --> 01:46:25.410
<v Speaker 1>you work hard,</v>

3764
01:46:25.410 --> 01:46:26.243
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

3765
01:46:26.290 --> 01:46:28.710
<v Speaker 1>But I think that what I've always thought was that,</v>

3766
01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:29.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3767
01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:33.630
<v Speaker 1>we're lucky as men that we could get away with a lot more subject matter.</v>

3768
01:46:33.870 --> 01:46:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Like a man can talk about politics and critique like,</v>

3769
01:46:37.650 --> 01:46:39.060
<v Speaker 1>like what's going on in the world.</v>

3770
01:46:39.390 --> 01:46:41.310
<v Speaker 1>But I think if women start doing that,</v>

3771
01:46:41.311 --> 01:46:41.611
<v Speaker 1>like men,</v>

3772
01:46:41.611 --> 01:46:43.230
<v Speaker 1>unless they're like really established,</v>

3773
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:43.851
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

3774
01:46:43.851 --> 01:46:45.900
<v Speaker 1>unless you're like someone that you come to see you do that,</v>

3775
01:46:45.901 --> 01:46:50.670
<v Speaker 1>like maybe Janine Garafalo or someone that you go to expect that if an unknown</v>

3776
01:46:50.730 --> 01:46:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Gow is on stage and she starts criticizing the current administration,</v>

3777
01:46:54.661 --> 01:46:56.220
<v Speaker 1>like who's this fucking know it all bitch,</v>

3778
01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:57.353
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3779
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3780
01:46:58.270 --> 01:46:58.501
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3781
01:46:58.501 --> 01:46:59.970
<v Speaker 1>And then like guys,</v>

3782
01:46:59.971 --> 01:47:04.020
<v Speaker 1>a lot of guys do not like hearing women like in position of speaking if they</v>

3783
01:47:04.021 --> 01:47:05.130
<v Speaker 1>have differing opinions.</v>

3784
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:06.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3785
01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:07.770
<v Speaker 1>like during like there's a lot of people,</v>

3786
01:47:07.771 --> 01:47:08.520
<v Speaker 1>especially men,</v>

3787
01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:13.520
<v Speaker 1>they're in this constant state of like a conflict and competition at work.</v>

3788
01:47:14.370 --> 01:47:15.450
<v Speaker 1>They're constantly at work,</v>

3789
01:47:15.490 --> 01:47:15.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3790
01:47:15.691 --> 01:47:17.180
<v Speaker 1>battling back and forth with their boss,</v>

3791
01:47:17.210 --> 01:47:18.510
<v Speaker 1>dealing with the clients and this and that,</v>

3792
01:47:18.690 --> 01:47:19.890
<v Speaker 1>and they're in this constant state.</v>

3793
01:47:20.010 --> 01:47:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Then they go to a comedy club and some chick has onstage and she's talking about</v>

3794
01:47:22.981 --> 01:47:23.290
<v Speaker 1>the depth,</v>

3795
01:47:23.290 --> 01:47:24.540
<v Speaker 1>the difference between the Republicans,</v>

3796
01:47:24.541 --> 01:47:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Democrats,</v>

3797
01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:27.480
<v Speaker 1>you don't know shit about real public.</v>

3798
01:47:28.170 --> 01:47:28.921
<v Speaker 1>Let me guess.</v>

3799
01:47:28.921 --> 01:47:30.180
<v Speaker 1>You fucking lived hard,</v>

3800
01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:30.751
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

3801
01:47:30.751 --> 01:47:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Like they're in this constant state and a woman going on stage.</v>

3802
01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:34.981
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>

3803
01:47:34.981 --> 01:47:39.981
<v Speaker 1>it's an extra little hill to climb and then sex is also what I would think is an</v>

3804
01:47:40.681 --> 01:47:45.030
<v Speaker 1>extra little hill to climb because it dude can talk about just and all over the</v>

3805
01:47:45.031 --> 01:47:46.050
<v Speaker 1>place or you know,</v>

3806
01:47:46.051 --> 01:47:47.490
<v Speaker 1>you can talk about basically anything,</v>

3807
01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:47.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3808
01:47:47.790 --> 01:47:49.590
<v Speaker 1>But a girl talking about sex,</v>

3809
01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:51.060
<v Speaker 1>it gets really tricky.</v>

3810
01:47:51.061 --> 01:47:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Like girls a clam up,</v>

3811
01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:52.620
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

3812
01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:53.700
<v Speaker 1>they'll think you're a whore.</v>

3813
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:54.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3814
01:47:54.450 --> 01:47:55.220
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

3815
01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:55.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3816
01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:58.080
<v Speaker 1>don't know when you know they should laugh or what,</v>

3817
01:47:58.081 --> 01:47:59.350
<v Speaker 1>what's acceptable at a chicken.</v>

3818
01:47:59.370 --> 01:48:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Get Away with talking about.</v>

3819
01:48:00.730 --> 01:48:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3820
01:48:01.050 --> 01:48:04.740
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of trouble with that when I first started because everyone tells you</v>

3821
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:07.920
<v Speaker 3>to talk about your life and I'm 24,</v>

3822
01:48:07.921 --> 01:48:10.350
<v Speaker 3>like I'm having sex and like doing this,</v>

3823
01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:10.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3824
01:48:10.801 --> 01:48:11.161
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3825
01:48:11.161 --> 01:48:12.180
<v Speaker 3>that's my life right now.</v>

3826
01:48:12.181 --> 01:48:12.601
<v Speaker 3>And people are like,</v>

3827
01:48:12.601 --> 01:48:12.691
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3828
01:48:12.691 --> 01:48:15.750
<v Speaker 3>don't talk about having sex because that's hacky.</v>

3829
01:48:15.751 --> 01:48:16.830
<v Speaker 3>That's what all girls talk about.</v>

3830
01:48:16.831 --> 01:48:17.520
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

3831
01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:18.810
<v Speaker 3>that's cause we're having sex.</v>

3832
01:48:18.811 --> 01:48:19.141
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3833
01:48:19.141 --> 01:48:21.330
<v Speaker 3>like you're talking about things you're doing.</v>

3834
01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:22.733
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3835
01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:24.180
<v Speaker 3>I just say whatever I want.</v>

3836
01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:25.290
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

3837
01:48:25.290 --> 01:48:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3838
01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:26.493
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

3839
01:48:26.670 --> 01:48:27.391
<v Speaker 3>I don't really care.</v>

3840
01:48:27.391 --> 01:48:27.691
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3841
01:48:27.691 --> 01:48:28.620
<v Speaker 3>my goal is just like,</v>

3842
01:48:28.710 --> 01:48:31.080
<v Speaker 3>I feel like as long as I come out of it funny,</v>

3843
01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:31.891
<v Speaker 3>if you come out,</v>

3844
01:48:31.891 --> 01:48:33.650
<v Speaker 3>if you come out of your set and it was a funny set,</v>

3845
01:48:33.670 --> 01:48:34.740
<v Speaker 3>no one's going to be mad at you.</v>

3846
01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:35.911
<v Speaker 3>So if he was funny,</v>

3847
01:48:35.911 --> 01:48:36.421
<v Speaker 3>they can't be like,</v>

3848
01:48:36.421 --> 01:48:36.631
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3849
01:48:36.631 --> 01:48:38.100
<v Speaker 3>stupid funny girl.</v>

3850
01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:39.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean they can,</v>

3851
01:48:39.811 --> 01:48:40.644
<v Speaker 3>but then,</v>

3852
01:48:40.810 --> 01:48:41.710
<v Speaker 1>and it's obviously,</v>

3853
01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:46.480
<v Speaker 1>it's obvious if you see like Whitney Cummings or Chelsea handler or you know,</v>

3854
01:48:46.630 --> 01:48:47.590
<v Speaker 1>even Joan Rivers,</v>

3855
01:48:47.591 --> 01:48:50.290
<v Speaker 1>like you could talk about whatever the fuck you want to talk about.</v>

3856
01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:50.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3857
01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:51.221
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3858
01:48:51.221 --> 01:48:52.600
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt like as a woman,</v>

3859
01:48:52.601 --> 01:48:54.610
<v Speaker 1>like it's probably like there's an extra little hump to crop.</v>

3860
01:48:54.690 --> 01:48:54.851
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3861
01:48:54.851 --> 01:48:55.684
<v Speaker 1>they're definitely</v>

3862
01:48:55.790 --> 01:49:00.790
<v Speaker 4>feel like ladies are definitely adi ladies in the audience are tougher on women</v>

3863
01:49:01.371 --> 01:49:03.410
<v Speaker 4>than they are on guys for sure.</v>

3864
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:05.620
<v Speaker 4>Because almost all you can adjust,</v>

3865
01:49:05.670 --> 01:49:07.070
<v Speaker 4>almost see it on their faces.</v>

3866
01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:08.960
<v Speaker 4>That's another funny thing about kill Tony,</v>

3867
01:49:08.961 --> 01:49:13.430
<v Speaker 4>is we have that perspective where you're sitting at a table facing the audience</v>

3868
01:49:13.431 --> 01:49:15.710
<v Speaker 4>and you get to see what they're looking at for a change.</v>

3869
01:49:15.711 --> 01:49:17.990
<v Speaker 4>Like instead of just when you're on stage,</v>

3870
01:49:17.991 --> 01:49:19.850
<v Speaker 4>that camera one perspective,</v>

3871
01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:24.190
<v Speaker 4>you see the looks on their faces sometimes when this type of person's honor,</v>

3872
01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:25.760
<v Speaker 4>that type of persons on and women,</v>

3873
01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:28.070
<v Speaker 4>it seems like all of them were like,</v>

3874
01:49:28.071 --> 01:49:28.904
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3875
01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:31.340
<v Speaker 4>I know I have to be better than her,</v>

3876
01:49:31.341 --> 01:49:33.050
<v Speaker 4>so let's see what she can do.</v>

3877
01:49:33.110 --> 01:49:36.570
<v Speaker 4>And then you watch them get beat out of them after a few seconds.</v>

3878
01:49:36.571 --> 01:49:36.880
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3879
01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:37.180
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3880
01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:37.520
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

3881
01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:37.821
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

3882
01:49:37.821 --> 01:49:38.361
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

3883
01:49:38.361 --> 01:49:40.880
<v Speaker 4>She's a pro and I don't,</v>

3884
01:49:41.150 --> 01:49:42.710
<v Speaker 4>and I judged too quick.</v>

3885
01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:45.600
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some women that just are fans of other women.</v>

3886
01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:46.553
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

3887
01:49:46.710 --> 01:49:49.090
<v Speaker 1>There's some that you love them.</v>

3888
01:49:49.190 --> 01:49:50.050
<v Speaker 1>I love women.</v>

3889
01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:50.351
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3890
01:49:50.351 --> 01:49:50.930
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3891
01:49:50.930 --> 01:49:51.461
<v Speaker 1>Are you met?</v>

3892
01:49:51.461 --> 01:49:53.020
<v Speaker 1>You love the women that don't love women?</v>

3893
01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:54.191
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3894
01:49:54.191 --> 01:49:56.110
<v Speaker 1>like there's some women that only have like male friends.</v>

3895
01:49:56.170 --> 01:49:57.550
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any women friends.</v>

3896
01:49:58.030 --> 01:49:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Those are the crazy ones.</v>

3897
01:49:59.770 --> 01:50:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Are they as crazy as that dude's only have girlfriends?</v>

3898
01:50:05.650 --> 01:50:06.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3906
01:50:14.651 --> 01:50:15.640
<v Speaker 1>He's got a kid.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That dude is gay.</v>

3914
01:50:21.710 --> 01:50:24.850
<v Speaker 1>It turns out in his forties that dude is gay.</v>

3915
01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:26.520
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can't carry this anymore.</v>

3918
01:50:28.650 --> 01:50:29.680
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3919
01:50:29.681 --> 01:50:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I told Joe,</v>

3920
01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

3921
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

3922
01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:34.850
<v Speaker 1>did he start talking gay media?</v>

3923
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:35.441
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

3924
01:50:35.441 --> 01:50:36.161
<v Speaker 1>you know what it was,</v>

3925
01:50:36.161 --> 01:50:36.521
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3926
01:50:36.521 --> 01:50:37.030
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3927
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.751
<v Speaker 1>there was like,</v>

3928
01:50:37.751 --> 01:50:41.860
<v Speaker 1>he was like way too into talking about like girl stuff.</v>

3929
01:50:42.250 --> 01:50:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Like he was way too into talking about like shopping and gossip and I was</v>

3930
01:50:46.871 --> 01:50:47.710
<v Speaker 1>listening to him talk.</v>

3931
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:48.041
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3932
01:50:48.041 --> 01:50:49.290
<v Speaker 1>what is going on here?</v>

3933
01:50:50.170 --> 01:50:51.610
<v Speaker 1>What is this like?</v>

3934
01:50:51.611 --> 01:50:54.040
<v Speaker 1>There was this extreme lack of,</v>

3935
01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:55.173
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

3936
01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:56.013
<v Speaker 1>I mean it wasn't,</v>

3937
01:50:56.470 --> 01:51:01.090
<v Speaker 1>it was more like he was like all male woman than it was that he was homosexual</v>

3938
01:51:01.091 --> 01:51:02.980
<v Speaker 1>because I never felt like he was hitting on me.</v>

3939
01:51:03.370 --> 01:51:04.360
<v Speaker 1>He's a power bottom.</v>

3940
01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a problem to bottom that fuck it back.</v>

3941
01:51:07.570 --> 01:51:12.570
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not saying you never showed any like sexual attraction to men.</v>

3942
01:51:13.690 --> 01:51:17.890
<v Speaker 1>He just showed such feminine behavior patterns that I was like,</v>

3943
01:51:17.891 --> 01:51:18.670
<v Speaker 1>this is wrong,</v>

3944
01:51:18.670 --> 01:51:20.380
<v Speaker 1>this is incorrect here.</v>

3945
01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Like what's going on?</v>

3946
01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:23.453
<v Speaker 1>What's she playing?</v>

3947
01:51:24.030 --> 01:51:26.050
<v Speaker 1>They soon split up.</v>

3948
01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:26.750
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>

3949
01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:27.583
<v Speaker 1>Then</v>

3950
01:51:28.590 --> 01:51:30.010
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing was a disaster.</v>

3951
01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:31.271
<v Speaker 1>But it's just,</v>

3952
01:51:31.271 --> 01:51:32.050
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

3953
01:51:32.050 --> 01:51:32.351
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3954
01:51:32.351 --> 01:51:34.120
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating to see someone like that.</v>

3955
01:51:34.150 --> 01:51:35.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like battling it,</v>

3956
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:37.143
<v Speaker 1>fighting it off.</v>

3957
01:51:37.340 --> 01:51:40.120
<v Speaker 1>The poor bastard just gave in and it's 40.</v>

3958
01:51:40.121 --> 01:51:40.954
<v Speaker 1>It's just</v>

3959
01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:44.230
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

3960
01:51:44.230 --> 01:51:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Not like a 20 year old boyfriend bowing</v>

3961
01:51:50.250 --> 01:51:52.990
<v Speaker 1>out of the closet and into the funnier</v>

3962
01:51:54.630 --> 01:51:56.320
<v Speaker 8>he's flaming get it.</v>

3963
01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:58.150
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3964
01:51:58.150 --> 01:51:59.860
<v Speaker 8>I was hanging out with mostly women,</v>

3965
01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:01.590
<v Speaker 8>but I think it's mostly due to my,</v>

3966
01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:04.000
<v Speaker 8>like growing up with my mom and my sister though.</v>

3967
01:52:04.130 --> 01:52:04.631
<v Speaker 8>But you know,</v>

3968
01:52:04.631 --> 01:52:05.920
<v Speaker 8>a lot of dudes are friends with.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3970
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.610
<v Speaker 8>But,</v>

3971
01:52:06.610 --> 01:52:07.900
<v Speaker 8>but in general,</v>

3972
01:52:07.901 --> 01:52:10.060
<v Speaker 8>I like in high school only had girlfriends,</v>

4025
01:53:23.260 --> 01:53:24.093
<v Speaker 10>That they don't,</v>

4026
01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:28.293
<v Speaker 10>I think</v>

4027
01:53:31.420 --> 01:53:32.720
<v Speaker 10>they look a lot alike.</v>

4028
01:53:32.830 --> 01:53:33.220
<v Speaker 10>Some of,</v>

4029

01:53:35.230 --> 01:53:35.920
<v Speaker 10>yes.</v>

4033
01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:36.191
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

4034
01:53:36.191 --> 01:53:37.720
<v Speaker 10>White people just look very different.</v>

4035
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:40.280
<v Speaker 10>All white people are all like different facial features.</v>

4036
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.960
<v Speaker 10>Rude as fuck.</v>

4037
01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:41.290
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

4038
01:53:41.290 --> 01:53:42.123
<v Speaker 10>that's not rude.</v>

4039
01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

4040
01:53:44.130 --> 01:53:44.780
<v Speaker 1>People are so,</v>

4041
01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:45.560
<v Speaker 1>they all look the same.</v>

4042
01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I get them confused all the time.</v>

4043
01:53:47.150 --> 01:53:47.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4044
01:53:48.290 --> 01:53:49.700
<v Speaker 10>And why people are so different.</v>

4045
01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:51.020
<v Speaker 10>Asians look the same.</v>

4046
01:53:51.050 --> 01:53:56.050
<v Speaker 10>Puerto Rican women a lot of times with the same whoa will never work in this</v>

4047
01:53:56.931 --> 01:53:57.620
<v Speaker 10>town again.</v>

4048
01:53:57.620 --> 01:53:58.310
<v Speaker 10>Wow.</v>

4049
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:59.110
<v Speaker 10>How dare you.</v>

4050
01:53:59.110 --> 01:53:59.960
<v Speaker 10>Not Racist at all.</v>

4051
01:53:59.961 --> 01:54:02.320
<v Speaker 10>I'm just saying like I feel like smell the same way.</v>

4052
01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:06.140
<v Speaker 10>I'm just saying like white people are the only ones that look really,</v>

4053
01:54:06.141 --> 01:54:08.180
<v Speaker 10>really different all the time.</v>

4054
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:09.830
<v Speaker 10>You don't agree with that?</v>

4055
01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:10.820
<v Speaker 10>No.</v>

4056
01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:11.510
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>

4057
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:12.860
<v Speaker 10>maybe I haven't seen enough people.</v>

4058
01:54:14.450 --> 01:54:19.070
<v Speaker 10>You're only 24 kid when you accumulate a database like we have and you want to</v>

4059
01:54:19.071 --> 01:54:20.840
<v Speaker 10>see black people with the lights off anyways.</v>

4060
01:54:20.930 --> 01:54:21.351
<v Speaker 10>Anyways,</v>

4061
01:54:21.351 --> 01:54:22.670
<v Speaker 10>I don't think it's him in the video.</v>

4062
01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:24.500
<v Speaker 10>And I think people are just looking for stuff in,</v>

4063
01:54:24.501 --> 01:54:27.290
<v Speaker 10>regardless if he wasn't mugging an old man,</v>

4064
01:54:27.590 --> 01:54:29.270
<v Speaker 10>the video starts in the middle of a fight.</v>

4065
01:54:29.271 --> 01:54:30.470
<v Speaker 10>So you don't know what happens,</v>

4066
01:54:30.471 --> 01:54:30.770
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

4067
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:31.550
<v Speaker 10>So people are just like,</v>

4068
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.701
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>

4069
01:54:31.701 --> 01:54:32.960
<v Speaker 10>he's just beating up this old dude.</v>

4070
01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:34.100
<v Speaker 10>And it doesn't matter.</v>

4071
01:54:34.101 --> 01:54:37.100
<v Speaker 10>It doesn't mean you can kill someone on a sidewalk for selling cigarettes no</v>

4072
01:54:37.101 --> 01:54:38.230
<v Speaker 10>matter what they used to do.</v>

4073
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:40.540
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm most fascinated by with this?</v>

4074
01:54:40.930 --> 01:54:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Not even just that it's a,</v>

4075
01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:47.590
<v Speaker 1>it seems like weird still stuck when it comes to race relations.</v>

4076
01:54:47.591 --> 01:54:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Like we're still stuck in this US versus them mentality.</v>

4077
01:54:51.041 --> 01:54:54.000
<v Speaker 1>That just hasn't gone away that</v>

4078
01:54:55.590 --> 01:54:56.530
<v Speaker 1>that shocks me.</v>

4079
01:54:56.531 --> 01:55:01.531
<v Speaker 1>But what really shocks me is that they just pick this one event and this one</v>

4080
01:55:01.571 --> 01:55:06.400
<v Speaker 1>event all of a sudden caught fire and became giant because there's so many of</v>

4081
01:55:06.401 --> 01:55:06.790
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

4082
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:08.350
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the numbers of people,</v>

4083
01:55:08.351 --> 01:55:09.010
<v Speaker 1>like there's a,</v>

4084
01:55:09.010 --> 01:55:13.000
<v Speaker 1>there's a website that tracks the numbers of people killed by cops every year.</v>

4085
01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:13.930
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

4086
01:55:13.930 --> 01:55:16.240
<v Speaker 1>like I think it's called cop killer.</v>

4087
01:55:16.270 --> 01:55:16.541
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

4088
01:55:16.541 --> 01:55:17.374
<v Speaker 1>Something or another.</v>

4089
01:55:17.530 --> 01:55:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Somebody tweeted to me today and I was like,</v>

4090
01:55:19.061 --> 01:55:19.894
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

4091
01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:20.341
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

4092
01:55:20.341 --> 01:55:24.400
<v Speaker 1>you look at it like there's like the fact that one just caught on and took off.</v>

4093
01:55:24.430 --> 01:55:25.210
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

4094
01:55:25.210 --> 01:55:25.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4095
01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:26.860
<v Speaker 1>But that happens.</v>

4096
01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:27.401
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>

4097
01:55:27.401 --> 01:55:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Like one thing like makes its way to the forefront and then the public grabs a</v>

4098
01:55:31.841 --> 01:55:35.010
<v Speaker 1>hold of it and then next thing you know they're out in the street and then for</v>

4099
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.741
<v Speaker 1>it to happen.</v>

4100
01:55:35.741 --> 01:55:38.320
<v Speaker 1>And then right after that Eric Gardner case happened.</v>

4101
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.771
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4102
01:55:38.771 --> 01:55:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4103
01:55:39.310 --> 01:55:40.660
<v Speaker 1>it's just like out of control.</v>

4104
01:55:41.170 --> 01:55:41.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4105
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:42.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a tsunami.</v>

4106
01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the hashtags</v>

4107
01:55:44.490 --> 01:55:45.750
<v Speaker 3>after that whole thing happened?</v>

4108
01:55:45.751 --> 01:55:46.620
<v Speaker 3>The climbing wall,</v>

4109
01:55:46.621 --> 01:55:48.750
<v Speaker 3>white and living while Black Hashtags,</v>

4110
01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:50.033
<v Speaker 3>they're insane.</v>

4111
01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:54.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a bunch of white people hashtagging crying while white and admitting to</v>

4112
01:55:54.691 --> 01:55:55.620
<v Speaker 3>crimes they've done that.</v>

4113
01:55:55.621 --> 01:55:56.100
<v Speaker 3>The police,</v>

4114
01:55:56.100 --> 01:56:00.510
<v Speaker 3>like I got pulled over drunk with a gun in my car and the police gave me a ride</v>

4115
01:56:00.511 --> 01:56:01.140
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>

4116
01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:03.540
<v Speaker 3>And it's like all these things that they're admitting and then the living wall,</v>

4117
01:56:03.541 --> 01:56:06.810
<v Speaker 3>black ones were all black people were like,</v>

4118
01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:09.030
<v Speaker 3>I went into a store and got questioned.</v>

4119
01:56:09.230 --> 01:56:09.630
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4120
01:56:09.630 --> 01:56:11.200
<v Speaker 3>And it was like just the difference between,</v>

4121
01:56:11.201 --> 01:56:12.034
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty interesting.</v>

4122
01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:14.810
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely seen a lot of those living wall black,</v>

4123
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:16.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4124
01:56:16.610 --> 01:56:16.851
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4125
01:56:16.851 --> 01:56:18.740
<v Speaker 1>I could see a lot of different sides to this.</v>

4126
01:56:19.130 --> 01:56:24.130
<v Speaker 1>The bottom line of all of it is we have to at a certain point in time realize he</v>

4127
01:56:24.141 --> 01:56:28.580
<v Speaker 1>can't just keep like letting these poor people in these shit neighborhoods keep</v>

4128
01:56:28.581 --> 01:56:31.070
<v Speaker 1>growing up in these neighborhoods and not try to help out.</v>

4129
01:56:31.130 --> 01:56:31.341
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4130
01:56:31.341 --> 01:56:32.630
<v Speaker 1>And I try to fix that spot.</v>

4131
01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:36.080
<v Speaker 1>There's those spots that we have in our country that are like really</v>

4132
01:56:36.081 --> 01:56:36.741
<v Speaker 1>impoverished.</v>

4133
01:56:36.741 --> 01:56:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Those are critical like errors in our system and we're just sort of like letting</v>

4134
01:56:41.121 --> 01:56:41.810
<v Speaker 1>them percolate.</v>

4135
01:56:41.810 --> 01:56:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

4136
01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Less jail is more education I think.</v>

4137
01:56:45.230 --> 01:56:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Fuckable it's also like you could create a bunch of Nice people instead of like</v>

4138
01:56:48.351 --> 01:56:49.131
<v Speaker 1>having people grow up,</v>

4139
01:56:49.131 --> 01:56:50.540
<v Speaker 1>disenfranchise and fucked up.</v>

4140
01:56:50.541 --> 01:56:52.580
<v Speaker 1>You'd have people grow up to contribute to society,</v>

4141
01:56:52.581 --> 01:56:56.030
<v Speaker 1>but everyone's got this me or US versus them or you know,</v>

4142
01:56:56.031 --> 01:56:57.590
<v Speaker 1>all for one and you know,</v>

4143
01:56:57.591 --> 01:56:57.710
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4144
01:56:57.710 --> 01:56:58.543
<v Speaker 1>we don't have this,</v>

4145
01:56:58.670 --> 01:57:01.470
<v Speaker 1>this idea of treating the human race was like,</v>

4146
01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.410
<v Speaker 1>like a cola.</v>

4147
01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:03.550
<v Speaker 1>If we treat treated,</v>

4148
01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:05.240
<v Speaker 1>the human race is like an organism,</v>

4149
01:57:05.450 --> 01:57:06.890
<v Speaker 1>like one collective Oregon,</v>

4150
01:57:06.891 --> 01:57:07.401
<v Speaker 1>a team,</v>

4151
01:57:07.401 --> 01:57:07.761
<v Speaker 1>you would say,</v>

4152
01:57:07.761 --> 01:57:07.941
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4153
01:57:07.941 --> 01:57:08.870
<v Speaker 1>well we've got an issue here.</v>

4154
01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Let's just clean up this issue and figure out a way to manage everything</v>

4155
01:57:12.651 --> 01:57:13.071
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

4156
01:57:13.071 --> 01:57:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Treat it as like one super organism.</v>

4157
01:57:15.651 --> 01:57:16.401
<v Speaker 1>That's our country.</v>

4158
01:57:16.401 --> 01:57:16.890
<v Speaker 1>One job.</v>

4159
01:57:16.890 --> 01:57:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Instead of thinking of it as just a bunch of people living together on a patch</v>

4160
01:57:19.611 --> 01:57:20.150
<v Speaker 1>of dirt,</v>

4161
01:57:20.150 --> 01:57:21.380
<v Speaker 1>let's think of the human beings.</v>

4162
01:57:21.381 --> 01:57:21.681
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4163
01:57:21.681 --> 01:57:21.861
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4164
01:57:21.861 --> 01:57:25.940
<v Speaker 1>we can't separate from each other unless you're a Weirdo hermit type dude.</v>

4165
01:57:25.941 --> 01:57:27.260
<v Speaker 1>This wants to live in the woods.</v>

4166
01:57:27.261 --> 01:57:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's around everybody.</v>

4167
01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:29.060
<v Speaker 1>We're all,</v>

4168
01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:30.260
<v Speaker 1>we all feed off of each other.</v>

4169
01:57:30.261 --> 01:57:31.130
<v Speaker 1>We interact with each other.</v>

4170
01:57:31.131 --> 01:57:32.150
<v Speaker 1>We exchange goods,</v>

4171
01:57:32.151 --> 01:57:33.440
<v Speaker 1>we exchange services.</v>

4172
01:57:33.670 --> 01:57:34.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean we need each other.</v>

4173
01:57:34.401 --> 01:57:35.540
<v Speaker 1>We're a part of a team,</v>

4174
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:36.680
<v Speaker 1>whether we like it or not,</v>

4175
01:57:36.681 --> 01:57:37.431
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

4176
01:57:37.431 --> 01:57:40.160
<v Speaker 1>everybody we were around is a part of our community.</v>

4177
01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:42.530
<v Speaker 1>So I think some one,</v>

4178
01:57:42.531 --> 01:57:45.800
<v Speaker 1>one of these presidents somewhere along the line is going to have to figure out</v>

4179
01:57:45.801 --> 01:57:46.670
<v Speaker 1>a way to,</v>

4180
01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:50.660
<v Speaker 1>to say that in a way on television where people listening go,</v>

4181
01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:51.500
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

4182
01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:52.340
<v Speaker 1>So instead of saying,</v>

4183
01:57:52.341 --> 01:57:52.521
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4184
01:57:52.521 --> 01:57:55.450
<v Speaker 1>these welfare moms try to give all these fucking welfare model,</v>

4185
01:57:55.451 --> 01:57:55.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4186
01:57:55.610 --> 01:57:56.690
<v Speaker 1>every baby they have,</v>

4187
01:57:56.691 --> 01:57:57.530
<v Speaker 1>they get another check.</v>

4188
01:57:57.531 --> 01:57:58.364
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4189
01:57:58.430 --> 01:57:59.060
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4190
01:57:59.060 --> 01:57:59.341
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4191
01:57:59.341 --> 01:57:59.460
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

4192
01:57:59.460 --> 01:57:59.780
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>

4193
01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:00.860
<v Speaker 1>this is the least of our worries.</v>

4194
01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4195
01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:02.960
<v Speaker 1>The big worry is this,</v>

4196
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:05.810
<v Speaker 1>more or less people are growing up in this crime ridden neighborhoods and then</v>

4197
01:58:05.811 --> 01:58:09.350
<v Speaker 1>they're just growing up and becoming adults and then they go out into the world</v>

4198
01:58:09.351 --> 01:58:09.681
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

4199
01:58:09.681 --> 01:58:11.810
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a bunch of human problems.</v>

4200
01:58:11.950 --> 01:58:12.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4201
01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:14.320
<v Speaker 4>The worst is really the prison system.</v>

4202
01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:14.771
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

4203
01:58:14.771 --> 01:58:15.191
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4204
01:58:15.191 --> 01:58:15.530
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

4205
01:58:15.530 --> 01:58:19.570
<v Speaker 4>It's the worst of the worst of the worst of our problems because I bet I've been</v>

4206
01:58:19.571 --> 01:58:22.720
<v Speaker 4>working on something recently that us to do with presence and uh,</v>

4207
01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:24.160
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

4208
01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:29.160
<v Speaker 4>so I found out about how the rest of the world does it and how they completely</v>

4209
01:58:29.801 --> 01:58:33.340
<v Speaker 4>can rehabilitate people and get them back in society.</v>

4210
01:58:33.341 --> 01:58:36.870
<v Speaker 4>And it's totally the opposite here where the,</v>

4211
01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:40.840
<v Speaker 4>you basically create a worse criminal by sending them to prison and then you</v>

4212
01:58:40.841 --> 01:58:43.510
<v Speaker 4>send back out again and they have no idea what to do.</v>

4213
01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:44.331
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>

4214
01:58:44.331 --> 01:58:46.310
<v Speaker 5>they make money off putting him in prison,</v>

4215
01:58:46.311 --> 01:58:48.020
<v Speaker 5>which is the most insane thing ever.</v>

4216
01:58:48.021 --> 01:58:48.331
<v Speaker 5>This is a,</v>

4217
01:58:48.331 --> 01:58:51.650
<v Speaker 5>a large number of private prisons in this country.</v>

4218
01:58:51.651 --> 01:58:55.760
<v Speaker 5>And they lobby to make sure that laws are in place that allow them to keep their</v>

4219
01:58:55.761 --> 01:58:56.594
<v Speaker 5>prisons full.</v>

4220
01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:56.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4221
01:58:56.980 --> 01:58:59.800
<v Speaker 4>And they make all that money that they get from the government and they'll give</v>

4222
01:58:59.801 --> 01:59:00.240
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4223
01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:00.910
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4224
01:59:00.910 --> 01:59:01.743
<v Speaker 4>the prisoner,</v>

4225
01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:04.810
<v Speaker 4>like at the tent city in Arizona,</v>

4226
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:06.850
<v Speaker 4>they eat like 60 cents.</v>

4227
01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:11.560
<v Speaker 4>I think their meals are 40 cents per day is what they're feeding the prisoner.</v>

4228
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:16.830
<v Speaker 4>And they brag about feeding the dogs more valuable food during the day.</v>

4229
01:59:17.201 --> 01:59:17.970
<v Speaker 4>Like the dog seat,</v>

4230
01:59:17.970 --> 01:59:19.780
<v Speaker 4>like 70 cents worth of food per day.</v>

4231
01:59:19.930 --> 01:59:20.171
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4232
01:59:20.171 --> 01:59:21.430
<v Speaker 5>And they make them wear pink.</v>

4233
01:59:21.490 --> 01:59:22.323
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4234
01:59:22.770 --> 01:59:23.603
<v Speaker 5>that's so,</v>

4235
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:26.410
<v Speaker 3>and then they dump them out on the streets when they're done with their sentence</v>

4236
01:59:26.411 --> 01:59:27.710
<v Speaker 3>and they don't have a job,</v>

4237
01:59:27.711 --> 01:59:28.960
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have good health.</v>

4238
01:59:29.290 --> 01:59:31.030
<v Speaker 3>And then they go and rob a store again and again.</v>

4239
01:59:31.031 --> 01:59:32.140
<v Speaker 3>It could happen to anybody,</v>

4240
01:59:32.290 --> 01:59:33.123
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4241
01:59:33.330 --> 01:59:33.571
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4242
01:59:33.571 --> 01:59:34.530
<v Speaker 4>we're going to be in Phoenix.</v>

4243
01:59:34.531 --> 01:59:34.741
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

4244
01:59:34.741 --> 01:59:35.340
<v Speaker 4>Tomorrow?</v>

4245
01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:38.340
<v Speaker 4>Tomorrow and something could happen.</v>

4246
01:59:38.341 --> 01:59:41.850
<v Speaker 4>You know they see Ari and his weird nose.</v>

4247
01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:43.570
<v Speaker 5>Do you think they might think he's a terrorist?</v>

4248
01:59:43.810 --> 01:59:44.643
<v Speaker 5>Maybe?</v>

4249
01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:46.690
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

4250
01:59:46.690 --> 01:59:47.260
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

4251
01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:48.280
<v Speaker 5>If we're all together,</v>

4252
01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:48.790
<v Speaker 5>I think we'll,</v>

4253
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:49.060
<v Speaker 5>we'll,</v>

4254
01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:49.630
<v Speaker 5>we'll tell them.</v>

4255
01:59:49.630 --> 01:59:50.320
<v Speaker 5>Luckily,</v>

4256
01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:50.860
<v Speaker 5>luckily our,</v>

4257
01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:52.330
<v Speaker 5>he wears pink underwear anyway,</v>

4258
01:59:52.331 --> 01:59:55.830
<v Speaker 5>so we'll just Google his name and show that he's a hilarious standup comedian.</v>

4259
01:59:55.870 --> 01:59:56.141
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

4260

4267

<v Speaker 5>Ari's last special.</v>

4268
02:00:08.710 --> 02:00:09.543
<v Speaker 5>Passive aggressive.</v>

4269
02:00:09.580 --> 02:00:09.821
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4270
02:00:09.821 --> 02:00:11.440

02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:12.550
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

4273
02:00:16.290 --> 02:00:18.190

4374
02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:26.300
<v Speaker 5>Bandana around your neck.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4376
02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:28.880
<v Speaker 5>what kind of a guy wears a Bandana around his neck?</v>

4377
02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:30.800
<v Speaker 5>Tony in this cartoon,</v>

4378
02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:32.900
<v Speaker 5>the guy who wants you to choke them unconscious and fuck him.</v>

4379
02:02:33.270 --> 02:02:37.310
<v Speaker 5>Well the guy wants you to squeeze that thing until he blacks out and give them a</v>

4380
02:02:37.311 --> 02:02:38.144
<v Speaker 5>good fucking,</v>

4381
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:41.900
<v Speaker 5>there's no other reason for a man unless he's worried about dirt getting into</v>

4382
02:02:41.901 --> 02:02:42.734
<v Speaker 5>his neck,</v>

4383
02:02:43.190 --> 02:02:43.610
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

4384
02:02:43.610 --> 02:02:47.630
<v Speaker 5>That's why I better get an audition for woody if that happens.</v>

4385
02:02:47.631 --> 02:02:51.500
<v Speaker 5>Do you think there'll be a live action toy story and maybe why would they do</v>

4386
02:02:51.501 --> 02:02:52.334
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>

4387
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:53.540
<v Speaker 5>There'll be so dumb.</v>

4388
02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:54.141
<v Speaker 5>The kids would be like,</v>

4389
02:02:54.141 --> 02:02:55.310
<v Speaker 5>why are we seeing real people?</v>

4390
02:02:55.311 --> 02:02:58.490
<v Speaker 5>Where the fuck is woody playing with other adults?</v>

4391
02:02:59.000 --> 02:02:59.833
<v Speaker 5>Toy Box.</v>

4392
02:03:00.250 --> 02:03:01.083
<v Speaker 5>You'd perfect.</v>

4393
02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:02.793
<v Speaker 5>Weird.</v>

4394
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:03.111
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4395
02:03:03.111 --> 02:03:06.170
<v Speaker 5>You'd be perfect for the twilight zone version when woody comes to life.</v>

4396
02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:06.830
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4397
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:07.281
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4398
02:03:07.281 --> 02:03:08.480
<v Speaker 5>Like the parents don't see it,</v>

4399
02:03:08.481 --> 02:03:12.170
<v Speaker 5>but the kid does and you're giving the kid really fucked up advice and you're</v>

4400
02:03:12.171 --> 02:03:12.730
<v Speaker 5>woody.</v>

4401
02:03:12.730 --> 02:03:13.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4402
02:03:13.130 --> 02:03:16.010
<v Speaker 5>And the parents come in and all of a sudden you're back to being like a wooden</v>

4403
02:03:16.011 --> 02:03:16.580
<v Speaker 5>doll again.</v>

4404
02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:16.881
<v Speaker 5>Mommy,</v>

4405
02:03:16.881 --> 02:03:18.850
<v Speaker 5>my doll was just smoking a cigarette.</v>

4406
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:20.360
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

4407
02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:20.780
<v Speaker 5>I watched,</v>

4408
02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:22.550
<v Speaker 5>I binge watched a few of those recently.</v>

4409
02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:25.040
<v Speaker 5>Those old school twilight zone episodes the best.</v>

4410
02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:27.170
<v Speaker 5>It was so amazing.</v>

4411
02:03:27.380 --> 02:03:27.591
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4412
02:03:27.591 --> 02:03:31.970
<v Speaker 5>one of the cool things about it is they had so many different subjects to choose</v>

4413
02:03:31.971 --> 02:03:33.710
<v Speaker 5>from and they had to do it with a,</v>

4414
02:03:33.711 --> 02:03:35.510
<v Speaker 5>like a relatively small budget.</v>

4415
02:03:35.690 --> 02:03:39.560
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have much in terms of like special effects.</v>

4416
02:03:39.790 --> 02:03:40.221
<v Speaker 5>I'll give you,</v>

4417
02:03:40.221 --> 02:03:42.860
<v Speaker 5>go back and look at like some of the old special effects.</v>

4418
02:03:42.861 --> 02:03:44.540
<v Speaker 5>They were unbelievably laughable.</v>

4419
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:44.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4424
02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:55.070
<v Speaker 3>great episode where the girls wants to fix our face.</v>

4425
02:03:55.071 --> 02:03:56.210
<v Speaker 3>They don't show it the whole time.</v>

4426
02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:57.890
<v Speaker 3>They don't show the doctors' faces either.</v>

4427
02:03:57.891 --> 02:04:00.350
<v Speaker 3>And at the end she's like beautiful and everyone's hideous.</v>

4428
02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:01.280
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

4429
02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:01.640
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>

4430
02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:03.500
<v Speaker 3>we're going to send you off with people like you.</v>

4431
02:04:03.950 --> 02:04:04.461
<v Speaker 3>And at the end,</v>

4432
02:04:04.461 --> 02:04:04.941
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>

4433
02:04:04.941 --> 02:04:06.230
<v Speaker 3>she just wanted to be like them.</v>

4434
02:04:06.590 --> 02:04:07.423
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

4435
02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:08.533
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4436
02:04:08.570 --> 02:04:09.440
<v Speaker 3>spoiler alert.</v>

4437
02:04:10.510 --> 02:04:11.930
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter if they're so awesome.</v>

4438
02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:14.270
<v Speaker 5>When the guy was cleaning on the airplane wing.</v>

4439
02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:14.660
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4440
02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:16.220
<v Speaker 5>That one was William Shatner.</v>

4441
02:04:16.610 --> 02:04:18.200
<v Speaker 5>Cause I'm mad at the wake of this plane.</v>

4442
02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:20.330
<v Speaker 5>Amazing.</v>

4443
02:04:20.330 --> 02:04:21.530
<v Speaker 5>And the fucking outfit,</v>

4444
02:04:21.531 --> 02:04:23.300
<v Speaker 5>the thing hat on was so bad,</v>

4445
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:24.080
<v Speaker 5>so bad.</v>

4446
02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:24.913
<v Speaker 5>He was a furry,</v>

4447
02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:26.210
<v Speaker 5>it was essentially like a fairy,</v>

4448
02:04:26.220 --> 02:04:28.640
<v Speaker 5>like one of those people that goes to those conventions dresses up like a</v>

4449
02:04:28.641 --> 02:04:29.270
<v Speaker 5>mascot.</v>

4450
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.451
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4451
02:04:29.451 --> 02:04:30.141
<v Speaker 5>That's what it looked like.</v>

4452
02:04:30.141 --> 02:04:30.521
<v Speaker 5>And he slipped,</v>

4453
02:04:30.521 --> 02:04:32.900
<v Speaker 5>pretended to be like this like Gremlin John,</v>

4454
02:04:32.901 --> 02:04:37.530
<v Speaker 5>like pig Chewbacca picture with John Lithgow was the remake of it.</v>

4455
02:04:37.531 --> 02:04:37.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4456
02:04:37.770 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 5>In the</v>

4457
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:38.460
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

4458
02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Which is really good too.</v>

4459
02:04:39.650 --> 02:04:40.560
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>

4460
02:04:40.590 --> 02:04:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

02:04:40.910 --> 02:04:41.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4462
02:04:42.210 --> 02:04:42.361
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4463
02:04:42.361 --> 02:04:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Their premise is we're so genius.</v>

4464
02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:45.840
<v Speaker 1>There was so many good ones.</v>

4465
02:04:45.841 --> 02:04:48.060
<v Speaker 1>My favorite one was to serve man.</v>

4466
02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that one?</v>

4467
02:04:49.890 --> 02:04:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh it's the best.</v>

4468
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:53.750
<v Speaker 1>These aliens came down and they,</v>

4469
02:04:53.751 --> 02:04:56.760
<v Speaker 1>they brought with them this book and um,</v>

4470
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:59.550
<v Speaker 1>they were going to take people back to their planet and people like it all</v>

4471
02:04:59.551 --> 02:05:01.380
<v Speaker 1>signed up to go to their planet.</v>

4472
02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:02.520
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

4473
02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:05.850
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the book was they're going to teach people about all their</v>

4474
02:05:05.851 --> 02:05:07.740
<v Speaker 1>technology and how to,</v>

4475
02:05:07.741 --> 02:05:07.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4476
02:05:07.981 --> 02:05:09.480
<v Speaker 1>how to space travel and all that shit.</v>

4477
02:05:09.630 --> 02:05:13.710
<v Speaker 1>So they get these people on the ship and as they're hurting them on the ship,</v>

4478
02:05:13.711 --> 02:05:16.710
<v Speaker 1>they're all like much bigger than regular people as they're hurting them on the</v>

4479
02:05:16.711 --> 02:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>ship.</v>

4480
02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:18.370
<v Speaker 1>The Guy Yells at,</v>

4481
02:05:18.371 --> 02:05:19.890
<v Speaker 1>or it's a guy or a girl yells out,</v>

4482
02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:23.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a cookbook to serve man.</v>

4483
02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:24.211
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4484
02:05:24.211 --> 02:05:24.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4485
02:05:24.481 --> 02:05:28.350
<v Speaker 1>like they thought that the title to serve man was giving man all these</v>

4486
02:05:28.351 --> 02:05:32.520
<v Speaker 1>instructions and they deciphered all the different shit and they realize they're</v>

<v Speaker 1>going to eat all these people and so taken off.</v>

4496
02:05:49.250 --> 02:05:51.360

4499
02:05:54.150 --> 02:05:54.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4500
02:05:54.630 --> 02:05:57.110
<v Speaker 1>like gene wilder and Richard Pryor movies like I,</v>

4501
02:05:57.150 --> 02:05:59.340
<v Speaker 1>I almost don't want to watch them to see if they hold up.</v>

4502
02:05:59.341 --> 02:06:00.960
<v Speaker 1>But Richard Pryor stand up,</v>

4503
02:06:01.140 --> 02:06:02.160
<v Speaker 1>totally holds up.</v>

4504
02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Totally holds up an undisputed,</v>

4505
02:06:05.460 --> 02:06:07.770
<v Speaker 1>undisputed like number one of all time.</v>

4506
02:06:08.370 --> 02:06:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that he was like the most influential,</v>

4507
02:06:11.971 --> 02:06:12.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4508
02:06:12.750 --> 02:06:14.190
<v Speaker 1>He was like the most powerful,</v>

4509
02:06:14.191 --> 02:06:16.260
<v Speaker 1>he's like changed what comedy is too.</v>

4510
02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:17.850
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people like his honesty,</v>

4511
02:06:17.851 --> 02:06:19.380
<v Speaker 1>like when he was on fire and Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4516
02:06:24.330 --> 02:06:26.640
<v Speaker 1>I just like when you were talking about sitting in the back of the room and</v>

4517
02:06:26.641 --> 02:06:27.570
<v Speaker 1>watching people laugh,</v>

4518
02:06:27.690 --> 02:06:31.200
<v Speaker 1>that was like the moment that I ever realized how crazy standup comedy was.</v>

4519
02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:33.540
<v Speaker 1>My parents took me to see live in the sunset strip.</v>

4520
02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I was in the audience.</v>

4521
02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:35.371
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4522
02:06:35.371 --> 02:06:35.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4523
02:06:35.610 --> 02:06:39.690
<v Speaker 1>little kid 13 or something and all these people were like falling down laughing</v>

4524
02:06:39.691 --> 02:06:40.201
<v Speaker 1>in the crowd.</v>

4525
02:06:40.201 --> 02:06:41.040
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking,</v>

4526
02:06:41.041 --> 02:06:42.240
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen this before.</v>

4529
02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anybody fallen down.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And this guy's just talking.</v>

4531
02:06:48.090 --> 02:06:48.410
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4532
02:06:48.410 --> 02:06:48.901
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking like,</v>

4533
02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:50.610
<v Speaker 1>this is the funniest thing I probably have ever seen.</v>

4534
02:06:50.611 --> 02:06:51.444
<v Speaker 1>And he's just talking</v>

4535

4540
02:06:59.851 --> 02:07:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're standing on that stage in that,</v>

4541
02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:03.450
<v Speaker 1>in that room and you realize,</v>

4542

<v Speaker 10>how often do you come here again,</v>

4566
02:07:42.190 --> 02:07:43.150
<v Speaker 10>this is your home.</v>

4567
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:44.833
<v Speaker 10>What the hell?</v>

4568
02:07:44.860 --> 02:07:45.611
<v Speaker 10>Well for Ari,</v>

4572
02:07:49.781 --> 02:07:51.310
<v Speaker 10>He lived right next to pink dot.</v>

4573
02:07:51.460 --> 02:07:54.810
<v Speaker 10>So he would just walk to his fucking apartment and walked down the store every</v>

4574
02:07:54.811 --> 02:07:56.200
<v Speaker 10>day and he was there every day.</v>

4575
02:07:56.410 --> 02:07:58.120
<v Speaker 10>That dude lived in that place.</v>

4576
02:07:58.870 --> 02:08:00.340
<v Speaker 10>I remember when I first started hanging out there,</v>

4577
02:08:00.341 --> 02:08:03.310
<v Speaker 10>someone in the green room called it the island of misfit toys.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was driving home from the,</v>

4592
02:08:23.131 --> 02:08:26.220
<v Speaker 4>I are driving to the comedy store from the Ice House and there was an amber</v>

4593
02:08:26.221 --> 02:08:27.570
<v Speaker 4>alert on a,</v>

4594
02:08:28.530 --> 02:08:32.370
<v Speaker 4>on the radio and the guy had a nicer car than mine.</v>

4595
02:08:33.270 --> 02:08:34.440
<v Speaker 4>The abductor,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>

4597
02:08:35.370 --> 02:08:37.290
<v Speaker 4>this guy needs to get his fucking life together.</v>

4598
02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:40.860
<v Speaker 4>2014 Mercedes Benz I'm supposed to be on the lookout for.</v>

4599
02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:41.770
<v Speaker 10>Really?</v>

4600
02:08:41.770 --> 02:08:42.603
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4601
02:08:42.670 --> 02:08:43.830
<v Speaker 10>Well yeah,</v>

4602
02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:48.840
<v Speaker 10>but it must be really hard to make it in life when you're like a serial killer</v>

4603
02:08:49.211 --> 02:08:52.030
<v Speaker 10>or like a child molester or something along those lines,</v>

4604
02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:53.320
<v Speaker 10>like struggling with that.</v>

4605
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:54.820
<v Speaker 10>And being super successful.</v>

4606
02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:55.693
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4607
02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:56.710
<v Speaker 10>That's kind of crazy.</v>

4608
02:08:56.711 --> 02:08:57.544
<v Speaker 10>That's what I'm thinking.</v>

4609
02:08:57.550 --> 02:09:02.550
<v Speaker 4>This guy lives the kind of life where he wanted to be seen in a 2014 Mercedes</v>

4610
02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:08.520
<v Speaker 4>Benz and now he's the only guy with a 2014 Mercedes Benz who wants nobody to see</v>

4611
02:09:08.711 --> 02:09:09.544
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

4612
02:09:09.780 --> 02:09:12.030
<v Speaker 10>Maybe he only likes kids with tastes.</v>

4613
02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:16.500
<v Speaker 10>It's like some American psycho stuff right there.</v>

4614
02:09:16.860 --> 02:09:17.161
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it gets you just,</v>

4700
02:11:40.770 --> 02:11:43.190
<v Speaker 1>it hits a certain tone inside of you.</v>

4701
02:11:43.570 --> 02:11:45.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like the costumes in the twilight zone and you're like,</v>

4702
02:11:45.381 --> 02:11:46.970
<v Speaker 1>how did I think this was scary?</v>

4703
02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:48.140
<v Speaker 1>But that was a long time ago,</v>

4704
02:11:48.141 --> 02:11:48.740
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4705

<v Speaker 1>right</v>

4709
02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:56.500
<v Speaker 1>in his family.</v>

4710
02:11:57.580 --> 02:11:58.540
<v Speaker 10>He's the preacher.</v>

4711
02:11:58.630 --> 02:12:00.040
<v Speaker 10>He was a preacher in the show.</v>

4712
02:12:00.041 --> 02:12:00.730
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4713
02:12:00.730 --> 02:12:02.890
<v Speaker 10>Maybe he was just doing research for his role.</v>

4714
02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:10.920
<v Speaker 10>I just found a great video of this paint huffer and series of his,</v>

4721
02:12:16.810 --> 02:12:18.490
<v Speaker 10>it starts off 14 years.</v>

4722
02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:23.920
<v Speaker 10>Guy Roast battle does look like someone pretty crazy.</v>

4723
02:12:24.450 --> 02:12:25.283
<v Speaker 10>2009,</v>

4724
02:12:25.290 --> 02:12:26.170
<v Speaker 10>whoa.</v>

4725
02:12:26.171 --> 02:12:27.280
<v Speaker 10>Later in 2009,</v>

4726
02:12:27.310 --> 02:12:28.300
<v Speaker 10>he didn't look so good.</v>

4727
02:12:29.860 --> 02:12:34.860
<v Speaker 10>Oh my [inaudible] in the Ronald McDonald.</v>

4728
02:12:35.950 --> 02:12:37.090
<v Speaker 10>Every time they were arresting him,</v>

4729
02:12:37.091 --> 02:12:38.230
<v Speaker 10>he's got silver in his face.</v>

4730
02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:40.600
<v Speaker 10>He likes that color of March,</v>

4731
02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:40.690
<v Speaker 10>2009.</v>

4732
02:12:40.690 --> 02:12:41.560
<v Speaker 10>February,</v>

4733
02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:41.561
<v Speaker 10>2000.</v>

4734
02:12:41.561 --> 02:12:42.610
<v Speaker 10>Why are they going back and forth?</v>

4735
02:12:42.611 --> 02:12:43.810
<v Speaker 10>Rowdy Roddy huffer over.</v>

4736
02:12:43.811 --> 02:12:44.531
<v Speaker 10>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

4737
02:12:44.531 --> 02:12:48.670
<v Speaker 10>They went from March to a breakout or something going on?</v>

4738
02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:48.941
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4739
02:12:48.941 --> 02:12:49.690
<v Speaker 10>What does he get?</v>

4740
02:12:49.690 --> 02:12:50.540
<v Speaker 10>Clumps in his beard.</v>

4741
02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:52.870
<v Speaker 10>All paint his beard,</v>

4742
02:12:53.110 --> 02:12:54.130
<v Speaker 10>but this is going backwards.</v>

4743
02:12:54.131 --> 02:12:54.964
<v Speaker 10>This is February.</v>

4744
02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:56.680
<v Speaker 10>This is going January.</v>

4745
02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:58.270
<v Speaker 10>Like how is it going backwards?</v>

4746
02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:00.370
<v Speaker 10>It's such a bad huffing problem,</v>

4747
02:13:01.810 --> 02:13:04.090
<v Speaker 10>but this is weird because it's not showing like a progression.</v>

4748
02:13:04.091 --> 02:13:05.140
<v Speaker 10>It's showing a regression.</v>

4749
02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:07.250
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>

4750
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:09.540
<v Speaker 10>okay.</v>

4751
02:13:09.540 --> 02:13:12.700
<v Speaker 10>But that's 2008 back in time backwards.</v>

4752
02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:15.130
<v Speaker 10>Just to show you how long he's been doing it.</v>

4753
02:13:15.310 --> 02:13:17.440
<v Speaker 10>He actually looks better because of huffing paint,</v>

4754
02:13:17.710 --> 02:13:19.840
<v Speaker 10>I think in huffing paint might be actually good for this dude.</v>

4755
02:13:19.841 --> 02:13:20.110
<v Speaker 10>He's like,</v>

4756
02:13:20.110 --> 02:13:20.943
<v Speaker 10>you don't get it.</v>

4757
02:13:21.130 --> 02:13:21.671
<v Speaker 10>Oh my God.</v>

4758
02:13:21.671 --> 02:13:22.960
<v Speaker 10>They busted him huffing paint.</v>

4759
02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:28.000
<v Speaker 10>2000 and 5,003 was huffing paint</v>

4760
02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:31.320
<v Speaker 10>all over his face.</v>

4761
02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:34.080
<v Speaker 10>Oh my God.</v>

4762
02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:35.250
<v Speaker 10>That's hilarious.</v>

4763
02:13:35.250 --> 02:13:36.083
<v Speaker 10>Oh Jeez.</v>

4764
02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:40.320
<v Speaker 10>Eight first busted in [inaudible] 98 why?</v>

4765
02:13:40.321 --> 02:13:40.621
<v Speaker 10>He was like,</v>

4766
02:13:40.621 --> 02:13:41.160
<v Speaker 10>Whoa,</v>

4767
02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:41.993
<v Speaker 10>what's that?</v>

4768
02:13:42.450 --> 02:13:43.550
<v Speaker 10>He's the captain and anneal.</v>

4769
02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:45.510
<v Speaker 10>This guy looks so different.</v>

4770
02:13:45.511 --> 02:13:46.344
<v Speaker 10>He could be an actor.</v>

4771
02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:48.410
<v Speaker 10>It's going to end on [inaudible]</v>

4772
02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:52.950
<v Speaker 10>95 I feel like we should do a documentary around that guy.</v>

4773
02:13:53.620 --> 02:13:54.510
<v Speaker 10>Give Him all the painting,</v>

4774
02:13:54.511 --> 02:13:55.550
<v Speaker 10>wants it,</v>

4775
02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:56.460
<v Speaker 10>faces of death.</v>

4776
02:13:56.520 --> 02:13:57.630
<v Speaker 10>Ask him what he feels about life.</v>

4777
02:13:57.630 --> 02:13:59.700
<v Speaker 10>Give them like certain subjects and ask him to expound.</v>

4778
02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:00.240
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

4779
02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:04.290
<v Speaker 10>just film for like 10 hours and you can get 40 minutes of wisdom out of that.</v>

4780
02:14:04.410 --> 02:14:06.570
<v Speaker 10>Do you think he started with sharpies and then he graduated?</v>

4781
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:10.350
<v Speaker 10>I remember as a kid just sniffing sharpies.</v>

4782
02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:10.770
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4783
02:14:10.770 --> 02:14:11.910
<v Speaker 10>Get them right up to my nose.</v>

4784
02:14:12.020 --> 02:14:12.610
<v Speaker 10>Just,</v>

4785
02:14:12.610 --> 02:14:13.150
<v Speaker 10>Yup.</v>

4786
02:14:13.150 --> 02:14:13.430
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4787
02:14:13.430 --> 02:14:14.700
<v Speaker 10>Especially those fat ones.</v>

4788
02:14:14.701 --> 02:14:16.140
<v Speaker 10>The fact silver ones.</v>

4789
02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:17.100
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4790
02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:17.820
<v Speaker 10>The best.</v>

4791
02:14:17.820 --> 02:14:20.190
<v Speaker 10>What is it about certain smells like that?</v>

4792
02:14:20.250 --> 02:14:21.120
<v Speaker 10>Gasoline.</v>

4793
02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:22.433
<v Speaker 10>So what it is,</v>

4794
02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:23.393
<v Speaker 10>it's the best.</v>

4795
02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:23.740
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

4796
02:14:23.740 --> 02:14:25.110
<v Speaker 10>it's just that gasoline.</v>

4797
02:14:25.111 --> 02:14:26.160
<v Speaker 10>The smell of alcohol,</v>

4798
02:14:26.161 --> 02:14:27.120
<v Speaker 10>like rubbing alcohol.</v>

4799
02:14:27.650 --> 02:14:27.900
<v Speaker 10>Right.</v>

4800
02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:31.140
<v Speaker 10>But what is it about those smells that like attracts people?</v>

4801
02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:33.380
<v Speaker 10>Because it's like you want to keep it.</v>

4802
02:14:33.570 --> 02:14:34.980
<v Speaker 10>We all love it so hard.</v>

4803
02:14:35.190 --> 02:14:35.880
<v Speaker 10>Everybody does.</v>

4804
02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:36.450
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4805
02:14:36.450 --> 02:14:38.220
<v Speaker 10>I'd never met anybody who doesn't like the smell markers.</v>

4806
02:14:38.250 --> 02:14:39.090
<v Speaker 10>Do you like smell Marcus?</v>

4807
02:14:39.091 --> 02:14:39.420
<v Speaker 10>Jamie?</v>

4808
02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:40.253
<v Speaker 10>Yes.</v>

4809
02:14:40.410 --> 02:14:40.771
<v Speaker 10>He says,</v>

4810
02:14:40.771 --> 02:14:40.891
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

4811
02:14:40.891 --> 02:14:41.671
<v Speaker 10>he's got a marker right there.</v>

4812
02:14:41.671 --> 02:14:43.160
<v Speaker 10>He's practicing Brian.</v>

4813
02:14:43.250 --> 02:14:43.430
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>

4814
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.801
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

4815
02:14:43.801 --> 02:14:46.020
<v Speaker 10>but I used to hate the smell of skunks,</v>

4816
02:14:46.021 --> 02:14:47.430
<v Speaker 10>but now as a pot smoker,</v>

4817
02:14:47.431 --> 02:14:48.250
<v Speaker 10>I love skunks.</v>

4818
02:14:48.250 --> 02:14:50.640
<v Speaker 10>I loved the smell of shut downs when I was let off.</v>

4819
02:14:51.190 --> 02:14:52.023
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

4820
02:14:52.030 --> 02:14:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that it was explained to me or I read it somewhere actually that</v>

4821
02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:55.990
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4822
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:57.850
<v Speaker 1>when you smell skunk smell,</v>

4823
02:14:58.060 --> 02:15:00.100
<v Speaker 1>that's how good a dog's nose is,</v>

4824
02:15:00.370 --> 02:15:04.980
<v Speaker 1>is that skunk is such a particularly strong smell that you could smell it and</v>

4825
02:15:04.990 --> 02:15:07.330
<v Speaker 1>like just a few parts per million in the air.</v>

4826
02:15:07.570 --> 02:15:10.270
<v Speaker 1>That's why like you can be driving on the street and you could smell a skunk</v>

4827
02:15:10.271 --> 02:15:11.500
<v Speaker 1>that's nowhere near your car,</v>

4828
02:15:11.530 --> 02:15:12.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4829
02:15:12.250 --> 02:15:13.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like nowhere near,</v>

4830
02:15:13.121 --> 02:15:15.190
<v Speaker 1>not even a hundred feet from your car and you smell a skunk.</v>

4831
02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:16.051
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck can you smell it?</v>

4832
02:15:16.051 --> 02:15:16.660
<v Speaker 1>It's gone.</v>

4833
02:15:16.660 --> 02:15:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Well that's how a dog is with everything.</v>

4834
02:15:18.970 --> 02:15:21.790
<v Speaker 1>That's why dogs can like find dudes that are like running through the woods by</v>

4835
02:15:21.791 --> 02:15:22.690
<v Speaker 1>sniffing their socks.</v>

4836
02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:23.950
<v Speaker 1>They're like sniff the guys sock.</v>

4837
02:15:23.951 --> 02:15:26.200
<v Speaker 1>They get a set and they go off like they just,</v>

4838
02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:26.950
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

4839
02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:27.491
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

4840
02:15:27.491 --> 02:15:28.570
<v Speaker 1>you could smell a skunk like,</v>

4841
02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:28.751
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4842
02:15:28.751 --> 02:15:29.320
<v Speaker 1>it's over here.</v>

4843
02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:29.861
<v Speaker 1>It's over here.</v>

4844
02:15:29.861 --> 02:15:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Like you know like roughly as you're walking in the street,</v>

4845
02:15:32.561 --> 02:15:34.300
<v Speaker 1>if you're getting closer to where that skunk is,</v>

4846
02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:35.770
<v Speaker 1>which is incredible.</v>

4847
02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:36.530
<v Speaker 1>If you think about,</v>

4848
02:15:36.530 --> 02:15:38.500
<v Speaker 1>there's no other smell like that for us.</v>

4849
02:15:38.501 --> 02:15:40.000
<v Speaker 1>We're just such a small amount.</v>

4850
02:15:40.540 --> 02:15:41.321
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they'll stink.</v>

4851
02:15:41.321 --> 02:15:41.831
<v Speaker 1>Bomb things.</v>

4852
02:15:41.831 --> 02:15:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Remember those fucking things they used to throw in school?</v>

4853
02:15:43.870 --> 02:15:44.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4854
02:15:44.471 --> 02:15:46.750
<v Speaker 1>The little Capri Sun bags of us.</v>

4855
02:15:46.751 --> 02:15:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Think those little things.</v>

4856
02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:49.241
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4857
02:15:49.241 --> 02:15:49.781
<v Speaker 1>there will,</v>

4858
02:15:49.781 --> 02:15:50.411
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>

4859
02:15:50.411 --> 02:15:53.800
<v Speaker 1>they were like these little glass vials and they would throw them in the ground,</v>

4860
02:15:53.801 --> 02:15:56.330
<v Speaker 1>shadow them and the whole school,</v>

4861
02:15:56.331 --> 02:15:57.550
<v Speaker 1>it's just stink.</v>

4862
02:15:57.890 --> 02:16:01.690
<v Speaker 1>One asshole threw him in the ventilation system of the air conditioning system.</v>

4863
02:16:02.630 --> 02:16:03.463
<v Speaker 10>That's all right.</v>

4864
02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:04.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4865
02:16:04.011 --> 02:16:06.800
<v Speaker 1>He fucked the entire room up like the,</v>

4866
02:16:06.801 --> 02:16:09.170
<v Speaker 1>the whole class had to get evacuated.</v>

4867
02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:11.120
<v Speaker 1>It was so bad.</v>

4868
02:16:11.121 --> 02:16:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Like he just thrown it into the system,</v>

4869
02:16:13.550 --> 02:16:14.960
<v Speaker 1>went out into the hallways.</v>

4870
02:16:14.961 --> 02:16:15.111
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4871
02:16:15.111 --> 02:16:16.090
<v Speaker 1>everybody was gagging.</v>

4872
02:16:17.460 --> 02:16:18.720
<v Speaker 10>We didn't have stink bombs.</v>

4873
02:16:18.721 --> 02:16:23.721
<v Speaker 10>But one time a girl threw up fruit roll up next to me and I can still smell it.</v>

4874
02:16:25.230 --> 02:16:28.110
<v Speaker 10>It smells good fruit roll ups for me for forever.</v>

4875
02:16:28.670 --> 02:16:28.860
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4876
02:16:28.860 --> 02:16:29.880
<v Speaker 10>I guess when you get a,</v>

4877
02:16:29.890 --> 02:16:30.380
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

4878
02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:31.870
<v Speaker 5>when someone throws up around you,</v>

4879
02:16:31.900 --> 02:16:34.360
<v Speaker 5>your immediate instinct is to throw up because like,</v>

4880
02:16:34.780 --> 02:16:38.560
<v Speaker 5>it could be that it's food poisoning and that you react to that you all ate the</v>

4881
02:16:38.561 --> 02:16:41.470
<v Speaker 5>same food and you realize that they're getting sick and before your body can</v>

4882
02:16:41.471 --> 02:16:42.190
<v Speaker 5>digest it,</v>

4883
02:16:42.190 --> 02:16:42.640
<v Speaker 5>you just,</v>

4884
02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:43.180
<v Speaker 5>your body goes,</v>

4885
02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:43.331
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4886
02:16:43.331 --> 02:16:44.164
<v Speaker 5>this is bad food.</v>

4887
02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:45.490
<v Speaker 5>So if you smell someone puking,</v>

4888
02:16:45.491 --> 02:16:45.860
<v Speaker 5>you just start</v>

4889
02:16:45.860 --> 02:16:46.300
<v Speaker 4>Puca.</v>

4890
02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:46.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4891
02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:47.210
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

4892
02:16:47.210 --> 02:16:47.981
<v Speaker 4>that's amazing.</v>

4893
02:16:47.981 --> 02:16:49.000
<v Speaker 4>I love that stuff,</v>

4894
02:16:49.001 --> 02:16:49.890
<v Speaker 4>that natural,</v>

4895
02:16:49.891 --> 02:16:50.724
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4896
02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:51.700
<v Speaker 4>like what's the one with,</v>

4897
02:16:51.701 --> 02:16:52.240
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4898
02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:55.030
<v Speaker 4>like women and like if you smell a woman and,</v>

4899
02:16:55.420 --> 02:16:56.260
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

4900
02:16:56.650 --> 02:16:59.500
<v Speaker 4>like there's like a stink that you like,</v>

4901
02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:04.480
<v Speaker 4>then that means that you're like far genetically</v>

4902
02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:05.280
<v Speaker 5>apart.</v>

4903
02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:06.240
<v Speaker 5>Like a bad wiper.</v>

4904
02:17:06.990 --> 02:17:07.690
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

4905
02:17:07.690 --> 02:17:08.523
<v Speaker 5>Fairmont.</v>

4906
02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:09.513
<v Speaker 5>Fairmont.</v>

4907
02:17:10.430 --> 02:17:13.410
<v Speaker 5>What are you saying is that you have different genes?</v>

4908
02:17:13.411 --> 02:17:14.880
<v Speaker 5>You're not related in any way,</v>

4909
02:17:14.881 --> 02:17:16.140
<v Speaker 5>so it makes them more attractive.</v>

4910
02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:16.680
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4911
02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:18.330
<v Speaker 5>So it'd be good to breed with that person.</v>

4912
02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:19.160
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

4913
02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:19.860
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4914
02:17:19.860 --> 02:17:20.790
<v Speaker 5>Which is amazing,</v>

4915
02:17:20.910 --> 02:17:21.840
<v Speaker 5>but that throw up on,</v>

4916
02:17:21.841 --> 02:17:22.531
<v Speaker 5>that's a great one.</v>

4917
02:17:22.531 --> 02:17:23.910
<v Speaker 5>I've always wondered why that is,</v>

4918
02:17:24.010 --> 02:17:25.120
<v Speaker 5>but I always wondered,</v>

4919
02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:25.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4920
02:17:25.950 --> 02:17:30.290
<v Speaker 5>whether or not certain levels of diversity is attracting attractive to people at</v>

4921
02:17:30.291 --> 02:17:31.170
<v Speaker 5>sexual diversity.</v>

4922
02:17:31.171 --> 02:17:34.320
<v Speaker 5>Just because of like your genetics want to mix things up.</v>

4923
02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:35.071
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

4924
02:17:35.071 --> 02:17:39.810
<v Speaker 5>Like a lot of guys have Asian fetishes or maybe Norwegian fetishes like blondes,</v>

4925
02:17:39.811 --> 02:17:40.860
<v Speaker 5>they're like big blondes.</v>

4926
02:17:41.100 --> 02:17:41.461
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

4927
02:17:41.461 --> 02:17:43.140
<v Speaker 5>Like people get these [inaudible] and like what is that?</v>

4928
02:17:43.141 --> 02:17:43.351
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

4929
02:17:43.351 --> 02:17:48.000
<v Speaker 5>well you want to introduce those genes into your genes and just like push that</v>

4930
02:17:48.001 --> 02:17:49.050
<v Speaker 5>new system out there.</v>

4931
02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:52.890
<v Speaker 5>That's the combination because if you make close to your genes then yeah,</v>

4932
02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:54.750
<v Speaker 5>it could end up to formed or whatever.</v>

4933
02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:55.381
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4934
02:17:55.381 --> 02:17:59.520
<v Speaker 5>Like it's very rarely see like an all blonde couple blonde guy,</v>

4935
02:17:59.521 --> 02:18:00.360
<v Speaker 5>blond girl.</v>

4936
02:18:00.390 --> 02:18:01.800
<v Speaker 5>Well nothing wrong with loving blondes,</v>

4937
02:18:01.801 --> 02:18:02.790
<v Speaker 5>but you have dark hair.</v>

4938
02:18:02.791 --> 02:18:03.511
<v Speaker 5>So it's kind of like,</v>

4939
02:18:03.511 --> 02:18:04.260
<v Speaker 5>makes sense,</v>

4940
02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:04.501
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4941
02:18:04.501 --> 02:18:07.590
<v Speaker 5>Like so nineties like blondes mean girls.</v>

4942
02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:10.020
<v Speaker 5>I just like bonds like one guys.</v>

4943
02:18:10.980 --> 02:18:15.360
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever go to the beach and go a surfer trolling or something?</v>

4944
02:18:17.610 --> 02:18:19.110
<v Speaker 5>More dudes at Surf Blonde.</v>

4945
02:18:19.170 --> 02:18:19.650
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

4946
02:18:19.650 --> 02:18:20.280
<v Speaker 5>there you go.</v>

4947
02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:21.920
<v Speaker 5>Cause that's a fucking stereotype right there.</v>

4948
02:18:21.921 --> 02:18:24.660
<v Speaker 5>That is a surfer dudes are kind of dopey.</v>

4949
02:18:24.690 --> 02:18:25.800
<v Speaker 5>You would assume they're blondes.</v>

4950
02:18:25.860 --> 02:18:26.131
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

4951
02:18:26.131 --> 02:18:26.790
<v Speaker 5>what's up?</v>

4952
02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:29.020
<v Speaker 5>Didn't I see you on like a leeches?</v>

4953
02:18:29.940 --> 02:18:30.773
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>

4954
02:18:31.410 --> 02:18:31.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4955
02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:32.670
<v Speaker 5>but you assume they're idiots.</v>

4956
02:18:33.660 --> 02:18:33.811
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4957
02:18:33.811 --> 02:18:34.290
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

4958
02:18:34.290 --> 02:18:34.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4959
02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:34.961
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4960
02:18:34.961 --> 02:18:36.170
<v Speaker 5>And bleaches their brain to,</v>

4961
02:18:36.171 --> 02:18:36.780
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4962
02:18:36.780 --> 02:18:38.940
<v Speaker 5>like a guy with a nice blonde hair.</v>

4963
02:18:38.941 --> 02:18:40.350
<v Speaker 5>It will probably never be president.</v>

4964
02:18:40.530 --> 02:18:42.150
<v Speaker 5>What's his Fox News anchors?</v>

4965
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:44.570
<v Speaker 5>You Know Sandy,</v>

4966
02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:45.450
<v Speaker 5>it's gotta be saying,</v>

4967
02:18:45.450 --> 02:18:50.450
<v Speaker 5>I wonder is there anything like did the stereotype of dumb blondes is a very</v>

4968
02:18:50.641 --> 02:18:51.720
<v Speaker 5>common stereotype?</v>

4969
02:18:52.170 --> 02:18:53.310
<v Speaker 5>What is in that?</v>

4970
02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:54.653
<v Speaker 5>What's that about?</v>

4971
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:59.870
<v Speaker 5>Is that just that we men prefer blondes so some bonds don't have to work as hard</v>

4972
02:19:01.891 --> 02:19:02.880
<v Speaker 5>because they're blonde.</v>

4973
02:19:03.090 --> 02:19:08.090
<v Speaker 5>Or is there some weird link between having like light hair and lower</v>

4974
02:19:08.251 --> 02:19:09.084
<v Speaker 5>intelligence?</v>

4975
02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:10.560
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a little bit of both.</v>

4976
02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:13.070
<v Speaker 5>There must be some blonde geniuses though.</v>

4977
02:19:13.380 --> 02:19:14.213
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4978
02:19:14.310 --> 02:19:15.660
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a cultural thing.</v>

4979
02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:16.380
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>

4980
02:19:16.380 --> 02:19:16.671
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>

4981
02:19:16.671 --> 02:19:16.851
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4982
02:19:16.851 --> 02:19:18.660
<v Speaker 5>like surfer Dude Valley girl.</v>

4983
02:19:18.690 --> 02:19:23.640
<v Speaker 5>That's what I picture blonds like pop culture went a little bit overboard and</v>

4984
02:19:23.641 --> 02:19:24.740
<v Speaker 5>that's what everyone thinks of now.</v>

4985
02:19:24.750 --> 02:19:28.130
<v Speaker 5>Look bonds more rich white women and they're the ones that are at home</v>

4986
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:30.530
<v Speaker 1>like with handbags and like,</v>

4987
02:19:31.010 --> 02:19:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it,</v>

4988
02:19:31.730 --> 02:19:32.690
<v Speaker 1>that's where it came from.</v>

4989
02:19:32.810 --> 02:19:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Rich white women in their fucking hands.</v>

4990
02:19:34.670 --> 02:19:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4991
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Am I getting really racist at all?</v>

4992
02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:37.873
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4993
02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:38.541
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

4994
02:19:38.541 --> 02:19:41.000
<v Speaker 1>The part where you said every race looks alike was perfect.</v>

4995
02:19:41.630 --> 02:19:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4996
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:43.040
<v Speaker 1>So except white people.</v>

4997
02:19:43.620 --> 02:19:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4998
02:19:44.270 --> 02:19:44.720

5000
02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:45.590

02:19:45.590 --> 02:19:46.940
<v Speaker 1>the blonde thing,</v>

5002
02:19:46.941 --> 02:19:48.920
<v Speaker 1>like at the playboy level,</v>

5003
02:19:49.090 --> 02:19:51.800
<v Speaker 1>like playboy playmates were all blonde for a while.</v>

5004
02:19:51.801 --> 02:19:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Like that was the stereotypical playboy playmate,</v>

5005
02:19:54.621 --> 02:19:54.950
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5006
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:55.461
<v Speaker 1>Blonde,</v>

5007
02:19:55.461 --> 02:19:56.294
<v Speaker 1>blue eyes.</v>

5008
02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5009
02:19:56.840 --> 02:19:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Like how'd that happen?</v>

5010
02:19:57.681 --> 02:19:58.514
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

5011
02:19:58.580 --> 02:19:59.300
<v Speaker 1>what is the best</v>

5012
02:19:59.300 --> 02:20:00.490
<v Speaker 4>Hugh Hefner just being,</v>

5013
02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:00.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5014
02:20:00.890 --> 02:20:01.420
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5015
02:20:01.420 --> 02:20:02.620
<v Speaker 4>a fetishist.</v>

5016
02:20:02.650 --> 02:20:03.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5017
02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:04.060
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

5018
02:20:04.060 --> 02:20:04.840
<v Speaker 4>Like Mitzi,</v>

5019
02:20:04.840 --> 02:20:09.460
<v Speaker 4>they used to say that Mitzi hated blondes because she was a Brunette and she was</v>

5020
02:20:09.461 --> 02:20:10.810
<v Speaker 4>the queen of the comedy store.</v>

5021
02:20:10.811 --> 02:20:11.171
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

5022
02:20:11.171 --> 02:20:16.171
<v Speaker 4>I guess it was like impossible for a blonde girl that even not only not get</v>

5023
02:20:16.661 --> 02:20:17.740
<v Speaker 4>passed at the store,</v>

5024
02:20:17.741 --> 02:20:20.690
<v Speaker 4>but it was hard for them to get waitressing jobs at the store.</v>

5025
02:20:21.220 --> 02:20:21.781
<v Speaker 4>I've missed,</v>

5026
02:20:21.781 --> 02:20:25.960
<v Speaker 4>he just had this horse and all the cute little brunettes everywhere.</v>

5027
02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:26.913
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

5028
02:20:27.180 --> 02:20:27.451

5032
02:20:32.670 --> 02:20:34.800

02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Like one person like that in an ecosystem can change the entire,</v>

5034
02:20:39.961 --> 02:20:40.280
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

5035

<v Speaker 1>like with comedy,</v>

5036
02:20:41.490 --> 02:20:45.390
<v Speaker 1>one person like her change comedy would be realistic.</v>

5037
02:20:45.391 --> 02:20:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Like that club and like her contributions and her insistence on keeping it</v>

5042
02:20:52.291 --> 02:20:54.540
<v Speaker 1>She would take comics that don't like each other and she put them back to back</v>

5043
02:20:54.541 --> 02:20:54.931
<v Speaker 1>with each other.</v>

5044
02:20:54.931 --> 02:20:57.740
<v Speaker 1>So they had to introduce each other always.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's one of the coolest cities on the planet earth.</v>

5094
02:21:53.950 --> 02:21:54.341
<v Speaker 1>Denver.</v>

5095
02:21:54.341 --> 02:21:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

5096
02:21:55.210 --> 02:21:56.590
<v Speaker 1>One of the best spots ever,</v>

5097
02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:58.990
<v Speaker 1>and now with the weed and fusion,</v>

5098
02:21:59.110 --> 02:22:00.610
<v Speaker 1>that place is out of town.</v>

5099
02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:01.810
<v Speaker 1>They're just going crazy.</v>

5100
02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5101
02:22:02.290 --> 02:22:02.591
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

5102
02:22:02.591 --> 02:22:04.570
<v Speaker 1>apparently they passed it.</v>

5103
02:22:04.600 --> 02:22:08.080
<v Speaker 1>They pass legal weed in Washington DC.</v>

5104
02:22:08.110 --> 02:22:09.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you've seen that,</v>

5105
02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:11.680
<v Speaker 1>but there's some new</v>

5106
02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:15.880
<v Speaker 1>challenge to it by this,</v>

5107
02:22:15.881 --> 02:22:20.881
<v Speaker 1>a local politician who's being paid off a congressman who's being paid off by</v>

5108
02:22:21.851 --> 02:22:23.050
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies.</v>

5109
02:22:24.160 --> 02:22:26.580
<v Speaker 1>This guy named Harris from Maryland.</v>

5110
02:22:26.730 --> 02:22:31.080
<v Speaker 1>He just led the charge to overturn the will of Washington DC voters by inserting</v>

5111
02:22:31.081 --> 02:22:33.240
<v Speaker 1>language into Congress,</v>

5112
02:22:33.241 --> 02:22:37.080
<v Speaker 1>spending bill that prevents a district from implementing the referendum.</v>

5113
02:22:37.081 --> 02:22:41.610
<v Speaker 1>They passed to legalize recreational marijuana and the 2014 midterm election,</v>

5114
02:22:41.910 --> 02:22:42.750
<v Speaker 1>the referendum,</v>

5115
02:22:42.751 --> 02:22:43.231
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

5116
02:22:43.231 --> 02:22:46.740
<v Speaker 1>passed with 70% of the vote on election day.</v>

5117
02:22:46.860 --> 02:22:49.020
<v Speaker 1>So this hunt,</v>

5118
02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:54.920
<v Speaker 1>he introduced language into a bill sneakily stopping this from passing when 70%</v>

5119
02:22:55.891 --> 02:22:56.970
<v Speaker 1>of the population want it.</v>

5120
02:22:57.120 --> 02:22:58.590
<v Speaker 1>And when they asked him about it,</v>

5121
02:22:59.190 --> 02:23:04.190
<v Speaker 1>he said that relaxing marijuana laws clearly leads to more teenage drug use,</v>

5122
02:23:05.850 --> 02:23:07.080
<v Speaker 1>which is just a lie.</v>

5123
02:23:07.290 --> 02:23:08.400
<v Speaker 1>That's just not true.</v>

5124
02:23:08.670 --> 02:23:09.503
<v Speaker 1>It's just not true.</v>

5125
02:23:10.260 --> 02:23:11.071
<v Speaker 1>According to Gallup,</v>

5126
02:23:11.071 --> 02:23:13.530
<v Speaker 1>polls obviously pulls her full shit,</v>

5127
02:23:13.890 --> 02:23:16.140
<v Speaker 1>but marijuana use amongst 18 to 20 wine,</v>

5128
02:23:16.260 --> 02:23:21.260
<v Speaker 1>nine year olds has fallen 20% since 1985 so even though we'd is way more</v>

5129
02:23:22.141 --> 02:23:23.370
<v Speaker 1>accessible than ever before,</v>

5130
02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:26.430
<v Speaker 1>it's continued to drop because it's not a sneaky now.</v>

5131
02:23:26.490 --> 02:23:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

5132
02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5133
02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:31.770
<v Speaker 1>It's not as thrilling because it's like everyone's smoking.</v>

5134
02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:33.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5135
02:23:33.181 --> 02:23:34.860
<v Speaker 1>We all know that effect.</v>

5136
02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:36.630
<v Speaker 1>People don't like people telling them what to do.</v>

5137
02:23:36.990 --> 02:23:37.823
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

5138
02:23:37.950 --> 02:23:38.783
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5139
02:23:38.970 --> 02:23:39.900
<v Speaker 1>tell your kids what to do.</v>

5140
02:23:39.901 --> 02:23:40.734
<v Speaker 1>They're going to rebel.</v>

5141
02:23:41.190 --> 02:23:41.881
<v Speaker 1>The cops.</v>

5142
02:23:41.881 --> 02:23:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Kids always want to being criminals are doing something fucking crazy.</v>

5143
02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I dated a girl in high school that was went to Catholic school.</v>

5144
02:23:50.310 --> 02:23:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5145
02:23:50.700 --> 02:23:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh you dirty girl.</v>

5146
02:23:51.630 --> 02:23:52.920
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't shut it.</v>

5147
02:23:53.410 --> 02:23:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Only want to hear anymore.</v>

5148
02:23:54.390 --> 02:23:55.850
<v Speaker 1>I went to Catholic school too.</v>

5149
02:23:56.580 --> 02:23:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>

5150
02:23:57.080 --> 02:23:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5151
02:23:57.220 --> 02:23:58.050
<v Speaker 1>the girls.</v>

5152
02:23:58.050 --> 02:23:58.883
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>

5153
02:23:59.250 --> 02:24:02.760
<v Speaker 4>I'd imagine regular here moving a all girls.</v>

5154
02:24:02.761 --> 02:24:03.594
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5155
02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:06.120
<v Speaker 4>it's tough though man.</v>

5156
02:24:06.330 --> 02:24:11.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling Ya because that's hard to go to school with girls wearing skirts and</v>

5157
02:24:11.521 --> 02:24:16.521
<v Speaker 4>the girls were all super cute and they'd roll their skirts up and I remember,</v>

5158
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:17.940
<v Speaker 4>Hey I,</v>

5159
02:24:18.450 --> 02:24:21.420
<v Speaker 4>I had a boner like eight hours a day going to school.</v>

5160
02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:24.780
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to try to like settle it down before the,</v>

5161
02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:27.690
<v Speaker 4>before class would end just because you had to walk,</v>

5162
02:24:27.910 --> 02:24:28.800
<v Speaker 4>it was a big school,</v>

5163
02:24:28.801 --> 02:24:32.910
<v Speaker 4>three floors and you'd have to take the stairs so you couldn't have the boner in</v>

5164
02:24:32.911 --> 02:24:33.750
<v Speaker 4>between classes.</v>

5165
02:24:33.751 --> 02:24:37.890
<v Speaker 4>So you'd have to like focus on other things like your school work for the last</v>

5166
02:24:37.890 --> 02:24:39.090
<v Speaker 4>couple of minutes to get the bone or away.</v>

5167
02:24:39.300 --> 02:24:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Those 1617 year old boners are so different to oh they have just throbbing,</v>

5168
02:24:44.850 --> 02:24:48.330
<v Speaker 1>throbbing and they're re relatively recent in your life.</v>

5169
02:24:48.331 --> 02:24:49.830
<v Speaker 1>So they're incredibly confusing.</v>

5170
02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're 30 and you've been getting boners since you were 15 that's</v>

5171
02:24:54.570 --> 02:24:55.320
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>

5172
02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:55.920
<v Speaker 1>It seems like,</v>

5173
02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:57.120
<v Speaker 1>oh well here's a boner again,</v>

5174
02:24:57.150 --> 02:24:58.260
<v Speaker 1>I know how to deal with this.</v>

5175
02:24:58.530 --> 02:24:59.550
<v Speaker 1>But when you're 15 you're like,</v>

5176
02:24:59.580 --> 02:24:59.881
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5177
02:24:59.881 --> 02:25:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do.</v>

5178
02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:03.210
<v Speaker 1>You're so confused.</v>

5179
02:25:03.211 --> 02:25:08.211
<v Speaker 1>Like the power it has over your system is you are dealing with millions of years</v>

5180
02:25:09.031 --> 02:25:13.030
<v Speaker 1>of DNA that's telling you to breed and you're trying to find someone to do this</v>

5181
02:25:13.040 --> 02:25:13.873
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

5182
02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:17.760
<v Speaker 1>It's all going on be internally like behind the scenes,</v>

5183
02:25:17.761 --> 02:25:22.761
<v Speaker 1>but socially and culturally you're your face with repression and</v>

5184
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:29.100
<v Speaker 5>slut shaming and worry and fear of pregnancy and fear of disease.</v>

5185
02:25:30.761 --> 02:25:35.500
<v Speaker 5>And there's all this shit going on that confuses this like natural weird thing</v>

5186
02:25:35.501 --> 02:25:36.550
<v Speaker 5>that your body is going through.</v>

5187
02:25:36.551 --> 02:25:40.930
<v Speaker 5>Your body just wants to fuck you know when you're 16 that I remember that being</v>

5188
02:25:40.931 --> 02:25:42.220
<v Speaker 5>so confusing,</v>

5189
02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:47.350
<v Speaker 5>like relatively like having a relatively good control over my life until I</v>

5190
02:25:47.351 --> 02:25:48.250
<v Speaker 5>started getting boners.</v>

5191
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:49.383
<v Speaker 5>And then you know,</v>

5192
02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:50.321
<v Speaker 5>you wind up be like,</v>

5193
02:25:50.321 --> 02:25:51.400
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

5194
02:25:51.401 --> 02:25:52.390
<v Speaker 5>Like who am I?</v>

5195
02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:57.480
<v Speaker 5>But I remember specifically is how much more powerful the Boehner was that like</v>

5196
02:25:58.930 --> 02:26:00.730
<v Speaker 5>not only does a throb but it also,</v>

5197
02:26:00.731 --> 02:26:02.050
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if this happened with you guys,</v>

5198
02:26:02.051 --> 02:26:04.480
<v Speaker 5>but mine would stick just like straight up.</v>

5199
02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:06.370
<v Speaker 5>It's not like it is now where like if it,</v>

5200
02:26:06.371 --> 02:26:09.160
<v Speaker 5>if it happens then it's just a boner.</v>

5201
02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:14.320
<v Speaker 5>But it would be like star pointed more northward like a fucking compass or</v>

5202
02:26:14.321 --> 02:26:14.741
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

5203
02:26:14.741 --> 02:26:16.240
<v Speaker 5>You can go back there with a boner pills.</v>

5204
02:26:16.290 --> 02:26:19.660
<v Speaker 5>Well and were confused at why teachers are having sex with 17 year old boys.</v>

5205
02:26:19.661 --> 02:26:21.100
<v Speaker 5>They have throbbing dicks.</v>

5206
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:23.463
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

5207
02:26:24.310 --> 02:26:27.280
<v Speaker 5>Well I mean someone's sounds like they want to fuck some kids.</v>

5208
02:26:29.430 --> 02:26:29.650
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

5209
02:26:29.650 --> 02:26:30.101
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5210
02:26:30.101 --> 02:26:30.850
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>

5211
02:26:30.850 --> 02:26:31.091
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5212
02:26:31.091 --> 02:26:35.050
<v Speaker 5>If you or your husband is like barely hard and there's some 16 year old kid,</v>

5213
02:26:35.051 --> 02:26:40.051
<v Speaker 5>it's just rock cars flash putting his leg to this side.</v>

5214
02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:40.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5215
02:26:40.630 --> 02:26:44.050
<v Speaker 5>You're seeing the outline of it in his pants.</v>

5216
02:26:44.350 --> 02:26:48.060
<v Speaker 5>He has to talk to you about football practice and I just get so confused during</v>

5217
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:49.860
<v Speaker 5>football practice and it's a waste line.</v>

5218
02:26:49.861 --> 02:26:52.960
<v Speaker 5>A lot of time something happens in my legs get numb and that's where you have to</v>

5219
02:26:52.961 --> 02:26:53.291
<v Speaker 5>hide it.</v>

5220
02:26:53.291 --> 02:26:54.400
<v Speaker 5>You have to hide it up top.</v>

5221
02:26:54.401 --> 02:26:56.260
<v Speaker 5>You can't go any other direction with that.</v>

5222
02:26:56.261 --> 02:26:59.500
<v Speaker 5>You have to go along the belt and like pull your shirt out a little bit.</v>

5223
02:26:59.501 --> 02:27:02.310
<v Speaker 5>Untuck the shirt or you got to get into sweatshirts.</v>

5224
02:27:02.490 --> 02:27:02.750
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5225
02:27:02.750 --> 02:27:03.311
<v Speaker 5>Long ones,</v>

5226
02:27:03.311 --> 02:27:04.570
<v Speaker 5>they're a little bit too long for you.</v>

5227
02:27:05.110 --> 02:27:05.711
<v Speaker 5>They'd go down,</v>

5228
02:27:05.711 --> 02:27:06.400
<v Speaker 5>they'd cover,</v>

5229
02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:09.970
<v Speaker 5>cover your package and then you have to carry your books in front of it all.</v>

5230
02:27:10.570 --> 02:27:10.781
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5231
02:27:10.781 --> 02:27:11.770
<v Speaker 5>regulating kids.</v>

5232
02:27:11.771 --> 02:27:15.190
<v Speaker 5>Having sex is one of the most ridiculous things ever are trying in any way to</v>

5233
02:27:15.191 --> 02:27:16.750
<v Speaker 5>regulate kids or it's stopped them.</v>

5234
02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:17.800
<v Speaker 5>Then when they're trying to pull that,</v>

5235
02:27:17.801 --> 02:27:20.230
<v Speaker 5>push that abstinence like that's the best.</v>

5236
02:27:20.231 --> 02:27:23.380
<v Speaker 5>Abstinence is the best way to deal with sex with children.</v>

5237
02:27:23.650 --> 02:27:25.330
<v Speaker 5>Just keep them from having sex.</v>

5238
02:27:25.331 --> 02:27:26.164
<v Speaker 5>Abstain,</v>

5239
02:27:26.410 --> 02:27:27.243
<v Speaker 5>abstain,</v>

5240
02:27:27.970 --> 02:27:28.803
<v Speaker 5>abstain.</v>

5241
02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:31.060
<v Speaker 5>It's like saying don't eat to hungry people.</v>

5242
02:27:31.061 --> 02:27:33.830
<v Speaker 5>It's like getting hungry people and putting in a room full of food and saying,</v>

5243
02:27:33.831 --> 02:27:34.420
<v Speaker 5>don't eat.</v>

5244
02:27:34.420 --> 02:27:35.620
<v Speaker 5>That's how babies are made.</v>

5245
02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:36.510
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

5246
02:27:36.510 --> 02:27:37.343
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

5247
02:27:37.730 --> 02:27:38.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5248
02:27:38.300 --> 02:27:39.460
<v Speaker 5>But not telling them like,</v>

5249
02:27:39.461 --> 02:27:39.680
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

5250
02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:39.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5251
02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:41.980
<v Speaker 5>wear a condom or get on the pill.</v>

5252
02:27:42.070 --> 02:27:43.360
<v Speaker 5>Like something needs to happen here.</v>

5253
02:27:43.361 --> 02:27:45.340
<v Speaker 5>You guys can't just be shooting loads of each other.</v>

5254
02:27:45.341 --> 02:27:47.290
<v Speaker 5>You're 15 can't make kids.</v>

5255
02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:47.741
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5256
02:27:47.741 --> 02:27:51.190
<v Speaker 5>you could if we were living 10,000 years ago and nobody had invented schools</v>

5257
02:27:51.191 --> 02:27:52.024
<v Speaker 5>yet.</v>

5258
02:27:52.060 --> 02:27:53.590
<v Speaker 5>But that's the other thing about schools,</v>

5259
02:27:53.591 --> 02:27:57.010
<v Speaker 5>it's like we take kids and we take them away from the people that they're</v>

5260
02:27:57.011 --> 02:27:57.844
<v Speaker 5>learning from,</v>

5261
02:27:57.970 --> 02:28:02.970
<v Speaker 5>which is adults and we stick them with mostly other kids and a couple parents or</v>

5262
02:28:03.460 --> 02:28:06.490
<v Speaker 5>rather adults that barely can control the room.</v>

5263
02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:09.310
<v Speaker 5>So that becomes as Lord of the flies type situation.</v>

5264
02:28:09.311 --> 02:28:12.220

02:30:55.730 --> 02:30:56.563
<v Speaker 10>How would you know?</v>

5373
02:30:57.160 --> 02:30:58.040
<v Speaker 10>We'd have to go look,</v>

<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

5376
02:31:00.170 --> 02:31:02.990
<v Speaker 10>Do you remember like school plays when they did the musicals and they gave all</v>

5377
02:31:02.991 --> 02:31:03.591
<v Speaker 10>the shitty kids?</v>

5378
02:31:03.591 --> 02:31:05.300
<v Speaker 10>That one little thing,</v>

5379
02:31:05.390 --> 02:31:05.960
<v Speaker 10>thing,</v>

5380
02:31:05.960 --> 02:31:06.590
<v Speaker 10>thing,</v>

5381
02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:07.423
<v Speaker 10>xylophone.</v>

5382
02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:11.060
<v Speaker 10>They gave the shitty kids that couldn't play in the musical.</v>

5383
02:31:11.061 --> 02:31:11.301
<v Speaker 10>They're like,</v>

5384
02:31:11.301 --> 02:31:12.590
<v Speaker 10>you just tap this one.</v>

5387
02:31:17.231 --> 02:31:18.970
<v Speaker 1>All kids gravitate towards that.</v>

5388
02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:22.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a trap because there's not a lot of longevity in the xylophone.</v>

5389
02:31:22.530 --> 02:31:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Like you start,</v>

02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:21.000
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5552
02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.690
<v Speaker 1>like a famous white boxer like Vladimir Klitschko heavyweight champion.</v>

5553
02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:26.640
<v Speaker 1>If he showed up with sunglasses on and they're like,</v>

5557
02:35:30.060 --> 02:35:34.950
<v Speaker 1>White guys wearing like sunglasses indoors or at night shows a lack of</v>

5558
02:35:34.951 --> 02:35:36.240
<v Speaker 1>dedication to your craft.</v>

5559

5561
02:35:39.330 --> 02:35:39.940

02:40:37.651 --> 02:40:39.550
<v Speaker 1>it's getting to the point where popup up,</v>

5752
02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:39.901
<v Speaker 1>boop,</v>

5753
02:40:39.901 --> 02:40:40.111
<v Speaker 1>boop,</v>

5756
02:40:42.451 --> 02:40:44.850

<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

5778
02:41:15.361 --> 02:41:17.550

02:42:47.450 --> 02:42:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5837
02:42:47.870 --> 02:42:48.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it's good.</v>

5838
02:42:48.741 --> 02:42:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's bad.</v>

5839
02:42:49.490 --> 02:42:50.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5840
02:42:50.030 --> 02:42:50.863
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

5841
02:42:50.900 --> 02:42:51.733
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5842
02:42:51.950 --> 02:42:53.510
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the thing about human beings.</v>

5843
02:42:53.511 --> 02:42:56.090
<v Speaker 1>He's like even under less than ideal circumstances,</v>

5844
02:42:56.091 --> 02:42:57.560
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times cool people come out of it.</v>

5845
02:42:57.890 --> 02:42:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5846
02:42:58.220 --> 02:43:01.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a real dilemma involved in raising kids because you want to protect your</v>

5847
02:43:01.461 --> 02:43:01.761
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

5848
02:43:01.761 --> 02:43:06.761
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is adversity builds character and meeting weird people,</v>

5849
02:43:07.311 --> 02:43:10.970
<v Speaker 1>shitty people mean people like it gives you like a database to draw from.</v>

5850
02:43:11.350 --> 02:43:12.940
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing,</v>

5851
02:43:12.941 --> 02:43:13.840
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about this before,</v>

5852
02:43:13.841 --> 02:43:17.620
<v Speaker 1>but being around people who are kind of shitty makes you appreciate people who</v>

5853
02:43:17.621 --> 02:43:18.454
<v Speaker 1>are really cool.</v>

5854
02:43:19.150 --> 02:43:20.620
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing with your hand gestures?</v>

5855
02:43:21.360 --> 02:43:21.791
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes.</v>

5856
02:43:21.791 --> 02:43:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5857
02:43:22.390 --> 02:43:23.590
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't sure it was behind me.</v>

5858
02:43:23.710 --> 02:43:24.930
<v Speaker 1>And then you smelled your own arm.</v>

5859
02:43:26.140 --> 02:43:29.080
<v Speaker 1>And then I smelled my microphone and caught a whiff and was like,</v>

5860
02:43:30.060 --> 02:43:30.201
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5861
02:43:30.201 --> 02:43:31.034

5911
02:44:49.570 --> 02:44:52.810
<v Speaker 8>You would never believe it if you looked at it for the energy that's in those</v>

5912
02:44:52.811 --> 02:44:54.490
<v Speaker 8>rooms during roast battle and kill Tony,</v>

<v Speaker 8>it's all coming through to little tiny like bathrooms,</v>

5914
02:44:58.261 --> 02:44:58.810
<v Speaker 8>speakers,</v>

5915
02:44:58.810 --> 02:45:00.220
<v Speaker 8>how much the speakers cost.</v>

5916
02:45:01.030 --> 02:45:01.863
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

5917
02:45:02.380 --> 02:45:05.200
<v Speaker 8>W W W I told the general manager was just go in there,</v>

5918
02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:05.771
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5919
02:45:05.771 --> 02:45:07.630
<v Speaker 8>knew cause they need a new sound board.</v>

5920
02:45:07.631 --> 02:45:09.820
<v Speaker 8>Also the soundboards just as shitty sound byte.</v>

5921
02:45:09.821 --> 02:45:12.850
<v Speaker 8>It's been destroyed a thousand times.</v>

5922
02:45:13.060 --> 02:45:15.520
<v Speaker 8>And so just to get a quote and then whatever it is,</v>

5923
02:45:15.580 --> 02:45:16.990
<v Speaker 8>we'll just put it towards whatever.</v>

5924
02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:17.980
<v Speaker 1>That sounds dope.</v>

5925
02:45:17.981 --> 02:45:21.220
<v Speaker 1>So we can maybe do a few shows if you don't make the money in one show.</v>
