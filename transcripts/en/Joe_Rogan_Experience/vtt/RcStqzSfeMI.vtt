<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

3
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>do you smoke pot with strangers?</v>

4
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:04.170
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.650
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

6
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Me Neither.</v>

7
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:05.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

8
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

9
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.080
<v Speaker 1>If I don't know he might.</v>

10
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.330
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

11
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 1>it's too much risk.</v>

12
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

13
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>I tell people I don't,</v>

14
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I quit smoking it really,</v>

15
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>and I usually don't.</v>

16
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>I have to really know where the source of the weeders from before.</v>

17
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Before I'll accept it.</v>

18
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll give it friends of mine,</v>

19
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.310
<v Speaker 1>this is where I got this shit.</v>

21
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what I do.</v>

23
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

24
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>it's just certain people that I get high with that I know.</v>

25
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:28.981
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

26
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>it's unfortunate,</v>

27
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>but I've had,</v>

28
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>I know one guy that definitely came up to me that was a cop in Cleveland.</v>

29
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm positive.</v>

30
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I just knew something was going on,</v>

31
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

32
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>He's asking me where I could get DMT.</v>

33
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

34
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>and the way he was asked,</v>

35
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:42.720
<v Speaker 1>he said we had a crew cut.</v>

36
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>I looked like a trend.</v>

37
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.310
<v Speaker 1>They did MMA and I'm looking at this dude and I'm like,</v>

38
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.203
<v Speaker 1>you want what?</v>

39
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Strange guy that looks like a cop asked me where to get illegal drugs.</v>

40
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>I went when talking about,</v>

41
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>I once had two cops work their ass off for me.</v>

42
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.233
<v Speaker 1>It was funny,</v>

43
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I had a nightclub in Canada.</v>

44
00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

45
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>we're teaching men.</v>

46
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>And then I had to diet clubs in,</v>

47
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>in one cut closed down and saw it and they sold the building.</v>

48
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>So then I moved,</v>

49
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I had a back room,</v>

50
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:08.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>so I was fixing up a back room,</v>

52
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.680
<v Speaker 1>did take over the other club and next thing you know I got to a man and a girl</v>

53
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>with headbands,</v>

54
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 1>they come up stairs and they're like,</v>

55
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>they're not hippies by no means.</v>

56
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:29.481
<v Speaker 1>The headbands looked like a costume look like they're going trick or treating it</v>

57
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.181
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

58
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 1>this is how they dress swimming.</v>

59
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.941
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>

60
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:33.381
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

61
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>so what's going on up here?</v>

62
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.281
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

63
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:35.371
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

64
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm just putting the club together.</v>

65
00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:36.850
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

66
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.683
<v Speaker 1>I need some help.</v>

67
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.671
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so then the club filled up and they stayed the whole time.</v>

152
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>They didn't go home and change or anything.</v>
