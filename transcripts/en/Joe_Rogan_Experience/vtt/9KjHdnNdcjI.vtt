10
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>watch a hunting show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like people watch hunting shows</v>

11
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:23.761
<v Speaker 1>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>my own.</v>

16
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your show is so different from all those</v>

17
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>other shows like it belongs on something</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

18
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>It belongs on like the history channel</v>
<v Speaker 1>or discovery channel or something more</v>

19
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm glad that Netflix picked it up.</v>

20
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm delighted they picked up 32</v>

21
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad we got to this plugin part</v>

<v Speaker 1>because if I turn people off and they</v>

24
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>tune out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll remember this man,</v>

25
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.290
<v Speaker 1>this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just walk out the fucking door</v>

<v Speaker 2>Way More than 75.</v>

30
00:01:04.391 --> 00:01:05.560
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's sort of.</v>

31
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Just remember one day we had a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember one day I was having a drink</v>

32
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.440
<v Speaker 2>to celebrate us having wrapped number 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was long time ago.</v>

33
00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 2>So we're way past that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

34
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.420
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of weeks.</v>

35
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Upwards of 75.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of weeks out in the field.</v>

36
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hundredth.</v>

37
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll probably have a little party on</v>

38
00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:26.740
<v Speaker 2>the hundredth episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

39
00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:27.820
<v Speaker 2>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been great man.</v>

40
00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Netflix thing is really just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it really,</v>

41
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposed to a lot of,</v>

42
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people and it was cool.</v>

43
00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:36.610
<v Speaker 2>They instead of starting with season</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

44
00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:38.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put up season five and six a</v>

45
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is nice because it makes people</v>

46
00:01:41.591 --> 00:01:43.120
<v Speaker 2>real curious about the other ones.</v>

47
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.210
<v Speaker 1>There's one episode that's probably one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my favorite episodes you ever did</v>

48
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.540
<v Speaker 1>where you never shot anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one episode with you alone,</v>

49
00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>deer hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he started talking about your dad.</v>

50
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

51
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arizona area.</v>

52
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.190
<v Speaker 2>No music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of ambient sound,</v>

53
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.290
<v Speaker 2>loud wind who makes those choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like those editorial choices that was,</v>

54
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ed or one of our editors,</v>

55
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.840
<v Speaker 2>kind of one of our core editors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the editors that's been doing it for a</v>

56
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A guy by the name of guy.</v>

57
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.073
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

58
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.011
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

59
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:17.240
<v Speaker 2>he did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at first I was like,</v>

60
00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:18.074
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

61
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.161
<v Speaker 2>Because he wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

62
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:20.960
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to do one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no music.</v>

63
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.390
<v Speaker 2>There's no vo on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

64
00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:26.900
<v Speaker 2>and we're pretty vo heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sound pretty tend to be a voiceover,</v>

65
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.350
<v Speaker 2>like I do a lot of narrating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

66
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact I was just writing some</v>

67
00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:38.240
<v Speaker 2>narration for the United recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do a lot of narrating and then we</v>

68
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:39.800
<v Speaker 2>just did one with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no narrating.</v>

69
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.460
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of times it comes down</v>
<v Speaker 2>to how talkative I'm feeling in the</v>

70
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 2>field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

71
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

72
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:47.600
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

73
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.930
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason I was suffering a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of exhaustion or something.</v>

74
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.440
<v Speaker 2>I just did a lot of rambling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when he started cutting it</v>

75
00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:56.420
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just wanted to run it like that with</v>

76
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 2>no sound at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to one night with no music at</v>

77
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:01.114
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

78
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no voiceover,</v>

79
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No narration.</v>

80
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Just all spoken to camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No other people there.</v>

81
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.000
<v Speaker 2>So everything just like not delivered</v>
<v Speaker 2>his dialogue,</v>

82
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 2>just like two camera dressing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talk now about doing one that has no</v>

83
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 2>words in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all music maybe</v>

84
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 2>I was looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was looking for like,</v>

85
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 2>excitement to register on Joe's face and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the opposite.</v>

86
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's one of the things that I</v>

87
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 2>think is most ridiculous about a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting shows.</v>

88
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 2>Just how terrible the music is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the music choices.</v>

89
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you guys just go to fucking,</v>

90
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that program that you have on</v>

91
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:40.490
<v Speaker 2>your Mac?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When is that a garage.</v>

92
00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 2>Garage band?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

93
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 2>Pick up some beats and I don't know the</v>
<v Speaker 2>name of the system that we use,</v>

94
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

95
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.670
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a searchable database of music,</v>

96
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 2>like a catalog of music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The documentary we're doing,</v>

97
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're beginning now to work on,</v>

98
00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 2>we're in the initial stages of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

99
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.780
<v Speaker 2>having it scored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fun because it's not something</v>

100
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 2>I've ever messed with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

101
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're very rarely in a</v>

102
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.350
<v Speaker 2>television show or do you have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>television show scored,</v>

103
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're usually using library music or</v>

104
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:10.310
<v Speaker 2>licensed music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

105
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 2>I was watching westworld the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

106
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 2>which is an awesome show if you haven't</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen it.</v>

107
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was one scene with his music</v>

108
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 2>started playing.</v>

109
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so bad.</v>

110
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 2>I hate this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate when I'm being manipulated by</v>

111
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 2>music during a scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if the music is telling you to</v>

112
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.990
<v Speaker 2>where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they come up to and they're like,</v>

113
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to feel like this isn't</v>

114
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 2>making you feel how we wish it made you</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel.</v>

115
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps if we played this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll feel this way more.</v>

116
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird that we just,</v>

117
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 2>this is the part where you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to feel,</v>

118
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like a feelings of nostalgia</v>

119
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

120
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 2>and like these remorseful feelings and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have no idea how to invoke that in</v>

121
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 2>audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this musician did a wonderful job</v>

122
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 2>some years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's play this.</v>

123
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.080
<v Speaker 2>It's always like violins and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>piano,</v>

124
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.390
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about that that's</v>

125
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:02.930
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel so manipulated,</v>

126
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.550
<v Speaker 2>like I should just get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

127
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Because you're accepting these are</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories of success of like,</v>

128
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.440
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're giving me a program,</v>

129
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:13.590
<v Speaker 2>you're showing me something in an hour.</v>

130
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all these edits.</v>

131
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 2>We're going back and why can't I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>accept that,</v>

132
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.320
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

133
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a musician I liked quite a bit</v>

134
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 2>named Micah p Henson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>

135
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 2>he's out at Abilene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas and he has a song called the de</v>

136
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Texas sank to the bottom of the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a friend of mine who's a</v>

137
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 2>screenwriter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have joked about someday writing a</v>

138
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:36.970
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sad that you could play that song at</v>

139
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 2>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would not feel manipulative like</v>

140
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sad.</v>

141
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:44.340
<v Speaker 2>It could earn to have the day text,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sank to the bottom of the sea,</v>

142
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 2>played in the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his name again?</v>

143
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Mike?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A P hints and Micah and my ca.</v>

144
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

145
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 2>a h?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

146
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Seems like a young fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

147
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Seems like a young fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He seems like he's got a background in</v>

148
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 2>drug</v>

149
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 3>taken a one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

150
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.190
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

151
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

152
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 3>he's a good musician,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

153
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about music in movies</v>

154
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 3>that we've just totally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just totally accept it in television</v>

155
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 3>shows and music when there's a scene and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to manipulate you and they</v>

156
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 3>want to establish some sort of a feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're supposed to invoke.</v>

157
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:20.660
<v Speaker 3>They just lay it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The radio head album.</v>

158
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:23.570
<v Speaker 3>OK.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Computer has a song called exit music</v>

159
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 3>for film because I think they just felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it would be.</v>

160
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.960
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to send a message to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>licensers.</v>

161
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a wonder who was the first.</v>

162
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 3>I guess they did that back in the movies</v>
<v Speaker 3>before there was talkies,</v>

163
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was all when movies were silent.</v>

164
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how they sort of manipulated you</v>

165
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 3>and then they showed the screen and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>had the words on it that,</v>

166
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.140
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Peter and the wolf thing and</v>

167
00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:52.420
<v Speaker 3>then it just carried over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>

168
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.770
<v Speaker 3>Well we're working on the show with</v>
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>

169
00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.693
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

170
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've a hard time describing visual</v>

171
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:01.664
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

172
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 3>like I'll often see something like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>visual treatment for something,</v>

173
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or artwork or whatever.</v>

174
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.161
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

175
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:11.720
<v Speaker 3>I can't disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll know it when I see it.</v>

176
00:07:11.721 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 3>I'll know that I like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can't tell you what I like and</v>

177
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:16.720
<v Speaker 3>when we're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I listened to music when the editor</v>

178
00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:18.470
<v Speaker 3>is putting something together and I hear</v>
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>

179
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.220
<v Speaker 3>I never have suggestions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always just have no,</v>

180
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.680
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's me.</v>

181
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:25.514
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

182
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.690
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

183
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.381
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

184
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 3>And I never could be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it more,</v>

185
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

186
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.020
<v Speaker 3>I just had to hear it and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

187
00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too heavy handed or not.</v>

188
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 3>I saw one show where they were deer</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting and there was electronic music</v>

189
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 3>playing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

190
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:43.940
<v Speaker 3>who chose this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

191
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.190
<v Speaker 3>they might be trying to create like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird tension.</v>

192
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make you upset.</v>

193
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That way you want the deer to die</v>

194
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.210
<v Speaker 3>because they're forcing you to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this music.</v>

195
00:07:55.050 --> 00:08:00.050
<v Speaker 3>There's a great compilation of a hawks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're a rough legged hawks.</v>

196
00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:02.570
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I can't remember what time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

197
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.930
<v Speaker 3>just bitch slap and Mallard ducks up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada and the guy said it to hell's</v>

198
00:08:06.931 --> 00:08:08.110
<v Speaker 3>bells now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Always thought that</v>

199
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.010
<v Speaker 3>it was the obvious choice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just has a great effect watching a</v>

200
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.770
<v Speaker 3>hawks killed docs to hell's bells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

201
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.361
<v Speaker 3>but other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

202
00:08:18.361 --> 00:08:23.130
<v Speaker 3>I like it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always kinda like it to be not</v>

203
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.660
<v Speaker 3>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

204
00:08:24.661 --> 00:08:26.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like let's say you're doing a show in</v>

205
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.650
<v Speaker 3>West Virginia and so on and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

206
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.060
<v Speaker 3>we kick it off of some Banjo music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

207
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like I hate that kind of decision</v>
<v Speaker 3>making,</v>

208
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cliche.</v>

209
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

210
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.730
<v Speaker 3>and then I don't like it to be like</v>
<v Speaker 3>electronica to deer hunting.</v>

211
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Like you kind of want it to be sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

212
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.890
<v Speaker 3>not obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

213
00:08:46.891 --> 00:08:48.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

214
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.390
<v Speaker 3>Like who was it that decided to outer</v>
<v Speaker 3>space sounds the way it does,</v>

215
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.930
<v Speaker 3>like no one shows images of outer space</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Banjo.</v>

216
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 3>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And show images of outer space like do,</v>

217
00:08:58.051 --> 00:08:58.310
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

218
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.290
<v Speaker 3>do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or</v>

219
00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 5>it's gotta be like Star Wars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>symphony type music.</v>

220
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Someone decided to outer space feels</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a kind of music.</v>

221
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.270
<v Speaker 3>So if I was doing something about outer</v>
<v Speaker 3>space,</v>

222
00:09:10.271 --> 00:09:13.660
<v Speaker 3>I would want to find something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd never guess was outer spacey</v>

223
00:09:13.661 --> 00:09:17.470
<v Speaker 3>sounding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the end you're like,</v>

224
00:09:17.471 --> 00:09:18.304
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

225
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.910
<v Speaker 3>that's not out of place for outer space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a harmonica.</v>

226
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.103
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>

227
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.830
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll know when I hear it.</v>

228
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 5>I hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to enlist a bunch of the</v>

229
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 5>world best harmonica players who come up</v>
<v Speaker 5>with something spacey.</v>

230
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That'd be to watch outer space stuff.</v>

231
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.800
<v Speaker 5>I think like a didgeridoo would work for</v>
<v Speaker 5>space now.</v>

232
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:38.810
<v Speaker 5>You could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that,</v>

233
00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:39.601
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the,</v>

234
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 5>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the editors</v>

235
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.180
<v Speaker 3>all that music up for when they got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut to an Australia thing.</v>

236
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.440
<v Speaker 3>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

237
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.420
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's Australia sound like?</v>

238
00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:48.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

239
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.820
<v Speaker 3>The degree do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

240
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:50.990
<v Speaker 3>but yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix,</v>

241
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.250
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

242
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.460
<v Speaker 3>it's got a lot of emails and people kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of stumbling out of the show and it's</v>

243
00:09:57.461 --> 00:10:00.310
<v Speaker 3>funny because you make a show about</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting and you want to like in your</v>

244
00:10:00.311 --> 00:10:03.790
<v Speaker 3>head you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that like to hunt would have</v>

245
00:10:03.791 --> 00:10:05.530
<v Speaker 3>found it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you,</v>

246
00:10:05.531 --> 00:10:08.020
<v Speaker 3>you hear it from people who hunt their</v>
<v Speaker 3>asses off and they're like,</v>

247
00:10:08.021 --> 00:10:10.360
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just discovered the show</v>

248
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you realize this,</v>

249
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.540
<v Speaker 3>all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all the,</v>

250
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.680
<v Speaker 3>the untapped millions that are out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

251
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well there's a lot of people like me</v>

252
00:10:20.241 --> 00:10:23.210
<v Speaker 5>before I ever started hunting that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>interested in it.</v>

253
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.840
<v Speaker 5>They think it's interesting and I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>the gateway drug for them as those</v>

254
00:10:26.841 --> 00:10:31.310
<v Speaker 5>Alaska shows those like subsistence</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunter shows like the last frontier and</v>

255
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.890
<v Speaker 5>the mountain men chose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They show these people are like,</v>

256
00:10:33.891 --> 00:10:34.880
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that looks cool.</v>

257
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:35.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

258
00:10:35.841 --> 00:10:40.841
<v Speaker 5>and then I think the next step is to</v>
<v Speaker 5>switch on over the sportsmans channel or</v>

259
00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:43.030
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And something interesting point.</v>

260
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.470
<v Speaker 5>But you can get turned off really</v>
<v Speaker 5>easily.</v>

261
00:10:45.471 --> 00:10:49.310
<v Speaker 5>You could go to the wrong kind of show</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it can be boring or you can stumble</v>

262
00:10:49.311 --> 00:10:51.410
<v Speaker 5>upon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I always say about uncharted,</v>

263
00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:53.090
<v Speaker 5>the Jim shockey show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen that show?</v>

264
00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.990
<v Speaker 5>I have a great show and it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to me it's not really a hunting show.</v>

265
00:10:56.991 --> 00:10:59.630
<v Speaker 5>It's a show about cultures and travel</v>
<v Speaker 5>and culture.</v>

266
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about a really curious,</v>

267
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.500
<v Speaker 5>open minded guy who loves to go to</v>
<v Speaker 5>different cultures and he goes there,</v>

268
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:07.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the premises.</v>

269
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.920
<v Speaker 5>He goes there to hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's,</v>

270
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.280
<v Speaker 5>he's traveled to some really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really incredible places and film some</v>

271
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.760
<v Speaker 5>amazing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you see the one where he went to?</v>

272
00:11:15.761 --> 00:11:18.740
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget what river it was in Africa</v>

273
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.220
<v Speaker 5>where these people have a significant</v>
<v Speaker 5>problem with crocodiles eating.</v>

274
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.470
<v Speaker 5>Oh no I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've talked to some people about</v>

275
00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:27.330
<v Speaker 5>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody in the village was like</v>

276
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.600
<v Speaker 5>missing an arm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had a hole in their head.</v>

277
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.600
<v Speaker 5>This.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody had been jacked and while he</v>

278
00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:33.950
<v Speaker 5>was there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a woman got taken.</v>

279
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.070
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was crazy watching these people wail</v>

280
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:39.410
<v Speaker 5>and cry and sob.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was really,</v>

281
00:11:39.411 --> 00:11:40.790
<v Speaker 5>really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

282
00:11:40.791 --> 00:11:41.624
<v Speaker 5>I was in a</v>

283
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.930
<v Speaker 3>seventh grade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a teacher named Ms Dot Merkel.</v>

284
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if she's alive anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember she lived down the</v>

285
00:11:49.811 --> 00:11:53.080
<v Speaker 3>Muskegon river.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was in the Peace Corps and one,</v>

286
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.600
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we'll see is the hands on your kid</v>

287
00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:56.710
<v Speaker 3>and you realize later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

288
00:11:56.711 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 3>One day she brought in a photograph</v>

289
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:05.050
<v Speaker 3>of her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was her fiance at the time</v>

290
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:11.650
<v Speaker 3>of his body after it had been removed</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a crocodile's stomach.</v>

291
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To show us</v>

292
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.200
<v Speaker 3>now to set that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to set the times.</v>

293
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.110
<v Speaker 3>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was in ninth grade,</v>

294
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.920
<v Speaker 3>there was a teacher named Mr Wright and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted me to read blue,</v>

295
00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.110
<v Speaker 3>a shotgun form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the bluing on the shotgun,</v>

296
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.330
<v Speaker 3>like the coding on a shotgun and blew</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

297
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you do that?</v>

298
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.200
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a chemical dip.</v>

299
00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.770
<v Speaker 3>You Strip it and then it's like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical treatment blooming blooming.</v>

300
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.660
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of fallen out of favor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everything used to be blue.</v>

301
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.780
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just set scene like for what you could</v>

302
00:12:44.781 --> 00:12:48.200
<v Speaker 3>do back then that you don't do now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gave a shotgun to a kid,</v>

303
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.630
<v Speaker 3>brought shotgun school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave me the shotgun.</v>

304
00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.770
<v Speaker 3>I took her home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reboot it.</v>

305
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.660
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He paid me back with what?</v>

306
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:58.160
<v Speaker 3>He gave me a 25 caliber semiautomatic</v>
<v Speaker 3>handgun in a sweat sock</v>

307
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.560
<v Speaker 5>school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I brought it home and my dad confiscated</v>

308
00:13:03.561 --> 00:13:05.840
<v Speaker 5>it from me and I never saw it again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

309
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.200
<v Speaker 5>So the teacher gave you a hand gun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck is this teacher doing?</v>

310
00:13:11.301 --> 00:13:12.470
<v Speaker 5>Give me that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

311
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.210
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twenty five caliber.</v>

312
00:13:14.211 --> 00:13:18.770
<v Speaker 5>Semi auto in a sweat soc as payment for</v>
<v Speaker 5>blue and his shotgun.</v>

313
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.750
<v Speaker 5>The transaction all happened at</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>

314
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.750
<v Speaker 5>Is that in Michigan?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's my high school.</v>

315
00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.730
<v Speaker 5>So when I say the shadow,</v>

316
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.890
<v Speaker 3>she had a photo of a guy's body coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of a crocodile.</v>

317
00:13:31.891 --> 00:13:33.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

318
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.940
<v Speaker 3>that's not that long ago though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

319
00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:37.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm 43 now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old am I?</v>

320
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.020
<v Speaker 3>40 two times have changed pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>radically.</v>

321
00:13:40.021 --> 00:13:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when they instituted the rule</v>

322
00:13:42.931 --> 00:13:45.630
<v Speaker 3>that you couldn't have firearms at</v>
<v Speaker 3>school and I remember going down and</v>

323
00:13:45.631 --> 00:13:50.250
<v Speaker 3>talking to Mr Backman and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

324
00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:50.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

325

<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

326

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

327
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.180
<v Speaker 3>you guys aren't</v>

328
00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:58.180
<v Speaker 5>and everything</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you can stick a gun in your locker.</v>

329
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.910
<v Speaker 5>Have it</v>

330
00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.420
<v Speaker 3>your car in the parking lot though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

331
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.320
<v Speaker 3>Now for our documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we interviewed a guy who used to get on</v>

332
00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:09.670
<v Speaker 3>his school bus with his shotgun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit in Martha's vineyard of all</v>

333
00:14:09.671 --> 00:14:13.270
<v Speaker 3>places and he would get on the school</v>
<v Speaker 3>bus with the shotgun.</v>

334
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.980
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

335
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.330
<v Speaker 3>So he could hunt ducks afterschool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

336
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.480
<v Speaker 3>How old is this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Old.</v>

337
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.620
<v Speaker 3>He's a Vietnam veteran.</v>

338
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.000
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

339
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.030
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>

340
00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:33.031
<v Speaker 5>Started shooting people at school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if we could answer that.</v>

341
00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.700
<v Speaker 5>I've been talking about this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened to go and postal?</v>

342
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.570
<v Speaker 5>What did the post office figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 5>the post office get it together?</v>

343
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.640
<v Speaker 5>Like why did that stop happening?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like was it.</v>

344
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.340
<v Speaker 5>It was a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a game called postal.</v>

345
00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.650
<v Speaker 5>There was a video game that you could</v>
<v Speaker 5>play in the early days of video game</v>

346
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Speaker 5>called postal and this is another thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you probably couldn't do today,</v>

347
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.860
<v Speaker 5>but there was a video game based on mass</v>
<v Speaker 5>shootings.</v>

348
00:14:57.861 --> 00:15:00.170
<v Speaker 5>We'd go to a post office just fuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody up,</v>

349
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.180
<v Speaker 5>but was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>

350
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:02.900
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

351
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.000
<v Speaker 5>Of course I remembered that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't remember word.</v>

352
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:09.770
<v Speaker 5>They're actually like more than two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

353
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:11.510
<v Speaker 5>I was going to say it's called running</v>
<v Speaker 5>with scissors.</v>

354
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:15.500
<v Speaker 5>Was the company that made it look like</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the fucking game you would just</v>

355
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:19.730
<v Speaker 5>run around and shoot people and chop</v>
<v Speaker 5>them up and got them down.</v>

356
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's terrible graphics because it's the</v>

357
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.740
<v Speaker 5>early days of gun or excuse me with</v>
<v Speaker 5>video games?</v>

358
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.330
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks like my six year old did the</v>

359
00:15:26.331 --> 00:15:29.930
<v Speaker 5>pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is the game and this is like</v>

360
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:33.080
<v Speaker 5>the original grand theft daughter auto.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

361
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How can we could just go over the roof</v>

362
00:15:36.111 --> 00:15:38.120
<v Speaker 5>like that shitty ass physics.</v>

363
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:43.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean going postal was a thing that</v>

364
00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:46.570
<v Speaker 5>people used to say all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you said,</v>

365
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he went postal to like a tire now you</v>

366
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:50.670
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people talk about.</v>

367
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.390
<v Speaker 5>I think people will use.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Use it as being.</v>

368
00:15:52.391 --> 00:15:56.290
<v Speaker 5>You got real mad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a murderous thing.</v>

369
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:56.930
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

370
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.230
<v Speaker 5>But once it became in the lexicon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

371
00:15:59.231 --> 00:16:01.630
<v Speaker 5>you could say like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

372
00:16:01.631 --> 00:16:03.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he went and posted all about me,</v>

373
00:16:03.761 --> 00:16:05.760
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

374
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.630
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sending them the check.</v>

375
00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.090
<v Speaker 5>But you could say going postal because</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're 42,</v>

376
00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.260
<v Speaker 5>but could you say postal if you're 22,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think a 22 year old.</v>

377
00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.120
<v Speaker 5>Any idea what you're talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something happened.</v>

378
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.240
<v Speaker 5>It ended the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

379
00:16:18.241 --> 00:16:19.074
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

380
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.160
<v Speaker 5>the phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

381
00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.590
<v Speaker 5>What did the post office do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Questioning is.</v>

382
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.740
<v Speaker 5>What was it based on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two things.</v>

383
00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.850
<v Speaker 5>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Monotony.</v>

384
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.380
<v Speaker 5>Inbox.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Outbox inbox outbox.</v>

385
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.970
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

386
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:36.803
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

387
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.460
<v Speaker 5>how many postal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many,</v>

388
00:16:39.461 --> 00:16:42.530
<v Speaker 5>how many exam were there at post</v>
<v Speaker 5>offices?</v>

389
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:47.410
<v Speaker 5>Jamie's pulled them up here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at this to a 19,</v>

390
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.300
<v Speaker 5>86,</v>
<v Speaker 5>1991.</v>

391
00:16:49.301 --> 00:16:52.000
<v Speaker 5>Ninety one again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two events in [inaudible] 93 and took a</v>

392
00:16:52.001 --> 00:16:55.480
<v Speaker 5>13 year height and then it came back</v>
<v Speaker 5>strong in 2006.</v>

393
00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:56.800
<v Speaker 5>Baker city,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oregon,</v>

394
00:16:56.801 --> 00:16:58.990
<v Speaker 5>2006.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So 2006.</v>

395
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.330
<v Speaker 5>It seems like that was the last postal</v>
<v Speaker 5>event.</v>

396
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:07.200
<v Speaker 5>Says that was based around these ones in</v>
<v Speaker 5>1986 is where the term started.</v>

397
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:13.340
<v Speaker 5>So it probably is just a novelty thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like one person did it and then a bunch</v>

398
00:17:14.971 --> 00:17:15.760
<v Speaker 5>of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

399
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.800
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if there's a disproportionate</v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of mass shootings and post</v>

400
00:17:19.801 --> 00:17:22.800
<v Speaker 5>offices as compared to other warehouse</v>
<v Speaker 5>jobs or other.</v>

401
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because there's been mass shootings at</v>

402
00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:28.350
<v Speaker 5>work before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for some reason that distinction got</v>

403
00:17:28.351 --> 00:17:33.351
<v Speaker 5>put on post office</v>
<v Speaker 5>said 35 people and 11 incidents that is</v>

404
00:17:34.681 --> 00:17:36.360
<v Speaker 5>high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fairly high,</v>

405
00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:37.601
<v Speaker 5>but when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

406
00:17:37.601 --> 00:17:40.440
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with the number of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that come in and out of the post office.</v>

407
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.370
<v Speaker 5>Irate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

408
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.650
<v Speaker 5>But it's one of those weird things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

409
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 5>why don't you see that about Jiffy Lube?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no Jiffy Lube,</v>

410
00:17:50.011 --> 00:17:51.620
<v Speaker 5>mass shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

411
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't answer that.</v>

412
00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.310
<v Speaker 5>I bet there's people who studied at</v>
<v Speaker 5>carefully.</v>

413
00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.830
<v Speaker 5>I read the book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read the Book Columbine.</v>

414
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.300
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

415
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.320
<v Speaker 5>You read that book?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

416
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:03.600
<v Speaker 5>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just got a book from one of the</v>

417
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:05.460
<v Speaker 5>kids that survived,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

418
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.460
<v Speaker 5>met him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was with Marilyn Manson at this</v>

419
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:10.260
<v Speaker 5>podcast that we did for the election</v>
<v Speaker 5>night,</v>

420
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.230
<v Speaker 5>the end of the world podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

421
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.300
<v Speaker 5>he gave me a copy of his book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He survived,</v>

422
00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:18.090
<v Speaker 5>they came up to him right before the</v>
<v Speaker 5>shooting and they said,</v>

423
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:18.811
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we like,</v>

424
00:18:18.811 --> 00:18:20.280
<v Speaker 5>you get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

425
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he left and guns started blazing.</v>

426
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:23.643
<v Speaker 5>He survived.</v>

427
00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.133
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

428
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.720
<v Speaker 5>that'd be a good guy to have on your</v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

429
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to have them on the guy to go</v>
<v Speaker 5>to calm him by me.</v>

430
00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:33.150
<v Speaker 5>The guy that wrote Columbine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Columbine is a good book man.</v>

431
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean as far as the psychology of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

432
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the psychology and background and</v>

433
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.420
<v Speaker 5>context of shooters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

434
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.910
<v Speaker 5>it's a good book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an intense phenomenon,</v>

435
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is attributed to North America more</v>

436
00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:49.290
<v Speaker 5>than anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you starting to see a lot more</v>

437
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:52.380
<v Speaker 5>mass shootings all across the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of them are religious related,</v>

438
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.130
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

439
00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.390
<v Speaker 5>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a very confusing one to people</v>

440
00:18:57.391 --> 00:18:59.190
<v Speaker 5>because there's so many factors</v>
<v Speaker 5>involved,</v>

441
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's one that gets lumped in with a</v>

442
00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:02.680
<v Speaker 5>gun culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

443
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:07.500
<v Speaker 5>this is a tweet that I put on my twitter</v>
<v Speaker 5>page while back that I said this country</v>

444
00:19:07.501 --> 00:19:10.080
<v Speaker 5>has a mental health problem disguised as</v>
<v Speaker 5>a gun problem.</v>

445
00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.310
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I really,</v>

446
00:19:11.311 --> 00:19:12.720
<v Speaker 5>really believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

447
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:16.590
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you can attribute,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so many guns in this country and</v>

448
00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:19.440
<v Speaker 5>so few mass shootings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so many guns.</v>

449
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:24.630
<v Speaker 5>I mean the number of guns exceeds the</v>
<v Speaker 5>number of people and the amount of mass</v>

450
00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:27.980
<v Speaker 5>shootings in relative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously they're all horrible,</v>

451
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.170
<v Speaker 5>horrific and terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but relatively to the,</v>

452
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.220
<v Speaker 5>to the amount of people that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's relatively small.</v>

453
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 5>I think that the kind of person that can</v>
<v Speaker 5>engage in something like that,</v>

454
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.290
<v Speaker 5>there's so many factors and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 5>blame it on guns.</v>

455
00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:45.330
<v Speaker 5>It's like blaming forks on people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting fat.</v>

456
00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.900
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

457
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:55.280
<v Speaker 5>like when you look at the tendency to</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to like grasp bond to somewhat easy</v>

458
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:56.940
<v Speaker 5>solutions for stuff,</v>

459
00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.630
<v Speaker 5>it's something people go to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

460
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.000
<v Speaker 5>Because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems conquerable you know,</v>

461
00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:05.340
<v Speaker 5>so people go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people look at like a really complex</v>

462
00:20:05.341 --> 00:20:07.500
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We saw so much this during the round of</v>

463
00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:09.430
<v Speaker 5>the presidential election where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

464
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.550
<v Speaker 5>to make a point really fast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you look at something that's</v>

465
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 5>terrifically complex and it's not just</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you want the magic solution,</v>

466
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:18.090
<v Speaker 5>but who would kind of go like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

467
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:20.730
<v Speaker 5>what could be pop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what possibly could be done?</v>

468
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:25.770
<v Speaker 5>And I think people move in the direction</v>
<v Speaker 5>of moving in the direction of the second</v>

469
00:20:25.771 --> 00:20:28.560
<v Speaker 5>amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's also this sort of an</v>

470
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:30.570
<v Speaker 5>agreement that people have when</v>
<v Speaker 5>discussing it.</v>

471
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.480
<v Speaker 5>Like yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>guns are a problem and that guns are a</v>

472
00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:37.080
<v Speaker 5>problem because these things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they all start talking about</v>

473
00:20:37.081 --> 00:20:39.660
<v Speaker 5>guns and then if we get lumped into two</v>
<v Speaker 5>groups,</v>

474
00:20:39.661 --> 00:20:42.600
<v Speaker 5>you get lumped into people that are pro</v>
<v Speaker 5>second amendment that go,</v>

475
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:42.881
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

476
00:20:42.881 --> 00:20:43.860
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not guns.</v>

477
00:20:43.861 --> 00:20:45.390
<v Speaker 5>And then the people that say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

478
00:20:45.391 --> 00:20:47.470
<v Speaker 5>those crazy people with guns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

479
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.420
<v Speaker 5>Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was one of the famous,</v>

480
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:54.610
<v Speaker 5>one of the famous statement that he said</v>
<v Speaker 5>during his administration is how people</v>

481
00:20:54.611 --> 00:20:56.530
<v Speaker 5>are so attached to their guns and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>

482
00:20:56.531 --> 00:20:59.440
<v Speaker 5>the second amendment people got so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The NRA.</v>

483
00:20:59.441 --> 00:21:01.900
<v Speaker 5>People like the cling into religion and</v>
<v Speaker 5>guns.</v>

484
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

485
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.340
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

486
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:09.230
<v Speaker 5>if you just look at the sheer number of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who actually have guns in this</v>

487
00:21:09.231 --> 00:21:10.580
<v Speaker 5>country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is a little crazy.</v>

488
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.250
<v Speaker 5>I mean the volume is very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very high.</v>

489
00:21:13.251 --> 00:21:17.120
<v Speaker 5>The actual number of firearms and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that always gets me is they don't,</v>

490
00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.530
<v Speaker 5>it's not like they stopped making them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they're making guns every day,</v>

491
00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot less now since the election.</v>

492
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.080
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

493
00:21:24.081 --> 00:21:25.360
<v Speaker 5>I had this trump white friends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

494
00:21:25.361 --> 00:21:25.450
<v Speaker 5>Are</v>

495
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.870
<v Speaker 3>So convinced that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

496
00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.040
<v Speaker 3>or like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like most people in the country or</v>

497
00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.850
<v Speaker 3>whether you liked it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're convinced that Clinton was gonna</v>

498
00:21:34.851 --> 00:21:35.720
<v Speaker 3>win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

499
00:21:35.721 --> 00:21:36.554
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had,</v>

500
00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.710
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got one friend in particular that went</v>

501
00:21:39.711 --> 00:21:42.200
<v Speaker 3>out and bought a bunch of stocks for</v>
<v Speaker 3>company,</v>

502
00:21:42.201 --> 00:21:44.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire her companies and he said they took</v>

503
00:21:44.541 --> 00:21:48.440
<v Speaker 3>a little hit after the election because</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are relaxed.</v>

504
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:51.770
<v Speaker 3>They didn't worry about stockpiling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People aren't worried about stock pond.</v>

505
00:21:51.771 --> 00:21:53.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean we were all talking about it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

506
00:21:53.621 --> 00:21:54.454
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

507
00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.310
<v Speaker 3>the stockpiling thing is self</v>
<v Speaker 3>perpetuating.</v>

508
00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.550
<v Speaker 3>Where when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a little kid,</v>

509
00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our Christmas stocking we would get</v>

510
00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:07.970
<v Speaker 3>bricks at 22 shells because we use 22,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd hunt small,</v>

511
00:22:07.971 --> 00:22:09.320
<v Speaker 3>we'd done a lot of squirrels and</v>
<v Speaker 3>rabbits,</v>

512
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.540
<v Speaker 3>20 twos and it's just like you always at</v>
<v Speaker 3>22 shells,</v>

513
00:22:11.541 --> 00:22:13.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could go anywhere and get 22 shells,</v>

514
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:17.540
<v Speaker 3>a body mind one of our camera guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he grew up on a ranch and at the ranch</v>

515
00:22:17.541 --> 00:22:22.541
<v Speaker 3>store they had two items chew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so tins of chew in 22 shells that you</v>

516
00:22:24.471 --> 00:22:26.270
<v Speaker 3>could get on credit at the ranch store.</v>

517
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.820
<v Speaker 3>The ranch store was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a very limited inventory,</v>

518
00:22:28.821 --> 00:22:32.030
<v Speaker 3>but that's like how pervasive 22 shells</v>
<v Speaker 3>were.</v>

519
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.850
<v Speaker 3>Now when Obama won,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

520
00:22:34.851 --> 00:22:36.170
<v Speaker 3>no one's going to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty two,</v>

521
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.810
<v Speaker 3>22 is not a goto caliber for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for doing,</v>

522
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.830
<v Speaker 3>inflicting harm on other human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

523
00:22:41.831 --> 00:22:42.081
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

524
00:22:42.081 --> 00:22:45.020
<v Speaker 3>it's just not a great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very small,</v>

525
00:22:45.021 --> 00:22:48.110
<v Speaker 3>small game round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the history about guns drove people</v>

526
00:22:48.111 --> 00:22:52.280
<v Speaker 3>to gobble up 22 animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all of a sudden then it was you</v>

527
00:22:52.281 --> 00:22:55.100
<v Speaker 3>couldn't find 20 to animal and not being</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to find it.</v>

528
00:22:55.101 --> 00:22:56.990
<v Speaker 3>Like I used to just buy these little</v>
<v Speaker 3>boxes of 50,</v>

529
00:22:56.991 --> 00:22:58.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

530
00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.031
<v Speaker 3>you go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

531
00:22:59.031 --> 00:23:01.400
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to buy it and then all of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden you've gotten the need where you</v>

532
00:23:01.401 --> 00:23:04.250
<v Speaker 3>wanted to buy all you could get because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was in your head that you couldn't</v>

533
00:23:04.251 --> 00:23:08.270
<v Speaker 3>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you'd see a thousand of them and</v>

534
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.250
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to buy it because everyone's</v>

535
00:23:10.251 --> 00:23:11.084
<v Speaker 3>buying it.</v>

536
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:15.080
<v Speaker 3>And I think it was self perpetuating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I got shitloads of 22 shifts.</v>

537
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:17.210
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no need for them.</v>

538
00:23:17.211 --> 00:23:17.681
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

539
00:23:17.681 --> 00:23:20.440
<v Speaker 3>I felt in this thing like there's this</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that I've always had access to and</v>

540
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.910
<v Speaker 3>I won't have access to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

541
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.340
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

542
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:28.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that now all through the</v>

543
00:23:28.851 --> 00:23:30.950
<v Speaker 3>last eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been just this,</v>

544
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.220
<v Speaker 3>there's been this like great arming of</v>
<v Speaker 3>America because I feel like so many</v>

545
00:23:34.221 --> 00:23:37.200
<v Speaker 3>people were worried about having their</v>
<v Speaker 3>rights and fringed it was like,</v>

546
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.370
<v Speaker 3>there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least now in that community of which</v>

547
00:23:40.371 --> 00:23:42.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose there's a,</v>

548
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.900
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a sigh of relief.</v>

549
00:23:44.901 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

550
00:23:46.011 --> 00:23:49.730
<v Speaker 3>there's a great relaxation amongst</v>
<v Speaker 3>sports when they think that trump is</v>

551
00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:52.010
<v Speaker 3>gonna come in and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

552
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:53.570
<v Speaker 3>protect the second amendment rights.</v>

553
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:58.570
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of people got to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be worried about private land or</v>

554
00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.970
<v Speaker 3>public land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

555
00:23:59.971 --> 00:24:01.610
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that I'm really</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching.</v>

556
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm curious about it,</v>

557
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this point,</v>

558
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the talks over,</v>

559
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:10.730
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rhetorics over.</v>

560
00:24:10.731 --> 00:24:15.530
<v Speaker 3>So now I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

561
00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether someone was forward or against</v>

562
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:21.860
<v Speaker 3>it for or against trump's victory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think now like the responsible thing</v>

563
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:25.450
<v Speaker 3>to do in my mind are the realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible thing to do.</v>

564
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.500
<v Speaker 3>My mind is because there's so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>unknowns,</v>

565
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:30.890
<v Speaker 3>just approached the administration with</v>
<v Speaker 3>an open mind.</v>

566
00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:31.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

567
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.031
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'm like,</v>

568
00:24:32.031 --> 00:24:34.070
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the talks over now like what's gonna,</v>

569
00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.140
<v Speaker 3>what's gonna happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what sorts of things that we're</v>

570
00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:38.440
<v Speaker 3>going to see come out of it and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know if anyone really knows the answer</v>

571
00:24:38.441 --> 00:24:43.441
<v Speaker 3>to that and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like in my outward public facing</v>

572
00:24:44.181 --> 00:24:47.900
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't generally talk about politics</v>

573
00:24:47.901 --> 00:24:52.901
<v Speaker 3>outside of issues that relate to</v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife issues that relate to hunters</v>

574
00:24:53.511 --> 00:24:54.170
<v Speaker 3>and fishermen.</v>

575
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.780
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I kind of focused in because I</v>

576
00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.740
<v Speaker 3>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a mess,</v>

577
00:24:57.741 --> 00:24:58.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm all over the place.</v>

578
00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:03.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no use for and I know you don't</v>

579
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:05.120
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no use for like classic</v>

580
00:25:05.121 --> 00:25:07.090
<v Speaker 3>definitions of conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberals to just,</v>

581
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 3>that shit makes no sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't get,</v>

582
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't draw my viewpoints from going</v>
<v Speaker 3>and looking and finding out how I'm</v>

583
00:25:12.621 --> 00:25:17.330
<v Speaker 3>supposed to feel about it in order to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a consistent part isn't individual.</v>

584
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last January though,</v>

585
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people who aren't even theirs,</v>

586
00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's probably a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't familiar with this.</v>

587
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:25.670
<v Speaker 3>Can I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I give a quick rundown on public</v>

588
00:25:25.671 --> 00:25:26.420
<v Speaker 3>lands?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

589
00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:31.420
<v Speaker 3>So the federal government has holds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>owns millions and millions of acres of</v>

590
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.280
<v Speaker 3>land in the US,</v>
<v Speaker 3>primarily in the western us.</v>

591
00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.950
<v Speaker 3>And there's a handful of different land</v>
<v Speaker 3>holding agencies.</v>

592
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.190
<v Speaker 3>You have the bureau of land management,</v>
<v Speaker 3>manages lands,</v>

593
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.700
<v Speaker 3>the US fish and wildlife service manages</v>
<v Speaker 3>lands through the refuge system.</v>

594
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.350
<v Speaker 3>So when those boys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

595
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.080
<v Speaker 3>in Oregon took over the wildlife refuge</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

596
00:25:51.081 --> 00:25:53.750
<v Speaker 3>that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was actually,</v>

597
00:25:53.751 --> 00:25:57.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>us fish and wildlife service land wasn't</v>

598
00:25:57.441 --> 00:25:59.630
<v Speaker 3>blm land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got the national forest holds</v>

599
00:25:59.631 --> 00:26:03.620
<v Speaker 3>Land National Forest Service,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is under the Usta already said the</v>

600
00:26:03.621 --> 00:26:04.310
<v Speaker 3>Blm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

601
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

602
00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.040
<v Speaker 3>and then of course you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

603
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.970
<v Speaker 3>a states owned public land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the but the federal land management</v>

604
00:26:10.971 --> 00:26:15.440
<v Speaker 3>agencies of which there are several hold</v>
<v Speaker 3>deed to millions acres land and,</v>

605
00:26:15.441 --> 00:26:19.280
<v Speaker 3>and they wrap it is owned by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>American people and it's represented</v>

606
00:26:19.281 --> 00:26:21.860
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might think of it as represented</v>

607
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:25.040
<v Speaker 3>through a trust and the trust is</v>
<v Speaker 3>administered by the federal government</v>

608
00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:28.190
<v Speaker 3>on your behalf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's our public lands where people</v>

609
00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:29.160
<v Speaker 3>recreate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

610
00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.270
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another large holder of public lands and</v>

611
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.770
<v Speaker 3>National Parks Service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mention that one.</v>

612
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.400
<v Speaker 3>A gene in the lower 48,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

613
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.960
<v Speaker 3>you don't hunt on national park land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fish on national park land and you</v>

614
00:26:41.961 --> 00:26:44.400
<v Speaker 3>generally haunt national land bureau,</v>
<v Speaker 3>land management,</v>

615
00:26:44.401 --> 00:26:47.270
<v Speaker 3>land refuge land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

616
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.990
<v Speaker 3>there's a push right now to the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel that we should,</v>

617
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:55.260
<v Speaker 3>that the federal government should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>dumping a lot of federal land.</v>

618
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:58.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now the,</v>

619
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.210
<v Speaker 3>for what reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why you asked that,</v>

620
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:03.930
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm good at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people get frustrated with dealing</v>

621
00:27:03.931 --> 00:27:08.130
<v Speaker 3>with the federal bureaucracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason that is,</v>

622
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:13.160
<v Speaker 3>is generally the feds are pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a gross generalization,</v>

623
00:27:13.261 --> 00:27:18.261
<v Speaker 3>but generally the feds are pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are much slower on exploitation of</v>

624
00:27:18.541 --> 00:27:21.450
<v Speaker 3>natural resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less responsive to demand for</v>

625
00:27:21.451 --> 00:27:25.290
<v Speaker 3>exploitation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural resources than state agencies</v>

626
00:27:25.291 --> 00:27:27.600
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So federal lands,</v>

627
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>

628
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.000
<v Speaker 3>They in exercising the will of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>American people,</v>

629
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.820
<v Speaker 3>federal land agencies are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

630
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.780
<v Speaker 3>not as easy to deal with when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>to mining and development and other</v>

631
00:27:42.781 --> 00:27:46.170
<v Speaker 3>issues as state agencies are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people who are,</v>

632
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:51.230
<v Speaker 3>who want to see a more readily</v>
<v Speaker 3>exploitable system in place for,</v>

633
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.120
<v Speaker 3>for developers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>miners,</v>

634
00:27:54.121 --> 00:27:56.700
<v Speaker 3>loggers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>others will want to see like people able</v>

635
00:27:56.701 --> 00:27:59.370
<v Speaker 3>to more readily make a buck off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>land,</v>

636
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.430
<v Speaker 3>they'd like to see these lands that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>federal lands,</v>

637
00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:05.390
<v Speaker 3>they'd like to see him go into private</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands or like to see him go into state</v>

638
00:28:05.391 --> 00:28:08.220
<v Speaker 3>hands because they know that either way</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes,</v>

639
00:28:08.221 --> 00:28:10.110
<v Speaker 3>if they go into private hands or state</v>
<v Speaker 3>lands,</v>

640
00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:14.220
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna have a much easier time</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing extractive industries in</v>

641
00:28:14.221 --> 00:28:15.750
<v Speaker 3>development on those lands.</v>

642
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.330
<v Speaker 3>So that's what that's like under the</v>
<v Speaker 3>surface.</v>

643
00:28:18.331 --> 00:28:19.560
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

644
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.990
<v Speaker 3>and then for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the guy,</v>

645
00:28:21.991 --> 00:28:23.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons the guys that took</v>

646
00:28:23.371 --> 00:28:24.870
<v Speaker 3>over the refuge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

647
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:30.200
<v Speaker 3>a wildlife refuge in Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of their gripes was they run cattle</v>

648
00:28:30.991 --> 00:28:32.450
<v Speaker 3>on public property,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

649
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:37.460
<v Speaker 3>So they pay a fee that one of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>families is heavily involved in running</v>

650
00:28:37.801 --> 00:28:42.801
<v Speaker 3>cattle on federal land and they pay a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fee far below the going rate to run</v>

651
00:28:44.641 --> 00:28:47.260
<v Speaker 3>cattle on public lands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is what you'd go pay a branch,</v>

652
00:28:47.261 --> 00:28:48.780
<v Speaker 3>or if you wanted to run cattle on his</v>
<v Speaker 3>land,</v>

653
00:28:48.781 --> 00:28:52.050
<v Speaker 3>they pay about 10 percent of that by</v>
<v Speaker 3>some estimations to run it on public</v>

654
00:28:52.051 --> 00:28:54.480
<v Speaker 3>land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when federal land managers</v>

655
00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:59.340
<v Speaker 3>don't want to renew those contracts</v>
<v Speaker 3>because again,</v>

656
00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:01.220
<v Speaker 3>because people are thinking about other</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>

657
00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:04.410
<v Speaker 3>other uses for the land or whatever they</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to do with it,</v>

658
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:07.320
<v Speaker 3>it causes an intense amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a serious amount of frustration</v>

659
00:29:07.321 --> 00:29:07.800
<v Speaker 3>with people.</v>

660
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.210
<v Speaker 3>So there's people don't want to dump</v>
<v Speaker 3>lands.</v>

661
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.270
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard Donald Trump speak,</v>

662
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last January,</v>

663
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:19.520
<v Speaker 3>so almost a year ago in Las Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was standing 40 yards away from</v>

664
00:29:22.321 --> 00:29:25.860
<v Speaker 3>me and was talking about the that he has</v>
<v Speaker 3>no desire to see the,</v>

665
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.530
<v Speaker 3>he has no desire to see our public lands</v>
<v Speaker 3>privatized.</v>

666
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.310
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

667
00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:34.350
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

668
00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.110
<v Speaker 3>one might argue kind of by name only.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

669
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:38.160
<v Speaker 3>he's Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

670
00:29:38.161 --> 00:29:40.470
<v Speaker 3>he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He definitely hasn't demonstrated in any</v>

671
00:29:40.471 --> 00:29:42.910
<v Speaker 3>sense of being beholden to party</v>
<v Speaker 3>orthodoxy.</v>

672
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:43.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

673
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.110
<v Speaker 3>he takes it issue by issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stance on things and doesn't really care</v>

674
00:29:47.111 --> 00:29:49.450
<v Speaker 3>for how things are done at the party</v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

675
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.270
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his party is very much a,</v>

676
00:29:52.271 --> 00:29:53.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>

677
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.820
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's right in there.</v>

678
00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.630
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the planks of their platform</v>
<v Speaker 3>is right in their agenda to see us dump</v>

679
00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:01.690
<v Speaker 3>federal property to see us offload</v>
<v Speaker 3>federal lands,</v>

680
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.510
<v Speaker 3>to see us offload American public lands</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

681
00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.310
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into state or private holdings.</v>

682
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:07.631
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

683
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:10.940
<v Speaker 3>I hope that he has good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope he has luck and resisting that if</v>

684
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.390
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if in fact he is still standing by that</v>

685
00:30:13.391 --> 00:30:15.520
<v Speaker 3>statement that you made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think most people in America</v>

686
00:30:15.521 --> 00:30:19.870
<v Speaker 3>understand how unique this situation is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have these massive swaths of</v>

687
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:21.910
<v Speaker 3>public land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

688
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.210
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

689
00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.830
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even the people that do,</v>

690
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:29.320
<v Speaker 3>even the people that know don't really</v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptualize,</v>

691
00:30:29.321 --> 00:30:31.760
<v Speaker 3>like I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

692
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:36.990
<v Speaker 3>I grew up about two and a half miles</v>
<v Speaker 3>south of the southern terminus of</v>

693
00:30:37.421 --> 00:30:41.020
<v Speaker 3>manistee national forest in Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

694
00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:47.010
<v Speaker 3>a significant portion of our outdoor</v>
<v Speaker 3>activities took place on that national</v>

695
00:30:47.051 --> 00:30:48.460
<v Speaker 3>forest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We took it like,</v>

696
00:30:48.461 --> 00:30:49.450
<v Speaker 3>it fell from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

697
00:30:49.451 --> 00:30:51.490
<v Speaker 3>our perception of it was that it fell</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the sky.</v>

698
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.870
<v Speaker 3>It was that it just existed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

699
00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.010
<v Speaker 3>just had always existed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we took it for granted,</v>

700
00:31:00.011 --> 00:31:01.330
<v Speaker 3>like how you look at the sun and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

701
00:31:01.331 --> 00:31:03.040
<v Speaker 3>the sun is just there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

702
00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:08.100
<v Speaker 3>So I think that even people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>public lands users don't often don't</v>

703
00:31:09.281 --> 00:31:12.100
<v Speaker 3>take the time to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is it that I'm able to be on this</v>

704
00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:16.420
<v Speaker 3>land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why I never considered it at all until I</v>

705
00:31:16.421 --> 00:31:17.620
<v Speaker 3>hung out with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

706
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.330
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying I hung out on public</v>

707
00:31:19.331 --> 00:31:22.450
<v Speaker 3>lands and it wasn't for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't until I was,</v>

708
00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:26.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took me 25 years to start being like</v>

709
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:27.820
<v Speaker 3>not home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It now what does this now,</v>

710
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:32.140
<v Speaker 3>this public lands you speak of that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold deed like the,</v>

711
00:31:32.141 --> 00:31:36.760
<v Speaker 3>as an American citizen at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in most ways as a global citizen because</v>

712
00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:40.960
<v Speaker 3>our national for our public lands are</v>
<v Speaker 3>open to anyone American or not right?</v>

713
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.930
<v Speaker 3>But as an American citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hold deed to hundreds of millions of</v>

714
00:31:43.931 --> 00:31:47.440
<v Speaker 3>acres of land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there are conditions to your use</v>

715
00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:51.100
<v Speaker 3>like just things you can and cannot do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're free to roam camp,</v>

716
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.640
<v Speaker 3>Hunt Fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the stars,</v>

717
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:55.930
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

718
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:59.040
<v Speaker 3>You're extraordinarily wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

719
00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:02.580
<v Speaker 3>and these things that came about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they came out in various ways,</v>

720
00:32:02.581 --> 00:32:05.440
<v Speaker 3>it's probably the most influential</v>
<v Speaker 3>person in creating the public land</v>

721
00:32:05.441 --> 00:32:07.810
<v Speaker 3>system we have now is Theodore</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roosevelt,</v>

722
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:12.700
<v Speaker 3>and he was controversial in his time for</v>
<v Speaker 3>creating,</v>

723
00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.830
<v Speaker 3>are for helping to create our public</v>
<v Speaker 3>land system.</v>

724
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:20.340
<v Speaker 3>He had the same resistance when he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it from industry,</v>

725
00:32:20.621 --> 00:32:23.740
<v Speaker 3>from extractive industry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had the same resistance that we have</v>

726
00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:28.360
<v Speaker 3>now to public lands and then went and</v>
<v Speaker 3>chiseled his face on a mountain because</v>

727
00:32:28.361 --> 00:32:29.620
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like now everyone,</v>

728
00:32:29.621 --> 00:32:33.970
<v Speaker 3>every politician would like to liken</v>
<v Speaker 3>himself to Roosevelt.</v>

729
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:34.720
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

730
00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.430
<v Speaker 3>He's like one of those dudes and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>just be like,</v>

731
00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.840
<v Speaker 3>like Teddy Roosevelt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people are like,</v>

732
00:32:37.841 --> 00:32:38.800
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive feelings,</v>

733
00:32:38.801 --> 00:32:42.260
<v Speaker 3>positive feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's achieved rushmore.</v>

734
00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.760
<v Speaker 3>This was a guy who was like a radical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see a little bit of that with</v>

735
00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:47.690
<v Speaker 3>Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

736
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.220
<v Speaker 3>During the Reagan administration during</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time where he was actually president</v>

737
00:32:51.221 --> 00:32:53.570
<v Speaker 3>and massively polarizing figure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

738
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:55.310
<v Speaker 3>People hated him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

739
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.950
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was so much going on during the</v>

740
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Iran Contra hearings where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

741
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.060
<v Speaker 3>who is this asshole that we let run</v>
<v Speaker 3>president?</v>

742
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think around the time,</v>

743
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:06.530
<v Speaker 3>like by the time he died he had to sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of ascended to political heaven.</v>

744
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:07.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

745
00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Now you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

746
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.930
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy enjoys that position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

747
00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.800
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy barely won the damn election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

748
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:14.830
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's debated whether he actually won</v>

749
00:33:14.831 --> 00:33:15.290
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

750
00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:17.210
<v Speaker 3>people say it all these volts wound up</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Lake Michigan.</v>

751
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.000
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a lot of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>shenanigans going on with that election</v>

752
00:33:20.001 --> 00:33:22.700
<v Speaker 3>with the Mafia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was a big part of how he got</v>

753
00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.960
<v Speaker 3>elected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

754
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:27.320
<v Speaker 3>but later in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reluctant look back and say,</v>

755
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.060
<v Speaker 3>now there is a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

756
00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:32.360
<v Speaker 3>And so roosevelt creating our national</v>
<v Speaker 3>forest system.</v>

757
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

758
00:33:35.031 --> 00:33:36.820
<v Speaker 3>he was considered a radical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

759
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.930
<v Speaker 3>It was like this outlandish idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

760
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.020
<v Speaker 3>you mean to tell me you're just going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>take huge chunks of land.</v>

761
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.560
<v Speaker 3>They could earn some individuals an</v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary amount of money right now</v>

762
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:53.890
<v Speaker 3>and just set it aside for just joe blow</v>
<v Speaker 3>future person to enjoy.</v>

763
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:58.700
<v Speaker 3>And he even made a point where he went</v>
<v Speaker 3>on to say at one time that,</v>

764
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.480
<v Speaker 3>that he was doing it for those in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>womb of time.</v>

765
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:03.703
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

766
00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:07.320
<v Speaker 3>Because at the time people were arguing</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

767
00:34:07.321 --> 00:34:09.480
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if public land like,</v>

768
00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:13.110
<v Speaker 3>because here's the other thing we</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't that kind of pertains to this is</v>

769
00:34:13.111 --> 00:34:17.190
<v Speaker 3>wildlife in the Americas publicly owned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like most countries is not like</v>

770
00:34:17.191 --> 00:34:18.840
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like while leaving us is publicly owned,</v>

771
00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:21.420
<v Speaker 3>so a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've got a deer standing on your</v>

772
00:34:21.421 --> 00:34:22.680
<v Speaker 3>neighbor's place,</v>

773
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:29.260
<v Speaker 3>you as not a federal citizen citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you as a citizen of your state owned</v>

774
00:34:30.171 --> 00:34:32.870
<v Speaker 3>that deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That person can control access to it,</v>

775
00:34:32.871 --> 00:34:36.200
<v Speaker 3>but it's not as deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can prevent you from going up to it</v>

776
00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:38.450
<v Speaker 3>because you can't go on his land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he has no more right to that deer</v>

777
00:34:38.451 --> 00:34:42.620
<v Speaker 3>than you do generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when people said to Roosevelt like,</v>

778
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.780
<v Speaker 3>how are you blocking industry out of all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these lands and how are you blocking</v>

779
00:34:47.781 --> 00:34:50.840
<v Speaker 3>industry from getting at the the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife so we can sell the wildlife?</v>

780
00:34:50.841 --> 00:34:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Back when we had commercial hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

781
00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.620
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's for the people,</v>

782
00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.790
<v Speaker 3>give it to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's when he had his line.</v>

783
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:59.541
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

784
00:34:59.541 --> 00:35:02.030
<v Speaker 3>but it's for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for those still in the womb of time.</v>

785
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.300
<v Speaker 3>That's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's deep.</v>

786
00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:08.120
<v Speaker 3>People didn't like them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure someone tried to do that today.</v>

787
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:09.620
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a thing one time where he had a</v>

788
00:35:09.621 --> 00:35:10.970
<v Speaker 3>timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had to.</v>

789
00:35:10.971 --> 00:35:11.840
<v Speaker 3>He had to drop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a.</v>

790
00:35:11.841 --> 00:35:15.170
<v Speaker 3>There was an endo when he could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He kept just throwing shit into national</v>

791
00:35:15.171 --> 00:35:17.300
<v Speaker 3>forest for everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy was an office.</v>

792
00:35:17.301 --> 00:35:20.690
<v Speaker 3>I think he saved about something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>50,000 square miles of land or</v>

793
00:35:20.691 --> 00:35:23.390
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of model and for everyday I</v>

794
00:35:23.391 --> 00:35:25.310
<v Speaker 3>could be wrong with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but an absurd amount of land for</v>

795
00:35:25.311 --> 00:35:27.410
<v Speaker 3>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was an office and there's a thing he</v>

796
00:35:27.411 --> 00:35:31.070
<v Speaker 3>did call the midnight forest where he</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a deadline that expired,</v>

797
00:35:31.071 --> 00:35:35.030
<v Speaker 3>like his ability to keep drawing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Chunks of national forest was set to</v>

798
00:35:35.031 --> 00:35:37.950
<v Speaker 3>expire at a certain time on midnight and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was up</v>

799
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:42.030
<v Speaker 2>to last minute and midnight with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple aides marking up maps making</v>

800
00:35:42.031 --> 00:35:44.130
<v Speaker 2>giant national forest and now we</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrate them all.</v>

801
00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

802
00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they made.</v>

803
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:48.080
<v Speaker 2>When they made yellowstone also national</v>
<v Speaker 2>park,</v>

804
00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.880
<v Speaker 2>people were pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure mineral resources in their</v>

805
00:35:52.881 --> 00:35:54.820
<v Speaker 2>mental piss today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Timber in there.</v>

806
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying all these big decisions</v>

807
00:35:57.031 --> 00:36:00.410
<v Speaker 2>like these decisions happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did we create a public land system in</v>

808
00:36:00.411 --> 00:36:03.530
<v Speaker 2>America?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the decision happens generally</v>

809
00:36:03.531 --> 00:36:05.450
<v Speaker 2>people look and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

810
00:36:05.451 --> 00:36:06.500
<v Speaker 2>what foresight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

811
00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:11.990
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of this insane idea that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have a country is prosperous as</v>

812
00:36:11.991 --> 00:36:13.970
<v Speaker 2>ours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

813
00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:18.170
<v Speaker 2>with our GMP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$350 million citizens,</v>

814
00:36:18.171 --> 00:36:18.951
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have this.</v>

815
00:36:18.951 --> 00:36:23.951
<v Speaker 2>Like this thing is huge as us that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>still have and intact suite of</v>

816
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.393
<v Speaker 2>megafauna.</v>

817
00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:33.940
<v Speaker 2>No one else pulls that off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've accomplished a lot.</v>

818
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:36.800
<v Speaker 2>But then now and then people just get</v>
<v Speaker 2>pissed because they want to be able to</v>

819
00:36:36.801 --> 00:36:39.950
<v Speaker 2>do stuff while they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like interests that want to make</v>

820
00:36:39.951 --> 00:36:43.190
<v Speaker 2>money and when they want to make money</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if someone tells him no,</v>

821
00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:46.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get a little bit pissy and then the</v>

822
00:36:46.101 --> 00:36:50.120
<v Speaker 2>smart ones of them and I will know and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would never detract from their</v>

823
00:36:50.121 --> 00:36:51.800
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The smart ones have them.</v>

824
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than walking away,</v>

825
00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:55.880
<v Speaker 2>they go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

826
00:36:55.881 --> 00:37:00.320
<v Speaker 2>how is this law?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is the law this way and what can we</v>

827
00:37:00.321 --> 00:37:01.880
<v Speaker 2>do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Right now,</v>

828
00:37:01.881 --> 00:37:06.380
<v Speaker 2>those folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those folks have an idea that,</v>

829
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:09.740
<v Speaker 2>that the solution to their problem is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we would</v>

830
00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:16.250
<v Speaker 2>begin undoing the great work of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Roosevelt and Gifford Pincho and</v>

831
00:37:16.251 --> 00:37:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Aldo Leopold and all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a seminal American figures that we</v>

832
00:37:20.331 --> 00:37:23.030
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would undo their work and go back to</v>

833
00:37:23.031 --> 00:37:24.770
<v Speaker 2>a system where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

834
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:27.140
<v Speaker 2>where these landscapes are privatized</v>

835
00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:31.930
<v Speaker 1>people who've never been to yellowstone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

836
00:37:31.931 --> 00:37:33.670
<v Speaker 1>even if you're not a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

837
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:37.120
<v Speaker 1>you should go once a yellowstone anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

838
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.500
<v Speaker 1>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

839
00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.480
<v Speaker 1>I have problem with that Dan Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

840
00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:44.860
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just forget about hunting,</v>

841
00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:49.240
<v Speaker 1>just the fact that we have this immense</v>
<v Speaker 1>state park that you could go to.</v>

842
00:37:49.241 --> 00:37:52.120
<v Speaker 1>And I took my kids there this summer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

843
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:55.090
<v Speaker 1>we hung out with Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were like standing there that there was</v>

844
00:37:55.091 --> 00:37:58.480
<v Speaker 1>a buffalo that was 100 yards away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is looking at these giant,</v>

845
00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.630
<v Speaker 1>huge prehistoric animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

846
00:38:01.631 --> 00:38:04.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a great place for introductory</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildlife viewing.</v>

847
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.790
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we took a lot of selfies with elk</v>

848
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:09.220
<v Speaker 1>because the elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the wolf population has</v>

849
00:38:09.221 --> 00:38:10.900
<v Speaker 1>increased in yellowstone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elk have decided,</v>

850
00:38:10.901 --> 00:38:12.670
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one spot to hang out the fucking</v>

851
00:38:12.671 --> 00:38:13.530
<v Speaker 1>visitor center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

852
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:17.830
<v Speaker 1>So you got by the visitor center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a coca cola machine,</v>

853
00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:21.430
<v Speaker 1>is a vending machine and a right next to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vending machine.</v>

854
00:38:21.431 --> 00:38:24.430
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucking elk just chilling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just laying down there.</v>

855
00:38:24.431 --> 00:38:29.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have zero fear of people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how they become sort of</v>

856
00:38:30.431 --> 00:38:32.080
<v Speaker 1>acclimated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>habituated,</v>

857
00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.800
<v Speaker 1>betray his work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny when you look at,</v>

858
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.730
<v Speaker 2>there's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've identified it as much as I love</v>

859
00:38:39.731 --> 00:38:42.130
<v Speaker 2>yellowstone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It in my perspective that as a fellow</v>

860
00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:45.230
<v Speaker 2>that does what I do for food and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

861
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.630
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and enjoyment,</v>

862
00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:52.590
<v Speaker 2>which is to hunt A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at it from a grand wildlife thing</v>

863
00:38:52.871 --> 00:38:56.350
<v Speaker 2>and I look at it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it serves the purpose of being just like</v>

864
00:38:56.351 --> 00:38:58.480
<v Speaker 2>fantastic wildlife sanctuary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

865
00:38:58.481 --> 00:38:59.051
<v Speaker 2>and everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

866
00:38:59.051 --> 00:38:59.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

867
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:01.210
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our mutual friend Doug,</v>

868
00:39:01.211 --> 00:39:02.260
<v Speaker 2>during,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

869
00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:04.120
<v Speaker 2>even on his farm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

870
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.960
<v Speaker 2>He has established a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a sanctuary area,</v>

871
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.630
<v Speaker 2>like on his farm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place where you don't go that it's</v>

872
00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:14.290
<v Speaker 2>always a spot where we're deer go and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't get harassed in that area and</v>

873
00:39:14.291 --> 00:39:17.290
<v Speaker 2>it's like a self imposed sanctuary and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have yellowstone provides that,</v>

874
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.560
<v Speaker 2>but if identified this sorta thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

875
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:24.700
<v Speaker 2>the idea I've been working on called</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yellowstone Syndrome though is where</v>

876
00:39:24.701 --> 00:39:27.060
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans,</v>

877
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:28.210
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many of them,</v>

878
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.390
<v Speaker 2>they're only id about wildlife and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wildlife politics and wildlife</v>

879
00:39:31.391 --> 00:39:35.110
<v Speaker 2>management comes from the yellowstone</v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

880
00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:40.150
<v Speaker 2>that they wind up having a difficult</v>
<v Speaker 2>time understanding wildlife and wildlife</v>

881
00:39:40.151 --> 00:39:43.420
<v Speaker 2>management in situations that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of a national park setting,</v>

882
00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:49.240
<v Speaker 2>which is to say they don't have a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>good grasp on the inevitable conflicts</v>

883
00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:54.190
<v Speaker 2>that are going to arise between wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 2>and society.</v>

884
00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:58.120
<v Speaker 2>And that's a large chunk of ground where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just do not have those sorts of</v>

885
00:39:58.121 --> 00:39:59.950
<v Speaker 2>conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of conflicts we talking</v>

886
00:39:59.951 --> 00:40:00.551
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

887
00:40:00.551 --> 00:40:04.090
<v Speaker 2>like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thing has been very difficult and very</v>

888
00:40:04.091 --> 00:40:07.750
<v Speaker 2>vexing for wildlife managers is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to a what,</v>

889
00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:10.180
<v Speaker 2>what happens to buffalo when they leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>national?</v>

890
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:13.870
<v Speaker 2>The yellowstone national park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

891
00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:15.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tobacco on the,</v>

892
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:20.020
<v Speaker 2>on the yellowstone is she goes to get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense for how revolutionary that idea</v>

893
00:40:20.021 --> 00:40:21.580
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

894
00:40:21.581 --> 00:40:25.090
<v Speaker 2>there was the Indian wars weren't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>over when they made yellowstone.</v>

895
00:40:25.091 --> 00:40:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Yellowstone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

896
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:30.130
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were still battling American Indians</v>

897
00:40:30.131 --> 00:40:32.000
<v Speaker 2>on the Great Plains when you also want</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to affect,</v>

898
00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:35.470
<v Speaker 2>matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yellowstone was a park when the Nez</v>

899
00:40:35.471 --> 00:40:40.471
<v Speaker 2>perce were chased through by the US army</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they actually killed a couple of</v>

900
00:40:40.751 --> 00:40:44.770
<v Speaker 2>terrorists in yellowstone bright at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the buildings that are still there.</v>

901
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.450
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

902
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:51.660
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you went to and got shot by Indians who</v>

903
00:40:52.151 --> 00:40:54.790
<v Speaker 2>were engaged in a war with the US army.</v>

904
00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a,</v>

905
00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.850
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like they hadn't even,</v>

906
00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the West hadn't even been in some ways</v>

907
00:41:03.191 --> 00:41:08.191
<v Speaker 2>that the center west hadn't even been</v>
<v Speaker 2>settled and they were made and they made</v>

908
00:41:08.471 --> 00:41:10.420
<v Speaker 2>the national park and then Roosevelt</v>
<v Speaker 2>went there and uh,</v>

909
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:11.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the commemoration to like,</v>

910
00:41:11.981 --> 00:41:13.660
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

911
00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:17.540
<v Speaker 2>went there to applaud it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just get a sense of like,</v>

912
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:19.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean just it was just an outlandish</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>

913
00:41:19.861 --> 00:41:24.861
<v Speaker 2>was so far ahead of its time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with like the buffalo inch situation</v>

914
00:41:25.181 --> 00:41:26.800
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it's kind of,</v>

915
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:32.130
<v Speaker 2>how it sort of is like colored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The broader conversation would be a.</v>

916
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:36.650
<v Speaker 2>You also is one of the few places where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

917
00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:40.160
<v Speaker 2>where the animal buffalo or bison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

918
00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.260
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're lenay and name is bison.</v>

919
00:41:42.261 --> 00:41:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Bison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people say it's bison.</v>

920
00:41:44.361 --> 00:41:46.850
<v Speaker 2>Bison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bison as opposed to bison.</v>

921
00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Bison Atha backus at the baskets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a buffalo,</v>

922
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:52.930
<v Speaker 2>I call them Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ca.</v>

923
00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.400
<v Speaker 2>It's very controversial to calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not cool if you call them</v>

924
00:41:55.401 --> 00:41:56.930
<v Speaker 2>buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really know you're suppose to call them</v>

925
00:41:56.931 --> 00:42:00.950
<v Speaker 2>bison who you're hanging out with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Old timey folk.</v>

926
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:03.440
<v Speaker 2>They use coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

927
00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.041
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

928
00:42:04.041 --> 00:42:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Well Kyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's get to that in.</v>

929
00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

930
00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:12.430
<v Speaker 2>we'll call them both Dan Flores books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh you are good with that.</v>

931
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to call them bison.</v>

932
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:17.960
<v Speaker 2>What the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's [inaudible] was one of the few</v>

933
00:42:17.961 --> 00:42:21.890
<v Speaker 2>places where bison have always existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now at a time,</v>

934
00:42:21.891 --> 00:42:24.980
<v Speaker 2>the ones there were fenced and fed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've always been there.</v>

935
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:29.900
<v Speaker 2>And your then you have there is you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a genetically pure strain or there's</v>

936
00:42:29.901 --> 00:42:33.260
<v Speaker 2>been no cattle intro aggression into</v>
<v Speaker 2>those animals.</v>

937
00:42:33.261 --> 00:42:36.020
<v Speaker 2>There's only a handful of herds in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>US that were,</v>

938
00:42:36.021 --> 00:42:38.300
<v Speaker 2>there hasn't been some amount of cattle</v>
<v Speaker 2>integration.</v>

939
00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:40.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't see it usually,</v>

940
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.060
<v Speaker 2>but it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oftentimes there's some New Mexico that</v>

941
00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:46.580
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some of the Dakotas that do not</v>

942
00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:50.090
<v Speaker 2>in the yellowstone ones do not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've never interbred or bending and</v>

943
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:52.190
<v Speaker 2>interbred with cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're valuable in that way.</v>

944
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:53.840
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at various times there's,</v>

945
00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:56.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few thousand of them in the park and</v>

946
00:42:56.211 --> 00:43:00.450
<v Speaker 2>the snow's pile up and one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like to do when the snow piles up,</v>

947
00:43:00.451 --> 00:43:04.640
<v Speaker 2>so you'd like to leave the park and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd go out at West Yellowstone,</v>

948
00:43:04.641 --> 00:43:06.420
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the primary entrance</v>
<v Speaker 2>points into the,</v>

949
00:43:06.421 --> 00:43:07.810
<v Speaker 2>into the park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they'll go out and,</v>

950
00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:12.930
<v Speaker 2>and the late at the gardener entrance in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the late winter that were pro,</v>

951
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:17.510
<v Speaker 2>that would be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably maybe be kind of fun if it</v>

952
00:43:17.511 --> 00:43:18.860
<v Speaker 2>weren't for a couple of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

953
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.500
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a livestock disease called</v>

954
00:43:21.501 --> 00:43:25.700
<v Speaker 2>brucellosis and it's a year age and</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

955
00:43:25.701 --> 00:43:26.391
<v Speaker 2>So it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

956
00:43:26.391 --> 00:43:27.230
<v Speaker 2>it's a nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

957
00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know everything of diseases as</v>

958
00:43:29.061 --> 00:43:31.910
<v Speaker 2>being native or non native,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a non native disease called</v>

959
00:43:31.911 --> 00:43:36.911
<v Speaker 2>Brucellosis and brucellosis causes</v>
<v Speaker 2>cattle to it causes heifers,</v>

960
00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:38.900
<v Speaker 2>heifers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kyle.</v>

961
00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:41.270
<v Speaker 2>That's hasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

962
00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:44.870
<v Speaker 2>with just one young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So halfers a cow that said having her</v>

963
00:43:44.871 --> 00:43:49.160
<v Speaker 2>first going to have her first calf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it causes the heifers to abort their</v>

964
00:43:49.161 --> 00:43:53.810
<v Speaker 2>fetus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they've gotten brucellosis</v>

965
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:58.990
<v Speaker 2>eradicated from cattle hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally when a state is getting</v>

966
00:43:59.991 --> 00:44:02.240
<v Speaker 2>brucellosis cases they have to pay for</v>
<v Speaker 2>testing.</v>

967
00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:05.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's expensive to get all your cows</v>

968
00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:06.890
<v Speaker 2>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you have brucellosis in your</v>

969
00:44:06.891 --> 00:44:10.700
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the producers got to pay the testing to</v>

970
00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.980
<v Speaker 2>get them tested to make sure that not</v>
<v Speaker 2>brucellosis positive.</v>

971
00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:18.310
<v Speaker 2>Well cattle long ago past brucellosis to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bison on the Bison leave the park.</v>

972
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:25.150
<v Speaker 2>They carry brucellosis with them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>could reintroduce it into cattle herds</v>

973
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:28.190
<v Speaker 2>though that hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no known case of that happening.</v>

974
00:44:28.191 --> 00:44:30.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't have it spread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They well,</v>

975
00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:35.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the primary way it spread his animals</v>

976
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:38.430
<v Speaker 2>eat their own afterbirth and Lee after</v>
<v Speaker 2>birth of other animals.</v>

977
00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.760
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why the ether?</v>

978
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:44.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some folks he thrown.</v>

979
00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:46.660
<v Speaker 2>I proposed that to my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was not down with it at all,</v>

980
00:44:46.661 --> 00:44:49.000
<v Speaker 2>but I've got friends that take their</v>
<v Speaker 2>placenta.</v>

981
00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:53.230
<v Speaker 2>I got some buddies that had their wives</v>
<v Speaker 2>placentas made into pills.</v>

982
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Pills?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

983
00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:57.220
<v Speaker 2>There's some gal that dries it up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts it in capsules for you.</v>

984
00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I've heard of people cooking it with</v>
<v Speaker 2>carrots.</v>

985
00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to cook some man,</v>

986
00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.260
<v Speaker 2>but their thing is when my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

987
00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:06.390
<v Speaker 2>I swore up and down like I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink the breast milk,</v>

988
00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a body to put breast milk in</v>

989
00:45:08.621 --> 00:45:09.940
<v Speaker 2>his coffee and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

990
00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:13.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do to nea and I couldn't go near.</v>

991
00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Does he wear a diaper to know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's like,</v>

992
00:45:15.311 --> 00:45:17.380
<v Speaker 2>he'll go if he's going to have coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

993
00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:19.870
<v Speaker 2>w when women are breastfeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have little bottles in the fridge</v>

994
00:45:19.871 --> 00:45:20.540
<v Speaker 2>and everything.</v>

995
00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:21.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just go in there,</v>

996
00:45:21.251 --> 00:45:22.960
<v Speaker 2>grab one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it in his coffee and cheese.</v>

997
00:45:22.961 --> 00:45:25.660
<v Speaker 2>It's just drink it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried it just to taste,</v>

998
00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:27.700
<v Speaker 2>but I felt like I was stealing from my</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

999
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.080
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I was being a cannibal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one thing that's my.</v>

1000
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:34.270
<v Speaker 2>That's where I draw a line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you draw the line.</v>

1001
00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:35.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ate a monkey.</v>

1002
00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know and I felt horrible.</v>

1003
00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Did you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1004
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I felt real bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well not so bad.</v>

1005
00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:40.880
<v Speaker 2>I didn't eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

1006
00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.750
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like emotionally complicated for</v>

1007
00:45:43.751 --> 00:45:44.561
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

1008
00:45:44.561 --> 00:45:46.510
<v Speaker 2>So we'll get back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1009
00:45:46.511 --> 00:45:48.960
<v Speaker 2>The brucellosis deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get.</v>

1010
00:45:48.961 --> 00:45:51.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to excel in yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to explain like yellowstone</v>

1011
00:45:51.311 --> 00:45:52.860
<v Speaker 2>syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the bruise,</v>

1012
00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:56.050
<v Speaker 2>the lowest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The steel is a real issue for some</v>

1013
00:45:56.051 --> 00:45:59.800
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it conceivably a buffalo could leave</v>

1014
00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:01.720
<v Speaker 2>yellowstone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give birth.</v>

1015
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:04.480
<v Speaker 2>The afterbirth could be their cow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could eat that after birth can get blue</v>

1016
00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:07.570
<v Speaker 2>brucellosis and like everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like everything we're talking about,</v>

1017
00:46:07.571 --> 00:46:11.830
<v Speaker 2>this is so there's so many caveats and</v>
<v Speaker 2>complications and things such as elk</v>

1018
00:46:11.831 --> 00:46:14.560
<v Speaker 2>have brucellosis but outcome and go as</v>
<v Speaker 2>they please.</v>

1019
00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the minute a buffalo or bison,</v>

1020
00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:20.800
<v Speaker 2>when he leaves Yellowstone National</v>
<v Speaker 2>Park,</v>

1021
00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:24.940
<v Speaker 2>if he walks into Montana now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even fenced,</v>

1022
00:46:24.941 --> 00:46:26.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like he doesn't know,</v>

1023
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:31.820
<v Speaker 2>but when he crosses the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes from being a wild animal,</v>

1024
00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:34.920
<v Speaker 2>from being native wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1025
00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.400
<v Speaker 2>To being livestock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he goes from being the property of</v>

1026
00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:43.780
<v Speaker 2>like under the administration of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>National Park Service to the</v>

1027
00:46:43.781 --> 00:46:46.720
<v Speaker 2>administration of Montana's Department</v>
<v Speaker 2>of livestock.</v>

1028
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Native animal.</v>

1029
00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Now she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does that work though,</v>

1030
00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.280
<v Speaker 2>if the native animal crosses over onto</v>
<v Speaker 2>private property is the only.</v>

1031
00:46:54.281 --> 00:46:58.150
<v Speaker 2>He's the only animal that happens too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So coyotes,</v>

1032
00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:59.620
<v Speaker 2>Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wolverines,</v>

1033
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:00.940
<v Speaker 2>grizzly bears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black bears,</v>

1034
00:47:00.941 --> 00:47:02.650
<v Speaker 2>bighorn sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elk,</v>

1035
00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.600
<v Speaker 2>mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white tail deer,</v>

1036
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:05.463
<v Speaker 2>Moose.</v>

1037
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:11.840
<v Speaker 2>They leave their wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buffalo leaves.</v>

1038
00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:15.950
<v Speaker 2>He becomes errant livestock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1039
00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every year there's a,</v>

1040
00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:19.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a perennial story every year</v>

1041
00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:25.070
<v Speaker 2>where a bunch of buffalo leave the park</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get rounded up by the Department of</v>

1042
00:47:25.071 --> 00:47:28.430
<v Speaker 2>livestock and sent to quarantine are</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually sent off to slaughter.</v>

1043
00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just killed a bunch of them.</v>

1044
00:47:30.161 --> 00:47:31.750
<v Speaker 2>They killed like 2000 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man,</v>

1045
00:47:31.751 --> 00:47:32.584
<v Speaker 2>they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get a lot of them.</v>

1046
00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:34.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1047
00:47:34.181 --> 00:47:35.770
<v Speaker 2>that plays cranks out a lot of animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1048
00:47:35.771 --> 00:47:38.350
<v Speaker 2>So it's like they're always throwing out</v>
<v Speaker 2>these humongous numbers of animals</v>

1049
00:47:38.351 --> 00:47:40.810
<v Speaker 2>they've gotten in and every year you</v>
<v Speaker 2>wind up having quite a few animals in</v>

1050
00:47:40.811 --> 00:47:41.644
<v Speaker 2>the park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1051
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:45.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a thing now people point out</v>

1052
00:47:45.251 --> 00:47:50.251
<v Speaker 2>this because elk have brucellosis in elk</v>
<v Speaker 2>are calving in proximity to cattle and</v>

1053
00:47:52.971 --> 00:47:56.680
<v Speaker 2>there and as far as we know that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like all your in class cases of</v>

1054
00:47:56.681 --> 00:48:00.340
<v Speaker 2>cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of elk transmitting brucellosis to</v>

1055
00:48:00.341 --> 00:48:00.910
<v Speaker 2>cattle.</v>

1056
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:03.250
<v Speaker 2>People wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why are bison picked on?</v>

1057
00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:04.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why them.</v>

1058
00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:07.840
<v Speaker 2>And one thing might be to say that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>got,</v>

1059
00:48:07.841 --> 00:48:09.790
<v Speaker 2>and this is generally true of wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 2>in America,</v>

1060
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a brief period around</v>
<v Speaker 2>1900 when we had,</v>

1061
00:48:15.371 --> 00:48:18.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe about 75 of them left in the US.</v>

1062
00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:23.880
<v Speaker 2>People got very used to their sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not being Buffalo Bison.</v>

1063
00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:29.610
<v Speaker 2>And now this becoming like an a player</v>
<v Speaker 2>again is the,</v>

1064
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.360
<v Speaker 2>the animals becoming a player again that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we now have.</v>

1065
00:48:31.361 --> 00:48:35.410
<v Speaker 2>We were down to 75.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got 500,000 in the US now.</v>

1066
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Ninety four percent of them are</v>
<v Speaker 2>privately owned,</v>

1067
00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:41.530
<v Speaker 2>but we have a population of a half</v>
<v Speaker 2>million buffalo in his country.</v>

1068
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1069
00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:46.150
<v Speaker 2>But we got really used to them not being</v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

1070
00:48:46.151 --> 00:48:48.220
<v Speaker 2>And so it was this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like this additive thing.</v>

1071
00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Like I think if there had been a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>period when there were no elk.</v>

1072
00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.080
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1073
00:48:53.081 --> 00:48:55.780
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're bringing these big ass ungulates</v>

1074
00:48:55.781 --> 00:49:00.781
<v Speaker 2>back the eat tons of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're huge and they might have a</v>

1075
00:49:01.241 --> 00:49:05.590
<v Speaker 2>disease and we're just going to let tens</v>
<v Speaker 2>of thousands of them cut loose across</v>

1076
00:49:05.591 --> 00:49:07.000
<v Speaker 2>the landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been up in arms,</v>

1077
00:49:07.001 --> 00:49:09.310
<v Speaker 2>but they were used to it because elk are</v>
<v Speaker 2>always on the ground.</v>

1078
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:12.120
<v Speaker 2>So that's why buffalo recovery has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>so hard because it's kind,</v>

1079
00:49:12.121 --> 00:49:14.470
<v Speaker 2>kinda like you're trying to sell people</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this new thing,</v>

1080
00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:17.560
<v Speaker 2>even though historically it's hardly new</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been around,</v>

1081
00:49:17.561 --> 00:49:19.210
<v Speaker 2>but there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a period of,</v>

1082
00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:21.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>

1083
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:22.960
<v Speaker 2>not quite a century when it wasn't an</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

1084
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:27.990
<v Speaker 2>So it's really hard to get livestock</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest and private land owners around</v>

1085
00:49:28.571 --> 00:49:33.100
<v Speaker 2>these areas to unanimously get on board</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the idea that we're gonna have</v>

1086
00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:36.460
<v Speaker 2>animals roaming out of the park that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1087
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:41.550
<v Speaker 2>has been proven to happen that will get</v>
<v Speaker 2>into your corral and kill your horse or,</v>

1088
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:47.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take out a school bus if it hits them or</v>

1089
00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:49.480
<v Speaker 2>possibly transmit disease.</v>

1090
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.210
<v Speaker 2>And the big thing that people don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really talk about but which is a huge</v>

1091
00:49:52.211 --> 00:49:55.180
<v Speaker 2>issue is um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impact grazing rights,</v>

1092
00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.160
<v Speaker 2>impact cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cattle grazing,</v>

1093
00:49:57.161 --> 00:50:01.510
<v Speaker 2>get back to kill the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had a gore that Gore stuff,</v>

1094
00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:04.120
<v Speaker 2>they just go into the horse of stable</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fuck them out.</v>

1095
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:07.360
<v Speaker 2>It's happened when they run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they run crazy.</v>

1096
00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wrote in the summer and in the</v>

1097
00:50:09.191 --> 00:50:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Bulls get very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get real fired up and then,</v>

1098
00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:14.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing there too with,</v>

1099
00:50:14.531 --> 00:50:16.750
<v Speaker 2>with the yellowstone ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with animals that are</v>

1100
00:50:16.751 --> 00:50:18.280
<v Speaker 2>habituated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's only been like,</v>

1101
00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:19.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been 100 years that you can't.</v>

1102
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:20.950
<v Speaker 2>You haven't been able to hunt in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>park.</v>

1103
00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:23.080
<v Speaker 2>The animals have gotten habituated to</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

1104
00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:26.020
<v Speaker 2>We like to look at yellowstone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think you're seeing something kind of</v>

1105
00:50:26.021 --> 00:50:27.440
<v Speaker 2>natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're actually seeing something</v>

1106
00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:31.930
<v Speaker 2>pretty unnatural because that landscape</v>
<v Speaker 2>was hunted for 12,000 years the last</v>

1107
00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:33.260
<v Speaker 2>hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not withstanding.</v>

1108
00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.570
<v Speaker 5>So the he wrote always hunted</v>
<v Speaker 5>yellowstone.</v>

1109
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:38.360
<v Speaker 5>The unnatural thing is these animals are</v>
<v Speaker 5>super comfortable.</v>

1110
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:41.660
<v Speaker 5>Being habituated to humans is unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we go there and be like,</v>

1111
00:50:41.661 --> 00:50:43.010
<v Speaker 5>this is what animals were like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1112
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.520
<v Speaker 5>not if you draw a line back to when</v>
<v Speaker 5>humans arrived in the new world.</v>

1113
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.590
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was one of the more fascinating</v>

1114
00:50:48.591 --> 00:50:53.570
<v Speaker 5>things about Dan Flores on your podcast</v>
<v Speaker 5>where he was talking about buffalo and</v>

1115
00:50:53.571 --> 00:50:58.571
<v Speaker 5>that at one point in time the Indians or</v>
<v Speaker 5>the native Americans when they had guns</v>

1116
00:50:59.151 --> 00:51:03.020
<v Speaker 5>and they had horses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were on their way to extra painting</v>

1117
00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:04.660
<v Speaker 5>the buffalo on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1118
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.500
<v Speaker 5>Before the market hunters came into</v>
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

1119
00:51:06.501 --> 00:51:08.720
<v Speaker 5>That's an incredibly controversial idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a.</v>

1120
00:51:08.721 --> 00:51:10.190
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was a controversial idea.</v>

1121
00:51:10.191 --> 00:51:14.960
<v Speaker 5>Now is put for again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not I talk in my book that I wrote,</v>

1122
00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:17.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a book of American Buffalo about,</v>

1123
00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:19.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the history of the animal and,</v>

1124
00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:22.400
<v Speaker 2>and in my own personal experiences is</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting for the animal and finding a</v>

1125
00:51:22.401 --> 00:51:25.520
<v Speaker 2>skull of one that I found that absorb a</v>
<v Speaker 2>journey that led me down.</v>

1126
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:29.570
<v Speaker 2>But in working on that book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent a quiet time reading the work of</v>

1127
00:51:29.571 --> 00:51:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Dan Flores and he was a mentor of mine</v>
<v Speaker 2>in graduate school and he,</v>

1128
00:51:33.301 --> 00:51:37.350
<v Speaker 2>and he wrote this a very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece called Bison Ecology Bison</v>

1129
00:51:37.351 --> 00:51:40.430
<v Speaker 2>diplomacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he looked at was he was trying</v>

1130
00:51:40.431 --> 00:51:41.600
<v Speaker 2>to find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was there a period when,</v>

1131
00:51:41.601 --> 00:51:45.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when plains tribes.</v>

1132
00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was there a period when native Americans</v>

1133
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:53.560
<v Speaker 2>had actually reached equilibrium with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bison herds and,</v>

1134
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:57.890
<v Speaker 2>and he argued that there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1135
00:51:57.910 --> 00:52:00.480
<v Speaker 2>that they had not achieved equilibrium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1136
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:05.530
<v Speaker 2>that even if that one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the points he makes many points</v>

1137
00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:06.770
<v Speaker 2>this thing out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to sell.</v>

1138
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:08.140
<v Speaker 2>This is pete short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1139
00:52:08.141 --> 00:52:10.910
<v Speaker 2>it's a very large piece of scholarly</v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

1140
00:52:10.911 --> 00:52:14.870
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things he talks about is</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the introduction of the horse</v>

1141
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:21.590
<v Speaker 2>had humongous impacts on the animals on</v>
<v Speaker 2>buffalo for a handful of reasons.</v>

1142
00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Grazing competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1143
00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:27.770
<v Speaker 2>So enormous hort herds of wild horses</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the horse was distributed.</v>

1144
00:52:27.771 --> 00:52:30.700
<v Speaker 2>So you traced in flurries explains all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this as well.</v>

1145
00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:34.610
<v Speaker 2>You can trace horses in to native</v>
<v Speaker 2>American tribes on the Great Plains and</v>

1146
00:52:34.611 --> 00:52:36.980
<v Speaker 2>elsewhere they go back to the Pueblo</v>
<v Speaker 2>revolt.</v>

1147
00:52:36.981 --> 00:52:40.100
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Spanish can keep the doors last lot</v>

1148
00:52:40.101 --> 00:52:45.101
<v Speaker 2>of their animals and the animals are</v>
<v Speaker 2>traded up the east earned face and up</v>

1149
00:52:45.111 --> 00:52:47.840
<v Speaker 2>the western face to the rockies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we're distributed all around.</v>

1150
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:50.810
<v Speaker 2>And so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get this idea in your head of</v>

1151
00:52:50.811 --> 00:52:51.540
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>

1152
00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:56.540
<v Speaker 2>of a plains warrior right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mounted on horseback hunting for</v>

1153
00:52:57.021 --> 00:53:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a very distinct phenomenon that</v>

1154
00:53:01.221 --> 00:53:04.580
<v Speaker 2>didn't last</v>
<v Speaker 2>nearly.</v>

1155
00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:07.670
<v Speaker 2>It didn't last as long as the US has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been a country</v>

1156
00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:14.330
<v Speaker 2>like it did not last long between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>introduction of the horse and the Indian</v>

1157
00:53:15.161 --> 00:53:15.994
<v Speaker 2>wars</v>

1158
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:18.110
<v Speaker 2>they want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like largely,</v>

1159
00:53:18.111 --> 00:53:20.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>re removing free roaming,</v>

1160
00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:24.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomous tribes off off the great</v>

1161
00:53:24.771 --> 00:53:26.730
<v Speaker 2>plains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just didn't last that long even</v>

1162
00:53:26.731 --> 00:53:30.840
<v Speaker 2>though it became like the iconic image</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the mountain plains hunter.</v>

1163
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:35.010
<v Speaker 2>And what he argues is the advent of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>horse changed hunting practices.</v>

1164
00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:39.150
<v Speaker 2>So much up until that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had tribes that were,</v>

1165
00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:44.370
<v Speaker 2>were partially or largely agrarian</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out of the Mississippi River</v>

1166
00:53:44.371 --> 00:53:48.030
<v Speaker 2>valley out of the Missouri River valley</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would grow crops.</v>

1167
00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:50.400
<v Speaker 2>And they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the summer when the buffalo herds</v>

1168
00:53:50.401 --> 00:53:53.190
<v Speaker 2>were gathered into tremendous gatherings</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the breeding season,</v>

1169
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:56.970
<v Speaker 2>they would do trips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would do buffalo hunting trips.</v>

1170
00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:00.950
<v Speaker 2>Once they had the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had all these cultures turn into</v>

1171
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:05.960
<v Speaker 2>nomadic cultures that could have a troy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a horse and just follow the hurts</v>

1172
00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:11.070
<v Speaker 2>and it was a tremendous amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure put on these animals to support</v>

1173
00:54:11.071 --> 00:54:16.071
<v Speaker 2>that amount where you had tribes</v>
<v Speaker 2>migrating out onto the great plains and</v>

1174
00:54:16.681 --> 00:54:21.681
<v Speaker 2>fighting over those resources and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think believe was one of his graduate</v>

1175
00:54:21.691 --> 00:54:25.800
<v Speaker 2>students later looked at this piece</v>
<v Speaker 2>where when Lewis and Clark did their big</v>

1176
00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:28.260
<v Speaker 2>westward journey in the early 18</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds,</v>

1177
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:31.290
<v Speaker 2>the places where they talked about</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing the greatest amounts where they</v>

1178
00:54:31.291 --> 00:54:33.720
<v Speaker 2>were just blown away by how many buffalo</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're seeing.</v>

1179
00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:39.020
<v Speaker 2>We're generally fa fell upon sort of no</v>
<v Speaker 2>man's lands areas between warring</v>

1180
00:54:40.861 --> 00:54:44.160
<v Speaker 2>tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the buffers of zone,</v>

1181
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:48.390
<v Speaker 2>the buffers of traditional hunting zones</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where the blackfeet and the Su met</v>

1182
00:54:48.391 --> 00:54:52.920
<v Speaker 2>up the edge habitat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was where you had a lot of animals</v>

1183
00:54:52.921 --> 00:54:54.390
<v Speaker 2>that weren't getting exploited by</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1184
00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:58.440
<v Speaker 2>So you started to see these like</v>
<v Speaker 2>regional extra patients of the animal</v>

1185
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:03.330
<v Speaker 2>and then firearms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was another big blow where even</v>

1186
00:55:03.331 --> 00:55:05.520
<v Speaker 2>outside of white hide hunters just</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing up,</v>

1187
00:55:05.521 --> 00:55:06.360
<v Speaker 2>but just those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

1188
00:55:06.361 --> 00:55:09.990
<v Speaker 2>those European technologies of horse</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun.</v>

1189
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:14.090
<v Speaker 2>You were seeing a a steady depletion</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would have not been in.</v>

1190
00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.490
<v Speaker 2>It seems like the resource would not</v>
<v Speaker 2>have lasted and you'd had the same</v>

1191
00:55:17.491 --> 00:55:20.520
<v Speaker 2>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was interesting about his paper was</v>

1192
00:55:20.521 --> 00:55:25.230
<v Speaker 2>that he was saying that the early</v>
<v Speaker 2>settlers or the early explorers of the</v>

1193
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:27.750
<v Speaker 2>United States in the 15 and 16 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't talk about Buffalo,</v>

1194
00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:33.540
<v Speaker 2>so when the Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Spanish would go through places and</v>

1195
00:55:33.541 --> 00:55:34.020
<v Speaker 2>they would.</v>

1196
00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:37.740
<v Speaker 2>They would name wildlife now like some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Spanish came through,</v>

1197
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:40.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go through the entire Florida.</v>

1198
00:55:40.681 --> 00:55:42.150
<v Speaker 2>Some of the first guys have stepped foot</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Florida.</v>

1199
00:55:42.151 --> 00:55:44.310
<v Speaker 2>They talked about everything they see</v>
<v Speaker 2>right down to possums.</v>

1200
00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:49.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not describing buffalo though.</v>

1201
00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:54.060
<v Speaker 2>They're describing everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The English going there 200 years later</v>

1202
00:55:54.061 --> 00:55:57.720
<v Speaker 2>and they're talking about buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's sightings in what's now new</v>

1203
00:55:57.721 --> 00:56:02.370
<v Speaker 2>orleans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cabeza de Vaca ran into buffalo around</v>

1204
00:56:02.371 --> 00:56:05.340
<v Speaker 2>what's now Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's sightings of buffalo in what is</v>

1205
00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:09.330
<v Speaker 2>now Washington DC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simon Kenton and Daniel Boone figures</v>

1206
00:56:09.331 --> 00:56:13.590
<v Speaker 2>like that were hunting them around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>site of Nashville and Memphis.</v>

1207
00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:18.000
<v Speaker 2>They were all way to the east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems there are only a handful of</v>

1208
00:56:18.001 --> 00:56:20.490
<v Speaker 2>states that at some point in time didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have any.</v>

1209
00:56:20.491 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 2>My home state of Michigan doesn't seem</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there were any for a long time.</v>

1210
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:28.150
<v Speaker 2>People thought that there had been</v>
<v Speaker 2>buffalo in New York,</v>

1211
00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:33.130
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out the the evidence for</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and the paleontological and</v>

1212
00:56:33.131 --> 00:56:35.320
<v Speaker 2>archeological record is two skulls.</v>

1213
00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Both the schools have cultural markings</v>
<v Speaker 2>on them and it seems that they were the</v>

1214
00:56:40.001 --> 00:56:44.890
<v Speaker 2>same way that that mean in in Joe here</v>
<v Speaker 2>will like hunt an animal and bring the</v>

1215
00:56:44.891 --> 00:56:48.400
<v Speaker 2>head home that they might've been just</v>
<v Speaker 2>things someone had trophies that were</v>

1216
00:56:48.401 --> 00:56:51.190
<v Speaker 2>traded or whatever because there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>other phone will remain from the animals</v>

1217
00:56:51.191 --> 00:56:52.550
<v Speaker 2>in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most places had them.</v>

1218
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Now the mound builders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have all these like mississippian</v>

1219
00:56:56.371 --> 00:56:58.060
<v Speaker 2>culture is along the Mississippi River</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Ohio.</v>

1220
00:56:58.061 --> 00:56:59.530
<v Speaker 2>River valley is called the mountain</v>
<v Speaker 2>boulders.</v>

1221
00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:03.340
<v Speaker 2>They made these giant effigy mounds that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people didn't even realize they were</v>

1222
00:57:03.341 --> 00:57:08.341
<v Speaker 2>there until we had airplanes to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>above and see the snakes and serpents</v>

1223
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:12.670
<v Speaker 2>and deer and all these creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were building out our earth mounds</v>

1224
00:57:12.671 --> 00:57:15.280
<v Speaker 2>that were so big that guys would like</v>
<v Speaker 2>live around the mountain and never</v>

1225
00:57:15.281 --> 00:57:17.980
<v Speaker 2>recognize it for what it was until they</v>
<v Speaker 2>could look at it from above.</v>

1226
00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:20.290
<v Speaker 2>You can see these things with satellite</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagery.</v>

1227
00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:25.740
<v Speaker 2>They never built buffalo mounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once we emptied,</v>

1228
00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:29.740
<v Speaker 2>and this is one argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a Tupac argument,</v>

1229
00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:36.010
<v Speaker 2>once smallpox and other diseases carried</v>
<v Speaker 2>off 90 percent of native Americans,</v>

1230
00:57:36.011 --> 00:57:37.690
<v Speaker 2>90.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an estimate.</v>

1231
00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.310
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many people say that.</v>

1232
00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:41.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a.</v>

1233
00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:44.080
<v Speaker 2>I think like the scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consensus is that it's,</v>

1234
00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:47.050
<v Speaker 2>that it's in that ballpark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the numbers?</v>

1235
00:57:47.051 --> 00:57:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Do they estimate the actual physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers?</v>

1236
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:49.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it,</v>

1237
00:57:49.961 --> 00:57:52.300
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there was a number that was</v>

1238
00:57:52.301 --> 00:57:54.370
<v Speaker 2>floating around for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 million,</v>

1239
00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:58.780
<v Speaker 2>but I remember a lot of people criticize</v>
<v Speaker 2>that number as being high.</v>

1240
00:57:58.781 --> 00:58:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fashionable number</v>
<v Speaker 2>is now,</v>

1241
00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:04.990
<v Speaker 2>but 90 percent approximately why</v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases diseases from the Europeans and</v>

1242
00:58:04.991 --> 00:58:09.860
<v Speaker 2>that this was primarily responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 2>this explosion in the population,</v>

1243
00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:10.570
<v Speaker 2>the Buffalo.</v>

1244
00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:14.050
<v Speaker 2>So that's why when the Spanish would go</v>
<v Speaker 2>into places,</v>

1245
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:18.190
<v Speaker 2>this is a theory now the Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to places first contact,</v>

1246
00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:20.200
<v Speaker 2>like first peoples traipse through an</v>
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>

1247
00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:24.010
<v Speaker 2>they would go into places and they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>described village after village,</v>

1248
00:58:24.011 --> 00:58:25.840
<v Speaker 2>after village,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after village.</v>

1249
00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they never talked about buffalo to</v>

1250
00:58:30.131 --> 00:58:32.770
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While later they'll go down,</v>

1251
00:58:32.771 --> 00:58:34.480
<v Speaker 2>someone guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go down the Mississippi river,</v>

1252
00:58:34.481 --> 00:58:35.890
<v Speaker 2>he knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see shit for people.</v>

1253
00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:39.130
<v Speaker 2>But it was buffalo crawling everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1254
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:40.830
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and another issue,</v>

1255
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:43.630
<v Speaker 2>another thing people talk about is</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing agricultural practices that</v>

1256
00:58:43.631 --> 00:58:48.631
<v Speaker 2>slash and burn agriculture was becoming</v>
<v Speaker 2>a used and slash and burn agriculture</v>

1257
00:58:49.091 --> 00:58:50.360
<v Speaker 2>was conducive to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1258
00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:52.320
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spreading to.</v>

1259
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:55.810
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't conducive to buffalo because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it created open spaces for them.</v>

1260
00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.600
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing people look at is</v>
<v Speaker 2>slash and burn agriculture.</v>

1261
00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:03.601
<v Speaker 2>But either way it's proposed that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>apex of</v>

1262
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:10.950
<v Speaker 2>that species was at the moment we found</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fashionable number used to be $60</v>

1263
00:59:13.091 --> 00:59:13.924
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>

1264
00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.780
<v Speaker 2>that was put forth by a guy named,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1265
00:59:16.781 --> 00:59:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Dodge city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dodge city,</v>

1266
00:59:19.271 --> 00:59:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Kansas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got His name from a guy named Colonel</v>

1267
00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Dodge,</v>

1268
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:23.840
<v Speaker 3>Colonel Dodge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see,</v>

1269
00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:26.090
<v Speaker 3>if you're interested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could explain how he came up with it,</v>

1270
00:59:26.091 --> 00:59:29.150
<v Speaker 3>but Colonel Dodge is the one that</v>
<v Speaker 3>floated the idea that there were 60</v>

1271
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:32.870
<v Speaker 3>million buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now the fashionable number is,</v>

1272
00:59:32.871 --> 00:59:34.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>32 years,</v>

1273
00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.980
<v Speaker 3>$32,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million or 40 million and people say</v>

1274
00:59:36.981 --> 00:59:41.030
<v Speaker 3>that that was that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was an extraordinary amount of</v>

1275
00:59:41.031 --> 00:59:46.031
<v Speaker 3>those animals and we witnessed it at its</v>
<v Speaker 3>apex and that at other times in the</v>

1276
00:59:47.301 --> 00:59:50.210
<v Speaker 3>history of the continent and other times</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the natural history of our</v>

1277
00:59:50.211 --> 00:59:51.770
<v Speaker 3>continent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there weren't nearly that many of the</v>

1278
00:59:51.771 --> 00:59:52.604
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

1279
00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating concept and I never had</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard it before.</v>

1280
00:59:57.330 --> 01:00:00.960
<v Speaker 1>I'd only heard that there was a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers of them and that the Europeans</v>

1281
01:00:00.961 --> 01:00:05.330
<v Speaker 1>came over and Americans wiped them out</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we wanted the skulls and the for</v>

1282
01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:05.690
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

1283
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:09.230
<v Speaker 3>We wiped out the tail end of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you get to like the end of the</v>

1284
01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:12.440
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you get to the end of the civil</v>

1285
01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.050
<v Speaker 3>war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know at that point there's maybe $15</v>

1286
01:00:16.051 --> 01:00:18.710
<v Speaker 3>million and that's when it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was in 18,</v>

1287
01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:23.720
<v Speaker 3>71 and 1872 that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you might call the commercial scale</v>

1288
01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:31.370
<v Speaker 3>harvest of the animals happened and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in the south,</v>

1289
01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:34.180
<v Speaker 3>what was called the southern herd around</v>
<v Speaker 3>1871,</v>

1290
01:00:34.181 --> 01:00:37.820
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>72 and the area surrounding dodge city</v>

1291
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:42.850
<v Speaker 3>where there's a large population of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it took 10 years by 18,</v>

1292
01:00:44.091 --> 01:00:45.200
<v Speaker 3>82.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't find one.</v>

1293
01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:48.370
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the last big slaughter happened</v>

1294
01:00:48.371 --> 01:00:51.410
<v Speaker 3>around mile city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Montana and it happened when the</v>

1295
01:00:51.411 --> 01:00:52.970
<v Speaker 3>railroad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the railroad,</v>

1296
01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:56.360
<v Speaker 3>made it to mile city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The northern Pacific made it to mile</v>

1297
01:00:56.361 --> 01:01:01.310
<v Speaker 3>city and and provided a way to get hides</v>
<v Speaker 3>the market and they did the last big</v>

1298
01:01:01.311 --> 01:01:03.290
<v Speaker 3>kill there and killed about a million of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them up there.</v>

1299
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:08.770
<v Speaker 3>And then a year later Roosevelt came out</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Madora North Dakota there</v>

1300
01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:13.670
<v Speaker 3>thereabouts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hired a guide in scoured the countryside</v>

1301
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:18.110
<v Speaker 3>hunting through the carcasses of riding</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>

1302
01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.530
<v Speaker 3>trying to find one last one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1303
01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.990
<v Speaker 3>So they could save him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1304
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.240
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to get one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was his epiphany.</v>

1305
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.370
<v Speaker 3>He got to think about that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He kills one and does a war dance around</v>

1306
01:01:31.371 --> 01:01:34.010
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of dances that I don't know,</v>

1307
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:36.950
<v Speaker 3>I've always heard described as a war</v>
<v Speaker 3>dance who didn't Holler and dancing</v>

1308
01:01:36.951 --> 01:01:38.370
<v Speaker 3>around like a hunting show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1309
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:45.010
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then whatever kind of effect it had</v>

1310
01:01:45.381 --> 01:01:47.780
<v Speaker 3>on him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he then went and became the most</v>

1311
01:01:47.781 --> 01:01:50.780
<v Speaker 3>influential conservation is we've ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>had in this country.</v>

1312
01:01:50.781 --> 01:01:53.360
<v Speaker 3>So it struck him somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as a young man,</v>

1313
01:01:53.361 --> 01:01:54.051
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

1314
01:01:54.051 --> 01:01:55.550
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I missed it.</v>

1315
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.730
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be one left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you found one.</v>

1316
01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:02.660
<v Speaker 3>He caught one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed the Montana North Dakota border</v>

1317
01:02:02.661 --> 01:02:04.000
<v Speaker 3>there and then.</v>

1318
01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.890
<v Speaker 3>And then went on to do all these kinds</v>
<v Speaker 3>of amazing things.</v>

1319
01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.020
<v Speaker 3>But that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the,</v>

1320
01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:11.290
<v Speaker 3>that was the big slaughter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's cool about that?</v>

1321
01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:14.120
<v Speaker 3>The time that worked out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his photography was just coming out.</v>

1322
01:02:14.121 --> 01:02:16.790
<v Speaker 3>People were starting to have portable</v>
<v Speaker 3>cameras and there's a photographer named</v>

1323
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:20.700
<v Speaker 3>La Hoffman had been sent out to miles</v>
<v Speaker 3>city and he actually took a lot of</v>

1324
01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:25.730
<v Speaker 3>images of those hide hunters working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last big hurt,</v>

1325
01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:29.760
<v Speaker 3>the last big shoot 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then shortly after that there was</v>

1326
01:02:29.761 --> 01:02:31.930
<v Speaker 3>some number animals left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1327
01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.390
<v Speaker 3>and they lead a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1328
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:35.350
<v Speaker 3>they a lot of bunch of plains Indians</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1329
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:38.280
<v Speaker 3>to leave one of the reservations and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went and did a little bit of a mop</v>

1330
01:02:38.281 --> 01:02:39.180
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>

1331
01:02:39.181 --> 01:02:40.030
<v Speaker 3>Then shortly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1332
01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.920
<v Speaker 3>shortly thereafter there was a guy named</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hornaday who was kind of writing letters</v>

1333
01:02:43.921 --> 01:02:46.680
<v Speaker 3>around trying to find out who had one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things laying around because</v>

1334
01:02:46.681 --> 01:02:49.140
<v Speaker 3>they'd all fallen into private hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1335
01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:52.320
<v Speaker 3>there's guys like buffalo hunters would</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill them and they'd be like,</v>

1336
01:02:52.321 --> 01:02:55.170
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like none left.</v>

1337
01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:56.940
<v Speaker 3>And some of these guys actually went out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and caught a couple.</v>

1338
01:02:56.941 --> 01:03:00.930
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy named Buffalo Jones down</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Texas that went out last,</v>

1339
01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:03.420
<v Speaker 3>sold a couple calves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>raised them on a cow's milk.</v>

1340
01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:06.480
<v Speaker 3>And that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why we even have some now.</v>

1341
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Now it turns out no one knew this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it turns out there was several</v>

1342
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.850
<v Speaker 3>hundred in Canada that no one knew</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1343
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:13.950
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know about until much,</v>

1344
01:03:13.951 --> 01:03:15.600
<v Speaker 3>much later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how'd they get to Mexico?</v>

1345
01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they probably always roamed in New</v>

1346
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1347
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:25.590
<v Speaker 3>the first buffalo the European ever laid</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes on was in Mexico,</v>

1348
01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.440
<v Speaker 3>now Mexico City,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was in,</v>

1349
01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:29.940
<v Speaker 3>it was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1350
01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.450
<v Speaker 3>who is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is the,</v>

1351
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:33.930
<v Speaker 3>the emperor there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1352
01:03:33.931 --> 01:03:36.540
<v Speaker 3>a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

1353
01:03:36.541 --> 01:03:37.540
<v Speaker 3>What was that dude's name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1354
01:03:37.541 --> 01:03:42.541
<v Speaker 3>the Aztec leader in Mexico to notch to</v>
<v Speaker 3>notch lawn was [inaudible].</v>

1355
01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:48.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm Kevin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What years?</v>

1356
01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.280
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about know in the 15</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds.</v>

1357
01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:54.090
<v Speaker 3>Cortez found one in Mexico City,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was in a zoo.</v>

1358
01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:56.580
<v Speaker 3>Montezuma?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try saying that.</v>

1359
01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.770
<v Speaker 3>The city of topnotch salon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1360
01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:03.120
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So which is in which is now Mexico City.</v>

1361
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had,</v>

1362
01:04:05.521 --> 01:04:09.180
<v Speaker 3>he had one in a zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the first one described by</v>

1363
01:04:09.181 --> 01:04:10.350
<v Speaker 3>European.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1364
01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:12.900
<v Speaker 3>But he was hundreds of miles away from</v>
<v Speaker 3>their native range.</v>

1365
01:04:12.901 --> 01:04:14.430
<v Speaker 3>They just had one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as he had all kinds.</v>

1366
01:04:14.431 --> 01:04:17.010
<v Speaker 3>He had a menagerie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had all kinds of animals that he</v>

1367
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.830
<v Speaker 3>collected from throughout their domains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was the first one described by</v>

1368
01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:24.000
<v Speaker 3>European,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't realize that the time that</v>

1369
01:04:24.001 --> 01:04:27.480
<v Speaker 3>it was from far north of there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they did stray down into the,</v>

1370
01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:30.540
<v Speaker 3>into Sonora.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they strayed well of all the way up.</v>

1371
01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:33.570
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still today we have by great slave lake,</v>

1372
01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:36.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the extent well up into Canada,</v>

1373
01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:39.270
<v Speaker 3>so there was a number of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people call them wood buffalo,</v>

1374
01:04:39.450 --> 01:04:44.450
<v Speaker 3>some people accept the idea that there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>subspecies by last time about bison.</v>

1375
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:46.250
<v Speaker 3>Bison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Athabaskan,</v>

1376
01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:47.011
<v Speaker 3>Bison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bison,</v>

1377
01:04:47.011 --> 01:04:51.540
<v Speaker 3>Bison Plains Bison would bison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's morphological differences.</v>

1378
01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:54.300
<v Speaker 3>They look different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in the boreal forest.</v>

1379
01:04:54.301 --> 01:04:58.500
<v Speaker 3>There were hundreds that we didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>about and know some of those populations</v>

1380
01:04:58.501 --> 01:05:00.960
<v Speaker 3>are still in now in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have,</v>

1381
01:05:00.961 --> 01:05:01.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1382
01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:03.810
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in all things with Americans,</v>

1383
01:05:03.811 --> 01:05:06.180
<v Speaker 3>we have an American centric view of</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1384
01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:09.660
<v Speaker 3>We have an American centric view of</v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife where we'll say there's only 75</v>

1385
01:05:09.661 --> 01:05:12.540
<v Speaker 3>left and I feel like our Canadian</v>
<v Speaker 3>neighbors are oftentimes being like,</v>

1386
01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:15.240
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't quite handle it quite as badly</v>

1387
01:05:15.241 --> 01:05:19.420
<v Speaker 3>as you folks did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1388
01:05:19.421 --> 01:05:22.330
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1389
01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:23.800
<v Speaker 3>it's a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre picture.</v>

1390
01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:26.440
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember what the hell we get</v>
<v Speaker 3>even got us on the subject.</v>

1391
01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.900
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan Flores,</v>

1392
01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember either.</v>

1393
01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:34.480
<v Speaker 3>Public lands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yellowstone Syndrome,</v>

1394
01:05:34.481 --> 01:05:36.790
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone brucellosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1395
01:05:37.030 --> 01:05:40.550
<v Speaker 3>So there's a tremendous background in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the buffalo story.</v>

1396
01:05:40.551 --> 01:05:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Has we just explored and</v>

1397
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:44.470
<v Speaker 3>w,</v>
<v Speaker 3>W,</v>

1398
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:49.470
<v Speaker 3>W if you follow wildlife politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a conversation happening in places</v>

1399
01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:52.680
<v Speaker 3>like Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a whole other long story,</v>

1400
01:05:52.681 --> 01:05:54.510
<v Speaker 3>but how it's happening there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's happening in Alaska,</v>

1401
01:05:54.511 --> 01:05:57.540
<v Speaker 3>is happening in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's having a Wyoming is happening in</v>

1402
01:05:57.541 --> 01:05:59.640
<v Speaker 3>the DAKOTAS.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1403
01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:02.640
<v Speaker 3>which would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we welcome,</v>

1404
01:06:02.670 --> 01:06:07.670
<v Speaker 3>are we going to welcome this animal back</v>
<v Speaker 3>onto the landscape as a free roaming</v>

1405
01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.740
<v Speaker 3>wild animal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all of our other.</v>

1406
01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:17.790
<v Speaker 3>Earlier I mentioned how this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have an intact suite of megafauna</v>

1407
01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:22.350
<v Speaker 3>like we haven't lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We might have damn few of some things.</v>

1408
01:06:22.351 --> 01:06:24.090
<v Speaker 3>We haven't lost any of our large</v>
<v Speaker 3>mammals.</v>

1409
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:28.320
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of mind boggling during the</v>
<v Speaker 3>colonial period.</v>

1410
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:29.760
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>western Europe,</v>

1411
01:06:29.761 --> 01:06:33.450
<v Speaker 3>I think last five or six species of</v>
<v Speaker 3>large mammals.</v>

1412
01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:37.280
<v Speaker 3>The oryx many things we've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we haven't,</v>

1413
01:06:37.281 --> 01:06:40.190
<v Speaker 3>we haven't lost any large mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We came pretty close though,</v>

1414
01:06:40.191 --> 01:06:41.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn calls with the buffalo in</v>

1415
01:06:41.991 --> 01:06:42.824
<v Speaker 3>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1416
01:06:42.830 --> 01:06:44.150
<v Speaker 3>And we lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've lost birds.</v>

1417
01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:47.000
<v Speaker 3>We lost the passenger pigeon and we lost</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ivory billed woodpecker.</v>

1418
01:06:47.001 --> 01:06:49.910
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we lost many things of many kinds of.</v>

1419
01:06:49.911 --> 01:06:50.511
<v Speaker 3>Many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not many,</v>

1420
01:06:50.511 --> 01:06:53.390
<v Speaker 3>but we've lost substantial numbers of</v>
<v Speaker 3>things we haven't lost any large mammal.</v>

1421
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.790
<v Speaker 3>Extinction is terrifying for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1422
01:06:55.791 --> 01:07:00.240
<v Speaker 3>That's one expression that a extinction</v>
<v Speaker 3>man made.</v>

1423
01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:01.500
<v Speaker 3>Extinction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1424
01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:04.540
<v Speaker 3>That's terrifying for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me it's a,</v>

1425
01:07:04.541 --> 01:07:07.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a moral sin</v>

1426
01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.560
<v Speaker 3>that just is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1427
01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:14.220
<v Speaker 3>we have all these conversations in</v>
<v Speaker 3>bioethics and other things about playing</v>

1428
01:07:14.221 --> 01:07:16.380
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that extinction like human cause</v>

1429
01:07:16.381 --> 01:07:18.690
<v Speaker 3>extinction is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's terrifying.</v>

1430
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you support if there is evidence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human products to human caused</v>

1431
01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:24.290
<v Speaker 1>extinction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there is the opportunity to bring</v>

1432
01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:27.560
<v Speaker 1>something back through scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>methods through like some sort of</v>

1433
01:07:27.561 --> 01:07:29.180
<v Speaker 1>cloning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you support that or you think it's</v>

1434
01:07:29.181 --> 01:07:30.260
<v Speaker 1>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gone,</v>

1435
01:07:30.261 --> 01:07:30.980
<v Speaker 1>it's gone,</v>

1436
01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:32.990
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the fence about it and in my</v>

1437
01:07:32.991 --> 01:07:37.820
<v Speaker 3>understanding of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my understanding of the technology is</v>

1438
01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:41.480
<v Speaker 3>probably too limited for me to really</v>
<v Speaker 3>speak to it with any authority but it.</v>

1439
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:44.930
<v Speaker 3>But the most interesting aspect of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is when you get into the Pleistocene</v>

1440
01:07:44.931 --> 01:07:49.931
<v Speaker 3>extinctions where you notice it just</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to kind of bring people up to speed</v>

1441
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:55.750
<v Speaker 3>on what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just look globally at where we</v>

1442
01:07:55.851 --> 01:07:59.150
<v Speaker 3>lost that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we lost were in when we lost</v>

1443
01:07:59.151 --> 01:08:02.870
<v Speaker 3>package terms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so elephants including the woolly</v>

1444
01:08:02.871 --> 01:08:05.990
<v Speaker 3>mammoth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mastodon and in our own on our own</v>

1445
01:08:05.991 --> 01:08:07.940
<v Speaker 3>continent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look around like where are we</v>

1446
01:08:07.941 --> 01:08:11.570
<v Speaker 3>last packet terms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we always lose pack derms.</v>

1447
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:17.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm right around the time show up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1448
01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:20.230
<v Speaker 3>like we lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we lost them,</v>

1449
01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>humans arrived in the new world.</v>

1450
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:25.250
<v Speaker 3>It's a hotly debated number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>14,</v>

1451
01:08:25.251 --> 01:08:29.510
<v Speaker 3>15,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm kind of contemporaneous with the</v>

1452
01:08:29.511 --> 01:08:34.400
<v Speaker 3>extinction of woolly mammoths and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>know that to some degree humans were</v>

1453
01:08:34.401 --> 01:08:36.730
<v Speaker 3>preying on wooly mammoths and mastodons.</v>

1454
01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:40.840
<v Speaker 3>There's context of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of hunting equipment in context with,</v>

1455
01:08:40.930 --> 01:08:42.190
<v Speaker 3>with wooly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mammoth remains.</v>

1456
01:08:42.191 --> 01:08:44.180
<v Speaker 3>There's butchering sites,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all kinds of stuff.</v>

1457
01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:46.950
<v Speaker 3>And they vanished right around then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1458
01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:52.130
<v Speaker 3>yet we didn't reach an island out in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bering Sea till 4,000 years ago and</v>

1459
01:08:52.131 --> 01:08:54.920
<v Speaker 3>there was a woolly mammoth on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>island till 4,000 years ago.</v>

1460
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:58.100
<v Speaker 3>And then dudes show up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>

1461
01:08:58.490 --> 01:09:01.270
<v Speaker 3>So some people will look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing called the blitzkrieg</v>

1462
01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:04.640
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which hold that all these large mammals</v>

1463
01:09:04.641 --> 01:09:07.190
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine general of large mammals that went</v>

1464
01:09:07.191 --> 01:09:10.610
<v Speaker 3>extinct when humans arrived in the new</v>
<v Speaker 3>world that they were somehow human</v>

1465
01:09:10.611 --> 01:09:12.830
<v Speaker 3>caused extinctions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not other people argue that it was,</v>

1466
01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other things,</v>

1467
01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:17.990
<v Speaker 1>climate change issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Randall Carlson is a guy who I've had on</v>

1468
01:09:17.991 --> 01:09:22.160
<v Speaker 1>my podcast before and he argues that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's due to asteroidal impacts.</v>

1469
01:09:22.161 --> 01:09:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hung out with a guy who's doing</v>

1470
01:09:24.201 --> 01:09:26.720
<v Speaker 1>research on that and there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence of evidence.</v>

1471
01:09:26.721 --> 01:09:30.200
<v Speaker 1>This guy was looking for nano diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy Found namel domain or diamonds,</v>

1472
01:09:30.970 --> 01:09:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I think you say it's called Triton</v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

1473
01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:36.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's nuclear glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same exact glass that they get</v>

1474
01:09:36.081 --> 01:09:38.020
<v Speaker 1>on sand when they have nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosions.</v>

1475
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:41.090
<v Speaker 1>When they do test sites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find that all throughout Europe and</v>

1476
01:09:41.091 --> 01:09:44.090
<v Speaker 1>it's all around 12,000 years and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>also more,</v>

1477
01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:47.300
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around 10,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like somewhere between</v>

1478
01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:51.710
<v Speaker 1>12,000 and then another thousand years</v>
<v Speaker 1>or so later there was another series of</v>

1479
01:09:51.711 --> 01:09:54.200
<v Speaker 1>impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it has to do with this,</v>

1480
01:09:54.201 --> 01:09:57.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroid belt that we pass through.</v>

1481
01:09:57.470 --> 01:10:00.710
<v Speaker 1>And it was fucking fascinating but</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying conversation with.</v>

1482
01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:02.450
<v Speaker 3>I went with a guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1483
01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.740
<v Speaker 3>there's a famous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1484
01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Paleoindian site,</v>
<v Speaker 3>north of Denver called the Linden Meyer</v>

1485
01:10:08.661 --> 01:10:11.480
<v Speaker 3>site and the Linda Meyer site was one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the few,</v>

1486
01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:16.720
<v Speaker 3>not one of the only place that we now</v>
<v Speaker 3>know were large gatherings of the,</v>

1487
01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:22.380
<v Speaker 3>of the folsom culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a large gatherings of the folsom culture</v>

1488
01:10:22.791 --> 01:10:27.470
<v Speaker 3>where you had perhaps hundreds of folsom</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunters in one place at one time and the</v>

1489
01:10:27.471 --> 01:10:29.200
<v Speaker 3>site is marked by a larger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

1490
01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.840
<v Speaker 3>like an easily recognizable escarpment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

1491
01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:35.600
<v Speaker 3>it's presumed that it was just a place</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you could describe and people could</v>

1492
01:10:35.601 --> 01:10:37.060
<v Speaker 3>meet up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the,</v>

1493
01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:40.710
<v Speaker 3>the Linden Meyer site has been studied</v>
<v Speaker 3>extensively in tons of radiocarbon</v>

1494
01:10:40.730 --> 01:10:42.410
<v Speaker 3>dating has happened at Linden Meyer</v>
<v Speaker 3>site.</v>

1495
01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:45.570
<v Speaker 3>And I was with a guy there who was</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking,</v>

1496
01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:48.740
<v Speaker 3>who is working on that theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you know,</v>

1497
01:10:48.741 --> 01:10:51.530
<v Speaker 3>the theory with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the asteroid impact and the nano</v>

1498
01:10:51.531 --> 01:10:55.340
<v Speaker 3>diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was able to go draw samples</v>

1499
01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:59.750
<v Speaker 3>from strata that had been tested and</v>
<v Speaker 3>studied so much,</v>

1500
01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:03.220
<v Speaker 3>which is an expensive laborious process</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get datelines,</v>

1501
01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:03.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was there,</v>

1502
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:07.220
<v Speaker 3>drawn those things out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I had other people who,</v>

1503
01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:11.560
<v Speaker 3>who worked professionally in this space</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about how um,</v>

1504
01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.740
<v Speaker 3>because sorta ridiculing idea</v>

1505
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.640
<v Speaker 2>and saying that it's just like one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas that never dies and I'm</v>

1506
01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:20.200
<v Speaker 2>never quite lives but never quite dies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1507
01:11:20.201 --> 01:11:22.920
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you look at it,</v>

1508
01:11:22.921 --> 01:11:25.380
<v Speaker 2>it's just so hard to believe that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunted them to extinction so quickly.</v>

1509
01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:26.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the many things,</v>

1510
01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:31.230
<v Speaker 2>65 percent of all the North American</v>
<v Speaker 2>mammals died really quickly and it</v>

1511
01:11:31.231 --> 01:11:32.550
<v Speaker 2>wasn't just big stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1512
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:37.140
<v Speaker 2>The thing is like we use it because when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to do digs,</v>

1513
01:11:37.141 --> 01:11:38.940
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they used to do like archeological digs,</v>

1514
01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would use high pressure hoses and</v>

1515
01:11:41.821 --> 01:11:42.480
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were,</v>

1516
01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.700
<v Speaker 2>they only had an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're only looking at the big stuff,</v>

1517
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:46.830
<v Speaker 2>but many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many things went extinct.</v>

1518
01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that bird species?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Small species,</v>

1519
01:11:49.231 --> 01:11:50.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1520
01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:55.650
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda hard to picture it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so hard to picture what</v>

1521
01:11:55.651 --> 01:11:57.030
<v Speaker 2>exactly happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1522
01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in people killing them with</v>

1523
01:12:00.451 --> 01:12:01.240
<v Speaker 2>adult adults.</v>

1524
01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those goofy things.</v>

1525
01:12:02.761 --> 01:12:04.460
<v Speaker 2>Which I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far can you throw an Atlatl,</v>

1526
01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:05.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people kill stuff?</v>

1527
01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Forty yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a real phrase.</v>

1528
01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:12.150
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like the hulk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the thing they say is,</v>

1529
01:12:12.151 --> 01:12:14.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about wildlife in yellowstone</v>

1530
01:12:14.341 --> 01:12:17.490
<v Speaker 2>being habituated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wildlife probably would have been</v>

1531
01:12:17.491 --> 01:12:19.800
<v Speaker 2>the other extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably would have been like,</v>

1532
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:22.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the elk in yellowstone wolves showed up.</v>

1533
01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:23.251
<v Speaker 2>Was it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1534
01:12:23.251 --> 01:12:24.990
<v Speaker 2>what's that cute dog?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1535
01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:28.830
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they have very low fecundity,</v>

1536
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:31.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pack in terms of we're not just talking</v>

1537
01:12:31.621 --> 01:12:32.550
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem.</v>

1538
01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:36.270
<v Speaker 2>We're just talking about packing or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about like a short faced</v>

1539
01:12:36.271 --> 01:12:38.040
<v Speaker 2>bears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American Cheetah,</v>

1540
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.840
<v Speaker 2>giant ground sloths on and on and on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and on to these guys really hunted to</v>

1541
01:12:42.841 --> 01:12:44.700
<v Speaker 2>extinction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to imagine but it's also hard</v>

1542
01:12:44.701 --> 01:12:47.040
<v Speaker 2>to imagine all that shit going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>extinct for any cause.</v>

1543
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Well its also coincides with the end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ice age,</v>

1544
01:12:49.921 --> 01:12:53.580
<v Speaker 2>so something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something radical at the end of the ice</v>

1545
01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:56.160
<v Speaker 2>age is just an idea that we've created,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1546
01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Like we did during.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were interglacial periods,</v>

1547
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:05.580
<v Speaker 2>like if you look at the ice ages are or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pleistocene,</v>

1548
01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:07.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were interglacial periods where</v>

1549
01:13:07.681 --> 01:13:09.600
<v Speaker 2>the water was much higher than it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1550
01:13:09.601 --> 01:13:12.960
<v Speaker 2>There were interglacial periods when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>water would have been up over the</v>

1551
01:13:12.961 --> 01:13:15.580
<v Speaker 2>pedestal of the Statue of Liberty</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1552
01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:19.440
<v Speaker 2>And then shit froze again as like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea that the pleistocene</v>

1553
01:13:19.441 --> 01:13:22.860
<v Speaker 2>holocene transition is just like a.</v>

1554
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:27.210
<v Speaker 2>it's just a point we divided in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>heads,</v>

1555
01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:28.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>

1556
01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:33.000
<v Speaker 2>there was many glaciations right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time will only tell if we ever see</v>

1557
01:13:33.001 --> 01:13:35.420
<v Speaker 2>another glaciation again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

1558
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:38.670
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that makes that</v>

1559
01:13:38.671 --> 01:13:43.671
<v Speaker 2>emboldens people who contradict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that emboldens people</v>

1560
01:13:44.221 --> 01:13:48.960
<v Speaker 2>who contradict human caused climate</v>
<v Speaker 2>change is that we've been through so</v>

1561
01:13:48.961 --> 01:13:51.600
<v Speaker 2>many cycles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll often point out and say,</v>

1562
01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:53.490
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we know this isn't just a normal,</v>

1563
01:13:53.491 --> 01:13:57.990
<v Speaker 2>another warming trend between ice age</v>
<v Speaker 2>periods and then a lot of people pointed</v>

1564
01:13:57.991 --> 01:14:00.630
<v Speaker 2>out and go because there's no evidence</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they ever happened this quickly.</v>

1565
01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:03.210
<v Speaker 2>This is like radically fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are things that played out over</v>

1566
01:14:03.211 --> 01:14:05.760
<v Speaker 2>10,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These aren't things that played out over</v>

1567
01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:07.690
<v Speaker 2>human lifetimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1568
01:14:07.691 --> 01:14:10.920
<v Speaker 2>an interglacial period being a 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>year thing.</v>

1569
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:15.100
<v Speaker 2>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interglacial periods are really</v>

1570
01:14:15.101 --> 01:14:20.101
<v Speaker 2>important to understanding all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues because interglacial periods in</v>

1571
01:14:20.231 --> 01:14:24.280
<v Speaker 2>glacial periods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mark moments when wildlife could have</v>

1572
01:14:24.281 --> 01:14:27.580
<v Speaker 2>come into the new world when wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 2>such as you know,</v>

1573
01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:31.660
<v Speaker 2>buffalo and then later elk and other</v>
<v Speaker 2>things when they would have had the</v>

1574
01:14:31.661 --> 01:14:36.010
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to come from Asia and</v>
<v Speaker 2>crossed the bering land bridge and come</v>

1575
01:14:36.011 --> 01:14:39.450
<v Speaker 2>down and do our to our continent and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it would have,</v>

1576
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:40.690
<v Speaker 2>when they could have not done that.</v>

1577
01:14:41.170 --> 01:14:43.150
<v Speaker 2>So when you look at like when did humans</v>
<v Speaker 2>show up?</v>

1578
01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:46.000
<v Speaker 2>When did these other things show up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when did the horses disappeared?</v>

1579
01:14:46.001 --> 01:14:48.370
<v Speaker 2>When could they have come down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One [inaudible] buffalo come down.</v>

1580
01:14:48.371 --> 01:14:50.620
<v Speaker 2>How did elk get here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're sort of always looking at</v>

1581
01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:56.220
<v Speaker 2>assuming they didn't come down when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>entire north of swerved and 40 feet of</v>

1582
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:58.660
<v Speaker 2>snow and ice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>presuming they came down when it was the</v>

1583
01:14:58.670 --> 01:15:02.800
<v Speaker 2>icefree corridor and so you can kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine tune all these comings and goings,</v>

1584
01:15:02.801 --> 01:15:07.801
<v Speaker 2>but looking at moments when there was an</v>
<v Speaker 2>ice record or to come down and so if</v>

1585
01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:09.520
<v Speaker 2>it's beautifully intertwined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1586
01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.820
<v Speaker 1>it's so complex and there's no way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really lock it down yet has no way to</v>

1587
01:15:13.821 --> 01:15:15.170
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally figured it out yet.</v>

1588
01:15:15.171 --> 01:15:17.870
<v Speaker 1>But it's so fascinating when they find</v>
<v Speaker 1>these animals still.</v>

1589
01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:23.340
<v Speaker 1>They just pulled a big giant skull with</v>
<v Speaker 1>tusks out of a ranch in Montana.</v>

1590
01:15:24.501 --> 01:15:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Like really recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I tweeted it,</v>

1591
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I think it was c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if you could find it on</v>

1592
01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.960
<v Speaker 2>my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Found a jaw with the maulers in it,</v>

1593
01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:33.270
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1594
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:34.830
<v Speaker 1>to museum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1595
01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:37.920
<v Speaker 1>He just found a couple of years ago he</v>
<v Speaker 1>found it in the tone.</v>

1596
01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:42.810
<v Speaker 1>My friend John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his buddy owns a ranch in Montana and he</v>

1597
01:15:42.811 --> 01:15:45.990
<v Speaker 1>was talking to some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This might be the same guy.</v>

1598
01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you know where it was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1599
01:15:47.161 --> 01:15:47.994
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this was.</v>

1600
01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:50.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the tusks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1601
01:15:50.011 --> 01:15:50.630
<v Speaker 1>nevermind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1602
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:51.140
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1603
01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:53.340
<v Speaker 1>they found a dinosaur on his property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said the,</v>

1604
01:15:53.341 --> 01:15:55.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archaeologists came.</v>

1605
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:56.490
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A paleontologist?</v>

1606
01:15:56.491 --> 01:15:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Paleontologist paleontologist came to</v>
<v Speaker 1>his property.</v>

1607
01:15:59.190 --> 01:16:01.680
<v Speaker 1>He said he went for a walk up the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stopped.</v>

1608
01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:05.040
<v Speaker 1>He found something on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked around,</v>

1609
01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.950
<v Speaker 1>he made some calculations and it came</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to him.</v>

1610
01:16:08.010 --> 01:16:09.450
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>congratulations.</v>

1611
01:16:09.451 --> 01:16:11.460
<v Speaker 1>You got a dinosaur on your property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was what?</v>

1612
01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:13.650
<v Speaker 1>They came back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a fucking t-rex on his</v>

1613
01:16:13.651 --> 01:16:15.930
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one guy got a million and a half</v>

1614
01:16:15.931 --> 01:16:19.850
<v Speaker 1>dollars because they pulled a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>t-rex from his property for the</v>

1615
01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:21.240
<v Speaker 1>paleontologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found it,</v>

1616
01:16:21.450 --> 01:16:24.690
<v Speaker 1>and literally founded in five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said he started walking around the</v>

1617
01:16:24.691 --> 01:16:27.560
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He found a tooth or some sort of chip,</v>

1618
01:16:27.570 --> 01:16:30.270
<v Speaker 1>a piece of bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He recognized it immediately as being</v>

1619
01:16:30.271 --> 01:16:32.210
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made some phone calls,</v>

1620
01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:34.410
<v Speaker 1>called some people and next thing you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1621
01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.720
<v Speaker 1>like within weeks they had started</v>
<v Speaker 1>excavations.</v>

1622
01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.290
<v Speaker 1>No shit found a fucking t rex and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>prepping cars because it was on private</v>

1623
01:16:40.291 --> 01:16:42.120
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could sell it a million and a half</v>

1624
01:16:42.121 --> 01:16:43.020
<v Speaker 1>dollars on</v>

1625
01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:45.680
<v Speaker 2>public land Foa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once something's fossilized,</v>

1626
01:16:45.681 --> 01:16:47.210
<v Speaker 2>you can't touch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1627
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:49.490
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do I agree?</v>

1628
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Cause I don't want to escape your</v>
<v Speaker 2>question about</v>

1629
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:59.110
<v Speaker 2>undoing human caused extinctions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else getting at is the animals that</v>

1630
01:17:01.041 --> 01:17:05.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm most interested in just from a boy</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a very boyish way.</v>

1631
01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Are those pleistocene creditors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1632
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:14.310
<v Speaker 2>and if I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1633
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:17.090
<v Speaker 2>if I had the diamond and bullet right</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would tell me that.</v>

1634
01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1635
01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:24.130
<v Speaker 2>We lost the mammoth because of human</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting behaviors at the pleistocene</v>

1636
01:17:24.861 --> 01:17:26.450
<v Speaker 2>holocene transition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will be like,</v>

1637
01:17:26.451 --> 01:17:28.380
<v Speaker 2>let's bring them sons of bitches back</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1638
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could prove without a shadow of a</v>

1639
01:17:31.681 --> 01:17:34.440
<v Speaker 2>doubt that human hunters created that</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1640
01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I knew the tech,</v>

1641
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:38.080
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say the technology was just fail</v>

1642
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:39.390
<v Speaker 2>safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to talk about some</v>

1643
01:17:39.391 --> 01:17:41.220
<v Speaker 2>controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think people are up in arms about</v>

1644
01:17:41.221 --> 01:17:45.540
<v Speaker 2>some buffalo hunting around you cut</v>
<v Speaker 2>loose them short faced bears or you</v>

1645
01:17:45.550 --> 01:17:47.410
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be a giant issue.</v>

1646
01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think the wolf reintroduction when</v>

1647
01:17:49.061 --> 01:17:51.990
<v Speaker 2>she was shaky?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The short face bear,</v>

1648
01:17:51.991 --> 01:17:53.340
<v Speaker 2>the scary guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have animal.</v>

1649
01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:56.430
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge bear very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1650
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1651
01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.111
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

1652
01:17:58.111 --> 01:18:01.650
<v Speaker 2>they were a fast runner and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger than polar bears.</v>

1653
01:18:01.770 --> 01:18:02.970
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1654
01:18:02.971 --> 01:18:04.830
<v Speaker 2>the American Cheetah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1655
01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:08.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason why antelope are so</v>

1656
01:18:08.281 --> 01:18:10.290
<v Speaker 2>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a theory that the antelope are</v>

1657
01:18:10.291 --> 01:18:13.410
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously fast for any predator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like,</v>

1658
01:18:13.450 --> 01:18:18.450
<v Speaker 2>there's speed doesn't make sense through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the context of what's chasing them right</v>

1659
01:18:18.731 --> 01:18:20.710
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do people call them speed goats</v>

1660
01:18:20.770 --> 01:18:22.300
<v Speaker 2>while they haul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why goat?</v>

1661
01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there I think there's a,</v>

1662
01:18:25.211 --> 01:18:29.380
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a dumb ass reason and there's a</v>

1663
01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:33.850
<v Speaker 2>tax nonvocal reason and I know dear</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends of mine on both sides of that</v>

1664
01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:38.320
<v Speaker 2>spectrum where I'm fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I put it to my brother who on</v>

1665
01:18:38.321 --> 01:18:40.990
<v Speaker 2>occasion calls him goats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll talk about how taxonomically</v>

1666
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:42.223
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1667
01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:43.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're distinct.</v>

1668
01:18:43.090 --> 01:18:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Like they're the only thing in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the only thing in their family,</v>

1669
01:18:46.511 --> 01:18:47.344
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1670
01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.990
<v Speaker 2>they don't have any close relatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there,</v>

1671
01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:53.200
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are only there a horned animal</v>

1672
01:18:53.230 --> 01:18:56.320
<v Speaker 2>that sheds its horns and antlers shed</v>
<v Speaker 2>elk,</v>

1673
01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:56.951
<v Speaker 2>Moose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deer.</v>

1674
01:18:56.951 --> 01:18:59.350
<v Speaker 2>All the servants like antler shed horns</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't shed.</v>

1675
01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Animals carry their horns for their</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole life.</v>

1676
01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Like a Kraton a sheath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But antelope shed their horn.</v>

1677
01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:09.880
<v Speaker 2>But it turns out that some people like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to point out that they're like a close</v>

1678
01:19:09.881 --> 01:19:12.730
<v Speaker 2>to a goat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The goat is close.</v>

1679
01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Other people say just because they kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of looked like goats.</v>

1680
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:18.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a derogatory term.</v>

1681
01:19:18.721 --> 01:19:21.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like derogatory animal terms.</v>

1682
01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:24.090
<v Speaker 2>The why is goat a derogatory tone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1683
01:19:24.091 --> 01:19:26.040
<v Speaker 2>go is what people call the greatest of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all time.</v>

1684
01:19:26.041 --> 01:19:28.740
<v Speaker 2>It's the goat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now a mountain goat is a noble,</v>

1685
01:19:28.741 --> 01:19:30.080
<v Speaker 2>majestic animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1686
01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:32.550
<v Speaker 2>A barnyard go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's noble and Majesta.</v>

1687
01:19:32.551 --> 01:19:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think they're equating it to</v>

1688
01:19:34.321 --> 01:19:35.360
<v Speaker 2>a mountain goat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1689
01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:37.140
<v Speaker 2>The mountain go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being as beautiful white,</v>

1690
01:19:37.141 --> 01:19:39.810
<v Speaker 2>fluffy goats will be in a wild animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are awesome.</v>

1691
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wild animal.</v>

1692
01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:43.020
<v Speaker 2>And to be like a speed go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying like,</v>

1693
01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:44.100
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a goat,</v>

1694
01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:47.250
<v Speaker 2>a lowly barnyard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go that hauls ass.</v>

1695
01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:49.770
<v Speaker 2>I was just in his act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel that this derogatory.</v>

1696
01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:51.720
<v Speaker 2>This is a minor issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll point out.</v>

1697
01:19:51.721 --> 01:19:55.140
<v Speaker 2>But it does bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's derogatory to call it</v>

1698
01:19:55.141 --> 01:19:56.450
<v Speaker 2>a go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do think that.</v>

1699
01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:59.340
<v Speaker 2>And I haven't met whatever it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't met anyone who does think it's</v>

1700
01:19:59.341 --> 01:20:03.570
<v Speaker 2>derogatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's so funny because mountain goat,</v>

1701
01:20:03.571 --> 01:20:07.470
<v Speaker 2>you agree as a noble animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to you.</v>

1702
01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.540
<v Speaker 2>I was in Hawaiian culture everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bizarre.</v>

1703
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Driving down the road.</v>

1704
01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:12.660
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking goats everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which just wild goats.</v>

1705
01:20:12.661 --> 01:20:14.490
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like a wild animal.</v>

1706
01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You already talked about wildlife</v>

1707
01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.750
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii.</v>

1708
01:20:19.170 --> 01:20:20.880
<v Speaker 2>Hm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever want to get into that?</v>

1709
01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:21.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

1710
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:24.270
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you have your whole suite of</v>

1711
01:20:24.271 --> 01:20:25.130
<v Speaker 2>mammals is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1712
01:20:25.131 --> 01:20:27.060
<v Speaker 2>your whole suite of mammals is all non</v>
<v Speaker 2>native.</v>

1713
01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them.</v>

1714
01:20:28.410 --> 01:20:30.600
<v Speaker 2>But here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's where it's interesting.</v>

1715
01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:34.010
<v Speaker 2>So polynesians colonize the Hawaiian</v>
<v Speaker 2>islands,</v>

1716
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:36.390
<v Speaker 2>like the first people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first humans to colonize the</v>

1717
01:20:36.391 --> 01:20:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Hawaiian islands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Polynesians who carried with them rats.</v>

1718
01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:43.440
<v Speaker 2>Dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pigs,</v>

1719
01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:47.550
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have native Hawaiians,</v>

1720
01:20:48.150 --> 01:20:50.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Hawaiians and indigenous Hawaiians.</v>

1721
01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:53.700
<v Speaker 2>People are carrying native rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They regard themselves as native</v>

1722
01:20:53.701 --> 01:20:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Hawaiians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet people are always telling them that</v>

1723
01:20:56.221 --> 01:21:01.221
<v Speaker 2>the wildlife is non native,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you get people that showed up with</v>

1724
01:21:02.551 --> 01:21:06.930
<v Speaker 2>pigs and now the nature conservancy will</v>
<v Speaker 2>get chunks of land in Hawaii and</v>

1725
01:21:06.931 --> 01:21:11.931
<v Speaker 2>eradicate the non natives and the native</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaiians be like,</v>

1726
01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:14.580
<v Speaker 2>but were contemporaneous with these</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

1727
01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:17.160
<v Speaker 2>How am I native?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1728
01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:19.740
<v Speaker 2>but you're telling me that the thing I</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to hunt is not native.</v>

1729
01:21:19.741 --> 01:21:22.140
<v Speaker 2>It needs to be gotten rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

1730
01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.780
<v Speaker 2>They should think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1731
01:21:25.370 --> 01:21:28.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to say they like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a unanimously held viewpoint,</v>

1732
01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.810
<v Speaker 2>but people who hold the viewpoint of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1733
01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:33.030
<v Speaker 2>they that they hunt pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their father hunt pigs,</v>

1734
01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:34.830
<v Speaker 2>their grandfather hump pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're great.</v>

1735
01:21:34.831 --> 01:21:35.221
<v Speaker 2>Great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

1736
01:21:35.221 --> 01:21:36.140
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great grandfather,</v>

1737
01:21:36.170 --> 01:21:39.060
<v Speaker 2>hundred pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what's the pressure coming from to</v>

1738
01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:41.730
<v Speaker 2>eradicate them from agriculture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1739
01:21:41.731 --> 01:21:46.260
<v Speaker 2>it's from people who who are worried</v>
<v Speaker 2>about losing yet more and we've already</v>

1740
01:21:46.261 --> 01:21:47.490
<v Speaker 2>lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know.</v>

1741
01:21:47.491 --> 01:21:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Speaking regional extinctions are extra</v>
<v Speaker 2>patients and in some cases extinction</v>

1742
01:21:51.421 --> 01:21:54.870
<v Speaker 2>extinction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've lost dozens of species of,</v>

1743
01:21:55.030 --> 01:22:00.030
<v Speaker 2>of Hawaiian Flora and fauna to</v>
<v Speaker 2>considering a wide range of ground</v>

1744
01:22:02.401 --> 01:22:05.160
<v Speaker 2>nesting birds have been lost to rats and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pigs.</v>

1745
01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.930
<v Speaker 2>So now it's not so much focused on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals but,</v>

1746
01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:13.260
<v Speaker 2>but flora,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there are people who are trying to</v>

1747
01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:15.780
<v Speaker 2>read who would like to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I get where they're coming</v>

1748
01:22:15.781 --> 01:22:17.820
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would like to restore,</v>

1749
01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:20.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>large areas of,</v>

1750
01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:25.830
<v Speaker 2>of native</v>
<v Speaker 2>plant communities in the Hawaiian</v>

1751
01:22:25.831 --> 01:22:27.360
<v Speaker 2>islands because anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go there,</v>

1752
01:22:27.361 --> 01:22:30.600
<v Speaker 2>all the fruit you see the coconuts are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not native papayas,</v>

1753
01:22:30.601 --> 01:22:32.130
<v Speaker 2>mangoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breadfruit,</v>

1754
01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:33.240
<v Speaker 2>none of that stuff's native.</v>

1755
01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:35.850
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all introduced.</v>

1756
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.890
<v Speaker 2>It's a p that places a petri dish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1757
01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:40.620
<v Speaker 2>They got their turkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pheasants,</v>

1758
01:22:40.621 --> 01:22:44.490
<v Speaker 2>chucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hunting access and everything</v>

1759
01:22:44.491 --> 01:22:46.010
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But none of that shit's from there.</v>

1760
01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:47.940
<v Speaker 2>So there are some people who look and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say like,</v>

1761
01:22:47.941 --> 01:22:48.690
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1762
01:22:48.690 --> 01:22:49.250
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1763
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:51.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ecological responsibility to try to</v>

1764
01:22:51.541 --> 01:22:54.480
<v Speaker 2>salvage some part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile,</v>

1765
01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:58.500
<v Speaker 2>another perspective would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we made this place bloom,</v>

1766
01:22:58.770 --> 01:23:01.740
<v Speaker 2>this place oozes with life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's people who,</v>

1767
01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get all their,</v>

1768
01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 2>they're able to glean all of their</v>

1769
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:11.040
<v Speaker 5>food sources from the island,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from things that their ancestors have</v>

1770
01:23:11.411 --> 01:23:13.510
<v Speaker 5>established on the island,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's offensive to them.</v>

1771
01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:19.120
<v Speaker 5>Do you know about Darwin visiting the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Galapagos silence and that it's one of</v>

1772
01:23:19.121 --> 01:23:24.121
<v Speaker 5>the ways that he sort of formulated his</v>
<v Speaker 5>theories about evolution and all the</v>

1773
01:23:24.161 --> 01:23:27.190
<v Speaker 5>various variety of wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1774
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:31.390
<v Speaker 5>through visiting the Galapagos islands</v>
<v Speaker 5>unintentionally.</v>

1775
01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:35.200
<v Speaker 5>People have had seeds that they brought</v>
<v Speaker 5>with them on the bottom of their shoes.</v>

1776
01:23:35.530 --> 01:23:36.550
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>

1777
01:23:36.610 --> 01:23:39.710
<v Speaker 5>Which is really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And all these animals and plants are</v>

1778
01:23:39.711 --> 01:23:44.380
<v Speaker 5>either are growing that are non native</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this debate pops up as to what to do</v>

1779
01:23:44.381 --> 01:23:47.110
<v Speaker 5>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there's all these turtles that</v>

1780
01:23:47.111 --> 01:23:50.890
<v Speaker 5>live there and there's this debate props</v>
<v Speaker 5>up as to like how to protect these</v>

1781
01:23:50.891 --> 01:23:53.590
<v Speaker 5>turtles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they brought in goats to eradicate</v>

1782
01:23:53.591 --> 01:23:55.960
<v Speaker 5>some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the plants now.</v>

1783
01:23:56.610 --> 01:23:58.480
<v Speaker 5>And there's some people brought goats</v>
<v Speaker 5>over there,</v>

1784
01:23:58.481 --> 01:24:00.890
<v Speaker 5>like some sailors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>brock goats over there as a food source</v>

1785
01:24:00.891 --> 01:24:02.410
<v Speaker 5>and left them on the island figuring,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1786
01:24:02.411 --> 01:24:03.880
<v Speaker 5>we'll stop back when we need food.</v>

1787
01:24:04.210 --> 01:24:06.850
<v Speaker 5>And now they've got goat problems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're trying to figure out how to</v>

1788
01:24:06.851 --> 01:24:08.110
<v Speaker 5>eradicate the goats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

1789
01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:10.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Judas,</v>

1790
01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.450
<v Speaker 5>Judas goat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>

1791
01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:15.280
<v Speaker 5>Well they take one goat and they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1792
01:24:15.281 --> 01:24:18.460
<v Speaker 5>they sterilize that goat and so that</v>
<v Speaker 5>goat can't breed,</v>

1793
01:24:18.461 --> 01:24:21.310
<v Speaker 5>but that goat will find all the other</v>
<v Speaker 5>goats and hang out with that goat and</v>

1794
01:24:21.311 --> 01:24:24.700
<v Speaker 5>they put a radio collar on the little</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucker and then he lets them know where</v>

1795
01:24:24.701 --> 01:24:26.890
<v Speaker 5>the other goats are and then they gunned</v>
<v Speaker 5>down those goats</v>

1796
01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:29.441
<v Speaker 5>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1797
01:24:29.441 --> 01:24:32.560
<v Speaker 5>I to go find some other goats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he goes and finds the other one.</v>

1798
01:24:32.561 --> 01:24:33.070
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1799
01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:35.500
<v Speaker 5>we found him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is the poor guy,</v>

1800
01:24:35.501 --> 01:24:38.320
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know if he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

1801
01:24:38.321 --> 01:24:40.750
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>am I lucky they show up in his</v>

1802
01:24:40.751 --> 01:24:42.030
<v Speaker 5>helicopter that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1803
01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:45.250
<v Speaker 5>that may have taken them out like</v>
<v Speaker 5>platoon style.</v>

1804
01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:45.941
<v Speaker 5>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the writer,</v>

1805
01:24:45.941 --> 01:24:47.500
<v Speaker 5>Tom Robbins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1806
01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:50.780
<v Speaker 5>is he still alive?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Skinny legs and all.</v>

1807
01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.690
<v Speaker 5>I think he jitterbug perfume.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1808
01:24:52.691 --> 01:24:54.220
<v Speaker 5>I think he's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1809
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:55.600
<v Speaker 5>he was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of his books,</v>

1810
01:24:55.601 --> 01:24:58.540
<v Speaker 5>he talks about Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how Hawaii had a rat problem.</v>

1811
01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:04.260
<v Speaker 5>Then they brought in the mongoose and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had a mongoose problem and he makes</v>

1812
01:25:05.591 --> 01:25:08.590
<v Speaker 5>the joke that we had a crime problem and</v>
<v Speaker 5>we brought in cops.</v>

1813
01:25:12.630 --> 01:25:17.290
<v Speaker 5>Well that's sort of what Australia did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Australia brought in Fox to deal with</v>

1814
01:25:17.291 --> 01:25:18.970
<v Speaker 5>the rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They brought in rabbits.</v>

1815
01:25:18.971 --> 01:25:21.370
<v Speaker 5>The rabbits got out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They brought in Fox and deal with the</v>

1816
01:25:21.371 --> 01:25:24.100
<v Speaker 5>rabbits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Fox already in ground nesting birds.</v>

1817
01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:28.240
<v Speaker 5>And they brought in cats as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have a huge feral cat problem in</v>

1818
01:25:28.241 --> 01:25:31.180
<v Speaker 5>Australia to the point where they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunting magazines are really bizarre</v>

1819
01:25:31.450 --> 01:25:36.450
<v Speaker 5>because holding up cats like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like my friend Adam Green tree lives in</v>

1820
01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:39.250
<v Speaker 5>Australia and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1821
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:43.060
<v Speaker 5>it's a crazy place because it's similar</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a lot of ways that Hawaii is,</v>

1822
01:25:43.061 --> 01:25:45.400
<v Speaker 5>that a lot of the animals they or not</v>
<v Speaker 5>native,</v>

1823
01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.440
<v Speaker 5>but they're hunting magazines are filled</v>
<v Speaker 5>with fucking dogs and cats and shit.</v>

1824
01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:55.000
<v Speaker 5>It's just weird to literally shaken up</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mary if you left one of those on an</v>

1825
01:25:55.001 --> 01:25:57.490
<v Speaker 5>airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the next passenger to find while I</v>

1826
01:25:57.491 --> 01:26:00.610
<v Speaker 5>was on an airplane and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to the part where the guy was</v>

1827
01:26:00.611 --> 01:26:03.670
<v Speaker 5>holding up the cat grip and grin and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>just turned the page real quick.</v>

1828
01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 5>Come</v>

1829
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.650
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Jesus is heavy.</v>

1830
01:26:07.710 --> 01:26:09.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The non native thing is,</v>

1831
01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:10.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1832
01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:13.350
<v Speaker 3>it amazes me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our inability</v>

1833
01:26:14.850 --> 01:26:17.050
<v Speaker 3>to anticipate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I guess it's Kang.</v>

1834
01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like weirdly contradictory,</v>

1835
01:26:20.010 --> 01:26:23.760
<v Speaker 3>our inability to anticipate unintended</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences,</v>

1836
01:26:23.761 --> 01:26:25.890
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't entirely make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you see what I'm getting at.</v>

1837
01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:26.753
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1838
01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:28.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1839
01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Well there's no forethought to bring in</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxes or cats like and say,</v>

1840
01:26:33.741 --> 01:26:36.340
<v Speaker 1>well they're just gonna eat the rabbit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we left behind.</v>

1841
01:26:36.341 --> 01:26:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1842
01:26:36.810 --> 01:26:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Had Your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna eat everything.</v>

1843
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I kid you not see that coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you know what a cat does?</v>

1844
01:26:42.710 --> 01:26:43.521
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's killed things.</v>

1845
01:26:43.521 --> 01:26:45.240
<v Speaker 1>You can't even throw a ball of yarn in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of a fucking.</v>

1846
01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1847
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:49.090
<v Speaker 3>it Kinda doesn't end like we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're doing it now.</v>

1848
01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.640
<v Speaker 3>Something we just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We won't know yet.</v>

1849
01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:56.800
<v Speaker 3>In 10 years we'll be there 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll be goofing on.</v>

1850
01:26:56.801 --> 01:26:59.440
<v Speaker 3>Something we're doing right now that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>think is a good idea probably,</v>

1851
01:26:59.441 --> 01:27:00.274
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1852
01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:03.250
<v Speaker 3>Well we like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you believe those dumb asses?</v>

1853
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In 2016 thought x,</v>

1854
01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:09.520
<v Speaker 3>I have some theories about what those</v>
<v Speaker 3>things might be,</v>

1855
01:27:09.521 --> 01:27:10.354
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1856
01:27:10.930 --> 01:27:11.763
<v Speaker 3>we're not done</v>

1857
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:13.590
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Commercial sales,</v>

1858
01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:17.070
<v Speaker 1>commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large scale agriculture in a way is not</v>

1859
01:27:17.071 --> 01:27:18.600
<v Speaker 1>only just really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really recent.</v>

1860
01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:22.680
<v Speaker 1>It's completely unnatural to have these</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant swaths of land.</v>

1861
01:27:22.681 --> 01:27:24.470
<v Speaker 1>It's filled with corn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Like monoculture stuff's very unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people that think about like,</v>

1863
01:27:27.961 --> 01:27:28.441
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1864
01:27:28.441 --> 01:27:29.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating vegetables,</v>

1865
01:27:29.701 --> 01:27:33.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating natural and I'm not a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole factory farm system.</v>

1866
01:27:33.661 --> 01:27:34.680
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>

1867
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:36.960
<v Speaker 1>You're a part of factory agriculture</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1868
01:27:36.961 --> 01:27:39.390
<v Speaker 1>If you're eating corn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're buying corn,</v>

1869
01:27:39.391 --> 01:27:41.400
<v Speaker 1>you're eating corn on the cob thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all healthy.</v>

1870
01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:44.640
<v Speaker 1>That shit is coming from a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>unnatural place.</v>

1871
01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.900
<v Speaker 1>It's coming from this ground that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been filled up with all this nitrogen</v>

1872
01:27:48.901 --> 01:27:51.150
<v Speaker 1>that's been sucked out of the air</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the harbor method.</v>

1873
01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:53.160
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've dumped it into the earth because</v>

1874
01:27:53.161 --> 01:27:55.920
<v Speaker 1>the earth earth's been depleted with</v>
<v Speaker 1>minerals to the point where they're no</v>

1875
01:27:55.921 --> 01:28:00.360
<v Speaker 1>longer supports growth of plants unless</v>
<v Speaker 1>you add stuff to it and then you have</v>

1876
01:28:00.361 --> 01:28:04.050
<v Speaker 1>these large scale machines that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to attend to this stuff.</v>

1877
01:28:04.051 --> 01:28:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing natural about large</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale agriculture.</v>

1878
01:28:06.871 --> 01:28:09.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just don't consider it because we</v>

1879
01:28:09.571 --> 01:28:14.571
<v Speaker 1>consider factory farming when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to living animals as being horrific,</v>

1880
01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:17.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's pigs or cows or chickens,</v>

1881
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:19.980
<v Speaker 1>that disturbs almost anybody with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>

1882
01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:24.780
<v Speaker 1>but we don't think twice about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of large scale agriculture</v>

1883
01:28:24.781 --> 01:28:27.160
<v Speaker 1>on actual wildlife and wild</v>

1884
01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:30.940
<v Speaker 3>when you picture that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean much vaster than this,</v>

1885
01:28:30.941 --> 01:28:35.941
<v Speaker 3>but we have entire counties that support</v>
<v Speaker 3>a single species of plant of plant.</v>

1886
01:28:37.630 --> 01:28:40.580
<v Speaker 3>Oftentimes a single species of a non</v>
<v Speaker 3>native plant.</v>

1887
01:28:41.230 --> 01:28:43.000
<v Speaker 3>Corn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Corn is.</v>

1888
01:28:44.770 --> 01:28:46.220
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a native,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1889
01:28:46.221 --> 01:28:48.680
<v Speaker 3>it's derived from maze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like kind of a native species.</v>

1890
01:28:48.681 --> 01:28:53.681
<v Speaker 3>So oftentimes it's like entire county's</v>
<v Speaker 3>given over to a single non native plant.</v>

1891
01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Well isn't corn sort of like looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a domestic dog and saying,</v>

1892
01:29:00.621 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 1>well that domestic dog as</v>

1893
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:03.100
<v Speaker 3>a wild animal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1894
01:29:03.101 --> 01:29:03.491
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1895
01:29:03.491 --> 01:29:05.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you took someone from</v>

1896
01:29:05.971 --> 01:29:09.840
<v Speaker 3>pre-colombian times and showed them a</v>
<v Speaker 3>corn cob,</v>

1897
01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:10.703
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1898
01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:12.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that they would probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize that.</v>

1899
01:29:12.591 --> 01:29:13.980
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't know what the fuck that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

1900
01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:16.170
<v Speaker 3>They were dealing with a corn that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

1901
01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:19.740
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a smaller than when you are</v>

1902
01:29:19.741 --> 01:29:22.350
<v Speaker 3>making a stir fry and get the little</v>
<v Speaker 3>baby corn things,</v>

1903
01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:24.030
<v Speaker 3>whether that's small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small,</v>

1904
01:29:24.031 --> 01:29:24.864
<v Speaker 3>little things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1905
01:29:24.930 --> 01:29:27.990
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't even tell like they can't</v>

1906
01:29:27.991 --> 01:29:30.990
<v Speaker 3>tell how it even came to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people have a theory that it was</v>

1907
01:29:30.991 --> 01:29:35.430
<v Speaker 3>bred from a grass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're like the lineage of</v>

1908
01:29:35.431 --> 01:29:38.190
<v Speaker 3>corn is hard to track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1909
01:29:38.191 --> 01:29:41.610
<v Speaker 3>So was this native Americans that did</v>
<v Speaker 3>this where they figured out how to</v>

1910
01:29:41.611 --> 01:29:44.700
<v Speaker 3>splice these plants together and tie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a book,</v>

1911
01:29:44.730 --> 01:29:46.680
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the name of the book</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gets into it,</v>

1912
01:29:46.710 --> 01:29:50.970
<v Speaker 3>but just trying to like track down sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the history of corn and how it came</v>

1913
01:29:50.971 --> 01:29:51.540
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>

1914
01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:52.890
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the oftentimes points you would</v>

1915
01:29:52.891 --> 01:29:56.820
<v Speaker 3>domestication of animals and plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it was sort of an accidental</v>

1916
01:29:56.821 --> 01:29:57.870
<v Speaker 3>domestication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1917
01:29:57.871 --> 01:29:59.280
<v Speaker 3>like you'd go out and gather something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1918
01:29:59.281 --> 01:30:01.710
<v Speaker 3>and you bring it home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you process it near your home,</v>

1919
01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.230
<v Speaker 3>you're scattering seed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1920
01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:06.870
<v Speaker 3>And eventually you're like creating</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things.</v>

1921
01:30:06.871 --> 01:30:07.561
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>corns,</v>

1922
01:30:07.561 --> 01:30:10.890
<v Speaker 3>difficult to track the lineage of corn</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not clear.</v>

1923
01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:15.510
<v Speaker 3>It's just so bizarre what kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>foothold it has an American culture to</v>

1924
01:30:15.511 --> 01:30:16.130
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1925
01:30:16.130 --> 01:30:17.340
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's crazy.</v>

1926
01:30:17.341 --> 01:30:21.960
<v Speaker 3>I recently interviewed for a documentary</v>
<v Speaker 3>project we're working on.</v>

1927
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:24.780
<v Speaker 3>I interviewed a animal he's at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's from California.</v>

1928
01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:27.180
<v Speaker 3>He's an animal rights activist and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

1929
01:30:27.210 --> 01:30:32.210
<v Speaker 3>he teaches animal ethics and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has a brand of veganism that I think</v>

1930
01:30:32.491 --> 01:30:34.050
<v Speaker 3>it would be refreshing to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should have this guy.</v>

1931
01:30:34.090 --> 01:30:35.400
<v Speaker 3>I keep telling him you should have on</v>
<v Speaker 3>your show.</v>

1932
01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:36.650
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1933
01:30:36.650 --> 01:30:37.830
<v Speaker 3>he has a barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's his name?</v>

1934
01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.650
<v Speaker 3>His name's Robert Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a very,</v>

1935
01:30:40.651 --> 01:30:44.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>refreshing sort of veganism.</v>

1936
01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:48.290
<v Speaker 3>I'd had this dude over dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1937
01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1938
01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:49.873
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

1939
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:52.870
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't hold out ideas that he's peer</v>

1940
01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:56.190
<v Speaker 3>because of what we're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1941
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:59.960
<v Speaker 3>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's educated enough about agriculture</v>

1942
01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:05.000
<v Speaker 3>and educated enough about the inherent</v>
<v Speaker 3>struggle,</v>

1943
01:31:05.001 --> 01:31:08.540
<v Speaker 3>the inherent life and death through all</v>
<v Speaker 3>food production did.</v>

1944
01:31:08.541 --> 01:31:09.710
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1945
01:31:09.711 --> 01:31:13.550
<v Speaker 3>I have all the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am the gentle kind one because he's</v>

1946
01:31:13.551 --> 01:31:18.551
<v Speaker 3>seen cornfields like he knows like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're churning your violently churning</v>

1947
01:31:18.891 --> 01:31:21.860
<v Speaker 3>the land with the equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things are dying when you grow</v>

1948
01:31:21.861 --> 01:31:26.861
<v Speaker 3>vegetables like we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in meshed in a in a cycle of life</v>

1949
01:31:26.931 --> 01:31:28.730
<v Speaker 3>and death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is inescapable.</v>

1950
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:30.360
<v Speaker 3>His point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not on.</v>

1951
01:31:30.361 --> 01:31:32.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to totally steal the guy's</v>
<v Speaker 3>pointing.</v>

1952
01:31:32.351 --> 01:31:37.351
<v Speaker 3>He'd do a better job explain himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his point is that if we agree that</v>

1953
01:31:38.211 --> 01:31:41.060
<v Speaker 3>we should minimize suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1954
01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.490
<v Speaker 3>There are steps we can take to minimize</v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>

1955
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Not Saying that I've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Answer is no,</v>

1956
01:31:45.651 --> 01:31:49.700
<v Speaker 3>I've got it figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we want to minimize the suffering</v>

1957
01:31:49.701 --> 01:31:54.110
<v Speaker 3>of sentient beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's a conversation we should</v>

1958
01:31:54.111 --> 01:31:54.920
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

1959
01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:57.740
<v Speaker 3>The best thing that he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best thing that he said in</v>

1960
01:31:57.741 --> 01:31:59.920
<v Speaker 3>explaining the animal rights movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I've always been a little bit</v>

1961
01:31:59.921 --> 01:32:04.921
<v Speaker 3>baffled by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he gets into this idea of he uses the</v>

1962
01:32:05.711 --> 01:32:07.780
<v Speaker 3>term speciesism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1963
01:32:07.781 --> 01:32:08.830
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1964
01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:11.140
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had,</v>

1965
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:16.810
<v Speaker 3>we've dealt with and deal with racism</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've dealt with and deal with sexism</v>

1966
01:32:17.230 --> 01:32:19.930
<v Speaker 3>and we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would argue,</v>

1967
01:32:19.931 --> 01:32:21.370
<v Speaker 3>I think he would say we're on the cusp</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1968
01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:26.440
<v Speaker 3>of tackling our problem with speciesism</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he would say like if you went to</v>

1969
01:32:26.650 --> 01:32:27.770
<v Speaker 3>someone like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1970
01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:31.840
<v Speaker 3>if you went to the Mississippi Delta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1971
01:32:31.841 --> 01:32:35.590
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the 17 and late 17 hundreds and said</v>

1972
01:32:35.591 --> 01:32:36.490
<v Speaker 3>to someone like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1973
01:32:36.491 --> 01:32:39.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever thought about the fact</v>

1974
01:32:39.281 --> 01:32:41.560
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1975
01:32:41.561 --> 01:32:43.930
<v Speaker 3>you kind of like own and abuse these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1976
01:32:43.931 --> 01:32:46.840
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever thought about how they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people too,</v>

1977
01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:49.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like you and me.</v>

1978
01:32:50.050 --> 01:32:51.220
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was saying like,</v>

1979
01:32:51.221 --> 01:32:52.960
<v Speaker 3>the guy wouldn't be able to cope with</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you were saying.</v>

1980
01:32:53.650 --> 01:32:54.483
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1981
01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:56.440
<v Speaker 3>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1982
01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:01.560
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any idiot could tell you that that slave</v>

1983
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:04.450
<v Speaker 3>is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1984
01:33:04.451 --> 01:33:05.680
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1985
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:07.870
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

1986
01:33:07.871 --> 01:33:09.160
<v Speaker 3>that's where we're at right now with</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

1987
01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:12.020
<v Speaker 3>Like when I say it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1988
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:13.390
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly we're so.</v>

1989
01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:17.560
<v Speaker 3>Does he aim to stop animal on animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>crime?</v>

1990
01:33:18.130 --> 01:33:20.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked him about that and um,</v>

1991
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:23.440
<v Speaker 3>that was one of the things that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of our conversation,</v>

1992
01:33:23.441 --> 01:33:24.190
<v Speaker 3>I even said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1993
01:33:24.190 --> 01:33:28.870
<v Speaker 3>you got a couple of things you need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>work on because he didn't have a great</v>

1994
01:33:28.871 --> 01:33:30.910
<v Speaker 3>one for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another one that he didn't have a great</v>

1995
01:33:30.911 --> 01:33:32.170
<v Speaker 3>one for his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had</v>

1996
01:33:34.570 --> 01:33:36.580
<v Speaker 3>nothing to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that he ended a great one now that I</v>

1997
01:33:36.581 --> 01:33:38.140
<v Speaker 3>was like trying to stump him because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1998
01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:40.000
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a very intelligent,</v>

1999
01:33:40.001 --> 01:33:42.130
<v Speaker 3>well thought person and very respectful</v>
<v Speaker 3>to people that you talking.</v>

2000
01:33:42.150 --> 01:33:45.070
<v Speaker 3>Do even people that disagree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have nothing but admiration for the</v>

2001
01:33:45.071 --> 01:33:46.590
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we had a,</v>

2002
01:33:46.591 --> 01:33:49.860
<v Speaker 3>a conversation that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I,</v>

2003
01:33:49.861 --> 01:33:54.861
<v Speaker 3>that I was not totally satisfied with</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he has a deal of reverence it</v>

2004
01:33:55.301 --> 01:33:56.740
<v Speaker 3>seems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2005
01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:57.970
<v Speaker 3>at the risk of putting words in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth,</v>

2006
01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:01.120
<v Speaker 3>he has a reverence for like indigenous</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting cultures,</v>

2007
01:34:01.150 --> 01:34:02.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That they had like this sort of respect.</v>

2008
01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:07.390
<v Speaker 3>They had a respect for animals that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have and somehow that made it okay</v>

2009
01:34:07.391 --> 01:34:09.130
<v Speaker 3>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they had a spiritual connection.</v>

2010
01:34:09.250 --> 01:34:11.740
<v Speaker 3>And so that made that okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we don't have that,</v>

2011
01:34:11.741 --> 01:34:14.260
<v Speaker 3>so we're not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I asked them about are you able to</v>

2012
01:34:14.261 --> 01:34:19.261
<v Speaker 3>identify the point in human development</v>
<v Speaker 3>and cultural development?</v>

2013
01:34:20.110 --> 01:34:22.510
<v Speaker 3>What is the point when you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to give up the chase?</v>

2014
01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:27.880
<v Speaker 3>Like at what point do you have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility to stop hunting because</v>

2015
01:34:27.881 --> 01:34:31.900
<v Speaker 3>you're saying that it is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For some people it's absolutely not okay</v>

2016
01:34:31.901 --> 01:34:34.930
<v Speaker 3>for us now when should we have made the</v>
<v Speaker 3>jump?</v>

2017
01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:38.470
<v Speaker 3>Because earlier Tom Bout like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spanish,</v>

2018
01:34:38.770 --> 01:34:41.740
<v Speaker 3>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a situation where the Spanish</v>

2019
01:34:41.741 --> 01:34:45.640
<v Speaker 3>had gone into in the American southwest</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're trying to,</v>

2020
01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:51.030
<v Speaker 3>as they called it civilize southwestern</v>
<v Speaker 3>tribes and they were building homes for</v>

2021
01:34:51.791 --> 01:34:54.580
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to instruct them in religion,</v>

2022
01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 3>trying to create schools for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to provide them with</v>

2023
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:03.130
<v Speaker 2>the tools of the agrarian lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they would write letters back to the</v>

2024
01:35:05.151 --> 01:35:09.410
<v Speaker 2>king complaining about how these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>refuse to stop,</v>

2025
01:35:09.411 --> 01:35:13.040
<v Speaker 2>go hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you give them a chance and he sons</v>

2026
01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:16.130
<v Speaker 2>of bitches take off to go hunt and here</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are giving them everything they need</v>

2027
01:35:16.131 --> 01:35:18.710
<v Speaker 2>to be sedentary and they just won't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the program.</v>

2028
01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.620
<v Speaker 2>So there is this struggle where people</v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

2029
01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:25.910
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think some people expect you,</v>

2030
01:35:25.911 --> 01:35:28.790
<v Speaker 2>like if you're a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think that the end result of</v>

2031
01:35:28.791 --> 01:35:32.960
<v Speaker 2>humanness is that you like wind up not</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>

2032
01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:37.010
<v Speaker 2>that it's sort of the goal of</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations to make you not a hunter.</v>

2033
01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:41.630
<v Speaker 2>And I think he's a little bit guilty of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because he thinks it is okay for</v>

2034
01:35:41.631 --> 01:35:43.610
<v Speaker 2>some people and where he runs into</v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble.</v>

2035
01:35:43.611 --> 01:35:47.840
<v Speaker 2>As he talks about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked him about ethics.</v>

2036
01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:49.700
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the animal doesn't care about your</v>

2037
01:35:49.701 --> 01:35:51.500
<v Speaker 2>ethics to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's dying.</v>

2038
01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:56.730
<v Speaker 2>If he dies and you have a good feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your heart or if he dies and you have</v>

2039
01:35:56.731 --> 01:35:58.500
<v Speaker 2>a bad feeling in your heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's dead.</v>

2040
01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:02.400
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what trip you're on your</v>

2041
01:36:02.410 --> 01:36:05.070
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They suffer the same regardless of your</v>

2042
01:36:05.071 --> 01:36:08.070
<v Speaker 2>motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And which leads me to want to point out,</v>

2043
01:36:08.130 --> 01:36:10.020
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the indigenous cultures that you</v>

2044
01:36:10.021 --> 01:36:11.580
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's okay for them to hunt.</v>

2045
01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Their animals are suffering to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals they killed.</v>

2046
01:36:15.631 --> 01:36:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Don't know that they're being killed by</v>
<v Speaker 2>indigenous peoples and therefore it</v>

2047
01:36:18.541 --> 01:36:20.280
<v Speaker 2>makes the suffering more palatable for</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2048
01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:24.980
<v Speaker 2>They're dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are some traps there that,</v>

2049
01:36:24.990 --> 01:36:27.360
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to me were answered in a</v>

2050
01:36:27.361 --> 01:36:29.160
<v Speaker 2>satisfactory way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does any of that make sense?</v>

2051
01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

2052
01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:35.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a very messy situation if you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to confine behavior that way and</v>

2053
01:36:35.551 --> 01:36:38.550
<v Speaker 1>you want to impart moral judgment on</v>
<v Speaker 1>people because what do you do with</v>

2054
01:36:38.551 --> 01:36:40.440
<v Speaker 1>people with pets?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do it.</v>

2055
01:36:40.441 --> 01:36:41.880
<v Speaker 1>People that have cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he has,</v>

2056
01:36:41.881 --> 01:36:43.860
<v Speaker 1>he has companion animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has some very good.</v>

2057
01:36:43.861 --> 01:36:45.480
<v Speaker 1>He has good stuff to say about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2058
01:36:45.490 --> 01:36:46.600
<v Speaker 1>it was very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So saved.</v>

2059
01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:49.260
<v Speaker 1>What does you have to say with those</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals that are mistreated and confined</v>

2060
01:36:49.261 --> 01:36:51.780
<v Speaker 1>and ground up in the food?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't like that,</v>

2061
01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.440
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you feel.</v>

2062
01:36:53.490 --> 01:36:55.410
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine,</v>

2063
01:36:56.290 --> 01:36:57.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel,</v>

2064
01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:58.600
<v Speaker 1>I feel kind of like you can feed your</v>
<v Speaker 1>cats,</v>

2065
01:36:58.601 --> 01:37:03.090
<v Speaker 1>have a vegan diet and I would imagine in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my act about it because I got into it</v>

2066
01:37:03.091 --> 01:37:05.670
<v Speaker 1>because I found out I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got harassed by someone online and I</v>

2067
01:37:05.671 --> 01:37:09.420
<v Speaker 1>went to their twitter page and it said</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag Vegan cat and I went,</v>

2068
01:37:09.421 --> 01:37:12.720
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be fucking kidding me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I found this entire community</v>

2069
01:37:12.721 --> 01:37:15.450
<v Speaker 1>of people that feed their cats vegan</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

2070
01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:18.810
<v Speaker 1>The problem is the cats go blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They die</v>

2071
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:20.760
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't,</v>

2072
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:22.830
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't that interested in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

2073
01:37:22.890 --> 01:37:24.480
<v Speaker 2>And when I was saying to him like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you,</v>

2074
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:29.010
<v Speaker 2>do you feel that we should separate</v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory animals from pray and put them</v>

2075
01:37:29.011 --> 01:37:31.460
<v Speaker 2>on like a soy diet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just thought I'll.</v>

2076
01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:35.160
<v Speaker 2>And I don't understand why he felt that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was being like ridiculous for the sake.</v>

2077
01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Well it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how you're going to see those stats.</v>

2078
01:37:37.631 --> 01:37:38.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a real quick question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2079
01:37:38.951 --> 01:37:39.820
<v Speaker 1>why you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2080
01:37:39.821 --> 01:37:42.400
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taking this cat and you're</v>

2081
01:37:42.401 --> 01:37:44.860
<v Speaker 1>putting this cat above the animals that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it eats.</v>

2082
01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Your deciding that these chickens and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fish and all the different things</v>

2083
01:37:47.711 --> 01:37:49.420
<v Speaker 1>that you need to grind up to make cat</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

2084
01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:53.590
<v Speaker 1>That's okay because you love this cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a hierarchy of animal life and</v>

2085
01:37:53.591 --> 01:37:55.680
<v Speaker 1>we all have a hierarchy of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegans.</v>

2086
01:37:55.681 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I've seen</v>

2087
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.110
<v Speaker 5>vegans slap mosquitoes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen it.</v>

2088
01:37:58.470 --> 01:38:01.140
<v Speaker 5>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen them kill ants.</v>

2089
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:03.090
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a lady I used to live near</v>

2090
01:38:03.091 --> 01:38:05.280
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>The lady that ran the Ashram was</v>

2091
01:38:05.370 --> 01:38:08.310
<v Speaker 5>spraying bug spray with the from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a Buddhist temple.</v>

2092
01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:11.340
<v Speaker 5>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she was still live in a house next</v>

2093
01:38:11.341 --> 01:38:11.800
<v Speaker 5>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2094
01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:12.960
<v Speaker 5>next door to it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry.</v>

2095
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:15.420
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>

2096
01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:18.870
<v Speaker 5>she used to spray bug spray on the ants</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was like,</v>

2097
01:38:18.871 --> 01:38:21.210
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck you on the ant on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>answer to kill the ants.</v>

2098
01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:23.040
<v Speaker 5>She was killing him and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing?</v>

2099
01:38:23.041 --> 01:38:23.581
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2100
01:38:23.581 --> 01:38:26.040
<v Speaker 5>we don't like to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they get into our food and like,</v>

2101
01:38:26.041 --> 01:38:30.210
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're a vegetarian who's committed</v>

2102
01:38:30.211 --> 01:38:33.230
<v Speaker 5>to a Buddhist life of do no harm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yet you're,</v>

2103
01:38:33.630 --> 01:38:36.540
<v Speaker 5>there's no way around this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to poison these fucking ends</v>

2104
01:38:36.690 --> 01:38:40.050
<v Speaker 5>with death from the sky that comes out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of these containers.</v>

2105
01:38:40.051 --> 01:38:43.680
<v Speaker 5>These metal containers is aerosol</v>
<v Speaker 5>containers of death.</v>

2106
01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:46.170
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is a bizarre lines that we</v>

2107
01:38:46.171 --> 01:38:49.410
<v Speaker 5>draw,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as long as I am putting my,</v>

2108
01:38:49.450 --> 01:38:52.110
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>taken the liberty of putting myself in</v>

2109
01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:54.840
<v Speaker 5>Robert and Joe and Wethis is Robert</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jones,</v>

2110
01:38:54.841 --> 01:38:57.630
<v Speaker 5>his position,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that he would have some</v>

2111
01:38:57.631 --> 01:39:02.631
<v Speaker 5>interesting stuff to say about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about this conversation we're having</v>

2112
01:39:03.631 --> 01:39:06.360
<v Speaker 5>when we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because some harm happens.</v>

2113
01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:11.460
<v Speaker 5>Then let's just say fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we'll open up the gates.</v>

2114
01:39:11.490 --> 01:39:12.061
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2115
01:39:12.061 --> 01:39:16.740
<v Speaker 5>but let's talk about life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is his life in a small form more</v>

2116
01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:20.160
<v Speaker 5>insignificant or less significant than</v>
<v Speaker 5>an elk?</v>

2117
01:39:21.090 --> 01:39:23.280
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who decides that an ant is less</v>

2118
01:39:23.281 --> 01:39:25.440
<v Speaker 5>significant than an hour?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I shoot one elk,</v>

2119
01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:27.870
<v Speaker 5>I can eat it for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one life,</v>

2120
01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:30.990
<v Speaker 5>one life for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't like ants getting on your</v>

2121
01:39:30.991 --> 01:39:35.310
<v Speaker 5>peanut butter and Jelly Sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you spray a whole colony of these</v>

2122
01:39:35.311 --> 01:39:38.550
<v Speaker 5>fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've killed thousands of life forces.</v>

2123
01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:40.520
<v Speaker 5>And even ruling out the insect thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've ever,</v>

2124
01:39:40.530 --> 01:39:43.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a guy that wrote a,</v>

2125
01:39:43.050 --> 01:39:45.180
<v Speaker 5>a pretty scathing review.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he might've been,</v>

2126
01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:46.170
<v Speaker 5>it might've been.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I came,</v>

2127
01:39:46.171 --> 01:39:48.330
<v Speaker 5>remember it was in the Wall Street</v>
<v Speaker 5>Journal or somewhere you,</v>

2128
01:39:48.331 --> 01:39:51.510
<v Speaker 5>this guy wrote a pretty scathing review</v>
<v Speaker 5>of my third book and,</v>

2129
01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:57.240
<v Speaker 5>and there is like just the number of</v>
<v Speaker 5>animals this guy has killed about me.</v>

2130
01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:01.710
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember thinking if you go and get a</v>

2131
01:40:01.711 --> 01:40:06.660
<v Speaker 5>12 pack of mcnuggets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many chickens,</v>

2132
01:40:07.810 --> 01:40:12.810
<v Speaker 5>how you sorted out the parts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're probably eating hundreds of</v>

2133
01:40:13.681 --> 01:40:15.360
<v Speaker 5>chickens probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2134
01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:16.650
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all scraps.</v>

2135
01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:19.050
<v Speaker 5>It's emulsified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scrap.</v>

2136
01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:20.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not like,</v>

2137
01:40:20.710 --> 01:40:22.470
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to take this chicken here</v>

2138
01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:25.530
<v Speaker 5>and we're going to produce 30 nuggets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2139
01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:28.650
<v Speaker 5>my problem is they never turned that</v>
<v Speaker 5>force on themselves.</v>

2140
01:40:28.651 --> 01:40:32.400
<v Speaker 5>They never turned that high powered</v>
<v Speaker 5>vision of,</v>

2141
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:34.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the consequences of their actions on</v>

2142
01:40:34.291 --> 01:40:36.300
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If someone's talking about like,</v>

2143
01:40:36.301 --> 01:40:39.060
<v Speaker 5>if this guy is a Vegan and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetarian and he's talking about how</v>

2144
01:40:39.061 --> 01:40:41.430
<v Speaker 5>many animals you've killed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many animals are you responsible</v>

2145
01:40:41.431 --> 01:40:42.480
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for your fucking,</v>

2146
01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:45.330
<v Speaker 5>your whole wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't even,</v>

2147
01:40:45.690 --> 01:40:46.530
<v Speaker 5>he wasn't he.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was.</v>

2148
01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:47.960
<v Speaker 5>So he was a mediator.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2149
01:40:47.970 --> 01:40:50.280
<v Speaker 5>that's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's Ricky Gervais'.</v>

2150
01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:54.240
<v Speaker 5>It's Ricky Gervais' constantly talks</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunters</v>

2151
01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:59.480
<v Speaker 1>and hunting the guy who eats meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's so many weird laws and I,</v>

2152
01:41:00.441 --> 01:41:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I get it that he doesn't think people</v>
<v Speaker 1>should hunt animals just for trophies.</v>

2153
01:41:04.330 --> 01:41:07.210
<v Speaker 1>And I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very rarely do these animals</v>

2154
01:41:07.211 --> 01:41:09.240
<v Speaker 1>get hunted just for trophies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like can you,</v>

2155
01:41:09.241 --> 01:41:13.170
<v Speaker 1>if you shoot a fucking elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the village eats the elephant when</v>

2156
01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:16.180
<v Speaker 1>you're feeding hundreds of people with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that elephant.</v>

2157
01:41:16.190 --> 01:41:19.610
<v Speaker 3>And I'll point out too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I do all the time pro elephant</v>

2158
01:41:19.670 --> 01:41:21.230
<v Speaker 3>shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's illegal.</v>

2159
01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:21.700
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2160
01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:25.510
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to talk about yellowstone</v>

2161
01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.420
<v Speaker 3>syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost,</v>

2162
01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:28.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm almost having a personal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2163
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:31.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking a couple year long break from</v>

2165
01:41:36.210 --> 01:41:38.660
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The your article that you wrote was one</v>

2166
01:41:38.661 --> 01:41:42.500
<v Speaker 1>of my favorite on that subject and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was right around the time that the</v>

2167
01:41:42.501 --> 01:41:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Cecil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion thing was going down and it</v>

2168
01:41:45.021 --> 01:41:48.520
<v Speaker 1>also referenced that Kendall Jones girl</v>
<v Speaker 1>who uh,</v>

2169
01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:50.430
<v Speaker 1>got a lot of hate online because she</v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

2170
01:41:50.710 --> 01:41:53.380
<v Speaker 1>she was a Texas cheerleader and she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>really cute and I think</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people hate a good looking woman hunting</v>

<v Speaker 3>in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Smile on her face and do not.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to go a lot.</v>

<v Speaker 3>People are like,</v>

2179
01:42:13.071 --> 01:42:16.070
<v Speaker 3>If you're over there and you're shooting</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Kudu and you're going to eat it and</v>

01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:30.740
<v Speaker 3>We spent a lot of time talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy because for instance,</v>

2185
01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:33.740
<v Speaker 3>we have a camera guy who worked with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rick Smith,</v>

<v Speaker 3>has a long professional history and</v>
<v Speaker 3>working with wildlife,</v>

2187
01:42:37.190 --> 01:42:40.160
<v Speaker 3>filming wildlife and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't grow up hunting.</v>

2188
01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2191
01:42:44.301 --> 01:42:47.300
<v Speaker 3>he's curious about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he asked a lot of good questions and</v>

2192
01:42:47.301 --> 01:42:51.600
<v Speaker 3>we were looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had killed a Moose and um,</v>

2193
01:42:51.650 --> 01:42:53.090
<v Speaker 3>the next day it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were up in,</v>

2194
01:42:53.091 --> 01:42:54.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Alaska.</v>

2195
01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:57.350
<v Speaker 3>We killed a moose in the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We rolled our camp and having to go near</v>

2196
01:42:57.351 --> 01:43:02.351
<v Speaker 3>there and there was a wolverine dragging</v>
<v Speaker 3>off Moose parts when you talked about</v>

2197
01:43:02.571 --> 01:43:04.070
<v Speaker 3>this on your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2198
01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:05.810
<v Speaker 3>it's great story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rick was like,</v>

2199
01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:10.100
<v Speaker 3>and you're allowed in that area between</v>
<v Speaker 3>September one and March 31st you're</v>

2200
01:43:10.101 --> 01:43:11.210
<v Speaker 3>allowed to kill your lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2202
01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:15.520

<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2203
01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:18.650
<v Speaker 3>he has eaten and enjoys wolverine meat</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the hides,</v>

2204
01:43:18.651 --> 01:43:20.620
<v Speaker 3>as we all know what phenomenal the</v>
<v Speaker 3>height.</v>

2205
01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:24.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we all know that well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>digital listening to this,</v>

2206
01:43:24.610 --> 01:43:29.410
<v Speaker 3>like we all know traditionally parkers</v>
<v Speaker 3>are trimmed with Wolverine because</v>

2207
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:32.880
<v Speaker 3>Wolverine will not freeze up when Scott</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frost on it by trim,</v>

2208
01:43:32.890 --> 01:43:34.310
<v Speaker 3>demean the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the hood,</v>

2209
01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:35.173
<v Speaker 3>around the hood.</v>

2210
01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:36.710
<v Speaker 3>When your exhale and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2211
01:43:37.670 --> 01:43:38.830
<v Speaker 3>stuff gets fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will Ring.</v>

2212
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:40.100
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't frost up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2213
01:43:40.130 --> 01:43:41.110
<v Speaker 3>So is that going to be used?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2214
01:43:41.111 --> 01:43:43.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why it was a hollow hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know what it is about it</v>

2215
01:43:43.791 --> 01:43:45.560
<v Speaker 3>that it resists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This fraud resists for us.</v>

2216
01:43:45.561 --> 01:43:47.240
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're kicking around.</v>

2217
01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:48.610
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

2218
01:43:48.610 --> 01:43:50.600
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First day we didn't shoot the bull ring</v>

2219
01:43:50.601 --> 01:43:52.260
<v Speaker 3>but we were just about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2220
01:43:52.270 --> 01:43:55.400
<v Speaker 3>we legally could have gone and take a</v>
<v Speaker 3>crack at it.</v>

2221
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:57.680
<v Speaker 3>Did you have an opportunity to do so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2222
01:43:57.900 --> 01:44:00.890
<v Speaker 3>we would have had to have acted quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yes.</v>

2223
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:03.590
<v Speaker 3>Or You could have staked it out and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>waited for him to come back because he</v>

2224
01:44:03.591 --> 01:44:04.940
<v Speaker 3>wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a little thief.</v>

2225
01:44:05.210 --> 01:44:06.980
<v Speaker 3>He's stealing your Moose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we already butchered it.</v>

2226
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:08.990
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was taking the hooves.</v>

2227
01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:09.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2228
01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:10.520
<v Speaker 3>Guts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2229
01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:13.250
<v Speaker 3>But you're a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's taken bone.</v>

2230
01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.950
<v Speaker 3>He actually stole two our marathons</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we then have the fucker cause</v>

2231
01:44:15.951 --> 01:44:16.820
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we took,</v>

2232
01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:21.940
<v Speaker 3>we took the four big marrow bones and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>wound up getting over on another night</v>

2233
01:44:22.881 --> 01:44:26.180
<v Speaker 3>at dark and stoled some of our marrow</v>
<v Speaker 3>bones out of our cash.</v>

2234
01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:28.910
<v Speaker 3>But we didn't see it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyhow,</v>

2235
01:44:28.970 --> 01:44:32.720
<v Speaker 3>Rick's point now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you should mess with like,</v>

2236
01:44:32.721 --> 01:44:35.950
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an animal that I think is off and</v>

2237
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:36.660
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is that?</v>

2238
01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:37.041
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2239
01:44:37.041 --> 01:44:39.710
<v Speaker 3>they Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things he was talking about,</v>

2240
01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:40.581
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2241
01:44:40.581 --> 01:44:42.320
<v Speaker 3>they cover so much ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2242
01:44:42.710 --> 01:44:43.930
<v Speaker 3>they'll have a home range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2243
01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:46.640
<v Speaker 3>they'll go 250 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2244
01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:49.400
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we just killed a Caribou and Caribou</v>

2245
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:54.110
<v Speaker 3>go a thousand miles hundreds of miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not distance traveled.</v>

2246
01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:56.300
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a,</v>

2247
01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:57.930
<v Speaker 3>it's just something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2248
01:44:58.060 --> 01:44:59.180
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2249
01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:00.710
<v Speaker 3>it's just something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2250
01:45:00.711 --> 01:45:02.660
<v Speaker 3>people are pairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

2251
01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:05.300
<v Speaker 3>The way you describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charismatic megafauna.</v>

2252
01:45:05.330 --> 01:45:05.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2253
01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:07.340
<v Speaker 3>that's not my term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a great.</v>

2254
01:45:07.341 --> 01:45:10.090
<v Speaker 3>I hats off to whoever did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you could find out who invented</v>

2255
01:45:10.091 --> 01:45:12.500
<v Speaker 3>the charismatic megafauna there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>attributed to you.</v>

2256
01:45:12.501 --> 01:45:13.730
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to leave it with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2257
01:45:13.731 --> 01:45:16.130
<v Speaker 3>I didn't come up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard a linguist one day.</v>

2258
01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:19.070
<v Speaker 3>You could find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hurdle linguists one day talking about,</v>

2259
01:45:19.190 --> 01:45:19.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2260
01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:21.800
<v Speaker 3>he was interested in tracking where</v>
<v Speaker 3>things come from.</v>

2261
01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:23.450
<v Speaker 3>That would be an easy case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2262
01:45:23.451 --> 01:45:28.451
<v Speaker 3>what he was interested in tracking was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>waitresses saying,</v>

2263
01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:30.410
<v Speaker 3>are you still working on that?</v>

2264
01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:36.710
<v Speaker 3>Because there was a time when no one</v>
<v Speaker 3>said that and then all of a sudden</v>

2265
01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:41.000
<v Speaker 3>everyone said it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was interested.</v>

2266
01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:43.070
<v Speaker 3>Where did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you still working on that?</v>

2267
01:45:43.071 --> 01:45:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Come from the one mouth that it first</v>
<v Speaker 3>came out of.</v>

2268
01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:46.730
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>

2269
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:50.330
<v Speaker 3>Charismatic megaphone is great and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that there's some things are so</v>

2270
01:45:50.331 --> 01:45:55.331
<v Speaker 3>charismatic wolves and grizzlies that</v>
<v Speaker 3>like New Jersey cat ladies know about</v>

2271
01:45:57.411 --> 01:45:58.610
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that?</v>

2272
01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:01.730
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the billboard that they were all cecil,</v>

2273
01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:07.310
<v Speaker 3>there was a lion hugging a bear that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to stop the bear hunt in New</v>

2274
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.730
<v Speaker 3>Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2275
01:46:07.730 --> 01:46:10.050
<v Speaker 3>he never saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that you don't even guy someone,</v>

2276
01:46:10.051 --> 01:46:10.731
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pedals,</v>

2277
01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:13.520
<v Speaker 3>the bear as Sherman's shot pedals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How rude.</v>

2278
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:17.630
<v Speaker 3>Like whenever something like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>

2279
01:46:17.631 --> 01:46:18.464
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember reading it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>right when it came out like a fish and</v>

2281
01:46:21.411 --> 01:46:23.780

<v Speaker 3>he had obvious injuries in his front</v>

01:46:49.251 --> 01:46:50.490
<v Speaker 3>not uncommon and probably,</v>

2292
01:46:50.490 --> 01:46:53.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be a lot of the things we have</v>

2293
01:46:53.011 --> 01:46:53.841
<v Speaker 2>about harming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2294
01:46:53.841 --> 01:46:54.900
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like large,</v>

2295
01:46:54.901 --> 01:46:56.730
<v Speaker 2>mysterious and it's could come from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2296
01:46:56.731 --> 01:46:58.290
<v Speaker 2>obviously bears walking around their</v>
<v Speaker 2>back feet.</v>

2297
01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:00.900
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey had their.</v>

2298
01:47:00.901 --> 01:47:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Have they haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say I don't want to have</v>

2299
01:47:04.730 --> 01:47:08.730
<v Speaker 2>this mean too many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have a exploding population of</v>

2300
01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:10.590
<v Speaker 2>black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always reluctant to say something's</v>

2301
01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:13.630
<v Speaker 2>overpopulated because you always got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask like according to whose definition</v>

2302
01:47:14.110 --> 01:47:16.010
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the automobile insurance comp</v>

2303
01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:18.540
<v Speaker 2>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they'll say everything's over</v>

2304
01:47:18.541 --> 01:47:20.520
<v Speaker 2>populated that you might run over with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your car.</v>

2305
01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Agricultural interests have a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of overpopulated,</v>

2306
01:47:23.551 --> 01:47:26.340
<v Speaker 2>so they have a shitload of bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fair statement.</v>

2307
01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:29.670
<v Speaker 2>They had a hunting season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turns out some guy comes into a check</v>

2308
01:47:29.671 --> 01:47:33.690
<v Speaker 2>station and he had shot this bear that</v>
<v Speaker 2>walks around on his back feet and they'd</v>

2309
01:47:33.691 --> 01:47:37.770
<v Speaker 2>given him the name pedals because he'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken two scavenging bird feeders and</v>

2310
01:47:37.771 --> 01:47:38.700
<v Speaker 2>stuff around the neighborhood.</v>

2311
01:47:39.090 --> 01:47:40.890
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can't remember the magazine,</v>

2312
01:47:40.891 --> 01:47:44.010
<v Speaker 2>one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those dip shitty a New York</v>

2313
01:47:44.011 --> 01:47:48.780
<v Speaker 2>online magazines and just basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>coles basically steals shit out of the</v>

2314
01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:50.850
<v Speaker 2>New York Times and writes its own</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretations of New York Times</v>

2315
01:47:50.851 --> 01:47:53.790
<v Speaker 2>articles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't Gawk or something like that.</v>

2316
01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Said that pedals had been assassinated?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2317
01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read that.</v>

2318
01:48:00.201 --> 01:48:04.080
<v Speaker 2>But what are those websites that all</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do is like hack on traditional</v>

2319
01:48:04.081 --> 01:48:06.330
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they just write articles</v>

2320
01:48:06.331 --> 01:48:08.700
<v Speaker 2>commenting on traditional media stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2321
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:13.790
<v Speaker 2>but they're not generating leads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at this billboard ban the</v>

2322
01:48:13.801 --> 01:48:15.780
<v Speaker 2>bear hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bear all seesaw.</v>

2323
01:48:15.781 --> 01:48:17.040
<v Speaker 2>They're crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're crying,</v>

2324
01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:21.150
<v Speaker 2>they have cartoon tears like literal and</v>
<v Speaker 2>look how the bears hugging or the line</v>

2325
01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:24.030
<v Speaker 2>rather is hugging the bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poor babies.</v>

2326
01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a nice billboard.</v>

2327
01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2328
01:48:28.050 --> 01:48:29.640
<v Speaker 2>what about pedals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2329
01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:34.790
<v Speaker 2>the people that get the charismatic</v>
<v Speaker 2>megafauna because another that we talked</v>

2330
01:48:35.071 --> 01:48:36.090
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our podcast recently,</v>

2331
01:48:36.091 --> 01:48:38.150
<v Speaker 2>we had a biologist on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2332
01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:40.550
<v Speaker 2>who works for the Kalispell tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2333
01:48:41.850 --> 01:48:46.850
<v Speaker 2>Indian tribe and that historically you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were in Idaho portions of Washington and</v>

2334
01:48:48.781 --> 01:48:49.770
<v Speaker 2>portions of Montana.</v>

2335
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're very involved and Caribou</v>

2336
01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:56.550
<v Speaker 2>Mountain Caribou recovery in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So most people do not know that.</v>

2337
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional,</v>

2338
01:48:58.910 --> 01:49:01.950
<v Speaker 2>traditional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a Caribou population that drifted</v>

2339
01:49:01.951 --> 01:49:06.300
<v Speaker 2>down from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drifted from Canada down into northern</v>

2340
01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>northern Idaho,</v>

2341
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:11.190
<v Speaker 2>northwest Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have that now at all.</v>

2342
01:49:11.250 --> 01:49:12.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was about a dozen of them.</v>

2343
01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:15.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right at this moment that we're talking</v>

2344
01:49:15.121 --> 01:49:17.370
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some,</v>

2345
01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:21.330
<v Speaker 2>a couple miles from the US border inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>

2346
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:26.980
<v Speaker 2>but there used to be the last legal one</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be killed wasn't.</v>

2347
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:30.450
<v Speaker 2>It was back in the 19 twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened in was just disturbances</v>

2348
01:49:30.451 --> 01:49:32.360
<v Speaker 2>that habitat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2349
01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:34.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was always a small,</v>

2350
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:38.610
<v Speaker 2>not a large number of them and we had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of things that mess with their</v>

2351
01:49:38.611 --> 01:49:40.890
<v Speaker 2>travel corridors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>development road,</v>

2352
01:49:40.891 --> 01:49:44.240
<v Speaker 2>construction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>logging activities and now they,</v>

2353
01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:49.030
<v Speaker 2>they rarely ever drift down into the US,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as an active recovery area there.</v>

2354
01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:54.060
<v Speaker 2>So we got about a dozen Caribou that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>contenders to be in theU ,</v>

2355
01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:59.200
<v Speaker 2>s net sometimes we'll actually crossed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and come into the US in the selkirk</v>

2356
01:49:59.201 --> 01:50:02.680
<v Speaker 2>mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one gives a shit</v>

2357
01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:05.900
<v Speaker 4>about mountain Caribou.</v>

2358
01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:12.210
<v Speaker 2>The amount of like energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of mental energy that goes</v>

2359
01:50:12.211 --> 01:50:17.211
<v Speaker 2>into people's favorite animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the expense of other good projects.</v>

2360
01:50:20.801 --> 01:50:23.410
<v Speaker 2>We could be other good wildlife projects</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could be working on.</v>

2361
01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:27.580
<v Speaker 2>Kind of boggles my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black bears you have.</v>

2362
01:50:27.610 --> 01:50:31.120
<v Speaker 2>So we have enough black bears that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have black bear hunting seasons and I</v>

2363
01:50:31.121 --> 01:50:32.530
<v Speaker 2>think 36 states.</v>

2364
01:50:33.630 --> 01:50:34.463
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2365
01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Rapidly expanding population of black</v>
<v Speaker 2>bears and people will spend enormous</v>

2366
01:50:39.631 --> 01:50:44.631
<v Speaker 2>amounts of energy and resources because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I don't understand it and</v>

2367
01:50:45.121 --> 01:50:47.550
<v Speaker 2>they're just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they just like are willfully</v>

2368
01:50:47.551 --> 01:50:51.450
<v Speaker 2>ignorant about other wildlife issues</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are much more important because</v>

2369
01:50:51.451 --> 01:50:52.770
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not cuddly.</v>

2370
01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:54.750
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't look fuzzy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2371
01:50:54.751 --> 01:50:57.420
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a stuffed one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is.</v>

2372
01:50:57.450 --> 01:50:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Stuffed Teddy bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of it.</v>

2373
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.823
<v Speaker 2>The what</v>

2374
01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:02.980
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've gotten accustomed to thinking of</v>

2375
01:51:02.981 --> 01:51:05.410
<v Speaker 1>these things is our friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Yogi bear.</v>

2376
01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:08.890
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done these anthropomorphization</v>

2377
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:13.600
<v Speaker 1>with these cartoons and television shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's ingrained in the consciousness</v>

2378
01:51:13.601 --> 01:51:15.280
<v Speaker 1>of a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what you do,</v>

2379
01:51:15.281 --> 01:51:16.620
<v Speaker 1>you can't get it out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2380
01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:19.960
<v Speaker 1>there's some legitimate differences</v>
<v Speaker 1>between animals.</v>

2381
01:51:19.961 --> 01:51:21.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about that yesterday.</v>

2382
01:51:21.770 --> 01:51:25.210
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about the differences</v>
<v Speaker 1>between bears and deer.</v>

2383
01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Like deer looks at you in a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks at you.</v>

2384
01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:31.300
<v Speaker 1>You know about how when I was talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the show about whitetail deer,</v>

2385
01:51:31.301 --> 01:51:33.100
<v Speaker 1>it's like catching the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You in a way,</v>

2386
01:51:33.101 --> 01:51:34.500
<v Speaker 1>nothing has ever looked at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at you.</v>

2387
01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:36.550
<v Speaker 1>That's their electric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their eyes are like,</v>

2388
01:51:36.570 --> 01:51:37.391
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2389
01:51:37.391 --> 01:51:38.590
<v Speaker 1>you're there to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

2390
01:51:38.591 --> 01:51:39.940
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking person.</v>

2391
01:51:39.941 --> 01:51:44.020
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or a bear looks at you like going on</v>

2392
01:51:44.021 --> 01:51:45.310
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I eat you?</v>

2393
01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Can you eat me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2394
01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:51.160
<v Speaker 1>there's like a weird sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship that people have with</v>

2395
01:51:51.161 --> 01:51:53.240
<v Speaker 1>bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they look at you and.</v>

2396
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:56.980
<v Speaker 1>But they don't look at you with the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of intense fear that a game animal</v>

2397
01:51:56.981 --> 01:51:57.814
<v Speaker 1>looks at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2398
01:51:57.980 --> 01:52:02.980
<v Speaker 1>There's this blurring of the lines there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that when we think of</v>

2399
01:52:03.941 --> 01:52:07.390
<v Speaker 1>animals that we eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have very distinct classifications.</v>

2400
01:52:07.391 --> 01:52:08.740
<v Speaker 1>You tell people you eat bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

2401
01:52:08.741 --> 01:52:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did,</v>

2402
01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:14.050
<v Speaker 1>you know when the first hunts that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to take me on was black bear hunt?</v>

2403
01:52:14.051 --> 01:52:14.681
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2404
01:52:14.681 --> 01:52:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took some getting used to.</v>

2405
01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm like,</v>

2406
01:52:18.011 --> 01:52:21.260
<v Speaker 1>when we go on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go get some blueberry bears.</v>

2407
01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

2408
01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:24.331
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2409
01:52:24.331 --> 01:52:25.930
<v Speaker 2>I have the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the same problem.</v>

2410
01:52:25.931 --> 01:52:30.720
<v Speaker 2>Why do I do create a hierarchy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also try to like question where</v>

2411
01:52:30.721 --> 01:52:33.000
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchy has come from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes from.</v>

2412
01:52:33.001 --> 01:52:38.001
<v Speaker 2>And to suss out contradiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the only problem to me where it gets</v>

2413
01:52:38.161 --> 01:52:43.110
<v Speaker 2>problematic for me is the way that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it seems that you can get some</v>

2414
01:52:43.111 --> 01:52:45.060
<v Speaker 2>American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so excited about</v>

2415
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:52.030
<v Speaker 2>preventing any kind of exploitation of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>handful of species,</v>

2416
01:52:52.450 --> 01:52:55.510
<v Speaker 2>yet there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet they remain completely uninvolved</v>

2417
01:52:56.530 --> 01:52:57.490
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

2418
01:52:58.910 --> 01:53:02.510
<v Speaker 2>with the the issues and politics and</v>
<v Speaker 2>recovery efforts of other things that</v>

2419
01:53:02.590 --> 01:53:05.120
<v Speaker 2>needed really that need it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2420
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:09.290
<v Speaker 2>You know the fact that with wolves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>grid like certain populations of grizzly</v>

2421
01:53:09.291 --> 01:53:12.200
<v Speaker 2>bears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain populations of wolves have</v>

2422
01:53:12.201 --> 01:53:15.140
<v Speaker 2>reached recovery objective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet we still cover them on the</v>

2423
01:53:15.141 --> 01:53:18.590
<v Speaker 2>endangered species act because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are wanting to use the endangered</v>

2424
01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:22.400
<v Speaker 2>species act to save things from any</v>
<v Speaker 2>threat of exploitation at all,</v>

2425
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:25.010
<v Speaker 2>like nothing to do with what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing to do with what the legislation</v>

2426
01:53:25.011 --> 01:53:26.450
<v Speaker 2>was meant for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's become.</v>

2427
01:53:26.730 --> 01:53:31.190
<v Speaker 2>It's become the favorite animal act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you want to initiate something</v>

2428
01:53:31.191 --> 01:53:34.760
<v Speaker 2>called the favor animal act and try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it passed by Congress,</v>

2429
01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:39.880
<v Speaker 2>feel free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't steal the ESA and take it away</v>

2430
01:53:40.431 --> 01:53:45.110
<v Speaker 2>from its intended purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In order to protect your stuffed animal</v>

2431
01:53:45.111 --> 01:53:45.340
<v Speaker 2>animal</v>

2432
01:53:45.340 --> 01:53:48.130
<v Speaker 1>sales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a very important point on one of</v>

2433
01:53:48.131 --> 01:53:50.830
<v Speaker 1>your podcast where you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>population numbers,</v>

2434
01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:53.710
<v Speaker 1>population objectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you were saying that will like if</v>

2435
01:53:53.711 --> 01:53:56.470
<v Speaker 1>you look at a elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2436
01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:00.890
<v Speaker 1>in some places elk are extremely common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2437
01:54:00.970 --> 01:54:03.700
<v Speaker 1>in Colorado for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more elk in Colorado that I</v>

2438
01:54:03.701 --> 01:54:05.160
<v Speaker 1>think any other state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

2439
01:54:05.230 --> 01:54:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Bye Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of almost like a factor too.</v>

2440
01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:09.670
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you tell people in Colorado that</v>

2441
01:54:09.671 --> 01:54:10.660
<v Speaker 1>elk are in danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2442
01:54:10.661 --> 01:54:12.880
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to Florida.</v>

2443
01:54:12.970 --> 01:54:15.850
<v Speaker 1>There's no elk and elk are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wolves,</v>

2444
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:16.690
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2445
01:54:16.690 --> 01:54:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Elk are gone from 90 percent of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>historic range in the US.</v>

2446
01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety percent.</v>

2447
01:54:21.670 --> 01:54:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Yet no one has a problem with elk</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting seasons,</v>

2448
01:54:25.630 --> 01:54:26.890
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2449
01:54:27.310 --> 01:54:28.780
<v Speaker 1>But them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>

2450
01:54:28.850 --> 01:54:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Who is eating wolves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2451
01:54:30.730 --> 01:54:32.550
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Wolf Dog.</v>

2452
01:54:32.610 --> 01:54:35.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's an arctic explorer as</v>

2453
01:54:35.491 --> 01:54:37.810
<v Speaker 1>his favorite wild meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's loved?</v>

2454
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a psycho dude.</v>

2455
01:54:39.131 --> 01:54:40.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ate two carpaccio.</v>

2456
01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:43.800
<v Speaker 2>He ate a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they found a.</v>

2457
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:46.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a desiccated</v>

2458
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:52.480

<v Speaker 2>And it had been like in the,</v>

2459
01:54:52.690 --> 01:54:57.690
<v Speaker 2>in the salt and its tongue was dried out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he cut the tongue out and he said</v>

2460
01:54:58.471 --> 01:55:00.270
<v Speaker 2>the how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They boiled repeatedly,</v>

2461
01:55:00.271 --> 01:55:02.430
<v Speaker 2>repeatedly tried to get the salt out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually ate it.</v>

2462
01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:05.430
<v Speaker 2>And then he ran into some eskimo hunters</v>
<v Speaker 2>who said that thing been laying there</v>

2463
01:55:05.431 --> 01:55:06.264

01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2465
01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:13.610
<v Speaker 1>He was hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck did he eat in three year</v>

2466
01:55:13.611 --> 01:55:14.444
<v Speaker 1>old tongue.</v>

2467
01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:16.440
<v Speaker 2>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just kept boiling it and rebounded.</v>

2468
01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Do it hit anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to do,</v>

2469
01:55:18.930 --> 01:55:20.540

<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

2470
01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:24.170
<v Speaker 2>He made Stevinson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a book my life with the Eskimo.</v>

2471
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:28.970
<v Speaker 2>So he made first contact with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the High Arctic.</v>

2472
01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:34.840
<v Speaker 2>They knew he was meeting people who knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>about whites but hadn't met and yet.</v>

2473
01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:37.340
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was funny about this dude is</v>

2474
01:55:37.341 --> 01:55:42.170
<v Speaker 2>how frustrated he would get with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to show him his shit,</v>

2475
01:55:42.171 --> 01:55:43.860
<v Speaker 2>which he thought they'd be blown away</v>
<v Speaker 2>by.</v>

2476
01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:48.360
<v Speaker 2>So He'd let get out a gun or one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one days.</v>

2477
01:55:48.361 --> 01:55:49.980

2478
01:55:49.981 --> 01:55:50.521
<v Speaker 2>my people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2479
01:55:50.521 --> 01:55:51.990
<v Speaker 2>we can do surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What year was this?</v>

2480
01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:55.580
<v Speaker 2>He was making first contact and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>early 19 hundreds of Blake,</v>

2481
01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:59.610
<v Speaker 2>like coronation goal Victoria island up</v>
<v Speaker 2>open the Canadian High Arctic again.</v>

2482
01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:03.210
<v Speaker 2>They knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they knew that there was whites.</v>

2483
01:56:03.211 --> 01:56:06.360
<v Speaker 2>They hadn't met any whites yet and he'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to them and um,</v>

2484
01:56:06.810 --> 01:56:08.370
<v Speaker 2>he'd expect blown way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>

2485
01:56:08.371 --> 01:56:13.080
<v Speaker 2>he shows some guys his firearm has gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this dude's like,</v>

2486
01:56:13.081 --> 01:56:14.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

2487
01:56:14.730 --> 01:56:19.730
<v Speaker 2>But I know a guy that can shoot his bow</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his error will travel to the far</v>

2488
01:56:21.031 --> 01:56:23.640
<v Speaker 2>side of the mountain and kill a care</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

2489
01:56:23.641 --> 01:56:27.750
<v Speaker 2>you can't even see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or he was saying we can do surgery on</v>

2490
01:56:27.751 --> 01:56:30.450
<v Speaker 2>people do an appendectomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

2491
01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:36.320
<v Speaker 2>I know a guy that can take your whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>spine and skull and brain out and put it</v>

2492
01:56:37.381 --> 01:56:41.700
<v Speaker 2>back in again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about telescopes and he's</v>

2493
01:56:41.701 --> 01:56:43.920
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see the moon craters.</v>

2494
01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:46.140
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know guys been to the moon</v>

2495
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:52.910
<v Speaker 2>in haunted there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one upmanship dude.</v>

2496
01:56:53.911 --> 01:56:55.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the greatest book man.</v>

2497
01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:58.830
<v Speaker 2>How frustrated he gets from one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool things he describes as a,</v>

2498
01:56:59.430 --> 01:57:02.550
<v Speaker 2>he describes how they would kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2499
01:57:02.551 --> 01:57:07.551
<v Speaker 2>when they killed a polar bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would bring the head back and put</v>

2500
01:57:07.591 --> 01:57:10.360
<v Speaker 2>in their lodge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of like,</v>

2501
01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:13.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to draw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't want to push this too far,</v>

2502
01:57:13.141 --> 01:57:16.380
<v Speaker 2>but much in the same way you might bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>a head home and hanging on your wall.</v>

2503
01:57:16.410 --> 01:57:19.230
<v Speaker 2>They would bring it home and put in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their lodge and the thinking has</v>

2504
01:57:19.231 --> 01:57:24.231
<v Speaker 2>explained to staff and some was that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm bringing him home so that he can</v>

2505
01:57:24.361 --> 01:57:29.361
<v Speaker 2>observe me and my family</v>
<v Speaker 2>and see that we're good people.</v>

2506
01:57:31.650 --> 01:57:36.650
<v Speaker 2>And when he goes to the afterlife he</v>
<v Speaker 2>will tell other bears if you got to get</v>

2507
01:57:36.811 --> 01:57:39.840
<v Speaker 2>killed by somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a bad guy to have it happen.</v>

2508
01:57:41.010 --> 01:57:41.843
<v Speaker 2>That guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2509
01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:46.560
<v Speaker 2>And I often point out about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the animal skulls and hides in my own</v>

2510
01:57:46.561 --> 01:57:47.810
<v Speaker 2>home that I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2511
01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:50.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to make myself seem to</v>
<v Speaker 2>spirits will in some ways I,</v>

2512
01:57:50.531 --> 01:57:54.900
<v Speaker 2>I think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of that with the animals.</v>

2513
01:57:54.901 --> 01:57:57.780
<v Speaker 2>I haven't in my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a concept that you run in your</v>

2514
01:57:57.781 --> 01:57:58.560
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

2515
01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:00.090
<v Speaker 2>that I run in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about him.</v>

2516
01:58:00.220 --> 01:58:01.140
<v Speaker 2>Why was I talking about step?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2517
01:58:01.141 --> 01:58:04.110
<v Speaker 2>loved wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he ate every damn thing like Muskox,</v>

2518
01:58:04.111 --> 01:58:05.790
<v Speaker 2>Caribou,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walrus.</v>

2519
01:58:05.791 --> 01:58:08.430
<v Speaker 2>He ate everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in talks repeatedly about his</v>

2520
01:58:08.431 --> 01:58:11.370
<v Speaker 2>preference for wolf meet preference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Above all,</v>

2521
01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:13.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read my life with the Eskimo.</v>

2522
01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ate a coyote.</v>

2523
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:15.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that like?</v>

2524
01:58:15.691 --> 01:58:16.524
<v Speaker 2>Didn't like it.</v>

2525
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:21.570
<v Speaker 2>But here's the problem that I've run</v>
<v Speaker 2>into because I in,</v>

2526
01:58:21.580 --> 01:58:25.380
<v Speaker 2>in Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I a fair bit of domestic dog.</v>

2527
01:58:25.381 --> 01:58:30.381
<v Speaker 2>I Caio and I know monkey red howler</v>
<v Speaker 2>monkey.</v>

2528
01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Those are my big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my big transgressions of me.</v>

2529
01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:36.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all,</v>

2530
01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:37.920
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I admitted earlier to having my own</v>

2531
01:58:37.921 --> 01:58:41.160
<v Speaker 2>animal hierarchies and those were the</v>
<v Speaker 2>times when I've sort of strayed</v>

2532
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:46.560
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable ground for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm canines and hominids or they hominid</v>

2533
01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:48.480
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a harm in primate primate.</v>

2534
01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:50.670
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2535
01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:53.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2536
01:58:53.431 --> 01:58:54.910
<v Speaker 2>I get like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2537
01:58:54.970 --> 01:58:56.590
<v Speaker 2>I get where I can't really tell what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>tastes like.</v>

2538
01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:00.230
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult to tell what it actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>taste like because you're feeling that</v>

2539
01:59:00.231 --> 01:59:03.340
<v Speaker 2>there's so many other things going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions,</v>

2540
01:59:03.370 --> 01:59:06.280
<v Speaker 2>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>contributions and and I get like a hot,</v>

2541
01:59:07.390 --> 01:59:09.450
<v Speaker 2>a hot guilty feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>

2542
01:59:09.610 --> 01:59:14.610
<v Speaker 2>But when I was in Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they described dog as a hot food and I</v>

2543
01:59:15.971 --> 01:59:18.400
<v Speaker 2>kept asking him what that meant because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really understand but it does</v>

2544
01:59:18.401 --> 01:59:19.660
<v Speaker 2>it like makes me sweaty.</v>

2545
01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:22.700
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was like a guilt thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people would,</v>

2546
01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:26.410
<v Speaker 2>they would eat it and serve it around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the holidays.</v>

2547
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:29.620
<v Speaker 2>So the lunar new year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was auspicious.</v>

2548
01:59:29.621 --> 01:59:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Suspicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's auspicious to eat dog meat in the</v>

2549
01:59:34.030 --> 01:59:37.030
<v Speaker 2>days leading up to the lunar new year</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a game.</v>

2550
01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:41.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a food that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a risky enterprise and summer.</v>

2551
01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam is kind of a risky enterprise to</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat deer and it'd be like a dog.</v>

2552
01:59:48.010 --> 01:59:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to eat dog.</v>

2553
01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:52.360
<v Speaker 2>And it's like some of the people like</v>
<v Speaker 2>these restaurants open up that are only</v>

2554
01:59:52.361 --> 01:59:56.560
<v Speaker 2>open that time of year and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>people coming in to like bring in good</v>

2555
01:59:56.561 --> 01:59:57.970
<v Speaker 2>luck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>risky enterprise.</v>

2556
01:59:57.971 --> 02:00:02.971
<v Speaker 2>How so a guy told me that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the guys I interviewed told me</v>

2557
02:00:04.781 --> 02:00:09.781
<v Speaker 2>that he was unable to get his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's unable to have children and they</v>

2558
02:00:10.001 --> 02:00:11.710
<v Speaker 2>determined that it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was on him.</v>

2559
02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:13.360
<v Speaker 2>His wife was fertile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was infertile.</v>

2560
02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:16.360
<v Speaker 2>He ate dog</v>

2561
02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:21.510
<v Speaker 2>and it changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His fortunes have changed his luck and</v>

2562
02:00:21.511 --> 02:00:25.170
<v Speaker 2>he got his wife pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he says,</v>

2563
02:00:25.171 --> 02:00:30.171
<v Speaker 2>I will not eat dog again for fear that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would undo what I did.</v>

2564
02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:34.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a powerful food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a sentiment held more in the</v>

2565
02:00:34.981 --> 02:00:39.810
<v Speaker 2>north than in the held more like I spent</v>
<v Speaker 2>time in Hanoi and I spent time in Saigon</v>

2566
02:00:39.811 --> 02:00:42.570
<v Speaker 2>or Ho Chi Minh City as the sentiment</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was expressed,</v>

2567
02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:47.600
<v Speaker 2>more like in more of a semi spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 2>way in the north than it was in the</v>

2568
02:00:49.261 --> 02:00:49.981
<v Speaker 2>south.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2569
02:00:49.981 --> 02:00:54.130
<v Speaker 2>a translator that I had hired a told me</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat dark.</v>

2570
02:00:55.450 --> 02:00:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2571
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:59.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a dark.</v>

2572
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:06.030
<v Speaker 2>I went to his house to see his dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come in and the dog is in a small cage</v>

2573
02:01:08.170 --> 02:01:10.540
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exaggerating.</v>

2574
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I say it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2575
02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:14.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was probably maybe two feet by</v>
<v Speaker 2>three and a half feet</v>

2576
02:01:15.890 --> 02:01:20.590
<v Speaker 2>and it's a wire mesh cage and there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a drip pan below it basically to</v>

2577
02:01:20.591 --> 02:01:25.591
<v Speaker 2>collect the animal's waste and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a bowl of rice in the dog,</v>

2578
02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:30.790
<v Speaker 2>just goes ape shit and when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we come in and it just like looking</v>

2579
02:01:30.791 --> 02:01:32.200
<v Speaker 2>at the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just was not,</v>

2580
02:01:32.260 --> 02:01:34.510
<v Speaker 2>it just did not seem like a well dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2581
02:01:35.290 --> 02:01:37.080
<v Speaker 2>I said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2582
02:01:37.630 --> 02:01:40.160
<v Speaker 2>and he lives like a very busy in Hanoi,</v>

2583
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:44.150
<v Speaker 3>like you walk out and it's just the full</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam may him scooters.</v>

2584
02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:46.490
<v Speaker 3>It's just like insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said to him,</v>

2585
02:01:46.850 --> 02:01:49.700
<v Speaker 3>so you just take them out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can just go walk them</v>

2586
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:51.623
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

2587
02:01:52.150 --> 02:01:54.160
<v Speaker 3>And he kind of looks at me like he</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't understand when talking about.</v>

2588
02:01:55.110 --> 02:01:59.860
<v Speaker 3>And it turns out that that dog hadn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>been out of that cage since he brought</v>

2589
02:01:59.861 --> 02:02:03.190
<v Speaker 3>it home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was his pet dog,</v>

2590
02:02:03.191 --> 02:02:05.920
<v Speaker 3>which he kept like a parakeet Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ.</v>

2591
02:02:06.070 --> 02:02:09.130
<v Speaker 3>He said I wouldn't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now conversely,</v>

2592
02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:14.790
<v Speaker 3>in the training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went out to a farm.</v>

2593
02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:17.400
<v Speaker 3>There were a guy has a small plot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>land,</v>

2594
02:02:17.450 --> 02:02:19.620
<v Speaker 3>he's there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have like a,</v>

2595
02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:23.790
<v Speaker 3>basically there's was system there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the you have very poor farmers who don't</v>

2596
02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:25.530
<v Speaker 3>own the land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's state owned land,</v>

2597
02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:28.860
<v Speaker 3>government own land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have subsistence farms and this</v>

2598
02:02:28.861 --> 02:02:32.670
<v Speaker 3>guy raised a sugar cane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had an air gun,</v>

2599
02:02:32.671 --> 02:02:35.220
<v Speaker 3>you can't have a regular gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had an air gun and he would hunt</v>

2600
02:02:35.221 --> 02:02:36.150
<v Speaker 3>various,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2601
02:02:36.270 --> 02:02:40.740
<v Speaker 3>arboreal marsupial's and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and things to eat and he had some water</v>

2602
02:02:40.741 --> 02:02:45.030
<v Speaker 3>river flowing through his place and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a small amount of livestock and</v>

2603
02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:48.120
<v Speaker 3>raise some crops and peppers and various</v>
<v Speaker 3>things and he had a bunch of dogs</v>

2604
02:02:48.121 --> 02:02:50.940
<v Speaker 3>running around on his place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just pet dogs.</v>

2605
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:56.510
<v Speaker 3>He was explaining to me that now and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then when the dogs are bred up to a</v>

2606
02:02:57.511 --> 02:03:02.511
<v Speaker 3>number that's hard to support them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dog buyer comes and the dog buyer</v>

2607
02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:07.200
<v Speaker 3>will give you some cash for your excess</v>
<v Speaker 3>dog population.</v>

2608
02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:12.560
<v Speaker 3>And those are the dogs that go into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>markets of Vietnam.</v>

2609
02:03:14.250 --> 02:03:17.250
<v Speaker 3>Other countries actually have places</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they're like breeding and rearing</v>

2610
02:03:17.251 --> 02:03:19.740
<v Speaker 3>dogs for slaughter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was the Vietnamese system.</v>

2611
02:03:21.150 --> 02:03:25.020
<v Speaker 3>So it might've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have many interesting things about</v>

2612
02:03:25.021 --> 02:03:29.970
<v Speaker 3>this whole thing is about being like</v>
<v Speaker 3>comparing like this guy's pet to this</v>

2613
02:03:29.971 --> 02:03:32.760
<v Speaker 3>guy's livestock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sort of got into this thing as which</v>

2614
02:03:32.761 --> 02:03:36.150
<v Speaker 3>is the more enviable position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is more enviable position</v>

2615
02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:39.310
<v Speaker 3>livestock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take that life over.</v>

2616
02:03:39.311 --> 02:03:41.910
<v Speaker 3>Then living in the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shitting onto like a great.</v>

2617
02:03:42.330 --> 02:03:47.330
<v Speaker 3>And I went to visit a guy that actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wholesaler who buys the dogs from</v>

2618
02:03:49.921 --> 02:03:54.330
<v Speaker 3>farmers on the countryside and he comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>back and they fatten.</v>

2619
02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:57.840
<v Speaker 3>They would fatten the dogs on beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stomach beef trim.</v>

2620
02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Basically the stuff that in the US we</v>
<v Speaker 3>send a rendering plants.</v>

2621
02:04:01.371 --> 02:04:01.901
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when,</v>

2622
02:04:01.901 --> 02:04:03.510
<v Speaker 3>when when they slaughter cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost everything,</v>

2623
02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:05.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once the meats gone,</v>

2624
02:04:05.161 --> 02:04:06.330
<v Speaker 3>everything goes to a rendering plant.</v>

2625
02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:10.050
<v Speaker 3>He would buy basically what us</v>
<v Speaker 3>production facility send to a rendering</v>

2626
02:04:10.051 --> 02:04:11.550
<v Speaker 3>plant and that's what he would fatten</v>
<v Speaker 3>dog on.</v>

2627
02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:17.100
<v Speaker 3>And you'd go to the markets and they'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>have dogs stack like just dog part</v>

2628
02:04:17.101 --> 02:04:20.730
<v Speaker 3>stacked up pyramids at the market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was bizarre to see man,</v>

2629
02:04:20.731 --> 02:04:25.500
<v Speaker 3>and I'll tell you I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went out in different places and with</v>

2630
02:04:25.501 --> 02:04:30.501
<v Speaker 3>different people and different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went out for seven nights in a row and</v>

2631
02:04:30.511 --> 02:04:35.511
<v Speaker 3>I could never get beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could never get beyond my own biases</v>

2632
02:04:37.710 --> 02:04:42.150
<v Speaker 3>about what's food and what's not food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just like very difficult for me</v>

2633
02:04:42.151 --> 02:04:47.151
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to eat it and fake my way through and it</v>

2634
02:04:47.351 --> 02:04:49.860
<v Speaker 3>was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I do understand when people come to</v>

2635
02:04:49.861 --> 02:04:50.820
<v Speaker 3>me and they're looking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

2636
02:04:50.821 --> 02:04:51.810
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bear,</v>

2637
02:04:52.290 --> 02:04:52.920
<v Speaker 3>like in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2638
02:04:52.920 --> 02:04:54.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 100.</v>

2639
02:04:54.261 --> 02:04:56.820
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've 100 grade I've hunted and eaten</v>

2640
02:04:56.910 --> 02:04:58.680
<v Speaker 3>hundreds and hundreds of pounds of black</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear meat.</v>

2641
02:04:58.890 --> 02:05:00.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people come in,</v>

2642
02:05:00.961 --> 02:05:01.381
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2643
02:05:01.381 --> 02:05:03.800
<v Speaker 3>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to act like that.</v>

2644
02:05:03.810 --> 02:05:05.880
<v Speaker 3>They're coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people come to me and express</v>

2645
02:05:05.890 --> 02:05:07.680
<v Speaker 3>disapproval,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2646
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:11.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to act like I can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand where they're coming from</v>

2647
02:05:11.790 --> 02:05:13.580
<v Speaker 3>because I had the same thing I felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2648
02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:15.330
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever making the argument.</v>

2649
02:05:15.331 --> 02:05:17.450
<v Speaker 3>I never fact checked it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel it is.</v>

2650
02:05:17.610 --> 02:05:22.610
<v Speaker 3>There are more people in this world who</v>
<v Speaker 3>live in a country where it's socially</v>

2651
02:05:23.671 --> 02:05:25.950
<v Speaker 3>acceptable to eat dog meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The not.</v>

2652
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:32.030
<v Speaker 3>I haven't formally fact check that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember looking at some basic</v>

2653
02:05:32.431 --> 02:05:34.020
<v Speaker 3>figures and thinking that that was true.</v>

2654
02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that we choose to not</v>

2655
02:05:35.981 --> 02:05:39.310
<v Speaker 1>eat pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pigs are probably as intelligent if</v>

2656
02:05:39.311 --> 02:05:41.590
<v Speaker 1>not more to choose to eat pigs rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2657
02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Probably as intelligent or more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs.</v>

2658
02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dogs are probably more dangerous</v>

2659
02:05:49.121 --> 02:05:51.330
<v Speaker 1>when they're feral than pigs are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2660
02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>When pigs are feral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they generally avoid people.</v>

2661
02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:56.710
<v Speaker 1>When dogs are feral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they known always.</v>

2662
02:05:56.711 --> 02:06:00.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was an instance a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago outside of Atlanta were an</v>

2663
02:06:00.490 --> 02:06:04.510
<v Speaker 1>elderly couple was attacked and someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>was killed by wild dogs.</v>

2664
02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:06.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Australian Dingo traces back to</v>

2665
02:06:06.921 --> 02:06:11.540
<v Speaker 3>being a is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a dog who knows it's ancestry to,</v>

2666
02:06:11.700 --> 02:06:14.450
<v Speaker 3>to human activities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's it really.</v>

2667
02:06:14.530 --> 02:06:16.390
<v Speaker 1>So it used to be a domesticated animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2668
02:06:16.391 --> 02:06:18.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very early form.</v>

2669
02:06:18.190 --> 02:06:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check that out.</v>

2670
02:06:20.591 --> 02:06:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Make sure I'm right about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the,</v>

2671
02:06:21.940 --> 02:06:23.740
<v Speaker 1>what the genetic history that Dingo is.</v>

2672
02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:25.420
<v Speaker 3>What's their wild dog called?</v>

2673
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Dingo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dingo.</v>

2674
02:06:27.110 --> 02:06:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2675
02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:30.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's some kind of a.</v>

2676
02:06:30.511 --> 02:06:34.110
<v Speaker 1>it's like a dog breed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably Find Adam Green tree holding</v>

2677
02:06:34.111 --> 02:06:35.440
<v Speaker 1>one up by his ankles to the fucking</v>

2678
02:06:36.810 --> 02:06:37.670
<v Speaker 6>bowl</v>

2679
02:06:38.970 --> 02:06:40.550
<v Speaker 1>arrow hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a wild dog.</v>

2680
02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Says wild but lupus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's,</v>

2681
02:06:43.770 --> 02:06:45.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his ancestry?</v>

2682
02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just google dingoes were once domestic</v>

2683
02:06:51.551 --> 02:06:55.590
<v Speaker 1>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dingo domesticated animal.</v>

2684
02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:02.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at the genetic status origin</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2685
02:07:02.311 --> 02:07:06.180
<v Speaker 3>I'll just pull it up so you can see</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indian wolf and Arabian Wolf evolved</v>

2686
02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:07.033
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

2687
02:07:07.180 --> 02:07:08.870
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here.</v>

2688
02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:11.180
<v Speaker 3>Mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't feel like I'm wrong.</v>

2689
02:07:13.770 --> 02:07:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2690
02:07:14.900 --> 02:07:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Widely held.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dingoes have evolved from the Indian</v>

2691
02:07:19.281 --> 02:07:19.791
<v Speaker 1>Wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2692
02:07:19.791 --> 02:07:21.230
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>6,000,</v>

2693
02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:25.910
<v Speaker 1>10,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bread from a was assumed for all</v>

2694
02:07:25.911 --> 02:07:29.100
<v Speaker 1>domestic dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The theory was based on the</v>

2695
02:07:29.420 --> 02:07:34.420
<v Speaker 1>morphological similarities of the Dingo</v>
<v Speaker 1>skulls and the skulls of the subspecies</v>

2696
02:07:34.670 --> 02:07:38.050
<v Speaker 1>of wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Genetic analysis indicated that a much</v>

2697
02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:40.060
<v Speaker 1>earlier domestication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2698
02:07:40.810 --> 02:07:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is a domestication.</v>

2699
02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:44.770
<v Speaker 1>New study suggests dingoes may have in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the south China.</v>

2700
02:07:45.130 --> 02:07:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have humans.</v>

2701
02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were originally domesticated and</v>

2702
02:07:49.661 --> 02:07:51.510
<v Speaker 1>then cut loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2703
02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:52.421
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2704
02:07:52.421 --> 02:07:53.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told you,</v>

2705
02:07:53.721 --> 02:07:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have my own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my own thing about bear and then I</v>

2706
02:07:57.310 --> 02:07:59.980
<v Speaker 1>hunted bear and eight bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that thing went away.</v>

2707
02:08:00.050 --> 02:08:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2708
02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:04.450
<v Speaker 1>It's just been this what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still doesn't seem the same to me</v>

2709
02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:06.640
<v Speaker 1>as like a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

2710
02:08:06.670 --> 02:08:07.780
<v Speaker 1>if you gave me a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2711
02:08:07.781 --> 02:08:09.430
<v Speaker 1>would you rather go hon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Axis deer,</v>

2712
02:08:09.431 --> 02:08:12.670
<v Speaker 1>which I've never hunted seems so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more natural to me.</v>

2713
02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Think go hunt black bear.</v>

2714
02:08:14.610 --> 02:08:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2715
02:08:16.590 --> 02:08:20.880
<v Speaker 2>I have such a complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a complicated sets of feelings about</v>

2716
02:08:21.690 --> 02:08:25.830
<v Speaker 2>black bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a hunter strange,</v>

2717
02:08:25.831 --> 02:08:30.831
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten to the thing where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe before I even say I'm going to say</v>

2718
02:08:31.221 --> 02:08:36.221
<v Speaker 2>why it's not quite strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have found that a lot of big game</v>

2719
02:08:36.351 --> 02:08:37.184
<v Speaker 2>hunters</v>

2720
02:08:37.810 --> 02:08:38.643
<v Speaker 4>will</v>

2721
02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:44.500
<v Speaker 2>do some amount of bear hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a couple of bears and then drift</v>

2722
02:08:45.291 --> 02:08:49.740
<v Speaker 2>away from bear hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2723
02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:53.620
<v Speaker 2>they still respect how difficult it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how much you can learn about</v>

2724
02:08:53.621 --> 02:08:58.240
<v Speaker 2>barriers by fine at blop you have gotten</v>
<v Speaker 2>some bears are always excited to go on a</v>

2725
02:08:58.241 --> 02:09:00.430
<v Speaker 2>bear hunt if it's someone's first</v>

2726
02:09:01.770 --> 02:09:02.603
<v Speaker 4>bear hunt,</v>

2727
02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:04.581
<v Speaker 2>like to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2728
02:09:04.581 --> 02:09:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I have no desire if you want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to go along.</v>

2729
02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:11.420
<v Speaker 2>But it's something to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But whereas like something like elk,</v>

2730
02:09:12.350 --> 02:09:15.380
<v Speaker 2>the more you get and the more you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you want to get in,</v>

2731
02:09:15.381 --> 02:09:16.214
<v Speaker 2>the more you want to eat.</v>

2732
02:09:16.290 --> 02:09:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't,</v>

2733
02:09:17.251 --> 02:09:20.160
<v Speaker 1>you think that's a public pressure thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>though in a lot of ways about bears</v>

2734
02:09:20.430 --> 02:09:23.160
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've described even to my friends about</v>

2735
02:09:23.161 --> 02:09:26.310
<v Speaker 1>hunting bear and that just put their</v>
<v Speaker 1>head back like they're fine with me</v>

2736
02:09:26.311 --> 02:09:27.420
<v Speaker 1>hunting deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fine with me.</v>

2737
02:09:27.421 --> 02:09:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Hunting pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody seems to be in supportive</v>

2738
02:09:29.371 --> 02:09:30.260
<v Speaker 1>hunting pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2739
02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:31.590
<v Speaker 2>You know how my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2740
02:09:31.590 --> 02:09:36.590
<v Speaker 2>my brother put the bear thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the conundrum for him and it's</v>

2741
02:09:36.631 --> 02:09:39.330
<v Speaker 2>pretty simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bear.</v>

2742
02:09:39.331 --> 02:09:42.360
<v Speaker 2>Has a very beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very usable hide.</v>

2743
02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know like deer hides.</v>

2744
02:09:46.230 --> 02:09:48.270
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can throw it through a process,</v>

2745
02:09:48.271 --> 02:09:52.170
<v Speaker 2>you can get like a buck skin from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get some deer hides,</v>

2746
02:09:52.171 --> 02:09:55.730
<v Speaker 2>you can get a pretty good usable leather</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2747
02:09:55.740 --> 02:09:57.900
<v Speaker 2>that the use used to make apparel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2748
02:09:58.110 --> 02:10:00.240
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows Daniel Boone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2749
02:10:00.630 --> 02:10:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Daniel Boone was a much of his life was</v>
<v Speaker 2>spent in the business of trading deer</v>

2750
02:10:05.911 --> 02:10:07.680
<v Speaker 2>hides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daniel Boone was a commercial hunter.</v>

2751
02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:12.360
<v Speaker 2>He will go out and shoot white tail deer</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the summer when their hides were thin</v>

2752
02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:15.090
<v Speaker 2>and sell them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was used for industrial work</v>

2753
02:10:15.091 --> 02:10:20.091
<v Speaker 2>where it was used for work apparel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like basically the 17 fifties version of</v>

2754
02:10:21.361 --> 02:10:24.770
<v Speaker 2>carhartt close was made out of deer hide</v>
<v Speaker 2>summer.</v>

2755
02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Dear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not familiar with that term.</v>

2756
02:10:26.011 --> 02:10:27.510

<v Speaker 2>Carhartt jackets,</v>

<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

2762
02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2763
02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:36.930
<v Speaker 3>I never heard a carhartt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This same thing with Jamie.</v>

2764
02:10:37.630 --> 02:10:39.320
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like work pants.</v>

2765
02:10:39.321 --> 02:10:41.720
<v Speaker 3>He got like a little holster for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hammer and shut up inside of them.</v>

2766
02:10:41.721 --> 02:10:42.554
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2767
02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:44.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm so used to make them out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buckskin.</v>

2768
02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:45.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like work,</v>

2769
02:10:45.711 --> 02:10:48.020
<v Speaker 3>work apparel and his time was making</v>
<v Speaker 3>bucks again.</v>

2770
02:10:48.290 --> 02:10:50.750
<v Speaker 3>Those things smelled great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the day I'll do.</v>

2771
02:10:50.751 --> 02:10:54.710
<v Speaker 3>My Dad had my dad saved a lot of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>deer and had a uh,</v>

2772
02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:58.100
<v Speaker 3>an had a sport coat made out of his own</v>
<v Speaker 3>deer and do that thing was amazing and</v>

2773
02:10:58.101 --> 02:10:59.620
<v Speaker 3>smelled good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2774
02:10:59.621 --> 02:11:02.390
<v Speaker 3>I'll do as a nicest jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's dead.</v>

2775
02:11:02.391 --> 02:11:04.280
<v Speaker 3>I should find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should go dig around and stuff and</v>

2776
02:11:04.281 --> 02:11:07.460
<v Speaker 3>find that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was dyed black is beautiful coat,</v>

2777
02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:09.860
<v Speaker 3>but it hadn't had one mate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've shot a lot of deer.</v>

2778
02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:12.560
<v Speaker 3>Well that wasn't good at is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2779
02:11:13.070 --> 02:11:14.950
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes you can do stuff with,</v>

2780
02:11:14.970 --> 02:11:19.970
<v Speaker 3>but it's not really in today's age of</v>
<v Speaker 3>other fabrics is not practical.</v>

2781
02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:25.160
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bear hide has timeless beauty and</v>

2782
02:11:25.161 --> 02:11:27.920
<v Speaker 3>timeless application.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever thought about making a</v>

2783
02:11:27.921 --> 02:11:30.020
<v Speaker 3>jacket at a bear hide?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2784
02:11:30.230 --> 02:11:31.130
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2785
02:11:31.180 --> 02:11:32.840
<v Speaker 3>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because what I was doing for a long time</v>

2786
02:11:32.841 --> 02:11:36.500
<v Speaker 3>was saving up my bear hides and I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>to cut them into like nine or 10 inch</v>

2787
02:11:36.501 --> 02:11:40.850
<v Speaker 3>squares and have a very large conflict</v>
<v Speaker 3>are made out of many different bears cut</v>

2788
02:11:40.851 --> 02:11:45.320
<v Speaker 3>into squares stitched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't given up on that idea,</v>

2789
02:11:45.590 --> 02:11:48.620
<v Speaker 3>but I give a lot of my bear hides away</v>
<v Speaker 3>to people who really liked them anyway.</v>

2790
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:53.270
<v Speaker 3>When you get a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like no one in their right mind</v>

2791
02:11:53.330 --> 02:11:55.010
<v Speaker 3>gets rid of a bear hide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2792
02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:58.940
<v Speaker 3>So you get one and you get a Tan and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you've got to bear hide.</v>

2793
02:11:59.330 --> 02:12:02.030
<v Speaker 3>And once you got to bear hide and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on the floor and then you got bear</v>

2794
02:12:02.031 --> 02:12:04.820
<v Speaker 3>hide over the back of the couch and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to bear hide hanging on the wall,</v>

2795
02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:07.620
<v Speaker 3>you get to a point where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2796
02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:12.920
<v Speaker 3>you don't need any more bear hides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you eat the meat and you have the</v>

2797
02:12:12.921 --> 02:12:15.860
<v Speaker 3>highest but you don't need more bear</v>
<v Speaker 3>hides and when you get a bear there's an</v>

2798
02:12:15.861 --> 02:12:20.600
<v Speaker 3>expense to getting the high prepared but</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel wasteful not using the height.</v>

2799
02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:22.850
<v Speaker 3>So it was very hard to shoot a bear just</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>

2800
02:12:23.150 --> 02:12:25.280
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you feel like you're wasting</v>

2801
02:12:25.281 --> 02:12:27.320
<v Speaker 3>something that people really want and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's beautiful.</v>

2802
02:12:27.321 --> 02:12:29.570
<v Speaker 3>And people like to use the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decorate their homes and use it as a</v>

2803
02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:33.750
<v Speaker 3>totem of the wild as opposed to a white</v>
<v Speaker 3>tail deer with very few people do</v>

2804
02:12:33.751 --> 02:12:34.550
<v Speaker 3>anything with the highest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2805
02:12:34.550 --> 02:12:37.640
<v Speaker 3>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one day Danny was like the last</v>

2806
02:12:37.641 --> 02:12:41.470
<v Speaker 3>bear he got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got up to the bear and,</v>

2807
02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:45.080
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and found himself just kinda.</v>

2808
02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:46.700
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't,</v>

2809
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:48.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2810
02:12:49.310 --> 02:12:52.960
<v Speaker 3>like I look at it and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have like a set of obligations that</v>

2811
02:12:52.961 --> 02:12:57.500
<v Speaker 3>this animal now and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not excited about it anymore.</v>

2812
02:12:57.501 --> 02:13:00.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't want another bear hide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2813
02:13:00.051 --> 02:13:01.440
<v Speaker 3>it's an expense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he just,</v>

2814
02:13:01.490 --> 02:13:03.350
<v Speaker 3>he never killed another bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2815
02:13:03.590 --> 02:13:05.570
<v Speaker 3>He's got some bear hides and he loves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he just,</v>

2816
02:13:05.571 --> 02:13:08.390
<v Speaker 3>he just got to where he's got enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>other stuff to eat.</v>

2817
02:13:08.391 --> 02:13:10.490
<v Speaker 3>He's a moose snob.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He killed a moose every year.</v>

2818
02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:12.400
<v Speaker 3>Likes the moose meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2819
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:14.030
<v Speaker 3>feeds his family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moves,</v>

2820
02:13:14.031 --> 02:13:16.070
<v Speaker 3>feeds his family salmon primarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2821
02:13:16.071 --> 02:13:18.140
<v Speaker 3>if he kills a moose every year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other problem with that is you're</v>

2822
02:13:18.141 --> 02:13:20.630
<v Speaker 3>talking about like 600 pounds of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2823
02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:21.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a family of four.</v>

2824
02:13:21.771 --> 02:13:24.450
<v Speaker 3>He Burns through it plus let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat.</v>

2825
02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:25.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2826
02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:27.800
<v Speaker 3>but that's just kinda like where he got</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

2827
02:13:27.801 --> 02:13:29.060
<v Speaker 3>I knew a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>

2828
02:13:29.061 --> 02:13:31.770
<v Speaker 3>I used to hunt bears and my other</v>
<v Speaker 3>brother and then he don't.</v>

2829
02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.390
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he like when he's out at his,</v>

2830
02:13:34.490 --> 02:13:37.110
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he's out at his wife's ranch,</v>

2831
02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:40.200
<v Speaker 2>he'll see bears running around during</v>
<v Speaker 2>bear sees and he doesn't even think</v>

2832
02:13:40.201 --> 02:13:42.300
<v Speaker 2>about going hunting for him and he used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hunt bears.</v>

2833
02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:44.940
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you just quit.</v>

2834
02:13:44.970 --> 02:13:48.090
<v Speaker 2>You just quit wanting to hunt bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite episodes of yours was</v>

2835
02:13:48.091 --> 02:13:52.470
<v Speaker 2>on the Prince of Wales Island where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a bear in your site and just</v>

2836
02:13:52.471 --> 02:13:53.910
<v Speaker 2>decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to shoot this bear.</v>

2837
02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like I,</v>

2838
02:13:56.611 --> 02:13:59.040
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy watching them.</v>

2839
02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:01.010
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy making smoke.</v>

2840
02:14:01.011 --> 02:14:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Black Bear Hams out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

2841
02:14:02.941 --> 02:14:04.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2842
02:14:04.521 --> 02:14:05.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2843
02:14:05.250 --> 02:14:06.930
<v Speaker 2>would you ever do that with any other</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal though?</v>

2844
02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:09.000
<v Speaker 2>Do what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at it and say,</v>

2845
02:14:09.001 --> 02:14:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to shoot this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you saw mature,</v>

2846
02:14:11.130 --> 02:14:14.280
<v Speaker 2>a mature mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>180 inch mule deer.</v>

2847
02:14:14.730 --> 02:14:16.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2848
02:14:16.110 --> 02:14:17.700
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2849
02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:19.760
<v Speaker 2>But I could picture like with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2850
02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:24.800
<v Speaker 2>you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a handful of animals that</v>

2851
02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:30.700
<v Speaker 2>you know what it is you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of is,</v>

2852
02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:35.880
<v Speaker 2>one of the things is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't help but watch a bear if I'm out</v>

2853
02:14:37.420 --> 02:14:40.170
<v Speaker 2>and I glass up a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2854
02:14:40.171 --> 02:14:42.850
<v Speaker 2>when I say out glass up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like if I'm sitting on a big</v>

2855
02:14:42.851 --> 02:14:45.090
<v Speaker 2>glass and tin or glass and knob up some</v>
<v Speaker 2>highway,</v>

2856
02:14:45.130 --> 02:14:48.640
<v Speaker 2>have a commanding view of the lands</v>
<v Speaker 2>glassing meaning use your binoculars to</v>

2857
02:14:48.641 --> 02:14:51.460
<v Speaker 2>look at the landscape the way that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way I generally hunt.</v>

2858
02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:56.050
<v Speaker 2>I hunt a lot of open country in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>American west and then Alaska and things</v>

2859
02:14:56.051 --> 02:14:58.420
<v Speaker 2>where you have good visibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2860
02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:03.960
<v Speaker 2>the bulk of the time I spent hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spend on a good lookout point,</v>

2861
02:15:05.140 --> 02:15:07.120
<v Speaker 2>a high point where you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2862
02:15:07.121 --> 02:15:09.520
<v Speaker 2>a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred 80 degree view or maybe not</v>

2863
02:15:09.521 --> 02:15:11.300
<v Speaker 2>always 108,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes three 60,</v>

2864
02:15:11.650 --> 02:15:13.390
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a commanding view of the surrounding</v>

2865
02:15:13.391 --> 02:15:14.224
<v Speaker 2>landscape.</v>

2866
02:15:14.410 --> 02:15:19.410
<v Speaker 2>And we generally hunt by sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and observing a with binoculars and just</v>

2867
02:15:23.771 --> 02:15:24.610
<v Speaker 2>watching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching,</v>

2868
02:15:24.611 --> 02:15:28.150
<v Speaker 2>watching to the point where sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll spend days doing nothing but</v>

2869
02:15:28.151 --> 02:15:32.020
<v Speaker 2>watching animals through binoculars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2870
02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:33.660
<v Speaker 2>and when you get good at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2871
02:15:33.700 --> 02:15:37.270
<v Speaker 2>you find animals that people would never</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a million years find that other</v>

2872
02:15:37.271 --> 02:15:40.930
<v Speaker 2>people would never in a million years</v>
<v Speaker 2>locate when I'm doing that and I find a</v>

2873
02:15:40.931 --> 02:15:45.931
<v Speaker 2>bear and I'm observing a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2874
02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:51.870
<v Speaker 2>I would never leave that bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go do some other thing.</v>

2875
02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:55.760
<v Speaker 2>When you find a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I find a bear,</v>

2876
02:15:55.790 --> 02:16:00.790
<v Speaker 2>I watch him until he's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't turn away from them because I</v>

2877
02:16:00.941 --> 02:16:05.941
<v Speaker 2>always feel like at any point he's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do some amazing thing that would blow</v>

2878
02:16:06.581 --> 02:16:07.301
<v Speaker 2>your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2879
02:16:07.301 --> 02:16:10.420
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like crush something skull.</v>

2880
02:16:10.630 --> 02:16:13.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>

2881
02:16:13.620 --> 02:16:17.920
<v Speaker 2>they like are always doing weird things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They eat a vast array of things.</v>

2882
02:16:17.950 --> 02:16:21.250
<v Speaker 2>My friend John Dudley was watching a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bear through his binoculars and he saw a</v>

2883
02:16:21.251 --> 02:16:25.030
<v Speaker 2>bear run up on a Moose and smash it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back and crush it.</v>

2884
02:16:25.450 --> 02:16:30.100
<v Speaker 2>That's what I talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He saw grizzly smash a on the back and</v>

2885
02:16:30.101 --> 02:16:33.760
<v Speaker 2>break its back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally hit it so hard that it snapped</v>

2886
02:16:33.761 --> 02:16:36.820
<v Speaker 2>the Moose is back and then he tackled it</v>
<v Speaker 2>once it was down,</v>

2887
02:16:36.821 --> 02:16:38.110
<v Speaker 2>started eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen that,</v>

2888
02:16:38.111 --> 02:16:42.190
<v Speaker 2>but that's what I'm looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you watch them and there's this sort</v>

2889
02:16:42.191 --> 02:16:44.470
<v Speaker 2>of anticipation was seeing them right.</v>

2890
02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:49.400
<v Speaker 2>Deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very interesting and the more</v>

2891
02:16:49.401 --> 02:16:50.930
<v Speaker 2>you wash them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you learn about them.</v>

2892
02:16:50.931 --> 02:16:54.320
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that I've always been</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinated by and was talking about with</v>

2893
02:16:54.321 --> 02:16:56.310
<v Speaker 2>some friends of mine recently was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2894
02:16:56.910 --> 02:17:01.910
<v Speaker 2>how interested I become an interpersonal</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship is among mule deer,</v>

2895
02:17:01.971 --> 02:17:06.971
<v Speaker 2>like the body language they use and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can locate deer that you can't see</v>

2896
02:17:08.660 --> 02:17:13.660
<v Speaker 2>just based on body language of deer that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that you watch them and you</v>

2897
02:17:14.301 --> 02:17:19.301
<v Speaker 2>become aware of things that are aware of</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you learn where other things are</v>

2898
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:22.100
<v Speaker 2>that are out of your view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just by how,</v>

2899
02:17:22.850 --> 02:17:25.190
<v Speaker 2>just by what it's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both male and female.</v>

2900
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Generally it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's doe,</v>

2901
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:32.910
<v Speaker 2>not sometimes in a general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most obvious one is dosed that no,</v>

2902
02:17:33.351 --> 02:17:36.770
<v Speaker 2>there's a buck around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You took me for body language there and</v>

2903
02:17:36.771 --> 02:17:40.670
<v Speaker 2>then doles that are encountering another</v>
<v Speaker 2>band of Doe's have a body language they</v>

2904
02:17:40.671 --> 02:17:44.470
<v Speaker 2>use and you just get used to this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sort of a base.</v>

2905
02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then once you see it you go like,</v>

2906
02:17:46.130 --> 02:17:47.880
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows about it.</v>

2907
02:17:47.930 --> 02:17:52.070
<v Speaker 2>There's a deer somewhere that's not net</v>
<v Speaker 2>group and that deer is aware of the fact</v>

2908
02:17:52.071 --> 02:17:55.940
<v Speaker 2>that the deer is not in the group and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like wondering about it and you</v>

2909
02:17:55.941 --> 02:17:57.770
<v Speaker 2>just see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm interested that kind of stuff.</v>

2910
02:17:57.980 --> 02:17:59.630
<v Speaker 2>But I could walk away from deere.</v>

2911
02:18:01.030 --> 02:18:02.650
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see there's some deer and I can</v>

2912
02:18:02.651 --> 02:18:05.560
<v Speaker 2>just go look in another direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something about me makes me stare at</v>

2913
02:18:05.561 --> 02:18:06.910
<v Speaker 2>bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2914
02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:09.010
<v Speaker 2>I can't give up on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just like I'm watching them,</v>

2915
02:18:09.011 --> 02:18:09.844
<v Speaker 2>watching them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching them.</v>

2916
02:18:10.180 --> 02:18:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Do you have the same feeling about</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolverines?</v>

2917
02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Does the first bull run over?</v>
<v Speaker 2>See my whole life.</v>

2918
02:18:14.621 --> 02:18:16.510
<v Speaker 2>That was the one that was the thing on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my checklist.</v>

2919
02:18:16.570 --> 02:18:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Like as far as like if you large land</v>
<v Speaker 2>mammals.</v>

2920
02:18:20.590 --> 02:18:23.350
<v Speaker 2>That was the one I was missing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'd never seen one?</v>

2921
02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:23.921
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2922
02:18:23.921 --> 02:18:25.840
<v Speaker 2>large like American land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mammals.</v>

2923
02:18:25.841 --> 02:18:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was me.</v>

2924
02:18:26.650 --> 02:18:29.770
<v Speaker 2>That was the one missing from my list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you'd feel a feeling of</v>

2925
02:18:29.771 --> 02:18:32.890
<v Speaker 2>remorse if you shot the one that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only one you saw.</v>

2926
02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:36.160
<v Speaker 2>That's why I said I wasn't going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>touch that screen because of that.</v>

2927
02:18:36.490 --> 02:18:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I even said right then in there I said</v>

2928
02:18:38.141 --> 02:18:40.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to shoot the first one is</v>
<v Speaker 2>something I saw.</v>

2929
02:18:40.590 --> 02:18:43.460
<v Speaker 2>That's how I feel like when I was saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier about the black hole of Africa,</v>

2930
02:18:43.461 --> 02:18:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I always imagined that guy's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa and being like,</v>

2931
02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:47.950
<v Speaker 2>no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what one of those shoes look</v>

2932
02:18:48.010 --> 02:18:51.890
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's right.</v>

2933
02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:53.000
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2934
02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:55.450
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't built up a context about it.</v>

2935
02:18:55.451 --> 02:18:58.330
<v Speaker 2>So then we're like talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you see another one,</v>

2936
02:18:58.530 --> 02:18:59.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>

2937
02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:00.460
<v Speaker 2>I'd reconsider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

2938
02:19:00.461 --> 02:19:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to shoot the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolverine I ever laid eyes on.</v>

2939
02:19:02.531 --> 02:19:04.210
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was trying to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2940
02:19:04.211 --> 02:19:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Yannis has seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2941
02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:08.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been out Caribou hunting and watch</v>

2942
02:19:08.951 --> 02:19:10.990
<v Speaker 2>wolverine scavenge and Caribou</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carcasses.</v>

2943
02:19:11.530 --> 02:19:12.341
<v Speaker 2>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2944
02:19:12.341 --> 02:19:16.570
<v Speaker 2>he's not the first one you saw and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just dilly dallied no one so he could</v>

2945
02:19:16.571 --> 02:19:18.370
<v Speaker 2>have shot it because it wasn't the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>one he saw,</v>

2946
02:19:19.570 --> 02:19:22.120
<v Speaker 2>but no one was feeling any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just one of those things.</v>

2947
02:19:22.121 --> 02:19:23.420
<v Speaker 2>No one was feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt,</v>

2948
02:19:23.470 --> 02:19:24.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

2949
02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:26.020
<v Speaker 2>Assuming I remember watching my youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

2950
02:19:26.021 --> 02:19:27.980
<v Speaker 2>a white tail deer looks you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember watching the</v>

2951
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:31.040
<v Speaker 5>first links I ever saw and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel that,</v>

2952
02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:33.200
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2953
02:19:33.380 --> 02:19:37.010
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anthropomorphizing a fair bit here,</v>

2954
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:42.190
<v Speaker 5>but he was the first links that I ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>saw and I just had a strong feeling that</v>

2955
02:19:42.981 --> 02:19:47.160
<v Speaker 5>I was the first person he ever saw</v>
<v Speaker 5>a look of.</v>

2956
02:19:47.170 --> 02:19:51.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>a look of like sheer,</v>

2957
02:19:51.321 --> 02:19:53.330
<v Speaker 5>like uncomprehensive for what he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>seeing.</v>

2958
02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:56.510
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

2959
02:19:57.020 --> 02:19:58.580
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is this good,</v>

2960
02:19:58.840 --> 02:20:01.700
<v Speaker 5>bad?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does this mean?</v>

2961
02:20:02.220 --> 02:20:05.720
<v Speaker 5>And you see what kind of run through all</v>
<v Speaker 5>these calculations in his mind and just</v>

2962
02:20:05.721 --> 02:20:07.740
<v Speaker 5>drift off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like after awhile I,</v>

2963
02:20:07.741 --> 02:20:08.690
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>

2964
02:20:09.650 --> 02:20:12.950
<v Speaker 5>something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This thing has got its eyes,</v>

2965
02:20:13.170 --> 02:20:17.990
<v Speaker 5>him looking at me like his eyes are</v>
<v Speaker 5>centered on his face,</v>

2966
02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:23.750
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a Predator maybe for someone tells</v>

2967
02:20:23.751 --> 02:20:26.000
<v Speaker 5>me something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2968
02:20:26.090 --> 02:20:28.940
<v Speaker 5>he's looking at me very intently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not trying to act like I'm not</v>

2969
02:20:28.941 --> 02:20:31.070
<v Speaker 5>there and therefore he can't see me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2970
02:20:31.570 --> 02:20:33.950
<v Speaker 5>and you just see them kind of run it</v>
<v Speaker 5>through his head and just be like,</v>

2971
02:20:34.360 --> 02:20:34.970
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2972
02:20:34.970 --> 02:20:36.380
<v Speaker 5>because nothing good's going to come</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

2973
02:20:37.570 --> 02:20:40.370
<v Speaker 5>I didn't go off the road direction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but just based on where I was.</v>

2974
02:20:40.371 --> 02:20:41.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was very safe to say he'd</v>

2975
02:20:41.691 --> 02:20:43.990
<v Speaker 5>never run into a person and I'd never</v>
<v Speaker 5>run into a length.</v>

2976
02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:47.300
<v Speaker 5>We just had this moment of um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2977
02:20:47.301 --> 02:20:48.260
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I carry a,</v>

2978
02:20:48.261 --> 02:20:48.630
<v Speaker 5>an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

2979
02:20:48.630 --> 02:20:52.610
<v Speaker 5>a cultural awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I at least knew about what I was</v>

2980
02:20:52.611 --> 02:20:56.480
<v Speaker 5>looking at but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was in this point of I'm just,</v>

2981
02:20:56.510 --> 02:21:01.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>processing and like the white tail that</v>

2982
02:21:01.191 --> 02:21:03.830
<v Speaker 5>you encountered who damn sure knew what</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2983
02:21:03.860 --> 02:21:05.510
<v Speaker 5>that thing carries with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2984
02:21:05.511 --> 02:21:07.490
<v Speaker 5>We talked about it before the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 5>started,</v>

2985
02:21:07.491 --> 02:21:08.324
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2986
02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:11.660
<v Speaker 5>I was hunting with my friend John Dudley</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we were in the tree stand and we</v>

2987
02:21:11.661 --> 02:21:14.930
<v Speaker 5>were supposed to get down at 1:30 and at</v>
<v Speaker 5>1:25.</v>

2988
02:21:14.931 --> 02:21:16.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you want you want to call it and</v>

2989
02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:17.390
<v Speaker 5>then eat lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

2990
02:21:17.391 --> 02:21:20.360
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I climbed down first and that 1:25</v>

2991
02:21:20.361 --> 02:21:24.310
<v Speaker 5>like five fucking minutes before we set</v>
<v Speaker 5>it and this big mature whitetail walks</v>

2992
02:21:24.311 --> 02:21:28.160
<v Speaker 5>through and John Signals to me does the</v>
<v Speaker 5>bowl winkle thing,</v>

2993
02:21:28.161 --> 02:21:32.030
<v Speaker 5>but putting his thumbs on his head and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he starts pointing and then I realized</v>

2994
02:21:32.031 --> 02:21:36.770
<v Speaker 5>as a deer coming down the path and so I</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of hide behind the tree,</v>

2995
02:21:36.771 --> 02:21:38.510
<v Speaker 5>but there was all these branches in</v>
<v Speaker 5>front of me.</v>

2996
02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:40.280
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've already heard the story,</v>

2997
02:21:40.281 --> 02:21:43.130
<v Speaker 5>but for the people listening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that deer locked eyes with me and there</v>

2998
02:21:43.131 --> 02:21:46.400
<v Speaker 5>was this intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like immediate intensity in his eyes</v>

2999
02:21:46.580 --> 02:21:49.910
<v Speaker 5>that had never experienced an animal</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at me like it was.</v>

3000
02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:54.020
<v Speaker 5>It was very tuned in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knew exactly that I shouldn't be</v>

3001
02:21:54.021 --> 02:21:56.210
<v Speaker 5>there and I just froze.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was wearing Camo.</v>

3002
02:21:56.330 --> 02:21:58.990
<v Speaker 5>He's looking me right in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like right in.</v>

3003
02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.910
<v Speaker 5>His eyes were bulging out of his head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I turned around and bolted,</v>

3004
02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:07.600
<v Speaker 5>but it's like electricity to them like</v>
<v Speaker 5>they know I have very vivid memories of</v>

3005
02:22:08.060 --> 02:22:13.060
<v Speaker 5>when I was 12 and had just hit legal</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunting age and Michigan and I was</v>

3006
02:22:14.331 --> 02:22:19.331
<v Speaker 5>sitting on the ground hunting squirrels</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a farm owned by a man named,</v>

3007
02:22:20.260 --> 02:22:22.730
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there a lot and</v>

3008
02:22:24.380 --> 02:22:26.190
<v Speaker 5>leaning against a tree and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and having,</v>

3009
02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:26.881
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3010
02:22:26.881 --> 02:22:31.881
<v Speaker 3>for corn white tail coming through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>woods and you know,</v>

3011
02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:34.710
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a buck like that.</v>

3012
02:22:34.740 --> 02:22:36.930
<v Speaker 3>This isn't always true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Gianluca for chrome white tells a</v>

3013
02:22:36.931 --> 02:22:39.450
<v Speaker 3>year and a half old the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even at that time,</v>

3014
02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:41.730
<v Speaker 3>you start hunt squirrels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>September 15 and Michigan.</v>

3015
02:22:42.140 --> 02:22:42.510
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3016
02:22:42.510 --> 02:22:44.370
<v Speaker 3>that deere was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3017
02:22:44.490 --> 02:22:48.090
<v Speaker 3>he could have been as little as 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>16 months old.</v>

3018
02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:55.280
<v Speaker 3>He locked on to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw me and knew to look in my eyes but</v>

3019
02:22:58.621 --> 02:23:01.530
<v Speaker 3>didn't know what the Hell I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember him coming at me and coming</v>

3020
02:23:01.531 --> 02:23:06.060
<v Speaker 3>at me and coming at me and getting so</v>
<v Speaker 3>scared and I and I had always known</v>

3021
02:23:06.061 --> 02:23:07.410
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just like there's a thing you just</v>

3022
02:23:07.411 --> 02:23:09.170
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't yell in the woods like you</v>

3023
02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:11.850
<v Speaker 3>don't make noise in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd try to be quiet.</v>

3024
02:23:11.851 --> 02:23:14.940
<v Speaker 3>And it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember grabbing sticks and trying to</v>

3025
02:23:14.941 --> 02:23:19.200
<v Speaker 3>snap them to make a noise to make that</v>
<v Speaker 3>deer spook off,</v>

3026
02:23:19.201 --> 02:23:22.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but being like conflicted between just</v>

3027
02:23:22.321 --> 02:23:25.830
<v Speaker 3>being scared shitless and doing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing you don't do like as a hunter is</v>

3028
02:23:25.831 --> 02:23:28.640
<v Speaker 3>you just learn like don't make loud</v>
<v Speaker 3>noises in the woods when people made</v>

3029
02:23:28.650 --> 02:23:29.190
<v Speaker 3>loud noises.</v>

3030
02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:29.480
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3031
02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:30.700
<v Speaker 1>It makes me cringe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3032
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting about this mature</v>

3033
02:23:32.441 --> 02:23:37.030
<v Speaker 1>deer that saw me and freaked out when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw me is that literally a minute before</v>

3034
02:23:37.031 --> 02:23:39.220
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was down when I was down,</v>

3035
02:23:39.250 --> 02:23:43.810
<v Speaker 1>that deer came through with two other</v>
<v Speaker 1>deer and one of 'em look to be like</v>

3036
02:23:43.811 --> 02:23:46.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe a two year old deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of them was baby.</v>

3037
02:23:46.330 --> 02:23:49.720
<v Speaker 1>One of them was like one year old and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one year old got within 15 feet of</v>

3038
02:23:49.721 --> 02:23:50.410
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3039
02:23:50.410 --> 02:23:53.150
<v Speaker 1>I just pinned up against the tree and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one year old walked right by me,</v>

3040
02:23:53.170 --> 02:23:56.530
<v Speaker 1>had no idea it was alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other one that was younger deer</v>

3041
02:23:57.190 --> 02:23:59.320
<v Speaker 1>walked by me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't look my direction at all.</v>

3042
02:23:59.350 --> 02:24:01.510
<v Speaker 1>The old one looked right at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3043
02:24:01.511 --> 02:24:05.560
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew right away he'd seen people</v>

3044
02:24:05.561 --> 02:24:08.830
<v Speaker 1>before maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're in Iowa and I was really</v>

3045
02:24:08.831 --> 02:24:12.430
<v Speaker 1>different because I always a great state</v>
<v Speaker 1>for bow hunting because they have a very</v>

3046
02:24:12.431 --> 02:24:14.260
<v Speaker 1>short gun season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only shotgun.</v>

3047
02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:15.351
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3048
02:24:15.351 --> 02:24:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get a big rifle heart.</v>

3049
02:24:17.351 --> 02:24:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of what they're dealing with is</v>

3050
02:24:19.490 --> 02:24:21.430
<v Speaker 1>a bowhunters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He.</v>

3051
02:24:21.431 --> 02:24:23.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might've known that I had a bow.</v>

3052
02:24:23.230 --> 02:24:24.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows?</v>

3053
02:24:24.470 --> 02:24:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Saw a bow and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that fucking thing before.</v>

3054
02:24:26.980 --> 02:24:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Somebody shot me in the ass with one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those a year ago.</v>

3055
02:24:29.590 --> 02:24:30.650
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things I like that egg</v>

3056
02:24:30.670 --> 02:24:31.700
<v Speaker 3>about big bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3057
02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:35.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that culturally in this country</v>

3058
02:24:35.421 --> 02:24:38.540
<v Speaker 3>we're kind of getting where it's almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this thick accepted idea that</v>

3059
02:24:38.541 --> 02:24:40.460
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to hate trophy hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3060
02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:45.760
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat everything I kill and I will even</v>

3061
02:24:46.401 --> 02:24:49.160
<v Speaker 3>talk about there's like meat box and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooter box,</v>

3062
02:24:49.161 --> 02:24:50.600
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And meaning like there's like big huge</v>

3063
02:24:50.601 --> 02:24:54.200
<v Speaker 3>box that are cool and meat box they eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I always eat my shooter box.</v>

3064
02:24:54.740 --> 02:24:55.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3065
02:24:55.460 --> 02:24:57.200
<v Speaker 3>like shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big buck is elite one.</v>

3066
02:24:57.201 --> 02:24:57.951
<v Speaker 3>It's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two,</v>

3067
02:24:57.951 --> 02:25:00.410
<v Speaker 3>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can Pepsi challenge them.</v>

3068

<v Speaker 3>Pepsi challenge of five-year-old deer</v>

3069
02:25:02.670 --> 02:25:04.400
<v Speaker 3>and in a two year old deer and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't.</v>

3070
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:06.740
<v Speaker 3>Well you can because you're really good</v>
<v Speaker 3>at cooking.</v>

3071
02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:07.941
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm saying it's good.</v>

3072
02:25:07.941 --> 02:25:09.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know how to cut it and trim it</v>

3073
02:25:09.621 --> 02:25:10.670
<v Speaker 3>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're great.</v>

<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

3076
02:25:17.790 --> 02:25:18.650
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>small one or go after one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to go after the big one.</v>

3079
02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:27.580
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I like about going</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the big one and the challenge of</v>

3080
02:25:27.581 --> 02:25:32.581
<v Speaker 3>it is that they are harder to get and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason they're harder to get it</v>

3081
02:25:32.980 --> 02:25:36.760
<v Speaker 3>because they have learned from mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3082
02:25:37.690 --> 02:25:38.760
<v Speaker 3>a big buck to,</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3084
02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:40.090
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3085
02:25:40.090 --> 02:25:42.670
<v Speaker 3>experienced hunter when he sees a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>buck.</v>

3086
02:25:43.060 --> 02:25:46.750
<v Speaker 3>He sees more than the antlers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the antlers one up kind of becoming like</v>

3087
02:25:46.751 --> 02:25:51.751
<v Speaker 3>symbolic of something of a very worthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenging cory because he hasn't made</v>

3088
02:25:52.781 --> 02:25:54.460
<v Speaker 3>any mistakes yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3089
02:25:54.910 --> 02:25:59.060
<v Speaker 3>You can have big box in areas that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>very low predation and low hunter</v>

3090
02:25:59.061 --> 02:26:03.670
<v Speaker 3>pressure and he could get big and still</v>
<v Speaker 3>make some mistakes because he doesn't</v>

3091
02:26:03.671 --> 02:26:06.220
<v Speaker 3>have as many mistakes that could be</v>
<v Speaker 3>made.</v>

3092
02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:10.770
<v Speaker 3>But a really big buck and an area that</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a lot of lines,</v>

3093
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:12.820
<v Speaker 3>a lot of coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves,</v>

3094
02:26:13.480 --> 02:26:15.150
<v Speaker 3>human hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3095
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:17.470
<v Speaker 3>he's big because he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't messed up,</v>

3096
02:26:17.500 --> 02:26:19.600
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't fuck up.</v>

3097
02:26:20.290 --> 02:26:22.000
<v Speaker 3>He remembers stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3098
02:26:22.270 --> 02:26:26.140
<v Speaker 3>we had a occasion to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're hunting in Colorado hunt mule deer</v>

3099
02:26:26.141 --> 02:26:28.810
<v Speaker 3>this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we watched,</v>

3100
02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:31.570
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I glanced up at pretty nice buck and</v>

3101
02:26:31.571 --> 02:26:35.830
<v Speaker 3>they went up and do an aspen grove.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was traveling with a bunch of dose</v>

3102
02:26:35.890 --> 02:26:38.710
<v Speaker 3>and they all go into an aspen grove</v>
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>

3103
02:26:38.711 --> 02:26:41.050
<v Speaker 3>Yannis was looking above there and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

3104
02:26:41.051 --> 02:26:45.430
<v Speaker 3>there's some coyotes rolling down into</v>
<v Speaker 3>that aspen grove where all the deer,</v>

3105
02:26:45.431 --> 02:26:49.180
<v Speaker 3>when it's now the middle of the day and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's rifle season,</v>

3106
02:26:49.181 --> 02:26:52.210
<v Speaker 3>has been rifle season on and off through</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of weeks of hunting season,</v>

3107
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:57.910
<v Speaker 3>the coyotes go into the Aspen Grove.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those deer component out of that</v>

3108
02:26:57.911 --> 02:26:58.480
<v Speaker 3>Aspen Grove.</v>

3109
02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:01.420
<v Speaker 3>I at the time comment on how it seemed</v>
<v Speaker 3>like someone like squeezing a tube of</v>

3110
02:27:01.421 --> 02:27:03.940
<v Speaker 3>toothpaste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way the deer came shooting out of</v>

3111
02:27:03.941 --> 02:27:08.941
<v Speaker 3>that Aspen Grove and ran out across a</v>
<v Speaker 3>large sage flat exposing themselves.</v>

3112
02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:14.740
<v Speaker 3>The one deer out of the group that</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't walk out of that stage,</v>

3113
02:27:14.980 --> 02:27:16.960
<v Speaker 3>that didn't walk out of that Aspen Grove</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the big buck.</v>

3114
02:27:18.010 --> 02:27:23.010
<v Speaker 3>Never budged because he ran a</v>
<v Speaker 3>calculation in his head where he's like,</v>

3115
02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:28.420
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Y'all scared of those coyotes.</v>

3116
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:32.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would rather stay in here and my</v>

3117
02:27:32.171 --> 02:27:35.170
<v Speaker 3>little thicket and he stood up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could see him stand up in there,</v>

3118
02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:38.590
<v Speaker 3>that son of a bitch would not move and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's during the Rut.</v>

3119
02:27:38.591 --> 02:27:42.280
<v Speaker 3>So every thing in his body is saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>chase those donors and breed those dogs.</v>

3120
02:27:42.281 --> 02:27:44.290
<v Speaker 3>That's all he's thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His breeding dose.</v>

3121
02:27:45.100 --> 02:27:47.470
<v Speaker 3>A dumb Bach would have chased those.</v>

3122
02:27:47.470 --> 02:27:51.220
<v Speaker 3>Those if not for fear of the coyote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would've chased the dose just because</v>

3123
02:27:51.250 --> 02:27:53.050
<v Speaker 3>for fear of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another buck is going to go breed them.</v>

3124
02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:56.490
<v Speaker 3>But he resisted that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3125
02:27:56.980 --> 02:27:59.710
<v Speaker 3>He resisted the fear of the coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's like,</v>

3126
02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:03.940
<v Speaker 3>I know that there is trouble when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>run out in the open</v>

3127
02:28:05.780 --> 02:28:07.810
<v Speaker 3>shit shoots at you or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knew.</v>

3128
02:28:08.410 --> 02:28:10.090
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just sweated it out,</v>

3129
02:28:11.890 --> 02:28:13.600
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3130
02:28:13.601 --> 02:28:16.960
<v Speaker 3>So it's like he didn't like and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>lived.</v>

3131
02:28:17.860 --> 02:28:19.050
<v Speaker 3>He didn't mess up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3132
02:28:19.060 --> 02:28:22.340
<v Speaker 3>a big book like that is also kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>threatening to a coyote to.</v>

3133
02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:23.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that's part of it.</v>

3134
02:28:23.780 --> 02:28:24.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

3135
02:28:24.621 --> 02:28:26.570
<v Speaker 3>As part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just like he,</v>

3136
02:28:26.610 --> 02:28:31.010
<v Speaker 3>there's a threat in instinctively or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever because here's the thing that</v>

3137
02:28:31.011 --> 02:28:33.410
<v Speaker 3>they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were not interested in those deer.</v>

3138
02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:36.230
<v Speaker 3>They weren't chasing him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they know because they see they</v>

3139
02:28:36.231 --> 02:28:38.350
<v Speaker 3>lose Fonz to them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3140
02:28:38.390 --> 02:28:40.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean they see stuff die from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>

3141
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:41.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now there's a couple of.</v>

3142
02:28:41.991 --> 02:28:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Kyle's is at that time of year isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to drag down a healthy fire.</v>

3143
02:28:45.891 --> 02:28:47.090
<v Speaker 3>Mueller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't even chasing him,</v>

3144
02:28:47.450 --> 02:28:48.500
<v Speaker 3>but he just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knew,</v>

3145
02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:50.450
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3146
02:28:50.780 --> 02:28:53.810
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the things I admire</v>
<v Speaker 3>about like the old ones,</v>

3147
02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:56.540
<v Speaker 3>if you can consider,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can go into areas that have heavy</v>

3148
02:28:56.541 --> 02:28:59.060
<v Speaker 3>hunting pressure and consistently find</v>
<v Speaker 3>those deer,</v>

3149
02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:00.170
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3150
02:29:00.170 --> 02:29:03.710
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the highest challenge.</v>

3151
02:29:03.770 --> 02:29:04.603
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3152
02:29:04.820 --> 02:29:06.950
<v Speaker 3>I respect it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I respect it.</v>

3153
02:29:07.070 --> 02:29:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very difficult quarry and when</v>

3154
02:29:09.231 --> 02:29:11.350
<v Speaker 1>you're eating that animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

3155
02:29:11.390 --> 02:29:13.820
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a completely different sense of</v>

3156
02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:16.430
<v Speaker 1>not just accomplishment but connection</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that animal.</v>

3157
02:29:16.431 --> 02:29:21.431
<v Speaker 1>Then buying some stake in a store or</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting some button buck.</v>

3158
02:29:21.770 --> 02:29:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a.</v>

3159
02:29:25.380 --> 02:29:28.730
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing that winds up being</v>
<v Speaker 3>like such an obvious conversation that</v>

3160
02:29:28.731 --> 02:29:33.731
<v Speaker 3>it's that you sometimes feel like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done having that conversation with</v>

3161
02:29:33.861 --> 02:29:35.870
<v Speaker 3>people who don't get is like shooting</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish in a barrel.</v>

3162
02:29:36.090 --> 02:29:38.540
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like so obvious and so easy that</v>

3163
02:29:38.570 --> 02:29:43.280
<v Speaker 3>you almost feel like a little bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like almost unfair to bring it up.</v>

3164
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:45.620
<v Speaker 3>Will you say that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3165
02:29:45.621 --> 02:29:49.700
<v Speaker 3>Why do something like pro for the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>reason why you challenged to chase after</v>

3166
02:29:49.701 --> 02:29:54.020
<v Speaker 3>big bucks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're telling me that somehow you</v>

3167
02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:58.550
<v Speaker 3>like if you eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that somehow the system by which you go</v>

3168
02:29:58.551 --> 02:30:03.551
<v Speaker 3>about getting meat to farms and stores</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Shit like that is somehow morally or</v>

3169
02:30:05.390 --> 02:30:10.390
<v Speaker 3>aesthetically or or ethically are</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow superior to me eating an animal</v>

3170
02:30:12.170 --> 02:30:16.130
<v Speaker 3>that I've hunted myself from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainable population as well managed</v>

3171
02:30:16.340 --> 02:30:21.340
<v Speaker 3>and that I've decorated my home with</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's parts that will be there until I</v>

3172
02:30:23.031 --> 02:30:26.720
<v Speaker 3>die and then we'll decorate the homes of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my children.</v>

3173
02:30:27.140 --> 02:30:29.930
<v Speaker 3>If you're telling me somehow that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>like depraved</v>

3174
02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:34.220
<v Speaker 3>for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a hard time engaging in the</v>

3175
02:30:34.221 --> 02:30:37.220
<v Speaker 3>conversation because I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't understand it well with</v>

3176
02:30:37.221 --> 02:30:38.000
<v Speaker 3>other mediators years.</v>

3177
02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:42.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a ridiculous conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very short sided conversation and</v>

3178
02:30:42.051 --> 02:30:45.080
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the problem is that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have so many things going on in their</v>

3179
02:30:45.081 --> 02:30:48.590
<v Speaker 1>lives there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a job and you have a family</v>

3180
02:30:48.591 --> 02:30:51.830
<v Speaker 1>and you have some sort of hobby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've eliminated 90 percent of your</v>

3181
02:30:51.831 --> 02:30:54.110
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much time do you have to actually</v>

3182
02:30:54.111 --> 02:30:56.960
<v Speaker 1>immerse yourself in wildlife and</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the politics of it,</v>

3183
02:30:56.961 --> 02:30:59.540
<v Speaker 1>understand what's really going on out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there in the world.</v>

3184
02:30:59.840 --> 02:31:04.520
<v Speaker 1>How many people have actually seen an</v>
<v Speaker 1>overhead view of the Pacific northwest</v>

3185
02:31:04.521 --> 02:31:09.521
<v Speaker 1>and looked down at all the forest and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just done the calculations in their head</v>

3186
02:31:10.101 --> 02:31:14.360
<v Speaker 1>about these animals and how many of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are and how much of the wild west</v>

3187
02:31:14.361 --> 02:31:18.350
<v Speaker 1>is filled with animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't stop people from having</v>

3188
02:31:18.351 --> 02:31:19.640
<v Speaker 1>opinions of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

3189
02:31:19.650 --> 02:31:20.160
<v Speaker 1>does it.</v>

3190
02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:22.260
<v Speaker 3>They're just not educated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the reason why.</v>

3191
02:31:22.350 --> 02:31:23.183
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3192
02:31:23.370 --> 02:31:28.370
<v Speaker 3>is the reason why after all these years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still have no opinion on obamacare</v>

3193
02:31:29.220 --> 02:31:32.700
<v Speaker 3>because I do not understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll point out like I have no opinion</v>

3194
02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:36.060
<v Speaker 3>now trying to have this infectious</v>
<v Speaker 3>result on people where people will stop</v>

3195
02:31:36.061 --> 02:31:37.960
<v Speaker 3>talking about shit they don't fully</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

3196
02:31:38.190 --> 02:31:40.620
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have these knee jerk opinions.</v>

3197
02:31:40.650 --> 02:31:43.440
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lock them in like this is as a left</v>

3198
02:31:43.441 --> 02:31:45.870
<v Speaker 1>wing person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a right wing person.</v>

3199
02:31:45.871 --> 02:31:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think as we pointed out,</v>

3200
02:31:47.881 --> 02:31:48.670
<v Speaker 1>you and I both,</v>

3201
02:31:48.670 --> 02:31:51.580
<v Speaker 3>I believe that that's a ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

3202
02:31:51.670 --> 02:31:54.300
<v Speaker 3>Can I close a bit of flattery please?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3203
02:31:55.700 --> 02:31:57.310
<v Speaker 3>it didn't occur to me til I was coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>down here today,</v>

3204
02:31:57.520 --> 02:32:01.330
<v Speaker 3>but I've been railing a lot on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3205
02:32:01.960 --> 02:32:02.550
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3206
02:32:02.550 --> 02:32:06.800
<v Speaker 3>the echo chamber that we all live in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3207
02:32:06.910 --> 02:32:09.330
<v Speaker 3>and I think if anyone goes and you look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at your,</v>

3208
02:32:10.900 --> 02:32:14.650
<v Speaker 3>you look at your facebook feed or any</v>
<v Speaker 3>number of things like we surround</v>

3209
02:32:14.651 --> 02:32:18.460
<v Speaker 3>ourselves with people who tell us what</v>
<v Speaker 3>we think,</v>

3210
02:32:18.940 --> 02:32:20.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's kind of become very obvious and</v>

3211
02:32:20.950 --> 02:32:24.820
<v Speaker 3>I think that this presidential election</v>
<v Speaker 3>cycle really brought it out where you</v>

3212
02:32:24.821 --> 02:32:29.821
<v Speaker 3>had just two vastly different narratives</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing out and people on each side of</v>

3213
02:32:30.881 --> 02:32:33.940
<v Speaker 3>it feeling like so absolutely certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>that not only were they right,</v>

3214
02:32:33.941 --> 02:32:37.250
<v Speaker 3>but everyone felt the way they felt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3215
02:32:37.580 --> 02:32:39.340
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just been a big part of the</v>

3216
02:32:39.341 --> 02:32:41.320
<v Speaker 3>national conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the echo chamber thing.</v>

3217
02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I have found with people that</v>

3218
02:32:45.611 --> 02:32:47.770
<v Speaker 3>listen to your show who come up to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and be like,</v>

3219
02:32:47.771 --> 02:32:49.000
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard you on Joe show.</v>

3220
02:32:49.020 --> 02:32:51.310
<v Speaker 3>The Times I've been on there is that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't,</v>

3221
02:32:51.880 --> 02:32:56.880
<v Speaker 3>you've somehow managed to defy that</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have the,</v>

3222
02:33:00.020 --> 02:33:04.910
<v Speaker 3>the right wing nut jobs and the left</v>
<v Speaker 3>wing nut jobs all listening to at the</v>

3223
02:33:04.911 --> 02:33:08.670
<v Speaker 3>same time</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the middle of the rotors.</v>

3224
02:33:09.860 --> 02:33:12.930
<v Speaker 3>But like when someone calls up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to Joe Rogan podcast,</v>

3225
02:33:13.250 --> 02:33:15.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm always thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3226
02:33:15.620 --> 02:33:18.890
<v Speaker 3>what does that make you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean anything.</v>

3227
02:33:21.040 --> 02:33:21.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3228
02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:23.980
<v Speaker 3>just the fact that you listened to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what.</v>

3229
02:33:24.220 --> 02:33:28.480
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't tell me anything about you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other than that you'd like to wrestle</v>

3230
02:33:28.481 --> 02:33:32.500
<v Speaker 3>with ideas because this is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>few places where people are talking</v>

3231
02:33:32.501 --> 02:33:36.190
<v Speaker 3>about shit and you talk about stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring it up where it's like people are</v>

3232
02:33:36.490 --> 02:33:38.770
<v Speaker 3>willing because of you in the way you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>handling it.</v>

3233
02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:43.330
<v Speaker 3>They're willing to subject themselves to</v>
<v Speaker 3>disparate views for a minute.</v>

3234
02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:47.770
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the formula if you've even thought about</v>

3235
02:33:47.771 --> 02:33:49.540
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a nice invention.</v>

3236
02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just how I look at things.</v>

3237
02:33:51.981 --> 02:33:53.530
<v Speaker 1>I think I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3238
02:33:53.570 --> 02:33:56.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have my rigid lines that I won't</v>

3239
02:33:56.481 --> 02:33:57.314
<v Speaker 1>cross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3240
02:33:57.390 --> 02:34:00.800
<v Speaker 1>where I think something is evil or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something is ethically wrong.</v>

3241
02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:02.870
<v Speaker 1>But I'm willing to entertain ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

3242
02:34:03.350 --> 02:34:06.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm not rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if if someone comes to me and they</v>

3243
02:34:06.741 --> 02:34:09.530
<v Speaker 1>tell me that I'm wrong about something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go really like,</v>

3244
02:34:09.531 --> 02:34:10.550
<v Speaker 1>how am I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how am I wrong?</v>

3245
02:34:10.970 --> 02:34:12.230
<v Speaker 1>If they tell me I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3246
02:34:12.290 --> 02:34:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking wrong.</v>

3247
02:34:13.970 --> 02:34:16.940
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not married to my ideas and I</v>

3248
02:34:17.140 --> 02:34:19.360
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real problem that people have</v>

3249
02:34:19.540 --> 02:34:22.240
<v Speaker 1>where they define themselves by their</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge they,</v>

3250
02:34:22.310 --> 02:34:27.310
<v Speaker 1>they think they're smart or they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think they're valuable because they</v>

3251
02:34:27.521 --> 02:34:29.890
<v Speaker 1>have a certain amount of information in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their head and I think that's crazy</v>

3252
02:34:29.891 --> 02:34:32.740
<v Speaker 1>because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially as you start getting into</v>

3253
02:34:32.770 --> 02:34:36.250
<v Speaker 1>more things or get exploring new</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjects and new topics,</v>

3254
02:34:36.251 --> 02:34:38.650
<v Speaker 1>you realize it is impossible to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

3255
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:42.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for you to define yourself by the</v>

3256
02:34:42.370 --> 02:34:45.190
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that you know or the knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know,</v>

3257
02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:48.880
<v Speaker 1>it seems kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're far better off defining</v>

3258
02:34:48.881 --> 02:34:50.200
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even defining yourself,</v>

3259
02:34:50.201 --> 02:34:55.201
<v Speaker 1>but far better off approaching the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>by searching for the truth,</v>

3260
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:58.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not being connected or married to</v>

3261
02:34:58.541 --> 02:35:02.050
<v Speaker 1>any ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's far too often people get into these</v>

3262
02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:06.670
<v Speaker 1>discussions with people and it becomes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>game of trying to win,</v>

3263
02:35:06.990 --> 02:35:08.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to one up the person with</v>

3264
02:35:08.831 --> 02:35:10.750
<v Speaker 1>information or data and then coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>

3265
02:35:10.810 --> 02:35:12.670
<v Speaker 1>coming off of that with the victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3266
02:35:12.671 --> 02:35:13.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>

3267
02:35:13.330 --> 02:35:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what you're seeing on all</v>

3268
02:35:14.921 --> 02:35:16.090
<v Speaker 1>these news shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3269
02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:18.130
<v Speaker 1>You seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I did during the</v>

3270
02:35:18.131 --> 02:35:20.850
<v Speaker 1>election was while the debates were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in and post debate,</v>

3271
02:35:21.050 --> 02:35:24.760
<v Speaker 1>I would bounce back and forth and spend</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour on Fox News and an hour on cnn</v>

3272
02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:27.160
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the world like?</v>

3273
02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:31.510
<v Speaker 1>This is so baffling because these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are just enforced narratives from</v>

3274
02:35:31.511 --> 02:35:33.710
<v Speaker 1>one side and the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the,</v>

3275
02:35:34.010 --> 02:35:35.920
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country suffers because of that.</v>

3276
02:35:35.921 --> 02:35:39.430
<v Speaker 1>People suffer because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tribal inclination that I think</v>

3277
02:35:39.431 --> 02:35:40.910
<v Speaker 1>we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3278
02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:46.000
<v Speaker 1>to support one side or the other or to</v>
<v Speaker 1>adopt these predetermined patterns of</v>

3279
02:35:46.091 --> 02:35:51.091
<v Speaker 1>behavior are predetermined belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems or the or that it's shameful to</v>

3280
02:35:51.431 --> 02:35:52.840
<v Speaker 1>switch positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3281
02:35:52.841 --> 02:35:56.650
<v Speaker 1>That it's a flip flopper like how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck do you not learn?</v>

3282
02:35:56.651 --> 02:35:57.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3283
02:35:57.460 --> 02:36:01.180
<v Speaker 1>you can't be right all the time and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can have preconceived notions that</v>

3284
02:36:01.181 --> 02:36:03.970
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be incorrect and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to recognize those.</v>

3285
02:36:04.340 --> 02:36:05.173
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3286
02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:08.980
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy like I enjoy talking to you.</v>

3287
02:36:09.210 --> 02:36:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

3288
02:36:12.310 --> 02:36:13.270
<v Speaker 1>It's always fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad.</v>

3289
02:36:13.470 --> 02:36:16.440
<v Speaker 1>We should definitely do this more often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think um,</v>

3290
02:36:16.660 --> 02:36:17.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

3291
02:36:17.561 --> 02:36:19.960
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that perspective that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to,</v>

3292
02:36:19.961 --> 02:36:23.740
<v Speaker 1>that you are willing to say it was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have an opinion on obamacare</v>

3293
02:36:23.800 --> 02:36:25.930
<v Speaker 1>because I really don't know know enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

3294
02:36:26.130 --> 02:36:28.720
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really healthy and really</v>

3295
02:36:28.721 --> 02:36:31.630
<v Speaker 1>important and for some reason really</v>
<v Speaker 1>rare,</v>

3296
02:36:31.690 --> 02:36:33.820
<v Speaker 1>especially with a well read person like</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

3297
02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:35.450
<v Speaker 1>It makes you sound a little bit like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb ass.</v>

3298
02:36:35.970 --> 02:36:38.560
<v Speaker 1>I sound like a dumb ass all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm willing to say it,</v>

3299
02:36:38.590 --> 02:36:39.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3300
02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.120
<v Speaker 1>I would be remiss if we ended this</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast without discussing the revenant</v>

3301
02:36:43.350 --> 02:36:47.050
<v Speaker 1>because you fucking crushed me on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that movie.</v>

3302
02:36:47.051 --> 02:36:49.570
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was bad ass and I found out</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all bullshit.</v>

3303
02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:51.360
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only have a couple minutes.</v>

3304
02:36:51.361 --> 02:36:52.470
<v Speaker 2>I got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to leave,</v>

3305
02:36:52.471 --> 02:36:53.304
<v Speaker 2>but I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3306
02:36:54.120 --> 02:36:57.150
<v Speaker 2>explain everything that was bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the revenue first I want to say,</v>

3307
02:36:57.520 --> 02:36:58.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

3308
02:36:58.610 --> 02:37:03.270
<v Speaker 2>my dear friend and colleague,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mo Fallon loves the revenue.</v>

3309
02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:05.100
<v Speaker 2>I love Mo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was out of town.</v>

3310
02:37:05.110 --> 02:37:05.580
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

3311
02:37:05.580 --> 02:37:06.920
<v Speaker 2>he was hoping to come by and say hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's,</v>

3312
02:37:06.930 --> 02:37:07.890
<v Speaker 2>he's in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in.</v>

3313
02:37:08.130 --> 02:37:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Where is he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in the middle east somewhere.</v>

3314
02:37:11.290 --> 02:37:13.080
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in Oman right now in Jordan.</v>

3315
02:37:13.350 --> 02:37:14.790
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3316
02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:18.620
<v Speaker 2>he loves it because it's cinematography</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the end of the conversation</v>

3317
02:37:18.621 --> 02:37:22.490
<v Speaker 2>for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a cinematographer right now as</v>

3318
02:37:22.491 --> 02:37:24.500
<v Speaker 2>a student of american history and</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who,</v>

3319
02:37:24.501 --> 02:37:28.860
<v Speaker 2>who's favorite era is the mountain man</v>
<v Speaker 2>era,</v>

3320
02:37:29.060 --> 02:37:32.900
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which ran away to define the mountain</v>

3321
02:37:32.901 --> 02:37:36.860
<v Speaker 2>man and rob.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It began kind of like the moment lewis</v>

3322
02:37:36.861 --> 02:37:41.861
<v Speaker 2>and clark made it back to st louis after</v>
<v Speaker 2>their expedition and a man named john</v>

3323
02:37:42.051 --> 02:37:46.850
<v Speaker 2>colter turned around and went back out</v>
<v Speaker 2>west to trap beaver.</v>

3324
02:37:47.450 --> 02:37:52.450
<v Speaker 2>The mountain man era began.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One could argue that day and it ended</v>

3325
02:37:53.550 --> 02:37:57.000
<v Speaker 2>when the last rendezvous was held for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the free trappers,</v>

3326
02:37:57.001 --> 02:37:59.040
<v Speaker 2>which is an 18 forties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very short period of time.</v>

3327
02:38:00.270 --> 02:38:03.540
<v Speaker 2>That's my favorite time period of</v>
<v Speaker 2>american history is the mountain man era</v>

3328
02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:06.270
<v Speaker 2>and it was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3329
02:38:06.410 --> 02:38:09.210
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great escapades and discoveries and</v>

3330
02:38:09.211 --> 02:38:12.330
<v Speaker 2>adventure to the mountain men played out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the arid west,</v>

3331
02:38:13.730 --> 02:38:14.563
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3332
02:38:14.790 --> 02:38:19.790
<v Speaker 2>in the willow lined riparian zones of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the american great plains and into</v>

3333
02:38:20.711 --> 02:38:25.711
<v Speaker 2>Montana and valleys</v>
<v Speaker 2>by taking the most famous story from the</v>

3334
02:38:25.891 --> 02:38:28.700
<v Speaker 2>mountain man era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the mauling by bare of,</v>

3335
02:38:29.350 --> 02:38:32.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how was his name not cold,</v>

3336
02:38:32.820 --> 02:38:35.070
<v Speaker 2>was his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>glass glass.</v>

3337
02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:40.760
<v Speaker 2>By taking that story and setting it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nbc along the edges of the boreal</v>

3338
02:38:42.241 --> 02:38:47.241
<v Speaker 2>forest and a sop and dripping landscape</v>
<v Speaker 2>of conifers,</v>

3339
02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:50.253
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3340
02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:53.850
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just a distortion of,</v>

3341
02:38:53.890 --> 02:38:55.910
<v Speaker 2>of every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like if you were making a movie</v>

3342
02:38:55.911 --> 02:39:00.020
<v Speaker 2>about the people who came when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Washington and franklin and</v>

3343
02:39:00.021 --> 02:39:03.560
<v Speaker 2>everyone came together to drop the</v>
<v Speaker 2>american constitution and you set it</v>

3344
02:39:03.561 --> 02:39:07.390
<v Speaker 2>like in the jungles of Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3345
02:39:08.300 --> 02:39:12.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like instead of philadelphia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just struck me to the core.</v>

3346
02:39:12.530 --> 02:39:16.970
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hugh glass did not have a child.</v>

3347
02:39:17.910 --> 02:39:19.880
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have a son who he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>avenging.</v>

3348
02:39:20.390 --> 02:39:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Hugo asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got mauled by a bear and they left him</v>

3349
02:39:22.791 --> 02:39:26.630
<v Speaker 2>in the protection of jim bridger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very young jim bridger was a teenager</v>

3350
02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:30.560
<v Speaker 2>and another guy and hugh glass through</v>
<v Speaker 2>much struggled,</v>

3351
02:39:30.590 --> 02:39:35.590
<v Speaker 2>crawled his way back to I'm a fort and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he later confronted bridger</v>

3352
02:39:38.670 --> 02:39:39.830
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so you know,</v>

3353
02:39:39.831 --> 02:39:42.120
<v Speaker 2>a body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next time someone leaves you to watch a</v>

3354
02:39:42.121 --> 02:39:45.300
<v Speaker 2>guy died in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't leave them laying around by</v>

3355
02:39:45.301 --> 02:39:46.980
<v Speaker 2>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was all he did.</v>

3356
02:39:48.030 --> 02:39:50.130
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a story of forgiveness.</v>

3357
02:39:50.470 --> 02:39:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now in the movie,</v>

3358
02:39:52.801 --> 02:39:56.460
<v Speaker 2>he does forgive Bridger who cowers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he has to go after the guy that</v>

3359
02:39:56.461 --> 02:39:57.810
<v Speaker 2>killed the son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have.</v>

3360
02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:02.460
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you love the story as it exists,</v>

3361
02:40:03.180 --> 02:40:05.190
<v Speaker 2>to me it's like the bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like if you were going to go</v>

3362
02:40:05.191 --> 02:40:08.400
<v Speaker 2>film a movie about the bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but change real big parts of it.</v>

3363
02:40:08.510 --> 02:40:10.380
<v Speaker 2>He added aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3364
02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Or like it was how people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when</v>

3365
02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:17.220
<v Speaker 3>it was help is probably how people felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>when last temptation of christ came out</v>

3366
02:40:19.050 --> 02:40:20.160
<v Speaker 3>and they had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3367
02:40:20.161 --> 02:40:23.720
<v Speaker 3>the christ figure lusting for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't remember,</v>

3368
02:40:24.030 --> 02:40:25.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were like,</v>

3369
02:40:25.110 --> 02:40:26.190
<v Speaker 3>it was an abomination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3370
02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:29.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for me to like take parts of,</v>

3371
02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:33.570
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a story that demonstrates sort of the</v>

3372
02:40:33.571 --> 02:40:38.571
<v Speaker 3>american landscape and american grit and</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn it into a british colombian,</v>

3373
02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:40.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a canadian farce.</v>

3375
02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:45.600
<v Speaker 3>It just was insulting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3376
02:40:45.601 --> 02:40:48.480
<v Speaker 3>how about the fact that he fell off a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cliff and landed on a tree.</v>

3377
02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:51.180
<v Speaker 3>The lot of that stuff was offsets all</v>
<v Speaker 3>fake.</v>

3378
02:40:51.900 --> 02:40:53.060
<v Speaker 3>None of that happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3379
02:40:53.100 --> 02:40:55.650
<v Speaker 3>He did a lot of crawling and I think he</v>
<v Speaker 3>ate a rattlesnake.</v>

3380
02:40:55.770 --> 02:40:58.410
<v Speaker 3>he did come across.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3385
02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:08.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't know at wHat point he started</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking.</v>

3386
02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.820
<v Speaker 3>He started out crawling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great story.</v>

3387
02:41:12.140 --> 02:41:15.690
<v Speaker 3>I have done damn movie like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have called it the crawling</v>

<v Speaker 3>of struggle,</v>

3390
02:41:22.170 --> 02:41:24.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not likE he makes his own teletype</v>

02:41:24.541 --> 02:41:28.830
<v Speaker 3>machine and start sending messages to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of the world and I could see</v>

3392
02:41:28.831 --> 02:41:29.750
<v Speaker 3>how it went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've,</v>

3393
02:41:29.810 --> 02:41:31.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3394
02:41:31.451 --> 02:41:35.850
<v Speaker 3>where I can see that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are forces at play where they</v>

3395
02:41:35.851 --> 02:41:37.890
<v Speaker 3>probably went in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were saying,</v>

3396
02:41:37.891 --> 02:41:40.200
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get all that shit,</v>

3397
02:41:40.201 --> 02:41:41.870
<v Speaker 3>but you better put a love interest in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

3398
02:41:42.800 --> 02:41:45.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that a lot of ways similar to your</v>

3399
02:41:45.331 --> 02:41:48.000
<v Speaker 3>experiences in hollywood when you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing your first show?</v>

3400
02:41:48.060 --> 02:41:49.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You kNow,</v>

3401
02:41:49.170 --> 02:41:50.003
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3402
02:41:50.310 --> 02:41:52.520
<v Speaker 3>what was it the wild within wild within.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3403
02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:55.440
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I saw your first show and then I</v>

3404
02:41:55.441 --> 02:41:58.470
<v Speaker 3>spoke with you about it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're telling me like they were trying</v>

3405
02:41:58.471 --> 02:42:00.210
<v Speaker 3>to like let him loose loose and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would shoot it.</v>

3406
02:42:00.211 --> 02:42:01.810
<v Speaker 3>They had like a captain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just,</v>

3407
02:42:01.860 --> 02:42:04.750
<v Speaker 3>it was an early cOnversation I had where</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to explain it.</v>

3408
02:42:04.751 --> 02:42:05.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's pretty hard,</v>

3409
02:42:05.851 --> 02:42:07.410
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of times stuff doesn't show</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

3410
02:42:07.411 --> 02:42:10.340
<v Speaker 3>And the guy who I later became friends</v>
<v Speaker 3>with and have a lot of respect for him,</v>

3411
02:42:10.420 --> 02:42:12.390
<v Speaker 3>but he was new to huntington,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was not,</v>

3412
02:42:12.570 --> 02:42:14.280
<v Speaker 3>was not new to television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was new to hunting.</v>

3413
02:42:14.281 --> 02:42:14.791
<v Speaker 3>And he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3414
02:42:14.791 --> 02:42:17.580
<v Speaker 3>that's why they have animal wranglers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's Just one of the,</v>

3415
02:42:17.581 --> 02:42:19.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the early conversations we had,</v>

3416
02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:22.110
<v Speaker 3>I wound up liking quite a bit.</v>

3417
02:42:22.110 --> 02:42:22.861
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

3418
02:42:22.861 --> 02:42:24.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that one of the things that gets</v>

3419
02:42:24.691 --> 02:42:29.250
<v Speaker 3>reality television in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a fake anecdote I often tell</v>

3420
02:42:29.251 --> 02:42:32.190
<v Speaker 3>about about two kinds of producers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3421
02:42:32.250 --> 02:42:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a producer who would say to you,</v>

3422
02:42:35.310 --> 02:42:38.130
<v Speaker 3>how would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever you're doing.</v>

3423
02:42:39.180 --> 02:42:39.811
<v Speaker 3>And you'd Say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3424
02:42:39.811 --> 02:42:44.811
<v Speaker 3>I'd take this really small little knife</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'd very carefully make a really</v>

3425
02:42:46.590 --> 02:42:51.590
<v Speaker 3>delicate little incision right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they would say,</v>

3426
02:42:51.870 --> 02:42:56.010
<v Speaker 3>great film that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there are ones that would go,</v>

3427
02:42:56.070 --> 02:42:58.710
<v Speaker 3>but could you use a machete?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that,</v>

3428
02:42:58.711 --> 02:43:00.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3429
02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:04.620
<v Speaker 3>and those are two types of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3430
02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:09.680
<v Speaker 3>and luckily in my career I've now I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to surround myself with people who,</v>

3431
02:43:11.350 --> 02:43:13.000
<v Speaker 3>who liked that little small knife.</v>

3432
02:43:14.010 --> 02:43:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got very fortunate in that you went</v>

3433
02:43:16.201 --> 02:43:19.500
<v Speaker 1>to the sportsmans channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which gives you essentially free reign.</v>

3434
02:43:19.770 --> 02:43:20.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't mess with us.</v>

3435
02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:21.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

3436
02:43:21.690 --> 02:43:24.810
<v Speaker 3>that I bought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just loved working with them in the</v>

3437
02:43:24.811 --> 02:43:26.490
<v Speaker 3>way that they've just allowed us to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3438
02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:30.380
<v Speaker 3>just allowed us to do our own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3439
02:43:31.220 --> 02:43:33.630
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of trust there and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a leap of faith there and I'd like to</v>

3440
02:43:33.631 --> 02:43:35.580
<v Speaker 3>think we haven't let them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

3441
02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:39.290
<v Speaker 1>well you are definitely onto that trust</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's one of the reasons</v>

3442
02:43:39.291 --> 02:43:42.590
<v Speaker 1>why your shows the first show of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind to be on netflix.</v>

3443
02:43:42.980 --> 02:43:45.950
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's educating a lot of people.</v>

3444
02:43:45.951 --> 02:43:50.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a show that's a show</v>
<v Speaker 1>preaching to the choir,</v>

3445
02:43:50.210 --> 02:43:52.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a show for enthusiasts,</v>

3446
02:43:52.161 --> 02:43:54.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a show that gives you an insight</v>

3447
02:43:54.591 --> 02:43:57.050
<v Speaker 1>and a perspective into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're the guy to do it too,</v>

3448
02:43:57.051 --> 02:43:59.510
<v Speaker 1>because I think the ethics that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>carry,</v>

3449
02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:01.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like here's an important distinction,</v>

3450
02:44:01.921 --> 02:44:06.921
<v Speaker 1>like even though it's legal to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>walkie talkies and certain things in</v>

3451
02:44:07.701 --> 02:44:12.701
<v Speaker 1>some places you don't want to use them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had this thought the other day</v>

3452
02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:18.500
<v Speaker 1>because I was listening to this podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these guys were discussing different</v>

3453
02:44:18.501 --> 02:44:22.070
<v Speaker 1>lenses for optics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're comparing spotting scopes and</v>

3454
02:44:22.071 --> 02:44:25.400
<v Speaker 1>they started talking about walkie</v>
<v Speaker 1>talkies and they got it.</v>

3455
02:44:25.630 --> 02:44:30.630
<v Speaker 1>It became this combination of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guys love because god is love like</v>

3456
02:44:32.270 --> 02:44:37.270
<v Speaker 1>gadgets and tech things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became tech talk and and gadget talk</v>

3457
02:44:38.900 --> 02:44:41.930
<v Speaker 1>mixed with hunting and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started thinking,</v>

3458
02:44:41.931 --> 02:44:42.291
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3459
02:44:42.291 --> 02:44:44.420
<v Speaker 1>when does this end?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it end with drones?</v>

3460
02:44:44.660 --> 02:44:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Does it not end?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it end with what?</v>

3461
02:44:47.010 --> 02:44:48.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if we come up with something</v>

3462
02:44:48.830 --> 02:44:51.010
<v Speaker 3>pharmacy appearing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ending with drones.</v>

3463
02:44:51.011 --> 02:44:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ending with drones,</v>

3464
02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:55.880
<v Speaker 1>but it does if knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

3465
02:44:55.881 --> 02:44:59.330
<v Speaker 1>What's sending a drone up in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it flies over.</v>

3466
02:44:59.331 --> 02:45:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The herd of elk is,</v>

3467
02:45:00.801 --> 02:45:02.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mile to the left.</v>

3468
02:45:02.870 --> 02:45:05.180
<v Speaker 1>We can't see him from here because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a ridge over us,</v>

3469
02:45:05.390 --> 02:45:07.340
<v Speaker 1>but we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know where the wind is.</v>

3470
02:45:07.341 --> 02:45:11.350
<v Speaker 1>We can hook around this way and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>those animals that is in,</v>

3471
02:45:11.630 --> 02:45:14.000
<v Speaker 1>in your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cheating.</v>

3472
02:45:14.110 --> 02:45:16.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>categorically at this point it's</v>

3473
02:45:16.181 --> 02:45:17.770
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it illegal in every state,</v>

3474
02:45:18.070 --> 02:45:22.240
<v Speaker 3>but every state where every state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the state were the states where it</v>

3475
02:45:22.241 --> 02:45:27.241
<v Speaker 3>matters because of having like open</v>
<v Speaker 3>country it is or is becoming and it's</v>

3476
02:45:27.551 --> 02:45:28.810
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to be.</v>

3477
02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:31.600
<v Speaker 3>It's not gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean so many states out and for I</v>

3478
02:45:31.601 --> 02:45:33.880
<v Speaker 3>think 13 or 14 states have banned</v>
<v Speaker 3>drones,</v>

3479
02:45:33.881 --> 02:45:35.230
<v Speaker 3>but it's great that they got out in</v>
<v Speaker 3>front of.</v>

3480
02:45:35.231 --> 02:45:37.100
<v Speaker 3>It sort of came out of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3481
02:45:37.930 --> 02:45:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Two way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Communications is something where a lot</v>

3482
02:45:39.821 --> 02:45:40.570
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3483
02:45:40.570 --> 02:45:42.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some states,</v>

3484
02:45:42.430 --> 02:45:45.310
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not talking like liberal softy</v>
<v Speaker 3>states,</v>

3485
02:45:45.311 --> 02:45:46.180
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Montana,</v>

3486
02:45:46.181 --> 02:45:48.190
<v Speaker 3>Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't use too many communications.</v>

3487
02:45:48.191 --> 02:45:51.730
<v Speaker 3>The hunt because they decided that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where you draw the line because</v>

3488
02:45:52.660 --> 02:45:54.580
<v Speaker 3>they might have even discussed and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethics thing,</v>

3489
02:45:54.581 --> 02:45:57.560
<v Speaker 3>but it's something that goes back to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>great conservationist and writer,</v>

3490
02:45:57.561 --> 02:46:00.640
<v Speaker 3>elder leopold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he had said we spend a lot of</v>

3491
02:46:00.641 --> 02:46:04.120
<v Speaker 3>energy improving the pump but not the</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3492
02:46:04.510 --> 02:46:07.150
<v Speaker 3>so we have a resource,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3493
02:46:07.151 --> 02:46:11.180
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a resource of wild animals and</v>

3494
02:46:11.930 --> 02:46:16.930
<v Speaker 3>if you just work on improving ways to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to pump them out without also working on</v>

3495
02:46:17.811 --> 02:46:21.980
<v Speaker 3>ways of improving the well and having</v>
<v Speaker 3>there be a stable population,</v>

3496
02:46:21.981 --> 02:46:23.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna drain the damn well.</v>

3497
02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:27.860
<v Speaker 3>So when we're looking at as emerging</v>
<v Speaker 3>technologies come out wrong,</v>

3498
02:46:27.940 --> 02:46:29.750
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to constantly ask yourself,</v>

3499
02:46:30.130 --> 02:46:33.650
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with increAsed efficacy,</v>

3500
02:46:33.950 --> 02:46:38.000
<v Speaker 3>like if we get it where technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means that every hunter is always</v>

3501
02:46:38.001 --> 02:46:40.520
<v Speaker 3>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What will that wind up meaning for</v>

3502
02:46:40.521 --> 02:46:43.310
<v Speaker 3>wildlife populations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to mean a diminishment of</v>

3503
02:46:43.311 --> 02:46:46.550
<v Speaker 3>wildlife populations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will mean a tremendous diminishment</v>

3504
02:46:46.551 --> 02:46:49.460
<v Speaker 3>of hunter opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a lot,</v>

3505
02:46:49.461 --> 02:46:51.530
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of over the counter public</v>
<v Speaker 3>land.</v>

3506
02:46:51.610 --> 02:46:56.000
<v Speaker 3>Elkanns constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>American west are about 10 or 20 percent</v>

3507
02:46:56.001 --> 02:46:59.360
<v Speaker 3>success rates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you give out 100 licenses,</v>

3508
02:46:59.750 --> 02:47:04.100
<v Speaker 3>you're going to kill about 15 out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a generalization,</v>

3509
02:47:04.101 --> 02:47:06.590
<v Speaker 3>but generally you give them a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys an opportunity.</v>

3510
02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:10.040
<v Speaker 3>If you have success rates at 100</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent,</v>

3511
02:47:11.150 --> 02:47:12.770
<v Speaker 3>how many tags are you given out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

3512
02:47:13.430 --> 02:47:14.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3513
02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:16.990
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

3514
02:47:17.030 --> 02:47:22.030
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're talking about ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're also talking about access and</v>

3515
02:47:22.341 --> 02:47:26.220
<v Speaker 3>privilege but aren't for you personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't you also talking about the way it</v>

3516
02:47:26.221 --> 02:47:27.050
<v Speaker 3>makes you feel?</v>

3517
02:47:27.050 --> 02:47:28.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>

3518
02:47:28.130 --> 02:47:29.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it makes everybody feel that</v>

3519
02:47:29.331 --> 02:47:31.280
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys that shoots up behind high fence,</v>

3520
02:47:31.281 --> 02:47:32.990
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Defense has never in the picture.</v>

3521
02:47:33.230 --> 02:47:35.870
<v Speaker 3>And guys at radio hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the goddamn radios are never in the</v>

3522
02:47:35.871 --> 02:47:37.730
<v Speaker 3>photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3523
02:47:37.850 --> 02:47:39.920
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see a guy standing there with 10</v>

3524
02:47:39.921 --> 02:47:44.780
<v Speaker 3>people in the photo and you know that</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine of them were up on glass and tits</v>

3525
02:47:44.781 --> 02:47:48.470
<v Speaker 3>with radios</v>
<v Speaker 3>radio and the guy in,</v>

3526
02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:50.540
<v Speaker 3>but they sure should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't wearing the headsets and the</v>

3527
02:47:50.541 --> 02:47:52.340
<v Speaker 3>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they kind of get to that.</v>

3528
02:47:52.341 --> 02:47:57.341
<v Speaker 3>They're not proud of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I would like one way to to,</v>

3529
02:47:58.180 --> 02:48:01.040
<v Speaker 3>to look at things for me is I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3530
02:48:01.041 --> 02:48:03.710
<v Speaker 3>is it something that you kind of tuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>away when it's all over?</v>

3531
02:48:03.711 --> 02:48:05.390
<v Speaker 3>Is this something that celebrated?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3532
02:48:05.590 --> 02:48:07.370
<v Speaker 3>A guy killed south with the bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's some bitch.</v>

3533
02:48:07.371 --> 02:48:09.740
<v Speaker 3>And beau is laying on top of the animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>always.</v>

3534
02:48:10.100 --> 02:48:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

3535
02:48:12.180 --> 02:48:14.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy with the gun maybe.</v>

3536
02:48:14.121 --> 02:48:14.960
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not.</v>
