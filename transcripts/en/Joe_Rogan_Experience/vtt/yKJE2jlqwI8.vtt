00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.573
<v Speaker 1>You're doing a great job.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What did they do to the snake and move this poison glands and I,</v>

159
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.711
<v Speaker 1>the venom sac.</v>

00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.990
<v Speaker 1>So there's no venom in its body damaged.</v>

162
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>They replaced it with fucking</v>

163
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 1>stuff they use for bullying plants,</v>

164
00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:39.671
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

165
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:40.504
<v Speaker 1>you know</v>

166
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.301
<v Speaker 1>silicone,</v>

167
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:44.030
<v Speaker 1>silicone.</v>

168
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Who are these guys to de Judge also,</v>

169
00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:47.010
<v Speaker 2>because Mike didn't tell you,</v>

170
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.650
<v Speaker 2>but one of the judges on that tribunal who was saying,</v>

171
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:50.041
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

172
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:54.060
<v Speaker 2>you're a piece of shit for making fun of a kid after that was found to have</v>

173
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:54.691
<v Speaker 2>kitty porn.</v>

174
00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:55.890
<v Speaker 2>He was some kind of child molester.</v>

175
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.070
<v Speaker 2>He was judging that he was too shitty to a kid.</v>

176
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.860
<v Speaker 2>There were two people at the Human Rights Commission in Quebec that we're one of</v>

177
00:05:01.861 --> 00:05:02.240
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

178
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

179
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.350
<v Speaker 2>what's the precedent that had to resign that he had paid off a 13 year old girl</v>

180
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.940
<v Speaker 2>like 15 years ago to not tell anyone that he had had sex with her.</v>

181
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.320
<v Speaker 2>And then another one,</v>

182
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.750
<v Speaker 2>I think he had had sex with a,</v>

183
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.070
<v Speaker 2>it was a six year old,</v>

184
00:05:17.071 --> 00:05:19.140
<v Speaker 2>like it was fucking crazy.</v>

185
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.820
<v Speaker 2>But these motherfuckers that,</v>

186
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:21.630
<v Speaker 2>that's what I hated.</v>

187
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.170
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

188
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.400
<v Speaker 2>these people were telling me,</v>

189
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.911
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

190
00:05:23.911 --> 00:05:24.630
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

191
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.830
<v Speaker 2>you did a joke onstage and that's all and your intent,</v>

192
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.090
<v Speaker 2>that's what people forget oftentimes in my intent wasn't to hurt this little</v>

193
00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:33.300
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

194
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.280
<v Speaker 2>My intent was to make people laugh.</v>

195
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.420
<v Speaker 2>But these guys,</v>

196
00:05:36.421 --> 00:05:40.680
<v Speaker 2>their intent was to put their dick inside of a child that's fucking,</v>

197
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.660
<v Speaker 2>and they judged him and they judged me.</v>

198
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.950
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy.</v>

199
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.461
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

200
00:05:44.461 --> 00:05:45.990
<v Speaker 2>hypocrisy knows no bounds.</v>

201
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.820
<v Speaker 2>And I think you know anybody that's doing anything like that,</v>

202
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.790
<v Speaker 2>it's just a sickness that's incomprehensible.</v>

203
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.440
<v Speaker 2>These fucking guys,</v>

204
00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:55.740
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

205
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 2>So they put you through some shit like you,</v>

206
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 2>you went through this for a long time.</v>

207
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 2>Like my,</v>

208
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 2>my lawyer went when I first met my lawyer,</v>

209
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.981
<v Speaker 2>I told him,</v>

210
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:04.461
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

211
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:04.641
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

212
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 2>they want you to settle.</v>

213
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.741
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

214
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

215
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.671
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

216
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:08.504
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

217
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 2>get it reduced,</v>

218
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.831
<v Speaker 2>get it reduced.</v>

219
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 2>So like 20 grand.</v>

220
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>

221
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.631
<v Speaker 2>I told him,</v>

222
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:11.901
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

223
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:12.621
<v Speaker 2>if I do that,</v>

224
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking everyone.</v>

225
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Like any comic in Canada is going to be fuck cause I'm going to set this weird</v>

226
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 2>precedent.</v>

227
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.851
<v Speaker 2>So I told him,</v>

228
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

229
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather give you 100,000 then give them five.</v>

230
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.320
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>

231
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.971
<v Speaker 2>but he told me,</v>

232
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

233
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 2>we can't win the,</v>

234
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.120
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

235
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 2>cause I didn't go to court.</v>

236
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.630
<v Speaker 2>I went to the human rights tribunal.</v>

237
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.560
<v Speaker 2>I was judged by the human rights tribunal and the Human Rights Commission was</v>

238
00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 2>bringing me there.</v>

239
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 2>So it was me versus them judged by them.</v>

240
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.331
<v Speaker 2>So he told me,</v>

241
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 2>you're definitely going to lose to the kangaroo court.</v>

242
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

243
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.790
<v Speaker 2>But he said,</v>

244
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

245
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.120
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

246
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

247
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 2>then we'll appeal and the government will probably accept the,</v>

248
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 2>to to listen to the,</v>

249
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:51.890
<v Speaker 2>the case again.</v>

250
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.671
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes,</v>

251
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:53.570
<v Speaker 2>then you'll win that.</v>

252
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.220
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

253
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 2>but so I said yes.</v>

254
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

255
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.421
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

256
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:56.511
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

257
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:57.590
<v Speaker 2>I have to do this.</v>

258
00:06:57.591 --> 00:06:58.424
<v Speaker 2>And I'm out.</v>

259
00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

260
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.910
<v Speaker 2>I loved rocky and there was something weird about,</v>

261
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

262
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 2>this is like fucking rocky too.</v>

263
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be loose and then I'll get out to an LP,</v>

264
00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:08.324
<v Speaker 2>the champ.</v>

265
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

266
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.200

<v Speaker 2>something really weird happened to me though,</v>

269
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.050
<v Speaker 2>is I didn't,</v>

270
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.860
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think it did affect me this much because when I was in court and I saw</v>

271
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:21.320
<v Speaker 2>this kid's family fucking crying,</v>

276
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.390
<v Speaker 2>And I felt it was weird because my,</v>

277
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.001
<v Speaker 2>my joke,</v>

278
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 2>my intent was to make people laugh.</v>

279
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:31.221
<v Speaker 2>And this kid,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

283
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't not like them.</v>

284
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:36.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

285
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

286
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 2>but then to see that they took this,</v>

287
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.610
<v Speaker 2>this seriously and then the,</v>

288
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.980

<v Speaker 2>Mike Ward,</v>

297
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Mike Ward is getting rich off of this little boy and I was doing shows in</v>

298
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.210
<v Speaker 2>Edinburgh that no one makes money.</v>

299
00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.900
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

300
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 2>I was playing like the 200 seat theater and I was like,</v>

301
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:03.741
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

302
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:07.910
<v Speaker 2>these fuckers are making me look like I becoming rich because of this little</v>

303
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:08.180
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

304
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.140
<v Speaker 2>He became a target.</v>

305
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

306
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.760
<v Speaker 2>And then click bait.</v>

307
00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 2>That's how they get people to pay attention.</v>

308
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't think it did affect me,</v>

309
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:15.040
<v Speaker 2>but the thing that,</v>

310
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.700
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason why it did affect,</v>

311
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 2>affect me is if all you get is hate,</v>

312
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.150
<v Speaker 2>you can block it out.</v>

313
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.230
<v Speaker 2>It's super easy to block,</v>

314
00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:21.960
<v Speaker 2>hate out.</v>

315
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 2>And I'll error if all you get is love.</v>

316
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:24.683
<v Speaker 2>That's easy too.</v>

317
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.270
<v Speaker 2>But I was getting hate and love,</v>

318
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:26.720
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

319
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.650
<v Speaker 2>so I'd be like,</v>

320
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

321
00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:29.240
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't let the hate in.</v>

322
00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:31.460
<v Speaker 2>But then someone had shown me love side open up,</v>

323
00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:36.461
<v Speaker 2>and then the hated come in and it was just so fucking weird and F and I was like</v>

324
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:38.290
<v Speaker 2>googling myself too much.</v>

325
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.290
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

326
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:40.123
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>

327
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

328
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:41.091
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

329
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:41.391
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

330
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:41.631
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

331
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:43.090
<v Speaker 2>There's an article about me in,</v>

332
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:43.993
<v Speaker 2>in Russia,</v>

333
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.210
<v Speaker 2>and then I Google translate to see that I'm a piece of garbage.</v>

334
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
