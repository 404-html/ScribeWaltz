1
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Scott adams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Joe.</v>

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you again man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you again.</v>

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met you decades ago.</v>

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horrible story?</v>

6
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember a horrible story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was on news radio was horrible</v>

7
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>stories you remember about humiliation</v>
<v Speaker 1>that day.</v>

8
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for those of you who weren't with us</v>

9
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>on that set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a small line,</v>

10
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.730
<v Speaker 1>just one line on news radio because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was an episode that mentioned Dilbert.</v>

11
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 1>So I was invited as a guest and you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving the line before my line.</v>

12
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.490
<v Speaker 1>So I just came in and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joe is going to say this.</v>

13
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say you're lying and you've turned to me</v>

14
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>and you said you lied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

15
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.270
<v Speaker 1>when he says that you say your line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course I panicked because I,</v>

16
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do this right?</v>

17
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Not An actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the scene starts and it's one of</v>

18
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>these scenes that runs continuous from</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to end.</v>

19
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a movie where you cut it</v>
<v Speaker 1>every 10 seconds.</v>

20
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>So you have to do a ride all the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>through and we get to my,</v>

21
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>my line and you're turning the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

22
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>So the line I'm waiting to hear instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of hearing it clearly,</v>

23
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.340
<v Speaker 1>like in practice when you were facing</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

24
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>I hear Walmart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

25
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>And I think to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what his other lines are,</v>

26
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.040
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know if that sounds like my</v>
<v Speaker 1>line or is that,</v>

27
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>should I go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said to myself,</v>

28
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>50 slash 50 chance</v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

29
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Either ruin the scene by saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>something the wrong time or I ruined the</v>

30
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 1>scene by being silent when I should've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been talking.</v>

31
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>So I said I'm going to go with silent</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just,</v>

32
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I just stood there in silence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>

33
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>everybody got really quiet.</v>

34
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you remember why you</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

35
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>But uh oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's burned in my mind.</v>

36
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>You were very nice that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just sort of slowly turned</v>

37
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>around and looked at me and meanwhile</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other actors sort of slowly</v>

38
00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>turned around and looked at me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the source of the problem.</v>

39
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.493
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>but I have to admit I was impressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that all the actors went back to</v>

41
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>square one and did the entire scene</v>
<v Speaker 1>through again,</v>

42
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is very impressive if you're not</v>

43
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:11.661
<v Speaker 1>an actor to watch how many lines a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of professionals can do without screwing</v>

44
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>up any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

45
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.430
<v Speaker 1>it was an awesome kind of an afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>news radio was a very unusual show in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we did.</v>

48
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of changing stuff on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly.</v>

49
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Like the writers come in and rewrite a</v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

50
00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>like on the fly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they would do one line that we do</v>

51
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>one take and then Paul Sams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josh Lieb on these guys would get</v>

52
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>together and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

53
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try this.</v>

54
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Let's try this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go back.</v>

55
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>But then when he went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott turns to you now to say this and</v>

56
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:39.840
<v Speaker 1>then we'd have a totally new line for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next scene.</v>

57
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>And so we'd have to like be standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>over there by the elevator going,</v>

58
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not gonna work.</v>

59
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not gonna work.</v>

60
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 1>We do like come up with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways to say it and then just</v>

61
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>run with it on the fly and people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize how hard that is.</v>

62
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that hard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

63
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>it's not coal mining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will you have to have the right</v>

64
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.260
<v Speaker 1>kind of mind for them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Memory?</v>

65
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like when a musician</v>

66
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 2>can do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 songs from memory.</v>

67
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm thinking I could do seven notes,</v>

68
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm good.</v>

69
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 2>That's all I can remember in a row and</v>
<v Speaker 2>after that it'd be just be guessing.</v>

70
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about how many you just</v>

71
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 2>think about language itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many words you can access just</v>

72
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 2>instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just pulled them up from your memory.</v>

73
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that's what you do all the</v>

74
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 2>time and if you all the time we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading sitcoms,</v>

75
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 2>scripts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just get used to that sort of flow</v>

76
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 2>and how things go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

77
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 2>it's not really that everything looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult if you don't know how to do</v>

78
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

79
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say that about my job as well as</v>

80
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.750
<v Speaker 2>how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

81
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens to be the one thing I can do</v>

82
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:44.161
<v Speaker 2>well and I can't do most things well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one little thing I can do well.</v>

83
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing that people have a hard time</v>

84
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 2>with the Sitcom world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the old school sitcom world</v>

85
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:52.010
<v Speaker 2>is the audience like performing in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the audience.</v>

86
00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:54.870
<v Speaker 2>This is a weird element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

87
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 2>I do feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

88
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do tons of public speaking,</v>

89
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 2>so in that environment I liked the</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy and I like all of it,</v>

90
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 2>but usually if I'm speaking I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what I'm going to say and even</v>

91
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 2>if I mess it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

92
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be specific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was a,</v>

93
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 2>that was a frightening situation</v>
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>

94
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so keep in mind also that most of the</v>

95
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 2>actors were stars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

96
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were pretty big names and so I was</v>

97
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 2>meeting everybody that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was a little bit star struck and</v>

98
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:25.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was completely out of my element and</v>

99
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 2>that completely blew the scene.</v>

100
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just me.</v>

101
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.990
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

102
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:30.720
<v Speaker 2>maybe there wasn't anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just me,</v>

103
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.040
<v Speaker 2>sounds like I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like I was looking in the wrong</v>

104
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 2>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is totally possible.</v>

105
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 2>We were standing in line so you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be facing the way you were,</v>

106
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.450
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

107
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was looking at you during the</v>

108
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 2>rehearsal or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

109
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 2>the setup was we were standing in line</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get coffee and so during the practice</v>

110
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:51.580
<v Speaker 2>you turned to me so you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would know exactly what you were</v>

111
00:04:51.581 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the actual thing we were in line.</v>

112
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking to somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

113
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

114
00:04:56.381 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

115
00:04:57.611 --> 00:04:59.080
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember that at all.</v>

116
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's so funny how like one</v>
<v Speaker 2>person can remember something and it's</v>

117
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:05.000
<v Speaker 2>like a big moment and then another</v>
<v Speaker 2>person go,</v>

118
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just erased that.</v>

119
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Well I knew that I met you and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember,</v>

120
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott Adams is cool.</v>

121
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I like that cartoon and then all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden it's over.</v>

122
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.291
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was that.</v>

123
00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

124
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 2>there's no other memories in my database</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a totally different experience that</v>

125
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.380
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

126
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.540
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did 100 of them or 98 or whatever the</v>

127
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:23.640
<v Speaker 2>hell we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

128
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.040
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing as you get older too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

129
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.450
<v Speaker 2>there's memories that I just have</v>
<v Speaker 2>scrubbed.</v>

130
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no room for him.</v>

131
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 2>I got new data coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to make some space.</v>

132
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like cleaning out your garage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 2>so there's nothing scarier than getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>together with your siblings after you</v>

134
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:41.200
<v Speaker 2>haven't seen him for years and you start</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about your childhood and one of</v>

135
00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 2>you will be telling the story like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you remember the time?</v>

136
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:44.940
<v Speaker 2>I know it doesn't matter what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

137
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I jumped on a zebra and I ran it across</v>
<v Speaker 2>the zoo and they read the Ltb and the</v>

138
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:51.430
<v Speaker 2>other sibling will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't you.</v>

139
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 2>That was me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the one on the zebra.</v>

140
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.850
<v Speaker 2>It'll be such like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

141
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 2>a memory</v>

142
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>that you couldn't forget what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually wrote yourself into a</v>

143
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You weren't even there.</v>

144
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:05.650
<v Speaker 1>You were watching and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wrote yourself into the hero's</v>

145
00:06:05.651 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>theme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does happen with people.</v>

146
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Human Memories really flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really flawed.</v>

147
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to go real deep real fast,</v>

148
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.590
<v Speaker 1>you just gave me the good opening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

149
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a proponent of the,</v>

150
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:22.050
<v Speaker 1>we are all a software simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

151
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.100
<v Speaker 1>view of reality and that would also</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain why memories are so screwed up</v>

152
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 1>and the explanation would be that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past doesn't exist until you need it.</v>

153
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past writes itself on demand because</v>

154
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:40.260
<v Speaker 1>if we're software you wouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in the universe preprogram</v>

155
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.280
<v Speaker 1>just in case you needed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would take too much resources.</v>

156
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I might have to spark up a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just want real deep,</v>

157
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:47.650
<v Speaker 1>real quick.</v>

158
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping I was hoping to go that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

159
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you want some smoke?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weed?</v>

160
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I could do it for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be willing to try it once.</v>

161
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I want to give it to you</v>

162
00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>for the first time and I want you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>freak out.</v>

163
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't smoke pot at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is I smoked pot once ever was</v>

164
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.810
<v Speaker 1>in first day of college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never stopped.</v>

165
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.000
<v Speaker 1>So that's really just once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

166
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.040
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you smoked pot all the time,</v>

167
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 1>so he did it once and you just kept</v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

168
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I'd be willing to try it a second time</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what I'm saying.</v>

169
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you're saying.</v>

170
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.740
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

171
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.980
<v Speaker 3>What you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what has life been like for Scott Adams</v>

172
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.520
<v Speaker 3>during this election?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

173
00:07:27.521 --> 00:07:29.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came into the,</v>

174
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.200
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're obviously always well known for</v>

175
00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:34.090
<v Speaker 3>being a creator of Dilbert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

176
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm along selection cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden there was,</v>

177
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.770
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

178
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.140
<v Speaker 3>people that are already in contact with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were saying,</v>

179
00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:46.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scott Adams is a trump supporter.</v>

180
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.590
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

181
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.080
<v Speaker 3>Scott Adams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Dilbert guys and trump supporter</v>

182
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:55.290
<v Speaker 3>because everyone assumes you meet</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone and they're a,</v>

183
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.910
<v Speaker 3>in the creative business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

184
00:07:57.911 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 3>you're in a creative business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

185
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.010
<v Speaker 3>you write a comic strip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would assume that you would be left</v>

186
00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:05.920
<v Speaker 3>wing guy like almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost immediately.</v>

187
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm neither left nor right.</v>

188
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

189
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.830
<v Speaker 1>my views didn't match,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

190
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 1>either of the major candidates on</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

191
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.750
<v Speaker 1>So you're a free thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to think I'm right and everybody</v>

192
00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:20.120
<v Speaker 1>else was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like that too.</v>

193
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

194
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:28.270
<v Speaker 1>my larger philosophical grounding is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is informed by my experience as a</v>

195
00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:30.560
<v Speaker 1>hypnotist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if you knew that.</v>

196
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know you're a hypnotist.</v>

197
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.930
<v Speaker 1>So in my twenties I went to hypnosis</v>
<v Speaker 1>school and became an actual train</v>

198
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 1>certified hypnotist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

199
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you learn as a</v>

200
00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:44.540
<v Speaker 1>hypnotist is that the world is backwards</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the way people normally perceive it.</v>

201
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.630
<v Speaker 1>So normally you see the world as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

202
00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of the time people are</v>

203
00:08:49.371 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Speaker 1>irrational and doing rational things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 10 percent of the time we just go</v>

204
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 1>knots and we do stupid things and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>because something happened.</v>

205
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.203
<v Speaker 1>This sparked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

206
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the normal view of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hypnotist view of the world is</v>

207
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 1>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hypnotist says that 90 percent of</v>

208
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:07.710
<v Speaker 1>the time we're a completely irrational</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're just making rationalizations</v>

209
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:11.340
<v Speaker 1>for why we did things after the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten percent of the time we're rational.</v>

210
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.030
<v Speaker 1>But that's only when there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional content to the decision.</v>

211
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're balancing a checkbook or</v>

212
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:17.101
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

213
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:18.120
<v Speaker 1>trying to pick a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

214
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:21.170
<v Speaker 1>the best route to someplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

215
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.420
<v Speaker 1>so that's how I see the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I look at either the trump</v>

216
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 1>supporters or the Clinton supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me from the hypnotist perspective and</v>

217
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:31.530
<v Speaker 1>someone who's studied persuasion for</v>
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>

218
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.500
<v Speaker 1>I used it in my writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

219
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 1>I see both sides as completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous both and both of them are</v>

220
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 1>grounded in complete absurdity is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just different.</v>

221
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But nobody knows why they're deciding</v>

222
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.520
<v Speaker 1>the real reasons that people make</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

223
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Our fear identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

224
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have some aspiration,</v>

225
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.620
<v Speaker 1>they've got something they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve.</v>

226
00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:56.820
<v Speaker 1>There's something that they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work out,</v>

227
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 1>but the reasons we give are usually</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely false.</v>

228
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.880
<v Speaker 1>And the grounding for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you think about evolution,</v>

229
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.820
<v Speaker 1>I assume you believe we evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

230
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no requirement in evolution</v>

231
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 1>that we ever understand our environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we imagined we do.</v>

232
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:22.560
<v Speaker 1>And here's an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could believe that you are a monk.</v>

233
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.340
<v Speaker 1>You know you're reincarnated from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>10th century monk like Steven Seagal.</v>

234
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.750
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believe that,</v>

235
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a Buddha or something from an</v>

236
00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 1>actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he actually got it bestowed upon</v>

237
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:35.580
<v Speaker 1>him by some Tibetan character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

238
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:39.600
<v Speaker 1>so let's use Steven Seagal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Steven Seagal can be standing in a</v>

239
00:10:39.601 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 1>grocery store next to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say a Muslim who believes that his</v>

240
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.170
<v Speaker 1>profit literally flew to heaven on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>winged horse.</v>

241
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Those two people don't live the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

242
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.390
<v Speaker 1>but they both buy groceries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They both go,</v>

243
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 1>they cook it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live,</v>

244
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.030
<v Speaker 1>they survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out that understanding your</v>

245
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:58.000
<v Speaker 1>reality at an actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.590
<v Speaker 1>I really know what is objectively</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and I get it and I've got a</v>

247
00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:04.920
<v Speaker 1>mental model that's quite accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need any of that.</v>

248
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:10.200
<v Speaker 1>So it would be deeply unlikely that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved such a specific skill that's</v>

249
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:12.570
<v Speaker 1>completely unnecessary as far as we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>

250
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do need to know that if I,</v>

251
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.250
<v Speaker 1>if you run into this wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your head is going to hurt.</v>

252
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.400
<v Speaker 1>So there's some basic stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're probably all in even</v>

253
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:22.230
<v Speaker 1>interpreting that experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

254
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.840
<v Speaker 1>So there's no reason to think that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way I think of it as the way you think</v>

255
00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:27.750
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I see the world is this big</v>

256
00:11:27.751 --> 00:11:32.751
<v Speaker 1>irrational ball and I use the hypnotist</v>
<v Speaker 1>persuaders skills to back up and try to</v>

257
00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:35.214
<v Speaker 1>deduce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

258
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.780
<v Speaker 1>what's really driving things.</v>

259
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 1>And when people said that was a trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>supporter,</v>

260
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.350
<v Speaker 1>what they meant was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

261
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.940
<v Speaker 1>they may have only seen part of what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about.</v>

262
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.430
<v Speaker 1>I was writing about his skill as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>persuader.</v>

263
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:53.350
<v Speaker 1>And what I mean is that I noticed in him</v>
<v Speaker 1>the skills that I've over decades for</v>

264
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 1>persuasion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had a higher level than I've ever</v>

265
00:11:58.061 --> 00:12:02.050
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning that he is the most persuasive</v>

266
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.500
<v Speaker 1>living human I've ever experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that in terms of actual</v>

267
00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:09.340
<v Speaker 1>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

268
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:11.230
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's full of technique and it's all the</v>

269
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.780
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you,</v>

270
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.570
<v Speaker 1>give you some examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That first time I noticed it was the</v>

271
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.600
<v Speaker 1>very first debate when Megan Kelly was</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking him the question about the</v>

272
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:24.530
<v Speaker 1>insults he had allegedly said to women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not allegedly.</v>

273
00:12:24.531 --> 00:12:28.930
<v Speaker 1>You said them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a setup that any other</v>

274
00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:33.460
<v Speaker 1>politician with this setup is totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped because they can either try to</v>

275
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.740
<v Speaker 1>deny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they set it and then somebody has a</v>

276
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:37.240
<v Speaker 1>videotape and that doesn't work.</v>

277
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Or they can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

278
00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:41.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's almost nothing you can say.</v>

279
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.230
<v Speaker 1>You're just trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would've been the end of his</v>

280
00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:46.390
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First debate should have been over.</v>

281
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.730
<v Speaker 1>And if you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember what he said?</v>

282
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.593
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

283
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.140
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said this,</v>

284
00:12:51.141 --> 00:12:53.710
<v Speaker 1>this and this about women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he smiled.</v>

285
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.740
<v Speaker 1>He sort of looked at the audience and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like or the camera.</v>

286
00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:02.000
<v Speaker 1>And he said only Rosie O'donnell and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience erupted in laughter.</v>

287
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Completely unexpected and a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate.</v>

288
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Provocative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I noticed was that Rosie</v>

289
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.850
<v Speaker 1>O'donnell is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a visual image that everybody shares,</v>

290
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a picture of her soon,</v>

291
00:13:14.251 --> 00:13:18.040
<v Speaker 1>as I say the name and for his base that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was catering to.</v>

292
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.870
<v Speaker 1>It was an unpopular image and one that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would just suck all the energy away from</v>

293
00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:24.790
<v Speaker 1>the question which was toxic.</v>

294
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.130
<v Speaker 1>And really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

295
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.530
<v Speaker 1>you can't touch the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to suck all the energy</v>

296
00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:32.410
<v Speaker 1>into another part of the room and wait</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the time to run out.</v>

297
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's what he did and it became the</v>
<v Speaker 1>headline,</v>

298
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.641
<v Speaker 1>Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>

299
00:13:35.641 --> 00:13:36.474
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

300
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>

301
00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highlighted the things he said about</v>

302
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:42.820
<v Speaker 1>women maybe more than it would have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way he escaped that got my</v>

303
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:45.460
<v Speaker 1>attention and I thought that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>look normal,</v>

304
00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.573
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

305
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.180
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's operating at another level.</v>

306
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:54.160
<v Speaker 1>And so I looked for more examples of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see it everywhere and it was</v>

307
00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:56.440
<v Speaker 1>especially clear by the time you started</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

308
00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other visual things he does is he</v>

309
00:13:59.831 --> 00:14:02.490
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build a wall and you can just imagine a</v>

310
00:14:02.491 --> 00:14:04.650
<v Speaker 1>wall when he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

311
00:14:04.651 --> 00:14:07.060
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're paying too much ransom to Iran for</v>

312
00:14:07.061 --> 00:14:08.080
<v Speaker 1>those soldiers.</v>

313
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.150
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we paid $400,</v>

314
00:14:10.151 --> 00:14:11.200
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever the number is.</v>

315
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.420
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that money piled up.</v>

316
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.240
<v Speaker 1>It'd be so much money you would fill</v>
<v Speaker 1>this room.</v>

317
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 1>You can't even imagine that big pile of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

318
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.770
<v Speaker 1>He always goes to the visual because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that the visual part of our</v>

319
00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:24.940
<v Speaker 1>brayden's the dominant part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can get its attention and get it</v>

320
00:14:24.941 --> 00:14:27.580
<v Speaker 1>on your message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it talks to the rest of your brain into</v>

321
00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:29.520
<v Speaker 1>anything you want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

322
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.590
<v Speaker 1>when he talks about Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes visual also.</v>

323
00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:38.100
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't say they are bad people who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>religions has been distorted to the type</v>

324
00:14:38.531 --> 00:14:40.390
<v Speaker 1>of thing you might hear from Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton.</v>

325
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:45.280
<v Speaker 1>He says they put you in cages and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>trained you in the cage.</v>

326
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.930
<v Speaker 1>They chop your head off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can see that you're playing</v>

327
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 1>in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everything he does,</v>

328
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.760
<v Speaker 1>he gets more attention than everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else does because he puts it</v>

329
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 1>into a provocative picture.</v>

330
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.740
<v Speaker 1>So that was the first thing I noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when he got to Jeb Bush and he</v>

331
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:05.480
<v Speaker 1>needed to defeat Jeb because he was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>strongest competitor.</v>

332
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.340
<v Speaker 1>So if he couldn't get past two of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no point.</v>

333
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 1>And he went after him and strong and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>went after him fast and he went after</v>

334
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 1>him with a low energy kill shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I call these linguistic kill</v>

335
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:18.140
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just an insult.</v>

336
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:22.280
<v Speaker 1>It was not just a clever nickname.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we saw Clinton tried to come up with</v>

337
00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:25.550
<v Speaker 1>clever nicknames that had no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no purchase whatsoever,</v>

338
00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:27.020
<v Speaker 1>like dangerous Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

339
00:15:27.021 --> 00:15:29.450
<v Speaker 1>it just didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look at the.</v>

340
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Look at low Energy Jeb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's how it's engineered.</v>

341
00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:36.710
<v Speaker 1>It's engineered for confirmation bias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that you want the future to make</v>

342
00:15:36.711 --> 00:15:39.410
<v Speaker 1>this look like a better nickname every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

343
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.480
<v Speaker 1>And you want it to match his</v>
<v Speaker 1>physicality.</v>

344
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:47.020
<v Speaker 1>So before I ever heard low energy Jeb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a good impression of Jeb Bush.</v>

345
00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.210
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at Jeb Bush,</v>

346
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.410
<v Speaker 1>didn't you say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

347
00:15:52.411 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a cool character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if no,</v>

348
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.870
<v Speaker 1>but he looked like he was an incontrol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm calm,</v>

349
00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:02.860
<v Speaker 1>reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the person you'd want if that.</v>

350
00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:07.610
<v Speaker 1>If the nuclear question came up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was some big decision Jeb Bush</v>

351
00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:11.740
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to get excited about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seemed like a competent CEO competency.</v>

352
00:16:11.741 --> 00:16:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

353
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.580
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as trump said low energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you see him?</v>

354
00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:20.420
<v Speaker 1>And the other way he was low energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low energy,</v>

355
00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:22.220
<v Speaker 1>lying ted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lying ted.</v>

356
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Lying Ted was beautiful because you knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because he's a politician,</v>

357
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.670
<v Speaker 1>sometime in the next several months he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to say stuff that you can say is a</v>

358
00:16:30.671 --> 00:16:32.170
<v Speaker 1>lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it is or not,</v>

359
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:36.250
<v Speaker 1>just it doesn't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly a ted has a</v>

360
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:41.650
<v Speaker 1>physicality about him that unfortunately</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got beady eyes and I've said this</v>

361
00:16:42.141 --> 00:16:43.940
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to cast a movie,</v>

362
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need a guy who's looks dishonest.</v>

363
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:51.200
<v Speaker 1>It would be his face and unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

364
00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:53.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's actually dishonest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to make a judgment.</v>

365
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:59.490
<v Speaker 1>So came up with the Zodiac killer thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that a trump fan or was it trump</v>

366
00:16:59.871 --> 00:17:02.780
<v Speaker 1>himself that started saying that Ted was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Zodiac killer.</v>

367
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I think that probably started with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fan,</v>

368
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.960
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the other thing that was fucking</v>

369
00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:10.760
<v Speaker 1>harsh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he be given speeches.</v>

370
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Are you the Zodiac killer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would scream it out like you</v>

371
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:18.770
<v Speaker 1>imagine having to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And did your father killed somebody?</v>

372
00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

373
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His father was maybe dad was the Zodiac</v>

374
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:24.030
<v Speaker 1>killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that with the Zodiac killer?</v>

375
00:17:24.031 --> 00:17:25.320
<v Speaker 1>It was like the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

376
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Might not be old enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

377
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.280
<v Speaker 1>so crooked Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crooked Hillary,</v>

378
00:17:31.281 --> 00:17:33.230
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>circle millions of brilliant one.</v>

379
00:17:33.231 --> 00:17:35.480
<v Speaker 1>So she wasn't physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

380
00:17:35.481 --> 00:17:40.070
<v Speaker 1>as limber as a young person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could imagine her sort of a</v>

381
00:17:40.071 --> 00:17:43.250
<v Speaker 1>little bit crooked physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you knew that there would be stories</v>

382
00:17:43.251 --> 00:17:45.800
<v Speaker 1>coming out in which people could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

383
00:17:45.801 --> 00:17:48.020
<v Speaker 1>there's another example of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>crookedness did you see?</v>

384
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:49.890
<v Speaker 1>But you thought that that a physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

385
00:17:49.891 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

386
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.290
<v Speaker 2>the way she looked all I thought about</v>
<v Speaker 2>his corruption,</v>

387
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.670
<v Speaker 2>I heard Crooked Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw her like with like a burglar's</v>

388
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.740
<v Speaker 2>mask on trying to sneak away with bags</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had dollar signs on them.</v>

389
00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I saw.</v>

390
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 2>If you look at anyone of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>individually,</v>

391
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:03.960
<v Speaker 2>his nickname's you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>

392
00:18:03.961 --> 00:18:05.050
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of random.</v>

393
00:18:05.051 --> 00:18:06.840
<v Speaker 2>He just got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at a ball,</v>

394
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.300
<v Speaker 2>they all have that physicality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all have the,</v>

395
00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the priming so that,</v>

396
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll confirmation bias will kick in.</v>

397
00:18:14.191 --> 00:18:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After that,</v>

398
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.940
<v Speaker 2>we'll just fit the label because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you think,</v>

399
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.170
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a performer.</v>

400
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:20.181
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

401
00:18:20.181 --> 00:18:21.690
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say Donald Trump is a</v>

402
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:23.280
<v Speaker 2>businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He most certainly is.</v>

403
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:27.660
<v Speaker 2>It certainly is a real estate investor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's been a public figure for</v>

404
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:31.740
<v Speaker 2>decades and when you're a public figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a performer and he's performing</v>

405
00:18:31.741 --> 00:18:35.370
<v Speaker 2>all the time and he's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he likes to win.</v>

406
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 2>And so when he's engaging in people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he makes it personal.</v>

407
00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:40.860
<v Speaker 2>So he's gotten very good at what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>called playing the dozens,</v>

408
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing the dozens is tell us it's a</v>

409
00:18:43.471 --> 00:18:44.670
<v Speaker 2>insult thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

410
00:18:44.671 --> 00:18:48.780
<v Speaker 2>like you can like one guy like guys in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hood,</v>

411
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:53.190
<v Speaker 2>in the inner cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this started out as a black term,</v>

412
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.880
<v Speaker 2>but it's essentially like a version of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mama contest.</v>

413
00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 2>Like some guys are way better at your</v>
<v Speaker 2>mama jokes.</v>

414
00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.180
<v Speaker 2>They're way better at playing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dozens.</v>

415
00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:04.020
<v Speaker 2>They're way better at shitting on other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people around them.</v>

416
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:05.490
<v Speaker 2>And it's for the entertainment of each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

417
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.480
<v Speaker 2>So huge thing amongst comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shit on each other constantly left</v>

418
00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:11.940
<v Speaker 2>and right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's generally encouraged and we all</v>

419
00:19:11.941 --> 00:19:12.850
<v Speaker 2>enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

420
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.650
<v Speaker 2>but when a guy has decades and decades</v>
<v Speaker 2>and decades of this like Donald Trump,</v>

421
00:19:17.651 --> 00:19:21.690
<v Speaker 2>but a very high level because he's known</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a billionaire investor who puts</v>

422
00:19:21.691 --> 00:19:23.880
<v Speaker 2>his name on everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and still win big,</v>

423
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.120
<v Speaker 2>which I talk about developing systems</v>
<v Speaker 2>for succeeding.</v>

424
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.670
<v Speaker 2>One of the systems is to you do this to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a stack together,</v>

425
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.900
<v Speaker 2>what I would call ordinary skills until</v>
<v Speaker 2>your stack is different than anybody</v>

426
00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:38.430
<v Speaker 2>else's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in my case,</v>

427
00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a great artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't take any writing courses,</v>

428
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.130
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pretty good at drawing and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty good at writing a little bit of</v>

429
00:19:47.131 --> 00:19:50.090
<v Speaker 2>funny so it put them together and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't do a comic strip because it's</v>

430
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.820
<v Speaker 2>rare that you get somebody who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say in the top 10 percent of three</v>

431
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:56.280
<v Speaker 2>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not hard to be in the top 10</v>

432
00:19:56.281 --> 00:19:58.350
<v Speaker 2>percent of things if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going after them.</v>

433
00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:01.620
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a book on negotiating.</v>

434
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.830
<v Speaker 2>So he knows business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows negotiating.</v>

435
00:20:04.831 --> 00:20:07.320
<v Speaker 2>He knows public speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a sense of humor,</v>

436
00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.380
<v Speaker 2>a really good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's quick on his feet now.</v>

437
00:20:10.381 --> 00:20:13.410
<v Speaker 2>He knows politics from both the inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the outside.</v>

438
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows twitter.</v>

439
00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:16.120
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

440
00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.190
<v Speaker 2>I could probably go on and you would say</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you looked at any one of those</v>

441
00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:22.710
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not the best you've ever seen.</v>

442
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not the best public speaker,</v>

443
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:28.860
<v Speaker 2>the funniest person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc. But there aren't many people who</v>

444
00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:31.650
<v Speaker 2>can do all of those things in the top 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

445
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.100
<v Speaker 2>You put it as a puBlic speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's nearly in the top 10</v>

446
00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:36.970
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a,</v>

447
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:38.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just being honest.</v>

448
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:41.920
<v Speaker 2>I think he has a very poor efficiency</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

449
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.020
<v Speaker 2>of words like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

450
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.770
<v Speaker 2>he uses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he repeats himself when it's not really</v>

451
00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.360
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when it repeats itself,</v>

452
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.720
<v Speaker 2>what I usually see is like someone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>searching for the next thing to say,</v>

453
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.160
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he'll say,</v>

454
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna,</v>

455
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.550
<v Speaker 2>be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be honest with you.</v>

456
00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be honest with you here.</v>

457
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.870
<v Speaker 2>He'll do that in a way that is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not efficient,</v>

458
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.030
<v Speaker 2>not efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's persuasive in this way</v>

459
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.710
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also.</v>

460
00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.530
<v Speaker 2>No repetition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>repetition sometimes.</v>

461
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes it's clunky.</v>

462
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he.</v>

463
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there's a lot of times where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's his style to do that and he's done</v>

464
00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:22.750
<v Speaker 2>it before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even like in delivering lines,</v>

465
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.620
<v Speaker 2>you've got to know when to not talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like here's a perfect example.</v>

466
00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.280
<v Speaker 2>When he said that he called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>president of the president of Mexico up</v>

467
00:21:30.281 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 2>and they had the conversation about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wall and he said,</v>

468
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:34.150
<v Speaker 2>the wall just got 10 foot higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

469
00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:35.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I said.</v>

470
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.630
<v Speaker 2>That is what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he repeats that said he should've</v>

471
00:21:37.631 --> 00:21:40.180
<v Speaker 2>just let it hang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He should have just said the wall just</v>

472
00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:40.930
<v Speaker 2>got 10 foot high.</v>

473
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.770
<v Speaker 2>They would've went crazy and you gotta</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk back and forth and just sucked it</v>

474
00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:46.090
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he kept talking.</v>

475
00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.480
<v Speaker 2>So that's not the best speaker like</v>
<v Speaker 2>obama.</v>

476
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I feels way better public speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way more efficient with his words,</v>

477
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:57.190
<v Speaker 2>way better control of the sentences that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he speaks,</v>

478
00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.260
<v Speaker 2>but it's more professional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're judging a standard that I</v>

479
00:22:02.261 --> 00:22:04.900
<v Speaker 2>probably wouldn't use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I took the dale carnegie course</v>

480
00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:09.430
<v Speaker 2>teaching you how to be a public speaker</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their course taught you a zero</v>

481
00:22:09.431 --> 00:22:10.620
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

482
00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.020
<v Speaker 2>it was a course on public speaking in</v>
<v Speaker 2>which theY tell you nothing about</v>

483
00:22:14.021 --> 00:22:15.850
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The things that you're saying he's</v>

484
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.920
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily technique.</v>

485
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just finish this off shore.</v>

486
00:22:19.151 --> 00:22:21.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they tell you is just confidence</v>

487
00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:24.400
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you were happy and confident,</v>

488
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.920
<v Speaker 2>you would almost always do well even if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make a mistake,</v>

489
00:22:26.921 --> 00:22:27.754
<v Speaker 2>you correct.</v>

490
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.960
<v Speaker 2>so he strikes me as the confident dale</v>
<v Speaker 2>carnegie type of speaker,</v>

491
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.220
<v Speaker 2>the person who's selling an emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an experience.</v>

492
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.350
<v Speaker 2>You're not going there really to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

493
00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.710
<v Speaker 2>It's not really a well crafted joke</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll looking for.</v>

494
00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.710
<v Speaker 2>You're going there to feel something and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

495
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:49.510
<v Speaker 2>You can't deny that 30,000 people in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>stadium with red hats on know they were</v>

496
00:22:49.511 --> 00:22:53.110
<v Speaker 2>feeling something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in terms of delivering and emotion,</v>

497
00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.510
<v Speaker 2>top 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

498
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

499
00:22:56.921 --> 00:23:01.921
<v Speaker 2>I think that for absolutely one thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say is he knows how to do the</v>

500
00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:06.790
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump thing and the Donald Trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is very different than the rest of</v>

501
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:09.910
<v Speaker 2>the politicians thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Donald Trump thing is not humble.</v>

502
00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:14.800
<v Speaker 2>The Donald Trump thing will tell you</v>
<v Speaker 2>about his past successes and use them to</v>

503
00:23:14.801 --> 00:23:16.600
<v Speaker 2>tell you how he's going to be successful</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the future.</v>

504
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.350
<v Speaker 2>The Donald Trump thing when confronted</v>
<v Speaker 2>with certain things like the thing about</v>

505
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:21.610
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know him saying something about</v>

506
00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:22.900
<v Speaker 2>hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lacking stamina,</v>

507
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:25.270
<v Speaker 2>and then you start goes off about having</v>
<v Speaker 2>a winning temperament.</v>

508
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.090
<v Speaker 2>I have a winning temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of people who could do</v>

509
00:23:28.091 --> 00:23:33.091
<v Speaker 2>that in that sort of a political forum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if if say mitt romney was running</v>

510
00:23:33.911 --> 00:23:34.990
<v Speaker 2>for president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he started saying,</v>

511
00:23:34.991 --> 00:23:36.410
<v Speaker 2>I have a winning temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

512
00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.120
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

513
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.010
<v Speaker 2>ms dot gone fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

514
00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.880
<v Speaker 2>You remember how howard dean got knocked</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the race just for screaming.</v>

515
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.290
<v Speaker 2>He just screamed at a rally and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

516
00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 2>The wind came out</v>

517
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.030
<v Speaker 3>of the balloon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

518
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.600
<v Speaker 3>you know what howard dean did wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you always screamed once,</v>

519
00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.150
<v Speaker 3>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all about contrast.</v>

520
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:54.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he also didn't make fun of it,</v>

521
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he should have come on and he should</v>

522
00:23:57.031 --> 00:23:59.900
<v Speaker 3>have done something to make fun of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He should've had a speech where he</v>

523
00:23:59.901 --> 00:24:02.090
<v Speaker 3>talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got a little carried away folks,</v>

524
00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he,</v>

525
00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:04.490
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hid from it.</v>

526
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.440
<v Speaker 3>It feels like he could have fixed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

527
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:08.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had that at the time.</v>

528
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the problem was it was contrary to</v>

529
00:24:11.301 --> 00:24:14.300
<v Speaker 3>what he was selling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was selling this buttoned up,</v>

530
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:19.100
<v Speaker 3>packaged deal and in the middle of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>package deal is a fucking pro wrestling</v>

531
00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:21.310
<v Speaker 3>fans screaming from a suplex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

532
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:26.120
<v Speaker 3>like hulk hogan suplexes the iron sheik.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean that's what it was like.</v>

533
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:27.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the guy who,</v>

534
00:24:27.111 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 3>you want to have the button.</v>

535
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.140
<v Speaker 1>So have you heard of these studies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this has been replicated in</v>

536
00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.910
<v Speaker 1>fairly reliable that if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>addict somebody to something,</v>

537
00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.590
<v Speaker 1>let's say this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your show,</v>

538
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.640
<v Speaker 1>if you gave them a really good product</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time,</v>

539
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:46.140
<v Speaker 1>it actually wouldn't be as addictive as</v>
<v Speaker 1>if once in a while it wasn't good and</v>

540
00:24:46.141 --> 00:24:48.000
<v Speaker 1>they had to sort of like wait and</v>
<v Speaker 1>anticipate,</v>

541
00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.560
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that good weather again.</v>

542
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:54.930
<v Speaker 1>So a unpredIctable rewards are far more</v>
<v Speaker 1>addicting than predictable.</v>

543
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:58.580
<v Speaker 1>So a hillary clinton who reward you</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time and it,</v>

544
00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:03.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's just about the same is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna be nearly as addicting as Donald</v>

545
00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who disappoints the fuck out of you?</v>

546
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.270
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>

547
00:25:06.271 --> 00:25:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I was just starting to like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you say that that way?</v>

548
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.380
<v Speaker 1>And then two weeks later he comes out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with something.</v>

549
00:25:13.381 --> 00:25:14.340
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

550
00:25:14.341 --> 00:25:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I love you again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

551
00:25:15.871 --> 00:25:18.570
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got that addictive pattern going.</v>

552
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.170
<v Speaker 3>Well I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once all that grab the pussy stuff got</v>

553
00:25:21.171 --> 00:25:24.110
<v Speaker 3>out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was doIng a lot of speeches and the</v>

554
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:28.060
<v Speaker 3>rundown the last few days and I watched</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few of them on television because I</v>

555
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.120
<v Speaker 3>almost felt like even though I knew I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was gonna vote,</v>

556
00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:35.260
<v Speaker 3>I almost felt like some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>spectator like this is this cannot</v>

557
00:25:35.361 --> 00:25:39.200
<v Speaker 3>possibly be real to speak to your</v>
<v Speaker 3>software simulation idea in the</v>

558
00:25:39.201 --> 00:25:40.760
<v Speaker 3>beginning that a lot of people share,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

559
00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:44.960
<v Speaker 3>it's not just crazy Scott Adams and me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of folks out there</v>

560
00:25:44.961 --> 00:25:46.580
<v Speaker 3>that think that we're living in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>simulation.</v>

561
00:25:46.581 --> 00:25:49.490
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as he would give these speeches,</v>

562
00:25:49.491 --> 00:25:53.070
<v Speaker 3>and there were some of his speeches he</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave where there was these moments where</v>

563
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.730
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone could tell that guy to keep</v>

564
00:25:55.731 --> 00:25:58.880
<v Speaker 3>it at seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where he's at right there and talk</v>

565
00:25:58.881 --> 00:26:01.760
<v Speaker 3>like that always and avoid all the crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

566
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.360
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crazy shit is what you get.</v>

567
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Like that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about people like trump</v>

568
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:14.230
<v Speaker 3>or like any powerful super dominator</v>
<v Speaker 3>type character like that.</v>

569
00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.570
<v Speaker 3>You'd have some flaws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them,</v>

570
00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.180
<v Speaker 3>the liquid,</v>

571
00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.030
<v Speaker 1>he kept saying all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was always saying he was the energy</v>

572
00:26:21.031 --> 00:26:21.800
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yesterday.</v>

573
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.270
<v Speaker 1>I look at my crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other one has no stamina.</v>

574
00:26:24.271 --> 00:26:25.104
<v Speaker 1>This one's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

575
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.410
<v Speaker 1>low energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

576
00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.870
<v Speaker 1>he knew the facts didn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew the policy didn't matter.</v>

577
00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.330
<v Speaker 1>And by the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody agrees they didn't</v>

578
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.700
<v Speaker 1>mean by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by election day.</v>

579
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot of people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

580
00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.530
<v Speaker 1>I sure like that tpp stand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing like that was happening.</v>

581
00:26:42.531 --> 00:26:43.364
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>

582
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.400
<v Speaker 2>no issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

583
00:26:45.401 --> 00:26:47.610
<v Speaker 2>it just came down to which one you</v>
<v Speaker 2>hated.</v>

584
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:48.420
<v Speaker 2>The more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

585
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.500
<v Speaker 2>there was one issue though that was real</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was amongst feminists,</v>

586
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.730
<v Speaker 2>there was amongst women who were willing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to exonerate hillary on all the weird</v>

587
00:26:56.731 --> 00:26:58.470
<v Speaker 2>shit that she had ever done involving</v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

588
00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the stuff that she had done</v>

589
00:27:00.421 --> 00:27:03.490
<v Speaker 2>involving deleted emails and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

590
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.950
<v Speaker 2>and I had heard people even say that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were giving her a hard time</v>

591
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.490
<v Speaker 2>because she's a woman on her health and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

592
00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:15.690
<v Speaker 2>you are out of your fucking mind if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that she's falling asleep when</v>

593
00:27:15.691 --> 00:27:17.940
<v Speaker 2>she standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is bad.</v>

594
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:21.180
<v Speaker 2>That is so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that was anyone close to me,</v>

595
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.800
<v Speaker 2>anyone close to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

596
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.110
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to get you healthy.</v>

597
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.920
<v Speaker 2>You're fuckIng blacking out while you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing up and it's not just.</v>

598
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Once she fell down once in 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a serious concussion and was fucked</v>

599
00:27:34.111 --> 00:27:37.740
<v Speaker 2>up for six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me as a person who's terrified of brain</v>

600
00:27:37.741 --> 00:27:39.510
<v Speaker 2>trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that freaks me the fuck out because I</v>

601
00:27:39.511 --> 00:27:44.130
<v Speaker 2>know the repercussions of brain trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the impulsiveness that it bestows</v>

602
00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:46.800
<v Speaker 2>upon people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a horrible curse that happens.</v>

603
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.940
<v Speaker 2>It's happened to a lot of people I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I knew there was this weird</v>

604
00:27:50.941 --> 00:27:53.700
<v Speaker 2>delusional thing where people didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to address the fact that our health</v>

605
00:27:53.701 --> 00:27:57.570
<v Speaker 2>is poor and then it was revealed that</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the wikileaks emails that she had</v>

606
00:27:57.571 --> 00:28:00.450
<v Speaker 2>suffered from some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a stroke,</v>

607
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:05.451
<v Speaker 2>but a seizure in 2015 like that's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking year ago what is happening,</v>

608
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:11.700
<v Speaker 2>but nobody wanted to talk about that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this strange air that she's</v>

609
00:28:11.701 --> 00:28:13.230
<v Speaker 2>not being treated fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

610
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:18.260
<v Speaker 2>here's treated fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is a person who deleted 30,000</v>

611
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.090
<v Speaker 2>emails after she got a subpoena.</v>

612
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:26.330
<v Speaker 2>She's an older rich white woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she was a 40 year old black guy and</v>

613
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.370
<v Speaker 2>she deleted 30,000 emails after</v>
<v Speaker 2>subpoena,</v>

614
00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:31.990
<v Speaker 2>they would just shoot you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would just come over here.</v>

615
00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:36.000
<v Speaker 2>They would kick down your fucking door</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cuff you and drag you off to a cage</v>

616
00:28:36.001 --> 00:28:39.260
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how weird is.</v>

617
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:40.980
<v Speaker 2>Am I right way here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on here?</v>

618
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:45.870
<v Speaker 2>How weird is it that we went through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>entire election cycle and so many people</v>

619
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:49.050
<v Speaker 2>like it wouldn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like me were saying,</v>

620
00:28:49.051 --> 00:28:53.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure she looks healthy enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's definitely not healthy now.</v>

621
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.040
<v Speaker 2>She of course metal the standards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>best presidents,</v>

622
00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:00.030
<v Speaker 2>but what to what person ever interviewed</v>
<v Speaker 2>her and said,</v>

623
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.650
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of questions about your</v>

624
00:29:01.651 --> 00:29:05.370
<v Speaker 2>health and so the question this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you look the american public in the</v>

625
00:29:05.371 --> 00:29:09.240
<v Speaker 2>eye and tell us there's no major health</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems that you haven't disclosed?</v>

626
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.850
<v Speaker 2>I would never ask her a question like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because I don't think she'd ever</v>

627
00:29:11.851 --> 00:29:14.940
<v Speaker 2>give you a real answer the same way with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fbi,</v>

628
00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.330
<v Speaker 2>but you could tell by the way she evaded</v>
<v Speaker 2>it whether she was.</v>

629
00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:21.270
<v Speaker 2>She's a wizard at that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's her shit.</v>

630
00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.300
<v Speaker 2>That's the shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That red cape with the bull just goes</v>

631
00:29:24.301 --> 00:29:25.860
<v Speaker 2>flying by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

632
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.850
<v Speaker 2>You could always tell a lie or light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Layers will say something like,</v>

633
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.190
<v Speaker 2>so if so if you said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scott,</v>

634
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.580
<v Speaker 2>have you ever had any major health</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems?</v>

635
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.200
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't met all the requirements of</v>

636
00:29:37.201 --> 00:29:38.360
<v Speaker 2>the presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

637
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:39.090
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

638
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking you a specific question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there not disclosed?</v>

639
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.360
<v Speaker 2>And then I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump hasn't disclosed any more</v>

640
00:29:46.361 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 2>than I've disclosed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a person who's hiding something.</v>

641
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise they look you right in the eye</v>

642
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.680
<v Speaker 2>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear I'm great.</v>

643
00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's good.</v>

644
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.390
<v Speaker 2>I promise you nothing's going to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>out lAter when I'm president.</v>

645
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.410
<v Speaker 2>You will not be disappointed in any way</v>
<v Speaker 2>because nobody can say that if they</v>

646
00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:04.690
<v Speaker 2>think they're going to get bitten in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass in a year and a half when they</v>

647
00:30:04.691 --> 00:30:07.240
<v Speaker 2>collapsed in the white house lawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

648
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.940
<v Speaker 2>my point was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is that if you,</v>

649
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.490
<v Speaker 2>if you anyway described her health</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>

650
00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.510
<v Speaker 2>that you would somehow be a sexist and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the idea of her gender and being</v>

651
00:30:16.511 --> 00:30:19.690
<v Speaker 2>the first female president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which obviously would be very historic,</v>

652
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge issue.</v>

653
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge honor that,</v>

654
00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.620
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a part of what they were votIng</v>

655
00:30:26.621 --> 00:30:28.030
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It became a part.</v>

656
00:30:28.031 --> 00:30:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Her gender became a part of what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were voting for.</v>

657
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.890
<v Speaker 2>And so that was an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you the,</v>

658
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.720
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the positive spin on the same topic.</v>

659
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:43.350
<v Speaker 2>Cnn polished 24,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pundit explanations of why trump won</v>

660
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:45.040
<v Speaker 2>unexpectedly.</v>

661
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Twenty four different theories about why</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't see coming in the top 24.</v>

662
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.020
<v Speaker 2>None of them were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a woman,</v>

663
00:30:53.021 --> 00:30:55.310
<v Speaker 2>so couldn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't get it.</v>

664
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Not in the top 24.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

665
00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:01.030
<v Speaker 2>So if we may pause for a moment from</v>
<v Speaker 2>piling on.</v>

666
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Ms dot clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to say that the whole breaking the</v>

667
00:31:04.931 --> 00:31:07.790
<v Speaker 2>glass ceiling thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she fucking did that.</v>

668
00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:12.010
<v Speaker 2>That's toast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no six year old born today who</v>

669
00:31:12.011 --> 00:31:15.250
<v Speaker 2>says women can't be president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not even in their worldview.</v>

670
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.140
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll find you five,</v>

671
00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:18.580
<v Speaker 2>six year olds and say it right to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

672
00:31:18.581 --> 00:31:20.200
<v Speaker 2>I'll bet not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get a bunch of them together.</v>

673
00:31:20.201 --> 00:31:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Can a to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get some boys together.</v>

674
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.390
<v Speaker 2>I give them candy high five them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can trick them.</v>

675
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.950
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can talk.</v>

676
00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Talk buys into anything for candy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

677
00:31:30.371 --> 00:31:31.204
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying though.</v>

678
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:34.000
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That she got as she won the popular</v>

679
00:31:34.001 --> 00:31:34.700
<v Speaker 2>vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

680
00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.310
<v Speaker 2>As far as current count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

681
00:31:36.311 --> 00:31:37.930
<v Speaker 2>But who are you seeing saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

682
00:31:37.931 --> 00:31:41.260
<v Speaker 2>if it was sexism that didn't get her</v>
<v Speaker 2>elected feminists,</v>

683
00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:42.520
<v Speaker 2>feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I know.</v>

684
00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually believe that.</v>

685
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.830
<v Speaker 2>And you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole spectrum of variables</v>

686
00:31:47.831 --> 00:31:51.400
<v Speaker 2>and if someone's thinking about if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hovering over a,</v>

687
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're looking at Gary Johnson and</v>

688
00:31:53.861 --> 00:31:54.790
<v Speaker 2>hillary clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that was.</v>

689
00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:56.980
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they'll never trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're one of those people,</v>

690
00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:57.450
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

691
00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:59.110
<v Speaker 2>one of these motherfuckers going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>my vote.</v>

692
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:00.820
<v Speaker 2>They might start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

693
00:32:00.821 --> 00:32:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I want a woman</v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

694
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.120
<v Speaker 2>That's absolutely a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard anybody say that?</v>

695
00:32:05.121 --> 00:32:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

696
00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.080
<v Speaker 2>And what dId they say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they friend of mine?</v>

697
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:10.600
<v Speaker 2>A yoga instructor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as a woman,</v>

698
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.860
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitches are crazy.</v>

699
00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't want a woman running this</v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

700
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.390
<v Speaker 2>That's for real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real statement.</v>

701
00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:20.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a human being who was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to me and we're friends and no</v>

702
00:32:20.291 --> 00:32:23.260
<v Speaker 2>one was around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do you think that she would vote on</v>

703
00:32:23.261 --> 00:32:24.094
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

704
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.530
<v Speaker 2>I think there's many people that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote on that,</v>

705
00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.750
<v Speaker 2>but there's many people that will like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this man.</v>

706
00:32:28.751 --> 00:32:31.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what hillary did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if hillary's got a bunch of</v>

707
00:32:31.151 --> 00:32:33.580
<v Speaker 2>rape victims buried in her backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a woman.</v>

708
00:32:33.581 --> 00:32:36.790
<v Speaker 2>She represents women and probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>donald's got more.</v>

709
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:38.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that attitude too.</v>

710
00:32:38.741 --> 00:32:42.320
<v Speaker 2>There's a of people that would only vote</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a woman if given the chance.</v>

711
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Other know how you'd net it down because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a net positive.</v>

712
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Three hundred million people in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>country plus mexicans.</v>

713
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you really can net it down</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

714
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.070
<v Speaker 2>I just think there's too many of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

715
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.380
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the things that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned from this really important</v>

716
00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:01.220
<v Speaker 2>lesson when it comes to polls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not real anymore.</v>

717
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:03.560
<v Speaker 2>They're not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not talking to me.</v>

718
00:33:03.561 --> 00:33:04.760
<v Speaker 2>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not answering polls.</v>

719
00:33:04.761 --> 00:33:06.810
<v Speaker 2>Jamie doesn't answer a goddamn pole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at them.</v>

720
00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:08.360
<v Speaker 2>So no one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one,</v>

721
00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:09.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>answers poles.</v>

722
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:14.120
<v Speaker 2>It's a such a small sampling of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the people that answer polls,</v>

723
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:17.090
<v Speaker 2>they don't have anything better to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>than answer a fucking pole.</v>

724
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.850
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not good as the jury duty</v>

725
00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:21.830
<v Speaker 2>product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactLy what the problem is.</v>

726
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:26.630
<v Speaker 2>So I think we learned that definitively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These polls do not work well.</v>

727
00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.870
<v Speaker 2>If I could defend a native silver for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment was okay.</v>

728
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does 5:38 to a website.</v>

729
00:33:33.381 --> 00:33:37.550
<v Speaker 2>The best best statistician on politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's not his fault?</v>

730
00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.650
<v Speaker 2>He's worked with the data he has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

731
00:33:39.651 --> 00:33:41.980
<v Speaker 2>but he was also within two percent I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think wasn't.</v>

732
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

733
00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:44.150
<v Speaker 2>so at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

734
00:33:44.151 --> 00:33:46.070
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always converge toward the end,</v>

735
00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started out wIldly ridiculous and</v>

736
00:33:48.891 --> 00:33:51.350
<v Speaker 2>then when it's clear that it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be one way or the other,</v>

737
00:33:51.351 --> 00:33:53.690
<v Speaker 2>all the polls are coming toward the end</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they want to say,</v>

738
00:33:53.691 --> 00:33:54.210
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they hadn't,</v>

739
00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.420
<v Speaker 2>that was only two percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well jamie and I were watching this</v>

740
00:33:56.421 --> 00:34:00.200
<v Speaker 2>video clip of the young turks calling</v>
<v Speaker 2>down the election yesterday and at the</v>

741
00:34:00.201 --> 00:34:04.040
<v Speaker 2>beginning of it they were 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced that hillary could not lose.</v>

742
00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:05.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this one guy was saying,</v>

743
00:34:05.721 --> 00:34:07.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hillary can't lose.</v>

744
00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.880
<v Speaker 2>She like literally it's mathematically</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then by the end they were fucking</v>

745
00:34:10.881 --> 00:34:12.650
<v Speaker 2>screaming and swearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

746
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.280
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these numbers that people like count on</v>

747
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:18.830
<v Speaker 2>like 84 percent say this 15 percent.</v>

748
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.940
<v Speaker 2>Try to Imagine my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know this,</v>

749
00:34:22.941 --> 00:34:25.580
<v Speaker 2>but a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than a year ago,</v>

750
00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:30.910
<v Speaker 2>I predicted that trump would win with 98</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent certainty in a landslide win at</v>

751
00:34:31.011 --> 00:34:34.010
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the few people who said it</v>

752
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.590
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is because of the way he was so</v>

753
00:34:36.591 --> 00:34:37.350
<v Speaker 2>persuasive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

754
00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Just based on his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his talents.</v>

755
00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this was pre the rosie o'donnell</v>

756
00:34:41.181 --> 00:34:43.220
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was a year ago,</v>

757
00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:47.750
<v Speaker 2>I think it was over the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like august last year,</v>

758
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.060
<v Speaker 2>the first debates where I think yOu're</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

759
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:51.680
<v Speaker 2>but that wasn't a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

760
00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:52.700
<v Speaker 2>There was a little bit more than a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

761
00:34:52.701 --> 00:34:53.990
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're splitting harrison.</v>

762
00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

763
00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:58.380
<v Speaker 2>so back then when I predicted it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

764
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:03.200
<v Speaker 2>you can imagine the heat I took because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was such an unlikely pick and how</v>

765
00:35:03.201 --> 00:35:08.201
<v Speaker 2>many people just wanting to dance on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>grave for be enrolling and the angry at</v>

766
00:35:08.271 --> 00:35:09.920
<v Speaker 2>you and angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

767
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Going to be going over to amazon and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>me a bad book reviews because they</v>

768
00:35:14.331 --> 00:35:15.740
<v Speaker 2>didn't like what I said about Donald</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump.</v>

769
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:22.900
<v Speaker 2>So that moment when I found out that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't wasted my whole year because it</v>

770
00:35:25.101 --> 00:35:27.920
<v Speaker 2>would have been a terrible year to be so</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong for a year,</v>

771
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:30.010
<v Speaker 2>and then there's like no pay off</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>

772
00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.020
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like the worst gamble ever.</v>

773
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Bad risk management.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

774
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 2>but then to have it come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come through just the way</v>

775
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I predicted it was this amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing moment.</v>

776
00:35:41.881 --> 00:35:43.410
<v Speaker 1>You only get a few of those in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

777
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did really lend win by a landslide.</v>

778
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.910
<v Speaker 1>So that you were off by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an electoral landslide.</v>

779
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electoral.</v>

780
00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>

781
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Electorally one by quite a few points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

782
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.970
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty close up until how many</v>

783
00:35:56.971 --> 00:35:59.670
<v Speaker 1>hours in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you started,</v>

784
00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:00.990
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>

785
00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:01.923
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

786
00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:04.120
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing that I think it's</v>

787
00:36:04.121 --> 00:36:07.120
<v Speaker 3>important to make a distinction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is what I recognize.</v>

788
00:36:07.121 --> 00:36:10.810
<v Speaker 3>I knew when I watched some of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>periscopes and when you just weren't</v>

789
00:36:10.811 --> 00:36:13.780
<v Speaker 3>making a moral judgment of him as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

790
00:36:13.781 --> 00:36:17.650
<v Speaker 3>and that's what people expected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People expected a line in the sand to be</v>

791
00:36:17.651 --> 00:36:21.760
<v Speaker 3>drawn morally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you were doing was talking about</v>

792
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.450
<v Speaker 3>all of his traits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you compounding all of his positive</v>

793
00:36:25.451 --> 00:36:30.451
<v Speaker 3>traits and what he what he does well and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then people got mad at you for bringing</v>

794
00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:33.970
<v Speaker 3>your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're analyzing it like say if you're a</v>

795
00:36:33.971 --> 00:36:37.350
<v Speaker 3>scientist and you take up a plant that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find in the amazon,</v>

796
00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:37.721
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

797
00:36:37.721 --> 00:36:40.180
<v Speaker 3>what is this plant consists of?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's break down the parts?</v>

798
00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.230
<v Speaker 3>You were kind of breaking down the parts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what he does and where what is</v>

799
00:36:44.231 --> 00:36:46.630
<v Speaker 3>effective and it didn't seem to me.</v>

800
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't seem like a guy who was</v>

801
00:36:48.421 --> 00:36:48.730
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

802
00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:52.630
<v Speaker 3>there's a few guys out there that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>like rabid rah rah trump supporters and</v>

803
00:36:52.631 --> 00:36:56.140
<v Speaker 3>some of them were at super transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a few guys out there that I'm</v>

804
00:36:56.141 --> 00:36:57.850
<v Speaker 3>watching them and I know what they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

805
00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.280
<v Speaker 3>What they're doing is they're latching</v>
<v Speaker 3>onto the trump train,</v>

806
00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.570
<v Speaker 3>the latching on like really shamelessly</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they try.</v>

807
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:07.480
<v Speaker 3>They tweet about trump all the time now</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they never give a fuck about him.</v>

808
00:37:07.481 --> 00:37:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Awhile ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like over the last six months,</v>

809
00:37:09.971 --> 00:37:12.640
<v Speaker 3>they've jumped on this because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize there's a tremendous amount of</v>

810
00:37:12.641 --> 00:37:16.750
<v Speaker 3>loyalty and momentum behind being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump supporter and a fan because it's a</v>

811
00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:20.320
<v Speaker 3>tough stance to take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So guys that are already marginalized or</v>

812
00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:23.710
<v Speaker 3>already kind of like fringe and people</v>
<v Speaker 3>think they're kinda maybe creepy.</v>

813
00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:24.581
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck this,</v>

814
00:37:24.581 --> 00:37:27.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to full cream and they jump</v>
<v Speaker 3>right in and it's kinda,</v>

815
00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.260
<v Speaker 3>it's real transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

816
00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously that's just my take on it.</v>

817
00:37:31.241 --> 00:37:34.660
<v Speaker 3>They might actually be really trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>supporters and they're super excited,</v>

818
00:37:34.661 --> 00:37:37.540
<v Speaker 3>but I sent some disingenuous behavior</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there.</v>

819
00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.240
<v Speaker 3>Careful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>careful trump train.</v>

820
00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.850
<v Speaker 3>He might have some hobos on your fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>wagons.</v>

821
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I think what's different about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>election and about trump in particular</v>

822
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:50.830
<v Speaker 1>is that it used to be we're electing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>leader,</v>

823
00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.350
<v Speaker 1>someone who would be a role model and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

824
00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:57.310
<v Speaker 1>I think he threw that all out the door</v>
<v Speaker 1>and social media throws even moral</v>

825
00:37:57.311 --> 00:38:00.700
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean is I think the public is the</v>

826
00:38:00.701 --> 00:38:02.080
<v Speaker 1>leader knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

827
00:38:02.081 --> 00:38:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I think no laws get passed that less</v>
<v Speaker 1>than majority of the public wants it to</v>

828
00:38:05.711 --> 00:38:08.170
<v Speaker 1>get past anything that gets a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>adeline.</v>

829
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Social media just throws it back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

830
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:15.190
<v Speaker 1>And more than ever I think we hired an</v>
<v Speaker 1>employee rather than a leader.</v>

831
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.830
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I hired a plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

832
00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.130
<v Speaker 1>someone who's just really good at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific set of skills,</v>

833
00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:22.900
<v Speaker 1>negotiating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

834
00:38:22.901 --> 00:38:25.040
<v Speaker 1>maybe doing something with a budget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it needs to be done,</v>

835
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:29.170
<v Speaker 1>secure the borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's sort of like picking a lawyer.</v>

836
00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what he's doing in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal life.</v>

837
00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:34.630
<v Speaker 1>He's not my role model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

838
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:39.070
<v Speaker 1>which of our kids are looking to 70 year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old men as their role models anyway.</v>

839
00:38:39.071 --> 00:38:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that happens a lot</v>

840
00:38:40.661 --> 00:38:43.810
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I think he really is going</v>

841
00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:48.811
<v Speaker 1>to be the first sort of people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>president you see as policies changing</v>

842
00:38:48.911 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 1>in real time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the example we talked about earlier</v>

843
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.590
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

844
00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:54.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>

845
00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.450
<v Speaker 1>he misspoke and he said women should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>punished if they get an illegal</v>

846
00:38:58.451 --> 00:39:00.820
<v Speaker 1>abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that the law and both</v>

847
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:04.690
<v Speaker 1>republicans and democrats think that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy because it would discourage,</v>

848
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:06.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who didn't encourage the wrong behavior</v>

849
00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:11.440
<v Speaker 1>and so only the doctor is punished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you saw him change his opinion in 24</v>

850
00:39:11.441 --> 00:39:15.490
<v Speaker 1>hours just by being a little more</v>
<v Speaker 1>informed and hearing that the public was</v>

851
00:39:15.491 --> 00:39:18.130
<v Speaker 1>all on the same side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's interesting.</v>

852
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.090
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll beNd with the breeze in and I kind</v>

853
00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:25.810
<v Speaker 1>of flip flopping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Common political term is in the</v>

854
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.160
<v Speaker 1>political realm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be flip flopping and you know,</v>

855
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.480
<v Speaker 1>he has no moral backbone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're saying it's receptive to the</v>

856
00:39:31.481 --> 00:39:34.240
<v Speaker 1>public's desires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a businessperson in the business</v>

857
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:38.680
<v Speaker 1>realm is more like ab testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you're rapidly testing things.</v>

858
00:39:38.681 --> 00:39:41.320
<v Speaker 1>You see what the response is and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjust if you don't get the right,</v>

859
00:39:41.321 --> 00:39:44.530
<v Speaker 1>but that's also like one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticisms of him is that he talks off</v>

860
00:39:44.531 --> 00:39:47.470
<v Speaker 1>the cuff without really having</v>
<v Speaker 1>researched or thought deeply about these</v>

861
00:39:47.471 --> 00:39:49.090
<v Speaker 1>subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're talking about a guy</v>

862
00:39:49.091 --> 00:39:52.510
<v Speaker 1>who's supposed to be the leader of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest country in the world's ever</v>

863
00:39:52.511 --> 00:39:53.344
<v Speaker 1>known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

864
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.980
<v Speaker 1>that guy should probably not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put,</v>

865
00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:57.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put a different filter on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

866
00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the persuasion filter,</v>

867
00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:05.440
<v Speaker 1>since facts and logic and policies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff don't matter as much as you want.</v>

868
00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:08.680
<v Speaker 1>When you See him ignoring things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just think,</v>

869
00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:11.230
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reasonable person would not say that a</v>

870
00:40:11.231 --> 00:40:15.220
<v Speaker 1>reasonable person would not ignore that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ignores things because they don't</v>

871
00:40:15.221 --> 00:40:17.860
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think he's ignoring something very</v>

872
00:40:17.861 --> 00:40:21.850
<v Speaker 1>important and he would perform better if</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did what you imagine is the right way</v>

873
00:40:21.851 --> 00:40:23.620
<v Speaker 1>to act?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so,</v>

874
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.400
<v Speaker 1>but you don't think it's important to</v>
<v Speaker 1>not arrest women who get illegal</v>

875
00:40:27.401 --> 00:40:29.350
<v Speaker 1>abortions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

876
00:40:29.351 --> 00:40:31.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know what I'm saying?</v>

877
00:40:31.031 --> 00:40:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Like that's an important thing to pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to,</v>

878
00:40:32.951 --> 00:40:34.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have an opinion on it.</v>

879
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying,</v>

880
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:38.890
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying is that the things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would need to know to be a president.</v>

881
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's say,</v>

882
00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:42.610
<v Speaker 1>let's say hillary clinton knows them</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

883
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Let's let's say she's attended attended</v>
<v Speaker 1>of just knowledge.</v>

884
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.660
<v Speaker 1>if he's a six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which probably is a generous,</v>

885
00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:52.360
<v Speaker 1>there probably isn't any decision that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he won't have.</v>

886
00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Advisors were filling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say they becomes an informed as he needs</v>

887
00:40:56.051 --> 00:40:58.510
<v Speaker 1>to know exactly the way a ceo would run</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

888
00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is not really related to that</v>

889
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:02.130
<v Speaker 1>one particular subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

890
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.330
<v Speaker 1>that was just an example of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand what You're saying is</v>

891
00:41:04.331 --> 00:41:06.460
<v Speaker 1>changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he became more Informed,</v>

892
00:41:06.461 --> 00:41:08.140
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't stick to an old opinion.</v>

893
00:41:08.141 --> 00:41:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Even as the facts change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this has done the same thing with</v>

894
00:41:11.171 --> 00:41:12.330
<v Speaker 1>obamacare as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

895
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Met with obama and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

896
00:41:13.841 --> 00:41:16.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's some things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>obamacare that we might want to keep.</v>

897
00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:20.380
<v Speaker 1>So what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call pacIng and leading in the.</v>

898
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:25.650
<v Speaker 1>In the hypnosis I the bullshitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

899
00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.900
<v Speaker 1>and here's how it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he does is he agrees with people</v>

900
00:41:28.901 --> 00:41:31.570
<v Speaker 1>emotionally first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets you on your side emotionally.</v>

901
00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.770
<v Speaker 1>So if you're really concerned about</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>

902
00:41:33.771 --> 00:41:35.570
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't just say,</v>

903
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.000
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

904
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned about that too.</v>

905
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.800
<v Speaker 1>That would be sort of a hillary clinton</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach.</v>

906
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Being less concerned that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

907
00:41:42.171 --> 00:41:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I got other priorities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's way more concerned than you are if</v>

908
00:41:45.261 --> 00:41:48.230
<v Speaker 1>you're a little bit worried about</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration and he's worried about,</v>

909
00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:50.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isis coming over here and putting people</v>

910
00:41:50.061 --> 00:41:52.250
<v Speaker 1>in cages and cutting off heads and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>

911
00:41:52.251 --> 00:41:57.251
<v Speaker 1>there's a hordes coming over the border,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's so on your side that when he</v>

912
00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:01.340
<v Speaker 1>changes toward the middle and you knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had to because you have to do that</v>

913
00:42:01.341 --> 00:42:05.060
<v Speaker 1>when you get in the general election</v>
<v Speaker 1>that his side was not feeling betrayed</v>

914
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:06.320
<v Speaker 1>because they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

915
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.380
<v Speaker 1>if he's changing the specifics of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy,</v>

916
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:13.580
<v Speaker 1>it must be because he looked into it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's interesting.</v>

917
00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:16.580
<v Speaker 1>that's what's practical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're willing to go with him if</v>

918
00:42:16.581 --> 00:42:18.920
<v Speaker 1>they feel that he's on their side</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally,</v>

919
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:23.000
<v Speaker 1>so he always sides with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally goes as big as possible.</v>

920
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Uses hyperbole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says he does that and it gives them</v>

921
00:42:26.481 --> 00:42:29.360
<v Speaker 1>also gives them room to negotiate back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the middle and everybody says,</v>

922
00:42:29.361 --> 00:42:31.280
<v Speaker 1>my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy now you're negotiated back to</v>

923
00:42:31.281 --> 00:42:32.114
<v Speaker 1>the middle.</v>

924
00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.460
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

925
00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.490
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why do I feel like just getting</v>

926
00:42:37.491 --> 00:42:40.400
<v Speaker 2>lucky?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's really shitty</v>

927
00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:43.610
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary clinton is a terrible example of</v>

928
00:42:43.611 --> 00:42:46.700
<v Speaker 2>someone who should be running the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country in so many ways and she beat him</v>

929
00:42:46.701 --> 00:42:49.160
<v Speaker 2>in the popular vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

930
00:42:49.161 --> 00:42:51.140
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got a lot of dirt on.</v>

931
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:54.200
<v Speaker 2>So she beat him in the contest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't having the result.</v>

932
00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.090
<v Speaker 2>That was the only one contest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

933
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:57.590
<v Speaker 2>And he won that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

934
00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.590
<v Speaker 2>What's hilarious is in 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was saying it was a rigged system</v>

935
00:43:00.591 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 2>because of that contest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

936
00:43:02.721 --> 00:43:05.810
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about the popular vote</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

937
00:43:05.811 --> 00:43:06.630
<v Speaker 2>how it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it?</v>

938
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:07.190
<v Speaker 2>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

939
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:08.660
<v Speaker 2>what year was it where it went to al</v>
<v Speaker 2>gore?</v>

940
00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.630
<v Speaker 2>What year was it where al gore won the</v>
<v Speaker 2>popular vote,</v>

941
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.640
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it did carry when.</v>

942
00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kerry number one the popular road.</v>

943
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just al gore.</v>

944
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Al gore won the popular vote against</v>
<v Speaker 2>bush,</v>

945
00:43:18.541 --> 00:43:19.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

946
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:20.630
<v Speaker 2>By like a half a million.</v>

947
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every year there's going to be this</v>

948
00:43:24.121 --> 00:43:26.450
<v Speaker 1>conversation anytime the voter's rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>

949
00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you see is that</v>

950
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:33.300
<v Speaker 1>trump doesn't care about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

951
00:43:33.301 --> 00:43:36.750
<v Speaker 1>the consistency or what somebody would</v>
<v Speaker 1>say is being a hypocrite.</v>

952
00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:42.000
<v Speaker 1>I've tweeted this recently that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>least persuasive thing you could ever</v>

953
00:43:42.001 --> 00:43:44.010
<v Speaker 1>say in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to change somebody's</v>

954
00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:47.910
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that person's a hypocrite in all,</v>

955
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.370
<v Speaker 1>in all of history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's never changed anybody's mind.</v>

956
00:43:50.371 --> 00:43:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

957
00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:54.050
<v Speaker 1>slap my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really realize that bottoms up.</v>

958
00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.600
<v Speaker 1>You mean about a politician by</v>
<v Speaker 1>politician?</v>

959
00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

960
00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:01.890
<v Speaker 1>we accept a certain amount of bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we also accept that they used to say</v>

961
00:44:01.891 --> 00:44:04.500
<v Speaker 1>one thing and now they say another and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just seems so normal.</v>

962
00:44:04.501 --> 00:44:07.830
<v Speaker 1>It's in the baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that the being the</v>

963
00:44:07.831 --> 00:44:10.830
<v Speaker 1>president is an impossible job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>

964
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:12.840
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't seem like anybody could</v>
<v Speaker 1>really do it.</v>

965
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:17.940
<v Speaker 1>It's both impossible and the easiest job</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sense that the office of the</v>

966
00:44:17.941 --> 00:44:22.020
<v Speaker 1>president and all the advisors and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the public opinion is going to force you</v>

967
00:44:22.021 --> 00:44:26.190
<v Speaker 1>down to just a few possible options and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two options will,</v>

968
00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.740
<v Speaker 1>you will not have enough information to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know which one's better.</v>

969
00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:30.450
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyone,</v>

970
00:44:30.451 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 1>anybody among the last two options that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've narrowed it down to,</v>

971
00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.830
<v Speaker 1>there's a little bit of luck involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to say now.</v>

972
00:44:37.831 --> 00:44:39.570
<v Speaker 1>So what do you mean by this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>WeLl,</v>

973
00:44:39.571 --> 00:44:42.450
<v Speaker 1>you have to match the personality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

974
00:44:42.451 --> 00:44:44.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could have a,</v>

975
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:48.970
<v Speaker 1>a president who is just terrific in</v>
<v Speaker 1>wartime but weren't much good at</v>

976
00:44:48.971 --> 00:44:50.580
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'd be,</v>

977
00:44:50.581 --> 00:44:51.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next thing you know,</v>

978
00:44:51.691 --> 00:44:56.691
<v Speaker 1>they're on mount rushmore because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you have obama whose primary job was</v>

979
00:44:56.971 --> 00:45:01.971
<v Speaker 1>winding down to ors and basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaning up and bass and keeping us from</v>

980
00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:04.530
<v Speaker 1>a larger product problem.</v>

981
00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:06.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economy melting down.</v>

982
00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:10.890
<v Speaker 1>So obama is really the presidency of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things he prevented that could have been</v>

983
00:45:10.891 --> 00:45:13.800
<v Speaker 1>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would put them in the top 20</v>

984
00:45:13.801 --> 00:45:17.670
<v Speaker 1>percent of presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my view of him is very positive and I</v>

985
00:45:17.671 --> 00:45:22.671
<v Speaker 1>think even obamacare is a genius</v>
<v Speaker 1>persuasive move even in its failure</v>

986
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.010
<v Speaker 1>because he set it up that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said that publicly.</v>

987
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.040
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to launch it ugly.</v>

988
00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm paraphrasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't get exactly what I wanted in this</v>

989
00:45:32.671 --> 00:45:34.410
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once it's out there,</v>

990
00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:38.340
<v Speaker 1>it will be impossible for politicians to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull back coverage.</v>

991
00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:41.370
<v Speaker 1>They'll just have to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where are we today?</v>

992
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's saying obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>total failure without obamacare because</v>

993
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:50.570
<v Speaker 1>we're going to keep the good parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keywords keep the good parts exactly as</v>

994
00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:54.810
<v Speaker 1>he fucking plan and said so publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it,</v>

995
00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:56.820
<v Speaker 1>he said it publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

996
00:45:56.821 --> 00:45:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

997
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:01.170
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to have to fix it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's going to be the only choice</v>

998
00:46:01.171 --> 00:46:02.310
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what,</v>

999
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.170
<v Speaker 1>that's what trump's gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna fix it.</v>

1000
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:09.950
<v Speaker 1>So what is he going to fix?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably he's going to keep the main</v>

1001
00:46:10.051 --> 00:46:14.820
<v Speaker 1>parts and probably shift some money</v>
<v Speaker 1>around from something,</v>

1002
00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:15.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1003
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that fix looks like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>miracle fix.</v>

1004
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't knoW that that's in our future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm.</v>

1005
00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm no expert on obamacare.</v>

1006
00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this weird thing that we've done</v>

1007
00:46:26.061 --> 00:46:27.540
<v Speaker 3>now with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1008
00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.080
<v Speaker 3>with trump that I've never seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've,</v>

1009
00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:34.940
<v Speaker 3>we've narrowed them down to chance and</v>
<v Speaker 3>slogans like I talked to in this podcast</v>

1010
00:46:34.941 --> 00:46:39.710
<v Speaker 3>about I was in New York city at the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the protests because I was there for</v>

1011
00:46:39.711 --> 00:46:42.350
<v Speaker 3>the ufc and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were walking from the gym to the</v>

1012
00:46:42.351 --> 00:46:47.060
<v Speaker 3>hotel and we just got caught in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>wave of people screaming with really</v>

1013
00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.360
<v Speaker 3>fucking crazy science man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't a whole lot of love and</v>

1014
00:46:50.361 --> 00:46:54.180
<v Speaker 3>compassion on their signs that we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about this before the podcast</v>

1015
00:46:54.181 --> 00:46:56.180
<v Speaker 3>started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the left has become something very</v>

1016
00:46:56.181 --> 00:46:58.820
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this really aggressive,</v>

1017
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:03.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insulting shaming and even the call for</v>

1018
00:47:03.411 --> 00:47:05.630
<v Speaker 3>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's people with rape melania</v>

1019
00:47:05.631 --> 00:47:06.860
<v Speaker 3>signs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1020
00:47:06.861 --> 00:47:07.820
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1021
00:47:07.821 --> 00:47:10.970
<v Speaker 3>there's pictures of him online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the big question is,</v>

1022
00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:13.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have one foot in the,</v>

1023
00:47:13.091 --> 00:47:15.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alt right world because I sample</v>

1024
00:47:15.581 --> 00:47:18.310
<v Speaker 1>everything over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm also watching cnn and regular</v>

1025
00:47:18.311 --> 00:47:22.390
<v Speaker 1>media and these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these folks live in completely different</v>

1026
00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:26.650
<v Speaker 1>realities because they have different</v>
<v Speaker 1>inforMation because they're looking at</v>

1027
00:47:26.651 --> 00:47:30.220
<v Speaker 1>different sources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So within the conservative of things,</v>

1028
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.370
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is understood universally understood</v>

1029
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:37.090
<v Speaker 1>that the protesters are professional and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're paid by soros.</v>

1030
00:47:37.091 --> 00:47:38.320
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying this,</v>

1031
00:47:38.321 --> 00:47:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying what their view is on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other side,</v>

1032
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.060
<v Speaker 1>people think it's a true grassroots</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

1033
00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the view is completely two</v>

1034
00:47:47.141 --> 00:47:47.950
<v Speaker 1>different worlds.</v>

1035
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:50.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there may very well be some people that</v>

1036
00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:53.830
<v Speaker 3>have been paid to protest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is absolutely a bunch of</v>

1037
00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:55.720
<v Speaker 3>people that are protesting because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're upset.</v>

1038
00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:00.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be fluffed up a little bit,</v>

1039
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's definitely people that are</v>

1040
00:48:02.231 --> 00:48:04.870
<v Speaker 3>just young people that are pissed off or</v>
<v Speaker 3>old people that are pissed off.</v>

1041
00:48:04.871 --> 00:48:08.590
<v Speaker 3>There's people that are just upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question was whether the protests</v>

1042
00:48:08.591 --> 00:48:12.880
<v Speaker 3>would have lasted in spread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And ben as well organized protest.</v>

1043
00:48:12.881 --> 00:48:14.260
<v Speaker 3>Scott adams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>

1044
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:16.780
<v Speaker 3>You feel like you're doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're blocking wilshire.</v>

1045
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.710
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1046
00:48:18.711 --> 00:48:20.020
<v Speaker 3>And this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1047
00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:24.070
<v Speaker 3>what I was saying about it boiled down</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a slogan like,</v>

1048
00:48:24.071 --> 00:48:26.440
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not my fucking president,</v>

1049
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that kind of shit like Donald</v>

1050
00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:29.271
<v Speaker 3>Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>k,</v>

1051
00:48:29.271 --> 00:48:30.104
<v Speaker 3>k,</v>
<v Speaker 3>k.</v>

1052
00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:34.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like they want to like yell out</v>
<v Speaker 3>things they associate with him,</v>

1053
00:48:34.751 --> 00:48:37.120
<v Speaker 3>which I've never seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's about a president.</v>

1054
00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.480
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I write about this extensively.</v>

1055
00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:43.170
<v Speaker 1>So the best persuasion is fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1056
00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:46.560
<v Speaker 1>So in the beginning of the election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump had the best persuasion because he</v>

1057
00:48:46.561 --> 00:48:48.600
<v Speaker 1>was saying the terrorists are coming in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1058
00:48:48.601 --> 00:48:50.250
<v Speaker 1>I'll stop them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's criminals,</v>

1059
00:48:50.251 --> 00:48:54.030
<v Speaker 1>criminal cross the border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton was talking boring policies and</v>

1060
00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:55.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced.</v>

1061
00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.060
<v Speaker 1>So she didn't have a chance against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1062
00:48:57.061 --> 00:49:01.770
<v Speaker 1>you're going to die tomorrow by summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She obviously had some professional</v>

1063
00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.620
<v Speaker 1>help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning somebody who's a cognitive</v>

1064
00:49:04.621 --> 00:49:09.621
<v Speaker 1>scientist or a professional persuader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she started using the term dark all</v>

1065
00:49:09.631 --> 00:49:12.090
<v Speaker 1>the time and all the surrogates used it</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>

1066
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:13.081
<v Speaker 1>It's dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>

1067
00:49:13.081 --> 00:49:17.160
<v Speaker 1>dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she started coloring him as a huge</v>

1068
00:49:17.161 --> 00:49:19.430
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dictators.</v>

1069
00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous to the world and the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous thing in the world.</v>

1070
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're worried about</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism,</v>

1071
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:28.140
<v Speaker 1>you're really worried about somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else getting killed because you're not</v>

1072
00:49:28.141 --> 00:49:30.120
<v Speaker 1>really thinking you get killed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorists.</v>

1073
00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:31.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's pretty bad,</v>

1074
00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:36.420
<v Speaker 1>somebody else's getting killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But clinton painted a picture to make</v>

1075
00:49:36.421 --> 00:49:37.950
<v Speaker 1>you afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1076
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:38.721
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1077
00:49:38.721 --> 00:49:43.721
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear holocaust created by trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeting something at 3:00 AM and I</v>

1078
00:49:44.051 --> 00:49:45.450
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting the button accidentally.</v>

1079
00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:49.170
<v Speaker 1>And so that was the ultimate fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she really had that going.</v>

1080
00:49:49.171 --> 00:49:50.004
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1081
00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:55.370
<v Speaker 1>and when she lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had all these people activated who</v>

1082
00:49:56.071 --> 00:49:59.490
<v Speaker 1>would've been instantly deactivated if</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump had lost,</v>

1083
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:02.250
<v Speaker 1>but there's no deactivation on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>

1084
00:50:02.251 --> 00:50:07.251
<v Speaker 1>Now she created this society societal</v>
<v Speaker 1>bomb that is these protests in the way</v>

1085
00:50:07.951 --> 00:50:11.760
<v Speaker 1>people feel they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people literally believe that</v>

1086
00:50:11.761 --> 00:50:13.340
<v Speaker 1>hitler was just elected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1087
00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.560
<v Speaker 1>a version of hitler who will will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I saw,</v>

1088
00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:21.580
<v Speaker 1>I actually saw today journalists talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about concentration camps and that sort</v>

1089
00:50:22.861 --> 00:50:25.980
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe nothing even remotely like,</v>

1090
00:50:25.981 --> 00:50:30.190
<v Speaker 1>that's going to happen or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I would obviously be on,</v>

1091
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:35.260
<v Speaker 1>on the side of the protestors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not their view of the world.</v>

1092
00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Is that the trump supporters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1093
00:50:38.091 --> 00:50:40.610
<v Speaker 1>he's a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they installed them because they</v>

1094
00:50:40.611 --> 00:50:44.870
<v Speaker 1>want them to go do racist things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump supporters know that even within</v>

1095
00:50:44.871 --> 00:50:47.460
<v Speaker 1>the ranks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like two percent people are our</v>

1096
00:50:47.461 --> 00:50:49.760
<v Speaker 1>actual races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've never met one,</v>

1097
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:52.460
<v Speaker 1>like the hardcore guide and I'd never</v>
<v Speaker 1>even met one.</v>

1098
00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:56.220
<v Speaker 3>I bet we can introduce you to some</v>
<v Speaker 3>people if we just asked around.</v>

1099
00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:01.200
<v Speaker 3>I think it wouldn't be hard to find one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the boat and had a very funny line.</v>

1100
00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:03.390
<v Speaker 3>He said not all trump supporters are</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>

1101
00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.670
<v Speaker 3>but all racists or trump's</v>

1102
00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.160
<v Speaker 1>porters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

1103
00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:10.330
<v Speaker 1>so what we have here is a situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the racists are living in their</v>

1104
00:51:10.331 --> 00:51:13.660
<v Speaker 1>own little world and they think they</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually got their guy.</v>

1105
00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Most trump supporters just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1106
00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:18.340
<v Speaker 1>less taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1107
00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.490
<v Speaker 1>that they're thinking they like his</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality though,</v>

1108
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:25.290
<v Speaker 1>just like something about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the clinton supporters think that</v>

1109
00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:28.090
<v Speaker 1>hitler actually got elected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're acting on that.</v>

1110
00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:30.790
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what's happened is that clinton</v>

1111
00:51:30.791 --> 00:51:33.370
<v Speaker 1>has somewhat accidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she thought she was going to</v>

1112
00:51:33.371 --> 00:51:35.200
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at which point this whole problem goes</v>

1113
00:51:35.201 --> 00:51:36.490
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1114
00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:41.290
<v Speaker 1>somewhat accidentally created this</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic societal bomb that there's no</v>

1115
00:51:41.291 --> 00:51:44.920
<v Speaker 1>way to diffuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a number of people including me are</v>

1116
00:51:44.921 --> 00:51:48.190
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to literally d hypnotize people</v>

1117
00:51:48.191 --> 00:51:51.760
<v Speaker 1>who were in this illusion that the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>war three just started.</v>

1118
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1119
00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:56.930
<v Speaker 3>it was very disturbing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>

1120
00:51:56.931 --> 00:52:01.931
<v Speaker 3>one of the big ones was when she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>confronted about the dnc hack and uh,</v>

1121
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:06.470
<v Speaker 3>her emails and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hacked emails from our server where</v>

1122
00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:11.810
<v Speaker 3>she diverted attention by saying that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was Russia that did this and that there</v>

1123
00:52:11.811 --> 00:52:14.300
<v Speaker 3>would be repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And tHen she said,</v>

1124
00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:19.540
<v Speaker 3>even possibly militarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's the worst diffusion of</v>

1125
00:52:20.421 --> 00:52:24.020
<v Speaker 3>responsibility ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you were talking about you deleting</v>

1126
00:52:24.021 --> 00:52:29.021
<v Speaker 3>emails after a subpoena and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>argument is that the russians got those</v>

1127
00:52:29.241 --> 00:52:31.550
<v Speaker 3>emails and we should bomb them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1128
00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:35.390
<v Speaker 3>that's literally what she saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was crazy when she said there would</v>

1129
00:52:35.391 --> 00:52:38.090
<v Speaker 3>be repercussions militarily to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>

1130
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:39.560
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>

1131
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:41.750
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about invading puerto</v>
<v Speaker 3>rico.</v>

1132
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:44.360
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're saying there's going to be</v>

1133
00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:49.070
<v Speaker 3>military invasions because someone stole</v>
<v Speaker 3>your email</v>

1134
00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:52.700
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't secure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to defend her.</v>

1135
00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Please do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to surprise you a little</v>

1136
00:52:54.751 --> 00:52:55.351
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>

1137
00:52:55.351 --> 00:52:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should have a drink.</v>

1138
00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Do you drink?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't anymore at any moment.</v>

1139
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:04.040
<v Speaker 1>You stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just gave me sinus problems.</v>

1140
00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:06.570
<v Speaker 1>So I stopped several years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel much healthier.</v>

1141
00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Alright dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1142
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:09.930
<v Speaker 1>no pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was I talking about?</v>

1143
00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:11.850
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were gonna defend hillary clinton</v>

1144
00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.480
<v Speaker 3>because I was saying that her saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're going to attack Russia</v>

1145
00:53:15.481 --> 00:53:17.990
<v Speaker 3>because of emails is kinda crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the way leaders stock</v>

1146
00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.190
<v Speaker 1>with each other Is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1147
00:53:19.191 --> 00:53:21.040
<v Speaker 1>this is my red line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do this.</v>

1148
00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:24.080
<v Speaker 1>This is serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same as saying if you got</v>

1149
00:53:24.081 --> 00:53:25.680
<v Speaker 1>my email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to you tomorrow.</v>

1150
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:29.100
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of seriousness</v>

1151
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:32.280
<v Speaker 1>which you must convey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is separate from what he actually</v>

1152
00:53:32.281 --> 00:53:36.810
<v Speaker 1>going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was conveying I'm a Ten and a 10</v>

1153
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:41.820
<v Speaker 1>maximum code red seriousness if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you got my fucking emails.</v>

1154
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:43.530
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1155
00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:48.810
<v Speaker 1>and it changed the course of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our republic because that's where she</v>

1156
00:53:48.811 --> 00:53:50.570
<v Speaker 1>was at the legend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know if anything,</v>

1157
00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:53.790
<v Speaker 1>any of this happened and they're smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who said maybe the russians were</v>

1158
00:53:53.791 --> 00:53:55.830
<v Speaker 1>in or some russian hackers were involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

1159
00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:56.810
<v Speaker 3>WeLl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem.</v>

1160
00:53:56.811 --> 00:53:58.580
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence that the russians</v>
<v Speaker 3>did it.</v>

1161
00:53:58.581 --> 00:54:01.970
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fbi and the cia don't think there's</v>

1162
00:54:01.971 --> 00:54:03.830
<v Speaker 3>russians don't think the russians did</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1163
00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:07.550
<v Speaker 3>Like it wasn't something that there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>any definitive proof.</v>

1164
00:54:08.090 --> 00:54:11.150
<v Speaker 3>It was find out who jamie see if he</v>
<v Speaker 3>could pull this up,</v>

1165
00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:15.200
<v Speaker 3>who believed that it was Russia and who</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't believe it was Russia because</v>

1166
00:54:15.201 --> 00:54:19.100
<v Speaker 3>there was some like very prominent</v>
<v Speaker 3>security people that were hired to</v>

1167
00:54:19.101 --> 00:54:21.440
<v Speaker 3>investigate zero evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was Russia,</v>

1168
00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.810
<v Speaker 3>so it was just a diffusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an end.</v>

1169
00:54:23.811 --> 00:54:28.100
<v Speaker 3>You could tell that it was a planned</v>
<v Speaker 3>diffusion because of that white house</v>

1170
00:54:28.101 --> 00:54:31.610
<v Speaker 3>correspondents dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She made a joke about riding a horse</v>

1171
00:54:31.611 --> 00:54:34.590
<v Speaker 3>with putin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she made this russian joke.</v>

1172
00:54:34.591 --> 00:54:38.840
<v Speaker 3>So there's this like theme and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit joke to whoever wrote it should be</v>

1173
00:54:38.841 --> 00:54:40.490
<v Speaker 3>slapped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was terrible.</v>

1174
00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.130
<v Speaker 3>Like the way it was set up was it was if</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>

1175
00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:46.430
<v Speaker 3>if somebody pitched that around the joke</v>
<v Speaker 3>writers table,</v>

1176
00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:49.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it was like it was tony hinchcliffe</v>

1177
00:54:49.551 --> 00:54:50.960
<v Speaker 3>and Jeff Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they'd be like,</v>

1178
00:54:50.961 --> 00:54:51.321
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1179
00:54:51.321 --> 00:54:52.760
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one's not going to do that.</v>

1180
00:54:52.761 --> 00:54:56.180
<v Speaker 3>THat's a terrible joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not a good joke and she,</v>

1181
00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:58.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know how to deliver it either and</v>

1182
00:54:58.101 --> 00:55:03.101
<v Speaker 3>it was just a clunky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an extra attempt to connect putin and</v>

1183
00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.600
<v Speaker 3>trump because people are scared of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

1184
00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:09.410
<v Speaker 3>but it was so shitty and ham handed that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just didn't work.</v>

1185
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.390
<v Speaker 3>And everybody knows there's no fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence.</v>

1186
00:55:11.391 --> 00:55:13.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no evidence of russia's doing</v>

1187
00:55:13.071 --> 00:55:14.000
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None.</v>

1188
00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Russia thing took her from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1189
00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:19.910
<v Speaker 1>serious statesperson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1190
00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:24.340
<v Speaker 1>the most experienced person who ever ran</v>
<v Speaker 1>for president to a little bit.</v>

1191
00:55:24.341 --> 00:55:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1192
00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:26.403
<v Speaker 1>She had desperate</v>

1193
00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.600
<v Speaker 3>bose desperate move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you didn't have any other options.</v>

1194
00:55:30.601 --> 00:55:31.730
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she went code red.</v>

1195
00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.910
<v Speaker 3>She started talking shit back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She started making things up back and</v>

1196
00:55:35.911 --> 00:55:37.800
<v Speaker 3>connecting him to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just.</v>

1197
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:41.670
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing was so sorted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me that was the most unfortunate</v>

1198
00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:45.480
<v Speaker 3>thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you do see all this stuff on tv,</v>

1199
00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:48.300
<v Speaker 3>one thing that you can't deny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might not affect you and it might not</v>

1200
00:55:48.301 --> 00:55:50.870
<v Speaker 3>affect me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are certain people that fall</v>

1201
00:55:50.871 --> 00:55:54.840
<v Speaker 3>the tone of the leaders of this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you have a guy who's the</v>

1202
00:55:54.841 --> 00:55:58.950
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you know is going to say insulting,</v>

1203
00:55:58.951 --> 00:56:02.650
<v Speaker 3>should call John Stewart a pussy in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a tweet at 1:30 in the morning,</v>

1204
00:56:02.651 --> 00:56:06.510
<v Speaker 3>like that sets the tone for the country</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to make some people very</v>

1205
00:56:06.511 --> 00:56:08.460
<v Speaker 3>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some people that love to talk</v>

1206
00:56:08.461 --> 00:56:10.030
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They loved insult people and they're</v>

1207
00:56:10.031 --> 00:56:10.940
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah,</v>

1208
00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.090
<v Speaker 3>open season.</v>

1209
00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.700
<v Speaker 3>the way I described that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said political correctness took a</v>

1210
00:56:14.701 --> 00:56:17.160
<v Speaker 3>missile to the deq because that's what</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like.</v>

1211
00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:20.130
<v Speaker 3>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the guy at the top of the totem</v>

1212
00:56:20.131 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 3>pole and we can relax our standards now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All The things that had been annoying</v>

1213
00:56:24.191 --> 00:56:26.350
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people nitpicking about behaviors</v>

1214
00:56:26.351 --> 00:56:31.210
<v Speaker 3>and insults and safe words and safe</v>
<v Speaker 3>spaces and all that stuff's kinda gone.</v>

1215
00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:32.620
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1216
00:56:32.621 --> 00:56:33.454
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1217
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:37.300
<v Speaker 3>So it does affect the way people think</v>
<v Speaker 3>and behave right there.</v>

1218
00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:40.300
<v Speaker 3>There's almost nobody who won't use the</v>
<v Speaker 3>word pussy in public.</v>

1219
00:56:40.301 --> 00:56:42.270
<v Speaker 3>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

1220
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.590
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you remember so many months ago when</v>

1221
00:56:44.591 --> 00:56:47.630
<v Speaker 3>that just wasn't a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't say that.</v>

1222
00:56:47.631 --> 00:56:51.580
<v Speaker 3>That's so drew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It became like a constant like dinner</v>

1223
00:56:51.581 --> 00:56:53.760
<v Speaker 3>table talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people sitting around talking st</v>

1224
00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:57.410
<v Speaker 3>grab the pussy and discovery from women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even deciding.</v>

1225
00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:00.220
<v Speaker 3>Not even bend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My girlfriend says so true.</v>

1226
00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.650
<v Speaker 3>It's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is so true.</v>

1227
00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:04.420
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1228
00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1229
00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:09.760
<v Speaker 3>I think that we go one way and we go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other and I think that people get</v>

1230
00:57:09.761 --> 00:57:11.260
<v Speaker 3>tired of too much left and they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>some.</v>

1231
00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:13.090
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's why we went from</v>

1232
00:57:13.091 --> 00:57:16.120
<v Speaker 3>carter to reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we went from bush to clinton.</v>

1233
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:19.840
<v Speaker 3>I just think that's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's what we've always done and</v>

1234
00:57:19.841 --> 00:57:21.110
<v Speaker 3>I think people are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1235
00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:23.020
<v Speaker 3>I also believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've said this publicly,</v>

1236
00:57:23.021 --> 00:57:26.680
<v Speaker 3>I think the whole caitlyn jenner thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a big effect on because people were</v>

1237
00:57:26.681 --> 00:57:28.480
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why in the fuck are we doing?</v>

1238
00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:31.930
<v Speaker 3>That's the athlete of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is woman of the year for glamour</v>

1239
00:57:31.931 --> 00:57:35.350
<v Speaker 3>magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you see her on the ellen show</v>

1240
00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:37.240
<v Speaker 3>and she doesn't believe in gay marriage</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

1241
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:39.760
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is madness.</v>

1242
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:42.670
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're accepting madness as being okay.</v>

1243
00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:48.120
<v Speaker 3>And I think because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're so accepting and so sensitive</v>

1244
00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:52.690
<v Speaker 3>that anything involving gender gets a</v>
<v Speaker 3>free pass on all of its ludicrous</v>

1245
00:57:52.691 --> 00:57:55.450
<v Speaker 3>aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she's a ludicrous person.</v>

1246
00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:58.030
<v Speaker 3>but we gave it a free pass because she</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to be a man that she became a</v>

1247
00:57:58.031 --> 00:57:59.890
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She will fucking doesn't believe in gay</v>

1248
00:57:59.891 --> 00:58:01.640
<v Speaker 3>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy.</v>

1249
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:03.190
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when ellen asked her about it,</v>

1250
00:58:03.191 --> 00:58:03.701
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>

1256
00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:15.490
<v Speaker 3>But we're not supposed to say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're supposed to just accept it.</v>

1257
00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:17.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people at home all across the</v>

1258
00:58:17.561 --> 00:58:20.650
<v Speaker 3>country throwing their fucking beer cans</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the kitchen.</v>

1259
00:58:20.651 --> 00:58:21.700
<v Speaker 3>Just flipped out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1260
00:58:21.701 --> 00:58:23.740
<v Speaker 3>Are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we doing?</v>

1261
00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:28.540
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's this reaction when</v>
<v Speaker 3>things go way too far left when there's</v>

1262
00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:30.970
<v Speaker 3>78 different gender pronouns that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to learn.</v>

1263
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.720
<v Speaker 3>When you know political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take some crazy path where you're</v>

1264
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:39.640
<v Speaker 3>removing the general these confederate</v>
<v Speaker 3>flag from the roof and pulling it off a</v>

1265
00:58:39.641 --> 00:58:41.280
<v Speaker 3>tv land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got to get this fucking.</v>

1266
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:45.970
<v Speaker 3>It just like things go so far left that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an automatic slingshot effect</v>

1267
00:58:45.971 --> 00:58:48.430
<v Speaker 3>and they start going right again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay with getting rid of the</v>

1268
00:58:48.431 --> 00:58:50.420
<v Speaker 3>confederate flag By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they could have.</v>

1269
00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:51.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1270
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:53.770
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does represent bad things to people,</v>

1271
00:58:53.771 --> 00:58:58.420
<v Speaker 3>but can you just fucking go in there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>cgi that shit or something or is it okay</v>

1272
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:01.600
<v Speaker 3>to have it in there because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>represents the past,</v>

1273
00:59:01.601 --> 00:59:03.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you could go to,</v>

1274
00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:04.530
<v Speaker 3>you can go to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1275
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:07.180
<v Speaker 3>al jolson videos on youtube and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could watch them.</v>

1276
00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:11.950
<v Speaker 3>Here's my take on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't ask a lot from other</v>

1277
00:59:11.951 --> 00:59:13.790
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you.</v>

1278
00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:16.840
<v Speaker 3>So you have this confederate flag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of people like it because it's</v>

1279
00:59:16.841 --> 00:59:17.171
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1280
00:59:17.171 --> 00:59:18.360
<v Speaker 3>it's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'S the south.</v>

1281
00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:21.200
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to respect the people like what</v>

1282
00:59:21.201 --> 00:59:22.034
<v Speaker 3>they like.</v>

1283
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:25.670
<v Speaker 2>But another big part of the public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just really,</v>

1284
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:29.480
<v Speaker 2>really offended by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like not in a normal offensive way,</v>

1285
00:59:29.481 --> 00:59:31.070
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bad word,</v>

1286
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.233
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1287
00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:37.220
<v Speaker 2>the deepest pain the country has ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced the slavery.</v>

1288
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:41.680
<v Speaker 2>So if you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can't allow your fellow citizen,</v>

1289
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:43.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little bit of respect,</v>

1290
00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:44.571
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1291
00:59:44.571 --> 00:59:47.570
<v Speaker 2>this is really inconvenient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could keep my confederate flag,</v>

1292
00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:50.540
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're not asking a lot.</v>

1293
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:54.020
<v Speaker 2>It's just not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

1294
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.910
<v Speaker 2>Unless you own the dukes of hazard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1295
00:59:55.911 --> 00:59:59.660
<v Speaker 2>where's my fucking mOney?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you kidding me?</v>

1296
00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:02.270
<v Speaker 2>We've had played it for 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

1297
01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it represents not just slavery,</v>

1298
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:10.370
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the most awful things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has ever happened to human beings.</v>

1299
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:14.420
<v Speaker 2>The other awful thing is war represents</v>
<v Speaker 2>a war civil war,</v>

1300
01:00:14.421 --> 01:00:18.200
<v Speaker 2>so the two most awful things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery and war,</v>

1301
01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.930
<v Speaker 2>it represents both of those represents a</v>
<v Speaker 2>war between two people in the same two</v>

1302
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:24.800
<v Speaker 2>groups of people on the same land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mass over slavery.</v>

1303
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:30.010
<v Speaker 2>So It's death on top of horrific in</v>
<v Speaker 2>capturing and enslaving of people.</v>

1304
01:00:31.431 --> 01:00:33.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hate to be insensitive,</v>

1305
01:00:33.651 --> 01:00:36.170
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't the winning side</v>
<v Speaker 2>troops,</v>

1306
01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:41.210
<v Speaker 2>so they did lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's interesting is it just a few</v>

1307
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:42.620
<v Speaker 2>decades ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever the dukes of hazzard was on tv,</v>

1308
01:00:42.621 --> 01:00:45.650
<v Speaker 2>it didn't bother us at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really fascinating to me that</v>

1309
01:00:45.651 --> 01:00:47.870
<v Speaker 2>they were allowed to have it and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't an issue,</v>

1310
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.070
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1311
01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe just people weren't thinking about</v>

1312
01:00:51.521 --> 01:00:53.120
<v Speaker 2>it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once you started thinking about it,</v>

1313
01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:55.550
<v Speaker 2>so the thing isn't that fascinating that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't an issue,</v>

1314
01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:58.880
<v Speaker 2>but we were all aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of our issues or psychological.</v>

1315
01:00:59.240 --> 01:00:59.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1316
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.360
<v Speaker 2>once you got food and nobody's shooting</v>
<v Speaker 2>at you,</v>

1317
01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:05.360
<v Speaker 2>your problems tend to be mental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1318
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless that whatever that image is</v>

1319
01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:10.100
<v Speaker 2>provoking violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1320
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:12.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the nazi flag you can't have,</v>

1321
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:15.320
<v Speaker 2>they lost to which you can't have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

1322
01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:16.870
<v Speaker 2>We won't give you that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1323
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1324
01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:23.060
<v Speaker 2>it's like people don't ask a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just not a lot to ask to.</v>

1325
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that fascinating?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the english came when we had a war</v>

1326
01:01:26.211 --> 01:01:27.044
<v Speaker 2>with england,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1327
01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:29.600
<v Speaker 2>For our independence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They killed a lot of americans.</v>

1328
01:01:29.601 --> 01:01:31.220
<v Speaker 2>You could have an english flag flying</v>
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>

1329
01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1330
01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.520
<v Speaker 2>that ended so politely though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it?</v>

1331
01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:37.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1332
01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:41.080
<v Speaker 2>I think the british,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lose territory better than anybody.</v>

1333
01:01:41.370 --> 01:01:43.960
<v Speaker 2>They'll give you their sword.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1334
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:46.770
<v Speaker 2>we conquered much of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1335
01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.560
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one didn't work out.</v>

1336
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:51.830
<v Speaker 2>You put up a good fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for you.</v>

1337
01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take your country back.</v>

1338
01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:56.690
<v Speaker 2>it is interesting though that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people that would argue for the</v>

1339
01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.300
<v Speaker 2>confederate flag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but almost no one would argue for the</v>

1340
01:01:59.301 --> 01:02:01.630
<v Speaker 2>nazi flag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1341
01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.170
<v Speaker 2>it was probably somebody does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1342
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:04.460
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1343
01:02:04.461 --> 01:02:05.330
<v Speaker 2>The nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1344
01:02:05.331 --> 01:02:09.590
<v Speaker 2>it couldn't have been that everyone in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany was represented by the nazis.</v>

1345
01:02:09.591 --> 01:02:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's never a group.</v>

1346
01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:15.740
<v Speaker 2>There's never 100 percent compliance and</v>
<v Speaker 2>group mindset of any fucking country.</v>

1347
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:16.750
<v Speaker 2>It's never existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1348
01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 2>It's just not how people are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we give the</v>

1349
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.850
<v Speaker 3>germans a pass because they were a part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that whole nazi flag thing.</v>

1350
01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:25.920
<v Speaker 3>But when we look at the confederate</v>
<v Speaker 3>flag,</v>

1351
01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:29.250
<v Speaker 3>like if you're down with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be.</v>

1352
01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:32.010
<v Speaker 3>It has to be like the two core things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

1353
01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:34.320
<v Speaker 3>you're at war with the north until you</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in slavery.</v>

1354
01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:35.550
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1355
01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:38.080
<v Speaker 3>it can't just be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a leonard scattered fan,</v>

1356
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>images,</v>

1357
01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.690
<v Speaker 3>images.</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1358
01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:45.150
<v Speaker 3>in the very beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>visual persuasion is the strongest it</v>

1359
01:02:45.151 --> 01:02:45.984
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just want,</v>

1360
01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.500
<v Speaker 3>you just don't want to look at that</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing if you're on the wrong side of,</v>

1361
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:50.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that part of history.</v>

1362
01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:54.660
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about that once because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to cheech and eatsa the where the</v>

1363
01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:57.860
<v Speaker 3>mayan pyramids are in the yucatan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1364
01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:00.570
<v Speaker 3>when we were driving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a long drive to get to the</v>

1365
01:03:00.571 --> 01:03:02.820
<v Speaker 3>pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as we're driving and saw this giant</v>

1366
01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:04.590
<v Speaker 3>cocacola billboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1367
01:03:04.591 --> 01:03:09.120
<v Speaker 3>how bizarre is that symbol like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>symbols so etched in the consciousness</v>

1368
01:03:09.121 --> 01:03:11.310
<v Speaker 3>of most people in the modern world.</v>

1369
01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:14.550
<v Speaker 3>But to see it in the jungle was so</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange.</v>

1370
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:17.370
<v Speaker 3>It's just this giant thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>represent.</v>

1371
01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:17.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1372
01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:22.990
<v Speaker 3>it's like instantaneous representation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it new or was it leftover from the,</v>

1373
01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.270
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mayan civilization that had it.</v>

1374
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:30.900
<v Speaker 3>It was newer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Newer than that.</v>

1375
01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.150
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>symbols are very strange.</v>

1376
01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:34.171
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1377
01:03:34.171 --> 01:03:34.801
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1378
01:03:34.801 --> 01:03:37.710
<v Speaker 3>we accept them and they have become a</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal part of our society.</v>

1379
01:03:37.711 --> 01:03:39.660
<v Speaker 3>When you drive it down the road and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1380
01:03:39.661 --> 01:03:40.530
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of car is that?</v>

1381
01:03:40.531 --> 01:03:41.480
<v Speaker 3>And you see the bow tie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1382
01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:43.560
<v Speaker 3>it's a chevy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like these symbols,</v>

1383
01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:46.380
<v Speaker 3>like the instantaneous recognizable</v>
<v Speaker 3>symbols.</v>

1384
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:50.730
<v Speaker 3>Have you noticed how easily boys can</v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize the model of a car?</v>

1385
01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some kind of weird,</v>

1386
01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:55.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender specific skill.</v>

1387
01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:57.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so because brian cowen</v>

1388
01:03:57.241 --> 01:04:00.300
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know jack shit about cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian kennedy could recognize like a</v>

1389
01:04:00.301 --> 01:04:01.860
<v Speaker 3>tesla and a car.</v>

1390
01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:04.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's owned maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would have to be in the last</v>

1391
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.471
<v Speaker 3>couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is.</v>

1392
01:04:05.471 --> 01:04:07.110
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never met a grown man.</v>

1393
01:04:07.111 --> 01:04:10.200
<v Speaker 3>It's like a manly guy who knows less</v>
<v Speaker 3>cares less about cars,</v>

1394
01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:12.780
<v Speaker 3>but still if you said what's that model</v>
<v Speaker 3>of car?</v>

1395
01:04:12.781 --> 01:04:15.690
<v Speaker 3>And it was probably wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd see a mustang and the camaro.</v>

1396
01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:16.740
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trust me,</v>

1397
01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:19.110
<v Speaker 3>lIke he is just brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had conversation with them.</v>

1398
01:04:19.111 --> 01:04:23.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a fucking 69 mustang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell.</v>

1399
01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.160
<v Speaker 3>They look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The debt doesn't say that's a</v>

1400
01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:28.530
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 69 mustang to you turning</v>
<v Speaker 3>your god damn America card.</v>

1401
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:29.980

<v Speaker 3>Boy.</v>

1402
01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:32.430
<v Speaker 3>Sixty nine camaro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Casey.</v>

1403
01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.530

<v Speaker 3>You should fucking know what that is.</v>

1404
01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:37.180
<v Speaker 3>You should just know as a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't know a 68,</v>

1405
01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:39.960
<v Speaker 3>69.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should look at the headlights.</v>

1406
01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:43.500
<v Speaker 3>Taillights are different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's different.</v>

1407
01:04:43.501 --> 01:04:46.710
<v Speaker 3>In 68 have the same boxy tail lights</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the 67 hand,</v>

1408
01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:49.020
<v Speaker 3>whereas the 69 is lengthened a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

1409
01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:50.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$69 a year.</v>

1410
01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:54.810
<v Speaker 3>That's the right year to change my name</v>
<v Speaker 3>to caitlyn and no,</v>

1411
01:04:54.811 --> 01:04:57.300
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe she knows a lot about cars.</v>

1412
01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:02.040
<v Speaker 3>That was the other thIng about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>caitlin thing that drove me crazy.</v>

1413
01:05:02.041 --> 01:05:04.200
<v Speaker 3>She killed somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knock someone into traffic,</v>

1414
01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:06.720
<v Speaker 3>knock some leading the traffic and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't paying attention.</v>

1415
01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.930
<v Speaker 3>Lady went head on into traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone slammed into her and killed her</v>

1416
01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:12.240
<v Speaker 3>hummer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the last hummers in America</v>

1417
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:15.420
<v Speaker 3>slammed in her and killed her and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>never gets discussed.</v>

1418
01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:17.920
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does talk shows and instead of talking</v>

1419
01:05:17.921 --> 01:05:21.220
<v Speaker 3>about this horrific accident that caused</v>
<v Speaker 3>some fellow human their life,</v>

1420
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:24.970
<v Speaker 3>she talks about gender and nail polish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1421
01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:26.260
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1422
01:05:26.261 --> 01:05:28.300
<v Speaker 3>I did not know about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know about that.</v>

1423
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:29.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't know.</v>

1424
01:05:29.111 --> 01:05:30.610
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big part of the problem.</v>

1425
01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.610
<v Speaker 3>I've been bad at caitlin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1426
01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.240
<v Speaker 3>since,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since,</v>

1427
01:05:34.241 --> 01:05:36.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was bruce because I happened to be</v>

1428
01:05:36.251 --> 01:05:40.960
<v Speaker 3>at a flight one time across country and</v>
<v Speaker 3>bruce at the time was in the seat in</v>

1429
01:05:40.961 --> 01:05:45.760
<v Speaker 3>front of me and leaned is a seed all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way back and I couldn't use my laptop</v>

1430
01:05:45.761 --> 01:05:46.594
<v Speaker 3>for five hours.</v>

1431
01:05:47.490 --> 01:05:49.930
<v Speaker 3>And you're mad about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's.</v>

1432
01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:52.360
<v Speaker 3>Can you lean your back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have more room?</v>

1433
01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:56.710
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really work that way because</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you put your laptop on your lap?</v>

1434
01:05:57.010 --> 01:06:01.550
<v Speaker 3>Like a actual lap top?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That coulD work.</v>

1435
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.060
<v Speaker 3>You could have done it if I was right</v>
<v Speaker 3>next to you how to fix this whole thing.</v>

1436
01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:08.200
<v Speaker 3>If only the lab you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad he's a Chickie.</v>

1437
01:06:08.201 --> 01:06:12.340
<v Speaker 3>Fucking ruined my typing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why it's called the laptop.</v>

1438
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sits in your lap,</v>

1439
01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:16.060
<v Speaker 3>but then your balls get really warm and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say it kills sperm.</v>

1440
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:18.150
<v Speaker 3>So it depends on what you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplish.</v>

1441
01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.300
<v Speaker 3>For some people they'd be just heating</v>
<v Speaker 3>them babies up all the time.</v>

1442
01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.850
<v Speaker 3>It was a long flight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might want to kill a few just to.</v>

1443
01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:30.300
<v Speaker 3>Just to take the pressure off is to</v>
<v Speaker 3>relax the my friend already should fear</v>

1444
01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:33.040
<v Speaker 3>always gets mad at that too.</v>

1445
01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:35.500
<v Speaker 3>People lean back on him because he's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>big.</v>

1446
01:06:35.501 --> 01:06:37.560
<v Speaker 3>He's like six [inaudible] six three or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1447
01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:39.340
<v Speaker 3>Six four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's super tall,</v>

1448
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:43.300
<v Speaker 3>so he's got these goofy ass stork legs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he can't fit them under the seat.</v>

1449
01:06:43.301 --> 01:06:44.340
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1450
01:06:44.410 --> 01:06:48.010
<v Speaker 3>I feel sorry for tall people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anytime they try to travel anywhere</v>

1451
01:06:48.011 --> 01:06:49.900
<v Speaker 3>outside their own house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even in cars,</v>

1452
01:06:49.901 --> 01:06:51.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get in someone's car sometimes and</v>

1453
01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:52.750
<v Speaker 3>your legs are jammed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1454
01:06:52.751 --> 01:06:55.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight and my legs are jammed up on what</v>

1455
01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:56.950
<v Speaker 3>is a giant person do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1456
01:06:57.010 --> 01:06:59.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think like what would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>my equivalent,</v>

1457
01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:03.580
<v Speaker 3>like how small would the car have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I could feel what was shack feels</v>

1458
01:07:03.581 --> 01:07:06.670
<v Speaker 3>like when he gets the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has to take seats out and put seats</v>

1459
01:07:06.671 --> 01:07:08.950
<v Speaker 3>in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen him with a do to cars</v>

1460
01:07:08.951 --> 01:07:10.150
<v Speaker 3>for him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1461
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:11.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's had some custom made cars where</v>

1462
01:07:11.951 --> 01:07:15.880
<v Speaker 3>they literally take the seat out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>front and install it in the back.</v>

1463
01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.351
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>

1464
01:07:17.351 --> 01:07:18.610
<v Speaker 3>that might look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1465
01:07:18.611 --> 01:07:22.460
<v Speaker 3>you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's seven feet tall so that this thing</v>

1466
01:07:22.461 --> 01:07:26.080
<v Speaker 3>about how much more length you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with his arms,</v>

1467
01:07:26.081 --> 01:07:27.510
<v Speaker 3>his legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then his,</v>

1468
01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.410
<v Speaker 3>the height,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I bet they would have to lower the</v>

1469
01:07:29.411 --> 01:07:31.450
<v Speaker 3>seat down so you could see better out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the windshield.</v>

1470
01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise he has to kind of bend down</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time he's driving.</v>

1471
01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:38.470
<v Speaker 3>I just says this vision of him with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>miata sitting in the trunk,</v>

1472
01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:40.740
<v Speaker 3>the trunk open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1473
01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:42.790
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet he can't drive a miata.</v>

1474
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:45.040
<v Speaker 3>I bet he can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet there's no way that he can get</v>

1475
01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:48.100
<v Speaker 3>farther,</v>
<v Speaker 3>far enough back strap one to each foot</v>

1476
01:07:48.101 --> 01:07:50.750
<v Speaker 3>and skated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he would,</v>

1477
01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.940
<v Speaker 3>he could do is just put the steering</v>
<v Speaker 3>wheel.</v>

1478
01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:55.340
<v Speaker 3>He's so rich because could have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>steering wheel put in the middle and</v>

1479
01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.700
<v Speaker 3>then push everything back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1480
01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:01.550
<v Speaker 3>forget that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I know for sure for sure they had</v>

1481
01:08:01.551 --> 01:08:05.230
<v Speaker 3>one of those custom tv shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>custom car shows where they do things</v>

1482
01:08:05.231 --> 01:08:06.970
<v Speaker 3>for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was west side.</v>

1483
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.430
<v Speaker 3>What does that one show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>West coast,</v>

1484
01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.500
<v Speaker 3>west coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>west coast customers.</v>

1485
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that one famous company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they took her car and they put the</v>

1486
01:08:14.891 --> 01:08:18.620
<v Speaker 3>seat in the back for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably still needed extra room,</v>

1487
01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:23.420
<v Speaker 3>like suddenly you do for tv.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we gotta we gotta put the seat in</v>

1488
01:08:23.421 --> 01:08:27.910
<v Speaker 3>the back maybe because I got a feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>he drives a regular cars somehow.</v>

1489
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:30.680
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's probably some cars that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't drive though.</v>

1490
01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.530
<v Speaker 3>Like one of those old porsches little</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny ones.</v>

1491
01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.230
<v Speaker 3>Probably most of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1492
01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:37.890
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>point being what were we?</v>

1493
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's terrible to be as general leaned</v>

1494
01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.780
<v Speaker 3>back and fucked up your day.</v>

1495
01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All went bad from there.</v>

1496
01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:45.103
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and look,</v>

1497
01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:48.230
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's not terrible person.</v>

1498
01:08:48.231 --> 01:08:51.470
<v Speaker 3>She's not a terrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the worst human in the world.</v>

1499
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:55.490
<v Speaker 3>It's just like when this gets paraded</v>
<v Speaker 3>out as being like this very important</v>

1500
01:08:55.491 --> 01:08:58.100
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as he gets paraded out and you</v>

1501
01:08:58.101 --> 01:09:00.290
<v Speaker 3>make a big deal and you want to go on</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these talk shows,</v>

1502
01:09:00.291 --> 01:09:02.060
<v Speaker 3>you want to talk about yourself and done</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1503
01:09:02.061 --> 01:09:06.680
<v Speaker 3>they have to examine you as an actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>person and not just stop at gender.</v>

1504
01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:08.880
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>

1505
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:11.690
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of representatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for instance,</v>

1506
01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:12.940
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1507
01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:17.510
<v Speaker 3>the woman who created sirius satellite</v>
<v Speaker 3>radio and also,</v>

1508
01:09:17.511 --> 01:09:22.511
<v Speaker 3>I believe she invented gps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was born a man and had a sex change.</v>

1509
01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:27.110
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met with her and had an interview with</v>

1510
01:09:27.111 --> 01:09:28.780
<v Speaker 3>her about her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1511
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:29.510
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

1512
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:32.720
<v Speaker 3>She made a robot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's super fucking smart,</v>

1513
01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:37.520
<v Speaker 3>like crazy smart and is working on</v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence and programming</v>

1514
01:09:37.521 --> 01:09:39.120
<v Speaker 3>this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1515
01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:44.500
<v Speaker 3>this like it's ahead of her wife being</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she married her when she was a man</v>

1516
01:09:44.901 --> 01:09:48.330
<v Speaker 3>and then became a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stayed together and being a is like</v>

1517
01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.190
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1518
01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:53.930
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence thing that she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>consistently updating as technology gets</v>

1519
01:09:53.931 --> 01:09:56.150
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She updates it and gives it more and</v>

1520
01:09:56.151 --> 01:09:57.830
<v Speaker 3>more intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you want to focus on someone</v>

1521
01:09:57.831 --> 01:10:01.520
<v Speaker 3>who's a transgender person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe that would be a good example</v>

1522
01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:04.790
<v Speaker 3>instead of just concentrating on a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>who used to be really good at running</v>

1523
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.350
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1524
01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:09.740
<v Speaker 3>and now lived with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>materialists on a reality show,</v>

1525
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:13.830
<v Speaker 3>not just running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they come and they have no,</v>

1526
01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.020
<v Speaker 3>no purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And really.</v>

1527
01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:15.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1528
01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:17.660
<v Speaker 3>so now no one's really into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>decathlon.</v>

1529
01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he's awesome,</v>

1530
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:22.010
<v Speaker 3>but nobody gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why he does any of those sports</v>

1531
01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:23.780
<v Speaker 3>where there's no professional side of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1532
01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:26.990
<v Speaker 3>like it's probably a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say that,</v>

1533
01:10:26.991 --> 01:10:28.700
<v Speaker 3>but then that's not true because a</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling.</v>

1534
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:32.630
<v Speaker 3>I think wrestling is a great sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have a professional venue,</v>

1535
01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:34.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other than like fake wrestling.</v>

1536
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever think about how weird it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people can get invested in like a</v>

1537
01:10:38.451 --> 01:10:40.130
<v Speaker 3>team?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1538
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:41.840
<v Speaker 3>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1539
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:44.780
<v Speaker 3>Why do you care so much about your team?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about that all the time.</v>

1540
01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:46.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1541
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

1542
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:49.610
<v Speaker 3>We talk about it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a tribal thing.</v>

1543
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:52.880
<v Speaker 3>People love being in a group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like being on team trump.</v>

1544
01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:55.560
<v Speaker 3>They liked being on team hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know there's there.</v>

1545
01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:00.680
<v Speaker 3>I saw I was watching so much tribal</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior leading down like arguments</v>

1546
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:03.080
<v Speaker 3>between people on twitter.</v>

1547
01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:07.370
<v Speaker 3>It's like you guys are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you doing?</v>

1548
01:11:07.371 --> 01:11:09.140
<v Speaker 3>You're arguing with people you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>even know,</v>

1549
01:11:09.141 --> 01:11:11.090
<v Speaker 3>and I look at their timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll look at the timeline.</v>

1550
01:11:11.091 --> 01:11:12.970
<v Speaker 3>They're arguing for seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight hours in a row.</v>

1551
01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:17.520
<v Speaker 3>You could be doing so much to improve</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life instead of like insulting.</v>

1552
01:11:17.521 --> 01:11:19.860
<v Speaker 3>Hillary supporters are insulting trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>supporters.</v>

1553
01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:20.983
<v Speaker 3>They're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1554
01:11:21.230 --> 01:11:26.230
<v Speaker 3>it says weird natural thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People joined teams that joined tribes.</v>

1555
01:11:26.671 --> 01:11:29.820
<v Speaker 3>They have groups that they like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it makes sense when you're looking</v>

1556
01:11:29.821 --> 01:11:33.750
<v Speaker 3>at say your ethnicity because probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>biologically we're,</v>

1557
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:37.110
<v Speaker 3>we're primed to prefer it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it looks like us,</v>

1558
01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just just naturally primed for that.</v>

1559
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.420
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that's true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Explain black eyes and asian chicks</v>

1560
01:11:42.421 --> 01:11:43.254
<v Speaker 3>ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>

1561
01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:46.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1562
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:52.270
<v Speaker 3>but in general</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

1563
01:11:52.450 --> 01:11:55.110
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so it makes sense if you're looking</v>

1564
01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:57.630
<v Speaker 3>at like big groups or a country or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1565
01:11:57.631 --> 01:12:02.631
<v Speaker 3>but a sports team as such,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a random collection of rules that,</v>

1566
01:12:02.761 --> 01:12:04.650
<v Speaker 3>why you could be emotionally invested in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1567
01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:06.900
<v Speaker 3>I've tried because it seems like such</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheap entertainment.</v>

1568
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:08.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to.</v>

1569
01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:11.040
<v Speaker 3>You live a wonderful life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scott Adams and you're wealthy.</v>

1570
01:12:11.041 --> 01:12:13.150
<v Speaker 3>Successful man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1571
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.850
<v Speaker 3>for some people there's not a whole lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>to look forward to it.</v>

1572
01:12:16.851 --> 01:12:20.010
<v Speaker 3>And this is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I'm not using a broad blanket</v>

1573
01:12:20.011 --> 01:12:23.700
<v Speaker 3>to paint all sports fans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that there's a lot of people</v>

1574
01:12:23.701 --> 01:12:28.020
<v Speaker 3>out there that look to the success of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their team and they get happiness or</v>

1575
01:12:28.021 --> 01:12:30.210
<v Speaker 3>sadness from that and if you're in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>team,</v>

1576
01:12:30.211 --> 01:12:34.260
<v Speaker 3>like if you're in cleveland and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>kick ass and win the world title,</v>

1577
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have the world heavyweight</v>
<v Speaker 3>champion of the ufc lives in cleveland</v>

1578
01:12:36.901 --> 01:12:39.060
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you get some cleveland pride,</v>

1579
01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:43.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that almost works until you</v>

1580
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:46.500
<v Speaker 3>consider that there are like raiders</v>
<v Speaker 3>fans,</v>

1581
01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:50.520
<v Speaker 3>like they just keep losing and losing</v>
<v Speaker 3>raiders is a different thing and they</v>

1582
01:12:50.521 --> 01:12:53.820
<v Speaker 3>got to be thinking this will not make me</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel good at the end of the year.</v>

1583
01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:55.320
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But raiders is like,</v>

1584
01:12:55.321 --> 01:12:58.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Raters is a weird one because raiders is</v>

1585
01:12:58.531 --> 01:13:00.450
<v Speaker 3>like rap music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a thug,</v>

1586
01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck.</v>

1587
01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:03.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm a raiders fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different thing.</v>

1588
01:13:03.721 --> 01:13:05.820
<v Speaker 3>Raiders is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a whole different animal.</v>

1589
01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:09.270
<v Speaker 3>And then the cubs fan cubs fans up until</v>
<v Speaker 3>this year,</v>

1590
01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:11.730
<v Speaker 3>we're like the loyal we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1591
01:13:11.731 --> 01:13:14.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really in it for the winds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just love the cubs.</v>

1592
01:13:14.431 --> 01:13:16.110
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cubs are new every year.</v>

1593
01:13:16.111 --> 01:13:18.210
<v Speaker 3>It's a different fucking person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1594
01:13:18.211 --> 01:13:20.400
<v Speaker 3>that's what's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a totally different group of</v>

1595
01:13:20.401 --> 01:13:22.590
<v Speaker 3>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the cubs from five years ago,</v>

1596
01:13:22.591 --> 01:13:25.490
<v Speaker 3>how could you love the cubs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These aren't the same people and then</v>

1597
01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.620
<v Speaker 3>the team can just go to another town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1598
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:29.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking nuts.</v>

1599
01:13:29.131 --> 01:13:31.080
<v Speaker 3>Like the la rams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we get the rams?</v>

1600
01:13:31.081 --> 01:13:32.580
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we doing here?</v>

1601
01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:33.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1602
01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.730
<v Speaker 3>and then what's going to happen to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>raiders are going to go to vegas now.</v>

1603
01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:38.670
<v Speaker 3>Then the raiders fans going to follow</v>
<v Speaker 3>them over to vegas.</v>

1604
01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:40.260
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they don't.</v>

1605
01:13:40.261 --> 01:13:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes people get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Teams leave and they get pissed off.</v>

1606
01:13:43.570 --> 01:13:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Vegas seems like a good fit though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it?</v>

1607
01:13:45.690 --> 01:13:48.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was all created because,</v>

1608
01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all sports teams in this country</v>

1609
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:55.790
<v Speaker 3>essentially were a response to war being</v>
<v Speaker 3>over and people thinking with real good</v>

1610
01:13:58.531 --> 01:14:03.531
<v Speaker 3>reason that men at least need war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need some form of war to develop</v>

1611
01:14:05.131 --> 01:14:10.131
<v Speaker 3>character and to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to build strong like strong definitive</v>

1612
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:14.290
<v Speaker 3>nations almost need to unite and bond</v>
<v Speaker 3>with war.</v>

1613
01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:16.660
<v Speaker 3>And the concept was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1614
01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:19.450
<v Speaker 3>if we can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's figure out some sort of a game</v>

1615
01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:21.710
<v Speaker 3>that they can play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where football emerge.</v>

1616
01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:24.440
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that was conscious or</v>
<v Speaker 3>unconscious?</v>

1617
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:25.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1618
01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:25.511
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1619
01:14:25.511 --> 01:14:28.960
<v Speaker 3>it was actually discussed like it's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussed and there's been a lot of</v>

1620
01:14:28.961 --> 01:14:33.490
<v Speaker 3>historians that have concentrated on</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaders that have talked about the</v>

1621
01:14:33.491 --> 01:14:37.000
<v Speaker 3>importance of conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the importance of war in the,</v>

1622
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.863
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1623
01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.540
<v Speaker 3>the bringing the country together and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1624
01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:44.890
<v Speaker 3>the support of nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the supportive loyalty and honor and</v>

1625
01:14:44.891 --> 01:14:46.030
<v Speaker 3>pride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all of that.</v>

1626
01:14:46.031 --> 01:14:49.280
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it has to be connected with</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence and loss.</v>

1627
01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:50.920
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1628
01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:53.440
<v Speaker 3>I like that line of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1629
01:14:53.441 --> 01:14:57.910
<v Speaker 3>there was a radio lab podcast about when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they invented football that went into</v>

1630
01:14:57.911 --> 01:14:59.500
<v Speaker 3>this and pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much in depth.</v>

1631
01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.130
<v Speaker 3>God dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was radio lab,</v>

1632
01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:02.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was either,</v>

1633
01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how else it could have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been,</v>

1634
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:09.820
<v Speaker 3>but it went into it pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty in depth about the creation of</v>

1635
01:15:09.821 --> 01:15:12.040
<v Speaker 3>football and how it was originally put</v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

1636
01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:17.490
<v Speaker 3>So that would explain why sports that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are just clearly dangerous or it's still</v>

1637
01:15:18.551 --> 01:15:20.570
<v Speaker 3>illegal and popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And.</v>

1638
01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.090
<v Speaker 3>Is that a jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1639
01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:23.710
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>American football.</v>

1640
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cv.</v>

1641
01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.500
<v Speaker 3>Make that a little larger for my shitty</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes.</v>

1642
01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Scroll up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1643
01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:29.561
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>

1644
01:15:29.561 --> 01:15:30.760
<v Speaker 3>79.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1645
01:15:30.761 --> 01:15:32.800
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was made in the carlisle indian</v>

1646
01:15:32.801 --> 01:15:35.420
<v Speaker 3>school formed in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>79 to assimilate children.</v>

1647
01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:40.390
<v Speaker 3>The grandchildren of native americans</v>
<v Speaker 3>who fought in the plains wars fields.</v>

1648
01:15:40.391 --> 01:15:41.950
<v Speaker 3>The most american team of all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1649
01:15:41.951 --> 01:15:46.290
<v Speaker 3>This was about these american indians</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were fucking kicking ass playing</v>

1650
01:15:46.330 --> 01:15:47.810
<v Speaker 3>football.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was another.</v>

1651
01:15:48.670 --> 01:15:51.190
<v Speaker 3>There was another one that was about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ghost of football past.</v>

1652
01:15:51.191 --> 01:15:52.160
<v Speaker 3>That could be what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>

1653
01:15:52.210 --> 01:15:55.570
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this was the one that was about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this american indian team that was</v>

1654
01:15:55.571 --> 01:15:59.620
<v Speaker 3>really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So football was invented by native</v>

1655
01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:00.371
<v Speaker 3>americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1656
01:16:00.371 --> 01:16:00.671
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1657
01:16:00.671 --> 01:16:02.440
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just one bad ass team.</v>

1658
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:05.500
<v Speaker 3>Here it is right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to the 19th century,</v>

1659
01:16:05.501 --> 01:16:07.510
<v Speaker 3>the civil war was over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frontier was dead.</v>

1660
01:16:07.511 --> 01:16:08.770
<v Speaker 3>Young college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better anxious.</v>

1661
01:16:08.771 --> 01:16:10.900
<v Speaker 3>This is what great struggle with test</v>
<v Speaker 3>their character.</v>

1662
01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.120
<v Speaker 3>That along comes a new craze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Football,</v>

1663
01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:16.630
<v Speaker 3>a brutally violent game where young men</v>
<v Speaker 3>show a stadium full of fans,</v>

1664
01:16:16.631 --> 01:16:17.860
<v Speaker 3>just what they're made of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvard,</v>

1665
01:16:17.861 --> 01:16:18.581
<v Speaker 3>yale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>princeton,</v>

1666
01:16:18.581 --> 01:16:20.590
<v Speaker 3>penn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sons of the most powerful men in the</v>

1667
01:16:20.591 --> 01:16:23.650
<v Speaker 3>country are literally knocking</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves out to win these gladiatorial</v>

1668
01:16:23.651 --> 01:16:25.510
<v Speaker 3>battles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's when it came up.</v>

1669
01:16:25.511 --> 01:16:28.480
<v Speaker 3>And then the carlisle indian school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were beating the fuck out.</v>

1670
01:16:28.481 --> 01:16:29.320
<v Speaker 3>All the white dudes.</v>

1671
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:36.870
<v Speaker 3>Surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

1672
01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:38.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1673
01:16:38.891 --> 01:16:40.980
<v Speaker 3>And then I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they all assimilated.</v>

1674
01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:45.020
<v Speaker 3>I forget the plot of the rules came</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the indians kept beating every</v>

1675
01:16:45.450 --> 01:16:47.290
<v Speaker 3>to make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making a new rule and they all right,</v>

1676
01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:52.460
<v Speaker 3>going to change this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Native americans need to make a back.</v>

1677
01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:57.220
<v Speaker 3>They had a lot of cool ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we fucked them over by giving</v>

1678
01:16:57.221 --> 01:17:00.460
<v Speaker 3>them casinos to other towns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegas,</v>

1679
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:03.310
<v Speaker 3>I've got a small amount of native</v>
<v Speaker 3>american in me.</v>

1680
01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.840
<v Speaker 3>Can you get money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

1681
01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:06.220
<v Speaker 3>not a profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you need?</v>

1682
01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:09.170
<v Speaker 3>Like 16 percent to get money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need like a certain amount you can</v>

1683
01:17:09.171 --> 01:17:10.004
<v Speaker 3>get some cash.</v>

1684
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's even maybe less than that</v>

1685
01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:15.770
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or to qualify for whatever.</v>

1686
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:18.440
<v Speaker 2>I'll have To look into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be the worst thing you can do</v>

1687
01:17:18.441 --> 01:17:21.350
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people just tuck them away and this</v>

1688
01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:25.210
<v Speaker 2>little patch of land isolate them from</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else and you know,</v>

1689
01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.440
<v Speaker 2>they're watching the rest of the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed around them,</v>

1690
01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:30.110
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a strange way and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>americans,</v>

1691
01:17:30.111 --> 01:17:32.600
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're in some sort of a weird</v>

1692
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.230
<v Speaker 2>territory that they have ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 2>control over and then they started</v>

1693
01:17:36.231 --> 01:17:38.690
<v Speaker 2>having gambling there and doing whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck they want.</v>

1694
01:17:39.130 --> 01:17:43.130
<v Speaker 2>Very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in some ways like what are the</v>

1695
01:17:43.131 --> 01:17:45.110
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were the other options at the time?</v>

1696
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Giving them territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably pretty ugly optimism.</v>

1697
01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dark.</v>

1698
01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:53.480
<v Speaker 2>You really stop and think about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>genocide of the native americans in this</v>

1699
01:17:53.481 --> 01:17:56.000
<v Speaker 2>country and how that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how rarely that comes up and there's no</v>

1700
01:17:56.001 --> 01:17:56.660
<v Speaker 2>flag.</v>

1701
01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Which is really interesting when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1702
01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.590
<v Speaker 2>obviously there are some plaques,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are some nations,</v>

1703
01:18:00.591 --> 01:18:03.410
<v Speaker 2>but I mean there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one thing that represents our war</v>

1704
01:18:03.411 --> 01:18:04.260
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's no,</v>

1705
01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:07.160
<v Speaker 2>no offensive symbol other than like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>few sports teams.</v>

1706
01:18:07.161 --> 01:18:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the redskins are.</v>

1707
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.550
<v Speaker 2>The braves were both my high school and</v>
<v Speaker 2>college were both the warriors.</v>

1708
01:18:14.150 --> 01:18:19.130
<v Speaker 2>Warriors is not specific to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nationality or ethnicity.</v>

1709
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:20.390
<v Speaker 2>logo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Logo was,</v>

1710
01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:23.120
<v Speaker 2>you know know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird man.</v>

1711
01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:27.550
<v Speaker 2>It's real weird that the fact that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was only a couple of hundred years ago</v>

1712
01:18:27.551 --> 01:18:30.990
<v Speaker 2>is really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a blink of an eye.</v>

1713
01:18:31.690 --> 01:18:33.620
<v Speaker 2>How long do you think people are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live now?</v>

1714
01:18:33.790 --> 01:18:37.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking I'm good for 100 at least.</v>

1715
01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1716
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:40.400
<v Speaker 2>But you personally?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1717
01:18:40.401 --> 01:18:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I think you're probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look healthy,</v>

1718
01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:43.940
<v Speaker 2>but a kid born today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand years old.</v>

1719
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.020
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be able to read minds.</v>

1720
01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends also upon what it person</v>

1721
01:18:48.321 --> 01:18:51.920
<v Speaker 2>becomes because I have a feeling they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to come up with legs that are</v>

1722
01:18:51.921 --> 01:18:53.890
<v Speaker 2>artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that work way better than your legs.</v>

1723
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:58.740
<v Speaker 2>Like I have a bunch of friends that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fake hips or fake knees or you</v>

1724
01:18:58.741 --> 01:19:00.290
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've had surgery and they had a bunch</v>

1725
01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:03.350
<v Speaker 2>of stuff fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people that have had hip</v>

1726
01:19:03.351 --> 01:19:04.970
<v Speaker 2>replacements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe a dozen.</v>

1727
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:10.270
<v Speaker 2>So I've figured out that if I create</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough public information about me,</v>

1728
01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:14.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was enough times I'm recorded like</v>

1729
01:19:14.121 --> 01:19:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm being right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1730
01:19:15.801 --> 01:19:20.750
<v Speaker 2>enough of my writing is in the public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no video of me that after I die</v>

1731
01:19:20.751 --> 01:19:25.670
<v Speaker 2>I could be recreated and software almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>in full because you would have my,</v>

1732
01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:29.750
<v Speaker 2>everything from my personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my sense of humor,</v>

1733
01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:33.980
<v Speaker 2>my choice of words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some future program could just go to</v>

1734
01:19:33.981 --> 01:19:37.010
<v Speaker 2>the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>google my name and take all those</v>

1735
01:19:37.011 --> 01:19:42.011
<v Speaker 2>sources and bring together an actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical hologram that walks and talks</v>

1736
01:19:42.531 --> 01:19:45.140
<v Speaker 2>like me a hundred years after I'm dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What jamie,</v>

1737
01:19:45.141 --> 01:19:48.710
<v Speaker 2>you were just telling me about some</v>
<v Speaker 2>software that they've developed that you</v>

1738
01:19:48.711 --> 01:19:51.880
<v Speaker 2>can take someone's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone can say like,</v>

1739
01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:54.710
<v Speaker 2>I could make a statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott adams is a really cool guy and I</v>

1740
01:19:54.711 --> 01:19:58.760
<v Speaker 2>always love hanging out with them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can move the words all over the</v>

1741
01:19:58.761 --> 01:20:01.910
<v Speaker 2>place was where it's a jumbled sentence</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it doesn't make any sense.</v>

1742
01:20:01.911 --> 01:20:04.340
<v Speaker 2>And then change the inflection and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds perfect.</v>

1743
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:05.121
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to this.</v>

1744
01:20:05.121 --> 01:20:08.060
<v Speaker 2>We'll play some of it here called I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if</v>

1745
01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:08.893
<v Speaker 4>I can get</v>

1746
01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.090
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1747
01:20:12.091 --> 01:20:12.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1748
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:14.250
<v Speaker 3>I kiss my wife and my dogs</v>

1749
01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:21.120
<v Speaker 5>other dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1750
01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:25.800
<v Speaker 5>How can we let the dogs out who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who mIght not be a great example of it</v>

1751
01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:26.550
<v Speaker 5>was terrible.</v>

1752
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:27.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a five minute video where they</v>

1753
01:20:27.811 --> 01:20:30.630
<v Speaker 4>just think he's called like photoshop</v>
<v Speaker 4>for audio.</v>

1754
01:20:30.710 --> 01:20:31.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1755
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:35.220
<v Speaker 4>Like it's manipulating audio in a way</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people aren't used to or I've even</v>

1756
01:20:35.221 --> 01:20:38.700
<v Speaker 4>seen up until they've just shown this</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of demonstration.</v>

1757
01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:40.870
<v Speaker 3>So the point being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could automate this,</v>

1758
01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.960
<v Speaker 3>if you could put this inside some sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an artificial intelligence structure</v>

1759
01:20:43.961 --> 01:20:48.961
<v Speaker 3>that kneW when to inflect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when to have a question when to like,</v>

1760
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:51.460
<v Speaker 3>or maybe you will be a tech guy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking up,</v>

1761
01:20:51.461 --> 01:20:53.280
<v Speaker 3>speak up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Speak is right.</v>

1762
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:58.090
<v Speaker 3>I love up speak because it's so fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this weird thing that these tech</v>

1763
01:20:58.091 --> 01:21:01.420
<v Speaker 3>dorks do where they sort of talk in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>really weird,</v>

1764
01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:05.740
<v Speaker 3>unpredictable way and they all do it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically it makes you seem like you're</v>

1765
01:21:05.741 --> 01:21:09.850
<v Speaker 3>sensitive and intelligent and on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ball and it's a weird fucking little</v>

1766
01:21:09.851 --> 01:21:14.020
<v Speaker 3>sneaky thing that some of these tech</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys do where it takes you a while to</v>

1767
01:21:14.021 --> 01:21:14.441
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1768
01:21:14.441 --> 01:21:16.780
<v Speaker 3>you're not smart at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking crazy.</v>

1769
01:21:16.781 --> 01:21:18.850
<v Speaker 3>But you talk in ups speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1770
01:21:18.851 --> 01:21:21.880
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've decided to take on the persona</v>

1771
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:23.140
<v Speaker 3>of a tech person.</v>

1772
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:26.350
<v Speaker 3>Somebody is really into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in android,</v>

1773
01:21:26.351 --> 01:21:28.630
<v Speaker 3>android's the future and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start,</v>

1774
01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:31.900
<v Speaker 3>they have this weird thing that they do</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of each sentence.</v>

1775
01:21:31.901 --> 01:21:34.720
<v Speaker 3>They go up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure that exists outside of</v>

1776
01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.660
<v Speaker 3>Virginia or California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>silicone valley.</v>

1777
01:21:37.661 --> 01:21:39.850
<v Speaker 3>It's huge in silicone valley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more,</v>

1778
01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:43.120
<v Speaker 3>it's more prevalent in northern</v>
<v Speaker 3>California that it is in southern</v>

1779
01:21:43.121 --> 01:21:46.390
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like they're halfway like an</v>

1780
01:21:46.391 --> 01:21:51.391
<v Speaker 3>npr sort of a radio personality halfway</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and halfway a strip club dj.</v>

1781
01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:56.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like they have this thing going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's a fake voice and they're</v>

1782
01:21:56.891 --> 01:21:59.050
<v Speaker 3>talking about technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>

1783
01:21:59.051 --> 01:22:01.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to here now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going to hear that.</v>

1784
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll hear it.</v>

1785
01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:02.080
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

1786
01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:05.770
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you some audio of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of people that they</v>

1787
01:22:05.771 --> 01:22:09.340
<v Speaker 3>speak and it is an accent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same way in New York accent or a</v>

1788
01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:11.890
<v Speaker 3>boston accent is like you can recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1789
01:22:11.891 --> 01:22:13.030
<v Speaker 3>that's a tech dork.</v>

1790
01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:17.420
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a non original tech person</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's speaking in this weird there.</v>

1791
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:20.140
<v Speaker 3>You want people to understand that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a tech person,</v>

1792
01:22:20.290 --> 01:22:23.980
<v Speaker 3>so you're speaking in a literally a tech</v>
<v Speaker 3>accent,</v>

1793
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:28.600
<v Speaker 3>up speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might try that and it's really</v>

1794
01:22:28.601 --> 01:22:31.230
<v Speaker 3>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women can do it too.</v>

1795
01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:34.210
<v Speaker 3>It's super important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1796
01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:37.690
<v Speaker 3>like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost a woman up speak that you'll see</v>

1797
01:22:37.691 --> 01:22:42.190
<v Speaker 3>occasionally on daytime talk shows where</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a bunch of women will sit around</v>

1798
01:22:42.191 --> 01:22:45.340
<v Speaker 3>and they'll be on a show and the woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>or it's all audience,</v>

1799
01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:46.630
<v Speaker 3>the wwe women's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1800
01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:49.990
<v Speaker 3>the audience is all women and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>all women on the panel and then they're</v>

1801
01:22:49.991 --> 01:22:54.880
<v Speaker 3>cooking or they're talking about clothes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what the woman's up speak.</v>

1802
01:22:54.881 --> 01:22:58.840
<v Speaker 3>His sentences don't end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just sort of stopped talking.</v>

1803
01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever notice somebody who didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have any way to end a story?</v>

1804
01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:03.760
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would.</v>

1805
01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.590
<v Speaker 3>They would talk forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They keep going.</v>

1806
01:23:05.650 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 3>And then</v>

1807
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.850
<v Speaker 2>during the time of a early cell phones</v>
<v Speaker 2>when one person was talking,</v>

1808
01:23:09.851 --> 01:23:12.790
<v Speaker 2>the other person couldn't talk because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't realize it all the time,</v>

1809
01:23:12.791 --> 01:23:17.230
<v Speaker 2>but it really was one way communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And somebody would start and I would</v>

1810
01:23:17.231 --> 01:23:20.110
<v Speaker 2>start yelling into the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop stopped.</v>

1811
01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bang,</v>

1812
01:23:22.121 --> 01:23:22.661
<v Speaker 2>bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bang.</v>

1813
01:23:22.661 --> 01:23:24.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me in,</v>

1814
01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:25.190
<v Speaker 2>let me in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1815
01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:27.310
<v Speaker 2>with what I mean by sentences don't ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

1816
01:23:27.311 --> 01:23:30.850
<v Speaker 2>It's not that they don't stop talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that they don't have it.</v>

1817
01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:33.130
<v Speaker 2>Like if I said to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey scott,</v>

1818
01:23:33.131 --> 01:23:35.920
<v Speaker 2>it's 3:00,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should probably wrap this up in about</v>

1819
01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.510
<v Speaker 2>an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of that,</v>

1820
01:23:37.511 --> 01:23:38.800
<v Speaker 2>they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey scott,</v>

1821
01:23:38.801 --> 01:23:41.560
<v Speaker 2>it's 3:00.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should probably wrap this up in about</v>

1822
01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:44.200
<v Speaker 2>an hour and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then just keep going and then</v>

1823
01:23:44.201 --> 01:23:46.690
<v Speaker 2>someone else chimes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about 4:00?</v>

1824
01:23:46.691 --> 01:23:49.600
<v Speaker 2>It's 4:00 a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four o'clock is a good time.</v>

1825
01:23:49.601 --> 01:23:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Five o'clock is a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six o'clock is a good time.</v>

1826
01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:55.540
<v Speaker 2>what about seven?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we do it at seven slash 11 is fine.</v>

1827
01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:59.590
<v Speaker 2>We can definitely keep going and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>no end.</v>

1828
01:23:59.830 --> 01:24:01.810
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my laptop.</v>

1829
01:24:01.811 --> 01:24:04.600
<v Speaker 2>My laptop is black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they hear it themselves?</v>

1830
01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:07.150
<v Speaker 2>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love to talk to get together.</v>

1831
01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that if you meet somebody</v>

1832
01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:12.520
<v Speaker 2>who has heard this podcast and they talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that normally,</v>

1833
01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:15.240
<v Speaker 2>would they be unable to talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1834
01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:16.990
<v Speaker 2>it'd be to self coach now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be fine,</v>

1835
01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.330
<v Speaker 2>they'd say he's a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also</v>

1836
01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:22.720
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dick.</v>

1837
01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1838
01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:25.900
<v Speaker 2>I didn't give the best example of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>either,</v>

1839
01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:27.330
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what it is,</v>

1840
01:24:27.331 --> 01:24:29.680
<v Speaker 2>is that's how they enjoy talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're,</v>

1841
01:24:29.681 --> 01:24:32.950
<v Speaker 2>they've had to edit their conversations</v>
<v Speaker 2>because men get tired quicker.</v>

1842
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:35.170
<v Speaker 2>We just don't want to talk as much about</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain stuff.</v>

1843
01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Like we'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus christ,</v>

1844
01:24:36.491 --> 01:24:38.590
<v Speaker 2>get on with the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finish it.</v>

1845
01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:41.200
<v Speaker 2>When does the story end?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But women get together.</v>

1846
01:24:41.650 --> 01:24:43.300
<v Speaker 2>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can just keep going.</v>

1847
01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:45.310
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them can you reminded me of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1848
01:24:45.311 --> 01:24:49.030
<v Speaker 2>the worst advice anybody ever gave his</v>
<v Speaker 2>be natural.</v>

1849
01:24:49.330 --> 01:24:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Be yourself because what the hell does</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mean?</v>

1850
01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I were myself,</v>

1851
01:24:54.581 --> 01:24:55.530
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1852
01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.270
<v Speaker 2>sitting here and make it masturbating</v>
<v Speaker 2>and really,</v>

1853
01:24:59.170 --> 01:25:01.220
<v Speaker 2>well maybe not right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1854
01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:04.290
<v Speaker 2>that was a terrible example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes let's go back,</v>

1855
01:25:04.930 --> 01:25:07.390
<v Speaker 2>get rid of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would be used sometimes.</v>

1856
01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:08.253
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1857
01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:11.500
<v Speaker 2>that is yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like yourself varies depending</v>

1858
01:25:11.501 --> 01:25:13.870
<v Speaker 2>upon your company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending upon the environment,</v>

1859
01:25:13.871 --> 01:25:17.080
<v Speaker 2>depending upon the circumstances were</v>
<v Speaker 2>all acting all the time.</v>

1860
01:25:17.370 --> 01:25:19.390
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're adapting to every Situation.</v>

1861
01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you and you also want to be</v>

1862
01:25:21.341 --> 01:25:23.740
<v Speaker 2>different sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not even necessarily an act.</v>

1863
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.761
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1864
01:25:24.761 --> 01:25:25.521
<v Speaker 2>someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1865
01:25:25.521 --> 01:25:26.231
<v Speaker 2>he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show me.</v>

1866
01:25:26.231 --> 01:25:28.000
<v Speaker 2>Show me that fucking crazy handstand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did.</v>

1867
01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really does not me right now.</v>

1868
01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1869
01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're always adapting to the</v>

1870
01:25:33.941 --> 01:25:34.990
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1871
01:25:34.991 --> 01:25:36.730
<v Speaker 2>But there's women that are like men too</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that way.</v>

1872
01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:39.670
<v Speaker 2>The women want other women to shut the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck up and they want men to shut the</v>

1873
01:25:39.671 --> 01:25:41.740
<v Speaker 2>fuck up to like I like got damaged</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1874
01:25:41.741 --> 01:25:44.770
<v Speaker 2>They're long ass boring stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily genDer specific,</v>

1875
01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:48.970
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to be like women on talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows during the day that are Cooking.</v>

1876
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever have people who can't tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they've gone on too long?</v>

1877
01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe me right there.</v>

1878
01:25:58.590 --> 01:26:02.350
<v Speaker 2>And you look at them and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they not know?</v>

1879
01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving the signals</v>

1880

<v Speaker 1>of stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1881
01:26:05.530 --> 01:26:09.320
<v Speaker 1>in the corporate world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you always have a pen in your</v>

1882
01:26:09.321 --> 01:26:11.180
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Somebody came into your cubicle and</v>

1883
01:26:11.181 --> 01:26:14.580
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't put the pen down so you</v>

1884
01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:17.330
<v Speaker 1>turn toward them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you keep the pen in your hand to</v>

1885
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:19.830
<v Speaker 1>signal them that you're there for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1886
01:26:19.870 --> 01:26:21.680

<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I like that term</v>

1920
01:27:20.590 --> 01:27:22.050
<v Speaker 3>that we were talking about that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other day,</v>

1921
01:27:22.051 --> 01:27:24.270
<v Speaker 3>hillary for prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember when we were saying rape?</v>

1922
01:27:24.271 --> 01:27:26.970
<v Speaker 3>Melania was actually a hashtag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but hillary for prison wasn't.</v>

1923
01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:30.060
<v Speaker 3>That's not what people were saying was</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were saying was they were shadow</v>

1924
01:27:30.061 --> 01:27:34.920
<v Speaker 3>banning that hillary for prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag meaning if You put hashtag</v>

1925
01:27:34.921 --> 01:27:37.080
<v Speaker 3>hillary for prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone could search it and find it,</v>

1926
01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:39.420
<v Speaker 3>but if you put it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't show up in other people's</v>

1927
01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:41.220
<v Speaker 3>feeds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true though.</v>

1928
01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:42.540
<v Speaker 3>Has that been proven?</v>

1929
01:27:43.190 --> 01:27:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a real tough time with what's</v>

1930
01:27:45.991 --> 01:27:49.680
<v Speaker 1>proven because lots of people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>sending me my own stuff and saying,</v>

1931
01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:52.960

<v Speaker 1>banned because look at this page and</v>

1932

<v Speaker 1>and I always look at them and I go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm not really a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1934

<v Speaker 3>Don't get on and start shitting on</v>

<v Speaker 3>goof,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and then you sit there and you watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>your timeline.</v>

1943
01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.211
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1946
01:28:21.250 --> 01:28:23.200
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could find out yourself.</v>

1947
01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:27.340
<v Speaker 3>You could tweet from another computer as</v>
<v Speaker 3>scott adam says,</v>

01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:28.211
<v Speaker 3>so you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scott.</v>

1949
01:28:28.211 --> 01:28:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Adam says you're followIng you on</v>
<v Speaker 3>another computer that's in a different</v>

1950
01:28:32.291 --> 01:28:34.840
<v Speaker 3>account and you're such,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but have you done that?</v>

1951
01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:36.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying that other people have</v>

1952
01:28:36.851 --> 01:28:38.830
<v Speaker 1>done that and they sent me the</v>
<v Speaker 1>screenshot,</v>

1953
01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.270
<v Speaker 3>but when I look at her crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just want to talk to you,</v>

1954
01:28:41.271 --> 01:28:42.530
<v Speaker 3>scott.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to be your friend.</v>

1955
01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:44.040
<v Speaker 3>They want to talk to you when you're on</v>
<v Speaker 3>your cell phone.</v>

1956
01:28:44.041 --> 01:28:45.110
<v Speaker 3>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love gilbert.</v>

1957
01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.120
<v Speaker 3>Who he talked to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't fuck it.</v>

1958
01:28:47.121 --> 01:28:47.954
<v Speaker 3>I'm right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1959
01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:50.240
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you try it yourself?</v>

1960
01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I wasn't that curious.</v>

1961
01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:57.050
<v Speaker 3>Come on and he talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be curious.</v>

1962
01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.020
<v Speaker 3>I kind of liked being shadow banned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you like being shadow banned or you</v>

1963
01:29:00.021 --> 01:29:01.830
<v Speaker 3>liked the idea of you being shadow</v>
<v Speaker 3>bands?</v>

1964
01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:04.370
<v Speaker 3>I liked that definitive proof that your</v>
<v Speaker 3>shadow bands I liked,</v>

1965
01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:08.820
<v Speaker 3>I liked the thought that I might be so</v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous to the minds of America that</v>

1966
01:29:08.821 --> 01:29:13.380
<v Speaker 3>there's a major corporation who is</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually making a conscious decision to</v>

1967
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:17.130
<v Speaker 3>say who the americas had a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>too much of this guy.</v>

1968
01:29:17.410 --> 01:29:21.180
<v Speaker 3>So let's dial it back a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well of like that if twitter didn't have</v>

1969
01:29:21.181 --> 01:29:25.440
<v Speaker 3>a history of banning people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1970
01:29:25.441 --> 01:29:27.690
<v Speaker 3>like the milo thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>milo yiannopoulos,</v>

1971
01:29:27.691 --> 01:29:32.430
<v Speaker 3>that was a big mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big mistake because they didn't ban them</v>

1972
01:29:32.431 --> 01:29:34.590
<v Speaker 3>for anything that like you could like</v>
<v Speaker 3>put your finger on.</v>

1973
01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:37.920
<v Speaker 3>TheY banned them for influence and other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were saying mean things,</v>

1974
01:29:37.921 --> 01:29:39.690
<v Speaker 3>but you looked at the stuff that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually said,</v>

1975
01:29:40.110 --> 01:29:41.400
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't ban them for that.</v>

1976
01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.200
<v Speaker 3>That's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not fair.</v>

1977
01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:45.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly not compared to everything</v>

1978
01:29:45.661 --> 01:29:48.060
<v Speaker 3>else that's on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even compared to the things that</v>

1979
01:29:48.061 --> 01:29:50.100
<v Speaker 3>leslie jones wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1980
01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:51.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1981
01:29:51.210 --> 01:29:56.100
<v Speaker 3>the person that he was supposedly</v>
<v Speaker 3>attacking and what he was doing was he</v>

1982
01:29:56.101 --> 01:29:59.280
<v Speaker 3>was targeting a piece of art and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>critiqued it very harshly,</v>

1983
01:29:59.610 --> 01:30:04.380
<v Speaker 3>but that's what he does and he's very</v>
<v Speaker 3>wise with his choice of words is very</v>

1984
01:30:04.381 --> 01:30:08.070
<v Speaker 3>snippy and bitchy and that's his persona</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what he's put together.</v>

1985
01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:11.190
<v Speaker 3>He's a lovely guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've had them on the podcast a</v>

1986
01:30:11.191 --> 01:30:12.600
<v Speaker 3>couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy his company.</v>

1987
01:30:12.601 --> 01:30:14.900
<v Speaker 3>He's a fun guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but god damned.</v>

1988
01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:18.090
<v Speaker 3>People get pissed off and then it's kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of hilarious.</v>

1989
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:20.970
<v Speaker 3>And so when that whole thing went down</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the leslie jones things,</v>

1990
01:30:21.010 --> 01:30:24.760
<v Speaker 3>and I've absolutely didn't agree with</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the people that were being mean</v>

1991
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:28.380
<v Speaker 3>insulting to leslie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's kind of what happens if you</v>

1992
01:30:28.381 --> 01:30:30.090
<v Speaker 3>put yourself out there with a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 3>art,</v>

1993
01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.560
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people don't like.</v>

1994
01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:35.040
<v Speaker 3>And all he did was saY that they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>all ugly,</v>

1995
01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:37.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was saying that it's a bad feminist</v>

1996
01:30:37.891 --> 01:30:41.640
<v Speaker 3>film because all the men are buffoons</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the women are saving the world.</v>

1997
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.230
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's preposterous.</v>

1998
01:30:43.231 --> 01:30:44.670
<v Speaker 3>It's sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not good.</v>

1999
01:30:44.671 --> 01:30:47.400
<v Speaker 3>And the women are all gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what he said and you know,</v>

2000
01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:50.610
<v Speaker 3>for that was that the last part was all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the trouble.</v>

2001
01:30:51.090 --> 01:30:52.080
<v Speaker 3>Well it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2002
01:30:52.110 --> 01:30:53.820
<v Speaker 3>the fact that he was saying they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>unattractive.</v>

2003
01:30:53.850 --> 01:30:56.070
<v Speaker 3>He was saying that not just to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitchy,</v>

2004
01:30:56.071 --> 01:30:58.650
<v Speaker 3>but also at a point it was like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he made a point,</v>

2005
01:30:58.910 --> 01:31:01.290
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've decided lee picked people that</v>

2006
01:31:01.291 --> 01:31:05.400
<v Speaker 3>were unattractive to make this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>feminist point of these overweight women</v>

2007
01:31:05.401 --> 01:31:08.180
<v Speaker 3>can save the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That they're the ones who are gonna like</v>

2008
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:11.010
<v Speaker 3>they're targeting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why all the men are buffoons.</v>

2009
01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:14.370
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of revenge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the idea being,</v>

2010
01:31:14.371 --> 01:31:17.550
<v Speaker 3>if you wanted to look at it broadly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea being that these are the type</v>

2011
01:31:17.551 --> 01:31:19.890
<v Speaker 3>of women that the guy like the thor</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2012
01:31:19.891 --> 01:31:20.724
<v Speaker 3>what's his name?</v>

2013
01:31:20.970 --> 01:31:23.080
<v Speaker 3>the guy who was in that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that really handsome fellow that plays</v>

2014
01:31:23.081 --> 01:31:25.530
<v Speaker 3>thor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chris quits name.</v>

2015
01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Now chris is super spy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Captain american to see liam hemsworth.</v>

2016
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Is that the grams worth comes worth</v>
<v Speaker 3>chris hemsworth,</v>

2017
01:31:31.561 --> 01:31:32.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of them.</v>

2018
01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:33.990
<v Speaker 3>Am I right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or is it chris?</v>

2019
01:31:33.991 --> 01:31:36.750
<v Speaker 3>The guy who plays captain America</v>
<v Speaker 3>hemsworth.</v>

2020
01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:38.210
<v Speaker 3>Let's just call them thor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2021
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:40.560
<v Speaker 3>Doors impossibly beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful man.</v>

2022
01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:43.800
<v Speaker 3>It's super handsome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big fucking perfect body.</v>

2023
01:31:44.130 --> 01:31:46.650
<v Speaker 3>And of course in this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking moron.</v>

2024
01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:49.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean he is the dumbest guy that's ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>walked the face of the planet.</v>

2025
01:31:49.501 --> 01:31:52.530
<v Speaker 3>He's preposterously dm and then becomes</v>
<v Speaker 3>the villain at the end.</v>

2026
01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:57.740
<v Speaker 3>So he represents this unattainable goal</v>
<v Speaker 3>of like a having this gigantic beautiful</v>

2027
01:31:58.681 --> 01:32:01.990
<v Speaker 3>man be attracted to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they've turned him in this complete</v>

2028
01:32:01.991 --> 01:32:05.200
<v Speaker 3>retard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if this was a woman in a movie,</v>

2029
01:32:05.201 --> 01:32:07.660
<v Speaker 3>it would be one of the most offensive</v>
<v Speaker 3>portrayals of a woman ever.</v>

2030
01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.940
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure it's been done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's been done right.</v>

2031
01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:12.040
<v Speaker 3>Especially like in the old days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2032
01:32:12.041 --> 01:32:15.160
<v Speaker 3>there was how many fucking dopey</v>
<v Speaker 3>secretary roles were there in the world,</v>

2033
01:32:15.161 --> 01:32:18.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he was that the male caricature of</v>

2034
01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:20.830
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's not a single other male in</v>

2035
01:32:20.831 --> 01:32:22.960
<v Speaker 3>the movie that wasn't a complete</v>
<v Speaker 3>buffoon.</v>

2036
01:32:23.230 --> 01:32:26.800
<v Speaker 3>Every male iS a failure and ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets killed and dies.</v>

2037
01:32:27.010 --> 01:32:29.980
<v Speaker 3>Every woman's saves the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was my lowest point.</v>

2038
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:34.900
<v Speaker 1>So in most forms of entertainment you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need the dumb one and the smart one,</v>

2039
01:32:34.901 --> 01:32:35.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always going to be that</v>

2040
01:32:35.921 --> 01:32:36.754
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2041
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:41.910
<v Speaker 1>And in earlier times there were other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people you could poke fun at and society</v>

2042
01:32:42.071 --> 01:32:42.701
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

2043
01:32:42.701 --> 01:32:43.960
<v Speaker 1>we make fun of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2044
01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:44.630
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2045
01:32:44.630 --> 01:32:49.630
<v Speaker 1>the wife was the dumb one in the fifties</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now some of it is just what target</v>

2046
01:32:51.491 --> 01:32:53.730
<v Speaker 1>can you get away with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

2047
01:32:53.770 --> 01:32:55.180
<v Speaker 1>there's a little bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2048
01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:58.600
<v Speaker 1>you know who's a soft target,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's going to complain and men are</v>

2049
01:32:58.601 --> 01:32:59.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2050
01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:01.840
<v Speaker 1>the current target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at commercials,</v>

2051
01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:07.180
<v Speaker 1>almost all the commercials are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The woman is the smart one in the man.</v>

2052
01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Did something stupid that she had to fix</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2053
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Every sitcom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every sitcom.</v>

2054
01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:11.990
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in the fifties,</v>

2055
01:33:11.991 --> 01:33:16.100
<v Speaker 3>that was the case like the honeymooners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ralph kramden was a fucking moron.</v>

2056
01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:18.080
<v Speaker 3>His wife has one is always keeping them</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's threatening to beat her.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2062
01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:29.330
<v Speaker 3>That was true for the honeymooners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2063
01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:32.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at any couples sort of comedy,</v>

2064
01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:35.000
<v Speaker 3>the man is a buffoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Married with children.</v>

2065
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:38.860
<v Speaker 3>Pegs always want sex is all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to get away from her.</v>

2066
01:33:38.861 --> 01:33:40.940
<v Speaker 3>He hates his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything falls apart on him.</v>

2067
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:44.150
<v Speaker 3>His daughter's acting like a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>hussy,</v>

2068
01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:45.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the whole thing.</v>

2069
01:33:45.921 --> 01:33:47.540
<v Speaker 3>This poor guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his life's falling apart.</v>

2070
01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:49.310
<v Speaker 3>The guys never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2071
01:33:50.150 --> 01:33:52.130
<v Speaker 3>All those movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy's a buffoon and all those</v>

2072
01:33:52.131 --> 01:33:53.420
<v Speaker 3>sitcoms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy's a buffoon.</v>

2073
01:33:53.421 --> 01:33:54.530
<v Speaker 3>That's what people like to see.</v>

2074
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2075
01:33:57.161 --> 01:34:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at elvis right behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's different animal baby.</v>

2076
01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on in.</v>

2077
01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:03.880
<v Speaker 1>So there were a lot of movies where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

2078
01:34:03.881 --> 01:34:05.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frank sinatra,</v>

2079
01:34:05.690 --> 01:34:07.780
<v Speaker 1>charles bronson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have to go back further where,</v>

2080
01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:11.530
<v Speaker 1>where the man was the competent one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman was always losing her high</v>

2081
01:34:11.531 --> 01:34:12.341
<v Speaker 1>hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>OH,</v>

2082
01:34:12.341 --> 01:34:15.940
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of movies like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in sitcoms and the sitcom world and</v>

2083
01:34:15.941 --> 01:34:17.880
<v Speaker 1>the comedy world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much always the men's.</v>

2084
01:34:17.890 --> 01:34:19.420
<v Speaker 1>A man's phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2085
01:34:19.450 --> 01:34:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that's fair to say for a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2086
01:34:22.210 --> 01:34:23.500
<v Speaker 1>king of queens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another one,</v>

2087
01:34:23.890 --> 01:34:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Kevin James is always ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His wife always had to figure everything</v>

2088
01:34:27.041 --> 01:34:28.420
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Was ridiculous.</v>

2089
01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:32.380
<v Speaker 1>But how did you get this hot wife?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's on tv.</v>

2090
01:34:34.830 --> 01:34:37.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a.</v>

2091
01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:39.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going back to the twitter thing.</v>

2092
01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:42.010
<v Speaker 3>This is the problem with censoring</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2093
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:44.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that if you don't like what they</v>

2094
01:34:44.741 --> 01:34:45.880
<v Speaker 3>stand for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2095
01:34:45.881 --> 01:34:49.210
<v Speaker 3>you're not really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they were looking for the reason to</v>

2096
01:34:49.211 --> 01:34:51.820
<v Speaker 3>pull the plug on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a good one.</v>

2097
01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:56.500
<v Speaker 3>So it left people like what that like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that him saying that.</v>

2098
01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:59.870
<v Speaker 3>And then when you pull up things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>she has said about white people that she</v>

2099
01:34:59.871 --> 01:35:02.430
<v Speaker 3>has said about other ethnicities and</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the,</v>

2100
01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:06.230
<v Speaker 3>she's like literally said get someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like someone tweeted something matter.</v>

2101
01:35:06.370 --> 01:35:09.470
<v Speaker 3>She was telling people to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like this targeted harassment,</v>

2102
01:35:09.471 --> 01:35:11.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that is like actual targeted</v>

2103
01:35:11.811 --> 01:35:15.890
<v Speaker 3>harassment and the idea that she's doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in revenge for someone coming after</v>

2104
01:35:15.891 --> 01:35:17.150
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand,</v>

2105
01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:21.200
<v Speaker 3>but in the position that she's at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she's a huge celebrity for her to</v>

2106
01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:23.390
<v Speaker 3>actively say go get this person.</v>

2107
01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:26.600
<v Speaker 3>Like that is the clearest example you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever going to see of targeted</v>

2108
01:35:26.601 --> 01:35:29.600
<v Speaker 3>harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if that doesn't get punished in any</v>

2109
01:35:29.601 --> 01:35:30.434
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shape or form,</v>

2110
01:35:30.670 --> 01:35:33.410
<v Speaker 3>like you got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why is it because she's female is</v>

2111
01:35:33.411 --> 01:35:35.900
<v Speaker 3>because she's black?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a combination of those things is</v>

2112
01:35:35.901 --> 01:35:40.901
<v Speaker 3>because she represents what you think is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like liberal progressive mindset and</v>

2113
01:35:41.241 --> 01:35:45.890
<v Speaker 3>then he represents this all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people are terrified of and hate.</v>

2114
01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:49.730
<v Speaker 3>He represents the gamer gate which gave</v>
<v Speaker 3>birth to the alt right,</v>

2115
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:52.250
<v Speaker 3>like gamergate allowed people to realize</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2116
01:35:52.251 --> 01:35:54.050
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's actually some intelligent people</v>

2117
01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:57.290
<v Speaker 3>that are tired of all this bullshit that</v>
<v Speaker 3>these feminists are trying to push down</v>

2118
01:35:57.291 --> 01:36:00.140
<v Speaker 3>our throats and intelligent people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are coming together and go,</v>

2119
01:36:00.141 --> 01:36:02.120
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>laura croft is not the fucking bane of</v>

2120
01:36:02.121 --> 01:36:05.350
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to watch her run around with</v>

2121
01:36:05.351 --> 01:36:06.230
<v Speaker 3>her tits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jiggling,</v>

2122
01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:07.310
<v Speaker 3>shoot guns at things.</v>

2123
01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:09.770
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean you hate women just</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't.</v>

2124
01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and women were playing that game too anD</v>

2125
01:36:11.841 --> 01:36:16.520
<v Speaker 3>saying the same thing and this portrayal</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these people as being these ugly</v>

2126
01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:18.170
<v Speaker 3>massage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just monsters.</v>

2127
01:36:18.230 --> 01:36:22.490
<v Speaker 3>The backlash of that is what gave birth</v>
<v Speaker 3>to gamergate and a loT of gamergate was</v>

2128
01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:24.770
<v Speaker 3>harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>targeted harassment of women.</v>

2129
01:36:24.771 --> 01:36:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Horrible stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2130
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.940
<v Speaker 3>But I think as you were saying when it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

2131
01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:29.420
<v Speaker 3>when you're talking about trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>supporters,</v>

2132
01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:32.390
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain percentage of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump supporters that probably are</v>

2133
01:36:32.391 --> 01:36:34.910
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean they all are like,</v>

2134
01:36:34.911 --> 01:36:36.350
<v Speaker 3>what is the number?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it two percent?</v>

2135
01:36:36.351 --> 01:36:38.360
<v Speaker 3>Is at four percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain percent of the</v>

2136
01:36:38.370 --> 01:36:40.910
<v Speaker 3>probably absolute misogynist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that number?</v>

2137
01:36:40.911 --> 01:36:43.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that number is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also some other people in</v>

2138
01:36:43.341 --> 01:36:45.320
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There has to be that a reasonable.</v>

2139
01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:48.860
<v Speaker 3>Because if you look at the number of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that voted for obama and you look</v>

2140
01:36:48.861 --> 01:36:50.360
<v Speaker 3>at the number of people that voted for</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>

2141
01:36:50.910 --> 01:36:53.250
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those people at the same people</v>
<v Speaker 1>will actually,</v>

2142
01:36:53.251 --> 01:36:56.070
<v Speaker 1>if you look at romney's vote compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>

2143
01:36:56.071 --> 01:36:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I think ron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trump did better in most ethnic</v>

2144
01:36:59.491 --> 01:37:00.870
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes he did.</v>

2145
01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Just across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't trust that white dude.</v>

2146
01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:04.290
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what was the,</v>

2147
01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:07.500
<v Speaker 1>what was the problem with romney?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't have the policies they</v>

2148
01:37:07.501 --> 01:37:08.430
<v Speaker 1>wanted to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2149
01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:11.070
<v Speaker 1>it was also the mormon thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2150
01:37:11.071 --> 01:37:12.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was also the mormon thing.</v>

2151
01:37:12.481 --> 01:37:14.640
<v Speaker 1>But the mormon thing was pretty big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2152
01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2153
01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:20.660
<v Speaker 1>he believes one of the wackiest strains</v>
<v Speaker 1>of christianity would even call it</v>

2154
01:37:21.511 --> 01:37:22.530
<v Speaker 1>christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2155
01:37:22.531 --> 01:37:24.630
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know which parts of it.</v>

2156
01:37:24.631 --> 01:37:26.190
<v Speaker 1>He believes literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2157
01:37:26.191 --> 01:37:28.920
<v Speaker 1>we know that his dad was actually born</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Mexico.</v>

2158
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the whole story about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2159
01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to school you scott,</v>

2160
01:37:33.010 --> 01:37:34.620
<v Speaker 3>because this is wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please do.</v>

2161
01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:39.060
<v Speaker 3>Mitt romney comes from a faction of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mormons that were so hardcore that when</v>

2162
01:37:39.061 --> 01:37:41.740
<v Speaker 3>the United States banned polygamy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went,</v>

2163
01:37:41.741 --> 01:37:43.530
<v Speaker 3>we'll fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're moving to Mexico.</v>

2164
01:37:43.710 --> 01:37:46.650
<v Speaker 3>so they moved to Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So mitt romney's dad could never be the</v>

2165
01:37:46.651 --> 01:37:49.230
<v Speaker 3>president United States because he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>born in Mexico.</v>

2166
01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:53.850
<v Speaker 3>It was a mexican citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have these giant compounds and they</v>

2167
01:37:53.851 --> 01:37:58.650
<v Speaker 3>have to fight off the drug and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than one gigantic compound owned by</v>

2168
01:37:58.651 --> 01:38:03.651
<v Speaker 3>mormons in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They literally have carved out their own</v>

2169
01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:08.640
<v Speaker 3>camps down there and they're armed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did as vice piece on them where</v>

2170
01:38:08.641 --> 01:38:10.830
<v Speaker 3>they interviewed them and went over</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and talked about it,</v>

2171
01:38:10.831 --> 01:38:15.660
<v Speaker 3>and that is the whole reason why mitt</v>
<v Speaker 3>romney's mommy's dad's mexican.</v>

2172
01:38:15.930 --> 01:38:17.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean literally mexican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>born in Mexico,</v>

2173
01:38:17.821 --> 01:38:19.940
<v Speaker 3>mexican citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll look at that.</v>

2174
01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:23.640
<v Speaker 3>Mitt romney's mexican roots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His father was born in Mexico and could</v>

2175
01:38:23.641 --> 01:38:26.160
<v Speaker 3>choose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could choose dual citizenship.</v>

2176
01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:28.390
<v Speaker 3>That is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2177
01:38:28.391 --> 01:38:31.340
<v Speaker 3>How did I noT know that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did you not know that matters?</v>

2178
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.891
<v Speaker 3>Anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2179
01:38:31.891 --> 01:38:33.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm obsesseD with mormons,</v>

2180
01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:37.410
<v Speaker 3>so that's how I found out about it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessed for a long time.</v>

2181
01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:41.160
<v Speaker 3>So did you do The deep dive and look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff that they believe in?</v>

2182
01:38:41.190 --> 01:38:42.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2183
01:38:42.170 --> 01:38:45.030
<v Speaker 3>The seer stone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Joseph Smith in 18,</v>

2184
01:38:45.031 --> 01:38:49.260
<v Speaker 3>12 found magic tablets that were the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last work of jesus and only he could</v>

2185
01:38:49.261 --> 01:38:53.160
<v Speaker 3>read him because he had a magic rock and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like 14 at the time,</v>

2186
01:38:53.161 --> 01:38:56.550
<v Speaker 3>which is fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this happened when he was 14.</v>

2187
01:38:56.551 --> 01:39:00.660
<v Speaker 3>This is when he first concocted this</v>
<v Speaker 3>goofy ass story apparently where he</v>

2188
01:39:00.661 --> 01:39:03.150
<v Speaker 3>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was fairly common for people to come</v>

2189
01:39:03.151 --> 01:39:05.940
<v Speaker 3>up with this kind of calm.</v>

2190
01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.021
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2191
01:39:07.021 --> 01:39:09.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like the only one doing this.</v>

2192
01:39:09.361 --> 01:39:12.060
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read that somewhere is just stuck.</v>

2193
01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:13.260
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>my sources.</v>

2194
01:39:13.261 --> 01:39:15.780
<v Speaker 3>I read that somewhere and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>misremembered it now,</v>

2195
01:39:15.781 --> 01:39:18.810
<v Speaker 3>so I'll say it in public because that</v>
<v Speaker 3>settles pretty authoritative thing about</v>

2196
01:39:18.811 --> 01:39:21.090
<v Speaker 3>mormons though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're really nice people.</v>

2197
01:39:21.170 --> 01:39:22.530
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like a lot of mormons.</v>

2198
01:39:22.650 --> 01:39:24.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm frienDs with quite a few more</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

2199
01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:29.070
<v Speaker 3>I know a bunch of them and like in</v>
<v Speaker 3>general they promote a lot of</v>

2200
01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:31.230
<v Speaker 3>camaraderie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a loT of community.</v>

2201
01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:34.200
<v Speaker 3>They're very friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people like in the mormon church,</v>

2202
01:39:34.201 --> 01:39:36.390
<v Speaker 3>like the friends that I know that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>mormons,</v>

2203
01:39:36.391 --> 01:39:39.240
<v Speaker 3>they go to church on a regular basis and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like this community</v>

2204
01:39:39.241 --> 01:39:42.660
<v Speaker 3>gathering of super polite people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>agree to be super polite.</v>

2205
01:39:42.730 --> 01:39:45.450
<v Speaker 3>I've said the same thing and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know if it's because they don't drink</v>

2206
01:39:45.451 --> 01:39:50.190
<v Speaker 3>and don't have coffee or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think I've ever met a</v>

2207
01:39:50.191 --> 01:39:51.600
<v Speaker 3>mormon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't really like.</v>

2208
01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:53.820
<v Speaker 3>they're nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just all seem great.</v>

2209
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.290
<v Speaker 3>Just almost like it's okay to believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>wacky shit if it works for you.</v>

2210
01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:00.930
<v Speaker 3>I've never met one that really believed</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2211
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:02.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the deeper stuff.</v>

2212
01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh my friends wear the underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seriously.</v>

2213
01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:07.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to wear the underwear,</v>

2214
01:40:07.470 --> 01:40:09.570
<v Speaker 3>but that's not a belief so much as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>customer,</v>

2215
01:40:09.571 --> 01:40:11.280
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2216
01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:12.810
<v Speaker 3>Well they're a little hypocritical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2217
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:15.450
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not allowed to drink coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this do drinks,</v>

2218
01:40:15.451 --> 01:40:16.800
<v Speaker 3>energy drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>monsters,</v>

2219
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:20.610
<v Speaker 3>those giant ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pounds those things and you know,</v>

2220
01:40:20.611 --> 01:40:23.340
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to do drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can get away with it.</v>

2221
01:40:23.341 --> 01:40:25.710
<v Speaker 3>If the doctor prescribes the xanax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed to take that</v>

2222
01:40:27.330 --> 01:40:29.640
<v Speaker 3>because it's not in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not any of their books.</v>

2223
01:40:29.641 --> 01:40:32.730
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have xanax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Xanax is a loophole.</v>

2224
01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:34.500
<v Speaker 3>You just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't pound booze.</v>

2225
01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:37.290
<v Speaker 3>So he just fucking pop pills and freak</v>
<v Speaker 3>out all day.</v>

2226
01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:40.440
<v Speaker 3>That was a good compromise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good.</v>

2227
01:40:40.441 --> 01:40:41.550
<v Speaker 3>Religion is flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2228
01:40:41.551 --> 01:40:44.010
<v Speaker 3>they're nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're really nice people like,</v>

2229
01:40:44.011 --> 01:40:45.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fan of the mormon people.</v>

2230
01:40:45.751 --> 01:40:48.240
<v Speaker 3>Like in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what they believe is nonsense,</v>

2231
01:40:48.241 --> 01:40:50.400
<v Speaker 3>but maybe they don't really believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2232
01:40:50.401 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said that I've talked to one who</v>

2233
01:40:53.981 --> 01:40:58.450
<v Speaker 3>actually believed the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stuff that's just be.</v>

2234
01:40:58.510 --> 01:41:02.410
<v Speaker 3>They enjoy the community aspect of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the bonding of it and they believe</v>

2235
01:41:02.411 --> 01:41:05.290
<v Speaker 3>in god and maybe they just let all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>other stuff slide.</v>

2236
01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:08.170
<v Speaker 3>That's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That feels like it.</v>

2237
01:41:08.250 --> 01:41:09.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it feels like,</v>

2238
01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:10.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they die,</v>

2239
01:41:10.361 --> 01:41:13.990
<v Speaker 3>they get their own planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a perk.</v>

2240
01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:15.730
<v Speaker 3>You get a whole planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

2241
01:41:15.731 --> 01:41:17.620
<v Speaker 3>I die if I die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

2242
01:41:17.621 --> 01:41:20.030
<v Speaker 3>I get what she had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2243
01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:21.370
<v Speaker 3>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I decomposed.</v>

2244
01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:24.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get you in tight with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mormons and you're going to get a planet</v>

2245
01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:25.443
<v Speaker 3>because I like you.</v>

2246
01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:27.550
<v Speaker 3>If you're seeing the osman brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2247
01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:29.140
<v Speaker 3>album where they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2248
01:41:29.141 --> 01:41:33.490
<v Speaker 3>they all have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's named after the planet that you</v>

2249
01:41:33.491 --> 01:41:36.280
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is the or named after</v>

2250
01:41:36.281 --> 01:41:39.400
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing that they believe that makes</v>

2251
01:41:39.401 --> 01:41:42.040
<v Speaker 3>you get all these planets like this</v>
<v Speaker 3>place that you go,</v>

2252
01:41:42.041 --> 01:41:44.830
<v Speaker 3>you get your own planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the osman album,</v>

2253
01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:46.990
<v Speaker 3>the osbourne family album,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever the fuck it is,</v>

2254
01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:51.070
<v Speaker 3>they all have like their own little</v>
<v Speaker 3>planets and it's inside like the album</v>

2255
01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:52.470
<v Speaker 3>jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he opened it up.</v>

2256
01:41:52.471 --> 01:41:54.940
<v Speaker 3>There's like planets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>

2257
01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:56.800
<v Speaker 3>It's really fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

2258
01:41:56.801 --> 01:41:58.780
<v Speaker 3>perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donny osmond and marie osmond,</v>

2259
01:41:58.781 --> 01:41:59.920
<v Speaker 3>very nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2260
01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:03.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to shop around for new</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion because They'll have different</v>

2261
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.050
<v Speaker 3>afterlives and I think you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>compare them to do because the planet</v>

2262
01:42:08.051 --> 01:42:10.000
<v Speaker 3>thing is due.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was pretty appealing.</v>

2263
01:42:10.270 --> 01:42:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Well a may imagine if we go back to your</v>
<v Speaker 3>original idea that this is some sort of</v>

2264
01:42:15.801 --> 01:42:19.270
<v Speaker 3>a software simulation and that's why</v>
<v Speaker 3>your memories are so wacky and nothing</v>

2265
01:42:19.271 --> 01:42:24.271
<v Speaker 3>sticks and imagine if you literally are</v>
<v Speaker 3>choosing by virtue of your decision to</v>

2266
01:42:25.931 --> 01:42:28.840
<v Speaker 3>join a certain religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what your afterlife will be like if</v>

2267
01:42:28.841 --> 01:42:31.420
<v Speaker 3>you're in a video game and there's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of different doors you have to</v>

2268
01:42:31.421 --> 01:42:34.210
<v Speaker 3>figure out which one's the right door to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go through and you go through that door.</v>

2269
01:42:34.210 --> 01:42:38.590
<v Speaker 3>It's a totally different adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if we really are a software</v>

2270
01:42:38.591 --> 01:42:42.610
<v Speaker 3>simulation and just like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the software allows you to pick an</v>

2271
01:42:42.611 --> 01:42:46.150
<v Speaker 3>afterlife and you do actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what you're actually</v>

2272
01:42:46.151 --> 01:42:49.810
<v Speaker 3>experiencing because for software that</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be totally practical if we're</v>

2273
01:42:49.811 --> 01:42:51.700
<v Speaker 3>software that would be totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>practical.</v>

2274
01:42:52.450 --> 01:42:57.220
<v Speaker 3>And that simulation theory thing is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>mindfuck because you don't know what</v>

2275
01:42:57.221 --> 01:42:58.900
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the rub.</v>

2276
01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:04.270
<v Speaker 3>The rub is one day without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we continue,</v>

2277
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:07.870
<v Speaker 3>if we don't get hit by an asteroid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we don't get swallowed up in a super</v>

2278
01:43:07.871 --> 01:43:10.480
<v Speaker 3>volcano or a tsunami or an earthquake or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something crazy,</v>

2279
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:15.670
<v Speaker 3>human beings will reach a point where if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at the exponential growth of</v>

2280
01:43:15.671 --> 01:43:18.490
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are going to be able to create an</v>

2281
01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:22.270
<v Speaker 3>artificial reality that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>indistinguishable from regular reality.</v>

2282
01:43:22.570 --> 01:43:25.420
<v Speaker 3>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how will we know if we're in it?</v>

2283
01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:28.780
<v Speaker 3>We won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how do we know if we're not in it</v>

2284
01:43:28.781 --> 01:43:30.870
<v Speaker 3>right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take the math one.</v>

2285
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.870
<v Speaker 3>One step further is that by the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one of those,</v>

2286
01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:38.740
<v Speaker 3>if it's a perfect simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the simulation will create another</v>

2287
01:43:38.770 --> 01:43:41.770
<v Speaker 3>simulation and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's turtles all the way down.</v>

2288
01:43:42.190 --> 01:43:44.200
<v Speaker 3>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is actually what the scientists,</v>

2289
01:43:44.290 --> 01:43:49.290
<v Speaker 3>they say that the number of original</v>
<v Speaker 3>species will be one and the number of</v>

2290
01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:53.210
<v Speaker 3>copies will eventually be gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2291
01:43:53.211 --> 01:43:54.380
<v Speaker 3>it could be thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions,</v>

2292
01:43:54.381 --> 01:43:56.810
<v Speaker 3>trillions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the odds that you're the original</v>

2293
01:43:56.811 --> 01:43:57.770
<v Speaker 3>copy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2294
01:43:57.771 --> 01:44:02.771
<v Speaker 3>the original might be one in a trillion</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's a real,</v>

2295
01:44:03.890 --> 01:44:07.790
<v Speaker 3>that's the big f,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's an f tHat if not possible now</v>

2296
01:44:07.791 --> 01:44:11.600
<v Speaker 3>or if not reality will one day be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2297
01:44:11.601 --> 01:44:14.600
<v Speaker 3>we can't tell where we are in the cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we're,</v>

2298
01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:18.440
<v Speaker 3>if we're a simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know if there were hundreds of</v>

2299
01:44:18.441 --> 01:44:19.640
<v Speaker 3>simulations before us.</v>

2300
01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:20.850
<v Speaker 3>There's no way to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2301
01:44:20.851 --> 01:44:24.830
<v Speaker 3>there's also the very slippery aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness where we shut it off every</v>

2302
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:28.400
<v Speaker 3>night and then turn it back on in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>morning and we assume that our memories</v>

2303
01:44:28.401 --> 01:44:30.680
<v Speaker 3>when we wake up in the morning are all</v>
<v Speaker 3>accurate.</v>

2304
01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:33.990
<v Speaker 3>We assume that we really did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2305
01:44:34.150 --> 01:44:38.780
<v Speaker 3>wake up November 17th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2016 in our bed,</v>

2306
01:44:38.781 --> 01:44:42.560
<v Speaker 3>put our clothes on with his database of</v>
<v Speaker 3>life experiences leading up to that</v>

2307
01:44:42.561 --> 01:44:43.880
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how the fuck do you know?</v>

2308
01:44:43.881 --> 01:44:47.090
<v Speaker 3>It didn't just start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just woke up and they might have been</v>

2309
01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:51.200
<v Speaker 3>installed with this goofy life memory</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you might have started this life</v>

2310
01:44:51.201 --> 01:44:52.280
<v Speaker 3>this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2311
01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:57.300
<v Speaker 3>If you look into physics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know when I say we,</v>

2312
01:44:57.501 --> 01:45:00.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean people much smarter who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>physicists,</v>

2313
01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.350
<v Speaker 3>know that things don't really exist</v>
<v Speaker 3>until you observe them.</v>

2314
01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:05.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell does that mean?</v>

2315
01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:08.630
<v Speaker 3>That's a tricky thing that people say.</v>

2316
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:12.470
<v Speaker 3>That's not necessarily true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what they mean by that?</v>

2317
01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:16.550
<v Speaker 3>That when you observe something in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>act of observing it,</v>

2318
01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:17.990
<v Speaker 3>you change it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's,</v>

2319
01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:19.870
<v Speaker 3>that's a different concept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

2320
01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:22.460
<v Speaker 3>But knowing that something's true like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

2321
01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:24.440
<v Speaker 3>There's the tree falls in the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2322
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:25.430
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2323
01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:28.730
<v Speaker 3>the observation changes that so that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>change thing.</v>

2324
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:30.480
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we are talking about the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2325
01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:33.230
<v Speaker 3>but the observation really only changes</v>
<v Speaker 3>it when you measure it.</v>

2326
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:37.070
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's the measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you know they do those particle</v>

2327
01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:38.600
<v Speaker 3>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are off.</v>

2328
01:45:38.630 --> 01:45:40.340
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever talked to a physicist</v>
<v Speaker 3>about that?</v>

2329
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:42.200
<v Speaker 3>Observing is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to.</v>

2330
01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:44.750
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to technically be made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to observe it.</v>

2331
01:45:44.751 --> 01:45:47.960
<v Speaker 3>If you're not measuring well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just looking at it like looking at what?</v>

2332
01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:50.430
<v Speaker 3>Seeing it or seeing any sign of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2333
01:45:50.450 --> 01:45:54.140
<v Speaker 3>but not anything that's an indication</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it must have been enough to</v>

2334
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:55.790
<v Speaker 3>solidify the past.</v>

2335
01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:58.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you never observed it before and then</v>

2336
01:45:58.281 --> 01:46:00.650
<v Speaker 3>you are observing and how do you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a difference between the</v>

2337
01:46:00.651 --> 01:46:03.800
<v Speaker 3>two results?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know even know what I'm talking</v>

2338
01:46:03.801 --> 01:46:07.070
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea the way it's been</v>

2339
01:46:07.071 --> 01:46:10.700
<v Speaker 3>explained to me by a friend of mine</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's actually a physicist,</v>

2340
01:46:10.730 --> 01:46:13.910
<v Speaker 3>he said it's often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of woo woo that's tacked</v>

2341
01:46:13.911 --> 01:46:16.460
<v Speaker 3>onto this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you're talking about these</v>

2342
01:46:16.461 --> 01:46:20.150
<v Speaker 3>measurements that people say like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the act of measuring something and</v>

2343
01:46:20.151 --> 01:46:21.800
<v Speaker 3>looking at something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you change the result.</v>

2344
01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:25.040
<v Speaker 3>He's lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is much better interpreted by the</v>

2345
01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:29.150
<v Speaker 3>measurement itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual act of seeing something or</v>

2346
01:46:29.151 --> 01:46:33.440
<v Speaker 3>recording something or interfacing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in some way to get them a reading.</v>

2347
01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:35.000
<v Speaker 3>As a result.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2348
01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:38.540
<v Speaker 3>that's much more likely what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no real evidence that looking at</v>

2349
01:46:38.541 --> 01:46:41.360
<v Speaker 3>something changes it because if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't looking at it before,</v>

2350
01:46:41.361 --> 01:46:43.760
<v Speaker 3>how do you know if it was different?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2351
01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:46.250
<v Speaker 3>well that was good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy,</v>

2352
01:46:46.251 --> 01:46:49.260
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's not the way I understood it,</v>

2353
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 3>but I'm</v>

2354
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.100
<v Speaker 1>also not a physicist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor do I have a friend who's a physicist</v>

2355
01:46:53.101 --> 01:46:53.940
<v Speaker 1>who can explain it to.</v>

2356
01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:58.070
<v Speaker 3>I get confused at these things because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're often repeated and the repeated</v>

2357
01:46:58.071 --> 01:47:00.530
<v Speaker 3>by people who haven't looked into it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets me worried.</v>

2358
01:47:00.770 --> 01:47:03.650
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things like the wage</v>
<v Speaker 3>gap thing.</v>

2359
01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:06.110
<v Speaker 3>Do you know The wage gap argument versus</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality?</v>

2360
01:47:06.111 --> 01:47:07.550
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've looked into it deeply,</v>

2361
01:47:07.670 --> 01:47:10.760
<v Speaker 3>so crazy one because people really smart</v>
<v Speaker 3>people will tell you,</v>

2362
01:47:10.761 --> 01:47:14.000
<v Speaker 3>women make seventy nine cents for every</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollar a man makes,</v>

2363
01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:16.970
<v Speaker 3>and that gives you the impression that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're working side by side in the same</v>

2364
01:47:16.971 --> 01:47:19.550
<v Speaker 3>factory and the woman's make it seventy</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine cents and the man's making a</v>

2365
01:47:19.551 --> 01:47:21.200
<v Speaker 3>dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what it means.</v>

2366
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:26.330
<v Speaker 3>What it means is overall men make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollar to seventy nine cents that women</v>

2367
01:47:26.331 --> 01:47:29.180
<v Speaker 3>make because of career choices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of jobs,</v>

2368
01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:32.180
<v Speaker 3>the different jobs that they choose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to make the argument</v>

2369
01:47:32.181 --> 01:47:34.400
<v Speaker 3>that it's more difficult for women to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get those jobs,</v>

2370
01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:36.440
<v Speaker 3>that's a different argument and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be right,</v>

2371
01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:40.910
<v Speaker 3>but that's not when you're saying that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wage discrimination gap.</v>

2372
01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:44.060
<v Speaker 3>Like when obama says we have to change</v>
<v Speaker 3>with wage discrimination,</v>

2373
01:47:44.061 --> 01:47:44.441
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

2374
01:47:44.441 --> 01:47:47.000
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do you think that an engineer</v>

2375
01:47:47.001 --> 01:47:50.270
<v Speaker 3>should get the same as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person who works,</v>

2376
01:47:50.271 --> 01:47:50.691
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2377
01:47:50.691 --> 01:47:51.970
<v Speaker 3>fill in the blank some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2378
01:47:52.010 --> 01:47:54.770
<v Speaker 3>typical female job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like when it comes to science and</v>

2379
01:47:54.771 --> 01:47:58.040
<v Speaker 3>engineering and a lot of those stem sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of subjects,</v>

2380
01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:01.880
<v Speaker 3>men sort of gravitate towards them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men gravitate towards riskier jobs.</v>

2381
01:48:01.881 --> 01:48:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Men are more likely to die on the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men choose different paths because of</v>

2382
01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:09.080
<v Speaker 3>testosterone and their gender and to</v>
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>

2383
01:48:09.081 --> 01:48:12.080
<v Speaker 3>That seems kind of silly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so when they start talking about</v>

2384
01:48:12.081 --> 01:48:15.170
<v Speaker 3>this gender gap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which everybody throws around all willy</v>

2385
01:48:15.171 --> 01:48:18.620
<v Speaker 3>nilly with no research whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they really believe that.</v>

2386
01:48:18.621 --> 01:48:21.850
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about two lawyers working</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the same firm side by side.</v>

2387
01:48:22.010 --> 01:48:24.050
<v Speaker 3>The man makes a dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one who makes seventy nine cents.</v>

2388
01:48:24.051 --> 01:48:24.820
<v Speaker 3>So it's not</v>

2389
01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:27.490
<v Speaker 1>how many statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many times have you been in a</v>

2390
01:48:27.491 --> 01:48:30.510
<v Speaker 1>conversation with somebody who believed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in in the 79,</v>

2391
01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:34.030
<v Speaker 1>seven figure and then you explained it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them and they said,</v>

2392
01:48:34.031 --> 01:48:35.710
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the case.</v>

2393
01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Then you showed them a link,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you proved it beyond any doubt and it</v>

2394
01:48:40.301 --> 01:48:41.320
<v Speaker 1>still didn't change their mind.</v>

2395
01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:44.290
<v Speaker 3>I won't accept the fact that could have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been wrong about something because</v>

2396
01:48:44.291 --> 01:48:46.260
<v Speaker 3>they've attached their identity to being</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

2397
01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:48.610
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge problem with anything gender</v>

2398
01:48:48.611 --> 01:48:51.250
<v Speaker 3>related.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gender thing is that the idea is</v>

2399
01:48:51.251 --> 01:48:53.410
<v Speaker 3>that women have been suppressed and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have for sure.</v>

2400
01:48:53.411 --> 01:48:55.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean women didn't get the right to</v>
<v Speaker 3>vote until the 20th century.</v>

2401
01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kinda crazy.</v>

2402
01:48:57.550 --> 01:48:58.340
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>

2403
01:48:58.340 --> 01:49:01.780
<v Speaker 3>we went through a Long time in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>country where women couldn't even vote,</v>

2404
01:49:02.110 --> 01:49:04.810
<v Speaker 3>so absolutely they been suppressed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely,</v>

2405
01:49:04.930 --> 01:49:06.340
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of things that brought</v>
<v Speaker 3>them out of that.</v>

2406
01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:07.690
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>birth control,</v>

2407
01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:10.150
<v Speaker 3>like the ability to choose whether or</v>
<v Speaker 3>not they're going to be pregnant.</v>

2408
01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.033
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2409
01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:12.520
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the laws,</v>

2410
01:49:12.521 --> 01:49:15.640
<v Speaker 3>changing discrimination laws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>changing people's perceptions of what</v>

2411
01:49:15.641 --> 01:49:18.760
<v Speaker 3>women are changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those things are absolutely real,</v>

2412
01:49:19.060 --> 01:49:23.110
<v Speaker 3>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't lie about numbers.</v>

2413
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:26.800
<v Speaker 3>Like as soon as you bullshit people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they have reason to disbelieve you,</v>

2414
01:49:26.801 --> 01:49:27.370
<v Speaker 3>but everything.</v>

2415
01:49:27.370 --> 01:49:29.320
<v Speaker 3>So if you start bullshitting about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wage gap,</v>

2416
01:49:29.590 --> 01:49:31.990
<v Speaker 3>and this is not saying that it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>More difficult to be a woman.</v>

2417
01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:34.000
<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's moRe difficult because I</v>

2418
01:49:34.001 --> 01:49:36.520
<v Speaker 3>think men are pieces of shit and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of violent,</v>

2419
01:49:36.521 --> 01:49:38.500
<v Speaker 3>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>creepy men that probably want to rape</v>

2420
01:49:38.501 --> 01:49:41.980
<v Speaker 3>you and I would hate to be a woman in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of a scenario.</v>

2421
01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:45.070
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not denying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably more difficult in our</v>

2422
01:49:45.071 --> 01:49:48.700
<v Speaker 3>society because of a lot of shitty men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more difficult to be a woman,</v>

2423
01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:52.740
<v Speaker 3>but you can't lie about numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you start lose students,</v>

2424
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:57.160
<v Speaker 3>you start pretending that women get paid</v>
<v Speaker 3>less for the same job across the board.</v>

2425
01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:01.030
<v Speaker 3>You ruin the whole argument because now</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not dealing in reality.</v>

2426
01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Now we're doing the same thing where</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not looking at caitlin jenner is a</v>

2427
01:50:04.811 --> 01:50:05.290
<v Speaker 3>human.</v>

2428
01:50:05.290 --> 01:50:08.230
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at as a gender identity</v>
<v Speaker 3>hero.</v>

2429
01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:08.921
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2430
01:50:08.921 --> 01:50:10.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about as a human?</v>

2431
01:50:10.330 --> 01:50:15.130
<v Speaker 3>Like we were supposed to celebrate</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone or or not as a human being as a</v>

2432
01:50:15.131 --> 01:50:18.170
<v Speaker 3>total package.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not doing that and this is where</v>

2433
01:50:18.171 --> 01:50:23.171
<v Speaker 3>we're treating the whole subject with</v>
<v Speaker 3>blinders because it pertains to gender.</v>

2434
01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:26.950
<v Speaker 3>We can't look at the reality of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would generalize that to say that</v>

2435
01:50:26.951 --> 01:50:31.951
<v Speaker 3>nobody's ever won an argument with data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It almost never happens because the</v>

2436
01:50:32.231 --> 01:50:33.850
<v Speaker 3>problem is that people just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2437
01:50:33.851 --> 01:50:36.310
<v Speaker 3>your data's role,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so and that's the end of the</v>

2438
01:50:36.311 --> 01:50:37.480
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but does that.</v>

2439
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:42.440
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that less and less the case now</v>
<v Speaker 3>that ever before issue would be shed,</v>

2440
01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:45.160
<v Speaker 3>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actively in conversations with</v>

2441
01:50:45.161 --> 01:50:48.010
<v Speaker 3>people in which I can show them all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>data that I want.</v>

2442
01:50:48.290 --> 01:50:50.710
<v Speaker 3>It makes no difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humans are twitter people,</v>

2443
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:54.370
<v Speaker 3>even regular people in the world in real</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2444
01:50:54.370 --> 01:50:55.570
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2445
01:50:55.571 --> 01:50:57.370
<v Speaker 3>there's a broad spectrum of people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

2446
01:50:57.371 --> 01:50:58.300
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>

2447
01:50:58.510 --> 01:51:00.070
<v Speaker 3>When you're talking about people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you respect,</v>

2448
01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:01.840
<v Speaker 3>your peers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>colleagues,</v>

2449
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:03.400
<v Speaker 3>fellow cartoonIsts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2450
01:51:03.401 --> 01:51:08.230
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you talking about regular educated</v>

2451
01:51:08.231 --> 01:51:10.270
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anybody change their</v>

2452
01:51:10.271 --> 01:51:12.890
<v Speaker 3>mind on that topic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that specific topic.</v>

2453
01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:14.290
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2454
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:15.310
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2455
01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:18.340
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people have some pretty heated</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussions about it too and completely</v>

2456
01:51:18.341 --> 01:51:21.310
<v Speaker 3>uninformed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people don't have an emotional,</v>

2457
01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:25.050
<v Speaker 3>a lock on the topic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can move them with data just</v>

2458
01:51:25.210 --> 01:51:26.021
<v Speaker 3>because they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2459
01:51:26.021 --> 01:51:26.711
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's better data.</v>

2460
01:51:26.711 --> 01:51:29.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people are so dug in on that</v>

2461
01:51:29.861 --> 01:51:32.020
<v Speaker 3>particular topic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very insidious,</v>

2462
01:51:32.190 --> 01:51:36.010
<v Speaker 3>very insidious because I think it like</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about what the hillary</v>

2463
01:51:36.011 --> 01:51:39.070
<v Speaker 3>clinton thing about lying about Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you lie about that,</v>

2464
01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:40.930
<v Speaker 3>as soon as you lie about something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm going,</v>

2465
01:51:40.931 --> 01:51:41.770
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

2466
01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:44.080
<v Speaker 3>You know when when you see you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you've seen it,</v>

2467
01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:48.760
<v Speaker 3>that director comey video where compares</v>
<v Speaker 3>what cami said versus what hillary is</v>

2468
01:51:48.761 --> 01:51:49.594
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2469
01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:51.220
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit.</v>

2470
01:51:51.490 --> 01:51:54.190
<v Speaker 3>Like you're just lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you just keep lying.</v>

2471
01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:57.280
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a crazy moment where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing this because it didn't.</v>

2472
01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:01.480
<v Speaker 3>DIdn't exist until recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had This youtube phenomenon where you</v>

2473
01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:05.410
<v Speaker 3>can watch and get millions of hits on</v>
<v Speaker 3>these videos where it shows the reality</v>

2474
01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:10.560
<v Speaker 3>versus what you're saying and when you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you soon as you throw a non-reality</v>

2475
01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:13.420
<v Speaker 3>into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that you're dealing with it from</v>

2476
01:52:13.421 --> 01:52:16.330
<v Speaker 3>a team perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're just trying to manipulate</v>

2477
01:52:16.450 --> 01:52:20.260
<v Speaker 3>whatever the facts are or wherever the</v>
<v Speaker 3>argument is to get your team in.</v>

2478
01:52:20.290 --> 01:52:23.290
<v Speaker 3>You don't really care what's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You women get paid less period.</v>

2479
01:52:23.291 --> 01:52:26.260
<v Speaker 3>You fucking piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seventy nine cents to a dollar,</v>

2480
01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:29.320
<v Speaker 3>read the facts and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't even argue with it.</v>

2481
01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:32.590
<v Speaker 3>You can't even bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's everything all the time.</v>

2482
01:52:32.650 --> 01:52:35.290
<v Speaker 3>If there's any emotional connection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just think that,</v>

2483
01:52:35.650 --> 01:52:37.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>logic and data and you know,</v>

2484
01:52:37.810 --> 01:52:39.560
<v Speaker 3>arguments matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2485
01:52:39.590 --> 01:52:42.310
<v Speaker 3>they're just so rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you disagree also,</v>

2486
01:52:42.370 --> 01:52:43.960
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so happy to be a man.</v>

2487
01:52:43.961 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 3>You must be so happy to be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think</v>

2488
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:47.690
<v Speaker 2>men are the only ones who could run this</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2489
01:52:47.810 --> 01:52:51.050
<v Speaker 2>You think men don't discriminate against</v>
<v Speaker 2>women every step of the way.</v>

2490
01:52:51.051 --> 01:52:53.150
<v Speaker 2>It must be really nice to have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>white male privileged.</v>

2491
01:52:53.151 --> 01:52:58.151
<v Speaker 2>Scott adams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sarcasm as a replacement for reason</v>

2492
01:52:58.810 --> 01:53:01.490
<v Speaker 2>is probably the most annoying thing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

2493
01:53:01.491 --> 01:53:02.440
<v Speaker 2>And I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2494
01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:06.800
<v Speaker 2>the sarcasm has been raining on me for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year for writing about trump,</v>

2495
01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:09.260
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly what you said is like,</v>

2496
01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:13.670
<v Speaker 2>so then trump would get elected and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll just make everything good and then</v>

2497
01:53:13.671 --> 01:53:15.470
<v Speaker 2>there will be just unicorns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2498
01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird argument that people love</v>

2499
01:53:19.431 --> 01:53:22.070
<v Speaker 2>to put words in your mouth and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>force you to defend them.</v>

2500
01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:27.590
<v Speaker 2>I talk about the word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as a tell for that,</v>

2501
01:53:27.591 --> 01:53:29.840
<v Speaker 2>whatever's going to come next as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hallucination.</v>

2502
01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:32.430
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you say to say to me,</v>

2503
01:53:32.431 --> 01:53:33.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter who said,</v>

2504
01:53:33.331 --> 01:53:34.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2505
01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:36.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the store yesterday,</v>

2506
01:53:37.250 --> 01:53:38.083
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

2507
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:42.320
<v Speaker 2>So you abandoned your children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

2508
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:44.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever comes,</v>

2509
01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:46.880
<v Speaker 2>we'll just won't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>

2510
01:53:46.881 --> 01:53:48.950
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really funny.</v>

2511
01:53:49.730 --> 01:53:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can definitely do that.</v>

2512
01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:52.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the art of persuasion,</v>

2513
01:53:52.581 --> 01:53:53.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hypnosis.</v>

2514
01:53:53.541 --> 01:53:55.190
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a pocket watch?</v>

2515
01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:56.660
<v Speaker 2>You have one of those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2516
01:53:56.661 --> 01:53:58.490
<v Speaker 2>that's not part of the process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weirdly enough.</v>

2517
01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.430
<v Speaker 2>But it isn't cartoons and movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2518
01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:04.760
<v Speaker 2>I think there was it ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there was one movie,</v>

2519
01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:07.940
<v Speaker 2>so that's well known in the history that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one movie,</v>

2520
01:54:07.941 --> 01:54:12.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was a showed</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody doing using a watch to</v>

2521
01:54:12.171 --> 01:54:13.820
<v Speaker 2>hypnotize and then it just became a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

2522
01:54:13.821 --> 01:54:16.490
<v Speaker 2>but it was never a thing within the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypnotist world.</v>

2523
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Was theRe ever a moment during this</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole campaign where it was getting</v>

2524
01:54:21.501 --> 01:54:25.280
<v Speaker 2>really crazy and people were angry about</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many different things?</v>

2525
01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Like how about when all those women came</v>
<v Speaker 2>out in mass?</v>

2526
01:54:28.221 --> 01:54:30.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this and moss and moss.</v>

2527
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:34.040
<v Speaker 2>There was at one time were all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>women were coming out saYing Donald</v>

2528
01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Trump tried to grab my tits and Donald</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump and some of them were pretty</v>

2529
01:54:36.741 --> 01:54:39.860
<v Speaker 2>innocuous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was all together like a</v>

2530
01:54:39.861 --> 01:54:42.680
<v Speaker 2>coordinated effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there ever a moment wHere you're</v>

2531
01:54:42.681 --> 01:54:44.300
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck that I do?</v>

2532
01:54:44.630 --> 01:54:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Like why did I come out and supported</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy?</v>

2533
01:54:46.551 --> 01:54:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Like what Did I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hate that I'm getting right now that</v>

2534
01:54:49.601 --> 01:54:53.340
<v Speaker 2>that was the moment that I switched my</v>
<v Speaker 2>endorsement that Gary Johnson.</v>

2535
01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:57.260
<v Speaker 2>I remember that and my reasoning was</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Gary Johnson only touches</v>

2536
01:54:57.261 --> 01:55:00.560
<v Speaker 2>himself and that's something that I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect in a leader.</v>

2537
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:03.830
<v Speaker 2>No trouble there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was tongue in cheek.</v>

2538
01:55:04.190 --> 01:55:06.710
<v Speaker 2>It was tongue and cheek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was also getting out of the blast</v>

2539
01:55:06.711 --> 01:55:09.320
<v Speaker 2>zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was never as supporting him</v>

2540
01:55:09.321 --> 01:55:12.560
<v Speaker 2>based on policies or I was just talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about is persuasion,</v>

2541
01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:15.080
<v Speaker 2>but was there ever a time where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

2542
01:55:15.170 --> 01:55:18.110
<v Speaker 2>I should probably make a moral</v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction because I'm getting caught</v>

2543
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:23.830
<v Speaker 2>up in this wave of angry white people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their massage and racism and all the</v>

2544
01:55:26.001 --> 01:55:26.190
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>

2545
01:55:26.190 --> 01:55:27.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was the worst aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2546
01:55:27.501 --> 01:55:30.680
<v Speaker 2>That the two percent that we already</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed it and you get caught up in</v>

2547
01:55:30.681 --> 01:55:35.270
<v Speaker 2>this association game that people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing when they have this us versus them</v>

2548
01:55:35.310 --> 01:55:37.340
<v Speaker 2>little battle going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever think like,</v>

2549
01:55:37.341 --> 01:55:38.960
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did I do?</v>

2550
01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Not in those words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm.</v>

2551
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm fortunately</v>

2552
01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:46.590
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a situation where I have what I call</v>

2553
01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:50.340
<v Speaker 1>fuck you money and I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can kind of take some risks that you</v>

2554
01:55:50.341 --> 01:55:55.341
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't take earlier in your career and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them is the risk to say what ever</v>

2555
01:55:55.421 --> 01:55:58.800
<v Speaker 1>I think is useful and necessary and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to say,</v>

2556
01:55:58.950 --> 01:56:03.950
<v Speaker 1>and so that is a huge risk to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with anybody unpleasant.</v>

2557
01:56:04.590 --> 01:56:07.650
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time I self identify with</v>

2558
01:56:07.651 --> 01:56:10.920
<v Speaker 1>being ultra liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like liberal people seem a little too</v>

2559
01:56:10.921 --> 01:56:13.050
<v Speaker 1>conservative for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm left to them.</v>

2560
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:17.410
<v Speaker 3>That is interesting about you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely wanted to get to that</v>

2561
01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:20.800
<v Speaker 3>because you're not a right wing guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2562
01:56:20.801 --> 01:56:22.930
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're very reasonable.</v>

2563
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:25.450
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I thought was so fascinating about</v>

2564
01:56:25.451 --> 01:56:26.110
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2565
01:56:26.110 --> 01:56:27.670
<v Speaker 3>and it actually makes sense now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say it,</v>

2566
01:56:27.671 --> 01:56:30.100
<v Speaker 3>you have fuck you money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so why shouldn't you just speak about</v>

2567
01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:32.890
<v Speaker 3>whatever attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive or negative you might see and</v>

2568
01:56:32.891 --> 01:56:35.470
<v Speaker 3>when look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like you're looking at a puzzle,</v>

2569
01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:36.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all low.</v>

2570
01:56:36.261 --> 01:56:38.560
<v Speaker 3>We'll look at this piece here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This piece is going to go right there</v>

2571
01:56:38.561 --> 01:56:39.790
<v Speaker 3>and see there's an opening here.</v>

2572
01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:44.730
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a space for this of somebody</v>

2573
01:56:44.731 --> 01:56:46.650
<v Speaker 1>who didn't have a team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2574
01:56:46.850 --> 01:56:49.500
<v Speaker 1>As part of the reason I don't vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't join a party.</v>

2575
01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:51.030
<v Speaker 1>You didn't vote at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2576
01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:54.180
<v Speaker 1>it</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that ironic.</v>

2577
01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:56.460
<v Speaker 1>It would bias me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2578
01:56:56.461 --> 01:56:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you vote,</v>

2579
01:56:58.561 --> 01:57:02.500
<v Speaker 1>you joined the team but you like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>klingon in this world.</v>

2580
01:57:02.501 --> 01:57:06.870
<v Speaker 1>He just wrote roman through the streets</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then people make those rules and use</v>

2581
01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:08.520
<v Speaker 1>to bide by them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that work?</v>

2582
01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non participant in our democracy.</v>

2583
01:57:11.341 --> 01:57:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Scott adams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2584
01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:16.650
<v Speaker 1>secretly canadian by California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I didn't think it mattered that</v>

2585
01:57:16.651 --> 01:57:18.830
<v Speaker 1>much who I voted for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2586
01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:21.780
<v Speaker 1>but I also think that staying unbiased</v>
<v Speaker 1>is important.</v>

2587
01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:24.090
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just not a joiner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But wHat about others?</v>

2588
01:57:24.110 --> 01:57:26.870
<v Speaker 3>Things like you could always write in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>presidential candidate if you want to do</v>

2589
01:57:26.871 --> 01:57:28.340
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like voting on things like</v>

2590
01:57:28.341 --> 01:57:30.770
<v Speaker 3>legalizing marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are really important.</v>

2591
01:57:30.890 --> 01:57:31.723
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's.</v>

2592
01:57:32.050 --> 01:57:34.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't notice I go right to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget fuck the death penalty.</v>

2593
01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:38.080
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of important issues you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could vote on,</v>

2594
01:57:38.081 --> 01:57:38.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2595
01:57:38.890 --> 01:57:42.730
<v Speaker 1>But my take on that is that the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who think they understand those issues</v>

2596
01:57:42.731 --> 01:57:46.480
<v Speaker 1>almost never do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the few that I could understand well</v>

2597
01:57:46.481 --> 01:57:48.100
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like legalizing weed,</v>

2598
01:57:48.610 --> 01:57:51.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was going the way I wanted it anyway.</v>

2599
01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:55.570
<v Speaker 1>so according to the polls that thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hillary clinton was gonna win,</v>

2600
01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:57.460
<v Speaker 1>see all these polls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem,</v>

2601
01:57:57.610 --> 01:58:01.250
<v Speaker 1>the weed pulls where we're much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate and it</v>

2602
01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:06.120
<v Speaker 3>or a gap there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the weed pulls are more accurate.</v>

2603
01:58:06.210 --> 01:58:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are for sure it won.</v>

2604
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:10.410
<v Speaker 3>It won by a landslide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I thought it was important.</v>

2605
01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:14.010
<v Speaker 3>I felt like if I was going to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the voting for freedom,</v>

2606
01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:15.630
<v Speaker 3>wherever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever it's possible,</v>

2607
01:58:15.631 --> 01:58:18.780
<v Speaker 3>especially freedom is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not hurting anybody and you're</v>

2608
01:58:18.781 --> 01:58:21.660
<v Speaker 3>removing the possibility of being locked</v>
<v Speaker 3>up for something.</v>

2609
01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:25.080
<v Speaker 3>IT's not hurting anybody across the</v>
<v Speaker 3>board whether it's pot or whether it's</v>

2610
01:58:25.081 --> 01:58:26.330
<v Speaker 3>wearing dresses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2611
01:58:26.370 --> 01:58:30.360
<v Speaker 3>for that I would be just as enthusiastic</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a transgender law if someone made</v>

2612
01:58:30.361 --> 01:58:33.030
<v Speaker 3>it a law where a man couldn't become a</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>

2613
01:58:33.090 --> 01:58:34.770
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we were fighting against that.</v>

2614
01:58:34.771 --> 01:58:39.771
<v Speaker 3>I would be as enthusiastic as I am about</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost almost enthusiasts to pot thing</v>

2615
01:58:40.801 --> 01:58:43.600
<v Speaker 3>to is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>represents a freedom issue as much as it</v>

2616
01:58:43.601 --> 01:58:44.434
<v Speaker 3>is anything else.</v>

2617
01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I put those in a different frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2618
01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:48.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2619
01:58:48.810 --> 01:58:51.570
<v Speaker 1>the birth of the nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this debate about states'</v>

2620
01:58:51.571 --> 01:58:53.850
<v Speaker 1>rights and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the federal government do and the</v>

2621
01:58:53.851 --> 01:58:56.310
<v Speaker 1>idea was that the more local the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

2622
01:58:56.311 --> 01:58:58.860
<v Speaker 1>the better they understood the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>

2623
01:58:59.310 --> 01:59:01.830
<v Speaker 1>But fast forward today with the internet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2624
01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:06.480
<v Speaker 1>and more and the states are like little</v>
<v Speaker 1>laboratories so we can watch,</v>

2625
01:59:06.481 --> 01:59:07.830
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how'd it go in Colorado?</v>

2626
01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:11.370
<v Speaker 1>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't Have to argue on principle or</v>

2627
01:59:11.371 --> 01:59:14.640
<v Speaker 1>morality anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're actually beyond that because we</v>

2628
01:59:14.641 --> 01:59:16.920
<v Speaker 1>can measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can ab test with the,</v>

2629
01:59:16.921 --> 01:59:18.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the states.</v>

2630
01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:22.740
<v Speaker 1>So with everything from abortion law to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a weed,</v>

2631
01:59:23.250 --> 01:59:24.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

2632
01:59:24.091 --> 01:59:26.010
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let the states Do it and let's just make</v>

2633
01:59:26.011 --> 01:59:29.550
<v Speaker 1>sure we measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure we have a real,</v>

2634
01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:31.090
<v Speaker 1>a thing that matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2635
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:33.340
<v Speaker 1>that we can say if it reaches this</v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

2636
01:59:33.341 --> 01:59:35.220
<v Speaker 1>they work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's crime it didn't.</v>

2637
01:59:36.030 --> 01:59:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's the direction we're</v>

2638
01:59:38.221 --> 01:59:42.480
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is insanely useful because it</v>

2639
01:59:42.481 --> 01:59:45.900
<v Speaker 1>takes all the emotion out of it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we don't have to wonder if it's our</v>

2640
01:59:45.901 --> 01:59:48.690
<v Speaker 1>right to smoke weed or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just see how it worked out.</v>

2641
01:59:49.050 --> 01:59:49.750
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2642
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:51.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't disagree With what you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

2643
01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:55.600
<v Speaker 3>but I also think that it's that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the morality and ethics play a</v>

2644
01:59:55.601 --> 01:59:58.990
<v Speaker 3>part of it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think reading for the first state.</v>

2645
01:59:59.470 --> 02:00:01.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But after that you can just see what</v>

2646
02:00:01.571 --> 02:00:03.280
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2647
02:00:03.281 --> 02:00:06.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't know because that means in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>49 other states you leave open the</v>

2648
02:00:06.671 --> 02:00:10.930
<v Speaker 3>possibility that people are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>locked up in jail for nonviolent crimes</v>

2649
02:00:10.931 --> 02:00:13.870
<v Speaker 3>that don't hurt anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that seems to be a giant ethic</v>

2650
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:16.640
<v Speaker 3>temporarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's temporarily,</v>

2651
02:00:16.641 --> 02:00:19.900
<v Speaker 3>it could ruin their life knowing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the law,</v>

2652
02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:21.310
<v Speaker 3>the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this temporary,</v>

2653
02:00:21.390 --> 02:00:24.260
<v Speaker 3>it was temporarily still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're still there.</v>

2654
02:00:24.261 --> 02:00:27.610
<v Speaker 3>That's not optimal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not optimal and the consequences</v>

2655
02:00:27.611 --> 02:00:29.770
<v Speaker 3>are too grave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're taking away people's freedom.</v>

2656
02:00:29.771 --> 02:00:32.800
<v Speaker 3>So to me it becomes primarily a freedom</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

2657
02:00:32.801 --> 02:00:36.160
<v Speaker 3>The same way it'd be if men wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>wear dresses or if women wanted to wear</v>

2658
02:00:36.161 --> 02:00:38.230
<v Speaker 3>combat boots and all of sudden we said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't have that anymore.</v>

2659
02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:39.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're giving two examples that I</v>

2660
02:00:39.881 --> 02:00:41.360
<v Speaker 3>consider easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2661
02:00:41.361 --> 02:00:42.960
<v Speaker 3>the weed and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2662
02:00:42.970 --> 02:00:44.080
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gender thing.</v>

2663
02:00:44.110 --> 02:00:46.300
<v Speaker 3>Those are easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those should be available to everybody.</v>

2664
02:00:46.301 --> 02:00:46.780
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2665
02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:50.950
<v Speaker 3>so let's go with one that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which would be automated cars.</v>

2666
02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

2667
02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:53.200
<v Speaker 3>I love that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2668
02:00:53.410 --> 02:00:54.640
<v Speaker 3>How about this one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good example,</v>

2669
02:00:54.641 --> 02:00:56.230
<v Speaker 3>like when we get to a certain point in</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

2670
02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:59.020
<v Speaker 3>will we lose our freedom to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomous?</v>

2671
02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:02.770
<v Speaker 3>Will we lose our freedom to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive a car and be able to steer and</v>

2672
02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:04.600
<v Speaker 3>trust you to hit the brakes when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to?</v>

2673
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of your autonomy is going away.</v>

2674
02:01:06.741 --> 02:01:07.960
<v Speaker 1>It's going aWay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2675
02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:09.860
<v Speaker 1>So think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I blogged about this today.</v>

2676
02:01:09.950 --> 02:01:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Suppose you had a fitness band and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like the future.</v>

2677
02:01:13.031 --> 02:01:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not long time of five or 10 years and</v>

2678
02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>they can do everything from tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you should take a sip of water</v>

2679
02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:20.960
<v Speaker 1>because you're dehydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It knows what kind of food you should</v>

2680
02:01:20.961 --> 02:01:23.780
<v Speaker 1>eat and when it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you should sleep and it tells you</v>

2681
02:01:23.781 --> 02:01:27.170
<v Speaker 1>how the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning you're going to say,</v>

2682
02:01:27.230 --> 02:01:28.400
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good suggestion.</v>

2683
02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll either do that or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually you're going to see that</v>

2684
02:01:31.521 --> 02:01:34.850
<v Speaker 1>their suggestion is better than whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell you would have done on your own</v>

2685
02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:38.710
<v Speaker 1>and you're just going to start following</v>
<v Speaker 1>the app and eventually that app is going</v>

2686
02:01:38.711 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>to be controlling your</v>

2687
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:43.070
<v Speaker 2>life while you have the sensation that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're deciding.</v>

2688
02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:48.200
<v Speaker 2>maybe you dude nomy rebel out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I to make my own choices.</v>

2689
02:01:48.201 --> 02:01:50.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to rip off that fitbit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man.</v>

2690
02:01:50.211 --> 02:01:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fitbit were free.</v>

2691
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:56.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to run and when I feel tired</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll stop or keep pushing because that's</v>

2692
02:01:56.571 --> 02:01:58.340
<v Speaker 2>what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Push harder.</v>

2693
02:01:58.341 --> 02:02:00.440
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag push harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2694
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:02.300
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2695
02:02:03.230 --> 02:02:07.580
<v Speaker 2>I think also people like when things</v>
<v Speaker 2>become,</v>

2696
02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:10.280
<v Speaker 2>when you have less stuff to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>or think about,</v>

2697
02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:11.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as you get in your car and</v>

2698
02:02:11.751 --> 02:02:13.670
<v Speaker 2>the car drives itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well now I don't have to think about</v>

2699
02:02:13.671 --> 02:02:15.020
<v Speaker 2>that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2700
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:19.040
<v Speaker 2>I was going to invest in alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>

2701
02:02:19.041 --> 02:02:21.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies that produced and manufactured</v>

2702
02:02:21.171 --> 02:02:24.620
<v Speaker 2>alcohol because it could be drunk in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your car now because self driving cars</v>

2703
02:02:24.621 --> 02:02:25.550
<v Speaker 2>are coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2704
02:02:25.590 --> 02:02:27.380
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the day they do,</v>

2705
02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:31.670
<v Speaker 2>80 percent of the reasons not to drink</v>
<v Speaker 2>just goes away,</v>

2706
02:02:32.090 --> 02:02:33.320
<v Speaker 2>which is how do you get home?</v>

2707
02:02:34.090 --> 02:02:35.990
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2708
02:02:37.130 --> 02:02:38.810
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they'll have no steering</v>
<v Speaker 2>wheel at all?</v>

2709
02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If everything goes wrong?</v>

2710
02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:43.460
<v Speaker 2>I think it will have his steering wheel</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

2711
02:02:43.490 --> 02:02:45.530
<v Speaker 2>you have to get off the road and</v>
<v Speaker 2>present.</v>

2712
02:02:45.531 --> 02:02:47.360
<v Speaker 2>If you get drunk you're like fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could drive.</v>

2713
02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:49.640
<v Speaker 2>You want to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though it's autonomous,</v>

2714
02:02:49.670 --> 02:02:52.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be too drunk to program the</v>

2715
02:02:52.521 --> 02:02:55.070
<v Speaker 2>address and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of drive?</v>

2716
02:02:55.370 --> 02:02:57.890
<v Speaker 2>And it started driving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>

2717
02:02:58.610 --> 02:03:01.400
<v Speaker 2>We don't have that problem with uber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2718
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:04.010
<v Speaker 2>no matter how drunk I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never tried to come out from the back</v>

2719
02:03:04.011 --> 02:03:06.200
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not right in front of you.</v>

2720
02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:09.620
<v Speaker 2>And also with uber you're too busy</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out whether the guy</v>

2721
02:03:09.621 --> 02:03:13.730
<v Speaker 2>driving needs a serial killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need a breathalyzer on there to get</v>

2722
02:03:13.731 --> 02:03:17.540
<v Speaker 2>control of the steering wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to be able to take a swab and</v>

2723
02:03:17.541 --> 02:03:18.950
<v Speaker 2>run it through machines from them.</v>

2724
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:23.300
<v Speaker 2>What kind of dna that's fucking creep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has you ever gone through security</v>

2725
02:03:23.301 --> 02:03:27.800
<v Speaker 2>lately and they do the little swab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put it in the machine and I'm</v>

2726
02:03:27.801 --> 02:03:30.170
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it know about me?</v>

2727
02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:35.380
<v Speaker 2>How much can it figure it out for me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because from your odor and your dna or</v>

2728
02:03:36.291 --> 02:03:39.500
<v Speaker 2>whatever the hell they're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could probably know a lot about me.</v>

2729
02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:42.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they definitely could if they.</v>

2730
02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:46.020
<v Speaker 2>Well tHat's the big argument about those</v>
<v Speaker 2>fingerprint scanners on cell phones that</v>

2731
02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:49.970
<v Speaker 2>they're slowly but surely accumulating a</v>
<v Speaker 2>database of fingerprints of all the</v>

2732
02:03:49.971 --> 02:03:52.250
<v Speaker 2>people in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2733
02:03:52.730 --> 02:03:57.730
<v Speaker 2>That's scary to</v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly but surely the boundaries between</v>

2734
02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:02.240
<v Speaker 2>people and data are eroding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me ask you this.</v>

2735
02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:04.060
<v Speaker 2>So in the news today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2736
02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:06.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't trump himself.</v>

2737
02:04:06.501 --> 02:04:10.250
<v Speaker 2>I think that the discussion of a muslim</v>
<v Speaker 2>database,</v>

2738
02:04:10.970 --> 02:04:13.850
<v Speaker 2>did you hear them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of collecting names.</v>

2739
02:04:13.851 --> 02:04:17.870
<v Speaker 2>I think only the people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>noncitizens coming into the country</v>

2740
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:19.340
<v Speaker 2>which raises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2741
02:04:19.341 --> 02:04:24.070
<v Speaker 2>every kind of nazi concentration camp</v>
<v Speaker 2>alarm and should um,</v>

2742
02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:27.440
<v Speaker 2>but do you think we don't already have</v>
<v Speaker 2>that list?</v>

2743
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Don't question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think that somewhere in our</v>

2744
02:04:30.681 --> 02:04:34.190
<v Speaker 2>big data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they can't tell the citizens and</v>

2745
02:04:34.191 --> 02:04:36.740
<v Speaker 2>in fact they can even tell the</v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians because they're probably</v>

2746
02:04:36.741 --> 02:04:38.100
<v Speaker 2>only a few people who</v>

2747
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:40.260
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a few people in the government</v>

2748
02:04:40.261 --> 02:04:44.700
<v Speaker 1>who know what we know about citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that there's anybody coming</v>

2749
02:04:44.701 --> 02:04:48.240
<v Speaker 1>into the country and we don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good idea of where they are at</v>

2750
02:04:48.241 --> 02:04:50.370
<v Speaker 1>any time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if they have back doors into</v>

2751
02:04:50.371 --> 02:04:53.340
<v Speaker 1>everything from the credit card</v>
<v Speaker 1>processing companies to,</v>

2752
02:04:53.610 --> 02:04:56.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other big cell phone companies,</v>

2753
02:04:56.850 --> 02:04:59.910
<v Speaker 1>they have a working profile on</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

2754
02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:02.540
<v Speaker 1>If they want it done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

2755
02:05:02.541 --> 02:05:04.290
<v Speaker 1>I have to push the button to run the</v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

2756
02:05:04.620 --> 02:05:07.560
<v Speaker 1>But if they wanted to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they wanted to know your religion,</v>

2757
02:05:07.950 --> 02:05:11.550
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't need to have you fill it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in a form becauSe they could check</v>

2758
02:05:11.551 --> 02:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>your credIt card and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2759
02:05:12.641 --> 02:05:14.670
<v Speaker 1>you buys gas next to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2760
02:05:14.671 --> 02:05:17.400
<v Speaker 1>the synagogue or the mosque or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his friends are.</v>

2761
02:05:17.401 --> 02:05:19.650
<v Speaker 1>They use because they do the same things</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>

2762
02:05:20.250 --> 02:05:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Big data already knows your religion.</v>

2763
02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:25.290
<v Speaker 3>If someone wants to track down all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

2764
02:05:25.291 --> 02:05:27.690
<v Speaker 3>it's the thing is who is the someone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many?</v>

2765
02:05:27.691 --> 02:05:29.640
<v Speaker 3>Like I have a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always worried.</v>

2766
02:05:29.641 --> 02:05:32.790
<v Speaker 3>The government's like looking into his</v>
<v Speaker 3>email and following them.</v>

2767
02:05:33.210 --> 02:05:34.620
<v Speaker 3>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I always say,</v>

2768
02:05:34.621 --> 02:05:37.710
<v Speaker 3>like who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people are they doing this to?</v>

2769
02:05:37.790 --> 02:05:40.500
<v Speaker 3>There's hundreds of millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people work in the government?</v>

2770
02:05:40.650 --> 02:05:41.880
<v Speaker 3>How are they doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2771
02:05:41.881 --> 02:05:43.020
<v Speaker 3>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a good story.</v>

2772
02:05:43.350 --> 02:05:45.050
<v Speaker 3>This is how people will think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2773
02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:45.990
<v Speaker 3>the following me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2774
02:05:46.170 --> 02:05:48.780
<v Speaker 3>listen to this story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy who broke into the white house,</v>

2775
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:51.780
<v Speaker 3>do you know about that story?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy who ran through the white.</v>

2776
02:05:51.781 --> 02:05:55.620
<v Speaker 3>I add a bit about it in my last netflix</v>
<v Speaker 3>special because this is where</v>

2777
02:05:55.621 --> 02:05:58.980
<v Speaker 3>progressiveness goddess is ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that everybody's equal.</v>

2778
02:05:59.250 --> 02:06:03.390
<v Speaker 3>They left a woman guarding the door of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the white house by herself.</v>

2779
02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:04.860
<v Speaker 3>This is a true story.</v>

2780
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:08.220
<v Speaker 3>The guy hopped the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was crazy.</v>

2781
02:06:08.221 --> 02:06:12.150
<v Speaker 3>Ptsd down out of his fucking mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>veteran ran across the lawn.</v>

2782
02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:15.900
<v Speaker 3>The guy who was in charge of monitoring</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2783
02:06:15.901 --> 02:06:16.620
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2784
02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:19.080
<v Speaker 3>the grassy area where this guy ran</v>
<v Speaker 3>across,</v>

2785
02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:22.800
<v Speaker 3>took his earpiece out and was on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone with his girlfriend.</v>

2786
02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:26.280
<v Speaker 3>So this guy was like having a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with a girlfriend while</v>

2787
02:06:26.281 --> 02:06:29.370
<v Speaker 3>this guy's running across the lawn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy gets to the front door,</v>

2788
02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:33.270
<v Speaker 3>the alarm system is down because he kept</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking up,</v>

2789
02:06:33.330 --> 02:06:36.900
<v Speaker 3>so they just shut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they left a girl by herself at the</v>

2790
02:06:36.901 --> 02:06:39.660
<v Speaker 3>door with no alarm or a guy just ran</v>
<v Speaker 3>across the lawn.</v>

2791
02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:41.940
<v Speaker 3>Then you find out about the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2792
02:06:41.941 --> 02:06:46.941
<v Speaker 3>the guy turns out was arrested just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of months before this with 800</v>

2793
02:06:48.421 --> 02:06:52.260
<v Speaker 3>fucking rounds of ammunition for like</v>
<v Speaker 3>four rifles,</v>

2794
02:06:52.261 --> 02:06:57.261
<v Speaker 3>two handguns and machete and acts the</v>
<v Speaker 3>arm to the tits with a fucking map of</v>

2795
02:06:58.891 --> 02:07:02.490
<v Speaker 3>Washington dc with an x where the white</v>
<v Speaker 3>house is.</v>

2796
02:07:03.090 --> 02:07:07.170
<v Speaker 3>They weren't watching that guy like they</v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't even watching him.</v>

2797
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:12.910
<v Speaker 3>Like we are dealing with way more in</v>
<v Speaker 3>competence than we would like to believe</v>

2798
02:07:13.620 --> 02:07:14.970
<v Speaker 3>or that we would care to admit.</v>

2799
02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:19.980
<v Speaker 1>So that was the case of a criminal</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigation that the law enforcement</v>

2800
02:07:19.981 --> 02:07:21.300
<v Speaker 1>people didn't coordinate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2801
02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:24.850
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was both that and complete arrogance</v>

2802
02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:28.990
<v Speaker 3>and not having an alarm system on not</v>
<v Speaker 3>having more than one person guarding the</v>

2803
02:07:28.991 --> 02:07:31.510
<v Speaker 3>lawn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not having more than one person at the</v>

2804
02:07:31.511 --> 02:07:33.010
<v Speaker 3>door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a woman at the door,</v>

2805
02:07:33.250 --> 02:07:36.490
<v Speaker 3>like by herself with his fucking giant</v>

2806
02:07:36.490 --> 02:07:39.250
<v Speaker 2>soldier comes running through and</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked her to the ground and runs</v>

2807
02:07:39.251 --> 02:07:41.470
<v Speaker 2>around the white house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say thIs is a perfect example.</v>

2808
02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:44.320
<v Speaker 2>So since that never had happened before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2809
02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:45.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

2810
02:07:45.370 --> 02:07:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe not 100 years of 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 was the last time it happened before</v>

2811
02:07:48.461 --> 02:07:49.060
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2812
02:07:49.060 --> 02:07:50.850
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1912 excuse,</v>

2813
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:52.990
<v Speaker 2>so you're never really ready for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that hasn't happened.</v>

2814
02:07:52.991 --> 02:07:55.660
<v Speaker 2>I always think about if if nuclear war</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke out,</v>

2815
02:07:56.090 --> 02:07:58.240
<v Speaker 2>like let's say Russia and the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States decided,</v>

2816
02:07:58.241 --> 02:08:00.580
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on and we're gonna launch.</v>

2817
02:08:01.150 --> 02:08:04.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they'd work the two bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bombs,</v>

2818
02:08:04.900 --> 02:08:07.450
<v Speaker 2>because we'd never done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we've only tested.</v>

2819
02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:10.720
<v Speaker 2>We've tested the bomb and we've tested</v>
<v Speaker 2>the missile,</v>

2820
02:08:10.990 --> 02:08:14.410
<v Speaker 2>but we haven't tested the missile on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb and the chain of command and who</v>

2821
02:08:14.411 --> 02:08:17.260
<v Speaker 2>puts the codes and sure we've tested all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the parts.</v>

2822
02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:21.640
<v Speaker 2>imagine it was all fucking for gazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>scheme and like there's nothing even in</v>

2823
02:08:21.641 --> 02:08:22.470
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>

2824
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:27.040
<v Speaker 2>I just taken that tax dollars and using</v>
<v Speaker 2>it for satanic rituals and flying on</v>

2825
02:08:27.041 --> 02:08:30.580
<v Speaker 2>private jets everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you read all that stuff?</v>

2826
02:08:30.581 --> 02:08:35.581
<v Speaker 2>That podesta stuff that came out in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wiki leaks emails about all the weird</v>

2827
02:08:35.801 --> 02:08:40.801
<v Speaker 2>rituals they were going to the spirit</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooking involved sperm and blood and why</v>

2828
02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:47.520
<v Speaker 2>in the fuck are they doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to believe when Alex Jones</v>

2835
02:09:02.050 --> 02:09:05.480
<v Speaker 2>where you know some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing satan rituals like this</v>

2836

<v Speaker 2>called spirit cooking.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but you heard the explanation.</v>

2838

<v Speaker 2>So the explanation was the woman who I</v>

2839
02:09:17.201 --> 02:09:19.570
<v Speaker 2>guess was the hostess says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

2840
02:09:19.571 --> 02:09:22.030
<v Speaker 2>it does mean those other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've sort of,</v>

2841
02:09:22.090 --> 02:09:25.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cutely just generalized it to whatever</v>

2842
02:09:25.001 --> 02:09:25.640
<v Speaker 2>we're doing.</v>

2843
02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:26.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the spirit,</v>

2844
02:09:26.681 --> 02:09:28.070
<v Speaker 2>carole king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but didn't meet any of that.</v>

2845
02:09:28.150 --> 02:09:30.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that for a second.</v>

2846
02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:34.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I buy that they were all</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting together to eat blood and sperm.</v>

2847
02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:36.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are they even talking about it?</v>

2848
02:09:36.430 --> 02:09:38.710
<v Speaker 2>My friends and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we never get together and talk about</v>

2849
02:09:38.850 --> 02:09:39.880
<v Speaker 2>blood and sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2850
02:09:39.881 --> 02:09:41.380
<v Speaker 2>never comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't talk about it,</v>

2851
02:09:41.381 --> 02:09:42.191
<v Speaker 2>but somebody did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2852
02:09:42.191 --> 02:09:44.440
<v Speaker 2>the email just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to go to the spirit cooking</v>

2853
02:09:44.441 --> 02:09:44.891
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2854
02:09:44.891 --> 02:09:47.680
<v Speaker 2>But then when you find out what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>spirit cooking is and involves blood and</v>

2855
02:09:47.681 --> 02:09:48.340
<v Speaker 2>sperm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2856
02:09:48.340 --> 02:09:51.850
<v Speaker 2>was one of the things that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is there a good party by the way?</v>

2857
02:09:53.250 --> 02:09:57.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not a party until somebody believes</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many bleeds and somebody comes.</v>

2858
02:09:57.910 --> 02:10:00.550
<v Speaker 2>I didn't look into the explanation</v>
<v Speaker 2>because to me it's one of those things</v>

2859
02:10:00.551 --> 02:10:05.290
<v Speaker 2>that I don't want to know any further</v>
<v Speaker 2>pat because it's too fun to think these</v>

2860
02:10:05.291 --> 02:10:09.400
<v Speaker 2>wacky fucks are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a puck bucket of blood and drinking</v>

2861
02:10:09.401 --> 02:10:13.930
<v Speaker 2>it and throwing it on themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's more fun to me than rational</v>

2862
02:10:13.931 --> 02:10:15.820
<v Speaker 2>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the best moment of the whole</v>

2863
02:10:15.821 --> 02:10:20.821
<v Speaker 2>year was related to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a mike cernovich was tweeting</v>

2864
02:10:20.981 --> 02:10:23.050
<v Speaker 2>about it the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I realized that,</v>

2865
02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:28.270
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the Washington post ran a</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece by piece sort of explaining why it</v>

2866
02:10:28.271 --> 02:10:30.220
<v Speaker 2>wasn't what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

2867
02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:33.470
<v Speaker 2>where have we come to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 2>mike cernovich makes,</v>

2868
02:10:33.770 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2869
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:35.910
<v Speaker 3>the Washington post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2870
02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:40.540
<v Speaker 3>defend how much sperm pedesta it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2871
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:42.980
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was way less burden than you think.</v>

2872
02:10:43.460 --> 02:10:47.090
<v Speaker 3>It was a couple of drops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all you need.</v>

2873
02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:49.010
<v Speaker 3>That's all you need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A couple of drops.</v>

2874
02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:50.870
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a symbolic thing.</v>

2875
02:10:52.330 --> 02:10:55.220
<v Speaker 3>this is totally unrelated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but did you see the real sports from</v>

2876
02:10:55.221 --> 02:10:59.290

2878

<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

2879
02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:04.690
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he uh,</v>

2880
02:11:04.730 --> 02:11:07.700
<v Speaker 3>did this real sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of his episodes,</v>

2881
02:11:07.701 --> 02:11:12.230
<v Speaker 3>he had this woman go away and</v>
<v Speaker 3>investigate a beaker from knowing,</v>

2882
02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:15.440
<v Speaker 3>I think his name is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy that's the lead of bikram</v>

2883
02:11:15.441 --> 02:11:20.441
<v Speaker 3>yoga and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently he's allegedly banged a bunch</v>

2884
02:11:20.571 --> 02:11:23.570
<v Speaker 3>of chicks that work there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexually harassed him,</v>

2885
02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:25.160
<v Speaker 3>allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allegedly,</v>

2886
02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:28.250
<v Speaker 3>allegedly keep saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was,</v>

2887
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:29.660
<v Speaker 3>they were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

2888
02:11:29.661 --> 02:11:34.661
<v Speaker 3>why would I do that when women will pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>$1 for one drop of my sperm saying he</v>

2889
02:11:36.350 --> 02:11:37.183
<v Speaker 3>was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2890
02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:41.510
<v Speaker 3>he was saying there's thousands of women</v>
<v Speaker 3>signing up to fuck him and that four of</v>

2891
02:11:41.511 --> 02:11:44.660
<v Speaker 3>them committed suicide because he</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't fuck them and that people are</v>

2892
02:11:44.661 --> 02:11:47.720
<v Speaker 3>willing to pay a million dollars for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>drop of his sperm.</v>

2893
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:52.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're out there folks.</v>

2894
02:11:52.850 --> 02:11:55.460
<v Speaker 3>That's a good argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some crazy fucking people out</v>

2895
02:11:55.461 --> 02:11:56.960
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have defended myself</v>

2896
02:11:56.961 --> 02:11:57.920
<v Speaker 3>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

2897
02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:00.230
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the women who come here for yoga,</v>

2898
02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:03.080
<v Speaker 3>they were very flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's money laundering right there.</v>

2899
02:12:03.230 --> 02:12:06.350
<v Speaker 3>Someone's paying a million dollars for</v>
<v Speaker 3>his sperm for one drop of sperm.</v>

2900
02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:08.810
<v Speaker 3>That's a guy who's selling drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get rid of cash,</v>

2901
02:12:08.930 --> 02:12:11.450
<v Speaker 3>is trying to move some money around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he's doing.</v>

2902
02:12:11.930 --> 02:12:14.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's the ultimate telecommuting</v>

2903
02:12:14.241 --> 02:12:15.020
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2904
02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:17.600
<v Speaker 3>I can't come to the office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be home today.</v>

2905
02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:19.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is a gallon today?</v>

2906
02:12:20.090 --> 02:12:21.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one drop.</v>

2907
02:12:21.051 --> 02:12:23.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a lot of drops if you're.</v>

2908
02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:26.240
<v Speaker 3>If you're healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you eat eggs and drink milk.</v>

2909
02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:30.290
<v Speaker 3>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My point being that there's a lot of</v>

2910
02:12:30.291 --> 02:12:33.020
<v Speaker 3>fucking crazy people in this world and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

2911
02:12:33.021 --> 02:12:36.830
<v Speaker 3>podesta guy being involved in this wacky</v>
<v Speaker 3>spirit cooking thing.</v>

2912
02:12:37.700 --> 02:12:39.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm not shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not shocked.</v>

2913
02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:42.380
<v Speaker 3>This yoga guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy that you think of as being like</v>

2914
02:12:42.381 --> 02:12:47.381
<v Speaker 3>peace and sot nom and not my stay and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all going to flow together and</v>

2915
02:12:47.541 --> 02:12:48.770
<v Speaker 3>realize we're all want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2916
02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:53.450
<v Speaker 3>I did pay $1,000,000 for one drop of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>spam.</v>

2917
02:12:53.690 --> 02:12:56.390
<v Speaker 3>He suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's crazy and he's the head of this</v>

2918
02:12:56.391 --> 02:12:59.540
<v Speaker 3>yoga organization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we all think we immediately</v>

2919
02:12:59.541 --> 02:13:04.541
<v Speaker 3>associate yoga with peace and love and</v>
<v Speaker 3>happiness and he's talking about all</v>

2920
02:13:05.121 --> 02:13:09.950
<v Speaker 3>these women that accused them of being</v>
<v Speaker 3>human trash and pieces of shit and it's</v>

2921
02:13:09.951 --> 02:13:11.240
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

2922
02:13:11.241 --> 02:13:16.241
<v Speaker 3>Like think about how trump responded to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the allegations against him versus how</v>

2923
02:13:17.331 --> 02:13:22.331
<v Speaker 3>this yoga guy responded way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He should have gone with a nickname</v>

2924
02:13:23.810 --> 02:13:28.160
<v Speaker 3>lying yoga hose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we call them,</v>

2925
02:13:28.850 --> 02:13:33.850
<v Speaker 3>but my point is that there's some crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>people out there involved in all sorts</v>

2926
02:13:34.111 --> 02:13:35.880
<v Speaker 3>of weird stuff where you would never</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine.</v>

2927
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:39.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also gets to the fact that I just tie</v>

2928
02:13:39.221 --> 02:13:44.040
<v Speaker 3>that together pretending I had a point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it kind of goes to the point where</v>

2929
02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:47.610
<v Speaker 3>we'll never have a nice person who is</v>
<v Speaker 3>president again.</v>

2930
02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:48.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's true.</v>

2931
02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:50.610
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because the only reason you thought</v>

2932
02:13:50.611 --> 02:13:52.800
<v Speaker 3>anybody was nice and he didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough about them,</v>

2933
02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:54.810
<v Speaker 3>but that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is nice people,</v>

2934
02:13:54.811 --> 02:13:55.644
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a nice guy.</v>

2935
02:13:55.670 --> 02:13:57.630
<v Speaker 3>Don't you run for president?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a nice guy.</v>

2936
02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:00.900
<v Speaker 3>But if you were to dissect my entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>paSt,</v>

2937
02:14:01.170 --> 02:14:02.280
<v Speaker 3>I would look like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2938
02:14:02.281 --> 02:14:04.800
<v Speaker 3>satan incarnate by the time they got</v>
<v Speaker 3>done with me,</v>

2939
02:14:04.890 --> 02:14:08.520
<v Speaker 3>maybe now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think within the next four years,</v>

2940
02:14:08.580 --> 02:14:12.660
<v Speaker 3>by the time trump is a on a second term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he decides to run again,</v>

2941
02:14:12.740 --> 02:14:13.890
<v Speaker 3>and if he wins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2942
02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:14.880
<v Speaker 3>Which would be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2943
02:14:15.210 --> 02:14:17.340
<v Speaker 3>To term trump who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a shirt.</v>

2944
02:14:17.610 --> 02:14:18.270
<v Speaker 3>I see it.</v>

2945
02:14:18.270 --> 02:14:20.280
<v Speaker 3>I see a bumper sticker now to term</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

2946
02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:21.740
<v Speaker 3>Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>

2947
02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:22.321
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>

2948
02:14:22.321 --> 02:14:23.910
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you guys start chanting that</v>

2949
02:14:23.911 --> 02:14:24.744
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want credit.</v>

2950
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:25.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came up with it,</v>

2951
02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:30.000
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really could see that by that time it</v>

2952
02:14:30.001 --> 02:14:32.310
<v Speaker 3>will be way more difficult to just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2953
02:14:32.311 --> 02:14:35.850
<v Speaker 3>we were going to have to acknowledge</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can't just edit little pieces</v>

2954
02:14:35.851 --> 02:14:38.670
<v Speaker 3>of someone's life and make some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2955
02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:43.080
<v Speaker 3>an absolute definitive statement on who</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are based on out of context</v>

2956
02:14:43.110 --> 02:14:46.530
<v Speaker 3>statements and things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also this idea that like something</v>

2957
02:14:46.531 --> 02:14:51.531
<v Speaker 3>you did in 2001 somehow defines you in</v>
<v Speaker 3>2016 and you're the same person,</v>

2958
02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:55.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't the point of life to improve 100</v>

2959
02:14:55.801 --> 02:15:00.801
<v Speaker 3>percent to say trump did terrible things</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 years ago and I think that what's he</v>

2960
02:15:01.501 --> 02:15:04.050
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's trying to do things good for the</v>

2961
02:15:04.051 --> 02:15:05.580
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that like the arc?</v>

2962
02:15:05.580 --> 02:15:08.370
<v Speaker 3>We're all supposed to be on where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to be kind of a,</v>

2963
02:15:08.470 --> 02:15:09.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a good person,</v>

2964
02:15:09.631 --> 02:15:10.560
<v Speaker 3>but you're getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2965
02:15:10.561 --> 02:15:13.500
<v Speaker 3>we would hope they used to be a really</v>
<v Speaker 3>good person and now you're a god.</v>

2966
02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:15.360
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2967
02:15:15.361 --> 02:15:17.550
<v Speaker 3>anybody like tHat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>

2968
02:15:17.970 --> 02:15:22.680
<v Speaker 3>I want someone who is perfect in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>nineties and is now transcended humanity</v>

2969
02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:25.020
<v Speaker 3>and is ready to lead because that's what</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need.</v>

2970
02:15:25.021 --> 02:15:27.220
<v Speaker 3>We can't have people leading anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need some,</v>

2971
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:30.630
<v Speaker 3>a real guru.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to go the full cult?</v>

2972
02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:34.080
<v Speaker 3>Turn this nation into a cult?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2973
02:15:34.081 --> 02:15:35.730
<v Speaker 3>we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll see what donald wanted.</v>

2974
02:15:35.870 --> 02:15:36.660
<v Speaker 3>The full.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>

2975
02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:40.650
<v Speaker 3>I think we Haven't completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>unrealistic expectation as far as</v>

2976
02:15:40.651 --> 02:15:43.080
<v Speaker 3>someone who would put it like jfk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2977
02:15:43.110 --> 02:15:44.670
<v Speaker 3>Perfect example that everyone always</v>
<v Speaker 3>uses.</v>

2978
02:15:44.671 --> 02:15:47.310
<v Speaker 3>If he was running today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd be picked apart.</v>

2979
02:15:47.311 --> 02:15:48.810
<v Speaker 3>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another perfect example.</v>

2980
02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:51.320
<v Speaker 3>If you look at him on paper as far as</v>
<v Speaker 3>policy,</v>

2981
02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:54.900
<v Speaker 3>take out the monica lewinsky scandal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just look at what he's done with the</v>

2982
02:15:54.930 --> 02:15:58.110
<v Speaker 3>economy was like during this time and</v>
<v Speaker 3>make your arguments plus or minus that</v>

2983
02:15:58.111 --> 02:16:00.330
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how much of it was because of</v>

2984
02:16:00.331 --> 02:16:02.250
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of it was he was in a lucky</v>

2985
02:16:02.251 --> 02:16:04.080
<v Speaker 3>spot as far as being a president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2986
02:16:04.081 --> 02:16:07.830
<v Speaker 3>There's those Arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you look at him like that and you</v>

2987
02:16:07.831 --> 02:16:08.330
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2988
02:16:08.330 --> 02:16:12.330
<v Speaker 3>there's thIs guy who was a great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then either Jennifer Flowers in</v>

2989
02:16:12.331 --> 02:16:15.090
<v Speaker 3>Nepal on jones and the this and that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different.</v>

2990
02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:17.610
<v Speaker 3>Then you have a totally different idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>of who this guy really is.</v>

2991
02:16:18.210 --> 02:16:20.730
<v Speaker 3>The truth is probably somewhere in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>middle,</v>

2992
02:16:20.820 --> 02:16:22.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2993
02:16:22.291 --> 02:16:27.291
<v Speaker 3>And and the technology for forming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forming opinions that are incorrect</v>

2994
02:16:27.870 --> 02:16:30.000
<v Speaker 3>about your opponent is just better than</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ever</v>

2995
02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.620
<v Speaker 2>been because now they can test that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff in real time.</v>

2996
02:16:33.050 --> 02:16:37.720
<v Speaker 2>They can put down several ads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You clicks on what and test the</v>

2997
02:16:37.721 --> 02:16:38.554
<v Speaker 2>persuasion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2998
02:16:38.770 --> 02:16:43.770
<v Speaker 2>so the best persuader of 20 fIve years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago was an amateur compared to the best</v>

2999
02:16:45.041 --> 02:16:48.580
<v Speaker 2>persuader in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder about that because I think that</v>

3000
02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:53.500
<v Speaker 2>jfk was a fucking magnificent persuader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen jfk speech about</v>

3001
02:16:53.501 --> 02:16:55.600
<v Speaker 2>secret societies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3002
02:16:55.601 --> 02:16:57.100
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would agree.</v>

3003
02:16:57.101 --> 02:16:59.650
<v Speaker 2>he was great for television because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was great on television.</v>

3004
02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had an incredible speech about secret</v>

3005
02:17:02.741 --> 02:17:07.420
<v Speaker 2>societies and the importance of not</v>
<v Speaker 2>having secret societies and government</v>

3006
02:17:07.810 --> 02:17:08.800
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3007
02:17:08.810 --> 02:17:10.480
<v Speaker 2>it was really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this day,</v>

3008
02:17:10.481 --> 02:17:14.170
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those ones that conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 2>theorists loved bring out and go,</v>

3009
02:17:14.290 --> 02:17:15.430
<v Speaker 2>this is why they killed him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

3010
02:17:15.610 --> 02:17:18.490
<v Speaker 2>This is why they killed because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may very well be that,</v>

3011
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:21.940
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about the importance of</v>

3012
02:17:21.941 --> 02:17:26.941
<v Speaker 2>transparency amongst the government and</v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst the people and how dangerous it</v>

3013
02:17:27.371 --> 02:17:29.710
<v Speaker 2>is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hide secrets and have secret</v>

3014
02:17:29.711 --> 02:17:30.130
<v Speaker 2>societies.</v>

3015
02:17:30.130 --> 02:17:33.520
<v Speaker 2>And it's incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly brilliant.</v>

3016
02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:35.980
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing because you couldn't</v>

3017
02:17:35.981 --> 02:17:39.850
<v Speaker 2>imagine a president saying that today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3018
02:17:40.210 --> 02:17:44.410
<v Speaker 2>do you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was an eisenhower that had</v>

3019
02:17:44.411 --> 02:17:47.830
<v Speaker 2>the speech about the military industrial</v>
<v Speaker 2>complex before he left office,</v>

3020
02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:48.251
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3021
02:17:48.251 --> 02:17:49.270
<v Speaker 2>it was eisenhower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3022
02:17:49.980 --> 02:17:53.710
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a speech that he gave one</v>

3023
02:17:53.711 --> 02:17:56.800
<v Speaker 2>night that no one ever saw again until</v>
<v Speaker 2>the internet came around.</v>

3024
02:17:57.090 --> 02:17:59.650
<v Speaker 2>Like it wasn't something you were played</v>
<v Speaker 2>in school.</v>

3025
02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:03.350
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't something you even aware about</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably until youtube came along and</v>

3026
02:18:03.351 --> 02:18:05.890
<v Speaker 2>then you watched that thing on youtube</v>
<v Speaker 2>where eisenhower saying,</v>

3027
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:09.700
<v Speaker 2>we must be fearful of the military</v>
<v Speaker 2>industrial complex.</v>

3028
02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:12.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he waS basically saying there's a whole</v>

3029
02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:15.370
<v Speaker 2>machine that wants to go to war and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're looking for excuses to go to</v>

3030
02:18:15.371 --> 02:18:17.320
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he named it,</v>

3031
02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:20.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he called it this thing that you would</v>

3032
02:18:20.831 --> 02:18:22.360
<v Speaker 2>never fucking see that today.</v>

3033
02:18:22.510 --> 02:18:25.990
<v Speaker 2>You would never see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kennedy did and what eisenhower</v>

3034
02:18:25.991 --> 02:18:28.570
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like they've buttoned down</v>

3035
02:18:28.571 --> 02:18:31.600
<v Speaker 2>those holes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found out where those issues were</v>

3036
02:18:31.630 --> 02:18:33.790
<v Speaker 2>in the difference in the what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3037
02:18:33.970 --> 02:18:36.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the people that are actually</v>

3038
02:18:36.311 --> 02:18:41.311
<v Speaker 2>running the government want to direct</v>
<v Speaker 2>into project versus these mouthpieces.</v>

3039
02:18:44.110 --> 02:18:48.400
<v Speaker 2>These guys like eisenhower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kennedy now it sort of the military,</v>

3040
02:18:48.401 --> 02:18:52.680
<v Speaker 2>industrial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media conglomerates,</v>

3041
02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:54.670
<v Speaker 2>because they all seem to be on the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>side right now.</v>

3042
02:18:55.390 --> 02:18:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but aren't the.</v>

3043
02:18:56.871 --> 02:18:59.560
<v Speaker 2>And different sites like fox is</v>
<v Speaker 2>different than cnn.</v>

3044
02:18:59.561 --> 02:19:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well fox Is sort of by itself.</v>

3045
02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching fox and cnn back and</v>

3046
02:19:05.081 --> 02:19:08.020
<v Speaker 2>forth before the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like before the election I was just</v>

3047
02:19:08.130 --> 02:19:11.950
<v Speaker 2>going to watch fox for like an hour and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'd switch over to cnn for an hour</v>

3048
02:19:11.951 --> 02:19:13.450
<v Speaker 2>and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was getting schizophrenia.</v>

3049
02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:16.750
<v Speaker 2>So if you seen how a reality as</v>
<v Speaker 2>bifurcated,</v>

3050
02:19:16.810 --> 02:19:20.170
<v Speaker 2>so if he switched between fox and cnn</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fox,</v>

3051
02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:25.200
<v Speaker 2>the trump transition team is doing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrific job picking real adults,</v>

3052
02:19:26.030 --> 02:19:26.471
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

3053
02:19:26.471 --> 02:19:27.130
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

3054
02:19:27.130 --> 02:19:29.180
<v Speaker 2>You go over to cnn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's chaos.</v>

3055
02:19:29.450 --> 02:19:29.991
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3056
02:19:29.991 --> 02:19:30.690
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3057
02:19:30.690 --> 02:19:33.500
<v Speaker 2>there's just this big cluster fog going</v>
<v Speaker 2>over there and everything's falling</v>

3058
02:19:33.501 --> 02:19:34.760
<v Speaker 2>apart of the country is going to fall</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>

3059
02:19:35.570 --> 02:19:39.560
<v Speaker 2>They have access to the same information</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I know.</v>

3060
02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are two completely different</v>

3061
02:19:42.621 --> 02:19:44.510
<v Speaker 2>views of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3062
02:19:44.511 --> 02:19:46.550
<v Speaker 2>There's two completely different views</v>
<v Speaker 2>of reality.</v>

3063
02:19:46.551 --> 02:19:47.520
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3064
02:19:47.550 --> 02:19:51.860
<v Speaker 2>if I've gone to some liberal sites</v>
<v Speaker 2>websites that are urging people to</v>

3065
02:19:51.861 --> 02:19:56.270
<v Speaker 2>contact the electoral college and block</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump's rise to power,</v>

3066
02:19:56.630 --> 02:20:01.630
<v Speaker 2>like what is that even possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how isn't that anti-democratic like</v>

3067
02:20:02.350 --> 02:20:04.670
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a few people contact the</v>

3068
02:20:04.671 --> 02:20:07.110
<v Speaker 2>electoral college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like you're talking about like</v>

3069
02:20:07.130 --> 02:20:09.770
<v Speaker 2>the representatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like every state picture representative,</v>

3070
02:20:09.771 --> 02:20:11.570
<v Speaker 2>that representative is supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>represent the state.</v>

3071
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:14.930
<v Speaker 2>They almost always do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have this sort of weird hidden</v>

3072
02:20:14.931 --> 02:20:17.050
<v Speaker 2>power where they could kind of change</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3073
02:20:17.110 --> 02:20:20.150
<v Speaker 2>like if California voted for clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they said fuck that.</v>

3074
02:20:20.180 --> 02:20:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone actually did decide to</v>

3075
02:20:22.851 --> 02:20:24.140
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some crazy delicate.</v>

3076
02:20:24.210 --> 02:20:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So apparently that power is</v>

3077
02:20:26.121 --> 02:20:30.440
<v Speaker 2>intentionally built in just to prevent a</v>
<v Speaker 2>monster from being,</v>

3078
02:20:30.530 --> 02:20:31.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

3079
02:20:31.281 --> 02:20:32.130
<v Speaker 2>weren't elected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3080
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:33.320
<v Speaker 2>it didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't work.</v>

3081
02:20:33.690 --> 02:20:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what people are saying like</v>

3082
02:20:35.481 --> 02:20:37.490
<v Speaker 2>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that would be,</v>

3083
02:20:37.700 --> 02:20:40.310
<v Speaker 2>there would be a revolt in this country</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they ever did that.</v>

3084
02:20:40.580 --> 02:20:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Good lord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they think it's bad now the</v>

3085
02:20:42.861 --> 02:20:44.210
<v Speaker 2>divisiveness and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3086
02:20:44.211 --> 02:20:44.780
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3087
02:20:44.780 --> 02:20:49.100
<v Speaker 2>the angst and this fucking weird line in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sand across.</v>

3088
02:20:49.410 --> 02:20:51.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost civil war style,</v>

3089
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:53.570
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin between the right and the left</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

3090
02:20:54.320 --> 02:20:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of that might be exaggerated by the</v>

3091
02:20:56.631 --> 02:20:59.510
<v Speaker 2>media as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be accentuated.</v>

3092
02:20:59.660 --> 02:21:00.493
<v Speaker 2>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

3093
02:21:00.600 --> 02:21:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're blowing on that fire with the</v>

3094
02:21:04.431 --> 02:21:05.510
<v Speaker 2>protesters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be out there.</v>

3095
02:21:05.511 --> 02:21:07.670
<v Speaker 2>If it wasn't an intellivision do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

3096
02:21:07.671 --> 02:21:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your opinion on the protest,</v>

3097
02:21:09.501 --> 02:21:10.070
<v Speaker 2>do you think?</v>

3098
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:12.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen ads where they said they would</v>

3099
02:21:12.261 --> 02:21:15.380
<v Speaker 2>pay people 35 bucks an hour to protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that true or is that bullshit?</v>

3100
02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:17.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

3101
02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:22.430
<v Speaker 2>I would say low credibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had heard that you can't snopes things</v>

3102
02:21:22.431 --> 02:21:25.210
<v Speaker 2>anymore because snopes leans towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>hillary.</v>

3103
02:21:25.250 --> 02:21:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear that too.</v>

3104
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:29.480
<v Speaker 2>But where do you hear it though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>From snopes?</v>

3105
02:21:29.490 --> 02:21:33.170
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know either outright forums and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I would say,</v>

3106
02:21:33.410 --> 02:21:35.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one is grain of salt,</v>

3107
02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:39.590
<v Speaker 2>but there certainly are things that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>subject to interpretation for sure.</v>

3108
02:21:39.770 --> 02:21:41.570
<v Speaker 2>So you got to figure there's some bias</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

3109
02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:43.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if people are really getting</v>

3110
02:21:43.371 --> 02:21:45.390
<v Speaker 2>paid to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

3111
02:21:45.610 --> 02:21:48.170
<v Speaker 2>to protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems like a good gig if you're</v>

3112
02:21:48.171 --> 02:21:48.971
<v Speaker 2>broke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

3113
02:21:48.971 --> 02:21:52.410
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just assumed to be true on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right doors.</v>

3114
02:21:52.520 --> 02:21:55.130
<v Speaker 2>They think that this is proven and lots</v>
<v Speaker 2>of different ways.</v>

3115
02:21:55.360 --> 02:21:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was in New York,</v>

3116
02:21:56.830 --> 02:21:58.040
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may be.</v>

3117
02:21:58.040 --> 02:22:02.090
<v Speaker 2>There was thousands and thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>oscar winning actors wandering the</v>

3118
02:22:02.091 --> 02:22:03.920
<v Speaker 2>streets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but honestly,</v>

3119
02:22:03.980 --> 02:22:06.290
<v Speaker 2>to me it didn't seem like anybody was</v>
<v Speaker 2>acting.</v>

3120
02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:09.080
<v Speaker 2>It didn't seem like anybody was a paid</v>
<v Speaker 2>performer.</v>

3121
02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:10.273
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't.</v>

3122
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Most of them could be naturals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you need a core that gets everybody</v>

3123
02:22:14.691 --> 02:22:15.410
<v Speaker 2>excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3124
02:22:15.410 --> 02:22:17.930
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be a core of this shows up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then other people can.</v>

3125
02:22:18.620 --> 02:22:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Or is it that the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to take that 35 bucks an hour,</v>

3126
02:22:22.641 --> 02:22:25.260
<v Speaker 2>they hated trump anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this gives them an excuse to some</v>

3127
02:22:25.261 --> 02:22:29.370
<v Speaker 2>cash while they're hitting trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this here know someone wasn't</v>

3128
02:22:29.371 --> 02:22:32.850
<v Speaker 2>paid $3,500 to protest Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fake news,</v>

3129
02:22:33.780 --> 02:22:36.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>created by paul horner who post fake</v>

3130
02:22:36.961 --> 02:22:39.050
<v Speaker 2>news and a variety of websites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3131
02:22:39.060 --> 02:22:41.580
<v Speaker 2>how dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took credit for the fake news.</v>

3132
02:22:41.610 --> 02:22:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

3133
02:22:42.930 --> 02:22:44.850
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his followers don't fact check anything.</v>

3134
02:22:44.850 --> 02:22:47.100
<v Speaker 2>They'll post everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe anything warner said,</v>

3135
02:22:47.390 --> 02:22:49.620
<v Speaker 2>referring to then trump's campaign</v>
<v Speaker 2>manager,</v>

3136
02:22:49.621 --> 02:22:53.100
<v Speaker 2>corey lewandowski,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horner said his campaign manager posted</v>

3137
02:22:53.101 --> 02:22:56.160
<v Speaker 2>my story about a protest getting paid</v>
<v Speaker 2>$3,500 as a fact.</v>

3138
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:59.210
<v Speaker 2>Like I made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I posted it in a fake ad on craig's</v>

3139
02:22:59.211 --> 02:23:01.710
<v Speaker 2>list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a screenshot of those since</v>

3140
02:23:01.711 --> 02:23:02.311
<v Speaker 2>deleted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tweet.</v>

3141
02:23:02.311 --> 02:23:05.160
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm glad I said low credibility</v>

3142
02:23:05.161 --> 02:23:07.830
<v Speaker 2>before you showed that that makes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would have been really</v>

3143
02:23:07.831 --> 02:23:10.110
<v Speaker 2>embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The amount of money you'd have to have</v>

3144
02:23:10.170 --> 02:23:14.640
<v Speaker 2>to pay thousands of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty five bucks an hour.</v>

3145
02:23:15.150 --> 02:23:16.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that supports the.</v>

3146
02:23:16.350 --> 02:23:21.030
<v Speaker 2>George soros is behind everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm pretty skeptical about.</v>

3147
02:23:21.390 --> 02:23:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3148
02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:26.760
<v Speaker 2>what about that peter thiel billionaire</v>
<v Speaker 2>character that funded the lawsuit</v>

3149
02:23:26.761 --> 02:23:28.980
<v Speaker 2>against gawker?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't he in some way,</v>

3150
02:23:28.981 --> 02:23:33.950
<v Speaker 2>shape or form a part of the team?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's part of the trump transitions.</v>

3151
02:23:34.420 --> 02:23:36.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's technically on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>transition team.</v>

3152
02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all very interesting.</v>

3153
02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:40.920
<v Speaker 2>It's very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there goes the anti gay thing.</v>

3154
02:23:41.370 --> 02:23:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Wherever you seen any evidence that he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti gay,</v>

3155
02:23:43.770 --> 02:23:46.680
<v Speaker 2>that trump's anti gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not sure what they're even looking</v>

3156
02:23:46.681 --> 02:23:51.240
<v Speaker 2>at except that he picked a pence as his</v>
<v Speaker 2>running mate in penn says stuff of this</v>

3157
02:23:51.241 --> 02:23:51.871
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3158
02:23:51.871 --> 02:23:54.090
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has some stuff that I tweeted the</v>

3159
02:23:54.091 --> 02:23:57.960
<v Speaker 2>other day that rachel maddow was</v>
<v Speaker 2>highlighting that he was saying that</v>

3160
02:23:57.961 --> 02:23:59.790
<v Speaker 2>instead of giving money to aids</v>
<v Speaker 2>research,</v>

3161
02:23:59.791 --> 02:24:03.270
<v Speaker 2>you should give money to educate gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>people about the risks of their</v>

3162
02:24:03.290 --> 02:24:04.950
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3163
02:24:05.310 --> 02:24:07.050
<v Speaker 2>so ears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I think's going to happen.</v>

3164
02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:10.320
<v Speaker 2>If you want to put this in the positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

3165
02:24:11.490 --> 02:24:15.960
<v Speaker 2>the vice president will adopt the</v>
<v Speaker 2>president's policies,</v>

3166
02:24:15.961 --> 02:24:19.080
<v Speaker 2>at least in public by the time mike</v>
<v Speaker 2>pence,</v>

3167
02:24:19.510 --> 02:24:23.610
<v Speaker 2>he might run for president or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My guess is that it will be hard coded.</v>

3168
02:24:23.700 --> 02:24:26.370
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this gives them an opportunity to evolve</v>

3169
02:24:26.730 --> 02:24:29.010
<v Speaker 2>to where the country you would find him</v>
<v Speaker 2>more acceptable.</v>

3170
02:24:29.011 --> 02:24:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show do you want to do that?</v>

3171
02:24:31.050 --> 02:24:34.950
<v Speaker 2>And it's sort of a what I call the fake</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it gives them an excuse to do it</v>

3172
02:24:34.951 --> 02:24:36.750
<v Speaker 2>without being a hypocrite because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

3173
02:24:37.020 --> 02:24:38.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to do that because he's your</v>

3174
02:24:38.881 --> 02:24:39.890
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3175
02:24:40.230 --> 02:24:44.160
<v Speaker 2>now that's just your policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my guess is that trump is moving a</v>

3176
02:24:44.161 --> 02:24:47.280
<v Speaker 2>lot of people to the middle because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where he is,</v>

3177
02:24:48.020 --> 02:24:51.900
<v Speaker 2>but that pence guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not very persuasive.</v>

3178
02:24:52.140 --> 02:24:54.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just really have a hard time seeing</v>

3179
02:24:54.421 --> 02:24:56.820
<v Speaker 2>him as being in god's going to run for</v>
<v Speaker 2>president some day.</v>

3180
02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:58.920
<v Speaker 2>I think he might really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3181
02:24:59.140 --> 02:25:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think as a pick,</v>

3182
02:25:00.850 --> 02:25:04.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I'll say that I'm no fan of his</v>

3183
02:25:04.740 --> 02:25:05.700
<v Speaker 2>history with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3184
02:25:05.701 --> 02:25:08.010
<v Speaker 2>gay rights stuff and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on that team.</v>

3185
02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as a personality on tv,</v>

3186
02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:15.870
<v Speaker 2>like he's really good at interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really sticks and point and the</v>

3187
02:25:15.871 --> 02:25:19.200
<v Speaker 2>only had one thing you needed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was when a debate against the</v>

3188
02:25:19.201 --> 02:25:20.640
<v Speaker 2>other vice president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tim kaine,</v>

3189
02:25:20.670 --> 02:25:22.800
<v Speaker 2>which he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to highs emails though.</v>

3190
02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

3191
02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:25.073
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3192
02:25:25.770 --> 02:25:28.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they would all like to be seen</v>
<v Speaker 3>that though.</v>

3193
02:25:29.370 --> 02:25:30.420
<v Speaker 3>That was the latest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3194
02:25:32.020 --> 02:25:34.480
<v Speaker 3>Like they want access to his emails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3195
02:25:34.481 --> 02:25:37.010
<v Speaker 3>fuck that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3196
02:25:37.690 --> 02:25:39.820
<v Speaker 3>we're waiting for that shoe to drop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows.</v>

3197
02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:41.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to come a time when I think</v>

3198
02:25:41.531 --> 02:25:43.780
<v Speaker 3>we're probably all going to have access</v>
<v Speaker 3>to all of our emails.</v>

3199
02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:44.751
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you,</v>

3200
02:25:44.751 --> 02:25:47.230
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to come to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusion that when you're,</v>

3201
02:25:47.231 --> 02:25:50.650
<v Speaker 3>and you should now really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should think when you're sending an</v>

3202
02:25:50.651 --> 02:25:52.480
<v Speaker 3>email,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should assume that this is not</v>

3203
02:25:52.481 --> 02:25:54.700
<v Speaker 3>really private.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of do already,</v>

3204
02:25:54.970 --> 02:25:57.160
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because someone on the other side who</v>

3205
02:25:57.161 --> 02:25:59.700
<v Speaker 3>gets the Scott Adams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dick pic co,</v>

3206
02:25:59.710 --> 02:26:03.270
<v Speaker 3>we'll check this out and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many out there down and said,</v>

3207
02:26:03.340 --> 02:26:04.090
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

3208
02:26:04.090 --> 02:26:07.070
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like own it to you.</v>

3209
02:26:07.150 --> 02:26:07.750
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3210
02:26:07.750 --> 02:26:08.350
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3211
02:26:08.350 --> 02:26:09.640
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look what charlie sheen did.</v>

3212
02:26:10.030 --> 02:26:11.680
<v Speaker 3>Made a career to own it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've,</v>

3213
02:26:11.681 --> 02:26:15.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've speculated that the perfect world,</v>

3214
02:26:15.281 --> 02:26:18.520
<v Speaker 3>would it be no privacy if everybody knew</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything about everybody?</v>

3215
02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:21.940
<v Speaker 3>The worst world is where most people</v>
<v Speaker 3>have privacy,</v>

3216
02:26:21.941 --> 02:26:25.120
<v Speaker 3>but if people lose it because then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just victim so everybody could</v>

3217
02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:29.470
<v Speaker 3>but hear any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But everybody knew everybody's shit.</v>

3218
02:26:30.130 --> 02:26:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Suddenly you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

3219
02:26:31.781 --> 02:26:33.790
<v Speaker 3>You're terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm terrible too.</v>

3220
02:26:34.060 --> 02:26:36.400
<v Speaker 3>I think it would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we would get used to each other</v>

3221
02:26:36.401 --> 02:26:38.650
<v Speaker 3>so quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it would also force people to</v>

3222
02:26:38.651 --> 02:26:39.490
<v Speaker 3>evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3223
02:26:39.491 --> 02:26:42.040
<v Speaker 3>we all know our best friends stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3224
02:26:42.041 --> 02:26:43.450
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know the,</v>

3225
02:26:43.451 --> 02:26:47.140
<v Speaker 3>the failures and that we all have</v>
<v Speaker 3>together collectively and we still love</v>

3226
02:26:47.141 --> 02:26:49.000
<v Speaker 3>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just like letting those other</v>

3227
02:26:49.001 --> 02:26:51.640
<v Speaker 3>people in on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>letting those strangers in on the time</v>

3228
02:26:51.641 --> 02:26:55.440
<v Speaker 3>that you had did that bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reason you care is that they'll</v>

3229
02:26:55.450 --> 02:26:58.690
<v Speaker 3>think poorly of you and that that will</v>
<v Speaker 3>affect your life,</v>

3230
02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:01.060
<v Speaker 3>but if you have mutually assured</v>
<v Speaker 3>destruction,</v>

3231
02:27:01.090 --> 02:27:04.060
<v Speaker 3>which is that everybody's bad because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know everything about everybody.</v>

3232
02:27:04.580 --> 02:27:06.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's got something they're proud</v>

3233
02:27:06.311 --> 02:27:08.290
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody just thinks,</v>

3234
02:27:08.291 --> 02:27:10.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'll throw a stone because</v>

3235
02:27:10.421 --> 02:27:11.770
<v Speaker 3>it's going to come right back at my</v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

3236
02:27:12.100 --> 02:27:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's step one in this complete</v>

3237
02:27:14.501 --> 02:27:17.680
<v Speaker 3>and total assimilation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think losing privacy.</v>

3238
02:27:17.681 --> 02:27:20.980
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's inevitable whether it's 30</v>

3239
02:27:20.981 --> 02:27:24.430
<v Speaker 3>years from now or 50 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think essentially everything you do</v>

3240
02:27:24.431 --> 02:27:25.490
<v Speaker 3>from then on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to.</v>

3241
02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:29.830
<v Speaker 3>I think there's going to come some form</v>
<v Speaker 3>of technology that is a leap.</v>

3242
02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:31.930
<v Speaker 3>Very much like the internet is this</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy leap,</v>

3243
02:27:31.931 --> 02:27:33.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The internet provides us with this</v>

3244
02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:37.330
<v Speaker 3>incident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tanium access to all the answers to all</v>

3245
02:27:37.331 --> 02:27:40.660
<v Speaker 3>the questions you've ever had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just unprecedented in history.</v>

3246
02:27:40.810 --> 02:27:42.280
<v Speaker 3>There's never been a time where you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3247
02:27:42.281 --> 02:27:45.310
<v Speaker 3>what did happen on the native american</v>
<v Speaker 3>trail of tears?</v>

3248
02:27:45.311 --> 02:27:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it called that?</v>

3249
02:27:46.290 --> 02:27:48.940
<v Speaker 3>You can just fucking open your phone to</v>
<v Speaker 3>sit down for a few hours,</v>

3250
02:27:49.180 --> 02:27:51.070
<v Speaker 3>and then I came back to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would he got for me,</v>

3251
02:27:51.071 --> 02:27:53.380
<v Speaker 3>Scott?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could tell me like exactly wHat the</v>

3252
02:27:53.381 --> 02:27:56.260
<v Speaker 3>fuck went down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like unprecedented stuff,</v>

3253
02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:00.100
<v Speaker 3>I think in that leap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think we're in the middle of.</v>

3254
02:28:00.101 --> 02:28:02.920
<v Speaker 3>So it seems like it's not as big of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal as it really is.</v>

3255
02:28:02.930 --> 02:28:06.490
<v Speaker 3>Like there's going to be another leap</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's even more speCtacular than that</v>

3256
02:28:06.610 --> 02:28:09.430
<v Speaker 3>and that leap is going to integrate all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our minds together.</v>

3257
02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:12.190
<v Speaker 3>It's going to integrate our memories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to integrate our ability to</v>

3258
02:28:12.191 --> 02:28:16.630
<v Speaker 3>communicate and we will literally are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to become a technologically</v>

3259
02:28:17.620 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 3>technologically created hive mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might've written a book that</v>

3260
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:25.730
<v Speaker 2>has something to say about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm god's debris.</v>

3261
02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the idea behind your book?</v>

3262
02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:32.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I told you it would ruin your book</v>

3263
02:28:32.421 --> 02:28:35.170
<v Speaker 2>reading experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but spoiler alert,</v>

3264
02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:36.740
<v Speaker 2>can you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3265
02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:41.270
<v Speaker 2>but I will say that I've had this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought using periscope because when I'm</v>

3266
02:28:41.271 --> 02:28:44.810
<v Speaker 2>using periscope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike the conscious mind of this</v>

3267
02:28:44.811 --> 02:28:47.420
<v Speaker 2>gigantic brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is all the people watching me,</v>

3268
02:28:47.780 --> 02:28:50.360
<v Speaker 2>so I can say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3269
02:28:50.361 --> 02:28:52.550
<v Speaker 2>I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this law might go into effect.</v>

3270
02:28:52.580 --> 02:28:53.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the answer to that.</v>

3271
02:28:53.901 --> 02:28:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Somebody tells me what the law is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And within three seconds a period on my</v>

3272
02:28:57.981 --> 02:29:01.370
<v Speaker 2>screen in the periscope session will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who knows the answer that.</v>

3273
02:29:01.580 --> 02:29:06.340
<v Speaker 2>And there's almost nothing I can't throw</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there that there isn't someone under</v>

3274
02:29:06.350 --> 02:29:08.690
<v Speaker 2>the thousands of people who were alive</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that moment.</v>

3275
02:29:08.900 --> 02:29:11.160
<v Speaker 2>And it's the live part that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting because you can,</v>

3276
02:29:11.210 --> 02:29:12.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the internet is kind of like one</v>

3277
02:29:12.951 --> 02:29:14.570
<v Speaker 2>person's alive and the others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3278
02:29:14.571 --> 02:29:16.430
<v Speaker 2>looking at data on the other side.</v>

3279
02:29:17.180 --> 02:29:20.750
<v Speaker 2>but when it's live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are contributing to a thought</v>

3280
02:29:20.900 --> 02:29:23.780
<v Speaker 2>and you're watching a forum in real time</v>
<v Speaker 2>on periscope,</v>

3281
02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:28.160
<v Speaker 2>it is like a new intelligence has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>created by this technology that's</v>

3282
02:29:28.161 --> 02:29:28.940
<v Speaker 2>temporal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3283
02:29:28.940 --> 02:29:33.800
<v Speaker 2>as soon as I turned it off it turns off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a large freaking mind that</v>

3284
02:29:33.860 --> 02:29:38.510
<v Speaker 2>multiplies whatever I have going on by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power of all the people watching.</v>

3285
02:29:38.511 --> 02:29:40.490
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really thrilling.</v>

3286
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:42.620
<v Speaker 2>But when it's spinning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come you have so many people that</v>

3287
02:29:42.621 --> 02:29:45.770
<v Speaker 2>are talking to you so often?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get thousands of people on there.</v>

3288
02:29:45.771 --> 02:29:47.420
<v Speaker 2>How can you pay attention to those</v>
<v Speaker 2>comments?</v>

3289
02:29:47.680 --> 02:29:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't watch them all.</v>

3290
02:29:48.681 --> 02:29:51.710
<v Speaker 2>So if someone has a good answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I usually,</v>

3291
02:29:51.711 --> 02:29:54.800
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to ask a question and then I look.</v>

3292
02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:58.280
<v Speaker 2>But otherwise if I'm talking and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>focusing on what I'm saying,</v>

3293
02:29:58.400 --> 02:30:00.110
<v Speaker 2>but when you're looking at their answer</v>
<v Speaker 2>d,</v>

3294
02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:01.670
<v Speaker 2>can you click on that answer?</v>

3295
02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Can you freeze your screen or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

3296
02:30:03.921 --> 02:30:06.500
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's like I see how it works.</v>

3297
02:30:06.700 --> 02:30:09.420
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3298
02:30:10.010 --> 02:30:12.890
<v Speaker 2>usually what happens is something go</v>
<v Speaker 2>past so quickly.</v>

3299
02:30:12.891 --> 02:30:14.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll say I missed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I missed it.</v>

3300
02:30:14.180 --> 02:30:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Say that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I look forward to it comes back.</v>

3301
02:30:16.850 --> 02:30:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why I asked,</v>

3302
02:30:17.811 --> 02:30:19.640
<v Speaker 2>because we did something similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday.</v>

3303
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:23.360
<v Speaker 2>We have this tri caster that runs a</v>
<v Speaker 2>video stream on youtube,</v>

3304
02:30:23.361 --> 02:30:27.470
<v Speaker 2>that multicolored keyboard lit up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>christmas lights looking thing.</v>

3305
02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:30.740
<v Speaker 2>That fucking thing is crashed two days</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a row on us in the middle of</v>

3306
02:30:30.770 --> 02:30:34.610
<v Speaker 2>broadcast where it never crashed before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now jamie updated all the software and</v>

3307
02:30:34.611 --> 02:30:36.890
<v Speaker 2>we're hoping it doesn't do it again in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this show has been fine,</v>

3308
02:30:37.310 --> 02:30:38.180
<v Speaker 2>but I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3309
02:30:38.240 --> 02:30:40.610
<v Speaker 2>if anybody knows a better solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please let us know.</v>

3310
02:30:40.820 --> 02:30:43.340
<v Speaker 2>And so proud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The comments were just filled on</v>

3311
02:30:43.341 --> 02:30:46.700
<v Speaker 2>instagram with all these really good</v>
<v Speaker 2>solutions and a few of them,</v>

3312
02:30:46.701 --> 02:30:48.410
<v Speaker 2>few the machines look pretty bad ass.</v>

3313
02:30:48.440 --> 02:30:49.880
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what,</v>

3314
02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:51.650
<v Speaker 2>we'll have to research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find out what's the best,</v>

3315
02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:55.460
<v Speaker 2>but that when have you ever been able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that before and you know some.</v>

3316
02:30:55.570 --> 02:30:59.780
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of dumb answers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somewhere in there is probably the</v>

3317
02:30:59.781 --> 02:31:00.950
<v Speaker 2>right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3318
02:31:00.951 --> 02:31:05.900
<v Speaker 2>in some person who's an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if somebody asked a question and it</v>

3319
02:31:05.901 --> 02:31:08.780
<v Speaker 2>was on an insert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a instagram forum or an instagram</v>

3320
02:31:08.990 --> 02:31:11.340
<v Speaker 2>picture and it had something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>being cartoonist,</v>

3321
02:31:11.680 --> 02:31:13.700
<v Speaker 2>well who better to ask than the guy who</v>
<v Speaker 2>created dilbert?</v>

3322
02:31:13.701 --> 02:31:18.620
<v Speaker 2>You would be able to answer and give</v>
<v Speaker 2>your your expert opinion on how this</v>

3323
02:31:18.621 --> 02:31:20.230
<v Speaker 2>works or that works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

3324
02:31:20.250 --> 02:31:23.040
<v Speaker 1>think also our government is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>run that way.</v>

3325
02:31:24.210 --> 02:31:28.470
<v Speaker 1>At least if trump is a transparent sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of public president like I think he will</v>

3326
02:31:28.471 --> 02:31:30.210
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's going to be a lot of</v>

3327
02:31:30.211 --> 02:31:35.211
<v Speaker 1>policies that get created in this sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of collective brain that is trump</v>

3328
02:31:35.460 --> 02:31:40.320
<v Speaker 1>leading the discussion and the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>public weighing in through social media</v>

3329
02:31:40.321 --> 02:31:45.321
<v Speaker 1>and mainstream media in every other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he can do that and probably will</v>

3330
02:31:46.050 --> 02:31:51.000
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to be like this thrilling</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of watching good thoughts</v>

3331
02:31:51.001 --> 02:31:51.860
<v Speaker 1>turn into better thoughts.</v>

3332
02:31:52.700 --> 02:31:55.640
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the rose colored glasses view of</v>

3333
02:31:55.641 --> 02:31:57.350
<v Speaker 3>the trump presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I've ever heard one,</v>

3334
02:31:57.380 --> 02:32:01.010
<v Speaker 3>that Would be the best case scenario and</v>
<v Speaker 3>also that he wants.</v>

3335
02:32:01.070 --> 02:32:03.860
<v Speaker 3>Now that he's in the office once he's no</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer in contention,</v>

3336
02:32:04.190 --> 02:32:06.470
<v Speaker 3>now he's the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now he's fighting with any way the</v>

3337
02:32:06.471 --> 02:32:09.140
<v Speaker 3>same way anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what people are worried about is</v>

3338
02:32:09.141 --> 02:32:14.141
<v Speaker 3>people that write things about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if people write poor reviews of his</v>

3339
02:32:14.511 --> 02:32:16.160
<v Speaker 3>presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're going to be attacked.</v>

3340
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:19.130
<v Speaker 3>They're worried about getting sued,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're worried about being targeted.</v>

3341
02:32:19.131 --> 02:32:23.350
<v Speaker 3>They worry about the fact that he's in</v>
<v Speaker 3>control of the nsa and he can,</v>

3342
02:32:23.370 --> 02:32:25.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could hire some edward snowden type</v>

3343
02:32:25.461 --> 02:32:28.310
<v Speaker 3>character to fuck up your life if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>write an article about them for the wall</v>

3344
02:32:28.311 --> 02:32:30.070
<v Speaker 3>street journal or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3345
02:32:30.380 --> 02:32:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3346
02:32:31.210 --> 02:32:33.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk about this as well.</v>

3347
02:32:33.130 --> 02:32:35.650
<v Speaker 1>If you look at any individually thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does like,</v>

3348
02:32:35.651 --> 02:32:38.110
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 3:00 AM and I'm tweeting about,</v>

3349
02:32:38.130 --> 02:32:40.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miss universe or something.</v>

3350
02:32:40.360 --> 02:32:43.210
<v Speaker 1>I always imagined them with the socks on</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lazy chair,</v>

3351
02:32:43.211 --> 02:32:43.601
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3352
02:32:43.601 --> 02:32:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Like a boxer shorts with a boner angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no shirt,</v>

3353
02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:53.400
<v Speaker 1>red face screaming well on is doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something with the kid and better yet</v>

3354
02:32:53.440 --> 02:32:56.980
<v Speaker 1>barefoot with yellow toenails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine he doesn't take care of his</v>

3355
02:32:56.981 --> 02:33:00.970
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3356
02:33:01.540 --> 02:33:05.440
<v Speaker 1>but what he does is he a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he praises and rewards people who are</v>

3357
02:33:05.441 --> 02:33:07.450
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good to him especially.</v>

3358
02:33:07.730 --> 02:33:10.150
<v Speaker 1>And he attacks without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without exception.</v>

3359
02:33:10.450 --> 02:33:13.740
<v Speaker 1>He just never makes an exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He will attack you if you go after him.</v>

3360
02:33:13.960 --> 02:33:17.000
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't start the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he likes to finish it.</v>

3361
02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:21.880
<v Speaker 1>I think bill burroughs one who said that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have those black socks on.</v>

3362
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I might've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might've co-opted that.</v>

3363
02:33:23.830 --> 02:33:24.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might've said,</v>

3364
02:33:24.980 --> 02:33:26.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're drunk durinG the end of the world</v>

3365
02:33:26.321 --> 02:33:31.290
<v Speaker 1>podcast if you haven't heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get a podcast while the presidency</v>

3366
02:33:31.300 --> 02:33:33.910
<v Speaker 1>was being called and bill burr was on</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

3367
02:33:34.330 --> 02:33:37.150
<v Speaker 1>It was on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the funniest podcast ever,</v>

3368
02:33:37.480 --> 02:33:39.370
<v Speaker 1>but It was all like watching it all go</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

3369
02:33:39.630 --> 02:33:42.220
<v Speaker 1>At one time he got into an argument with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other comedians,</v>

3370
02:33:42.221 --> 02:33:45.920
<v Speaker 1>sarah tiana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because tiana was talking about how uh,</v>

3371
02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.840
<v Speaker 1>anybody who supports trump is a racist</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sexist and then.</v>

3372
02:33:49.330 --> 02:33:52.330
<v Speaker 1>And then bill made fun of it and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

3373
02:33:52.930 --> 02:33:55.420
<v Speaker 1>it was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the perfect thing to see why it</v>

3374
02:33:55.421 --> 02:33:58.360
<v Speaker 1>was all going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like you were seeing in bill and</v>

3375
02:33:58.361 --> 02:34:00.580
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing it in a physical form the</v>

3376
02:34:00.581 --> 02:34:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Way people are choosing to frame this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3377
02:34:03.670 --> 02:34:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch that.</v>

3378
02:34:06.520 --> 02:34:07.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

3379
02:34:07.361 --> 02:34:10.900
<v Speaker 1>I was just saying trump likes to leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest gap between pleasing him,</v>

3380
02:34:10.930 --> 02:34:14.140
<v Speaker 1>end up pleasing him and it has nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with the thing he's fighting about</v>

3381
02:34:14.141 --> 02:34:16.660
<v Speaker 1>it at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about setting it up so that the</v>

3382
02:34:16.661 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 1>next who's thinking should</v>

3383
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:21.460
<v Speaker 3>I fuck with him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That didn't work for the last 700</v>

3384
02:34:21.461 --> 02:34:26.461
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if it had worked for some people to</v>

3385
02:34:26.501 --> 02:34:28.860
<v Speaker 3>fuck with him in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would be tempted.</v>

3386
02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:29.471
<v Speaker 3>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3387
02:34:29.471 --> 02:34:32.080
<v Speaker 3>sometimes people get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a different thing though.</v>

3388
02:34:32.081 --> 02:34:35.170
<v Speaker 3>Once you're the president versus once</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just some billionaire</v>

3389
02:34:36.970 --> 02:34:38.440
<v Speaker 3>real estate tycoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there was.</v>

3390
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:43.710
<v Speaker 3>There was one guy that was writing about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it where he had been sued by trump and</v>

3391
02:34:43.900 --> 02:34:46.540
<v Speaker 3>when.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he wrote an article and when</v>

3392
02:34:46.541 --> 02:34:51.541
<v Speaker 3>they started examining the actual data</v>
<v Speaker 3>it got pretty ugly pretty quick and then</v>

3393
02:34:51.911 --> 02:34:56.911
<v Speaker 3>they abandoned the lawsuit and this guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump wound up getting him a seat for</v>

3394
02:34:58.031 --> 02:35:01.690
<v Speaker 3>the fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he got him a ticket and I think he</v>

3395
02:35:01.691 --> 02:35:06.430
<v Speaker 3>flew him out to atlantic city and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone with them as well for the fights</v>

3396
02:35:06.431 --> 02:35:07.510
<v Speaker 3>and that became like an issue.</v>

3397
02:35:08.010 --> 02:35:09.010
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3398
02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:11.200
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does that connect with the.</v>

3399
02:35:11.220 --> 02:35:13.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm missing the string there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3400
02:35:13.001 --> 02:35:15.430
<v Speaker 3>just you know that he's just a master</v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulator.</v>

3401
02:35:15.850 --> 02:35:20.260
<v Speaker 3>Like in the middle of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has this lawsuit thing with this guy,</v>

3402
02:35:20.350 --> 02:35:23.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the guy calls him a shithead or</v>

3403
02:35:23.051 --> 02:35:25.150
<v Speaker 3>whatever you called them and writes this</v>
<v Speaker 3>article about him.</v>

3404
02:35:25.450 --> 02:35:30.450
<v Speaker 3>Trump get some tickets to some fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Susan loses in court or loses the,</v>

3405
02:35:30.881 --> 02:35:32.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're going through all the data,</v>

3406
02:35:32.531 --> 02:35:35.200
<v Speaker 3>they abandoned the lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump gets of tickets to the fight with</v>

3407
02:35:35.201 --> 02:35:39.250
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably all part of rewarding</v>

3408
02:35:39.251 --> 02:35:41.410
<v Speaker 3>people and punishing people so that you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3409
02:35:41.430 --> 02:35:45.200
<v Speaker 3>you feel there's a state game of thrones</v>
<v Speaker 3>type shit that came with us.</v>

3410
02:35:45.790 --> 02:35:48.070
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't look like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just thinking of that in the</v>

3411
02:35:48.190 --> 02:35:51.010
<v Speaker 3>weirdly as I was doing something the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other day,</v>

3412
02:35:51.490 --> 02:35:56.410
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking that you could map all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these family dynasties unto the game of</v>

3413
02:35:56.411 --> 02:35:57.720
<v Speaker 3>thrones thing.</v>

3414
02:35:58.030 --> 02:36:01.960
<v Speaker 3>You could in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is bizarre in to the extreme</v>

3415
02:36:02.170 --> 02:36:06.400
<v Speaker 3>that we've dealt with these family</v>
<v Speaker 3>dynasties like the bush family in.</v>

3416
02:36:06.430 --> 02:36:08.560
<v Speaker 3>We almost did it again with jeb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3417
02:36:08.561 --> 02:36:10.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows if it wasn't for trump,</v>

3418
02:36:10.271 --> 02:36:14.680
<v Speaker 3>if trump wasn't around and he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with that low energy jeb things</v>

3419
02:36:14.681 --> 02:36:15.300
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you called them?</v>

3420
02:36:15.300 --> 02:36:16.133
<v Speaker 3>YeAh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low energy.</v>

3421
02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:19.630
<v Speaker 3>If he didn't see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also jeff just sucked.</v>

3422
02:36:19.900 --> 02:36:21.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the pressure was on,</v>

3423
02:36:21.491 --> 02:36:23.830
<v Speaker 3>he just wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This wasn't good.</v>

3424
02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:26.020
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when all that stuff was going down</v>

3425
02:36:26.021 --> 02:36:28.470
<v Speaker 3>or like rick perry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when remembering rick perry's in</v>

3426
02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:29.620
<v Speaker 3>debates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just didn't know what the fuck he</v>

3427
02:36:29.621 --> 02:36:30.460
<v Speaker 3>was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3428
02:36:30.910 --> 02:36:33.730
<v Speaker 3>what was I even saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's it,</v>

3429
02:36:33.940 --> 02:36:38.620
<v Speaker 3>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it wasn't for that happening with</v>

3430
02:36:38.621 --> 02:36:41.230
<v Speaker 3>jeb bush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might have very well gotten the same</v>

3431
02:36:41.231 --> 02:36:43.710
<v Speaker 3>position that donald got into.</v>

3432
02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:45.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you looked at all the other people,</v>

3433
02:36:45.161 --> 02:36:48.400
<v Speaker 3>he least had that familiar name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People might've been inclined.</v>

3434
02:36:48.401 --> 02:36:53.401
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have any real crazy like</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible stories in the past that got</v>

3435
02:36:55.091 --> 02:36:57.610
<v Speaker 3>brought up immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could very well and they would have</v>

3436
02:36:57.611 --> 02:37:00.780
<v Speaker 3>continued that family dynasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The clinton family dynasties another</v>

3437
02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:02.100
<v Speaker 3>disturbing one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3438
02:37:02.110 --> 02:37:04.060
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird dynasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3439
02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:08.140
<v Speaker 3>is a chelsea next is Michelle Obama</v>
<v Speaker 3>next.</v>

3440
02:37:08.230 --> 02:37:09.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she's definitely.</v>

3441
02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:10.930
<v Speaker 3>That's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3442
02:37:11.140 --> 02:37:13.180
<v Speaker 3>That's the big question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would be excellent.</v>

3443
02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:17.660
<v Speaker 3>She would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like a reallY good speaker.</v>

3444
02:37:17.661 --> 02:37:21.200
<v Speaker 3>She's very intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's very articulate.</v>

3445
02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:25.430
<v Speaker 3>she's a very measured and composed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stately and</v>

3446
02:37:25.610 --> 02:37:27.910
<v Speaker 1>as mcgregor said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fight,</v>

3447
02:37:28.060 --> 02:37:30.830
<v Speaker 1>She has lots of attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has a lot of attributes.</v>

3448
02:37:30.831 --> 02:37:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3449
02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:32.041
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3450
02:37:32.041 --> 02:37:37.041
<v Speaker 3>and she carrIed herself extremely well</v>
<v Speaker 3>for eight years in the white house under</v>

3451
02:37:37.291 --> 02:37:38.670
<v Speaker 3>some incredible pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3452
02:37:38.671 --> 02:37:40.490
<v Speaker 3>I dunno what she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what her,</v>

3453
02:37:40.840 --> 02:37:43.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her responsibilities were what our days</v>

3454
02:37:43.231 --> 02:37:46.110
<v Speaker 3>looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's never made a misstep.</v>

3455
02:37:46.230 --> 02:37:48.540
<v Speaker 3>There was never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never been an embarrassing interview.</v>

3456
02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:49.553
<v Speaker 3>Never important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3457
02:37:49.570 --> 02:37:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Nothing much less controversial than</v>
<v Speaker 3>hillary clinton.</v>

3458
02:37:54.090 --> 02:37:55.770
<v Speaker 3>Much less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3459
02:37:55.771 --> 02:37:58.260
<v Speaker 3>because even before the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3460
02:37:58.380 --> 02:38:01.290
<v Speaker 3>like she tried to run for president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was always the whitewater thing</v>

3461
02:38:01.291 --> 02:38:04.380
<v Speaker 3>that she was connected through the vince</v>
<v Speaker 3>foster thing that she was connected to.</v>

3462
02:38:04.620 --> 02:38:06.060
<v Speaker 3>HAve you seen that meme?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3463
02:38:06.061 --> 02:38:09.930
<v Speaker 3>they're doing all these joe biden memes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the recent joe biden meme</v>

3464
02:38:10.530 --> 02:38:13.620
<v Speaker 3>the one with and see if you could find</v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

3465
02:38:13.830 --> 02:38:16.050
<v Speaker 3>I think I retweeted it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I retweeted it yesterday.</v>

3466
02:38:16.140 --> 02:38:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Somebody tweeted it it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3467
02:38:18.330 --> 02:38:19.163
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3468
02:38:19.740 --> 02:38:23.320
<v Speaker 3>joe biden and obama laughing about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3469
02:38:24.270 --> 02:38:27.990
<v Speaker 3>about hillary having something in common</v>
<v Speaker 3>with monica lewinsky now.</v>

3470
02:38:28.620 --> 02:38:31.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pull it up so you can say you could see</v>

3471
02:38:31.201 --> 02:38:31.920
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to blow it.</v>

3472
02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:33.660
<v Speaker 3>Check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

3473
02:38:33.900 --> 02:38:36.330
<v Speaker 3>Look joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it says joe.</v>

3474
02:38:36.331 --> 02:38:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hillary.</v>

3475
02:38:37.830 --> 02:38:40.250
<v Speaker 3>Now you and monica have something else</v>
<v Speaker 3>in common.</v>

3476
02:38:40.290 --> 02:38:43.050
<v Speaker 3>You blew it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then obama and he's laughing.</v>

3477
02:38:43.051 --> 02:38:46.110
<v Speaker 3>Throws his head back laughing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>obama's look at that and look with his</v>

3478
02:38:46.111 --> 02:38:47.800
<v Speaker 3>eyebrows raised and it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3479
02:38:47.820 --> 02:38:48.810
<v Speaker 3>she kills people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3480
02:38:53.010 --> 02:38:56.490
<v Speaker 3>These are fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think she's killed anybody?</v>

3481
02:38:58.470 --> 02:39:03.360
<v Speaker 3>That kid that got shot outside of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>apartment at 4:00 in the morning or they</v>

3482
02:39:03.361 --> 02:39:05.790
<v Speaker 3>didn't take his cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't take his wallet.</v>

3483
02:39:05.791 --> 02:39:09.750
<v Speaker 3>They didn't take his money and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>according to wikileaks,</v>

3484
02:39:09.751 --> 02:39:13.470
<v Speaker 3>was the one that leaked all those</v>
<v Speaker 3>documents about the dnc and the dnc</v>

3485
02:39:13.471 --> 02:39:15.930
<v Speaker 3>favoring hillary clinton over bernie</v>
<v Speaker 3>sanders.</v>

3486
02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:19.320
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what else that guy knew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that was the guy,</v>

3487
02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:20.550
<v Speaker 3>if that is the case,</v>

3488
02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:25.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seem more likely that even if</v>

3489
02:39:25.871 --> 02:39:29.020
<v Speaker 1>they were murderers because of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>hillary clinton,</v>

3490
02:39:29.021 --> 02:39:31.240
<v Speaker 1>the connection that she wouldn't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

3491
02:39:31.450 --> 02:39:33.130
<v Speaker 1>perhaps just somebody who thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3492
02:39:33.131 --> 02:39:37.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to change history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do a favor perhaps perhaps,</v>

3493
02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:41.770
<v Speaker 1>but this is also the woman who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>attributed in an email.</v>

3494
02:39:41.771 --> 02:39:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not it's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said about julian assan,</v>

3495
02:39:46.540 --> 02:39:49.960
<v Speaker 1>can't we just drone that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy is some thumbing his nose that</v>

3496
02:39:49.961 --> 02:39:53.680
<v Speaker 1>America can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just drone him so I don't want to</v>

3497
02:39:53.681 --> 02:39:56.620
<v Speaker 1>drone him because I think he's done a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great service.</v>

3498
02:39:57.130 --> 02:39:59.800
<v Speaker 1>But from the butts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>

3499
02:40:00.340 --> 02:40:04.990
<v Speaker 1>from the context of a government looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this situation,</v>

3500
02:40:05.170 --> 02:40:08.170
<v Speaker 1>if government secrets have been stolen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and It's your job to,</v>

3501
02:40:08.340 --> 02:40:10.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure this doesn't happen and you</v>

3502
02:40:10.411 --> 02:40:11.590
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get justice.</v>

3503
02:40:11.950 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 1>That's actually kind a fair question.</v>

3504
02:40:14.290 --> 02:40:16.500
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want because you're saying</v>

3505
02:40:16.501 --> 02:40:18.300
<v Speaker 3>what are all our options?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3506
02:40:18.301 --> 02:40:20.880
<v Speaker 3>it could be off the cuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flippant statement that she didn't</v>

3507
02:40:20.881 --> 02:40:22.650
<v Speaker 3>really take serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like can we just drone him?</v>

3508
02:40:23.370 --> 02:40:25.980
<v Speaker 3>But she said some creepy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the things that she said</v>

3509
02:40:25.981 --> 02:40:28.980
<v Speaker 3>about gadhafi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ever see that interview where she's</v>

3510
02:40:28.981 --> 02:40:29.850
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

3511
02:40:29.851 --> 02:40:31.800
<v Speaker 3>we came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we saw he died.</v>

3512
02:40:31.801 --> 02:40:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Ha ha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ha ha.</v>

3513
02:40:33.810 --> 02:40:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a startling and shocking is</v>

3514
02:40:37.351 --> 02:40:39.690
<v Speaker 3>after she hit her head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

3515
02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would explain.</v>

3516
02:40:42.181 --> 02:40:43.740
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3517
02:40:44.130 --> 02:40:48.300
<v Speaker 3>very irrational to think that way and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very impulsive to to say that out</v>

3518
02:40:48.301 --> 02:40:52.710
<v Speaker 3>loud because you're dealing with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dissolving of a nation.</v>

3519
02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Libya is in complete total turmoil and</v>
<v Speaker 3>has become a breeding ground for isis</v>

3520
02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:03.180
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of that can be attributed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>it being completely destabilized by the</v>

3521
02:41:03.181 --> 02:41:06.600
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>helping out all the people that wound up</v>

3522
02:41:06.601 --> 02:41:07.440
<v Speaker 3>killing gaddafi.</v>

3523
02:41:07.610 --> 02:41:10.200
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Naafi wasn't a huge piece of shit and</v>

3524
02:41:10.201 --> 02:41:12.690
<v Speaker 3>the world is in better because he's dead</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably is,</v>

3525
02:41:12.691 --> 02:41:16.830
<v Speaker 3>but Libya is not better right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like olivia became completely unstable</v>

3526
02:41:16.831 --> 02:41:20.160
<v Speaker 3>after that so that he came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we came,</v>

3527
02:41:20.490 --> 02:41:22.420
<v Speaker 3>we saw he died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ha ha,</v>

3528
02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:25.410
<v Speaker 3>ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like laughing in the face of</v>

3529
02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:29.400
<v Speaker 3>these poor unfortunate people who just</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a shit,</v>

3530
02:41:29.401 --> 02:41:33.580
<v Speaker 3>roll the dice and grew up in Libya and</v>
<v Speaker 3>now they're stuck there and then the</v>

3531
02:41:33.610 --> 02:41:38.280
<v Speaker 3>right side of the character from how</v>
<v Speaker 3>skilled the politician she is to say</v>

3532
02:41:38.281 --> 02:41:40.820
<v Speaker 3>something that's so clearly the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to say at throwing.</v>

3533
02:41:41.100 --> 02:41:42.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wHen was the fall of Libya?</v>

3534
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Was that 13 or 14?</v>

3535
02:41:46.710 --> 02:41:49.710
<v Speaker 3>When did a find out when gaddafi died?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When gaddafi was killed?</v>

3536
02:41:49.740 --> 02:41:50.940
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget it.</v>

3537
02:41:50.941 --> 02:41:53.670
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you that that video is fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrifying.</v>

3538
02:41:54.060 --> 02:41:56.830
<v Speaker 3>The video of the rebels capturing him</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're sticking things up.</v>

3539
02:41:56.831 --> 02:41:58.650
<v Speaker 3>His assets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two thousand 11,</v>

3540
02:42:00.090 --> 02:42:05.090
<v Speaker 3>I believe the interview with her was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>2012 or 13.</v>

3541
02:42:05.671 --> 02:42:09.330
<v Speaker 3>See if you could find that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's in 2012 or 13,</v>

3542
02:42:09.331 --> 02:42:14.331
<v Speaker 3>it's entirely possible that this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>directly post concussion and a severe</v>

3543
02:42:15.780 --> 02:42:17.520
<v Speaker 3>bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently on her brain,</v>

3544
02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:20.940
<v Speaker 3>she had some serious problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's fucked up for like 12 months.</v>

3545
02:42:20.941 --> 02:42:24.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people realize that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>can permanently change your personality</v>

3546
02:42:25.050 --> 02:42:27.900
<v Speaker 3>permanently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The the average person doesn't thInk</v>

3547
02:42:27.901 --> 02:42:30.270
<v Speaker 3>that's a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen it.</v>

3548
02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:31.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have as well,</v>

3549
02:42:31.710 --> 02:42:32.521
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

3550
02:42:32.521 --> 02:42:36.330
<v Speaker 3>many times because I'm in the head</v>
<v Speaker 3>trauma business in a lot of ways because</v>

3551
02:42:36.331 --> 02:42:38.700
<v Speaker 3>of my experience with the ufc.</v>

3552
02:42:39.170 --> 02:42:41.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know people that have been hitting</v>

3553
02:42:41.110 --> 02:42:43.290
<v Speaker 3>the head outside of the ufc and have</v>
<v Speaker 3>never been the same.</v>

3554
02:42:43.660 --> 02:42:46.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is one of the things that I've</v>

3555
02:42:46.621 --> 02:42:50.010
<v Speaker 3>always said about sam kinison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam kennison had a great book written</v>

3556
02:42:50.011 --> 02:42:53.790
<v Speaker 3>about him by his brother called my</v>
<v Speaker 3>brother sam or brother sam.</v>

3557
02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:55.620
<v Speaker 3>It's a great book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially for me,</v>

3558
02:42:55.710 --> 02:42:59.430
<v Speaker 3>huge kennison fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he basically says sam was one person</v>

3559
02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:03.570
<v Speaker 3>and then he got hit by a truck when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a little kid and became a completely</v>

3560
02:43:03.571 --> 02:43:06.930
<v Speaker 3>different person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Became reckless and wild and it came out</v>

3561
02:43:06.931 --> 02:43:08.580
<v Speaker 3>of a head injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3562
02:43:08.581 --> 02:43:11.650
<v Speaker 3>The lack of control didn't give a fuck.</v>

3563
02:43:12.940 --> 02:43:14.410
<v Speaker 2>That's where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3564
02:43:14.470 --> 02:43:16.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally from brain trauma.</v>

3565
02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:18.273
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

3566
02:43:18.450 --> 02:43:20.050
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This video that's got a million and a</v>

3567
02:43:20.051 --> 02:43:22.510
<v Speaker 4>half to 2011 was uploaded the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

3568
02:43:22.511 --> 02:43:23.920
<v Speaker 4>It says he died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3569
02:43:24.040 --> 02:43:24.940
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Possible.</v>

3570
02:43:25.150 --> 02:43:27.950
<v Speaker 4>That she already interviewed and was</v>
<v Speaker 4>recorded and put.</v>

3571
02:43:28.030 --> 02:43:29.680
<v Speaker 4>This was up on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean It may be possible.</v>

3572
02:43:29.681 --> 02:43:33.610
<v Speaker 4>It happened like that morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't seem right.</v>

3573
02:43:34.710 --> 02:43:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're saying that this</v>

3574
02:43:36.950 --> 02:43:39.050
<v Speaker 2>same day as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's why she's giddy,</v>

3575
02:43:39.051 --> 02:43:43.430
<v Speaker 2>but if that is the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why don't you find out because this</v>

3576
02:43:43.431 --> 02:43:45.500
<v Speaker 2>is just one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says 1 million,</v>

3577
02:43:45.501 --> 02:43:50.000
<v Speaker 2>542,000 cbs news interview with hillary</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinton.</v>

3578
02:43:50.060 --> 02:43:52.100
<v Speaker 2>There it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laughed about killing gaddafi.</v>

3579
02:43:52.130 --> 02:43:56.000
<v Speaker 2>Go to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for 2016 and let's see when it</v>

3580
02:43:56.001 --> 02:44:01.001
<v Speaker 2>says it says flash back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was like right after and she</v>

3581
02:44:01.131 --> 02:44:02.720
<v Speaker 2>was so giddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if that's the case,</v>

3582
02:44:03.140 --> 02:44:05.480
<v Speaker 2>the link to that video I just pulled up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3583
02:44:05.870 --> 02:44:08.870
<v Speaker 2>so if that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what does it say in that article and</v>

3584
02:44:08.871 --> 02:44:10.670
<v Speaker 2>that article that you're reading before</v>
<v Speaker 2>you click on it,</v>

3585
02:44:10.671 --> 02:44:12.510
<v Speaker 2>see flashlIght right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You like,</v>

3586
02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:17.540
<v Speaker 2>what does it say there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he died in 2011 and she supposedly</v>

3587
02:44:17.541 --> 02:44:22.541
<v Speaker 2>had the big head injury in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't even blame It on that.</v>

3588
02:44:22.641 --> 02:44:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Then I'll look into it.</v>

3589
02:44:25.190 --> 02:44:27.260
<v Speaker 2>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't really blame it on that</v>

3590
02:44:27.261 --> 02:44:29.540
<v Speaker 2>because that means that she hit her head</v>
<v Speaker 2>after this.</v>

3591
02:44:30.020 --> 02:44:32.600
<v Speaker 2>She's laughing probably about gaddafi</v>
<v Speaker 2>died and she fell.</v>

3592
02:44:33.590 --> 02:44:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Maybe when you laugh really hard and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not that healthy,</v>

3593
02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:41.080
<v Speaker 2>she was drinking or or do you think she</v>
<v Speaker 2>loses it up but were saying Scott Adams?</v>

3594
02:44:41.310 --> 02:44:42.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't rule that out.</v>

3595
02:44:43.310 --> 02:44:44.900
<v Speaker 2>Definitely can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't look too healthy.</v>

3596
02:44:45.800 --> 02:44:47.330
<v Speaker 2>She's definitely not eating the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>foods.</v>

3597
02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:49.490
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was saying that no matter how much she</v>

3598
02:44:49.491 --> 02:44:53.010
<v Speaker 2>drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she is a social drinker and you know,</v>

3599
02:44:53.090 --> 02:44:55.730
<v Speaker 2>people were just social drinkers who</v>
<v Speaker 2>have had two drinks,</v>

3600
02:44:55.731 --> 02:44:58.370
<v Speaker 2>let's say you don't want them driving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3601
02:44:59.300 --> 02:45:02.960
<v Speaker 2>So why isn't that disqualifying for</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who's going to be in control of</v>

3602
02:45:02.961 --> 02:45:04.910
<v Speaker 2>the nuclear arsenal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who admits?</v>

3603
02:45:04.911 --> 02:45:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a social drinker now.</v>

3604
02:45:06.741 --> 02:45:10.190
<v Speaker 2>In the past you never had to ask that</v>
<v Speaker 2>question because it was too social</v>

3605
02:45:10.191 --> 02:45:13.280
<v Speaker 2>drinkers running against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to get a social drinker</v>

3606
02:45:13.310 --> 02:45:16.280
<v Speaker 2>no matter who got elected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But trump's the first time you had a non</v>

3607
02:45:16.281 --> 02:45:17.750
<v Speaker 2>drinker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't drink at all.</v>

3608
02:45:17.810 --> 02:45:18.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3609
02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:21.110
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't had a sip of alcohol in his</v>

3610
02:45:21.111 --> 02:45:22.850
<v Speaker 2>life really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a drug.</v>

3611
02:45:22.851 --> 02:45:25.340
<v Speaker 2>He claims I'd like to get them drunk and</v>
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>

3612
02:45:25.460 --> 02:45:26.293
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

3613
02:45:26.650 --> 02:45:31.030
<v Speaker 4>This issue was being interviewed in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Afghanistan on that day and news hit so</v>

3614
02:45:31.031 --> 02:45:33.870
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess that video was not being taped</v>

3615
02:45:34.010 --> 02:45:37.760
<v Speaker 4>or it wasn't a supposed to be taped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was like an unfair kind of</v>

3616
02:45:37.950 --> 02:45:38.440
<v Speaker 4>record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3617
02:45:38.440 --> 02:45:39.670
<v Speaker 4>it was definitely an unfair recording,</v>

3618
02:45:40.070 --> 02:45:43.550
<v Speaker 2>but so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was like right when it happened,</v>

3619
02:45:43.780 --> 02:45:45.860
<v Speaker 2>but she was laughing about it right when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happened,</v>

3620
02:45:45.890 --> 02:45:48.850
<v Speaker 2>but that explains why she was out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>character for her normal.</v>

3621
02:45:48.870 --> 02:45:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That does make sense.</v>

3622
02:45:50.211 --> 02:45:52.490
<v Speaker 2>She was giddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was off camera that they just killed</v>

3623
02:45:52.491 --> 02:45:54.440
<v Speaker 2>this guy and she was off camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3624
02:45:55.340 --> 02:45:57.830
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot more logical.</v>

3625
02:45:57.860 --> 02:46:00.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that we solve this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We solved it.</v>

3626
02:46:00.170 --> 02:46:02.870
<v Speaker 2>We should be detective Scott Adams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3627
02:46:03.410 --> 02:46:07.250
<v Speaker 2>we solved a lot of things today I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we cleared up a lot of people's</v>

3628
02:46:07.251 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 2>misconceptions about you that not only</v>
<v Speaker 2>did not vote for trump,</v>

3629
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:13.820
<v Speaker 3>you don't vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were essentially just looking at</v>

3630
02:46:13.821 --> 02:46:17.360
<v Speaker 3>this thing as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person who knows a lot about</v>

3631
02:46:17.361 --> 02:46:21.650
<v Speaker 3>persuasion and knows a lot about public</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking and what you were looking at</v>

3632
02:46:21.651 --> 02:46:22.940
<v Speaker 3>this and you were going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

3633
02:46:22.941 --> 02:46:25.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're almost like watching a game.</v>

3634
02:46:25.170 --> 02:46:26.960
<v Speaker 3>You're watching a game play out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you say,</v>

3635
02:46:26.961 --> 02:46:28.760
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the raiders are going to slaughter the</v>

3636
02:46:28.761 --> 02:46:30.870
<v Speaker 3>dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean you hate the dolphins,</v>

3637
02:46:30.930 --> 02:46:34.220
<v Speaker 3>means you're looking at the actual law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that defensive line,</v>

3638
02:46:34.221 --> 02:46:35.390
<v Speaker 3>the offense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the quarterback.</v>

3639
02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:37.190
<v Speaker 3>I see where this game is going to go.</v>

3640
02:46:37.330 --> 02:46:41.230
<v Speaker 1>I thought when this whole thing started</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing the trump candidacy,</v>

3641
02:46:41.710 --> 02:46:45.970
<v Speaker 1>that would open a crack in the universe</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I could talk about this persuasion</v>

3642
02:46:45.971 --> 02:46:49.120
<v Speaker 1>stuff and be believed and in order to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed,</v>

3643
02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:54.600
<v Speaker 1>my technique for that was last year I</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicted so that when the day came,</v>

3644
02:46:54.791 --> 02:46:57.610
<v Speaker 1>when I was right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have enough credibility to say,</v>

3645
02:46:57.611 --> 02:46:59.050
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the other things I said,</v>

3646
02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:00.580
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should pay attention to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

3647
02:47:01.270 --> 02:47:04.240
<v Speaker 1>So it was sort of a long game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was playing for credibility.</v>

3648
02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:07.690
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that persuasion would be the</v>

3649
02:47:07.691 --> 02:47:08.710
<v Speaker 1>most important variable.</v>

3650
02:47:09.490 --> 02:47:11.540
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly a huge variable in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

3651
02:47:11.830 --> 02:47:14.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as is what we discussed earlier,</v>

3652
02:47:14.241 --> 02:47:17.150
<v Speaker 3>the ability to speak publicly with</v>
<v Speaker 3>confidence,</v>

3653
02:47:17.570 --> 02:47:20.720
<v Speaker 3>not just persuasion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just to not look rattled.</v>

3654
02:47:21.020 --> 02:47:23.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you're not persuaded like you</v>

3655
02:47:23.551 --> 02:47:26.420
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not getting defeated even when he's</v>

3656
02:47:26.421 --> 02:47:29.060
<v Speaker 3>losing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would see like these debates and I</v>

3657
02:47:29.061 --> 02:47:29.481
<v Speaker 3>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3658
02:47:29.481 --> 02:47:32.470
<v Speaker 3>she made some salient points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She seemed more articulate.</v>

3659
02:47:32.471 --> 02:47:34.850
<v Speaker 3>she seemed smoother with her words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She seemed more stately,</v>

3660
02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:38.840
<v Speaker 3>but he never felt like he lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't act like he lost.</v>

3661
02:47:39.170 --> 02:47:39.820
<v Speaker 3>That's giant</v>

3662
02:47:39.820 --> 02:47:40.690
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3663
02:47:40.730 --> 02:47:42.230
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are,</v>

3664
02:47:42.250 --> 02:47:44.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pick up their feelings for other</v>

3665
02:47:44.061 --> 02:47:45.440
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just look at them and say,</v>

3666
02:47:45.441 --> 02:47:46.274
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's happy.</v>

3667
02:47:46.310 --> 02:47:48.530
<v Speaker 1>So happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just picking that up.</v>

3668
02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:51.950
<v Speaker 1>People walk in the room and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>downers and your energy goes down as</v>

3669
02:47:51.951 --> 02:47:52.784
<v Speaker 1>soon as they enter.</v>

3670
02:47:53.100 --> 02:47:57.420
<v Speaker 3>Watching someone super uncomfortable or</v>
<v Speaker 3>unsuccessful is very.</v>

3671
02:47:57.421 --> 02:48:00.200
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to do like watching someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>bomb on stage.</v>

3672
02:48:00.600 --> 02:48:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Very hard</v>

3673
02:48:01.180 --> 02:48:02.100
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3674
02:48:02.550 --> 02:48:06.030
<v Speaker 1>one of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my great moments when I started</v>

3675
02:48:06.031 --> 02:48:10.710
<v Speaker 1>to understand the world better is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time I smoked pot in college.</v>

3676
02:48:10.890 --> 02:48:14.930
<v Speaker 1>And for most of my college experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found,</v>

3677
02:48:15.060 --> 02:48:20.060
<v Speaker 1>I found this weird pattern that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were nicer to me if I had just gotten</v>

3678
02:48:20.281 --> 02:48:25.281
<v Speaker 1>high and it was years before I realized</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was causing them to be nice</v>

3679
02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:28.470
<v Speaker 1>because you were nicer to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just relaxed and you were given a</v>

3680
02:48:28.471 --> 02:48:29.900
<v Speaker 1>better vibe out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gave anthony died.</v>

3681
02:48:30.300 --> 02:48:34.590
<v Speaker 1>And I realized that I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can control how they act simply by my</v>

3682
02:48:34.591 --> 02:48:35.424
<v Speaker 1>emotional state.</v>

3683
02:48:35.790 --> 02:48:39.360
<v Speaker 3>Well definitely we control how people</v>
<v Speaker 3>react to us based on what kind of.</v>

3684
02:48:39.430 --> 02:48:42.450
<v Speaker 3>And I've given off the wrong energy</v>
<v Speaker 3>before and you see it in people,</v>

3685
02:48:42.451 --> 02:48:42.691
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3686
02:48:42.691 --> 02:48:43.950
<v Speaker 3>ah fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3687
02:48:43.951 --> 02:48:46.680
<v Speaker 3>like maybe you're too caught up in what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing and you don't want to be</v>

3688
02:48:46.681 --> 02:48:50.040
<v Speaker 3>bothered or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've all been there before.</v>

3689
02:48:50.041 --> 02:48:52.470
<v Speaker 3>And then we've all been on the opposite</v>
<v Speaker 3>where maybe someone's like,</v>

3690
02:48:52.471 --> 02:48:53.490
<v Speaker 3>this guy's a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3691
02:48:53.491 --> 02:48:55.290
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just had a wonderful,</v>

3692
02:48:55.291 --> 02:48:59.460
<v Speaker 3>pleasant conversation with him because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you interface with them in the perfect</v>

3693
02:48:59.461 --> 02:49:01.860
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the right time with respect.</v>

3694
02:49:02.130 --> 02:49:05.700
<v Speaker 3>And the guy lord his guard and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and gave a little back to you and you</v>

3695
02:49:05.701 --> 02:49:07.550
<v Speaker 3>gave more to him and everybody's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

3696
02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:09.900
<v Speaker 3>I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we've all experienced both of</v>

3697
02:49:09.901 --> 02:49:14.370
<v Speaker 3>those things and I think that's one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problems with one person accounts of</v>

3698
02:49:14.371 --> 02:49:15.990
<v Speaker 3>any bad thing that went on.</v>

3699
02:49:15.990 --> 02:49:17.910
<v Speaker 3>Like can I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've looked at some of this trump</v>

3700
02:49:17.911 --> 02:49:18.960
<v Speaker 3>stuff and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3701
02:49:18.961 --> 02:49:20.430
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What really did happen?</v>

3702
02:49:20.431 --> 02:49:23.040
<v Speaker 3>What really did happen with the clinton</v>
<v Speaker 3>accusations?</v>

3703
02:49:23.041 --> 02:49:25.860
<v Speaker 3>What was really going down between these</v>
<v Speaker 3>two people because one of them is</v>

3704
02:49:25.861 --> 02:49:27.990
<v Speaker 3>talking about and the other one isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we don't know what the fuck the</v>

3705
02:49:27.991 --> 02:49:31.020
<v Speaker 3>answer is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's often the case.</v>

3706
02:49:31.050 --> 02:49:33.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like the actual reaction that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have.</v>

3707
02:49:34.020 --> 02:49:37.020
<v Speaker 3>They want to think that the other person</v>
<v Speaker 3>was being a dick,</v>

3708
02:49:37.260 --> 02:49:41.160
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you were being something</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative too,</v>

3709
02:49:41.161 --> 02:49:43.350
<v Speaker 3>and they're reacted to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it compounded.</v>

3710
02:49:43.351 --> 02:49:47.490
<v Speaker 3>But maybe as Scott Adams was talking to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy and use the exact same words,</v>

3711
02:49:47.760 --> 02:49:50.310
<v Speaker 3>none of the disagreement would have</v>
<v Speaker 3>taken place in the first place.</v>

3712
02:49:50.570 --> 02:49:52.160
<v Speaker 3>The messenger is always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3713
02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:53.340
<v Speaker 3>the message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3714
02:49:53.341 --> 02:49:54.660
<v Speaker 3>we're both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

3715
02:49:54.690 --> 02:49:59.010
<v Speaker 3>we are more than one thing and when</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings are interacting with each</v>

3716
02:49:59.011 --> 02:50:00.180
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

3717
02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:03.360
<v Speaker 3>we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like we're putting on a</v>

3718
02:50:03.361 --> 02:50:04.860
<v Speaker 3>combined effort.</v>

3719
02:50:05.100 --> 02:50:05.911
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're,</v>

3720
02:50:05.911 --> 02:50:10.740
<v Speaker 3>we're piecing together a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this conversation is a joint effort.</v>

3721
02:50:10.920 --> 02:50:14.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're both contributing to it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it might come out terrible.</v>

3722
02:50:15.170 --> 02:50:16.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it might not be your fault.</v>

3723
02:50:16.531 --> 02:50:19.200
<v Speaker 3>It might be 100 percent my fault or it</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be 100 percent your fault.</v>

3724
02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:21.930
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way it comes out is because the</v>

3725
02:50:21.931 --> 02:50:24.290
<v Speaker 3>two of us together didn't sync up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3726
02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:26.820
<v Speaker 3>and oftentimes they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met Scott Adams.</v>

3727
02:50:26.821 --> 02:50:29.490
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking piece of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not really you.</v>

3728
02:50:29.491 --> 02:50:31.530
<v Speaker 3>It might just be the way I hear that a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>

3729
02:50:31.580 --> 02:50:34.870
<v Speaker 3>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it might be the way this person talk</v>

3730
02:50:34.871 --> 02:50:36.960
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they might've started out right off</v>

3731
02:50:36.961 --> 02:50:39.840
<v Speaker 3>the bat trying to joke around and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3732
02:50:39.841 --> 02:50:43.890
<v Speaker 3>said something rude or said something</v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought was funny and you didn't or</v>

3733
02:50:43.891 --> 02:50:45.600
<v Speaker 3>caught you at a bad time or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3734
02:50:46.830 --> 02:50:50.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just try to be aware that I'm causing</v>

3735
02:50:50.431 --> 02:50:54.590
<v Speaker 3>people to be the way they are more often</v>
<v Speaker 3>than you imagine why.</v>

3736
02:50:54.610 --> 02:50:57.300
<v Speaker 3>I also got to think that being the</v>
<v Speaker 3>president has got to be.</v>

3737
02:50:57.570 --> 02:50:59.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to look at yourself the way the</v>

3738
02:50:59.851 --> 02:51:04.620
<v Speaker 3>world looks at you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the harshness of the view of the people</v>

3739
02:51:04.621 --> 02:51:07.740
<v Speaker 3>on the outside looking in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no better way than to be the</v>

3740
02:51:07.741 --> 02:51:08.910
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3741
02:51:09.060 --> 02:51:13.410
<v Speaker 3>he's got people walking down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wilshire blocking traffic,</v>

3742
02:51:13.411 --> 02:51:15.720
<v Speaker 3>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fucking hate him like that.</v>

3743
02:51:15.780 --> 02:51:18.360
<v Speaker 3>If anything is going to cause you a</v>
<v Speaker 3>narcissist,</v>

3744
02:51:18.450 --> 02:51:21.930
<v Speaker 3>clearly obviously he's the guy has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>great love for himself,</v>

3745
02:51:21.931 --> 02:51:24.780
<v Speaker 3>which is part of his success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of why puts his name on the</v>

3746
02:51:24.781 --> 02:51:29.781
<v Speaker 3>buildings is a great love for himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That takes a hit when you see thousands</v>

3747
02:51:30.361 --> 02:51:32.110
<v Speaker 3>of americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of thousands,</v>

3748
02:51:32.111 --> 02:51:35.490
<v Speaker 3>in fact wandering down the street with</v>
<v Speaker 3>signs saying they hate you.</v>

3749
02:51:36.300 --> 02:51:37.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think so?</v>

3750
02:51:37.610 --> 02:51:42.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure it does because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably have your critics as well and</v>

3751
02:51:42.690 --> 02:51:47.190
<v Speaker 3>they're not blocking traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if the fucking people that hated</v>

3752
02:51:47.191 --> 02:51:49.830
<v Speaker 3>you were blocking traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck dilbert,</v>

3753
02:51:49.831 --> 02:51:54.831
<v Speaker 3>and they just had this gigantic stream</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people would chance donald champ,</v>

3754
02:51:55.370 --> 02:51:55.960
<v Speaker 3>k,</v>
<v Speaker 3>k,</v>

3755
02:51:55.960 --> 02:51:58.460
<v Speaker 3>k,</v>
<v Speaker 3>k,</v>

3756
02:51:58.520 --> 02:52:00.330
<v Speaker 3>and the screaming and you know that this</v>
<v Speaker 3>things a true.</v>

3757
02:52:00.390 --> 02:52:04.210
<v Speaker 3>I just imagined myself in the oval</v>
<v Speaker 3>office looking out the window.</v>

3758
02:52:04.211 --> 02:52:06.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm the president and they see the</v>
<v Speaker 3>protesters</v>

3759
02:52:06.970 --> 02:52:09.100
<v Speaker 2>and I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not having a bad day.</v>

3760
02:52:09.810 --> 02:52:14.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm the president of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it gets lost in the noise</v>

3761
02:52:14.111 --> 02:52:17.930
<v Speaker 2>after you get elected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if civilization breaks that</v>

3762
02:52:18.300 --> 02:52:21.610
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about a guy that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone tweets something negative about</v>

3763
02:52:21.611 --> 02:52:22.780
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a tweet back.</v>

3764
02:52:22.781 --> 02:52:24.790
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about A guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody writes an article about him</v>

3765
02:52:24.791 --> 02:52:26.980
<v Speaker 2>in the wall street journal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll go on his twitter page and call</v>

3766
02:52:26.981 --> 02:52:29.020
<v Speaker 2>that magazine or that newspaper a piece</v>
<v Speaker 2>of shit.</v>

3767
02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:32.170
<v Speaker 2>The failed New York times still won't</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop lying about me.</v>

3768
02:52:32.350 --> 02:52:35.590
<v Speaker 2>He's not a guy who was immune to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>impact of criticism against him.</v>

3769
02:52:35.830 --> 02:52:39.550
<v Speaker 2>So if that criticism is coming in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>form of hundreds of thousands of people</v>

3770
02:52:39.551 --> 02:52:43.450
<v Speaker 2>protesting the idea that he's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly become enlightened enough to</v>

3771
02:52:43.451 --> 02:52:44.710
<v Speaker 2>ignore that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally,</v>

3772
02:52:44.880 --> 02:52:46.750
<v Speaker 2>but don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't miss the pattern.</v>

3773
02:52:46.870 --> 02:52:48.790
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he attacks professionals,</v>

3774
02:52:49.410 --> 02:52:51.820
<v Speaker 2>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes after people who were in the</v>

3775
02:52:51.821 --> 02:52:52.654
<v Speaker 2>cage.</v>

3776
02:52:52.710 --> 02:52:55.390
<v Speaker 2>If you're not in the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're cool.</v>

3777
02:52:56.050 --> 02:52:59.860
<v Speaker 2>so those people on the street that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>just screaming and what is he said about</v>

3778
02:52:59.861 --> 02:53:02.800
<v Speaker 2>the protesters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what he said is kind of</v>

3779
02:53:02.801 --> 02:53:06.400
<v Speaker 2>interesting because I think what he did</v>
<v Speaker 2>say is that it's great that they have</v>

3780
02:53:06.401 --> 02:53:09.700
<v Speaker 2>these rights to protests and he likes</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that they're all getting</v>

3781
02:53:09.701 --> 02:53:12.070
<v Speaker 2>together and voice their opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're all going to work this out</v>

3782
02:53:12.071 --> 02:53:13.650
<v Speaker 2>together and he likes her energy or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3783
02:53:13.680 --> 02:53:14.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

3784
02:53:14.741 --> 02:53:15.590
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

3785
02:53:15.640 --> 02:53:17.440
<v Speaker 2>that's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3786
02:53:17.650 --> 02:53:18.760
<v Speaker 2>If any of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the,</v>

3787
02:53:18.761 --> 02:53:21.330
<v Speaker 2>if the parade had been led by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3788
02:53:21.340 --> 02:53:24.790
<v Speaker 2>a reporter for the New York times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have eviscerated the</v>

3789
02:53:24.791 --> 02:53:28.150
<v Speaker 2>professional and he wouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>touched anybody behind him because</v>

3790
02:53:28.151 --> 02:53:29.650
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The citizens.</v>

3791
02:53:30.260 --> 02:53:31.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>

3792
02:53:31.990 --> 02:53:32.540
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3793
02:53:32.540 --> 02:53:37.270
<v Speaker 2>you make a very convincing argument for</v>
<v Speaker 2>this all being a positive event.</v>

3794
02:53:37.780 --> 02:53:40.850
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the best arguments</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it being a positive event.</v>

3795
02:53:40.870 --> 02:53:44.470
<v Speaker 2>This is the first time ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had someone who has no,</v>

3796
02:53:44.570 --> 02:53:49.480
<v Speaker 2>no political background or aspirations</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're already famous and</v>

3797
02:53:49.481 --> 02:53:51.340
<v Speaker 2>successful and they become the</v>
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>

3798
02:53:52.560 --> 02:53:55.000
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to get to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was a guy who wants to dismantle</v>

3799
02:53:55.001 --> 02:53:56.590
<v Speaker 2>a system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of the things he said about</v>

3800
02:53:56.591 --> 02:53:58.030
<v Speaker 2>passing bills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

3801
02:53:58.180 --> 02:54:00.310
<v Speaker 2>when you pass a new bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to get rid of two old ones.</v>

3802
02:54:00.990 --> 02:54:01.823
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3803
02:54:01.980 --> 02:54:03.160
<v Speaker 2>regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulation,</v>

3804
02:54:03.161 --> 02:54:05.920
<v Speaker 2>excuse me by my first reaction to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

3805
02:54:05.921 --> 02:54:08.350
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a stupid oversimplification,</v>

3806
02:54:08.740 --> 02:54:12.800
<v Speaker 2>but I'll bet there are enough old laws</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they want to get rid of any way</v>

3807
02:54:13.190 --> 02:54:16.180
<v Speaker 2>that for a long time you could get rid</v>
<v Speaker 2>of two for one.</v>

3808
02:54:16.720 --> 02:54:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there might be some ridiculous ones that</v>

3809
02:54:18.251 --> 02:54:19.320
<v Speaker 2>we could get rid of it.</v>

3810
02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:22.510
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible you can't do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>rule forever.</v>

3811
02:54:22.780 --> 02:54:26.270
<v Speaker 2>And of course dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deregulation,</v>

3812
02:54:26.340 --> 02:54:28.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to environmental efforts</v>

3813
02:54:28.491 --> 02:54:30.670
<v Speaker 2>is one thing that terrifies people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>

3814
02:54:30.710 --> 02:54:33.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>climate denier a concern.</v>

3815
02:54:33.701 --> 02:54:35.950
<v Speaker 2>That's a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something that could affect us.</v>

3816
02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3817
02:54:37.511 --> 02:54:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because people have been begging me</v>

3818
02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:44.860
<v Speaker 2>please to give any argument that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>make Donald Trump look like a science</v>

3819
02:54:44.890 --> 02:54:46.960
<v Speaker 2>retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm soRry I shouldn't use that word.</v>

3820
02:54:46.990 --> 02:54:50.050
<v Speaker 2>I apollo use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have any bearing on science.</v>

3821
02:54:50.230 --> 02:54:54.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not a medical term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Retard is people that are retarded with</v>

3822
02:54:54.521 --> 02:54:56.770
<v Speaker 2>their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're slow to catch on.</v>

3823
02:54:57.010 --> 02:54:58.600
<v Speaker 2>And we're not talking aBout mental</v>
<v Speaker 2>illness.</v>

3824
02:54:58.601 --> 02:55:00.850
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about retards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright?</v>

3825
02:55:01.470 --> 02:55:04.000
<v Speaker 2>But I apologize if anybody was offended</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you're going to do that.</v>

3826
02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:05.700
<v Speaker 1>They don't let you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3827
02:55:07.010 --> 02:55:09.740
<v Speaker 1>so here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's my best argument.</v>

3828
02:55:09.890 --> 02:55:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I'll just play lawyer for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>second and I'm going to defend donald</v>

3829
02:55:13.491 --> 02:55:18.491
<v Speaker 1>trump's climate change position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which disagrees with all of science was.</v>

3830
02:55:19.900 --> 02:55:21.740
<v Speaker 1>So you're starting from a deep hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3831
02:55:21.770 --> 02:55:25.940
<v Speaker 1>So you acknowledged that they've got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough task year to what's state his</v>

3832
02:55:25.941 --> 02:55:30.230
<v Speaker 1>opinion for what is his position first?</v>
<v Speaker 1>His opinion is that we don't need to</v>

3833
02:55:30.231 --> 02:55:35.231
<v Speaker 1>actively work on climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather he would rather work actively on</v>

3834
02:55:36.201 --> 02:55:41.000
<v Speaker 1>cleaning the air and the water and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think he thinks that gets us to the same</v>

3835
02:55:41.001 --> 02:55:42.430
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3836
02:55:42.860 --> 02:55:44.790
<v Speaker 1>and it might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3837
02:55:45.050 --> 02:55:46.550
<v Speaker 1>here's my argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

3838
02:55:46.551 --> 02:55:48.650
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to speculate a little bit here</v>

3839
02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:50.990
<v Speaker 1>so I don't want to put too many words</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the president's mouth,</v>

3840
02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:55.070
<v Speaker 1>but I think that he's separating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>data collection part of the science,</v>

3841
02:55:55.071 --> 02:55:59.030
<v Speaker 1>which is you measure things and sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough temperatures seems to be changing</v>

3842
02:55:59.031 --> 02:56:02.660
<v Speaker 1>and historically significant ways and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure enough,</v>

3843
02:56:02.661 --> 02:56:05.510
<v Speaker 1>humans seem to be behind some part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that change.</v>

3844
02:56:06.050 --> 02:56:11.050
<v Speaker 1>I think trump accepts that part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second part of it is not the data</v>

3845
02:56:11.361 --> 02:56:15.530
<v Speaker 1>collection is the complicated models</v>
<v Speaker 1>that predict what happens with all this</v>

3846
02:56:15.531 --> 02:56:19.070
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the trump things that those</v>

3847
02:56:19.071 --> 02:56:21.950
<v Speaker 1>models are unreliable and not credible</v>
<v Speaker 1>and probably bullshit,</v>

3848
02:56:22.370 --> 02:56:26.540
<v Speaker 1>just like he thought the polls were</v>
<v Speaker 1>inaccurate,</v>

3849
02:56:27.070 --> 02:56:30.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember you just watched him defy every</v>

3850
02:56:30.801 --> 02:56:33.380
<v Speaker 1>expert in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent of pollsters said,</v>

3851
02:56:33.620 --> 02:56:34.460
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump.</v>

3852
02:56:34.490 --> 02:56:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Look at our numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This could not be more clear.</v>

3853
02:56:37.071 --> 02:56:40.670
<v Speaker 1>It's independent people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are legitimate professionals.</v>

3854
02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:44.450
<v Speaker 1>There's no freaking way that you win</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these numbers,</v>

3855
02:56:45.230 --> 02:56:47.390
<v Speaker 1>and Donald Trump said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe the polls,</v>

3856
02:56:48.020 --> 02:56:49.920
<v Speaker 1>and it was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump was right,</v>

3857
02:56:50.020 --> 02:56:53.720
<v Speaker 1>but there's a big difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>poles and scientific measurements of our</v>

3858
02:56:53.721 --> 02:56:54.770
<v Speaker 1>carbon footprint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3859
02:56:54.810 --> 02:56:57.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not gonna I'm not going to leap</v>

3860
02:56:57.861 --> 02:56:59.340
<v Speaker 1>and say case closed based on it.</v>

3861
02:56:59.660 --> 02:57:01.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to say that through our</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

3862
02:57:01.431 --> 02:57:05.300
<v Speaker 1>If you try to find the context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many times have we built a</v>

3863
02:57:05.301 --> 02:57:09.230
<v Speaker 1>complicated model on that scale and got</v>
<v Speaker 1>it right?</v>

3864
02:57:09.630 --> 02:57:12.110
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's nobody who's doing a good job</v>

3865
02:57:12.111 --> 02:57:15.080
<v Speaker 1>of predicting where the economy will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>next year.</v>

3866
02:57:15.081 --> 02:57:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Those are very similar in the sense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of variables and different</v>

3867
02:57:18.381 --> 02:57:19.910
<v Speaker 1>models and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3868
02:57:20.350 --> 02:57:22.070
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that turns out to be just random.</v>

3869
02:57:22.820 --> 02:57:26.180
<v Speaker 1>If the economy's largely based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence,</v>

3870
02:57:26.181 --> 02:57:28.160
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of factors involved in</v>

3871
02:57:28.161 --> 02:57:30.800
<v Speaker 1>the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much is involved in the atmosphere.</v>

3872
02:57:30.890 --> 02:57:32.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can,</v>

3873
02:57:32.511 --> 02:57:36.890
<v Speaker 1>their models figuring out that there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a volcano over here,</v>

3874
02:57:36.891 --> 02:57:39.920
<v Speaker 1>there's something happened in the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you didn't expect.</v>

3875
02:57:39.921 --> 02:57:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some seaweed,</v>

3876
02:57:42.960 --> 02:57:44.840
<v Speaker 1>hobo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you don't think they have accounted</v>

3877
02:57:44.841 --> 02:57:48.650
<v Speaker 1>for that when they're talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>models of the earth being warmer every</v>

3878
02:57:48.650 --> 02:57:51.470
<v Speaker 1>year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I the past decade and scientists being</v>

3879
02:57:51.860 --> 02:57:54.260
<v Speaker 1>incredibly concerned that have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>studying this their whole lives,</v>

3880
02:57:54.470 --> 02:57:58.190
<v Speaker 1>seeing unprecedented levels of change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that that's.</v>

3881
02:57:58.280 --> 02:58:00.860
<v Speaker 1>I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's where the analogy to the,</v>

3882
02:58:01.100 --> 02:58:01.980
<v Speaker 1>the polling</v>

3883
02:58:02.070 --> 02:58:04.680
<v Speaker 2>is similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all thought the pilot polling was</v>

3884
02:58:04.681 --> 02:58:07.920
<v Speaker 2>reliable because it's sort of math and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3885
02:58:07.940 --> 02:58:11.430
<v Speaker 2>the science seems to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you realized later is that there</v>

3886
02:58:11.431 --> 02:58:15.180
<v Speaker 2>was a whole bunch of judgment that went</v>
<v Speaker 2>into which variable to include and you</v>

3887
02:58:15.181 --> 02:58:15.860
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

3888
02:58:15.860 --> 02:58:18.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assumptions about who's going to show up</v>

3889
02:58:18.061 --> 02:58:21.570
<v Speaker 2>on polling day and nobody could have any</v>
<v Speaker 2>good idea what was going to happen.</v>

3890
02:58:22.050 --> 02:58:26.170
<v Speaker 2>So the most important part of the models</v>
<v Speaker 2>was literally just people sit in the</v>

3891
02:58:26.171 --> 02:58:27.090
<v Speaker 2>room say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3892
02:58:27.091 --> 02:58:30.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be like last time these</v>
<v Speaker 2>case with science though,</v>

3893
02:58:30.541 --> 02:58:32.970
<v Speaker 2>and climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make sense to me.</v>

3894
02:58:33.060 --> 02:58:36.030
<v Speaker 2>I think that it seems likely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

3895
02:58:36.031 --> 02:58:39.180
<v Speaker 2>this would be subject to smarter people</v>
<v Speaker 2>correcting me and I,</v>

3896
02:58:39.181 --> 02:58:41.730
<v Speaker 2>I could easily be corrected on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3897
02:58:41.760 --> 02:58:44.490
<v Speaker 2>I think that when you have big</v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated models and lots of people</v>

3898
02:58:44.491 --> 02:58:47.460
<v Speaker 2>working on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are probably places in which</v>

3899
02:58:47.461 --> 02:58:48.660
<v Speaker 2>people are using judgment.</v>

3900
02:58:48.960 --> 02:58:50.580
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this just be a,</v>

3901
02:58:50.730 --> 02:58:51.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to make the point,</v>

3902
02:58:52.290 --> 02:58:55.680
<v Speaker 2>there may be two sets of data and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could say,</v>

3903
02:58:55.681 --> 02:58:58.920
<v Speaker 2>well this one seems more reliable than</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one because of whatever.</v>

3904
02:58:59.400 --> 02:59:02.550
<v Speaker 2>So I would think they're probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>different scientists could get wildly</v>

3905
02:59:02.551 --> 02:59:07.200
<v Speaker 2>different projections and all of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>tapping the same source of data just</v>

3906
02:59:07.201 --> 02:59:10.440
<v Speaker 2>like the pollsters got the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>answers,</v>

3907
02:59:10.710 --> 02:59:12.120
<v Speaker 2>but they're all looking at the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>data.</v>

3908
02:59:12.570 --> 02:59:16.590
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I really don't see the connection</v>

3909
02:59:16.591 --> 02:59:19.500
<v Speaker 2>between that and the polls because</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows the polls is based on a</v>

3910
02:59:19.501 --> 02:59:23.430
<v Speaker 2>very small group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the vast majority of the problem</v>

3911
02:59:23.460 --> 02:59:28.460
<v Speaker 2>of the population is largely uncounted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we really weren't.</v>

3912
02:59:28.500 --> 02:59:31.020
<v Speaker 2>We were guessing and gauging but their</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>

3913
02:59:31.050 --> 02:59:35.400
<v Speaker 2>But that wasn't the problem because</v>
<v Speaker 2>polling is scientific enough that it can</v>

3914
02:59:35.401 --> 02:59:36.510
<v Speaker 2>capture it in some way.</v>

3915
02:59:36.600 --> 02:59:37.980
<v Speaker 2>But they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conceit is,</v>

3916
02:59:37.981 --> 02:59:40.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to admit that there's a certain</v>

3917
02:59:40.681 --> 02:59:43.830
<v Speaker 2>percentage that we absolutely know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not measuring those people when</v>

3918
02:59:43.831 --> 02:59:45.750
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about the temperature of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth.</v>

3919
02:59:46.130 --> 02:59:50.490
<v Speaker 2>He or you're absolutely measuring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're measuring the climate all over</v>

3920
02:59:50.491 --> 02:59:52.290
<v Speaker 2>the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're actually measuring,</v>

3921
02:59:52.320 --> 02:59:56.130
<v Speaker 2>measuring the sheer heart numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no opinion based on there's no</v>

3922
02:59:56.131 --> 02:59:59.910
<v Speaker 2>fluctuation of opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm agreeing with you that the data</v>

3923
02:59:59.911 --> 03:00:03.890
<v Speaker 2>collection is probably pretty solid</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's an extra.</v>

3924
03:00:03.900 --> 03:00:06.690
<v Speaker 2>The interpretation of the data is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're disagreeing with.</v>

3925
03:00:06.720 --> 03:00:09.270
<v Speaker 2>By the time you put it into an economic</v>
<v Speaker 2>model,</v>

3926
03:00:09.330 --> 03:00:13.640
<v Speaker 2>there's almost certainly some fuckery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a judgment call that somebody who</v>

3927
03:00:13.641 --> 03:00:18.210
<v Speaker 2>doesn't think as a judgment call that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost guaranteed to be part of the</v>

3928
03:00:18.211 --> 03:00:20.220
<v Speaker 2>model building procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

3929
03:00:20.221 --> 03:00:23.250
<v Speaker 2>I would love for somebody to educate me</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this because I've never talked to</v>

3930
03:00:23.251 --> 03:00:26.280
<v Speaker 2>somebody whose job it is to build a</v>
<v Speaker 2>climate model.</v>

3931
03:00:26.700 --> 03:00:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to sit in a room and say,</v>

3932
03:00:28.230 --> 03:00:33.230
<v Speaker 2>is there any part of this where two</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are both experts could have</v>

3933
03:00:33.241 --> 03:00:37.320
<v Speaker 2>picked a different variable and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost certain that's the case because</v>

3934
03:00:37.321 --> 03:00:40.290
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of variables in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated and so he's going to be the</v>

3935
03:00:40.291 --> 03:00:41.011
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3936
03:00:41.011 --> 03:00:43.890
<v Speaker 2>But when you have a mass consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to scientists,</v>

3937
03:00:43.891 --> 03:00:47.310
<v Speaker 2>you're not talking about politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not talking about cnn versus fox</v>

3938
03:00:47.311 --> 03:00:48.960
<v Speaker 2>news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about scientists,</v>

3939
03:00:48.961 --> 03:00:51.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have a vast consensus that</v>

3940
03:00:51.271 --> 03:00:55.410
<v Speaker 2>believe that we have a real issue with</v>
<v Speaker 2>our carbon footprint and that we really</v>

3941
03:00:55.411 --> 03:00:59.500
<v Speaker 2>need to slow down the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pollutants and the particulates we put</v>

3942
03:00:59.501 --> 03:01:00.334
<v Speaker 2>into the air.</v>

3943
03:01:00.490 --> 03:01:03.790
<v Speaker 1>So is that a word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Particulants particles.</v>

3944
03:01:04.090 --> 03:01:07.330
<v Speaker 1>What's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the word with like the thing that</v>

3945
03:01:07.331 --> 03:01:10.510
<v Speaker 1>people worry about a lot of is not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3946
03:01:10.600 --> 03:01:13.540
<v Speaker 1>like the carbon in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the fucking dirt,</v>

3947
03:01:13.780 --> 03:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>the dust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3948
03:01:14.771 --> 03:01:17.350
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual pollution being.</v>

3949
03:01:17.370 --> 03:01:19.450
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the third leg of my,</v>

3950
03:01:19.451 --> 03:01:20.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particulates.</v>

3951
03:01:20.531 --> 03:01:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was right.</v>

3952
03:01:21.100 --> 03:01:21.911
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

3953
03:01:21.911 --> 03:01:24.950
<v Speaker 1>I love my defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So trump's thing is clean the water,</v>

3954
03:01:24.970 --> 03:01:26.290
<v Speaker 1>clean the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good move,</v>

3955
03:01:26.350 --> 03:01:29.710
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like that's going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to the same place right now.</v>

3956
03:01:29.711 --> 03:01:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe give you another really hot.</v>

3957
03:01:32.111 --> 03:01:33.820
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me give you another analogy.</v>

3958
03:01:34.660 --> 03:01:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put solar panels on my house when I</v>

3959
03:01:37.301 --> 03:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>built it nine years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3960
03:01:40.200 --> 03:01:43.990
<v Speaker 1>what those solar panels have saved me</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough electricity and I can predict</v>

3961
03:01:43.991 --> 03:01:47.560
<v Speaker 1>forward that I'll definitely get my</v>
<v Speaker 1>money back from putting on solar panels.</v>

3962
03:01:47.920 --> 03:01:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it a good economic idea to put those</v>

3963
03:01:51.611 --> 03:01:53.710
<v Speaker 1>solar panels on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing what you know,</v>

3964
03:01:54.130 --> 03:01:58.690
<v Speaker 1>that the cost will more than be made up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my savings.</v>

3965
03:01:58.691 --> 03:02:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Was that a good idea for me to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it wrong.</v>

3966
03:02:01.930 --> 03:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>It was a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible idea wrong.</v>

3967
03:02:04.090 --> 03:02:06.640
<v Speaker 1>And I knew it at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the way,</v>

3968
03:02:06.641 --> 03:02:08.560
<v Speaker 1>I have a background in economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my,</v>

3969
03:02:08.590 --> 03:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>my degree mba from berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why is it terrible idea?</v>

3970
03:02:12.730 --> 03:02:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Because I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what happened to the cost of</v>

3971
03:02:15.971 --> 03:02:18.340
<v Speaker 1>solar cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped so quickly,</v>

3972
03:02:18.610 --> 03:02:21.730
<v Speaker 1>that if I had simply waited three years</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bought it,</v>

3973
03:02:21.731 --> 03:02:24.640
<v Speaker 1>then I would have only you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years of savings,</v>

3974
03:02:25.060 --> 03:02:29.260
<v Speaker 1>but I would have gotten it as such as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower price that I would pay it back</v>

3975
03:02:29.261 --> 03:02:33.910
<v Speaker 1>much faster and then it'd be gravy from</v>
<v Speaker 1>there on if you only wanted to look at</v>

3976
03:02:33.911 --> 03:02:35.800
<v Speaker 1>it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you didn't take into</v>

3977
03:02:35.801 --> 03:02:40.060
<v Speaker 1>consideration the variable of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>affecting the carbon footprint of the</v>

3978
03:02:40.061 --> 03:02:43.900
<v Speaker 1>earth by gathering up your electricity</v>
<v Speaker 1>for three years due to convention.</v>

3979
03:02:44.260 --> 03:02:48.520
<v Speaker 1>That's actually why I did it and so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>made made a bad economic decision</v>

3980
03:02:48.880 --> 03:02:51.520
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we call these stupid rich have to</v>

3981
03:02:51.521 --> 03:02:52.280
<v Speaker 1>go first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3982
03:02:52.280 --> 03:02:55.090
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't a terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't a good idea.</v>

3983
03:02:55.120 --> 03:02:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Economically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very good idea.</v>

3984
03:02:56.981 --> 03:02:59.910
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a good idea economically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economically.</v>

3985
03:02:59.911 --> 03:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sure you can't consider all sorts</v>

3986
03:03:02.051 --> 03:03:03.080
<v Speaker 1>of other variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

3987
03:03:03.100 --> 03:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>well all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all analogies breakdown ultimately.</v>

3988
03:03:05.771 --> 03:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>So I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're good for.</v>

3989
03:03:08.120 --> 03:03:09.750
<v Speaker 1>They're good for explaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3990
03:03:09.760 --> 03:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>If they're not good for proving a point</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say that.</v>

3991
03:03:12.790 --> 03:03:16.800
<v Speaker 1>So here's the analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Odds are that technology is going to</v>

3992
03:03:16.810 --> 03:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>save us from climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3993
03:03:19.691 --> 03:03:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there already,</v>

3994
03:03:21.031 --> 03:03:22.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3995
03:03:22.420 --> 03:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>on the drawing board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas for putting like a giant hose into</v>

3996
03:03:26.051 --> 03:03:31.051
<v Speaker 1>the upper atmosphere and in somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>sucking bad things that will suck all</v>

3997
03:03:31.151 --> 03:03:34.270
<v Speaker 1>the clouds out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet.</v>

3998
03:03:34.450 --> 03:03:36.910
<v Speaker 1>But chances are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chances are,</v>

3999
03:03:36.990 --> 03:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might not want to take this risk.</v>

4000
03:03:38.741 --> 03:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even saying you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she has this are if you waited five</v>

4001
03:03:42.371 --> 03:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>or 10 years and then got serious about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

4002
03:03:45.340 --> 03:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably be in a better position</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we'd have better technology.</v>

4003
03:03:48.581 --> 03:03:50.680
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and starting from that point,</v>

4004
03:03:50.681 --> 03:03:54.130
<v Speaker 1>we just be in a better place or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying we should do that.</v>

4005
03:03:54.700 --> 03:03:57.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that you can't know this</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting now is the</v>

4006
03:03:57.980 --> 03:04:00.560
<v Speaker 2>smart thing because like my solar</v>
<v Speaker 2>panels,</v>

4007
03:04:00.890 --> 03:04:04.910
<v Speaker 2>the technology's changing so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that waiting a little bit until you</v>

4008
03:04:04.911 --> 03:04:08.840
<v Speaker 2>really can get some purchase with some</v>
<v Speaker 2>good technology and just go balls to the</v>

4009
03:04:08.841 --> 03:04:10.350
<v Speaker 2>wall and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

4010
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:13.670
<v Speaker 2>fucking $500,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to spend now because we've</v>

4011
03:04:13.671 --> 03:04:16.340
<v Speaker 2>got the solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is a convenient way that</v>

4012
03:04:16.341 --> 03:04:19.880
<v Speaker 2>you're interfacing with the software</v>
<v Speaker 2>simulation that we're all trapped in</v>

4013
03:04:20.630 --> 03:04:25.630
<v Speaker 2>your choosing to take this path of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>success based on technological</v>

4014
03:04:26.211 --> 03:04:30.830
<v Speaker 2>progression rather than based on taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>care of mother earth.</v>

4015
03:04:30.890 --> 03:04:32.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

4016
03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:37.580
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't every model assume that</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything stays the same and there's</v>

4017
03:04:37.581 --> 03:04:38.570
<v Speaker 2>just more of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4018
03:04:38.840 --> 03:04:43.220
<v Speaker 2>So here's one thing I can guarantee your</v>
<v Speaker 2>climate change model does not include,</v>

4019
03:04:43.320 --> 03:04:46.220
<v Speaker 2>okay fucking hose to the upper</v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere.</v>

4020
03:04:47.060 --> 03:04:50.240
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about until you brought</v>
<v Speaker 2>it up and isn't that going to be the</v>

4021
03:04:50.241 --> 03:04:53.330
<v Speaker 2>biggest factor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be the technological change that</v>

4022
03:04:53.331 --> 03:04:56.630
<v Speaker 2>happens between now and that in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole point of alarming us.</v>

4023
03:04:56.840 --> 03:04:59.630
<v Speaker 2>So we'll work hard on the technological</v>
<v Speaker 2>changes.</v>

4024
03:04:59.690 --> 03:05:02.600
<v Speaker 2>I thought they should make a skyscraper</v>
<v Speaker 2>sized air filter.</v>

4025
03:05:03.900 --> 03:05:07.540
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the plans there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a,</v>

4026
03:05:07.580 --> 03:05:10.220
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they could actually take that</v>

4027
03:05:10.221 --> 03:05:12.140
<v Speaker 2>carbon out of the atmosphere and use it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for fuel.</v>

4028
03:05:12.210 --> 03:05:13.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Burn it,</v>

4029
03:05:13.500 --> 03:05:14.370
<v Speaker 2>burn it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4030
03:05:14.430 --> 03:05:18.020
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some amazing things in</v>
<v Speaker 2>headlines recently,</v>

4031
03:05:18.021 --> 03:05:21.770
<v Speaker 2>but I never trust any of them and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally makes sense that if we can clean</v>

4032
03:05:21.771 --> 03:05:24.260
<v Speaker 2>air in your house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know we have that right behind</v>

4033
03:05:24.261 --> 03:05:26.060
<v Speaker 2>you right there for when people smoke</v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes,</v>

4034
03:05:26.061 --> 03:05:28.260
<v Speaker 2>we have that air filter and it's pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

4035
03:05:28.261 --> 03:05:32.360
<v Speaker 2>If someone can sit in your seat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke a cigarette and this room will be</v>

4036
03:05:32.361 --> 03:05:34.790
<v Speaker 2>bearable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah you can.</v>

4037
03:05:34.840 --> 03:05:38.450
<v Speaker 2>You can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very simple portable unit.</v>

4038
03:05:38.690 --> 03:05:41.090
<v Speaker 2>Some buildings have very sophisticated</v>
<v Speaker 2>units,</v>

4039
03:05:41.120 --> 03:05:45.020
<v Speaker 2>so I think the technology for scrubbing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the atmosphere already exists.</v>

4040
03:05:45.020 --> 03:05:48.950
<v Speaker 2>It's just not implementing it on a large</v>
<v Speaker 2>scale is not economical.</v>

4041
03:05:49.040 --> 03:05:53.030
<v Speaker 2>So just like my soldier pedals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the point is if you started now and</v>

4042
03:05:53.031 --> 03:05:56.710
<v Speaker 2>spend $500,000,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might get a billion dollars with a</v>

4043
03:05:56.900 --> 03:05:59.660
<v Speaker 2>benefit because you don't have the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

4044
03:06:00.020 --> 03:06:03.200
<v Speaker 2>If you waited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had the right technology and then</v>

4045
03:06:03.201 --> 03:06:05.810
<v Speaker 2>put your effort into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might get it for cheap.</v>

4046
03:06:06.260 --> 03:06:07.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know that.</v>

4047
03:06:07.700 --> 03:06:09.590
<v Speaker 2>So that that's a risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a risk.</v>

4048
03:06:09.591 --> 03:06:14.591
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is got to assess that a is</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more comfortable than the idea of a</v>

4049
03:06:16.071 --> 03:06:21.071
<v Speaker 2>climate change denier perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a climate change optimist,</v>

4050
03:06:21.410 --> 03:06:21.921
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4051
03:06:21.921 --> 03:06:25.190
<v Speaker 2>I know it's kind of fucked up now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've got some stuff in the works.</v>

4052
03:06:25.280 --> 03:06:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We looked at the progressions that are</v>

4053
03:06:27.051 --> 03:06:31.550
<v Speaker 2>going to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think trump is trying to have it</v>

4054
03:06:31.551 --> 03:06:32.450
<v Speaker 2>both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4055
03:06:32.451 --> 03:06:34.370
<v Speaker 2>he's got people he needs to satisfying</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right,</v>

4056
03:06:34.400 --> 03:06:36.200
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't want to be a crazy man</v>
<v Speaker 2>and left.</v>

4057
03:06:36.600 --> 03:06:40.760
<v Speaker 2>so we've had testified in some story</v>
<v Speaker 2>that both people can find some comfort</v>

4058
03:06:40.761 --> 03:06:45.320
<v Speaker 2>in because this is such a big issue and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that middle ground is where he's</v>

4059
03:06:45.321 --> 03:06:47.960
<v Speaker 2>trying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's sort of ab testing it now by saying</v>

4060
03:06:48.290 --> 03:06:49.900
<v Speaker 2>let's clean the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4061
03:06:50.420 --> 03:06:53.060
<v Speaker 2>clean the water because how do you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

4062
03:06:53.480 --> 03:06:54.261
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4063
03:06:54.261 --> 03:06:55.580
<v Speaker 2>you do all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you know,</v>

4064
03:06:55.590 --> 03:06:57.390
<v Speaker 2>but you really can't do that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4065
03:06:57.410 --> 03:06:59.190
<v Speaker 2>I clean all the water and clean all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>

4066
03:06:59.360 --> 03:07:01.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean you would have to woof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well,</v>

4067
03:07:01.441 --> 03:07:03.930
<v Speaker 2>but the technology is to get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4068
03:07:03.960 --> 03:07:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Are going to be at Least overlapping</v>
<v Speaker 2>with whatever you need to do with</v>

4069
03:07:06.601 --> 03:07:07.680
<v Speaker 2>climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully,</v>

4070
03:07:07.890 --> 03:07:10.230
<v Speaker 2>because you still want your electric car</v>
<v Speaker 2>either way.</v>

4071
03:07:11.010 --> 03:07:13.470
<v Speaker 2>It's just different way to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also gotta think that whatever</v>

4072
03:07:13.471 --> 03:07:16.530
<v Speaker 2>byproducts that are in the atmosphere</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the water,</v>

4073
03:07:16.860 --> 03:07:19.020
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff could probably be used</v>
<v Speaker 2>for something.</v>

4074
03:07:19.070 --> 03:07:19.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4075
03:07:19.730 --> 03:07:21.240
<v Speaker 2>the whatever these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4076
03:07:21.360 --> 03:07:23.700
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's already,</v>

4077
03:07:23.910 --> 03:07:26.220
<v Speaker 2>at least in the lab they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've made it useful.</v>

4078
03:07:26.430 --> 03:07:30.740
<v Speaker 2>That will be really fascinating if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out a way someday to get to a</v>

4079
03:07:30.750 --> 03:07:33.210
<v Speaker 2>zero emission state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4080
03:07:33.211 --> 03:07:37.890
<v Speaker 2>where everything we use gets recycled</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we keep the air pure and we just</v>

4081
03:07:37.891 --> 03:07:42.660
<v Speaker 2>figured out a way to be completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient and how we burn things or how</v>

4082
03:07:42.661 --> 03:07:46.290
<v Speaker 2>we make things or how we recycle things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that we all leave.</v>

4083
03:07:46.880 --> 03:07:48.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4084
03:07:48.270 --> 03:07:51.960
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're saying economically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once it becomes economically feasible,</v>

4085
03:07:52.040 --> 03:07:57.040
<v Speaker 2>there's becomes like this big financial</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom and taking whatever the particular</v>

4086
03:07:57.781 --> 03:07:58.560
<v Speaker 2>incident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4087
03:07:58.560 --> 03:08:02.170
<v Speaker 2>the carbon or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the atmosphere and you make mass</v>

4088
03:08:02.171 --> 03:08:04.140
<v Speaker 2>amounts of money from doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4089
03:08:04.220 --> 03:08:07.020
<v Speaker 2>and people figure out a way to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>really rich doing it.</v>

4090
03:08:07.110 --> 03:08:08.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody just got to figure out a way to</v>

4091
03:08:08.731 --> 03:08:11.560
<v Speaker 2>get rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every solution has that.</v>

4092
03:08:11.760 --> 03:08:14.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then somebody found out a way to get</v>

4093
03:08:14.461 --> 03:08:14.911
<v Speaker 2>rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>prepared yourself for something like</v>

4097
03:08:22.561 --> 03:08:25.050
