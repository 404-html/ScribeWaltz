00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.600
<v Speaker 1>We've talked a little bit,</v>

2
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.463
<v Speaker 1>I think in this,</v>

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.480
<v Speaker 1>in this series about Pinocchio,</v>

4
00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:11.890
<v Speaker 1>but if we have it doesn't matter.</v>

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.283
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.600
<v Speaker 1>you see there's Jimminy cricket at the opening of the Pinocchio movie</v>

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.030
<v Speaker 1>pointing to a star,</v>

8
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:24.120
<v Speaker 1>which is roughly the Nativity Star for all intents and purposes.</v>

9
00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:25.280
<v Speaker 1>And it's um,</v>

10
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a symbolic indicator of something diamond light and pure,</v>

11
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.710
<v Speaker 1>right glimmering in the darkness that's transcendent and above the horizon upon</v>

12
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>which to fix your eyes.</v>

13
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the thing is you need that technically.</v>

14
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:46.551
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you need that is because we know enough about psychology now to</v>

15
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:49.940
<v Speaker 1>know that almost all of the positive emotion that you're going to experience in</v>

16
00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:52.970
<v Speaker 1>your life and positive emotion is analgesic by the way,</v>

17
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:53.211
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:54.470
<v Speaker 1>It actually quells pain.</v>

19
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just positive.</v>

20
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:57.260
<v Speaker 1>It also gets rid of negative,</v>

21
00:00:57.261 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 1>which is a big plus.</v>

22
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Almost all the positive emotion that you're going to feel.</v>

23
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.440
<v Speaker 1>You're going to feel in relationship to a goal because you feel positive emotion</v>

24
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 1>as you approach a goal.</v>

25
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.280
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to feel positive emotion,</v>

26
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:11.480
<v Speaker 1>then you need a goal.</v>

27
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.381
<v Speaker 1>And then you might think,</v>

28
00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:12.501
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

29
00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:14.840
<v Speaker 1>if you want to maximize that positive emotion,</v>

30
00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:18.680
<v Speaker 1>which is enthusiasm and also what pulls you out into the world as well as</v>

31
00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:19.514
<v Speaker 1>feeling good,</v>

32
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.370
<v Speaker 1>then you need the best possible goal.</v>

33
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Well that because that's going to engage the largest segments of the year being</v>

34
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 1>like if your goal is too narrow,</v>

35
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker 1>then a bunch of you isn't going to be on board for it.</v>

36
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

37
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>If the goal is well developed and multifaceted,</v>

38
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>then all of you can partake in that.</v>

39
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Even your negative elements,</v>

40
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>even your anger and your fear can get on board with that,</v>

41
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:45.330
<v Speaker 1>let's say so you need a goal,</v>

42
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:45.631
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

43
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>that's worthy.</v>

44
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>You got us.</v>

45
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.061
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

46
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:48.181
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

47
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>You need a goal that justifies the tragedy and malevolence of life.</v>

48
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be the bottom line.</v>

49
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe you think,</v>

50
00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:55.201
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:56.550
<v Speaker 1>there's no goal that can do that.</v>

52
00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:56.911
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

53
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:57.744
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

54
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.060
<v Speaker 1>there are still better and worse schools,</v>

55
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.281
<v Speaker 1>so and I,</v>

56
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not convinced that there are no goals that can do that.</v>

57
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that's an open question.</v>

58
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>You'd never know that until you pursued the proper goal long enough to find out</v>

59
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>who you would be as a consequence of pursuing it.</v>

60
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>That's also your destiny or your existential voyage,</v>

61
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:20.851
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>It's also not something that anyone else can do for you.</v>

63
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Someone can say,</v>

64
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>get your act together for Christ's sake and get it.</v>

65
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Get good at it.</v>

66
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

67
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>that'll make the world unfold best for you.</v>

68
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>But there's no way you can know that without doing it.</v>

69
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.340
<v Speaker 1>And unless you think you've done a particularly stellar job of that,</v>

70
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 1>then you have no reason to doubt its potential validity.</v>
