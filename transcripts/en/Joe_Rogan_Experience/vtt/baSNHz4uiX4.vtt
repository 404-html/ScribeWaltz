00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:00.853
<v Speaker 1>In a centrifuge or they spin it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>centrifuge and extract the medium chain </v>

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:06.450
<v Speaker 1>triglyceride oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pete Holmes,</v>

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:08.350
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mct oils.</v>

4
00:00:08.351 --> 00:00:09.184
<v Speaker 1>This is what's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's been asking me why we've </v>

5
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.483
<v Speaker 1>never done one another's podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we have an absurd amount of </v>

6
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>things in common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I was watching some starlet like in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer's room the other day,</v>

8
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>starlit I started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember her.</v>

9
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Never have used that word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from the 30th.</v>

10
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that I was just flipping a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nickel under a streetlamp before the kid</v>

11
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:27.924
<v Speaker 1>may have a toothpick in your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we were watching some startling on </v>

12
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:34.040
<v Speaker 1>letterman and he was just one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>great letterman clips,</v>

13
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.883
<v Speaker 1>so it was really just being a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff you don't really see anymore </v>

14
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.183
<v Speaker 1>and I loved it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was making fun of the star lit </v>

15
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.720
<v Speaker 1>because she ate clay and all I was doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>was googling edible cla.</v>

16
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a believer.</v>

17
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm one of those guys that fucks up</v>

18
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>medical studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

19
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Like they give me the pussy and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

20
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was amazing.</v>

21
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.500
<v Speaker 1>My vision was sharp for four hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.750
<v Speaker 1>what is eating clay do for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

23
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing is if she had letterman</v>

24
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:04.440
<v Speaker 1>was giving her all this shit and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do it,</v>

25
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 1>but I could defend it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

26
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 1>if you ate poison and you went to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular western medical doctor that give</v>

27
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>you charcoal activated charcoal is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same idea.</v>

28
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>These earthy type of things draw out </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy metals and poisons from your body.</v>

29
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>That's not to say that I'm going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and eat a clay,</v>

30
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>but every morning in my smoothie there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shit ton of,</v>

31
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w we can swear,</v>

32
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

33
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

34
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:25.704
<v Speaker 1>Ton of Alaris wondered if we could </v>
<v Speaker 1>switch a professional comedian and </v>

35
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>youtube too much television fellow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well fuck balls go a shit ton.</v>

37
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:39.174
<v Speaker 1>I'm swearing about how much Cilantro I </v>
<v Speaker 1>put in my smoothies because Elantra </v>

38
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Parsley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these do the same type of thing.</v>

39
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know Rhonda Patrick?</v>

40
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But regardless,</v>

41
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>having some sort of an effect of pulling</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy metals or attaches itself to heavy</v>

42
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:51.384
<v Speaker 1>metals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it her might have been so many </v>

43
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.813
<v Speaker 1>believers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're putting activate or whatever </v>

44
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:56.870
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

45
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>all is is healthy fats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

46
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 1>This is super simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for your brain.</v>

47
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.553
<v Speaker 1>It's a medium chain triglyceride oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's the healthiest aspects of </v>

48
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 1>coconut oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

49
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Just get some healthy fats in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Are you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do coconut oil as well?</v>

51
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of coconut oil and those </v>

52
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.360
<v Speaker 1>forks over knives guys.</v>

53
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen them lately knowing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're off oil,</v>

54
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>they look like they're about to blow </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

55
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:24.570
<v Speaker 1>They're dying in front of our faces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so hardcore now.</v>

56
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>I liked that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those guys didn't see that one.</v>

57
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's about the China </v>
<v Speaker 1>study.</v>

58
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.350
<v Speaker 1>The China study has been debunked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that thing?</v>

59
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.343
<v Speaker 1>Who tried to scientists getting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire Breitbart news staff know the </v>

60
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.750
<v Speaker 1>China Study Alternative facts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately they didn't.</v>

61
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used some studies.</v>

62
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.073
<v Speaker 1>They use confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These some studies that correlate all </v>

63
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.060
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent legit scientists.</v>

64
00:02:57.661 --> 00:02:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Even vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists who have debunked it.</v>

65
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at it and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

67
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>here's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't bring up this.</v>

68
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>They didn't bring up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That couldn't have been perfect.</v>

69
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:07.444
<v Speaker 1>It was just a bunch of Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie and pull something up on it </v>

70
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>because there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been some pretty good scientific</v>

71
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>analysis of it.</v>

72
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.243
<v Speaker 1>Analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CCS does that word hypothesis's that </v>

73
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>sounds like a wrong word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Analysis is.</v>

74
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like the plural of thesis theses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sounds too much like feces.</v>

75
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things you never say </v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

76
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Can we go rest in peace?</v>
<v Speaker 1>China study.</v>

77
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Chris Kresser did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who that is.</v>

78
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.900
<v Speaker 1>He's brilliant because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

79
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>you spent on my podcast for two and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a macrobiotic.</v>

80
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I make fun of Chris Kessler and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

81
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm just doing a general but he gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked with online,</v>

82
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>but one of the reasons why he gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked with his,</v>

83
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:44.944
<v Speaker 1>because he was a hardcore Vegan and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was having some pretty significant </v>

84
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>health issues and then slowly but surely</v>
<v Speaker 1>switched over.</v>

85
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

86
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

87
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.653
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things like some </v>

88
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>people can eat that Vegan Diet and love </v>
<v Speaker 1>great and be fine and healthy.</v>

89
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.670
<v Speaker 1>It makes me feel I'm a.</v>

90
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm a flagging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

91
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Fish occasionally eat fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fish is great.</v>

92
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 1>I occasionally get drunk and eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>roscoe's chicken and waffles.</v>

93
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 1>The thing is I don't want to be militant</v>
<v Speaker 1>or stringent about anything.</v>

94
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:10.474
<v Speaker 1>It's just like kind of another thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have in common is consciousness </v>

95
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>and all that sort of stuff and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like being rigid about meditating.</v>

96
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't like being rigid about any sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of practice,</v>

97
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:19.594
<v Speaker 1>including veganism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I tweeted a or I instagrammed a </v>

98
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 1>photo of me at shake shack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a meme that said two drinks,</v>

99
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>not Vegan and I look so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

100
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:30.514
<v Speaker 1>I look like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look like a meal and the feet of like </v>

101
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.020
<v Speaker 1>a double shack burger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was unbelievable.</v>

102
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Double murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

103
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really funny because I mocked </v>

104
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:42.994
<v Speaker 1>vegans all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this whole bit about vegans in my </v>

105
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:45.064
<v Speaker 1>act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you will catch me at a Vegan </v>

106
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 1>restaurant at least four days a week.</v>

107
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 1>But you know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if Aaron Rodgers is a,</v>

108
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 1>not a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a pal of mine,</v>

109
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.720
<v Speaker 1>all those nfl guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this.</v>

110
00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to tell you anything you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know about athletes.</v>

111
00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:58.803
<v Speaker 1>They're all eating plant based and meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they eat clean protein and they </v>

112
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just do the plants.</v>

113
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:06.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the murder and I don't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it makes me feel.</v>

114
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:06.964
<v Speaker 1>Frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like putting things in my body that </v>

115
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:11.740
<v Speaker 1>are readily absorbed and I said this on </v>
<v Speaker 1>my podcast.</v>

116
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what you think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say you can eat a steak for protein.</v>

117
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm very curious what you're gonna say </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that because I bet you're going to</v>

118
00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 1>school me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say you can't eat a steak for protein.</v>

119
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like drinking coke for </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

120
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:22.054
<v Speaker 1>It's in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to do a lot of digesting </v>

121
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:24.904
<v Speaker 1>and grinding and extracting to get it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to something that you might </v>

122
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>blend and get into your cells more </v>
<v Speaker 1>readily.</v>

123
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you blend food for sure,</v>

124
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:34.300
<v Speaker 1>it gets in your cells more readily so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could blend the steak.</v>

125
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that,</v>

126
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.303
<v Speaker 1>but I mean if you blend like vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much easier for your body to </v>

127
00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:40.780
<v Speaker 1>process like a smoothie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like God damn,</v>

128
00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I drank these Kale smoothies and they go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through me like rocket.</v>

129
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>And you mean it gives you the shits or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

130
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shits.</v>

131
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.533
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shits doesn't get me die unless you </v>

132
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:51.544
<v Speaker 1>drink too much mct oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something I should bring up </v>

133
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 1>because it has come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take too much mct is it</v>

134
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 2>ultra lubes you up inside?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your body's like,</v>

135
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 2>well that a huge cargo loads they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been holding onto just your childhood.</v>

136
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Like one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

137
00:06:06.421 --> 00:06:11.421
<v Speaker 2>logging boats tips over very fast river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what I see.</v>

138
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 2>I liked that you brought that up is I </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat Vegan to get high.</v>

139
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm doing to get high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you eat three live,</v>

140
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 2>like blue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>green algae,</v>

141
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 2>that's going to ask you about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really,</v>

142
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.023
<v Speaker 2>really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do have vegan food and that's </v>

143
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:27.340
<v Speaker 2>something that Chris Kresser brings up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12.</v>

144
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Super important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

145
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.913
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to get with strict </v>

146
00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:35.420
<v Speaker 2>superintendent for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in the dirt on the dirt.</v>

147
00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:36.254
<v Speaker 2>It used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd get it that way and now I take it </v>

148
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 2>gets you high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can you take that?</v>

149
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.863
<v Speaker 2>There's this product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should have brought you something </v>

150
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:43.270
<v Speaker 2>called the High Huh?</v>

151
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

152
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 2>just feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like clean,</v>

153
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 2>like just like a river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're moving.</v>

154
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that has to do with like </v>
<v Speaker 2>your placebo effect idea to that?</v>

155
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:53.640
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm doing good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating healthy.</v>

156
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.493
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That I could not shake shack burger but </v>

157
00:06:57.021 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 2>I've done it the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not a Vegan for 35,</v>

158
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 2>36 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have the data both ways.</v>

159
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 2>Well it sounds like you're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>

160
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.150
<v Speaker 2>If you're using e three live and every </v>
<v Speaker 2>once in awhile you'll be like,</v>

161
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need some fucking Sushi.</v>

162
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:11.804
<v Speaker 2>I eat Sushi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mi or would you be willing to eat eggs </v>

163
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.810
<v Speaker 2>from a chicken that you knew lived in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a yard?</v>

164
00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:20.420
<v Speaker 2>Like something that's like healthy where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there's no suffering.</v>

165
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.313
<v Speaker 2>I can dig that and I just want to beefs </v>
<v Speaker 2>I have with Peta is that they have this </v>

166
00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:28.690
<v Speaker 2>campaign against eggs with Peter Peter </v>
<v Speaker 2>with not.</v>

167
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.673
<v Speaker 2>Well I do and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like Peter has actually retweeted my </v>

168
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:34.940
<v Speaker 2>stuff a bunch of times because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

169
00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:35.774
<v Speaker 2>really against dolphin captivity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>really against Orca captivity and I say </v>

170
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:42.110
<v Speaker 2>I think it's slavery that we tolerate in</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017.</v>

171
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:42.944
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's anything other than </v>

172
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:44.714
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those things are arguably as </v>

173
00:07:46.821 --> 00:07:47.654
<v Speaker 2>intelligent as people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just can't communicate the way we </v>

174
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Speaker 2>can and they don't have hands that </v>
<v Speaker 2>committed pilate objects and create art.</v>

175
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.500
<v Speaker 2>We have a hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a bit about this.</v>

176
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Why do we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about dolphins,</v>

177
00:07:56.361 --> 00:07:57.530
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do we eat pigs,</v>

178
00:07:57.531 --> 00:07:59.810
<v Speaker 2>but we don't eat dogs and I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 2>hooves.</v>

179
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.090
<v Speaker 2>The evil feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

180
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:04.723
<v Speaker 2>Dog with hooves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now picture everyone applauding because </v>

181
00:08:06.951 --> 00:08:10.410
<v Speaker 2>I dropped kicked that monster onto a lit</v>
<v Speaker 2>grill demon.</v>

182
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 2>A cloven hooves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't need its own chewing cud.</v>

183
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

184
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.893
<v Speaker 2>What if you saw a pig with pause point </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you saw a dolphin with hands or </v>

185
00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 2>checking the Khatak no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

186
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.853
<v Speaker 2>chickens are dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chickens are fucking ruthless little </v>

187
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.320
<v Speaker 2>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So say that.</v>

188
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fed my chickens mice before.</v>

189
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 2>I have 23 chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do not?</v>

190
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

191
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.260
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get all my.</v>

192
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.310
<v Speaker 2>I ate five eggs this morning from my </v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens.</v>

193
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

194
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.270
<v Speaker 2>they're like pets though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I go out in the yard.</v>

195
00:08:38.271 --> 00:08:40.610
<v Speaker 2>They're like pets to give me food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any attachment to them.</v>

196
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Do you like your chicken?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

197
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.080
<v Speaker 2>my chickens died and my favorite one got</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed by a coyote.</v>

198
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.760
<v Speaker 2>That was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coyote running ran over the phone.</v>

199
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.910
<v Speaker 2>I saw it jump over that chicken chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mouth.</v>

200
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan is after God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

201
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Then I found that the coyote was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother coyote that had babies nearby and</v>

202
00:08:57.961 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 2>I felt bad.</v>

203
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.910
<v Speaker 2>I was going to kill her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

204
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.753
<v Speaker 2>I was going to set it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to leave some food behind </v>

205
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:06.150
<v Speaker 2>and sniper from the roof though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

206
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:08.350
<v Speaker 2>I just felt like she's just doing what </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's going to do.</v>

207
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.253
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you something funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met with one of the women that like </v>

208
00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 2>founded cafe gratitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously Vegan restaurant,</v>

209
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.940
<v Speaker 2>the Vegan restaurant that's deeply under</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire.</v>

210
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:19.250
<v Speaker 2>You know the whole story behind them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

211
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

212
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.230
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>

213
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 2>They started eating meat again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who did cafe gratitude.</v>

214
00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:24.954
<v Speaker 2>The people own it really on a ranch and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they started eating meat again and they </v>

215
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:29.604
<v Speaker 2>started talking about it and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>received death threats and people were </v>

216
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.890
<v Speaker 2>protesting and boycotting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant.</v>

217
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:35.993
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were terrified that they were </v>

218
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:38.100
<v Speaker 2>terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

219
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:38.934
<v Speaker 2>this is why you got to be a fleeting as </v>
<v Speaker 2>long as you don't stand anywhere to </v>

220
00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:43.194
<v Speaker 2>pescatarian.</v>

221
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 2>Segun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Segun?</v>

222
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because pescatarian means you eat dairy </v>

223
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 2>because I don't fuck with daring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pescatarian means dairy.</v>

224
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pescatarian.</v>

225
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.070
<v Speaker 2>I thought pescatarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fish.</v>

226
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.410
<v Speaker 2>It's vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegetarian.</v>

227
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.470
<v Speaker 2>That means that she's Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fish,</v>

228
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 2>seagate and seagate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of these are catchy.</v>

229
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:03.300
<v Speaker 2>You have to just say league and which </v>
<v Speaker 2>means you can't touch me,</v>

230
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 2>but she told me when I met with her as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutritionalist,</v>

231

<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

251
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.150
<v Speaker 2>if you're not gonna do it if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegan.</v>

252
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:48.984
<v Speaker 2>But she was like the perfect thing to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an e three in the morning and one </v>

253
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:52.530
<v Speaker 2>egg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

254
00:10:52.531 --> 00:10:54.990
<v Speaker 2>you should eat one egg every day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this was good for you.</v>

255
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.850
<v Speaker 2>Clearly there's stuff going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amino acid wise and cholesterol.</v>

256
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.330
<v Speaker 2>Cholesterol is important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People you.</v>

257
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the study that came out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

258
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.420
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

259
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.720
<v Speaker 2>in the New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not a study rather.</v>

260
00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:12.880
<v Speaker 2>But because I want to make fun of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

261
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.413
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't expos in the New York Times </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how the sugar industry paid off </v>

262
00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:22.971
<v Speaker 2>scientists in 19 fifties to demonize </v>
<v Speaker 2>saturated fats and take the blame off of</v>

263
00:11:23.941 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 2>sugar and for like a really absurdly low</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of money,</v>

264
00:11:28.141 --> 00:11:30.520
<v Speaker 2>like $50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were saying,</v>

265
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.460
<v Speaker 2>not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll kill you money.</v>

266
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

267
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.333
<v Speaker 2>For $50,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys essentially changed the way </v>

268
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:42.690
<v Speaker 2>with this bogus study changed the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>people think about sugar.</v>

269
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Which sugar sugar should be goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying.</v>

270
00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:45.904
<v Speaker 2>I know it's horrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you watch a food choices is a good </v>

271
00:11:49.741 --> 00:11:50.940
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's fat up.</v>

272
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:52.710
<v Speaker 2>There's that sugar film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sugar film.</v>

273
00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:54.880
<v Speaker 2>There's a of really good dance where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just like,</v>

274
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had Gary Tobbs in two weeks ago.</v>

275
00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:59.560
<v Speaker 2>He's the author of the case against </v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar.</v>

276
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Tubbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No different guy.</v>

277
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.440
<v Speaker 2>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I think of a joke,</v>

278
00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:06.274
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to science journalist and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a great book called the case </v>

279
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:11.430
<v Speaker 2>against sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but apparently he's controversial too.</v>

280
00:12:11.431 --> 00:12:14.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a bunch of people are mad at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mad at everybody.</v>

281
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.960
<v Speaker 2>These are big lobbyists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going after like cocaine.</v>

282
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 2>It's not that it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other scientists disagree with him.</v>

283
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Other nutritionalist nutritionists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make them nice to you.</v>

284
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry you put words in my brain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoked dope.</v>

285
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Of course I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't I?</v>

286
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:34.610
<v Speaker 2>It's Sunday or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what there was.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the end.</v>

292
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:44.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So this cafe gratitude people.</v>

311
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.003
<v Speaker 2>They decided somewhere along the line </v>
<v Speaker 2>what was really weird because they </v>

312
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:38.380
<v Speaker 2>connected it to Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

313
00:13:38.381 --> 00:13:39.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

314
00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:44.251
<v Speaker 2>they had this statement that they made </v>
<v Speaker 2>their jesusy they don't do cheeses,</v>

315
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.330
<v Speaker 2>but they'll do Jesus while they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>older.</v>

316
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel in Anita left for that.</v>

317
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't do cheeses,</v>

318
00:13:49.661 --> 00:13:51.940
<v Speaker 2>but they'll do Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to give you a laugh.</v>

319
00:13:51.941 --> 00:13:53.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's A.</v>

320
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he must've not heard.</v>

321
00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:57.490
<v Speaker 2>That's a Tony Hinchcliffe style on human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

322
00:13:57.491 --> 00:13:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Don't like jokes that computers would </v>
<v Speaker 2>get it.</v>

323
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.560
<v Speaker 2>Granted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

324
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.880
<v Speaker 2>I liked them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>

325
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.540
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

326
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.870
<v Speaker 2>It didn't get me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

327
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.591
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

328
00:14:05.591 --> 00:14:08.270
<v Speaker 2>it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might have laughed.</v>

329
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.353
<v Speaker 2>I like that you're honest there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus was going to say is I think this </v>

330
00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:15.784
<v Speaker 2>happens to a lot of people to get older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start thinking that it benefits </v>

331
00:14:20.081 --> 00:14:23.290
<v Speaker 2>them to have some sort of potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>deity in the future.</v>

332
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.680
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

333
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.533
<v Speaker 2>I think they think of the future and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they think of heaven and they think of </v>

334
00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Jesus and God and all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the numbers on that.</v>

335
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:30.903
<v Speaker 2>Like the conversion of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>become like serious Catholics when </v>

336
00:14:33.071 --> 00:14:33.904
<v Speaker 2>they're 70 might not even be Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might go to an alternative sort of </v>

337
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.730
<v Speaker 2>church or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just some sort of a worship place.</v>

338
00:14:40.731 --> 00:14:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Cc the door and you'd like a friend on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other side.</v>

339
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

340
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.703
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think gratitude is incredibly </v>

341
00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:50.500
<v Speaker 2>important and I think like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciation is incredibly important and</v>

342
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:51.853
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that helps people feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>gratitude and appreciation is a sense </v>

343
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:58.250
<v Speaker 2>that there's something out there bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>than you and you sort of submit to that.</v>

344
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.870
<v Speaker 2>And I think when people get older and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their health starts slowly deteriorating</v>

345
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:04.490
<v Speaker 2>and it's inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

346
00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:05.373
<v Speaker 2>I mean as much as I'm 49 and as much as </v>
<v Speaker 2>I exercise and try to take care of </v>

347
00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:13.070
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely feel like it's harder.</v>

348
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.490
<v Speaker 2>It's harder to maintain a certain level </v>
<v Speaker 2>of fitness and health.</v>

349
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:17.660
<v Speaker 2>It isn't as you get older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

350
00:15:17.661 --> 00:15:21.080
<v Speaker 2>and it can have an excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just soft to you.</v>

351
00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Can you have an excuse?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're Vegan.</v>

352
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tougher.</v>

353
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.561
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

354
00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:26.810
<v Speaker 2>You've had some of those super fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegans.</v>

355
00:15:26.811 --> 00:15:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Rich Roll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

356
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.150
<v Speaker 2>You had them on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

357
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:31.210
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it fit his very fit.</v>

358
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Different kind of fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just running for long periods of time.</v>

359
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.050
<v Speaker 2>It's not really no explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's trying to kick your ass.</v>

360
00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot millions,</v>

361
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.123
<v Speaker 2>but my point is that I think that folks </v>
<v Speaker 2>as they get older and they feel their </v>

362
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.920
<v Speaker 2>their health slipping and they feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that they really</v>

363
00:15:51.921 --> 00:15:55.400
<v Speaker 2>upped their workload as they get older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I talked to Bobcat goldthwait about</v>

364
00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:57.530
<v Speaker 2>that and Henry rollins is the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

365
00:15:57.531 --> 00:15:58.364
<v Speaker 2>he feels like death at the door and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>feels like he's got to be more </v>

366
00:16:00.891 --> 00:16:01.310
<v Speaker 2>productive.</v>

367
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.410
<v Speaker 2>We've got to get things done before he </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes.</v>

368
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.810
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could go the other way for sure.</v>

369
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:07.970
<v Speaker 2>You could go more of a Buddhist </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened be like death is coming.</v>

370
00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Why was I so lost in this game?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

371
00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.530
<v Speaker 2>The toasted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I drink a green juice,</v>

372
00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:15.530
<v Speaker 2>I've said this on my own podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to toast it and go,</v>

373
00:16:15.531 --> 00:16:17.540
<v Speaker 2>it won't save.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

374
00:16:17.541 --> 00:16:19.970
<v Speaker 2>But it was something beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people,</v>

375
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:20.804
<v Speaker 2>when they're nearing death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Rom Dass has a great quote where he's </v>

376
00:16:23.391 --> 00:16:24.224
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people do the most profound </v>

377
00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:25.844
<v Speaker 2>spiritual work of their lives in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last five minutes they're on earth </v>

378
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.300
<v Speaker 2>because they get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're surrounded by everybody stuck and</v>

379
00:16:32.301 --> 00:16:36.000
<v Speaker 2>lost in the drama of this is important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Joe Rogan,</v>

380
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.863
<v Speaker 2>he called me an asshole on twitter or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is and where there were </v>

381
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:40.710
<v Speaker 2>suffocating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

382
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:41.540
<v Speaker 2>and then they're free.</v>

383
00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.620
<v Speaker 2>People that just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

384
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.690
<v Speaker 2>it was just a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a dance,</v>

385
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.220
<v Speaker 2>it was a play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a dance.</v>

386
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.830
<v Speaker 2>It's an experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean we can't play it.</v>

387
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.023
<v Speaker 2>I think like creative people for some </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason feel towards the end that maybe </v>

388
00:16:54.051 --> 00:16:56.530
<v Speaker 2>they haven't done their best work yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

389
00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.240
<v Speaker 2>and it's funny that this book is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting here randomly,</v>

390
00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:02.210
<v Speaker 2>but this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the war of art is a title.</v>

391
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.530
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever read it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

392
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Please take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a bunch of.</v>

393
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:07.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to leave here to the runner up</v>
<v Speaker 2>on double dare.</v>

394
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Steven Pressfield's book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

395
00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the.</v>

396
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.070
<v Speaker 2>That signed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them is signed,</v>

397
00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.263
<v Speaker 2>signed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leave it.</v>

398
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I got one for sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

399
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Leave that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

400
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.130
<v Speaker 2>I'll get you one step of art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

401
00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:22.310
<v Speaker 2>I bought stacks of them and I give them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to people and press go on the podcast.</v>

402
00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:23.144
<v Speaker 2>That's where this one is signed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all about resistance and about </v>

403
00:17:27.021 --> 00:17:27.854
<v Speaker 2>how it's very difficult for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes to just get things done </v>

404
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.190
<v Speaker 2>because they put things off and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>procrastinate and they.</v>

405
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.033
<v Speaker 2>There's this weird thing that artists do</v>
<v Speaker 2>wear a lot of times they half ass stuff </v>

406
00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.260
<v Speaker 2>and it's almost like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

407
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.650
<v Speaker 2>the pressure of creating something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of expressing yourself,</v>

408
00:17:43.651 --> 00:17:46.670
<v Speaker 2>of doing something that you really feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>proud of really good.</v>

409
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.280
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's overwhelming to a lot of people and</v>

410
00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.800
<v Speaker 3>I think for creative folks as they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>older,</v>

411
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.850
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they feel like there's no time left.</v>

412
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's time to get going.</v>

413
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.120
<v Speaker 3>Liz Gilbert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in her book,</v>

414
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.133
<v Speaker 3>big magic talks about how it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a collective unconscious </v>

415
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:05.523
<v Speaker 3>getting the tank gentle and there's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas and we're almost like fishermen </v>

416
00:18:08.911 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 3>for ideas and something that I find </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivating.</v>

417
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.353
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm trying to write a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to do all these things and </v>

418
00:18:13.591 --> 00:18:14.424
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to reel in that fish before </v>

419
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.070
<v Speaker 3>someone else that's quieter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More tuned into that.</v>

420
00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:22.020
<v Speaker 3>Unconscious is gonna is gonna get to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>

421
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:24.090
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like an urgency.</v>

422
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.013
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting because in an idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then like five years later someone </v>

423
00:18:27.391 --> 00:18:32.340
<v Speaker 3>else has something very similar and I an</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea or a concept similar kind of missed</v>

424
00:18:32.341 --> 00:18:33.570
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>

425
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:35.100
<v Speaker 3>that's not something I dwell on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>

426
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.840
<v Speaker 3>but I do see it.</v>

427
00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.313
<v Speaker 3>The other thing you made me think of is </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tarantino before he wrote pulp fiction </v>

428
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:42.630
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't die.</v>

429
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:43.560
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>

430
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.393
<v Speaker 3>I had a fearlessness where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was on like a bumpy plane and he was </v>

431
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:47.730
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to die.</v>

432
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:48.683
<v Speaker 3>I haven't finished pulp fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he joked when he finished both </v>

433
00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:52.740
<v Speaker 3>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like shit.</v>

434
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:53.574
<v Speaker 3>Now he became very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very nervous that he had kind of like </v>

435
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.880
<v Speaker 3>fulfilled his destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

436
00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.720
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's ego mania.</v>

437
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.880
<v Speaker 3>Gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you think there is something.</v>

438
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:07.583
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever get in manic states when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're writing or creating where you're </v>

439
00:19:11.041 --> 00:19:13.710
<v Speaker 3>just kind of like burning clean white </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy?</v>

440
00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:14.610
<v Speaker 3>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

441
00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:16.250
<v Speaker 3>this is just kind of coming through me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

442
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.580
<v Speaker 3>Well at the moment I start realizing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the moment it goes away.</v>

443
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:21.893
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that a lesson?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I was gonna say to you </v>

444
00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:24.360
<v Speaker 3>that I bet you would like.</v>

445
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:25.523
<v Speaker 3>I remember being very little and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>being so much more interested than my </v>

446
00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:31.800
<v Speaker 3>other little friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At what happens when you close your eyes</v>

447
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.050
<v Speaker 3>and when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're laying down at night.</v>

448
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.143
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a lot of people aren't doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people that I asked about it </v>

449
00:19:37.681 --> 00:19:41.250
<v Speaker 3>aren't doing the kind of work of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you seeing?</v>

450
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.113
<v Speaker 3>What does it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mckenna Terence Mckenna talks about our </v>

451
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:45.594
<v Speaker 3>dreams are probably far more interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>than we ever even realize you're </v>

452
00:19:48.331 --> 00:19:51.360
<v Speaker 3>remembered and if you're closing your </v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes as you're falling asleep and you're</v>

453
00:19:51.361 --> 00:19:53.670
<v Speaker 3>paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you see something amazing.</v>

454
00:19:53.671 --> 00:19:56.970
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember one time I was feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was on the bottom of a rocket and</v>

455
00:19:56.971 --> 00:19:57.804
<v Speaker 3>I just saw the exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this amazing rocket taking me to outer </v>

456
00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:01.074
<v Speaker 3>space and it was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was pristine and as soon as I tried </v>

457
00:20:03.511 --> 00:20:06.030
<v Speaker 3>to hold onto it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes away just like that.</v>

458
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:06.923
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happens to a lot of people when </v>

459
00:20:07.951 --> 00:20:09.720
<v Speaker 3>they experienced lucid dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

460
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you experience lucid dreams,</v>

461
00:20:11.671 --> 00:20:12.720
<v Speaker 3>like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're awake,</v>

462
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.610
<v Speaker 3>awake in the dream and then you realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

463
00:20:14.611 --> 00:20:15.444
<v Speaker 3>but apparently it's amazing that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't done anything to try to </v>

464
00:20:18.001 --> 00:20:18.834
<v Speaker 3>cultivate this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently it can be cultivated and </v>

465
00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:22.254
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people out there who do</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience lucid dreams and can manage </v>

466
00:20:24.841 --> 00:20:25.620
<v Speaker 3>that dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yoga,</v>

467
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big lucid dreamers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you?</v>

468
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.003
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the reasons I saw a video </v>

469
00:20:28.921 --> 00:20:29.754
<v Speaker 3>where you talked about Alpha brand </v>
<v Speaker 3>helping with lucid dream ticket late at </v>

470
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:33.683
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always have these fucking trippy </v>

471
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.473
<v Speaker 3>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like last night I took Alpha brain </v>

472
00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:39.410
<v Speaker 3>before worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

473
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.730
<v Speaker 3>so it was a few hours before I went to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep,</v>

474
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:42.953
<v Speaker 3>but I still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still had some really bizarre dreams </v>

475
00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:48.700
<v Speaker 3>as it's making its way through my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wasted time.</v>

476
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.980
<v Speaker 3>I think there is a parallel to be drawn.</v>

477
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.730
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about the drama of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you have a lucid dream,</v>

478
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:58.840
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something very in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ballpark of enlightenment going on.</v>

479
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:01.030
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like a play version of </v>
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment.</v>

480
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.570
<v Speaker 3>Enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why enlightened?</v>

481
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.140
<v Speaker 3>Because I'll have a dream that I'm back </v>
<v Speaker 3>in high school.</v>

482
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:08.150
<v Speaker 3>The classic dream and there's the test </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a,</v>

483
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.070
<v Speaker 3>it's a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scared,</v>

484
00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:09.904
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared and it's always like some </v>

485
00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:14.200
<v Speaker 3>history of math class and I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 3>around this very realistic.</v>

486
00:21:14.201 --> 00:21:15.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm in my high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

487
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.033
<v Speaker 3>the geography is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people are correct and it's so </v>

488
00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:20.530
<v Speaker 3>realistic that I'm not just panicking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually,</v>

489
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:21.483
<v Speaker 3>the dream is long enough that I'm asking</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to borrow their notes so I can </v>

490
00:21:25.241 --> 00:21:29.830
<v Speaker 3>cram and then there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>techniques you can do to cultivate lucid</v>

491
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:30.664
<v Speaker 3>dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them I do all the time as I look </v>

492
00:21:31.571 --> 00:21:32.290
<v Speaker 3>at my hands.</v>

493
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:35.080
<v Speaker 3>Anytime in waking life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if something surreal happens,</v>

494
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.660
<v Speaker 3>you look at your hands because if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at your hands in a dream,</v>

495
00:21:37.661 --> 00:21:39.550
<v Speaker 3>they always look wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

496
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.403
<v Speaker 3>it's a giveaway that you're dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll do something probably look in </v>

497
00:21:43.421 --> 00:21:45.160
<v Speaker 3>your dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look inflated.</v>

498
00:21:45.161 --> 00:21:47.680
<v Speaker 3>They look like those sports fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what Mickey Mouse hands.</v>

499
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.553
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For some reason your subconscious can </v>

500
00:21:50.261 --> 00:21:51.880
<v Speaker 3>create a beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

501
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:52.714
<v Speaker 3>NASA rocket taking off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your hands it can't do really turns </v>

502
00:21:55.541 --> 00:21:56.374
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know the back of your hand </v>

503
00:21:56.681 --> 00:21:57.514
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

504
00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.913
<v Speaker 3>And then this thing right here is </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually kind of trippy because this is </v>

505
00:22:00.941 --> 00:22:03.160
<v Speaker 3>what clocks look like in dreams because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's left brain,</v>

506
00:22:03.161 --> 00:22:04.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about this,</v>

507
00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who makes out again,</v>

508
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.620
<v Speaker 3>what does team one made it to the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube clock?</v>

509
00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.450
<v Speaker 3>What is the name of the studio?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought it was wrong clock.</v>

510
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.261
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

511
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:15.094
<v Speaker 3>This guy is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does it all by hands and he by his </v>

512
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.190
<v Speaker 3>hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does it all by hand.</v>

513
00:22:21.191 --> 00:22:24.850
<v Speaker 3>Everything including the walnut case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tg tgt studio,</v>

514
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.020
<v Speaker 3>tgt studios.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You order them.</v>

515
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:28.960
<v Speaker 3>He does a car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cuts the walnut,</v>

516
00:22:28.961 --> 00:22:32.200
<v Speaker 3>and he uses those things inside of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come from Russia.</v>

517
00:22:32.201 --> 00:22:33.880
<v Speaker 3>They're very difficult to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they called?</v>

518
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.103
<v Speaker 3>Nick's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nick's youtube.</v>

519
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:40.410
<v Speaker 3>What is the next to you right there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had the whole answer.</v>

520
00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

521
00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:45.040
<v Speaker 3>but when you're in the tubes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any clock will look like that.</v>

522
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.053
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's the wrong side of your </v>

523
00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:47.740
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

524
00:22:47.741 --> 00:22:49.840
<v Speaker 3>Any clock will look like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy looks amazing.</v>

525
00:22:49.841 --> 00:22:52.180
<v Speaker 3>I might mix these up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll look wrong.</v>

526
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.490
<v Speaker 3>It'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be 17:00,</v>

527
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.250
<v Speaker 3>it'll be 17,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the symbol for infinity.</v>

528
00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.293
<v Speaker 3>And then ideally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the clocks will be fucked up too </v>

529
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:02.440
<v Speaker 3>because the left side of your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might get these left,</v>

530
00:23:02.441 --> 00:23:02.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

531
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.633
<v Speaker 3>Confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the left side of your brain is what </v>

532
00:23:04.541 --> 00:23:06.310
<v Speaker 3>streaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the right side of your brain is what</v>

533
00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:07.144
<v Speaker 3>controls language and writing are so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So another clue is if you pick up a </v>

534
00:23:09.911 --> 00:23:12.070
<v Speaker 3>newspaper and notes and it just looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Jibberish,</v>

535
00:23:12.071 --> 00:23:15.370
<v Speaker 3>that's a that you're dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whichever technique it is,</v>

536
00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm having that horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very real,</v>

537
00:23:17.531 --> 00:23:19.630
<v Speaker 3>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>High school nightmare.</v>

538
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:23.590
<v Speaker 3>And then you remember that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>dreaming and you're still there,</v>

539
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.110
<v Speaker 3>but you're liberated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberated,</v>

540
00:23:26.111 --> 00:23:27.940
<v Speaker 3>silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no test.</v>

541
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.970
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a little taste of enlightenment I</v>

542
00:23:30.971 --> 00:23:32.560
<v Speaker 3>think as you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

543
00:23:32.561 --> 00:23:35.410
<v Speaker 3>I was lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in that dream so hard.</v>

544
00:23:35.411 --> 00:23:37.030
<v Speaker 3>And then you went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no test.</v>

545
00:23:37.031 --> 00:23:39.490
<v Speaker 3>And then you fly to Milan and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>sex with Kate Upton.</v>

546
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.590
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you realize upton,</v>

547
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.590
<v Speaker 3>she's beautiful model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember her.</v>

548
00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's the one</v>

549
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.370
<v Speaker 2>with the really big breasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got kind of heavy.</v>

550
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:51.380
<v Speaker 2>You got to kind of heavy and people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>mad.</v>

551
00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.990
<v Speaker 2>It's just took a strange left turn for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kate Upton.</v>

552
00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was also,</v>

553
00:23:56.181 --> 00:23:57.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

554
00:23:57.651 --> 00:23:58.590
<v Speaker 2>that's her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

555
00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.433
<v Speaker 2>You know what's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whenever I'm in my podcast form on </v>

556
00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:02.954
<v Speaker 2>my website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever people would be bored with the </v>

557
00:24:03.981 --> 00:24:04.814
<v Speaker 2>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will start putting up pictures of </v>

558
00:24:05.691 --> 00:24:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Kate Upton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It became a meme or a theme.</v>

559
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.920
<v Speaker 2>She came to a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a show with jed and.</v>

560
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.650
<v Speaker 2>And you met Leslie Mann.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nervous.</v>

561
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Look right at her and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

562
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just heard the door.</v>

563
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So birds are amazing that through no </v>

564
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.680
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She did just just random genetic luck.</v>

565
00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.593
<v Speaker 2>She has become like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what your voice sounds </v>

566
00:24:32.811 --> 00:24:34.040
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know a damn thing about her,</v>

567
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:35.910
<v Speaker 2>but she's pretty much perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

568
00:24:35.911 --> 00:24:36.744
<v Speaker 2>she's very pretty.</v>

569
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Some people think she's fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why Do,</v>

570
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.410
<v Speaker 2>if she gained weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably would just like her more.</v>

571
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you feel like she's human.</v>

572
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.190
<v Speaker 2>Soft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soft.</v>

573
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.670
<v Speaker 2>I like to like the world to be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of Tarantino,</v>

574
00:24:49.671 --> 00:24:51.380
<v Speaker 2>there's a great line in pulp fiction </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it goes.</v>

575
00:24:51.381 --> 00:24:54.080
<v Speaker 2>It's a shame that the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasing to the touch aren't pleasing to</v>

576
00:24:54.081 --> 00:24:55.730
<v Speaker 2>the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're a hard man.</v>

577
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.950
<v Speaker 2>I bet it's more fun to hug me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No offense.</v>

578
00:24:57.951 --> 00:24:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Please don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't let.</v>

579
00:24:58.971 --> 00:25:00.980
<v Speaker 2>It just depends on what you're into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

580
00:25:00.981 --> 00:25:02.980
<v Speaker 2>but you look way better than I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's.</v>

581
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for how you look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should feel like me.</v>

582
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.810
<v Speaker 2>It should be like I'm a tempurpedic </v>
<v Speaker 2>mattress.</v>

583
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are not hard to sleep on a slab.</v>

584
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Harder bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

585
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sleep on a pretty dense bed.</v>

586
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.250
<v Speaker 2>That's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

587
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:22.790
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your sleep number is.</v>

588
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.713
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I sleep because I don't know what </v>

589
00:25:25.221 --> 00:25:25.761
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

590
00:25:25.761 --> 00:25:27.590
<v Speaker 2>but whenever I sleep on a really soft </v>
<v Speaker 2>bed,</v>

591
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.713
<v Speaker 2>get like a crick in my neck or my back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Felt like a sink in too much or </v>

592
00:25:30.861 --> 00:25:31.970
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

593
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a tempurpedic.</v>

594
00:25:33.501 --> 00:25:35.220
<v Speaker 2>I am the tempurpedic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

595
00:25:35.221 --> 00:25:38.900
<v Speaker 2>you can get tempurpedic beds that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>more dense I think.</v>

596
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.850
<v Speaker 2>I think they did come and various </v>
<v Speaker 2>density.</v>

597
00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:42.720
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a from one.</v>

598
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.500
<v Speaker 2>So anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

599
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.480
<v Speaker 2>she's a tempurpedic bed like beanbag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call them thicker,</v>

600
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:52.550
<v Speaker 2>thicker milkshakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like thicker,</v>

601
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.160
<v Speaker 2>thicker milkshakes too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But women.</v>

602
00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

603
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:58.023
<v Speaker 2>My milkshake brings all the boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you attracted to women that are as </v>

604
00:26:01.041 --> 00:26:02.690
<v Speaker 2>fit as you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

605
00:26:02.691 --> 00:26:05.780
<v Speaker 2>I like women to take care of their body </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think that they have more of a</v>

606
00:26:05.781 --> 00:26:07.730
<v Speaker 2>body awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're sexier.</v>

607
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.751
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

608
00:26:08.751 --> 00:26:10.820
<v Speaker 2>so you draw an intellectual comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>

609
00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:12.950
<v Speaker 2>you have abs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore you know the science.</v>

610
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:14.323
<v Speaker 2>They have abs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people who move their body a </v>

611
00:26:16.161 --> 00:26:17.780
<v Speaker 2>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people who do yoga,</v>

612
00:26:17.781 --> 00:26:20.930
<v Speaker 2>people do gymnastics or martial arts or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

613
00:26:20.931 --> 00:26:25.931
<v Speaker 2>I think they're more aware of their body</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're communicating with in an</v>

614
00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.870
<v Speaker 2>intense way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really.</v>

615
00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:28.743
<v Speaker 2>Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

616
00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:32.420
<v Speaker 2>If you do yoga like all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're communicating with your body in a</v>

617
00:26:32.421 --> 00:26:37.421
<v Speaker 2>super intense way on a regular basis and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'll just be less awkward,</v>

618
00:26:37.821 --> 00:26:40.790
<v Speaker 2>more confident or more sensual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

619
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.290
<v Speaker 2>I completely agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

620
00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:44.430
<v Speaker 2>and it helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga helps you breathe.</v>

621
00:26:44.431 --> 00:26:46.500
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I did a lot of yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy was like,</v>

622
00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:47.334
<v Speaker 2>you'll notice that yogis always brief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stay calmer because they know what </v>

623
00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:52.490
<v Speaker 2>it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's another staffer.</v>

624
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.630
<v Speaker 2>It's another death thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like meditation.</v>

625
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.493
<v Speaker 2>You're asked to supposed to hurt when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're meditating because you're trying </v>

626
00:26:57.691 --> 00:26:59.640
<v Speaker 2>to extricate your consciousness from </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

627
00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.740
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're sitting down.</v>

628
00:27:01.741 --> 00:27:06.170
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is pain as part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of yoga or meditating and of Yoga.</v>

629
00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say their pain.</v>

630
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.403
<v Speaker 2>There's pain and yoga and I'm over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only reason why I disagree </v>

631
00:27:14.881 --> 00:27:15.714
<v Speaker 2>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My best meditation by far is in a </v>

632
00:27:17.971 --> 00:27:20.160
<v Speaker 2>sensory deprivation tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which not only another thing.</v>

633
00:27:20.161 --> 00:27:22.800
<v Speaker 2>We haven't gotten no pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels amazing.</v>

634
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't call that.</v>

635
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Do you meditate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you?</v>

636
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I breathe.</v>

637
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.713
<v Speaker 2>My meditation is all concentrating on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the breath deep in through the nose and </v>

638
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:35.904
<v Speaker 2>out through the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take these really long breaths where </v>

639
00:27:38.221 --> 00:27:40.260
<v Speaker 2>I'll breathe in for like almost a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>

640
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.333
<v Speaker 2>Then I breathe out for almost a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're very difficult to do </v>

641
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.580
<v Speaker 2>oxygenating your blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

642
00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:50.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's that or if I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm controlling myself.</v>

643
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:54.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm exercising my personal control </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you want to just bring.</v>

644
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.340
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you take,</v>

645
00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:01.350
<v Speaker 2>try to take a long breath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm one minute breath in.</v>

646
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.400
<v Speaker 2>It takes a lot of effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

647
00:28:03.401 --> 00:28:04.234
<v Speaker 2>I'll for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to hold it and then breathe out </v>

648
00:28:06.421 --> 00:28:09.750
<v Speaker 2>slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's kind of my point is monks in</v>

649
00:28:09.751 --> 00:28:12.780
<v Speaker 2>the mountains or you in the tank or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

650
00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:13.643
<v Speaker 2>People doing yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something bad ass about it is </v>

651
00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:17.490
<v Speaker 2>because you're doing something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like.</v>

652
00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.470
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought monks were relaxing.</v>

653
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just.</v>

654
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:24.030
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't take the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are too many TV channels they went</v>

655
00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:26.370
<v Speaker 2>up into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those dudes are tripping out and they're</v>

656
00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:27.204
<v Speaker 2>denying the pain of their body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just exactly what you do when you push </v>

657
00:28:29.971 --> 00:28:31.390
<v Speaker 2>through a workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend of mine,</v>

658
00:28:31.391 --> 00:28:32.700
<v Speaker 2>he became a monk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

659
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a regular dude.</v>

660
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Dunkin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No different guy.</v>

661
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.833
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't communicated with them in a </v>

662
00:28:37.561 --> 00:28:40.440
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's not a,</v>

663
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:41.443
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he might be just completely off </v>

664
00:28:42.601 --> 00:28:44.580
<v Speaker 2>the grid now because he dove in </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardcore.</v>

665
00:28:44.581 --> 00:28:45.414
<v Speaker 2>I was probably like 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 years old and he was a guy that he </v>

666
00:28:48.261 --> 00:28:50.050
<v Speaker 2>used to train with and my taekwondo </v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

667
00:28:50.051 --> 00:28:51.450
<v Speaker 2>his name was Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Smith,</v>

668
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:53.663
<v Speaker 2>last name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't make us trying to remember his </v>

669
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:57.960
<v Speaker 2>last name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

670
00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.020
<v Speaker 2>he's a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but an interesting guy,</v>

671
00:29:01.021 --> 00:29:01.854
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

672
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:03.443
<v Speaker 2>He was just like cool black dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he started meditating because he </v>

673
00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:09.870
<v Speaker 2>would get real nervous before sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

674
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:11.070
<v Speaker 2>Inspiring me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm real nervous,</v>

675
00:29:11.071 --> 00:29:11.904
<v Speaker 2>so he started to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>maximize his physical ability and </v>

676
00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.930
<v Speaker 2>potential and he figured controlling his</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind would be the best way.</v>

677
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.003
<v Speaker 2>So he got involved in meditation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then he sought out lessons at this </v>

678
00:29:22.711 --> 00:29:23.544
<v Speaker 2>Buddhist temple and he started </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditating there and he got super </v>

679
00:29:25.951 --> 00:29:30.951
<v Speaker 2>serious and then he quit his fucking job</v>
<v Speaker 2>and moved out of his apartment and lived</v>

680
00:29:31.291 --> 00:29:35.460
<v Speaker 2>in the temple and just cleaned up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>his food and he became a vegetarian,</v>

681
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.400
<v Speaker 2>very strict vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would eat just vegetables and rice,</v>

682
00:29:38.401 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 2>that's all lost a shit ton of weight and</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially stopped training</v>

683
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.023
<v Speaker 1>altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop fighting and competing and doing </v>

684
00:29:44.231 --> 00:29:49.231
<v Speaker 1>anything like that and just would </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditate and giving up your life to gain</v>

685
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:50.860
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a Jesus thing and you know,</v>

686
00:29:50.861 --> 00:29:53.500
<v Speaker 1>like a Zen Koan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the sound of one hand clapping,</v>

687
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.140
<v Speaker 1>like you meditate on that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no answer to that.</v>

688
00:29:56.141 --> 00:29:58.780
<v Speaker 1>And he had a really weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a really weird one.</v>

689
00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.793
<v Speaker 1>Something about a dog barking is how do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your Buddha nature through the </v>

690
00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:06.340
<v Speaker 1>sound of a cricket and and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be like,</v>

691
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:07.060
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

692
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:07.893
<v Speaker 1>well the crackhead is may and I'm the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cricket and they're just like taken </v>

693
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:12.910
<v Speaker 1>stare in the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

694
00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:13.744
<v Speaker 1>That's pain too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all this like we know in our </v>

695
00:30:15.941 --> 00:30:19.990
<v Speaker 1>life that suffering leads to growth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it leads to like a cleansing.</v>

696
00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had all these things and I think these</v>

697
00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.313
<v Speaker 1>turned on guys figure out that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacture a type of suffering instead </v>

698
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:29.890
<v Speaker 1>of waiting for it from the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is going to come.</v>

699
00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:30.813
<v Speaker 1>Inevitably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go and sit on a hard ass floor </v>

700
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.420
<v Speaker 1>or you can restrict your diet or you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathe in for a fucking minute.</v>

701
00:30:37.421 --> 00:30:41.320
<v Speaker 1>You're causing suffering because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know on the other side of it,</v>

702
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:43.810
<v Speaker 1>that's where blesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where wisdom is.</v>

703
00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:44.644
<v Speaker 1>All these good things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the understanding that a lot </v>

704
00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.393
<v Speaker 1>of your desperate need to breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just your brain fucking with you </v>

705
00:30:52.271 --> 00:30:54.850
<v Speaker 1>and you're gonna be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take this denial of the body,</v>

706
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:56.183
<v Speaker 1>like when I've been free diving and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a beautiful thing when you're </v>

707
00:30:58.331 --> 00:30:59.920
<v Speaker 1>low and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

708
00:30:59.921 --> 00:31:02.380
<v Speaker 1>you panic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my friend who was teaching me,</v>

709
00:31:02.381 --> 00:31:03.214
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he calls it second breath where if you </v>

710
00:31:04.751 --> 00:31:08.050
<v Speaker 1>relax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize it's your brain fucking with</v>

711
00:31:08.051 --> 00:31:08.884
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your brain is like a woody allen </v>

712
00:31:09.731 --> 00:31:10.720
<v Speaker 1>character and he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

713
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.450
<v Speaker 1>we better get up right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

714
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:14.563
<v Speaker 1>I need you to go shut up woodrow and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize you had way more oxygen and you </v>

715
00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.013
<v Speaker 1>relaxed and that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it gets this reputation as </v>

716
00:31:22.601 --> 00:31:26.620
<v Speaker 1>being kind of like a soft or maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a feminine kind of meditation.</v>

717
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Yoga not so much now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly.</v>

718
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:30.783
<v Speaker 1>My father doesn't think it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has definitely a feminine reputation </v>

719
00:31:36.191 --> 00:31:37.024
<v Speaker 1>or weak reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is insane because it's one of the </v>

720
00:31:38.591 --> 00:31:40.870
<v Speaker 1>most difficult things I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lift weights,</v>

721
00:31:40.871 --> 00:31:43.180
<v Speaker 1>I do martial arts and do all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things and I swear to God,</v>

722
00:31:43.181 --> 00:31:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Yoga is as difficult if not more </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult than all of them.</v>

723
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:46.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

724
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.943
<v Speaker 1>And I'll say you'd probably wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you look like you're way a good </v>

725
00:31:49.901 --> 00:31:50.510
<v Speaker 1>amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

726
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.040
<v Speaker 1>around 200 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere on there.</v>

727
00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:52.993
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to throw you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're using 200 pounds and </v>

728
00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.370
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your resistance,</v>

729
00:31:57.371 --> 00:31:58.630
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be difficult.</v>

730
00:31:58.690 --> 00:31:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Throw me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

731
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:00.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

732
00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:01.683
<v Speaker 1>I think I would hurt my back if I were </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to try to heat the martial arts </v>

733
00:32:04.541 --> 00:32:05.374
<v Speaker 1>stuff is the ball pit or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing like a friendly scenario </v>

734
00:32:07.721 --> 00:32:09.900
<v Speaker 1>where you go please keep me like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dwarf.</v>

735
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to throw me how you got from</v>

736
00:32:13.991 --> 00:32:14.824
<v Speaker 1>Yoga?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throwing people away enough that I </v>

737
00:32:17.291 --> 00:32:20.860
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't want to throw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at someone and go,</v>

738
00:32:20.861 --> 00:32:23.260
<v Speaker 1>I like to troll you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like have a small fella.</v>

739
00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.750
<v Speaker 1>This is what folks do is we look around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>

740
00:32:25.751 --> 00:32:29.710
<v Speaker 1>who in in an order from one to 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who in this room would I tossed first?</v>

741
00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Who could I throw the furthest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would throw Jamie first,</v>

742
00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:34.083
<v Speaker 1>but for me like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's moments in yoga class where I </v>

743
00:32:37.151 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 1>swear I'm tested as much as anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever in my</v>

744
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.010
<v Speaker 2>life right now where you're holding a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pose and it's,</v>

745
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can keep holding it,</v>

746
00:32:45.231 --> 00:32:47.890
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to stop and you're,</v>

747
00:32:47.891 --> 00:32:52.520
<v Speaker 2>you're whole body is shaking and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally see the sweat pouring off your</v>

748
00:32:52.521 --> 00:32:55.160
<v Speaker 2>face and falling off your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially hot yoga.</v>

750
00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally mean if I do cool yoga,</v>

751
00:33:02.091 --> 00:33:02.924
<v Speaker 2>I'm still the guy with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to put out the special towels and </v>

752
00:33:04.701 --> 00:33:05.820
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

753
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:06.703
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen people do yoga on like </v>

754
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.030
<v Speaker 2>hardwood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shiny floors and you know,</v>

755
00:33:11.031 --> 00:33:13.430
<v Speaker 2>like in or start sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're slipping all over the place.</v>

756
00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:15.440
<v Speaker 2>That just doesn't seem smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

757
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:16.600
<v Speaker 2>that's dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very,</v>

758
00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:17.870
<v Speaker 2>very dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

759
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.140
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get the respect it deserves,</v>

760
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.670
<v Speaker 2>but I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

761
00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

762
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.720
<v Speaker 2>there's so many douchebags involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

763
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:27.980
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the problem.</v>

764
00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys ruined everything.</v>

765
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:34.580
<v Speaker 2>They do body sprays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to wear a Bluetooth earpiece.</v>

766
00:33:34.581 --> 00:33:35.414
<v Speaker 2>It sometimes I gave up on them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave up on them when I saw how gross </v>

767
00:33:40.221 --> 00:33:41.054
<v Speaker 2>it looks from people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because you could be </v>

768
00:33:42.711 --> 00:33:43.544
<v Speaker 2>having a meeting on a phone rather a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation as long as there's a cord </v>

769
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:49.070
<v Speaker 2>that goes into your ear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

770
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:50.420
<v Speaker 2>I would be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>

772
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.950
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're standing there talking and</v>

773
00:33:54.951 --> 00:33:56.840
<v Speaker 2>you're moving your hands around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got an earpiece and I'm like,</v>

782
00:34:14.871 --> 00:34:15.800

<v Speaker 2>I wish people,</v>

795
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.380

<v Speaker 2>cars that don't make any noise.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The dinosaurs aren't good enough for </v>

<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although fossil fuel wasn't really dead </v>

804
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.190
<v Speaker 2>things rotten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

805
00:35:01.191 --> 00:35:02.024
<v Speaker 2>but there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a book called black gold </v>

806
00:35:03.381 --> 00:35:06.410
<v Speaker 2>stranglehold that I read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so confusing because I was like,</v>

807
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.500
<v Speaker 2>I want to say like at least 15 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

808
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:10.813
<v Speaker 2>But the books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the premise of the book was that what </v>

809
00:35:13.791 --> 00:35:18.650
<v Speaker 2>we've been hoodwinked and that the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that oil is a finite resource,</v>

810
00:35:18.651 --> 00:35:19.484
<v Speaker 2>it's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually a natural process of </v>

811
00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:22.430
<v Speaker 2>the earth itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

812
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.273
<v Speaker 2>it'll keep making it a repeating process</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that wells that have been dry have </v>

813
00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.900
<v Speaker 2>rebounded when left alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

814
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's true though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would never looked into it again.</v>

815
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:34.280
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We looked at,</v>

816
00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:35.840
<v Speaker 2>maybe we talked about it once during the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

817
00:35:35.841 --> 00:35:36.800
<v Speaker 2>but we were probably high</v>

818
00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.340
<v Speaker 1>scatterbrained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a great experience in a float tank</v>

819
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.380
<v Speaker 1>the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it maybe four.</v>

820
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have one,</v>

821
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:46.180
<v Speaker 1>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basement.</v>

822
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.520
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool.</v>

823
00:35:47.521 --> 00:35:49.870
<v Speaker 1>I went to a place called just float and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first one,</v>

824
00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:51.090
<v Speaker 1>the one in Pasadena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

825
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.620
<v Speaker 1>That's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the biggest place in the world.</v>

826
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.780
<v Speaker 1>The Best Company for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest.</v>

827
00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.240
<v Speaker 1>They have more float tanks I think than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone in the world.</v>

828
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:58.103
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing because they're doing the </v>

829
00:35:58.711 --> 00:35:59.491
<v Speaker 1>first one that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

830
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:00.324
<v Speaker 1>this is like a spa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've been to the one in Venice at </v>

831
00:36:01.531 --> 00:36:03.490
<v Speaker 1>some guy in flip flops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my boy crash.</v>

832
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:04.930
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

833
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.600
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of built my tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the best.</v>

834
00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the float lab.</v>

835
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get over the fact that he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna come get me.</v>

836
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the best night to worry about.</v>

837
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Crashing in the tank was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long have I been in here?</v>

838
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.233
<v Speaker 1>Whose name is a sound effect is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>knock on the door and it's gonna scare </v>

839
00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:24.360
<v Speaker 1>the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It totally ruined it at just float.</v>

840
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Maybe crash does this now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It plays music at Lowe's.</v>

841
00:36:27.361 --> 00:36:29.280
<v Speaker 1>You out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys like to do that.</v>

842
00:36:29.281 --> 00:36:30.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a good move and it's like a pizza </v>
<v Speaker 1>oven.</v>

843
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:35.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like a door in the wall and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>crawl in and I had a pretty.</v>

844
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:36.384
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to go like leave my body </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he ever talk about astral </v>

845
00:36:39.631 --> 00:36:40.980
<v Speaker 1>projection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well no,</v>

846
00:36:40.981 --> 00:36:41.814
<v Speaker 1>but I know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was spending most of it being like it </v>

847
00:36:43.441 --> 00:36:44.274
<v Speaker 1>would be so trippy if I just went and </v>
<v Speaker 1>visited my girlfriend right now I </v>

848
00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.300
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I did it,</v>

849
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.493
<v Speaker 1>but I definitely didn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember having this very clear </v>

850
00:36:54.601 --> 00:36:55.434
<v Speaker 1>thought where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted to try a sensory </v>

851
00:36:57.661 --> 00:36:59.760
<v Speaker 1>deprivation tank and I was in it.</v>

852
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.150
<v Speaker 1>So it was somewhere else completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>unaware that I was in it and then I like</v>

853
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:06.540
<v Speaker 1>jolted back into let's just say my </v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness.</v>

854
00:37:06.541 --> 00:37:09.990
<v Speaker 1>I was lost in my mind so deep that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgot where I was.</v>

855
00:37:09.991 --> 00:37:12.150
<v Speaker 1>I forgot who I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very relaxing.</v>

856
00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

857
00:37:13.381 --> 00:37:16.590
<v Speaker 1>And it's also something that the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>England patriots use on a regular basis.</v>

858
00:37:16.591 --> 00:37:17.424
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really believe the falcons want used </v>

859
00:37:19.711 --> 00:37:21.060
<v Speaker 1>it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put the goat in there.</v>

860
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:24.810
<v Speaker 1>They use it for all their players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use it for visualization.</v>

861
00:37:24.811 --> 00:37:25.644
<v Speaker 1>They usually for recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really great source of magnesium </v>

862
00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:29.190
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the EPSOM salts,</v>

863
00:37:29.191 --> 00:37:30.900
<v Speaker 1>it absorbs through your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

864
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Do they change the water?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

865
00:37:32.761 --> 00:37:33.630
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

866
00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:37.920
<v Speaker 1>And they also filter it out like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>float lab as a really intense filtration</v>

867
00:37:37.921 --> 00:37:38.754
<v Speaker 1>system which uses ozone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use these gigantic spa filters and </v>

868
00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.253
<v Speaker 1>ozone and like to the point where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed everything that might be in that </v>

869
00:37:47.881 --> 00:37:48.714
<v Speaker 1>water except step to you except come </v>
<v Speaker 1>except coming for sure beats off in the </v>

870
00:37:51.751 --> 00:37:51.930
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

871
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:53.460
<v Speaker 1>So a friend that went in one and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

872
00:37:53.461 --> 00:37:54.294
<v Speaker 1>I had to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just let it go when you want to spend </v>

873
00:37:56.551 --> 00:37:59.100
<v Speaker 1>an hour in your own piss and then as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole,</v>

874
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:00.930
<v Speaker 1>what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gratuity.</v>

875
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.720
<v Speaker 1>That's an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a real asshole move.</v>

876
00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:08.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that people are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified of those things.</v>

877
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Hot tubs and swimming pools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're ruining the communal.</v>

878
00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:13.824
<v Speaker 1>It's like when I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to have this vat of Coleslaw </v>

879
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.040
<v Speaker 1>that was free and I was such a hungry </v>
<v Speaker 1>boy that I would love the Coleslaw.</v>

880
00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Then you find out that jocks are </v>
<v Speaker 1>spitting in it like that.</v>

881
00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:28.780
<v Speaker 1>That's whole ruin everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ruin yoga.</v>

882
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

883
00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Earpieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bluetooth,</v>

884
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 1>veganism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that's why I don't want to</v>

885
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.320
<v Speaker 2>be a two associated with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

886
00:38:38.321 --> 00:38:40.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull up the article and that,</v>

888
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.660

<v Speaker 2>Gratitude at the article came out in May</v>

889
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.111
<v Speaker 2>of last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so six,</v>

890

891
00:38:53.951 --> 00:38:54.784
<v Speaker 2>2015.</v>

<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they were getting a bunch of shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>wooden handle of a sign and she swung at</v>

920
00:40:08.831 --> 00:40:09.664

<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious because he's a gay Jew.</v>

926
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Milo Yiannopoulos was Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her doing it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is not the video that I saw.</v>

929
00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:41.800
<v Speaker 2>I saw it from a different angle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they take her,</v>

930
00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:46.120
<v Speaker 2>she gets pepper sprayed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they showing it?</v>

931
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:48.940
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might.</v>

932
00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

933
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.170
<v Speaker 2>That looks right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just gets pepper sprayed,</v>

934
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.000
<v Speaker 2>like cc it towards the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

935
00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Somebody just pepper sprayed her just </v>
<v Speaker 2>just because she's wearing that hat,</v>

936
00:40:58.210 --> 00:40:59.410
<v Speaker 2>which is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

937
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:00.543
<v Speaker 2>that's a fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just walks up to her and pepper sprays </v>

938
00:41:02.401 --> 00:41:04.090
<v Speaker 2>or in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

939
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.133
<v Speaker 2>The idea that you think you could do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just because you don't agree with </v>

940
00:41:07.151 --> 00:41:07.990
<v Speaker 2>that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thoughts.</v>

941
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:13.180
<v Speaker 2>You can choose violence because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't agree with that person's thoughts.</v>

942
00:41:13.181 --> 00:41:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Instead of having a civil debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not.</v>

943
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:17.980
<v Speaker 2>She's not as threatening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was not physical.</v>

944
00:41:17.981 --> 00:41:21.610
<v Speaker 2>She's not doing anything violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're missing a mythic hero.</v>

945
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.593
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people want Bernie Sanders to </v>

946
00:41:23.411 --> 00:41:24.244
<v Speaker 2>be that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have a Martin Luther King </v>

947
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:28.330
<v Speaker 2>that's telling us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

948
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.770
<v Speaker 2>only love can drive out hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only light can draw darkness.</v>

949
00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 2>So you ended up with a</v>

950
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.843
<v Speaker 4>lot of people that don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>narrative or a story or a or something </v>

951
00:41:37.221 --> 00:41:38.054
<v Speaker 4>in common,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you just have people kind of </v>

952
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:41.263
<v Speaker 4>running it however they see fit and some</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are stupid and they're going to </v>

953
00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:44.000
<v Speaker 4>pepper spray paint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

954
00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:45.800
<v Speaker 4>there's also this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this her getting,</v>

955
00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:49.510
<v Speaker 4>this is another angle of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>paid for it.</v>

956
00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:56.150
<v Speaker 4>So she's got this hat on in a free </v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

957
00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:59.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's fucking insane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

958
00:41:59.901 --> 00:42:01.850
<v Speaker 4>That someone could just walk right up to</v>
<v Speaker 4>her and pepper.</v>

959
00:42:01.851 --> 00:42:02.684
<v Speaker 4>Spray her in the face just because she's</v>
<v Speaker 4>wearing a hat that supports Donald </v>

960
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.950
<v Speaker 4>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

961
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:08.960
<v Speaker 4>if you want to talk to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you talk to them if you don't agree with</v>

962
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:10.310
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a conversation with them.</v>

963
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:14.020
<v Speaker 4>But there's this narrative that's going </v>
<v Speaker 4>around and it's punch Nazis,</v>

964
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.740
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People keep saying that so.</v>

965
00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:17.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck is a Nazi?</v>

966
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:18.590
<v Speaker 4>Who Do you determine as a Nazi?</v>

967
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:20.360
<v Speaker 4>You decide they're a Nazi and then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>punch them,</v>

968
00:42:20.361 --> 00:42:21.194
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have evidence of this person's a </v>

969
00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:23.270
<v Speaker 4>Nazi?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you.</v>

970
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:23.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you,</v>

971
00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.940
<v Speaker 4>do you see them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they have a Nazi flag on them?</v>

972
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:28.640
<v Speaker 4>Are they saying Sieg Heil?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they have a copy of mine comp?</v>

973
00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.313
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just decide wearing the halloween </v>

974
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.170
<v Speaker 4>costume.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's how it goes.</v>

975
00:42:33.171 --> 00:42:35.870
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thought process is if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want it to fall like on a flow chart,</v>

976
00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.140
<v Speaker 4>it's like decide someone's a Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can punch them,</v>

977
00:42:39.141 --> 00:42:40.760
<v Speaker 4>punch Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>find someone.</v>

978
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.350
<v Speaker 4>Are they a Nazi?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say yes.</v>

979
00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.970
<v Speaker 4>Punch them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so there's this.</v>

980
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.160
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of people like </v>
<v Speaker 4>respectable,</v>

981
00:42:46.161 --> 00:42:50.150
<v Speaker 4>intelligent people that are just plain </v>
<v Speaker 4>upset that trump is the president.</v>

982
00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:53.570
<v Speaker 4>Just plain upset that in their eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think rightly so.</v>

983
00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:57.200
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of assholes that support </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump and there's a lot of assholes that</v>

984
00:42:57.201 --> 00:42:59.150
<v Speaker 4>are now gloating and they didn't know.</v>

985
00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:00.230
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grow up,</v>

986
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.610
<v Speaker 4>you lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We won.</v>

987
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:02.563
<v Speaker 4>There's all this going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and their response to it is now those </v>

988
00:43:04.881 --> 00:43:05.714
<v Speaker 4>people are Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go Punch Nazis and these really </v>

989
00:43:08.331 --> 00:43:10.760
<v Speaker 4>impressionable people are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Punch them.</v>

990
00:43:10.761 --> 00:43:11.594
<v Speaker 4>Do you see jake shields,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the former UFC fighters in mma fighter </v>

991
00:43:14.241 --> 00:43:15.074
<v Speaker 4>is a good friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had to save some kid who was getting </v>

992
00:43:18.021 --> 00:43:21.800
<v Speaker 4>beaten up by a whole group of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>just because he was a trump supporter.</v>

993
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:22.753
<v Speaker 4>He didn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was just there at this thing and </v>

994
00:43:25.101 --> 00:43:28.180
<v Speaker 4>there's a few people that were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

995
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:29.203
<v Speaker 4>trump supporters or Milo yiannopoulos </v>
<v Speaker 4>supporters and the rest of them were </v>

996
00:43:31.821 --> 00:43:34.460
<v Speaker 4>people that were mad that Milo was </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing there.</v>

997
00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:35.643
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so controversial and so fucked up </v>

998
00:43:38.481 --> 00:43:41.900
<v Speaker 4>and so wrong because the left is now </v>
<v Speaker 4>becoming the right.</v>

999
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:46.320
<v Speaker 4>Like you're becoming a fascist by saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a one stop fast.</v>

1000
00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.430
<v Speaker 4>It's like a weird twists in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1001
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:49.580
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the.</v>

1002
00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:50.443
<v Speaker 4>There's a kabir quote where he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do what you have to do with another </v>

1003
00:43:52.161 --> 00:43:53.960
<v Speaker 4>person but never put them out of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart.</v>

1004
00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:56.420
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's a great way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember.</v>

1005
00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.350
<v Speaker 4>I was with rammed us with Duncan in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii and he said,</v>

1006
00:44:00.351 --> 00:44:03.530
<v Speaker 4>I hate Donald Trump here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not here.</v>

1007
00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.720
<v Speaker 4>He pointed to his head and it's not as </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard.</v>

1008
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:06.613
<v Speaker 4>And then the thing that I love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this has been a mantra for me for </v>

1009
00:44:09.651 --> 00:44:11.300
<v Speaker 4>ever since I've heard it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's been about a year,</v>

1010
00:44:11.301 --> 00:44:12.134
<v Speaker 4>but it's very applicable now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think is that hate is a lack of </v>

1011
00:44:14.691 --> 00:44:15.524
<v Speaker 4>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you see somebody wearing a hat </v>

1012
00:44:18.231 --> 00:44:19.064
<v Speaker 4>and then you make all these assumptions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're not taking the time to </v>

1013
00:44:21.771 --> 00:44:22.604
<v Speaker 4>consider.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe this person was raised different </v>

1014
00:44:24.381 --> 00:44:26.120
<v Speaker 4>from me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe this person is scared of this,</v>

1015
00:44:26.121 --> 00:44:28.160
<v Speaker 4>this or this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they had medical issues.</v>

1016
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:29.173
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this great David Foster Wallace </v>

1017
00:44:30.471 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 4>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Were you in that great</v>

1018
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.800
<v Speaker 1>graduation speech he gave called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is water?</v>

1019
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1020
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:37.373
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he talks about when you see an suv </v>

1021
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:43.860
<v Speaker 1>on the highway and you just assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some like piece of shit changing</v>

1022
00:44:43.861 --> 00:44:45.510
<v Speaker 1>lanes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking burning gas,</v>

1023
00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:49.520
<v Speaker 1>taken up the world like a real kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a shorts and a grid out guy that's,</v>

1024
00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:52.040
<v Speaker 1>that's a dick and taking more than he </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserves it.</v>

1025
00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:54.000
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lack of imagination.</v>

1026
00:44:54.001 --> 00:44:54.834
<v Speaker 1>If you consider that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's a mother who was in a </v>

1027
00:44:57.061 --> 00:45:02.061
<v Speaker 1>terrible car accident that was all but </v>
<v Speaker 1>prescribed to drive a big vehicle so she</v>

1028
00:45:02.101 --> 00:45:03.000
<v Speaker 1>would feel safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>

1029
00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:04.043
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm talking about when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see someone wearing a hat and you just </v>

1030
00:45:06.511 --> 00:45:07.740
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a Nazi.</v>

1031
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:08.574
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to punch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not taking the time to not just </v>

1032
00:45:10.261 --> 00:45:13.110
<v Speaker 1>have empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually compassion and realize that</v>

1033
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:14.280
<v Speaker 1>we're all in this together.</v>

1034
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I remember after after trump won in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>green room of a comedy show that we.</v>

1035
00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.353
<v Speaker 1>I did a show the next day and somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>was having like a full blown panic and </v>

1036
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.290
<v Speaker 1>rage and talking about how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorists,</v>

1037
00:45:25.291 --> 00:45:26.124
<v Speaker 1>we're going to test him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the terrorists are going to test </v>

1038
00:45:27.811 --> 00:45:28.620
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to,</v>

1039
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:29.453
<v Speaker 1>they're going to do this and this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really panicking and it really kind of </v>

1040
00:45:31.951 --> 00:45:33.330
<v Speaker 1>gave me a little bit of perspective on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1041
00:45:33.331 --> 00:45:34.680
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Hillary had won,</v>

1042
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:36.263
<v Speaker 1>we not us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other people who are just like us </v>

1043
00:45:38.671 --> 00:45:39.504
<v Speaker 1>would be somewhere else in some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy club and some other greenroom </v>

1044
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.100
<v Speaker 1>complaining about how the terrorists are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to test hillary.</v>

1045
00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.660
<v Speaker 1>She's weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a woman.</v>

1046
00:45:45.661 --> 00:45:47.520
<v Speaker 1>They're going to test her and it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>made me realize,</v>

1047
00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.740
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all in this together.</v>

1048
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.470
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond empathy into compassion.</v>

1049
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:55.500
<v Speaker 1>When I see someone in a red hat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1050
00:45:55.501 --> 00:45:58.110
<v Speaker 1>there's my brother and my sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different life,</v>

1051
00:45:58.111 --> 00:45:59.880
<v Speaker 1>a different path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing a different part,</v>

1052
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.390
<v Speaker 1>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all part of one body and pepper.</v>

1053
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Spraying that body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just spraying yourself.</v>

1054
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I understand rage and and protests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1055
00:46:10.291 --> 00:46:12.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

1056
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:14.520
<v Speaker 1>but violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're hurting ourselves.</v>

1057
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:15.543
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right about a lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity or a lack of imagination and </v>

1058
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:22.080
<v Speaker 1>being able to look at that person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1059
00:46:22.081 --> 00:46:22.914
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did that person get to that point </v>

1060
00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:26.220
<v Speaker 1>and what went wrong in their life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>why are they here?</v>

1061
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1062
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:28.710
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1063
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

1064
00:46:30.331 --> 00:46:35.331
<v Speaker 1>whether a pepper spraying somebody or </v>
<v Speaker 1>protesting against something or you,</v>

1065
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.950
<v Speaker 1>whenever you have a cause and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>two sides,</v>

1066
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.870
<v Speaker 1>people are going to jump on one side or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>

1067
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:42.120
<v Speaker 1>It's just natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People want to be in a tribe.</v>

1068
00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:46.230
<v Speaker 1>They want to be on a team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you set up the narrative and it</v>

1069
00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.290
<v Speaker 1>really dangerous narrative that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of fools,</v>

1070
00:46:49.291 --> 00:46:51.930
<v Speaker 1>people in there to sutter evil people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other side of the you,</v>

1071
00:46:51.931 --> 00:46:52.764
<v Speaker 1>you set up these two camps and these two</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different sides and it </v>

1072
00:46:57.451 --> 00:46:58.284
<v Speaker 1>becomes a black white issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it becomes a red state blue state </v>

1073
00:47:00.691 --> 00:47:02.580
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what you're seeing here.</v>

1074
00:47:02.581 --> 00:47:07.140
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are tribal because it is us.</v>

1075
00:47:07.141 --> 00:47:07.974
<v Speaker 1>As soon as we come and ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become with them what or had isn't </v>

1076
00:47:10.171 --> 00:47:13.170
<v Speaker 1>even a trump hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says may make bitcoin great again.</v>

1077
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a big one hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

1078
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.660
<v Speaker 1>What if I was suddenly so that guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>pepper sprayed her and he thought it was</v>

1079
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:21.360
<v Speaker 1>a make America great again hat Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Christ.</v>

1080
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just assholes.</v>

1081
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:26.700
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

1082
00:47:26.701 --> 00:47:29.680
<v Speaker 1>most of them are wearing face masks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're covered in.</v>

1083
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 1>There's</v>

1084
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:35.160
<v Speaker 4>a mob mentality that is a very real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's whatever condition,</v>

1085
00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:37.870
<v Speaker 4>whatever it causes it in the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>psyche.</v>

1086
00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:38.943
<v Speaker 4>But something happens where there's this</v>
<v Speaker 4>diffusion of responsibility when people </v>

1087
00:47:41.591 --> 00:47:42.424
<v Speaker 4>act in large groups that allows people </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do really heinous things and it's </v>

1088
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:46.690
<v Speaker 4>been studied,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1089
00:47:46.691 --> 00:47:47.524
<v Speaker 4>there's been psychological studies drawn</v>
<v Speaker 4>on it or done on it and it's really </v>

1090
00:47:50.771 --> 00:47:53.950
<v Speaker 4>confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know that poll,</v>

1091
00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:54.813
<v Speaker 4>everybody if you ever been in a riot </v>
<v Speaker 4>type situation or in a group situation </v>

1092
00:47:58.241 --> 00:47:59.830
<v Speaker 4>where there's a lot of people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>something goes wrong.</v>

1093
00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:01.273
<v Speaker 4>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a weird feeling that happens </v>

1094
00:48:03.821 --> 00:48:04.654
<v Speaker 4>when a large group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was on the subway going downtown to </v>

1095
00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:08.284
<v Speaker 4>the women's March and it was getting so </v>
<v Speaker 4>packed that people were starting to </v>

1096
00:48:11.381 --> 00:48:13.730
<v Speaker 4>panic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A kid threw up and stuff and I was going</v>

1097
00:48:13.731 --> 00:48:17.920
<v Speaker 4>to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forgot what it feels like to be with a</v>

1098
00:48:17.921 --> 00:48:20.740
<v Speaker 4>lot of us when we start getting scared.</v>

1099
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:21.933
<v Speaker 4>But that's the beginning of imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the beginning of coming up with </v>

1100
00:48:25.481 --> 00:48:26.314
<v Speaker 4>some sort of game plan for compassion </v>
<v Speaker 4>when we can sit down and have a </v>

1101
00:48:29.921 --> 00:48:30.754
<v Speaker 4>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying don't make signs and </v>

1102
00:48:32.711 --> 00:48:34.930
<v Speaker 4>don't raise your voice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I am definitely saying,</v>

1103
00:48:34.931 --> 00:48:39.460
<v Speaker 4>don't pepper spray somebody that's in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this world with you.</v>

1104
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.920
<v Speaker 4>That's like trying to figure it out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>best they can.</v>

1105
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:42.813
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1106
00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.400
<v Speaker 4>this don't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't raise your voice.</v>

1107
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:48.190
<v Speaker 4>It's always a good thing to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1108
00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:49.053
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what's wrong with these discussions </v>

1109
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:51.873
<v Speaker 4>with the Milo Yiannopoulos thing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to stop him from </v>

1110
00:48:54.101 --> 00:48:54.934
<v Speaker 4>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to get your point across </v>

1111
00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.380
<v Speaker 4>schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>debate,</v>

1112
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:00.333
<v Speaker 4>he'd be more than happy to debate you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and do it in a respectful manner where </v>

1113
00:49:03.431 --> 00:49:06.970
<v Speaker 4>you can try to pick apart his points.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had milo on my podcast,</v>

1114
00:49:06.971 --> 00:49:07.804
<v Speaker 4>I've picked apart his points,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had him on and we've gone back and </v>

1115
00:49:10.361 --> 00:49:15.060
<v Speaker 4>forth on the important shit like </v>
<v Speaker 4>religion and circumcision and this.</v>

1116
00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:16.283
<v Speaker 4>You can have a conversation with the guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what he's doing is he is getting a </v>

1117
00:49:21.371 --> 00:49:23.830
<v Speaker 4>fuck ton of attention through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>streisand effect.</v>

1118
00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:27.670
<v Speaker 4>When you try to silence him by pulling </v>
<v Speaker 4>him out of these,</v>

1119
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:31.510
<v Speaker 4>these things just for speaking and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not doing anything wrong.</v>

1120
00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:32.523
<v Speaker 4>He's just speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The university has allowed him to be </v>

1121
00:49:35.261 --> 00:49:38.110
<v Speaker 4>there and then people are going crazy to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do $100,000</v>

1122
00:49:38.111 --> 00:49:40.090
<v Speaker 4>worth of damage to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the university,</v>

1123
00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:41.163
<v Speaker 4>and then the fucking mayor of San </v>
<v Speaker 4>Francisco congratulates people for </v>

1124
00:49:44.741 --> 00:49:45.574
<v Speaker 4>speaking their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He congratulates people for expressing </v>

1125
00:49:48.101 --> 00:49:49.460
<v Speaker 4>themselves like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1126
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:52.420
<v Speaker 4>that was a fucking riot man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like do you understand what happened?</v>

1127
00:49:52.421 --> 00:49:53.254
<v Speaker 4>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars worth of damage and people </v>

1128
00:49:54.221 --> 00:49:55.054
<v Speaker 4>getting beat up and a girl getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>pepper sprayed for wearing a bitcoin </v>

1129
00:49:57.730 --> 00:49:59.230
<v Speaker 4>hat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not good man.</v>

1130
00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:00.243
<v Speaker 4>I know you want to be progressive and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>know you want to be liberal and I know </v>

1131
00:50:02.171 --> 00:50:04.510
<v Speaker 4>you want to be the mayor of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>progressive place,</v>

1132
00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:09.720
<v Speaker 4>but this is all the wrong message.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The correct message is calm dialogue.</v>

1133
00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.750
<v Speaker 4>People discussing things will keep calm </v>
<v Speaker 4>and remain calm and carry on.</v>

1134
00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.420
<v Speaker 4>So this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Milo,</v>

1135
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:17.350
<v Speaker 4>when you're fucking screaming and </v>
<v Speaker 4>yelling,</v>

1136
00:50:17.351 --> 00:50:19.990
<v Speaker 4>he wins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you stop him from doing that,</v>

1137
00:50:19.991 --> 00:50:22.570
<v Speaker 4>I think he sells more books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're also making a bigger point,</v>

1138
00:50:22.571 --> 00:50:23.404
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is when we become us and we let </v>

1139
00:50:25.361 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 4>them become them and we lose of the fact</v>

1140
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:28.993
<v Speaker 3>that we are all part of one body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when we shine it superorganism </v>

1141
00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.600
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk about wanting to belong to a clan.</v>

1142
00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:38.930
<v Speaker 3>We do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We belong to a very special group.</v>

1143
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:43.280
<v Speaker 3>It's a trip that you're here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you are here at the same time.</v>

1144
00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:45.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm here and we're here talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's beautiful.</v>

1145
00:50:45.711 --> 00:50:47.660
<v Speaker 3>That's what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hippie.</v>

1146
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:53.610
<v Speaker 3>I thought you've taken lsd one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sticking together.</v>

1147
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:57.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm already on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I were.</v>

1148
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:59.060
<v Speaker 3>I'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be going off even deeper,</v>

1149
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.010
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just saying when you take </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics,</v>

1150
00:51:01.011 --> 00:51:05.210
<v Speaker 3>you do get that glimpse into your like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when you give.</v>

1151
00:51:05.211 --> 00:51:07.280
<v Speaker 3>So if I give you a gift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you give me this book,</v>

1152
00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:09.840
<v Speaker 3>it's really just the right hand giving </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to the lefthand.</v>

1153
00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:10.713
<v Speaker 3>It's all one thing so it doesn't work to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight against ourselves and it's not </v>

1154
00:51:15.081 --> 00:51:17.620
<v Speaker 3>good to call somebody them and to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>divided.</v>

1155
00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:18.371
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also,</v>

1156
00:51:18.371 --> 00:51:19.204
<v Speaker 4>there's no communication going on when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're screaming and lighting things on </v>

1157
00:51:20.921 --> 00:51:23.830
<v Speaker 4>fire and breaking windows at starbucks </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not communicating.</v>

1158
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:24.853
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're expressing your anger that this </v>

1159
00:51:25.511 --> 00:51:28.570
<v Speaker 4>guy who says that feminism is cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk to them.</v>

1160
00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:31.960
<v Speaker 4>Try to figure out why he's saying that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we have a debate with them.</v>

1161
00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:32.913
<v Speaker 4>If you disagree with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>find out what he's saying that's not </v>

1162
00:51:35.531 --> 00:51:40.000
<v Speaker 4>valid and have a counterpoint to it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how people get to share ideas,</v>

1163
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:43.000
<v Speaker 4>express themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the people watching get to look</v>

1164
00:51:43.001 --> 00:51:44.260
<v Speaker 4>at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1165
00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.153
<v Speaker 4>he had a point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then his points better and then you </v>

1166
00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:48.153
<v Speaker 4>figure it out and that's the marketplace</v>
<v Speaker 4>of ideas and that's how human beings </v>

1167
00:51:49.871 --> 00:51:51.700
<v Speaker 4>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as soon as you stop that,</v>

1168
00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:52.713
<v Speaker 4>as soon as you stop free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fuck the whole God damn thing up </v>

1169
00:51:55.961 --> 00:51:56.794
<v Speaker 4>because now you have decided that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fascist and you're saying that your </v>

1170
00:52:00.401 --> 00:52:02.140
<v Speaker 4>ideas are more important than other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people's.</v>

1171
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:05.310
<v Speaker 3>Don't you do a good devil's advocate </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

1172
00:52:05.311 --> 00:52:09.660
<v Speaker 3>but don't you worry that some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are making more base kind of</v>

1173
00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:14.690
<v Speaker 3>dismissive generalizations like feminism</v>
<v Speaker 3>is bad and Muslims are bad,</v>

1174
00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:16.533
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aren't necessarily listening to an </v>

1175
00:52:18.991 --> 00:52:19.824
<v Speaker 3>intelligent dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so therefore isn't there sort of like a </v>

1176
00:52:22.111 --> 00:52:24.510
<v Speaker 3>cause and effect of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is some crazy shit.</v>

1177
00:52:24.511 --> 00:52:26.280
<v Speaker 3>We're going to do some crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some</v>

1178
00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:31.020
<v Speaker 4>of them listen to Doris writing pepper </v>
<v Speaker 4>spray and some of them aren't listening,</v>

1179
00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:31.883
<v Speaker 4>but I think you always have to appeal to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the higher side of human consciousness </v>

1180
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:36.023
<v Speaker 4>and you always have to express yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the most articulate way that you are </v>

1181
00:52:40.081 --> 00:52:40.914
<v Speaker 4>capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you should try your best to get your </v>

1182
00:52:43.561 --> 00:52:45.390
<v Speaker 4>thoughts across and it's not always </v>
<v Speaker 4>easy.</v>

1183
00:52:45.391 --> 00:52:48.630
<v Speaker 4>It's oftentimes very difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when emotions are involved,</v>

1184
00:52:48.631 --> 00:52:50.760
<v Speaker 4>especially when you think this causes </v>
<v Speaker 4>very important,</v>

1185
00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:54.420
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's critical because you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing something in a very public way,</v>

1186
00:52:54.421 --> 00:52:55.254
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because this is something that people </v>

1187
00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:58.380
<v Speaker 4>are going to talk about for months and </v>
<v Speaker 4>months.</v>

1188
00:52:58.381 --> 00:53:00.990
<v Speaker 4>There'll be talking about the UC </v>
<v Speaker 4>Berkeley riots for a long time.</v>

1189
00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.393
<v Speaker 4>It's very critical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think whenever you're dealing with </v>

1190
00:53:03.901 --> 00:53:04.734
<v Speaker 4>something that is going to get massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>exposure like that to do your very best </v>

1191
00:53:07.741 --> 00:53:12.480
<v Speaker 4>to communicate your thoughts without all</v>
<v Speaker 4>this extra bullshit attached to them and</v>

1192
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:13.343
<v Speaker 4>anger and screaming and yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get lost and don't get lost in it </v>

1193
00:53:16.501 --> 00:53:21.501
<v Speaker 4>and and figure out a way to vocalize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to articulate the the,</v>

1194
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:26.750
<v Speaker 4>the reason why you feel a certain way </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what you have thought about it.</v>

1195
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.990
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

1196
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:30.390
<v Speaker 4>not some knee jerk bullshit that's easy </v>
<v Speaker 4>to dismiss.</v>

1197
00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:31.830
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Muslims are bad,</v>

1198
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:36.870
<v Speaker 4>this is bad and that's bad and feminism </v>
<v Speaker 4>is for full composed w not that way.</v>

1199
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:41.520
<v Speaker 4>Now to express why you think Milo's </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>

1200
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:42.383
<v Speaker 4>Express why you think he's right and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the marketplace of ideas and you </v>

1201
00:53:45.811 --> 00:53:47.760
<v Speaker 4>might disagree with that person that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking to,</v>

1202
00:53:47.761 --> 00:53:48.594
<v Speaker 4>but you've got to let them talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to let them talk and then you </v>

1203
00:53:50.531 --> 00:53:52.590
<v Speaker 4>got to figure out a way to counter what </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're saying.</v>

1204
00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:53.883
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1205
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:54.743
<v Speaker 4>not a good devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people worry when we let these </v>

1206
00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:00.490
<v Speaker 4>people talk and I went to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you say these people though,</v>

1207
00:54:00.491 --> 00:54:03.750
<v Speaker 4>Milo is not something to worry about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not a guy who advocates violence.</v>

1208
00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:05.700
<v Speaker 4>He's a really interesting guy to talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

1209
00:54:05.701 --> 00:54:06.534
<v Speaker 4>He's kind of a troll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean what he's doing is fucking with </v>

1210
00:54:08.191 --> 00:54:09.024
<v Speaker 4>people and it's really accurate and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>really what he's doing is being very </v>

1211
00:54:12.331 --> 00:54:13.450
<v Speaker 4>effective and he's.</v>

1212
00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:14.293
<v Speaker 4>He's getting people to buy his books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's getting people to come to his </v>

1213
00:54:15.961 --> 00:54:18.780
<v Speaker 4>lectures is getting people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When he got banned from twitter,</v>

1214
00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.630
<v Speaker 4>that was probably the best thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>could've ever happened to him.</v>

1215
00:54:21.631 --> 00:54:23.340
<v Speaker 4>He did like a hundred interviews </v>
<v Speaker 4>afterwards.</v>

1216
00:54:23.341 --> 00:54:27.330
<v Speaker 4>It was on CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even cnn they're doing like CNN supposed</v>

1217
00:54:27.331 --> 00:54:28.380
<v Speaker 4>to be news,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1218
00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:31.140
<v Speaker 4>So He.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a photo of him.</v>

1219
00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:34.650
<v Speaker 4>Ridiculous photos were in a fur coat </v>
<v Speaker 4>with sunglasses on because it's so silly</v>

1220
00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:35.903
<v Speaker 4>and it says Milo Yiannopoulos is trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to go to colleges to convince them that </v>

1221
00:54:40.111 --> 00:54:40.944
<v Speaker 4>hate speech is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how the fuck is that an article on </v>

1222
00:54:43.711 --> 00:54:45.870
<v Speaker 4>CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is CNN saying that?</v>

1223
00:54:45.871 --> 00:54:46.704
<v Speaker 4>Because that's not what he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not saying that hate speech is </v>

1224
00:54:49.051 --> 00:54:50.460
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that right there.</v>

1225
00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:53.820
<v Speaker 4>Miley Annapolis is trying to convince </v>
<v Speaker 4>colleges that hate speech is cool.</v>

1226
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:56.550
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The News?</v>

1227
00:54:56.580 --> 00:55:00.600
<v Speaker 4>It's not the news that is heavily </v>
<v Speaker 4>editorialized that it.</v>

1228
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:01.463
<v Speaker 4>That's a ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're taking a stance on his opinion </v>

1229
00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:10.080
<v Speaker 4>that he would rabidly disagree with and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not right and this is.</v>

1230
00:55:10.081 --> 00:55:13.980
<v Speaker 4>This is left versus right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like CNN is the new Fox News.</v>

1231
00:55:13.981 --> 00:55:18.480
<v Speaker 4>CNN is the sky's falling and the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>is shared and we're fucked,</v>

1232
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:23.100
<v Speaker 4>and Fox News is now all of a sudden the </v>
<v Speaker 4>grass is green and everything's rosy and</v>

1233
00:55:23.101 --> 00:55:25.920
<v Speaker 4>we're making America great again with </v>
<v Speaker 4>bizarre.</v>

1234
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:26.783
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting because you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to zoom out and I think that's one of </v>

1235
00:55:28.621 --> 00:55:29.454
<v Speaker 4>the things that's very integral to kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of getting through a time like this is </v>

1236
00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:32.740
<v Speaker 4>zooming out and going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1237
00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:33.603
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at what's happening in a big </v>

1238
00:55:34.981 --> 00:55:35.814
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're becoming what we don't want to </v>

1239
00:55:38.521 --> 00:55:39.960
<v Speaker 4>become.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're becoming militant.</v>

1240
00:55:39.961 --> 00:55:42.060
<v Speaker 4>We're becoming violent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're becoming fearful,</v>

1241
00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:43.283
<v Speaker 4>and I would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish there were more opportunities to </v>

1242
00:55:45.241 --> 00:55:46.350
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess these,</v>

1243
00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.780
<v Speaker 4>these dialogues that could be done </v>
<v Speaker 4>peaceably well.</v>

1244
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:49.613
<v Speaker 4>I think there's an issue also in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people do not feel like Donald Trump </v>

1245
00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:53.724
<v Speaker 4>represents what they think of as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>leader in their mind and a lot of </v>

1246
00:55:56.941 --> 00:55:57.774
<v Speaker 4>people's mind and in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Barack Obama was an amazing leader and </v>

1247
00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:04.050
<v Speaker 4>people will get mad and pissed at you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially conservatives.</v>

1248
00:56:04.051 --> 00:56:05.140
<v Speaker 4>We will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you prone to?</v>

1249
00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.460
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy was smart.</v>

1250
00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:11.880
<v Speaker 4>He was articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was calm and measured.</v>

1251
00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:16.080
<v Speaker 4>Any always seemed like he wanted what </v>
<v Speaker 4>was best for the country.</v>

1252
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:18.150
<v Speaker 4>Whether you agree or disagree with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>policy.</v>

1253
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:23.390
<v Speaker 4>He and my mind was very statesmen like I</v>
<v Speaker 4>agree the way he would say when you're</v>

1254
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.360
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're playing a part,</v>

1255
00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:26.253
<v Speaker 1>the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying the president is a </v>

1256
00:56:26.921 --> 00:56:27.754
<v Speaker 1>puppet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying part of it is the </v>

1257
00:56:29.141 --> 00:56:32.380
<v Speaker 1>mythological role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am the president and that's why people</v>

1258
00:56:32.381 --> 00:56:36.490
<v Speaker 1>talk about acting presidential because </v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of it is that?</v>

1259
00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:37.683
<v Speaker 1>How much of it is the way you handle </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and the way that you treat </v>

1260
00:56:39.761 --> 00:56:44.761
<v Speaker 1>other people and the way that you tweet </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the way that the apprentice sucking?</v>

1261
00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sad period.</v>

1262
00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:47.860
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange.</v>

1263
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:49.270
<v Speaker 1>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the vocabulary,</v>

1264
00:56:49.271 --> 00:56:51.880
<v Speaker 1>I see a lot of the trolls using some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

1265
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying don't do that too.</v>

1266
00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:57.070
<v Speaker 1>They say sad at the end of the surgery </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Joe Rogan's podcast,</v>

1267
00:56:57.130 --> 00:56:58.420
<v Speaker 1>sewing up behind president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1268
00:56:58.421 --> 00:56:59.050
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1269
00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:00.920
<v Speaker 1>said Cook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did this.</v>

1270
00:57:00.921 --> 00:57:04.150
<v Speaker 1>What's it like to be a cook?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1271
00:57:04.151 --> 00:57:07.870
<v Speaker 1>it happened because that's what one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the response.</v>

1272
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:10.840
<v Speaker 1>We tried one way we didn't like it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're trying the other way.</v>

1273
00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:11.673
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic example of what human </v>

1274
00:57:13.331 --> 00:57:14.164
<v Speaker 1>beings do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1275
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:15.303
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1276
00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.840
<v Speaker 1>that's zoomed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

1277
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:17.703
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that the idea of a </v>

1278
00:57:19.001 --> 00:57:19.834
<v Speaker 1>president is the smartest idea to run a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of 350 million people that are </v>

1279
00:57:24.401 --> 00:57:29.401
<v Speaker 1>trying to integrate and communicate with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other 7 billion people in the world.</v>

1280
00:57:29.801 --> 00:57:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Democracy isn't the best form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

1281
00:57:32.411 --> 00:57:34.840
<v Speaker 1>It's just the safest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to quote,</v>

1282
00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:37.300
<v Speaker 1>safest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have A.</v>

1283
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Patriarchy would be far more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what they were like.</v>

1284
00:57:39.371 --> 00:57:42.350
<v Speaker 1>If you had a benevolent ruler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a really big good one,</v>

1285
00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.880
<v Speaker 1>that would be more effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's too risky to do that.</v>

1286
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:46.743
<v Speaker 1>Way Too risky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just contrary to human nature and </v>

1287
00:57:48.471 --> 00:57:52.420
<v Speaker 1>absolute power corrupts absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a wavy gravy is easy.</v>

1288
00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was as kind as he is.</v>

1289
00:57:54.161 --> 00:57:54.994
<v Speaker 1>I think he's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This like weird hippie guy that kind of </v>

1290
00:57:56.441 --> 00:57:57.274
<v Speaker 1>like the comedian of the time we did all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychedelic koolaid acid trip bus </v>

1291
00:58:02.330 --> 00:58:03.163
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1292
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.353
<v Speaker 1>He had a funny joke where he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to nominate nobody for </v>

1293
00:58:07.061 --> 00:58:07.894
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like we should vote for nobody </v>

1294
00:58:09.101 --> 00:58:09.934
<v Speaker 1>because nobody can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it had all these funny slogans were </v>

1295
00:58:11.531 --> 00:58:14.740
<v Speaker 1>it was like nobody can solve our </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic prowess problems.</v>

1296
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Nobody cares about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all these funny thing.</v>

1297
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.380
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more people vote for nobody than any</v>

1298
00:58:20.381 --> 00:58:22.810
<v Speaker 1>other candidate combined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to get nobody in the office.</v>

1299
00:58:22.811 --> 00:58:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what Neil degrasse Tyson </v>
<v Speaker 1>posted?</v>

1300
00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.650
<v Speaker 1>He said there should be an option for </v>
<v Speaker 1>none of the above.</v>

1301
00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Then if none of the above winds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we start the process all over again.</v>

1302
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:31.023
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1303
00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:32.820
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people would have done </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1304
00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a great idea because to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make this artificial limitation like,</v>

1305
00:58:37.331 --> 00:58:38.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the people.</v>

1306
00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:39.493
<v Speaker 1>It isn't able to grasp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I shouldn't be surprised how many </v>

1307
00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:45.520
<v Speaker 1>people would have lined up and gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>all around every way.</v>

1308
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.620
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't have been live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tried to vote to have been like,</v>

1309
00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm voting that we need to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to go back to one for,</v>

1310
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:53.140
<v Speaker 1>for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the other things.</v>

1311
00:58:53.141 --> 00:58:55.660
<v Speaker 1>You get to vote for it and then for </v>
<v Speaker 1>president vote none of the above.</v>

1312
00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I bet it would have been like 70 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the country.</v>

1313
00:58:58.030 --> 00:58:59.010
<v Speaker 1>I would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have been.</v>

1314
00:58:59.040 --> 00:58:59.873
<v Speaker 1>Would it have been something crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would have done it just for the </v>

1315
00:59:01.241 --> 00:59:03.430
<v Speaker 1>novelty of it been like I was the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>one to vote.</v>

1316
00:59:03.431 --> 00:59:05.110
<v Speaker 1>None of the above.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wouldn't.</v>

1317
00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:06.660
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't been the first would know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1318
00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it would have been most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country because I think that even if you</v>

1319
00:59:10.211 --> 00:59:13.270
<v Speaker 1>were opposed to trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's very few people who thought that</v>

1320
00:59:13.271 --> 00:59:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Hillary was the ideal candidate for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was incredibly flawed.</v>

1321
00:59:16.391 --> 00:59:19.180
<v Speaker 1>She had deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep ties to financial institutions.</v>

1322
00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:22.100
<v Speaker 1>She wouldn't release the transcripts </v>
<v Speaker 1>from and people get so mad</v>

1323
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:24.290
<v Speaker 4>when you talk about these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're the reason why trump won,</v>

1324
00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:25.730
<v Speaker 4>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a big part of it,</v>

1325
00:59:25.731 --> 00:59:26.564
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You kept harping all the problems that </v>

1326
00:59:27.291 --> 00:59:28.124
<v Speaker 4>Hillary has said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to ignore what's </v>

1327
00:59:30.321 --> 00:59:32.930
<v Speaker 4>real and true and obvious about a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

1328
00:59:32.931 --> 00:59:36.230
<v Speaker 4>If the other person has flaws as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not how it works.</v>

1329
00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:37.123
<v Speaker 4>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how you box yourself in and put </v>

1330
00:59:38.931 --> 00:59:39.764
<v Speaker 4>blinders on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not lifting up and looking at it </v>

1331
00:59:41.541 --> 00:59:46.541
<v Speaker 4>objectively right above there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reality is it's an insane job to put</v>

1332
00:59:46.731 --> 00:59:51.731
<v Speaker 4>one person in power of all these people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there should be a large group of</v>

1333
00:59:51.861 --> 00:59:52.694
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should probably be chosen by a large </v>

1334
00:59:54.111 --> 00:59:57.170
<v Speaker 4>group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that voting should be far easier</v>

1335
00:59:57.171 --> 00:59:58.004
<v Speaker 4>than it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think registering to vote should be </v>

1336
00:59:59.151 --> 00:59:59.984
<v Speaker 4>far easier than it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should be something as simple as you </v>

1337
01:00:01.761 --> 01:00:04.700
<v Speaker 4>have a social security number,</v>
<v Speaker 4>punching your social security number.</v>

1338
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:06.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it shows here you're over 18.</v>

1339
01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:07.671
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can vote.</v>

1340
01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:09.710
<v Speaker 4>It should be that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you not a felon?</v>

1341
01:00:09.711 --> 01:00:10.550
<v Speaker 4>You're not a felon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1342
01:00:10.551 --> 01:00:13.450
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can vote to vote online.</v>

1343
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:15.543
<v Speaker 4>Have a light buzz on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shouldn't there be like maybe some sort </v>

1344
01:00:18.831 --> 01:00:19.730
<v Speaker 4>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a,</v>

1345
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:24.970
<v Speaker 4>just a very light test to determine what</v>
<v Speaker 4>your understanding is of these bills,</v>

1346
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:31.100
<v Speaker 4>what your understanding is about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>impact of these things,</v>

1347
01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:33.830
<v Speaker 4>what your understanding is about what </v>
<v Speaker 4>this entails.</v>

1348
01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:34.693
<v Speaker 4>I always think it's the immigrants that </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand that stuff because they had </v>

1349
01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:37.973
<v Speaker 4>to go through a very rigorous process </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you asked me what the bill of </v>

1350
01:00:40.581 --> 01:00:42.260
<v Speaker 4>rights is and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1351
01:00:42.261 --> 01:00:43.094
<v Speaker 4>Bob care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I was a kid I used to deliver </v>

1352
01:00:45.621 --> 01:00:47.980
<v Speaker 4>newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I say a kid,</v>

1353
01:00:47.981 --> 01:00:52.981
<v Speaker 4>I was driving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know when I was 16 and 18 and when I</v>

1354
01:00:53.361 --> 01:00:55.760
<v Speaker 4>was delivering newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was this guy named a non,</v>

1355
01:00:56.170 --> 01:01:01.170
<v Speaker 4>a non and a n a n d,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this Indian gentleman who used to work,</v>

1356
01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.480
<v Speaker 4>he was a pharmaceutical expert in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>

1357
01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.820
<v Speaker 4>but when he came to America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1358
01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:08.903
<v Speaker 4>his degree didn't translate over here </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so he's becoming an American </v>

1359
01:01:11.211 --> 01:01:13.250
<v Speaker 4>citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he would always.</v>

1360
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:14.990
<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a hilarious little dude.</v>

1361
01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.093
<v Speaker 4>He used to swear all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I weighed about 100 pounds and he'd be </v>

1362
01:01:18.231 --> 01:01:19.880
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could easily throw them.</v>

1363
01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:22.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could throw him like a beach ball.</v>

1364
01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.020
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know shit.</v>

1365
01:01:24.021 --> 01:01:24.854
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows shit in this fucking </v>

1366
01:01:26.781 --> 01:01:28.610
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What'd you do in this fucking country?</v>

1367
01:01:28.611 --> 01:01:30.440
<v Speaker 4>Who come here and then you'll go home </v>
<v Speaker 4>and go to sleep.</v>

1368
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.453
<v Speaker 4>You don't fucking know shit about your </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking laws because he was trying to </v>

1369
01:01:33.981 --> 01:01:34.814
<v Speaker 4>read all this stuff because he had to </v>
<v Speaker 4>become a citizen so you to take all </v>

1370
01:01:36.591 --> 01:01:40.490
<v Speaker 4>these tasks and so he was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would ask me questions,</v>

1371
01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.800
<v Speaker 4>do you know you know what the 13th </v>
<v Speaker 4>amendment is?</v>

1372
01:01:42.801 --> 01:01:45.020
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what the 14th amendment?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

1373
01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:46.610
<v Speaker 4>and I believe I don't know any of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

1374
01:01:46.611 --> 01:01:48.340
<v Speaker 4>and he'd laugh and get the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1375
01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.050
<v Speaker 4>Go do your route.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is a real friendly kids.</v>

1376
01:01:51.051 --> 01:01:52.220
<v Speaker 4>Children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1377
01:01:52.221 --> 01:01:53.390
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know the value.</v>

1378
01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:54.233
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to and people tend to do </v>

1379
01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:57.044
<v Speaker 4>what they have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the way you become an immigrant </v>

1380
01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:00.374
<v Speaker 4>in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to go through a comprehensive </v>

1381
01:02:01.581 --> 01:02:03.800
<v Speaker 4>test and you have to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 4>history of the United States.</v>

1382
01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.310
<v Speaker 4>That test should probably be what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to go through to vote.</v>

1383
01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:09.650
<v Speaker 4>It's funny because I'm agreeing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1384
01:02:09.651 --> 01:02:10.484
<v Speaker 4>but we're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm agreeing with is we should </v>

1385
01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:12.194
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously make it very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very easy social security number and </v>

1386
01:02:14.601 --> 01:02:15.560
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very difficult.</v>

1387
01:02:15.561 --> 01:02:18.920
<v Speaker 4>Very easy to be registered to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's not something go up.</v>

1388
01:02:18.921 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 4>You missed the deadline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck</v>

1389
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your vote doesn't count.</v>

1390
01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:21.774
<v Speaker 1>How quiet would the line be to vote?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would all be studying like popped one </v>

1391
01:02:26.461 --> 01:02:29.480
<v Speaker 1>random question and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Frederick Douglass,</v>

1392
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:30.343
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes you'd have to do it online </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you did it online you'd be able </v>

1393
01:02:33.391 --> 01:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>to cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even if you were ever to achieve,</v>

1394
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.140
<v Speaker 1>even if you were to what's more American</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>

1395
01:02:37.210 --> 01:02:40.240
<v Speaker 1>but mean be looking it up on Google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1396
01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:44.400
<v Speaker 1>But even then at least some of that data</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to get into your fucking head.</v>

1397
01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1398
01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's gotta be better than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding that most people have.</v>

1399
01:02:48.541 --> 01:02:49.374
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's historical or whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a comprehensive understanding of </v>

1400
01:02:51.991 --> 01:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>how our electoral process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because googling it doesn't stick.</v>

1401
01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.150
<v Speaker 1>That was tom's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

1402
01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember shit like I have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to things about three,</v>

1403
01:03:00.331 --> 01:03:01.164
<v Speaker 1>four times before I finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think it's because they </v>

1404
01:03:03.841 --> 01:03:06.060
<v Speaker 1>don't have like an emotional connection </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you?</v>

1405
01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I read it's really important.</v>

1406
01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I had a bit about.</v>

1407
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Well where I was like the time between </v>
<v Speaker 1>not knowing and knowing is so brief.</v>

1408
01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:15.423
<v Speaker 1>There's no feeling associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing like you don't get adrenaline </v>

1409
01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.910
<v Speaker 1>and adrenaline is linked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Linked to memory,</v>

1410
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:23.490
<v Speaker 1>like adrenaline is linked to memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1411
01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:24.953
<v Speaker 1>This is right up your alley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're ever trying to memorize </v>

1412
01:03:26.041 --> 01:03:27.420
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>College kids listening,</v>

1413
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:28.363
<v Speaker 1>get to studying for a test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dip your arm and ice water every 30 </v>

1414
01:03:30.871 --> 01:03:33.870
<v Speaker 1>minutes or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will become a traumatic experience.</v>

1415
01:03:33.871 --> 01:03:34.704
<v Speaker 1>It will help you memorize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why we have a hard time for </v>

1416
01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:38.400
<v Speaker 1>getting trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a very light trauma.</v>

1417
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:39.263
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

1418
01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Or a trauma by just ice water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not that traumatic at all.</v>

1419
01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Big Old tank and dunk here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1420
01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:47.660
<v Speaker 1>they've done controlled studies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>memorize.</v>

1421
01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:48.690
<v Speaker 1>What a great idea.</v>

1422
01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be like you could memorize</v>

1423
01:03:50.971 --> 01:03:53.960
<v Speaker 1>things really good in a cryo tank if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>did like crow genic.</v>

1424
01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.260
<v Speaker 1>I've never done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you?</v>

1425
01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I do it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1426
01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:02.160
<v Speaker 1>You fucking feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 250 degrees below zero.</v>

1427
01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Is that unbearable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1428
01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.600
<v Speaker 1>You do it for three minutes for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

1429
01:04:06.601 --> 01:04:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three minutes.</v>

1430
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:08.363
<v Speaker 1>For some reason I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they figured it out a way to make you </v>

1431
01:04:09.961 --> 01:04:10.990
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't expect it.</v>

1432
01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:13.440
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You experienced the fucker.</v>

1433
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>What about infrared Saunas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did one this morning.</v>

1434
01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't fuck around with that.</v>

1435
01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:18.653
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan is good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent messaging for a mixed blessing </v>

1436
01:04:23.581 --> 01:04:25.110
<v Speaker 1>for memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress in the brain,</v>

1437
01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:25.944
<v Speaker 1>brain connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The limbic system includes the </v>

1438
01:04:28.801 --> 01:04:30.570
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hippocampus,</v>

1439
01:04:30.571 --> 01:04:31.404
<v Speaker 1>and these only one Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just throws it up on the board and </v>

1440
01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:33.943
<v Speaker 1>the Amigdala and other important brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that govern emotional </v>

1441
01:04:36.061 --> 01:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>responses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and longterm memory.</v>

1442
01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.240
<v Speaker 1>The release of adrenaline increases </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of activity of these areas of the</v>

1443
01:04:42.241 --> 01:04:43.860
<v Speaker 1>brain has been associated with improved </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>

1444
01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:44.813
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny like the words that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>googled our bold this we were living in </v>

1445
01:04:49.831 --> 01:04:52.600
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So amazing.</v>

1446
01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:55.830
<v Speaker 1>But the bit I had was that Google's </v>
<v Speaker 1>making A.</v>

1447
01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:56.873
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of the reasons I got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a talk show after Conan and I did </v>

1448
01:04:59.731 --> 01:05:00.564
<v Speaker 1>these two Conan's sets and I think I </v>
<v Speaker 1>picked good material and the first one </v>

1449
01:05:04.171 --> 01:05:05.004
<v Speaker 1>was about how google is like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculator that helps you cheat at </v>

1450
01:05:07.621 --> 01:05:10.200
<v Speaker 1>everything that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't know anything.</v>

1451
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.983
<v Speaker 1>And the example I give is there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time like I've been in bed and I'm just </v>

1452
01:05:14.491 --> 01:05:17.090
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's Tom Petty from mean?</v>

1453
01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I just look it</v>

1454
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.813
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Running.</v>

1455
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.320
<v Speaker 5>That was a real example,</v>

1456
01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:23.453
<v Speaker 3>but back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't know where Tom Petty was </v>

1457
01:05:24.611 --> 01:05:25.444
<v Speaker 3>strumming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just go around and ask people lie </v>

1458
01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.940
<v Speaker 3>jail bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was born in Asia.</v>

1459
01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:30.973
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

1460
01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.100
<v Speaker 3>and they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy his long hair.</v>

1461
01:05:35.101 --> 01:05:36.680
<v Speaker 3>He looks like California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe California.</v>

1462
01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:37.723
<v Speaker 3>Then one day you'd meet a girl and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>heartbreakers tee shirt and she'd tell </v>

1463
01:05:39.801 --> 01:05:40.634
<v Speaker 3>you Florida and endorphins and </v>
<v Speaker 3>adrenaline and all this things would </v>

1464
01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:44.443
<v Speaker 3>light up in your brain and you remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>that moment for the rest of your life </v>

1465
01:05:46.311 --> 01:05:47.144
<v Speaker 3>and that's how you met your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the few awesome things from </v>

1466
01:05:48.951 --> 01:05:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like Leonard Skinner,</v>

1467
01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:53.150
<v Speaker 3>Tom Petty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Billy Corbin,</v>

1468
01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.250
<v Speaker 3>who was doing cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cowboys,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It already is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it really is.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I went to,</v>

1487
01:06:37.151 --> 01:06:41.650
<v Speaker 3>I did a corporate show at Disney world </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it ended at like 10:00</v>

1488

<v Speaker 3>eight.</v>

1491
01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:52.383
<v Speaker 3>So I went up to the gate and I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the girl that I'm trying to get into </v>

<v Speaker 3>I just put my hands up and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>daisy,</v>

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sorry if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if anyone asks,</v>

1506
01:07:24.281 --> 01:07:26.260

<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

1508
01:07:29.171 --> 01:07:30.950
<v Speaker 3>please don't please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was Kinda,</v>

1509
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:32.950
<v Speaker 3>I was kinda being a dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was just like,</v>

1510
01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:36.220

<v Speaker 3>And I walked and you go over this bridge</v>

1511
01:07:36.221 --> 01:07:37.054
<v Speaker 3>when you get in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as soon as I got over the bridge I </v>

1512
01:07:38.201 --> 01:07:39.220
<v Speaker 3>felt like a refugee.</v>

1513
01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.780
<v Speaker 3>Going back to Tom Petty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1514
01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.840
<v Speaker 3>One of the best nights of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my heart closed.</v>

1515
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.823
<v Speaker 3>We had some Saki.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was with this young lady that was </v>

1516
01:07:46.631 --> 01:07:49.030
<v Speaker 3>organizing the event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had soccer,</v>

1517
01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:50.710
<v Speaker 3>soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>soccer.</v>

1518
01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:54.970
<v Speaker 3>I play soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I've never heard anybody</v>

1519
01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:56.200
<v Speaker 3>say soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think you're right.</v>

1520
01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:01.360
<v Speaker 3>But we drank it and everything in epcot </v>
<v Speaker 3>is unlocked so the park is closed.</v>

1521
01:08:01.361 --> 01:08:02.194
<v Speaker 3>It's dark and we're waiting to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>kicked out and we're opening every door </v>

1522
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:07.810
<v Speaker 3>going into rides that have been shut </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1523
01:08:07.811 --> 01:08:09.050
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the more hands in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gears.</v>

1524
01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:12.310
<v Speaker 5>What makes this thing work?</v>
<v Speaker 5>My finger was there,</v>

1525
01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:14.000
<v Speaker 5>could turn it off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was going that way.</v>

1526
01:08:14.001 --> 01:08:15.960
<v Speaker 5>It cut my hand off right here.</v>

1527
01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:20.300
<v Speaker 3>Then I jumped fences and swam and every </v>
<v Speaker 3>pool.</v>

1528
01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:20.991
<v Speaker 3>I-Pass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1529
01:08:20.991 --> 01:08:21.824
<v Speaker 3>you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was one of the best nights of my </v>

1530
01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:23.690
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You jumped fences.</v>

1531
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:25.850
<v Speaker 3>Once you broke one law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1532
01:08:25.851 --> 01:08:26.900
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a rebel.</v>

1533
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.793
<v Speaker 3>You get a little sack and you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you get the feeling of </v>

1534
01:08:29.721 --> 01:08:32.570
<v Speaker 3>entitlement that Disney provides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make you feel so important.</v>

1535
01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.210
<v Speaker 3>It's one of my theories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think rich people are assholes,</v>

1536
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:37.670
<v Speaker 3>is because have you ever stayed at like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a four seasons or something?</v>

1537
01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.470
<v Speaker 3>Then if you say at the four seasons and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they love you and,</v>

1538
01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.241
<v Speaker 3>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hello,</v>

1539
01:08:41.241 --> 01:08:43.820
<v Speaker 3>Mr Rogen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we noticed your room isn't quite ready.</v>

1540

<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1541
01:08:45.201 --> 01:08:48.020
<v Speaker 3>They just kiss your ass so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you go,</v>

1542
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.943
<v Speaker 3>I had this happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stayed at the four seasons in Hawaii </v>

1543
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:54.350
<v Speaker 3>and then the next week I was on the road</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Portland and I was staying at a best</v>

1544
01:08:54.351 --> 01:08:55.184
<v Speaker 3>western.</v>

1545
01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.400
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why rich people are dicks.</v>

1546
01:08:58.401 --> 01:08:59.560
<v Speaker 3>Because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

1547
01:08:59.570 --> 01:09:01.400
<v Speaker 3>your room's not ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was just like,</v>

1548
01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:02.593
<v Speaker 3>could you call me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they looked at me like I was </v>

1549
01:09:03.921 --> 01:09:04.731
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

1550
01:09:04.731 --> 01:09:05.564
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to call you when it's </v>

1551
01:09:06.261 --> 01:09:09.950
<v Speaker 3>ready to go get a fucking hundred grand </v>
<v Speaker 3>bar and sit down.</v>

1552
01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.233
<v Speaker 3>Nobody cares.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sandbar John Molina is the best bit he </v>

1553
01:09:14.961 --> 01:09:17.240
<v Speaker 3>did snl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell the story like it's my own.</v>

1554
01:09:17.241 --> 01:09:18.074
<v Speaker 3>I don't even give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was writing for Mick Jagger on snl </v>

1555
01:09:20.841 --> 01:09:21.674
<v Speaker 3>and it really helped me understand why </v>
<v Speaker 3>rich people and celebrities can be rude </v>

1556
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:27.500
<v Speaker 3>because he's watching mcjagger go like </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet coke.</v>

1557
01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.510
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not being an asshole,</v>

1558
01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:30.890
<v Speaker 3>but also not being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1562

<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

1564
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:43.850
<v Speaker 3>You're not polite to Siri and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're that famous,</v>

1565
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.850

<v Speaker 3>So you know what I'm saying?</v>

1567
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:51.223
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what Siri is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because this is the way you know </v>

1568
01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:56.930
<v Speaker 3>that you're talking to somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know they're not Siri,</v>

1569
01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:57.793
<v Speaker 3>but they become Siri.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have five decades of everyone </v>

1570
01:10:00.981 --> 01:10:02.390
<v Speaker 3>kissing,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you eat a cookie.</v>

1573

<v Speaker 3>them to the center of my universe.</v>

1577
01:10:17.781 --> 01:10:19.580
<v Speaker 3>Texted me a fake photo.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I recorded this thing.</v>

1585
01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:38.023
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to around us in the car.</v>

01:10:58.670 --> 01:11:00.620
<v Speaker 3>Why would they do that to Lightening </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jack?</v>

1593
01:11:00.621 --> 01:11:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Now you're assuming I can upgrade my </v>
<v Speaker 3>car,</v>

1594
01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:04.813
<v Speaker 3>my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an adapter that allows you to </v>

1595
01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:08.054
<v Speaker 3>use an ox jack and the lightning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an adapter to make steve jobs </v>

1596
01:11:11.181 --> 01:11:13.500
<v Speaker 3>rollover more efficiently in his grave</v>

1597
01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:15.533
<v Speaker 2>because of the whole idea is no adapters</v>
<v Speaker 2>sticking out of your fucking phone like </v>

1598
01:11:19.651 --> 01:11:21.390
<v Speaker 2>a second Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't have it,</v>

1599
01:11:21.391 --> 01:11:24.480
<v Speaker 2>people wouldn't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the option for an adapter.</v>

1600
01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:26.490
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this phone started sucking ass.</v>

1601
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:27.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like crashing and shit and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1602
01:11:27.991 --> 01:11:29.760
<v Speaker 2>if I bought a new one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are fucking.</v>

1603
01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they throw things in the mix.</v>

1604
01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.400
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's a true conspiracy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1605
01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:38.130
<v Speaker 2>I think whenever you get a new iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the new brother,</v>

1606
01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:38.973
<v Speaker 2>a new iphones released magically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my old iphone starts hiccuping soon as </v>

1607
01:11:43.501 --> 01:11:45.930
<v Speaker 2>that God damn I'm operating system gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>updated.</v>

1608
01:11:45.931 --> 01:11:47.520
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they force you into it.</v>

1609
01:11:47.521 --> 01:11:48.354
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to sync my phone to the </v>

1610
01:11:49.771 --> 01:11:51.600
<v Speaker 2>computer and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to update your software.</v>

1611
01:11:51.601 --> 01:11:53.880
<v Speaker 2>I had been resisting you fucking bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1612
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:55.470
<v Speaker 2>fuck your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

1613
01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.350
<v Speaker 2>I was listening around us and this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>recorded in the eighties,</v>

1614
01:11:58.351 --> 01:11:59.184
<v Speaker 2>maybe early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he talks about Donald trump and </v>

1615
01:12:00.601 --> 01:12:01.434
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty fun.</v>

1616
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.700
<v Speaker 2>It's only a minute long lit</v>

1617
01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:05.970
<v Speaker 6>hero figure within that mythic </v>
<v Speaker 6>structure.</v>

1618
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:08.490
<v Speaker 6>It starts here that caught your </v>
<v Speaker 6>attention to Donald Trump,</v>

1619
01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.473
<v Speaker 6>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now you may snicker and not want him as </v>

1620
01:12:13.411 --> 01:12:15.450
<v Speaker 6>a mythic hero figure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he is,</v>

1621
01:12:16.090 --> 01:12:19.680
<v Speaker 6>he is a hero figure in this culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when I look at that,</v>

1622
01:12:19.681 --> 01:12:21.590
<v Speaker 6>it's a little like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1623
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:24.900
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in those tribes where they take a maiden</v>

1624
01:12:24.901 --> 01:12:25.734
<v Speaker 6>and they honor for a year and then they </v>
<v Speaker 6>boil her or throw her off a cliff or </v>

1625
01:12:28.681 --> 01:12:30.570
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1626
01:12:30.571 --> 01:12:34.770
<v Speaker 6>I'm not the Donald Trump myth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not Donald Trump.</v>

1627
01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:37.140
<v Speaker 6>He's just a porsche slump that's caught </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the.</v>

1628
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:42.470
<v Speaker 6>He's been selected to play out the myth </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he gets the feeling of,</v>

1629
01:12:42.751 --> 01:12:44.040
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm Donald Trump.</v>

1630
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:46.590
<v Speaker 6>Enjoy baby.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can have it.</v>

1631
01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:52.950
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Donald Trump,</v>

1632
01:12:52.951 --> 01:12:53.784
<v Speaker 6>this is an obscenity because how much </v>
<v Speaker 6>the person close their heart to keep so </v>

1633
01:12:58.111 --> 01:13:02.250
<v Speaker 6>single minded on that while all around </v>
<v Speaker 6>them are the have nots.</v>

1634
01:13:02.251 --> 01:13:03.084
<v Speaker 6>And the people that are falling by the </v>
<v Speaker 6>wayside just because of the way he is </v>

1635
01:13:06.421 --> 01:13:07.254
<v Speaker 6>living.</v>

1636
01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:09.483
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird argument just because of </v>

1637
01:13:13.691 --> 01:13:16.930
<v Speaker 2>the way he is living because he is </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in an opulent life.</v>

1638
01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.880
<v Speaker 2>But if he wasn't living in an opulent </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

1639
01:13:19.330 --> 01:13:20.163
<v Speaker 2>the resources required to make him live </v>
<v Speaker 2>an opulent life would only help a </v>

1640
01:13:23.321 --> 01:13:26.800
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'd be a great number of people that</v>

1641
01:13:26.801 --> 01:13:29.710
<v Speaker 2>would still be left in absolute poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

1642
01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:31.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that argument because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

1643
01:13:31.691 --> 01:13:33.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that that's what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1644
01:13:33.191 --> 01:13:37.000
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a game going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he is completely invested in the</v>

1645
01:13:37.001 --> 01:13:41.500
<v Speaker 2>game and that game is acquiring money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acquiring wealth and fame,</v>

1646
01:13:41.501 --> 01:13:43.600
<v Speaker 2>and he's really good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's his game.</v>

1647
01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:45.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't really produce anything else,</v>

1648
01:13:45.581 --> 01:13:47.770
<v Speaker 2>especially now that he's not the host of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the apprentice anymore.</v>

1649
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.611
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1650
01:13:48.611 --> 01:13:52.780
<v Speaker 2>he's the executive producer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean without him doing that,</v>

1651
01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:54.700
<v Speaker 2>arguably he's producing.</v>

1652
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.280
<v Speaker 2>And I use this very loosely art because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

1653
01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:00.173
<v Speaker 2>You're watching the program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I like about what he's saying is </v>

1654
01:14:02.351 --> 01:14:03.184
<v Speaker 2>he's just kind of stuck in the Donald </v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump that somebody has to play that </v>

1655
01:14:06.551 --> 01:14:07.450
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the villain.</v>

1656
01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:08.433
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think he's doing anything </v>

1657
01:14:09.641 --> 01:14:13.090
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't really.</v>

1658
01:14:13.091 --> 01:14:16.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe is business wise maybe is how many</v>

1659
01:14:16.991 --> 01:14:18.490
<v Speaker 2>cars do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1660
01:14:18.491 --> 01:14:19.324
<v Speaker 2>Like when a holy man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you find out a holy man has 15 </v>

1661
01:14:21.131 --> 01:14:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Mercedes Benz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who owns a bikram yoga,</v>

1662
01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:25.210
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1663
01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:27.900
<v Speaker 2>He owns like all these hate what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened with him.</v>

1664
01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:30.190
<v Speaker 2>But we see these other guys playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>these other roles going.</v>

1665
01:14:30.191 --> 01:14:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Like of course he has five helicopters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is,</v>

1666
01:14:31.971 --> 01:14:33.820
<v Speaker 2>he's a billionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He do,</v>

1667
01:14:33.821 --> 01:14:34.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy's deal.</v>

1668
01:14:34.631 --> 01:14:35.464
<v Speaker 2>It's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was being tried for tax evasion </v>

1669
01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.220
<v Speaker 2>apparently.</v>

1670
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.180
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1671
01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.373
<v Speaker 2>they found all these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had all these Ferrari's and bentleys </v>

1672
01:14:43.751 --> 01:14:44.584
<v Speaker 2>and shit and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his claim was that he was starting a </v>

1673
01:14:47.711 --> 01:14:51.880
<v Speaker 2>school for children and how to repair </v>
<v Speaker 2>automobiles.</v>

1674
01:14:51.881 --> 01:14:52.714
<v Speaker 2>So that's why he got these cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good alternative facts right </v>

1675
01:14:55.661 --> 01:14:56.260
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1676
01:14:56.260 --> 01:15:00.280
<v Speaker 2>that's almost beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such a unique case,</v>

1677
01:15:00.281 --> 01:15:01.114
<v Speaker 2>that beacon guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they did an hbo real sports </v>

1678
01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:05.210
<v Speaker 2>about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it.</v>

1679
01:15:05.230 --> 01:15:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to see that fucking insane.</v>

1680
01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.020
<v Speaker 2>He's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to write that down.</v>

1681
01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:15.180
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about these women that </v>
<v Speaker 2>beat from Hud Noi,</v>

1682
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:18.910
<v Speaker 2>Noi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He changed his name to hot yoga,</v>

1683
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Bikram Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last name,</v>

1684
01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:23.470
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1685
01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:24.813
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1686
01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:29.910
<v Speaker 2>he was addressing these allegations of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual assault and he said,</v>

1687
01:15:30.011 --> 01:15:33.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that women will give $1,000,000</v>

1688
01:15:33.491 --> 01:15:35.860
<v Speaker 2>for one drop of my sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1689
01:15:35.861 --> 01:15:37.540
<v Speaker 2>that's what he was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

1690
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:37.840
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1691
01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.010
<v Speaker 2>The woman who was interviewing me was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1692
01:15:39.011 --> 01:15:40.250
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1693
01:15:40.690 --> 01:15:43.030
<v Speaker 2>One drop of my sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>$1,000,000.</v>

1694
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:46.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like oil.</v>

1695
01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:48.970
<v Speaker 2>We think maybe that does replenish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could really make a lot of money.</v>

1696
01:15:48.971 --> 01:15:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Imagine just a line of Petri dishes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>him just grabbing his cock,</v>

1697
01:15:53.171 --> 01:15:56.470
<v Speaker 2>like a bent garden hose and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>dripping out little drops.</v>

1698
01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.270
<v Speaker 2>One million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1 million,</v>

1699
01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:00.730
<v Speaker 2>1 million pip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pip.</v>

1700
01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:03.350
<v Speaker 2>About a billion dollars off my stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1701
01:16:03.370 --> 01:16:04.203
<v Speaker 2>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the guy that's responsible for </v>

1702
01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:08.764
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really so it's so interesting </v>

1703
01:16:10.271 --> 01:16:13.660
<v Speaker 2>because it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kind of embodies what's bizarre about</v>

1704
01:16:13.661 --> 01:16:14.494
<v Speaker 2>human beings because this guy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for so many people's </v>

1705
01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:21.730
<v Speaker 2>personal growth and enlightenment by him</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing yoga and hot yoga to the United</v>

1706
01:16:21.730 --> 01:16:22.563
<v Speaker 2>States and making it so popular of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>this force because perhaps because of </v>

1707
01:16:25.691 --> 01:16:26.524
<v Speaker 2>his ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of his desire to achieve fame </v>

1708
01:16:30.071 --> 01:16:32.410
<v Speaker 2>and fortune and all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that he has gotten,</v>

1709
01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:36.460
<v Speaker 2>he's also spread this thing that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazingly beneficial to people,</v>

1710
01:16:36.461 --> 01:16:40.750
<v Speaker 2>which has in turn fueled his self </v>
<v Speaker 2>righteous indignation.</v>

1711
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:42.790
<v Speaker 2>It's actually kind of goes back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rioting.</v>

1712
01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:43.893
<v Speaker 2>Aride is a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy being an asshole is a bad </v>

1713
01:16:45.790 --> 01:16:47.410
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a bad thing.</v>

1714
01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Almost hoping to do a good thing or </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a bad thing that also does.</v>

1715
01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever met somebody that's a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of shit,</v>

1716
01:16:56.051 --> 01:16:56.884
<v Speaker 2>but they also do a lot of charity work </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the charity work sort of masks the </v>

1717
01:17:00.401 --> 01:17:01.234
<v Speaker 2>fact they're a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was one of the things about </v>

1718
01:17:03.090 --> 01:17:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Sandusky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Send Dusky was this.</v>

1719
01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:06.723
<v Speaker 2>One of the things about him is that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was molesting all boys that he was </v>

1720
01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:13.250
<v Speaker 2>helping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he ran this charity for boys and then</v>

1721
01:17:13.251 --> 01:17:18.251
<v Speaker 2>he was fucking horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something that people do.</v>

1722
01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:21.050
<v Speaker 2>They run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll do something where they're doing</v>

1723
01:17:21.051 --> 01:17:21.884
<v Speaker 2>something very charitable sorta to mask </v>
<v Speaker 2>how shitty their our or to justify who </v>

1724
01:17:25.731 --> 01:17:30.020
<v Speaker 2>they are and there is someone in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of fucked up scenario that did just</v>

1725
01:17:30.021 --> 01:17:30.854
<v Speaker 2>benefit.</v>

1726
01:17:30.930 --> 01:17:31.763
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's someone who just benefited from </v>

1727
01:17:33.051 --> 01:17:36.080
<v Speaker 2>that and no one evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1728
01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:36.953
<v Speaker 2>underlined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the strange paradoxes of </v>

1729
01:17:38.901 --> 01:17:39.734
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the weird things that we have to </v>

1730
01:17:40.491 --> 01:17:41.324
<v Speaker 2>deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings are capable of so many </v>

1731
01:17:43.011 --> 01:17:43.844
<v Speaker 2>weird rationalizations and this is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the diffusion of responsibility </v>

1732
01:17:47.451 --> 01:17:49.940
<v Speaker 2>thing that happens in mob mentalities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1733
01:17:49.941 --> 01:17:50.760
<v Speaker 2>with all I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1734
01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.010
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've felt it.</v>

1735
01:17:52.011 --> 01:17:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it before where people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>running around hitting people.</v>

1736
01:17:54.621 --> 01:17:57.430
<v Speaker 2>And when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked as a,</v>

1737
01:17:57.431 --> 01:17:58.264
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a security guard at this place called </v>

1752
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:35.303
<v Speaker 2>barrel of cash behind my favorite Rodney</v>
<v Speaker 2>days because Rodney used to go on stage </v>

<v Speaker 2>naked with a bathrobe on.</v>

<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1755
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:47.100
<v Speaker 2>He decided that he was going to perform </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a bathrobe on until he.</v>

1756
01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:51.080
<v Speaker 2>And he has like a fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't make just what I'm doing it.</v>

1757
01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:52.760
<v Speaker 2>That's what he felt like doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liked it.</v>

1758
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Like that feeling I like and he's naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was naked.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Could you see as Peccadillo you can be </v>

1760
01:18:58.130 --> 01:19:02.070
<v Speaker 2>guys who were working backstage saws hog</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's like his bathrobe.</v>

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.120
<v Speaker 2>So he didn't give me all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I put it on the sea of people who </v>

1764
01:19:06.711 --> 01:19:07.690
<v Speaker 2>respect me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1765
01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:10.790
<v Speaker 2>I just think he literally didn't give </v>
<v Speaker 2>any fucks.</v>

1766
01:19:10.970 --> 01:19:11.803
<v Speaker 2>Zero fucks left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was deep into his sixties and he </v>

1767
01:19:15.471 --> 01:19:18.380
<v Speaker 2>would go onstage with a bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my dad.</v>

1768
01:19:18.730 --> 01:19:23.480
<v Speaker 2>I've seen my dad's Dick more now than </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid because he doesn't give</v>

1769
01:19:23.481 --> 01:19:27.950
<v Speaker 2>a shit how my dad isn't deaf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just doesn't listen.</v>

1770
01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Like he literally don't care because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to listen to him.</v>

1771
01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:32.870
<v Speaker 2>I told my dad to get a hearing aid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

1772
01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:33.883
<v Speaker 2>what could you be saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then resumed watching jeopardy on </v>

1773
01:19:37.641 --> 01:19:42.170
<v Speaker 2>100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that what could you be saying in a</v>

1774
01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:43.004
<v Speaker 2>row?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm sure he was in a row but it </v>

1775
01:19:43.761 --> 01:19:44.690
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1776
01:19:44.691 --> 01:19:47.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there and a riot brought out,</v>

1777
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:50.110
<v Speaker 2>broke out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was working and I was in the um,</v>

1778
01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:51.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

1779
01:19:51.770 --> 01:19:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Great Woods has a lawn for people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

1780
01:19:54.861 --> 01:19:58.670
<v Speaker 2>It's an outside area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So part of it is under like a roof.</v>

1781
01:19:58.910 --> 01:20:03.890
<v Speaker 2>And then there's this back lawn area and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neil young was playing and uh,</v>

1782
01:20:03.891 --> 01:20:04.724
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking stoners and burnouts were there </v>

1783
01:20:07.471 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 2>for Neil young</v>

1784
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:08.993
<v Speaker 4>and they started fires.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They started like little these little </v>

1785
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:15.870
<v Speaker 4>campfires lighting papers on fire and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>had to break it up.</v>

1786
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:16.853
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a Hoodie that I brought with me </v>

1787
01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:22.500
<v Speaker 4>because I always knew I'd seen a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fights and I,</v>

1788
01:20:22.501 --> 01:20:23.334
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of altercations and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>saw one of the security guards beat the </v>

1789
01:20:26.641 --> 01:20:27.474
<v Speaker 4>shit out of this guy because he stole </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the golf course and they hit him </v>

1790
01:20:29.551 --> 01:20:31.860
<v Speaker 4>over the head with a radio was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>craziness.</v>

1791
01:20:31.861 --> 01:20:34.260
<v Speaker 4>I saw craziness at that place and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>always like,</v>

1792
01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:37.740
<v Speaker 4>this is not worth $10 an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's a good job.</v>

1793
01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:39.750
<v Speaker 4>Like to have when you're 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 bucks an hour.</v>

1794
01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:40.231
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1795
01:20:40.231 --> 01:20:41.900
<v Speaker 4>I got some good money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was good,</v>

1796
01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.610
<v Speaker 4>but it was legitimately physically </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>

1797
01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:47.010
<v Speaker 4>And I was working with a bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 4>black belts.</v>

1798
01:20:47.011 --> 01:20:50.400
<v Speaker 4>It was all like martial arts guys that </v>
<v Speaker 4>were working there as a security people.</v>

1799
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:51.833
<v Speaker 4>And I was a at the back area where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fires were and we were told to go put </v>

1800
01:20:57.361 --> 01:20:59.810
<v Speaker 4>the fires out and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1801
01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.620
<v Speaker 4>there's radios were going off like when </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are fires,</v>

1802
01:21:02.621 --> 01:21:03.454
<v Speaker 4>we're going to break out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>

1803
01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:04.710
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they canceled the show,</v>

1804
01:21:04.711 --> 01:21:07.440
<v Speaker 4>they stopped the show in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the concert because of the fires.</v>

1805
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:10.140
<v Speaker 4>And then fights started breaking out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put the Hoodie up,</v>

1806
01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:11.053
<v Speaker 4>a zipped it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put it over my security outfit and walk </v>

1807
01:21:13.051 --> 01:21:15.870
<v Speaker 4>right out the door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck this,</v>

1808
01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:16.704
<v Speaker 4>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it had gotten to that weird </v>

1809
01:21:18.481 --> 01:21:20.020
<v Speaker 4>place where like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1810
01:21:20.050 --> 01:21:22.980
<v Speaker 4>I saw my friend Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's like one of the most peaceful,</v>

1811
01:21:22.981 --> 01:21:25.800
<v Speaker 4>friendly guys in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>told this guy to put down,</v>

<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>

1815
01:21:29.641 --> 01:21:32.460

<v Speaker 4>in the stomach and dropped them.</v>

1818
01:21:41.581 --> 01:21:43.580
<v Speaker 4>quit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See in life we need a larry.</v>

1819
01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:44.513
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need a canary in the coal mine that </v>

1820
01:21:45.481 --> 01:21:47.280
<v Speaker 4>you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If Larry's throwing blows,</v>

1821
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:48.143
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was like the sweetest guy in the </v>

1822
01:21:48.541 --> 01:21:49.410
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get the fuck.</v>

1823
01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was a trained killer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was like a super sweet guy.</v>

1824
01:21:52.141 --> 01:21:52.974
<v Speaker 4>So if him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he got to the point where he was so </v>

1825
01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.910
<v Speaker 4>on edge that he punched this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1826
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:57.833
<v Speaker 4>there's no way I'm fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy might've called him a nigger or </v>

1827
01:22:00.421 --> 01:22:01.590
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>

1828
01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:05.160
<v Speaker 4>there was so much chaos going on because</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was black and the guy was white,</v>

1829
01:22:05.161 --> 01:22:07.320
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he blast this guy and I'm like,</v>

1830
01:22:07.321 --> 01:22:09.630
<v Speaker 4>if Larry's Hinton people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this fucking show's over.</v>

1831
01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:11.090
<v Speaker 4>And then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1832
01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:12.590
<v Speaker 4>we heard something over the loud </v>
<v Speaker 4>speaker,</v>

1833
01:22:12.591 --> 01:22:15.030
<v Speaker 4>but the show stopping and people were </v>
<v Speaker 4>going crazy.</v>

1834
01:22:15.031 --> 01:22:18.450
<v Speaker 4>We can no longer rock in the free world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there was this feeling.</v>

1835
01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:22.950
<v Speaker 4>It was this feeling in the air of like </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible things can happen for sure.</v>

1836
01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:23.813
<v Speaker 4>There was this feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get trampled where people are </v>

1837
01:22:27.661 --> 01:22:28.510
<v Speaker 4>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1838
01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:31.290
<v Speaker 4>not people anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not you and one person.</v>

1839
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:33.330
<v Speaker 4>So if it's like me and this other </v>
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>

1840
01:22:33.331 --> 01:22:33.871
<v Speaker 4>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

1841
01:22:33.871 --> 01:22:35.370
<v Speaker 4>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we don't have to start this fire.</v>

1842
01:22:35.490 --> 01:22:36.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>

1843
01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:37.513
<v Speaker 4>Have a good night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That day when I got home I ordered like </v>

1844
01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:43.020
<v Speaker 4>two months worth of earthquake food and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1845
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:47.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't like what we become when shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes sideways.</v>

1846
01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.240
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we kind of.</v>

1847
01:22:48.850 --> 01:22:52.380
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that studies have </v>
<v Speaker 4>shown is that in natural disasters,</v>

1848
01:22:52.381 --> 01:22:53.214
<v Speaker 4>people come together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they come together and support each </v>

1849
01:22:54.631 --> 01:22:55.464
<v Speaker 4>other and help each other.</v>

1850
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:56.790
<v Speaker 4>It's common,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really true.</v>

1851
01:22:57.150 --> 01:22:58.890
<v Speaker 4>But that the blackouts in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

1852
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:59.783
<v Speaker 4>It helps people help each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really like some of the best </v>

1853
01:23:02.611 --> 01:23:03.444
<v Speaker 4>aspects of human beings do come out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What scares me is not that what scares </v>

1854
01:23:07.091 --> 01:23:07.924
<v Speaker 4>me is these unique moments where </v>
<v Speaker 4>violence breaks out and there's groups </v>

1855
01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:11.824
<v Speaker 4>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's because I feel like there's a </v>

1856
01:23:13.151 --> 01:23:13.984
<v Speaker 4>genetic memory that we have that's from </v>
<v Speaker 4>war one on one hand to hand combat </v>

1857
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:23.470
<v Speaker 4>warfare because our ancestors for </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years fought like that.</v>

1858
01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:27.250
<v Speaker 4>They fought in these chaotic battles </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you didn't know who the enemy was.</v>

1859
01:23:27.251 --> 01:23:28.720
<v Speaker 4>You're swinging an ax,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1860
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:33.750
<v Speaker 4>That is so ingrained in our genetic </v>
<v Speaker 4>memory that I think when these riot type</v>

1861
01:23:33.881 --> 01:23:34.714
<v Speaker 4>situations break out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when that guy sprayed that girl in </v>

1862
01:23:36.341 --> 01:23:38.560
<v Speaker 4>the face or hit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they feel like that's the enemy.</v>

1863
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:39.783
<v Speaker 4>There's this instinct to just start </v>
<v Speaker 4>swinging at people that are on another </v>

1864
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:42.810
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>

1865
01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:45.090
<v Speaker 4>It's in our bones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1866
01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:47.380
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a terrible thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultivate.</v>

1867
01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:50.650
<v Speaker 4>It's a fairy and so in order like when </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>

1868
01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:53.380
<v Speaker 4>when you're establishing us versus them </v>
<v Speaker 4>narratives,</v>

1869
01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:54.453
<v Speaker 4>I think you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You set an incredibly dangerous </v>

1870
01:23:55.811 --> 01:23:59.050
<v Speaker 4>precedent because I think you tap in </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancient genetic memory.</v>

1871
01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.880
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm trying to say it's not us</v>
<v Speaker 4>and them.</v>

1872
01:24:00.881 --> 01:24:02.650
<v Speaker 4>I know it just sounds like hippie </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonsense,</v>

1873
01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.513
<v Speaker 4>but you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put it is send us in the stake of the </v>

1874
01:24:06.131 --> 01:24:09.190
<v Speaker 4>sixties was when the hippies were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's us and it's them.</v>

1875
01:24:09.370 --> 01:24:10.203
<v Speaker 4>We need to get them when it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When really we always need to be </v>

1876
01:24:12.281 --> 01:24:13.600
<v Speaker 4>remembering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all of us,</v>

1877
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:16.420
<v Speaker 4>which is why it's a real problem when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you just want to.</v>

1878
01:24:16.450 --> 01:24:18.610
<v Speaker 4>When you simply put a label on </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

1879
01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:19.610
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's in knots.</v>

1880
01:24:19.630 --> 01:24:19.990
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1881
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:22.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these definitely not a Nazi Punch Nazis.</v>

1882
01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.710
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>

1883
01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:25.240
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not a Nazi.</v>

1884
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:27.730
<v Speaker 4>You're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And second of all,</v>

1885
01:24:27.731 --> 01:24:30.730
<v Speaker 4>if he was a Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck does someone become a Nazi?</v>

1886
01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:31.803
<v Speaker 4>How does someone become now like we </v>
<v Speaker 4>should probably figure out what makes a </v>

1887
01:24:34.271 --> 01:24:36.290
<v Speaker 4>person like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that you just going to fix them</v>

1888
01:24:36.291 --> 01:24:37.300
<v Speaker 4>by punching them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1889
01:24:37.301 --> 01:24:39.730
<v Speaker 4>you're going to start a goddamn war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to get.</v>

1890
01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:40.693
<v Speaker 4>His name is Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm trying to get an x white </v>

1891
01:24:42.401 --> 01:24:45.700
<v Speaker 4>supremacists to come on just for what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're saying.</v>

1892
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:46.743
<v Speaker 4>I think podcasting can be powerful and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to have people that can offer </v>

1893
01:24:49.901 --> 01:24:50.734
<v Speaker 4>perspectives that you know aren't great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'd like to talk to somebody that's </v>

1894
01:24:54.371 --> 01:24:55.690
<v Speaker 4>reformed in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1895
01:24:55.691 --> 01:24:56.524
<v Speaker 4>long form conversations do reveal </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain aspects of people and you were </v>

1896
01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:03.550
<v Speaker 4>starving for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult to tap into,</v>

1897
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:04.663
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're doing seven minutes on a late </v>

1898
01:25:05.921 --> 01:25:09.280
<v Speaker 4>night show like Conan or something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and you see sometimes people do.</v>

1899
01:25:09.610 --> 01:25:11.980
<v Speaker 4>They sort of breach these controversial </v>
<v Speaker 4>issues and he like,</v>

1900
01:25:11.981 --> 01:25:12.791
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>

1901
01:25:12.791 --> 01:25:16.330
<v Speaker 4>you can't really do that service.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right in the next 45 seconds.</v>

1902
01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:20.480
<v Speaker 4>I also love it because sometimes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>joke has a two hour setup.</v>

1903
01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:22.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those episodes,</v>

1904
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:24.580
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

1905
01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:25.653
<v Speaker 4>It was like three tornadoes converging </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the end and we didn't know you and I </v>

1906
01:25:29.651 --> 01:25:32.260
<v Speaker 4>as stand ups or from a world where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to get a laugh.</v>

1907
01:25:32.261 --> 01:25:34.060
<v Speaker 4>They have 30,</v>
<v Speaker 4>40 seconds or whatever.</v>

1908
01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.760
<v Speaker 4>I've had some of the funniest things </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever happen.</v>

1909
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:40.430
<v Speaker 4>Two hours into a podcast and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even funny up until the end.</v>

1910
01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:41.740
<v Speaker 4>Until the end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1911
01:25:41.741 --> 01:25:43.090
<v Speaker 4>Oh definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>

1912
01:25:43.091 --> 01:25:46.510
<v Speaker 4>And also when you're two hours into it </v>
<v Speaker 4>with another person,</v>

1913
01:25:46.511 --> 01:25:49.120
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I haven't had long conversations</v>

1914
01:25:49.121 --> 01:25:49.954
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when we're having this long </v>

1915
01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:51.244
<v Speaker 4>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get to sort of explore how you think </v>

1916
01:25:52.691 --> 01:25:53.524
<v Speaker 4>about things and you look at things and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get to see how I do and we compare </v>

1917
01:25:57.161 --> 01:25:58.930
<v Speaker 4>notes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we compare ideas and then,</v>

1918
01:25:58.931 --> 01:26:01.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my idea is get enriched your ideas,</v>

1919
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.870
<v Speaker 4>getting enriched.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1920
01:26:02.110 --> 01:26:03.920
<v Speaker 4>Sort of come together and this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>

1921
01:26:03.921 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1922
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:06.080
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there again,</v>

1923
01:26:06.081 --> 01:26:09.200
<v Speaker 1>it kinda goes back to my google thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like boredom is good.</v>

1924
01:26:09.201 --> 01:26:10.034
<v Speaker 1>How I had so many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mapped out the whole worlds and ideas </v>

1925
01:26:14.631 --> 01:26:17.570
<v Speaker 1>and moving ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a kid because I was bored as shit</v>

1926
01:26:17.571 --> 01:26:19.700
<v Speaker 1>when I see the screens in the back of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the head rest.</v>

1927
01:26:19.701 --> 01:26:21.830
<v Speaker 1>So the SUV is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1928
01:26:21.831 --> 01:26:22.664
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have kids and maybe that is </v>

1929
01:26:23.751 --> 01:26:24.584
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to be like shut the fuck </v>

1930
01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:27.110
<v Speaker 1>up and watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We there yet.</v>

1931
01:26:27.111 --> 01:26:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Are we there yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we there?</v>

1932
01:26:28.571 --> 01:26:32.900
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to watch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frozen but frozen on everybody.</v>

1933
01:26:32.901 --> 01:26:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Cheers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was calm.</v>

1934
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:35.930
<v Speaker 1>What is lost?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is something,</v>

1935
01:26:35.931 --> 01:26:36.764
<v Speaker 1>some people do well with boredom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a summer camp where there was </v>

1936
01:26:38.751 --> 01:26:41.330
<v Speaker 1>nothing and that's when I started doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>improv.</v>

1937
01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:42.463
<v Speaker 1>Well one thing for those kinds of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could put on educational programs </v>

1938
01:26:45.381 --> 01:26:48.140
<v Speaker 1>for kids and they actually do enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for.</v>

1939
01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I put on nature shows for my kids all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

1940
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:52.040
<v Speaker 1>They enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1941
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:53.263
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to engineer like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say boredom engineer's certain </v>

1942
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:59.750
<v Speaker 1>amount of time in your life when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>free from all that stuff,</v>

1943
01:26:59.751 --> 01:27:00.710
<v Speaker 1>put your phone away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1944
01:27:00.711 --> 01:27:02.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the Japanese word for it?</v>

1945
01:27:02.421 --> 01:27:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm forgetting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a value that they have.</v>

1946
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:07.010
<v Speaker 1>The word means emptiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like time.</v>

1947
01:27:07.011 --> 01:27:09.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not meditating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not contemplating.</v>

1948
01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:10.753
<v Speaker 1>It's just all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For this hour I'm just going to be open </v>

1949
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:16.640
<v Speaker 1>and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's essential.</v>

1950
01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:19.340
<v Speaker 1>We don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's we're jammed up,</v>

1951
01:27:19.341 --> 01:27:22.290
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're jammed up and even more oil,</v>

1952
01:27:24.670 --> 01:27:25.503
<v Speaker 1>even more so jammed up when you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>more obligations and you have a family </v>

1953
01:27:28.431 --> 01:27:30.590
<v Speaker 1>and you have a job and you have careers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1954
01:27:30.591 --> 01:27:31.424
<v Speaker 1>you have a podcast and you're also stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and you're also doing a television </v>

1955
01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:34.633
<v Speaker 1>show with a fan because I just got </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged and we're thinking about having </v>

1956
01:27:37.431 --> 01:27:38.150
<v Speaker 1>kids and stuff.</v>

1957
01:27:38.150 --> 01:27:39.980
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons I want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>married.</v>

1958
01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:43.850
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you find it managing because your</v>

1959
01:27:43.851 --> 01:27:47.690
<v Speaker 1>business is you and your life and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and your ideas.</v>

1960
01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:48.920
<v Speaker 1>I manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1961
01:27:48.921 --> 01:27:49.754
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it requires thought and work and </v>

1962
01:27:51.591 --> 01:27:52.424
<v Speaker 1>effort and it takes away from some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that I would want to do more </v>

1963
01:27:55.731 --> 01:27:57.590
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to shorter,</v>

1964
01:27:57.950 --> 01:27:58.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis Ck.</v>

1965
01:27:58.730 --> 01:28:02.330
<v Speaker 1>I had a great quote about being dad once</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought was really cool because I read</v>

1966
01:28:02.331 --> 01:28:06.290
<v Speaker 1>it after I'd already sort of absorbed it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he and I read him saying,</v>

1967
01:28:06.291 --> 01:28:07.250
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1968
01:28:07.251 --> 01:28:08.630
<v Speaker 1>he's so right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>

1969
01:28:08.631 --> 01:28:10.950
<v Speaker 1>let it change you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1970
01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:12.890
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great way.</v>

1971
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Great way to describe it and not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>resist.</v>

1972
01:28:15.370 --> 01:28:16.203
<v Speaker 1>I think that because I know guys that do</v>
<v Speaker 1>resist and they wind up getting </v>

1973
01:28:17.961 --> 01:28:18.794
<v Speaker 1>divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to be in Shitty dads and they </v>

1974
01:28:20.451 --> 01:28:21.310
<v Speaker 1>wind up being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1975
01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:24.260
<v Speaker 1>dad's divorce don't resist because my </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife left me.</v>

1976
01:28:24.261 --> 01:28:27.550
<v Speaker 1>That's what my hbo show is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What your first wife left you for?</v>

1977
01:28:27.570 --> 01:28:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Jumping right back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at you.</v>

1978
01:28:29.790 --> 01:28:31.880
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was 10 years too soon.</v>

1979
01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Too soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old are you?</v>

1980
01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm 37.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got married when I was 22.</v>

1981
01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that would work.</v>

1982
01:28:37.630 --> 01:28:38.463
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

1983
01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:43.550
<v Speaker 1>I went to a Christian college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a proper youth ministry.</v>

1984
01:28:43.551 --> 01:28:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Major.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris.</v>

1985
01:28:45.090 --> 01:28:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the show is about,</v>

1986
01:28:46.101 --> 01:28:46.934
<v Speaker 1>is about a religious guy whose wife </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves and then this is kind of what </v>

1987
01:28:49.881 --> 01:28:50.714
<v Speaker 1>happened in my real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got kicked into the deep end of the </v>

1988
01:28:52.521 --> 01:28:56.330
<v Speaker 1>comedy scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people like Tj Miller and Nick Kroll,</v>

1989
01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:59.720
<v Speaker 1>John Malaney like rescued me when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have anywhere to go.</v>

1990
01:28:59.930 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 1>So on the show it's fictionalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>version</v>

1991
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.903
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every episode I'm crashing on the couch </v>

1992
01:29:04.411 --> 01:29:06.060
<v Speaker 3>of a different comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1993
01:29:06.061 --> 01:29:10.230
<v Speaker 3>So you were 22.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're hardcore Christian.</v>

1994
01:29:10.231 --> 01:29:12.200
<v Speaker 3>You meet this Gal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's hardcore Christian to.</v>

1995
01:29:12.201 --> 01:29:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long were you married?</v>

1996
01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:16.890
<v Speaker 3>I was married for six years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We dated for about a year and a half.</v>

1997
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:19.620
<v Speaker 3>This is a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew we were going to get married when</v>

1998
01:29:19.621 --> 01:29:23.220
<v Speaker 3>she went down on me because I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was like,</v>

1999
01:29:23.250 --> 01:29:25.230
<v Speaker 3>you don't do that with someone you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to marry.</v>

2000
01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:30.700
<v Speaker 3>And it was I wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was our engagement blow job.</v>

2001
01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:32.130
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On bended knee.</v>

2002
01:29:32.370 --> 01:29:36.600
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were married and then what happened?</v>

2003
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.950
<v Speaker 3>How did it go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what's interesting is,</v>

2004
01:29:38.951 --> 01:29:39.784
<v Speaker 3>is talking about letting it change you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember before I had experienced any </v>

2005
01:29:43.051 --> 01:29:43.884
<v Speaker 3>sort of suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a pretty charmed life and then I </v>

2006
01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:49.800
<v Speaker 3>experienced some pretty severe pain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2007
01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:52.260
<v Speaker 3>and that's when I started to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>who I was,</v>

2008
01:29:52.261 --> 01:29:55.110
<v Speaker 3>what I cared about and what I actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought was funny.</v>

2009
01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:56.303
<v Speaker 3>So it turned out this is very unlikely </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing made me into a much better </v>

2010
01:29:59.251 --> 01:30:01.290
<v Speaker 3>comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus I had way more free time.</v>

2011
01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:02.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well for sure.</v>

2012
01:30:02.251 --> 01:30:04.620
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna make you a better comedian if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could survive it.</v>

2013
01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:08.610
<v Speaker 3>Like anything that's rough emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes you a better comic if you survive.</v>

2014
01:30:08.611 --> 01:30:09.444
<v Speaker 3>That's what already already laying is in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pilot and he's in a couple of the </v>

2015
01:30:11.371 --> 01:30:14.190
<v Speaker 3>other episodes as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's amazing and he's like,</v>

2016
01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:15.330
<v Speaker 3>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

2017
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:17.300
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife left me funny now.</v>

2018
01:30:17.690 --> 01:30:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Used to just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of cute observational stuff.</v>

2019
01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:21.660
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a man now.</v>

2020
01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:23.540
<v Speaker 3>Shit happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

2021
01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:24.413
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2022
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:26.190
<v Speaker 3>I stabbed myself in the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Funny.</v>

2023
01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:28.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he hit his heart?</v>

2024
01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:31.230
<v Speaker 3>He's trying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stabbed himself in the chest.</v>

2025
01:30:31.650 --> 01:30:34.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be at the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems to be doing better.</v>

2026
01:30:34.261 --> 01:30:35.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean already.</v>

2027
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:36.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2032
01:30:44.190 --> 01:30:45.930
<v Speaker 3>improvised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed it.</v>

2033
01:30:46.230 --> 01:30:48.690
<v Speaker 3>He's a huge part of why the show got so </v>
<v Speaker 3>funny.</v>

2034

<v Speaker 3>This is all names.</v>

2045
01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:16.693
<v Speaker 3>Rocco sounds like a bad play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She fucked a boxer named rocky and I </v>

2046
01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:22.050
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't,</v>

2047
01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:23.870
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't a bad guy who used to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>each,</v>

2048
01:31:23.970 --> 01:31:25.500
<v Speaker 3>like we'd get along and stuff.</v>

2049
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:27.810
<v Speaker 3>And then how long was he banging her for</v>
<v Speaker 3>before you found out?</v>

2050
01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:29.153
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's actually because we moved </v>

2051
01:31:29.611 --> 01:31:30.870
<v Speaker 3>upstate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2052
01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:32.213
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of elements to the story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we moved upstate because she was a </v>

2053
01:31:33.901 --> 01:31:36.300
<v Speaker 3>country mouse and I'm a city boy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then we were like,</v>

2054
01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:38.100
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just live in this episode of green</v>

2055
01:31:38.101 --> 01:31:41.400
<v Speaker 3>acres.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just live in sleepy hollow,</v>

2056
01:31:41.610 --> 01:31:42.443
<v Speaker 3>right behind the cemetery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so terrifying and I just felt </v>

2057
01:31:45.901 --> 01:31:46.734
<v Speaker 3>this distance between us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought it was because she'd get </v>

2058
01:31:49.231 --> 01:31:52.380
<v Speaker 3>home at like 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'd leave at like five,</v>

2059
01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.960
<v Speaker 3>6:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get into the city and time to do like</v>

2060
01:31:54.961 --> 01:31:56.560
<v Speaker 3>five minutes at some shitty open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike.</v>

2061
01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:59.010
<v Speaker 3>So how far away did you live in the city</v>
<v Speaker 3>square and seeing each other?</v>

2062
01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:00.093
<v Speaker 3>Sleepy hollow is only about 45 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe if you're trying to lived in </v>

2063
01:32:02.411 --> 01:32:03.780
<v Speaker 3>sleepy hollow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2064
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:06.743
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it the sleepy hollow where the story </v>

2065
01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:10.633
<v Speaker 3>came from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2066
01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:12.910
<v Speaker 3>I believe that does a lot of sleepy </v>
<v Speaker 3>hollow's right?</v>

2067
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.160
<v Speaker 3>That uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that author I forget,</v>

2068
01:32:15.161 --> 01:32:19.270
<v Speaker 3>is it or I forget who wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember who,</v>

2069
01:32:19.271 --> 01:32:20.104
<v Speaker 3>but I'm a dummy and I lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe he was buried behind my house </v>

2070
01:32:23.250 --> 01:32:27.460
<v Speaker 3>and I lived on Gory Brook road chain was</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things that are happening that</v>

2071
01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:30.690
<v Speaker 3>made it seem like a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally would lay on the bed because</v>

2072
01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:33.430
<v Speaker 3>she's not there for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's having an affair.</v>

2073
01:32:33.431 --> 01:32:37.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't know because I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the last thing on my mind.</v>

2074
01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I thought I was dead.</v>

2075
01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:40.953
<v Speaker 3>I thought I had died and gone to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of weird purgatory because you're </v>

2076
01:32:43.211 --> 01:32:48.211
<v Speaker 3>in this new place and your small town </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's distant from you and you're by</v>

2077
01:32:48.941 --> 01:32:53.320
<v Speaker 3>yourself up the steepest hill to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>home from a fucking metro north.</v>

2078
01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:57.790
<v Speaker 3>It took an hour and a half round trip to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do five minutes at UCB and I'd come home</v>

2079
01:32:57.791 --> 01:33:00.070
<v Speaker 3>and she's asleep and I just like get </v>
<v Speaker 3>drunk.</v>

2080
01:33:00.071 --> 01:33:02.740
<v Speaker 3>I was so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I thought I was dying.</v>

2081
01:33:02.741 --> 01:33:03.070
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2082
01:33:03.070 --> 01:33:07.060
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'll tell you a story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One time when she was having the affair,</v>

2083
01:33:07.061 --> 01:33:11.050
<v Speaker 3>I called her and she answered the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was acting really,</v>

2084
01:33:11.051 --> 01:33:15.220
<v Speaker 3>really weird and like looking back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dude was clearly there.</v>

2085
01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:17.710
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what they might've been mid </v>
<v Speaker 3>boning,</v>

2086
01:33:17.711 --> 01:33:18.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

2087
01:33:18.821 --> 01:33:22.480
<v Speaker 3>you're acting weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we had a security question like</v>

2088
01:33:22.481 --> 01:33:23.170
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2089
01:33:23.170 --> 01:33:24.003
<v Speaker 3>like in Jason Bourne,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ask a question that they know the </v>

2090
01:33:26.321 --> 01:33:29.490
<v Speaker 3>answer to and if they answer it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2091
01:33:30.970 --> 01:33:35.470
<v Speaker 3>so I go up all the questions I go in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what city did we get married?</v>

2092
01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:38.740
<v Speaker 3>So now not only is she whipped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other guy,</v>

2093
01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:42.570

<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>

2094
01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:44.830
<v Speaker 3>she answered it correctly and I hung up </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

2095
01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:45.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we broke up,</v>

2096
01:33:45.971 --> 01:33:46.804

<v Speaker 3>I just don't know why I answered the </v>

2097
01:33:47.501 --> 01:33:48.760
<v Speaker 3>phone that day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

2098
01:33:48.761 --> 01:33:50.440
<v Speaker 3>I thought she was being burgled.</v>

2099
01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:51.791
<v Speaker 3>Oh right,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And that's how naive I was.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but you got an edge now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And all I'm hearing is like,</v>

01:35:18.051 --> 01:35:21.950
<v Speaker 3>volcano and I'm going to cut off his </v>
<v Speaker 3>head so he doesn't have to suffer,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while we're gone and she doesn't like </v>

2137
01:35:23.601 --> 01:35:24.434
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we butt heads in a way that we never </v>

2138
01:35:25.581 --> 01:35:27.200
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting to know.</v>

2139
01:35:27.230 --> 01:35:30.080
<v Speaker 3>Your mom was at her idea to raise you </v>
<v Speaker 3>super religious?</v>

<v Speaker 3>resentment there too.</v>

2142
01:35:33.801 --> 01:35:35.660
<v Speaker 3>And I got married because my mom was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you should get married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just true.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We went to Chili's in Burlington.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you've been there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

2157
01:36:08.901 --> 01:36:09.734
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to move to Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to break up with my wife </v>

2158
01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:14.490
<v Speaker 3>or my girlfriend at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't know if I,</v>

2159
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:16.280
<v Speaker 3>if we could live in sin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2160
01:36:16.281 --> 01:36:17.930
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't know if I can make that </v>
<v Speaker 3>move.</v>

2161
01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:19.250
<v Speaker 3>So she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just get married.</v>

2162
01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:20.900
<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

2163
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:22.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2164
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:26.690
<v Speaker 3>I get where she was coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do think there's some latent like,</v>

2165
01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:29.210
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it'd be like,</v>

2166
01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:32.090
<v Speaker 3>just live in sin for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See how that goes.</v>

2167
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:34.190
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for some people.</v>

2168
01:36:34.190 --> 01:36:35.300
<v Speaker 3>It's not an option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2169
01:36:35.301 --> 01:36:36.134
<v Speaker 3>Some people that are really religious in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last thing she would want to do is </v>

2170
01:36:37.821 --> 01:36:40.490
<v Speaker 3>tell her friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's what the church,</v>

2171
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:43.250
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the expectation of like,</v>

2172
01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:45.470
<v Speaker 3>you can't have a son who's living with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this girl.</v>

2173
01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:46.333
<v Speaker 3>Like I was the golden boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you were in your </v>

2174
01:36:48.531 --> 01:36:50.200
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was like her,</v>

2175
01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:53.870
<v Speaker 3>like it was so clear that she loved me </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most.</v>

2176
01:36:53.890 --> 01:36:56.780
<v Speaker 3>Like she's like obsessed with me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're still close,</v>

2177
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:59.150
<v Speaker 3>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she kinda guided me in that way.</v>

2178
01:36:59.930 --> 01:37:00.763
<v Speaker 3>But that's kind what crashing is about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like these things that you would </v>

2179
01:37:03.291 --> 01:37:06.950
<v Speaker 3>never ask for taking you to the place </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were afraid to go.</v>

2180
01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:08.780
<v Speaker 3>So she leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2181
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:11.480
<v Speaker 3>how'd you find out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She told me.</v>

2182
01:37:11.550 --> 01:37:13.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she took me to dinner hollow.</v>

2183
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:17.540
<v Speaker 3>She got me linguine with clams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was my favorite dishes.</v>

2184
01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Is it really good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lovey and I still eat.</v>

2185
01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:21.410
<v Speaker 3>Hardly ever do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I do,</v>

2186
01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:22.240
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you mean.</v>

2187
01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:23.073
<v Speaker 3>Treat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he been trying not to eat the </v>

2188
01:37:24.141 --> 01:37:25.080
<v Speaker 3>pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I do,</v>

2189
01:37:26.410 --> 01:37:28.130
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost worth it.</v>

2190
01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.370
<v Speaker 3>It's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we got that.</v>

2191
01:37:31.371 --> 01:37:33.650
<v Speaker 3>And then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a sad story.</v>

2192
01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:38.480
<v Speaker 3>She also took me to a liquor store to </v>
<v Speaker 3>buy alcohol for that night.</v>

2193
01:37:38.481 --> 01:37:40.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2194
01:37:40.251 --> 01:37:43.190
<v Speaker 3>the puppy that's getting driven to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>vet to be put down.</v>

2195
01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:45.360
<v Speaker 3>And then we went home and she had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

2196
01:37:45.361 --> 01:37:48.080
<v Speaker 3>she had a script and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2197
01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:50.120
<v Speaker 3>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want what's best for you.</v>

2198
01:37:50.121 --> 01:37:50.631
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh hey,</v>

2199
01:37:50.631 --> 01:37:51.770
<v Speaker 3>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she was like,</v>

2200
01:37:51.850 --> 01:37:52.683
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you deserve to be with someone who </v>

2201
01:37:53.571 --> 01:37:54.770
<v Speaker 3>really loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2202
01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2203
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:59.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad to just not getting Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ.</v>

2204
01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:01.830
<v Speaker 3>Number three was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be a cheating wife.</v>

2205
01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:03.180
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so don't be.</v>

2206
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:04.703
<v Speaker 3>That was my response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she was dead silent and then I </v>

2207
01:38:07.621 --> 01:38:09.600
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there someone else?</v>

2208
01:38:09.601 --> 01:38:10.434
<v Speaker 3>I said it as a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I felt like I was in a TV show and </v>

2209
01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:16.020
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there someone else like,</v>

2210
01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:19.470
<v Speaker 3>as if that could be a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her silence was deafening.</v>

2211
01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:20.970
<v Speaker 3>And then I swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

2212
01:38:20.971 --> 01:38:23.070
<v Speaker 3>my next question was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it a comedian?</v>

2213
01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:25.770
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2214
01:38:26.250 --> 01:38:28.260
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is later in the conversation.</v>

2215
01:38:28.261 --> 01:38:30.150
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're leaving me for us civilian.</v>

2216
01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:31.253
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

2217
01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:34.820
<v Speaker 7>See,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love comedians.</v>

2218
01:38:34.821 --> 01:38:39.680
<v Speaker 7>How could you date a comedian and hang </v>
<v Speaker 7>out with my comedian friends and we'd go</v>

2219
01:38:39.681 --> 01:38:40.520
<v Speaker 7>to shows.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's,</v>

2220
01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:42.890
<v Speaker 7>I love show business.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love comedy.</v>

2221
01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:46.500
<v Speaker 7>How could you leave the best thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the best people?</v>

2222
01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>

2223
01:38:48.111 --> 01:38:49.820
<v Speaker 2>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

2224
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't agree with me.</v>

2225
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.470
<v Speaker 2>You think that's stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2226
01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:56.040
<v Speaker 2>that comedians are fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2227
01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:59.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they're fun for some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that the only,</v>

2228
01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously I'm sure I probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>would've thought at the time too,</v>

2229
01:39:03.051 --> 01:39:06.380
<v Speaker 2>if you talked to me when I was 22 it 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or when I was 28.</v>

2230
01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:09.800
<v Speaker 2>I think when you're really deep in love </v>
<v Speaker 2>with something,</v>

2231
01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:12.320
<v Speaker 2>it becomes the only world that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine.</v>

2232
01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:16.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that now with my current fiance,</v>

2233

2234

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a comedy joke for bits.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you will kill me,</v>

2237

<v Speaker 3>and this isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad this isn't one of them,</v>

2271
01:40:46.951 --> 01:40:50.370
<v Speaker 3>but I've also calmed down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if you have at a certain point,</v>

2272
01:40:50.371 --> 01:40:51.204
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to report to our species </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians that I think there is a level </v>

2273
01:40:56.081 --> 01:40:58.600
<v Speaker 3>that you reach where you relax a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

2274
01:40:58.840 --> 01:40:59.673
<v Speaker 3>You've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've gone in the fancy green room and </v>

2275
01:41:01.691 --> 01:41:03.940
<v Speaker 3>you've eaten the apple pie and you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>go like,</v>

2276
01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:05.490
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've.</v>

2277
01:41:05.491 --> 01:41:06.940
<v Speaker 3>I've seen the strings at the puppet </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

2278
01:41:06.941 --> 01:41:07.774
<v Speaker 3>We can keep playing the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not as desperate or afraid as I </v>

2279
01:41:11.471 --> 01:41:12.670
<v Speaker 3>used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2280
01:41:12.671 --> 01:41:14.380
<v Speaker 3>it's a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's ups,</v>

2281
01:41:14.381 --> 01:41:18.490
<v Speaker 3>there's downs and there's a lot of other</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit to life than comedy.</v>

2282
01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:21.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't do sets every night anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of like A.</v>

2283
01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:25.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a three times a week ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think three times a week is fine.</v>

2284
01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:27.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't do it every night either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2285
01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:28.473
<v Speaker 3>but I think the discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you are confident in your </v>

2286
01:41:31.601 --> 01:41:32.434
<v Speaker 3>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can mitigate some of the negative </v>

2287
01:41:35.171 --> 01:41:37.750
<v Speaker 3>aspects of obsession because like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2288
01:41:37.751 --> 01:41:39.280
<v Speaker 3>you're doing the work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're putting in the work.</v>

2289
01:41:39.281 --> 01:41:40.930
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't feel bad taking a night </v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

2290
01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:42.030
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got,</v>

2291
01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:42.953
<v Speaker 3>you know what somebody said that really </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed the game for me was live a life </v>

2292
01:41:45.791 --> 01:41:47.440
<v Speaker 3>worth commenting on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

2293
01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:49.960
<v Speaker 3>You can't just go out and next thing you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2294
01:41:49.961 --> 01:41:52.360
<v Speaker 3>you're just doing bits about motels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hotels,</v>

2295
01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:56.050
<v Speaker 3>holiday inns and fucking airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>

2296
01:41:56.290 --> 01:41:57.123
<v Speaker 3>But if I just go to a concert or just go</v>
<v Speaker 3>camping or just go on a trip and have </v>

2297
01:42:03.461 --> 01:42:05.020
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not even thinking like,</v>

2298
01:42:05.021 --> 01:42:05.854
<v Speaker 3>could I get a bed out of this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can go to a sensory deprivation tank </v>

2299
01:42:08.381 --> 01:42:10.510
<v Speaker 3>and not go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the bit here?</v>

2300
01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:13.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>salt on my asshole.</v>

2301
01:42:13.450 --> 01:42:14.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm not thinking that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>

2302
01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:17.740
<v Speaker 3>this is life and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

2303
01:42:17.741 --> 01:42:19.360
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the way we should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't.</v>

2304
01:42:19.810 --> 01:42:24.810
<v Speaker 3>There is this three way thing going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not as starved anymore.</v>

2305
01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:27.370
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember some balance?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely a balance,</v>

2306
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:28.263
<v Speaker 3>but when you started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of one of the other things </v>

2307
01:42:29.981 --> 01:42:33.190
<v Speaker 3>that show is about is that fervor that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have when you're starting,</v>

2308
01:42:33.730 --> 01:42:35.410
<v Speaker 3>where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually got cut,</v>

2309
01:42:35.411 --> 01:42:36.244
<v Speaker 3>but there was a scene we wrote where it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like if you're holding your </v>

2310
01:42:37.931 --> 01:42:38.764
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend in one hand and comedy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other which will and lauren lap </v>

2311
01:42:41.621 --> 01:42:44.560
<v Speaker 3>guests who plays my wife did this really</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny ref because she's like,</v>

2312
01:42:44.561 --> 01:42:47.860
<v Speaker 3>if you're holding me and you're holding </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy over a cliff,</v>

2313
01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:48.903
<v Speaker 3>which one you pull up like the good son </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had to think about it and while </v>

2314
01:42:51.761 --> 01:42:52.594
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she just knows she's bawling and she's </v>

2315
01:42:56.051 --> 01:42:56.790
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2316
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:57.623
<v Speaker 3>That there's something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope that people when they watch the </v>

2317
01:42:59.651 --> 01:43:01.630
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that.</v>

2318
01:43:01.631 --> 01:43:06.130
<v Speaker 3>I understand why my wife left me in real</v>
<v Speaker 3>life and also why the character,</v>

2319
01:43:06.370 --> 01:43:09.080
<v Speaker 3>the kind of pretend wife on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also left.</v>

2320
01:43:09.110 --> 01:43:11.230
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the same with rock and </v>
<v Speaker 3>roll.</v>

2321
01:43:11.231 --> 01:43:12.064
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probably the same with art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probably the same with </v>

2322
01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:17.920
<v Speaker 3>everything that you become obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes when people were involved in a</v>

2323
01:43:17.921 --> 01:43:19.510
<v Speaker 3>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when they're young.</v>

2324
01:43:20.170 --> 01:43:21.003
<v Speaker 3>It seems like your whole world to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person who doesn't have this other </v>

2325
01:43:25.031 --> 01:43:26.170
<v Speaker 3>obsession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like comedy,</v>

2326
01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:27.333
<v Speaker 3>like say if you have just a regular job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're working at an insurance company </v>

2327
01:43:29.681 --> 01:43:31.270
<v Speaker 3>or something like that and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>boyfriend's a comedian,</v>

2328
01:43:31.271 --> 01:43:32.104
<v Speaker 3>your girlfriend's a comedian and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just want to get home and have dinner </v>

2329
01:43:35.021 --> 01:43:35.854
<v Speaker 3>and sit down with them and they have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>rush off to the city to do some fucking </v>

2330
01:43:38.171 --> 01:43:40.180
<v Speaker 3>sat and he won't be home until 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning.</v>

2331
01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Not Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>

2332
01:43:41.710 --> 01:43:43.360
<v Speaker 3>It's not what you want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2333
01:43:43.361 --> 01:43:44.194
<v Speaker 3>It has it in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife said I don't want to be Pete </v>

2334
01:43:46.630 --> 01:43:49.750
<v Speaker 3>Holmes is why I kinda get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

2335
01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:51.770
<v Speaker 3>Like even at the time I was like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sex,</v>

2336
01:43:51.771 --> 01:43:53.450
<v Speaker 3>but I kinda get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Makes Sense.</v>

2337
01:43:53.970 --> 01:43:54.803
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then someone might want to be </v>

2338
01:43:56.781 --> 01:43:57.710
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

2339
01:43:57.711 --> 01:43:58.340
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2340
01:43:58.340 --> 01:43:59.173
<v Speaker 3>no matter what there is about your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about finding someone who can </v>

2341
01:44:03.021 --> 01:44:05.300
<v Speaker 3>appreciate whatever that is about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and help you.</v>

2342
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:06.383
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's typically something people </v>

2343
01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:08.174
<v Speaker 3>say about kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like seeing the world through their </v>

2344
01:44:09.711 --> 01:44:12.260
<v Speaker 3>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we go talk about the four seasons.</v>

2345
01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:13.133
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do a corporate gig and they put you </v>

2346
01:44:13.731 --> 01:44:14.564
<v Speaker 3>up at the four seasons and you and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have done that before you bring the new </v>

2347
01:44:18.561 --> 01:44:19.910
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the excited person.</v>

2348
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:22.490
<v Speaker 3>It's so fun to surprise Valerie with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2349
01:44:22.491 --> 01:44:23.324
<v Speaker 3>It's so fun to go to the show together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just did a corporate and it was </v>

2350
01:44:25.851 --> 01:44:27.350
<v Speaker 3>brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got the back sweat,</v>

2351
01:44:27.351 --> 01:44:28.250
<v Speaker 3>dry mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

2352
01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:29.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're never great.</v>

2353
01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:30.163
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those things.</v>

2354
01:44:30.230 --> 01:44:34.610
<v Speaker 3>And she was there and we laugh about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we should share the adventure.</v>

2355
01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:35.713
<v Speaker 3>She has her own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She works for a charity called real </v>

2356
01:44:36.861 --> 01:44:38.870
<v Speaker 3>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a female empowerment program.</v>

2357
01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:41.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know feminism is a cancer.</v>

2358
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:43.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's what she does.</v>

2359
01:44:43.581 --> 01:44:44.414
<v Speaker 3>But it's flexible enough that we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can go to New York and filmed the </v>

2360
01:44:47.121 --> 01:44:50.850
<v Speaker 3>show and come to La and do shows in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hawaii or whatever it might be.</v>

2361
01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:51.740
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2362
01:44:51.741 --> 01:44:52.610
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you found some.</v>

2363
01:44:52.611 --> 01:44:56.240
<v Speaker 3>I think I've always made this analogy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people are kind of like the fingers</v>

2364
01:44:56.241 --> 01:45:00.200
<v Speaker 3>of two hands and if they fall together </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that where it's a perfect fit.</v>

2365
01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:01.333
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in,</v>

2366
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:03.320
<v Speaker 3>you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of times people get this thing</v>

2367
01:45:03.321 --> 01:45:06.400
<v Speaker 3>going on where you get those bottom two </v>
<v Speaker 3>fingers with the top two fingers.</v>

2368
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:08.610
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand is a lot of wildland </v>
<v Speaker 3>fire.</v>

2369
01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:10.070
<v Speaker 3>Missed high five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

2370
01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:11.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2371
01:45:11.241 --> 01:45:11.691
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>

2372
01:45:11.691 --> 01:45:14.420
<v Speaker 3>the last person that did that for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2373
01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:18.080
<v Speaker 3>the crashing is about these stories of </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're starting and when it sucks.</v>

2374
01:45:18.081 --> 01:45:20.240
<v Speaker 3>I really think that's kind of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting thing.</v>

2375
01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:21.373
<v Speaker 3>A lot of shows that I love about </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians are about comedians when </v>

2376
01:45:23.961 --> 01:45:25.970
<v Speaker 3>they're successful and that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

2377
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:29.780
<v Speaker 3>This is a show about these times and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was opening for Bill Burr,</v>

2378
01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:32.900
<v Speaker 3>and this is 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Peoria.</v>

2379
01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:33.773
<v Speaker 3>I actually made a youtube video of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>called Pete Holmes bombing where I kind </v>

2380
01:45:36.051 --> 01:45:39.400
<v Speaker 3>of do commentary on it when I got off </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage,</v>

2381
01:45:39.410 --> 01:45:41.930
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want it to be like this,</v>

2382
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.823
<v Speaker 3>but you were like this like the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>time just describing it to people you </v>

2383
01:45:46.221 --> 01:45:48.380
<v Speaker 3>want it to be like the hands intersect </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly,</v>

2384
01:45:48.381 --> 01:45:51.710
<v Speaker 3>but the fingertips are smashing into </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other and he was absolutely right.</v>

2385
01:45:51.930 --> 01:45:52.763
<v Speaker 3>You know when you're bombing and it just</v>
<v Speaker 3>feels like the words are just getting </v>

2386
01:45:54.891 --> 01:45:57.860
<v Speaker 3>sucked into a vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no connection.</v>

2387
01:45:57.890 --> 01:45:58.723
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have no connection with it so the </v>

2388
01:45:59.451 --> 01:46:00.284
<v Speaker 3>audience is never going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>connection with it and it's impossible </v>

2389
01:46:01.821 --> 01:46:02.654
<v Speaker 3>for you to have a connection with </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know you're bombing and </v>

2390
01:46:03.861 --> 01:46:04.694
<v Speaker 3>you're pretending to have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's the rub is my comedy </v>

2391
01:46:08.090 --> 01:46:10.250
<v Speaker 3>typically comes from a positive place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2392
01:46:10.251 --> 01:46:11.084
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to lean into my sweetness and my </v>

2393
01:46:12.861 --> 01:46:15.590
<v Speaker 3>enthusiasm and wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I,</v>

2394
01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:16.453
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this happened I was at in Irvine and I </v>

2395
01:46:17.871 --> 01:46:21.460
<v Speaker 3>was onstage and I had this bid about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lululemon.</v>

2396
01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:23.630
<v Speaker 3>This hoodie that I'm actually wearing is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Lulu lemon.</v>

2397
01:46:23.631 --> 01:46:25.880
<v Speaker 3>I just like Lulu Lemon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who fucking cares.</v>

2398
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:28.500
<v Speaker 3>So I have a bit about it though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like any comedian.</v>

2399
01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:30.950
<v Speaker 3>So it's my opener.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I go,</v>

2400
01:46:31.190 --> 01:46:33.590
<v Speaker 3>this is a Lulu Lemon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want you wondering.</v>

2401
01:46:33.591 --> 01:46:38.150
<v Speaker 3>The whole show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the setup of the next joke is I</v>

2402
01:46:38.151 --> 01:46:41.030
<v Speaker 3>think I think people like ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a guy in a Lulu,</v>

2403
01:46:41.150 --> 01:46:43.520
<v Speaker 3>it says something about them and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>this girl,</v>

2404
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:45.740
<v Speaker 3>this isn't the first 30 seconds of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>first,</v>

2405
01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:48.770
<v Speaker 3>first row girl big table because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>gay,</v>

2406
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:50.303
<v Speaker 3>you're gay.</v>

2407
01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:52.320
<v Speaker 1>And I just kind of wiped it out and was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2408
01:46:52.321 --> 01:46:55.080
<v Speaker 1>it's 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you're fucking ignorant.</v>

2409
01:46:55.090 --> 01:46:55.923
<v Speaker 1>Like just kinda like what it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were laughing but I was just </v>

2410
01:46:58.441 --> 01:47:02.700
<v Speaker 1>leaned into her and then I had to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>merge back into my silly,</v>

2411
01:47:02.701 --> 01:47:04.980
<v Speaker 1>silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun boy comedy routine.</v>

2412
01:47:05.250 --> 01:47:08.010
<v Speaker 1>I literally have a light in my act back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then where I go,</v>

2413
01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:10.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to be angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

2414
01:47:10.591 --> 01:47:15.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's usually like a big laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd already seen me be very angry.</v>

2415
01:47:15.121 --> 01:47:18.910
<v Speaker 1>You got mad when she said you're gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of a Lululemon lawn.</v>

2416
01:47:19.370 --> 01:47:20.203
<v Speaker 1>When you just assume that that's seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's what someone would say it </v>

2417
01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:26.610
<v Speaker 1>maybe if I last for 35 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you left the gap,</v>

2418
01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:29.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you siding with this crazy woman?</v>

2419
01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:31.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a heckle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

2420
01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:32.393
<v Speaker 1>Never side with a heckler in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>30 seconds and I'm doing the setup and </v>

2421
01:47:36.091 --> 01:47:36.924
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gay or was there someone on </v>

2422
01:47:38.010 --> 01:47:38.843
<v Speaker 1>before you?</v>

2423
01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:39.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two opening.</v>

2424
01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:42.960
<v Speaker 1>So they were drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this lady probably lit up.</v>

2425
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:44.910
<v Speaker 1>You get on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's been hearing people say,</v>

2426
01:47:44.911 --> 01:47:45.744
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's marginally funny because they're </v>

2427
01:47:46.501 --> 01:47:48.090
<v Speaker 1>not as funny as you because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>openers.</v>

2428
01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:50.160
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can find.</v>

2429
01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

2430
01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:55.390
<v Speaker 1>you're gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hate is.</v>

2431
01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:58.570
<v Speaker 1>I think it says something about me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2432
01:47:58.830 --> 01:48:00.330
<v Speaker 1>That's so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2433
01:48:00.331 --> 01:48:02.580
<v Speaker 1>you're gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody would say that.</v>

2434
01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:06.810
<v Speaker 1>And 90 nine point nine percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time people have the decency to go.</v>

2435
01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:09.450
<v Speaker 1>It's probably going somewhere guard </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the guard.</v>

2436
01:48:09.451 --> 01:48:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Against that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10th of one percent.</v>

2437
01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come up with a better name.</v>

2438
01:48:12.890 --> 01:48:16.860
<v Speaker 1>You know what I can counter argue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that for sure.</v>

2439
01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Remain vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

2440
01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Get heckled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2441
01:48:20.010 --> 01:48:20.843
<v Speaker 1>Get some scars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay because I don't like </v>

2442
01:48:22.111 --> 01:48:23.520
<v Speaker 1>bulletproof comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2443
01:48:23.521 --> 01:48:25.260
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're never bulletproof.</v>

2444
01:48:25.290 --> 01:48:26.123
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and second of all prepare for someone </v>

2445
01:48:28.261 --> 01:48:29.880
<v Speaker 1>saying you're gay because it's coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2446
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:32.140
<v Speaker 1>That Joe 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

2447
01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:34.860
<v Speaker 1>So do you have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you have a backup line?</v>

2448
01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Like when she said you're gay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had been in a better mood,</v>

2449
01:48:38.850 --> 01:48:42.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe I would have had mode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know homophobia,</v>

2450
01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:43.553
<v Speaker 1>like I hate the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's that homophobic to say that it </v>

2451
01:48:46.561 --> 01:48:48.480
<v Speaker 1>says you're gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with being gay,</v>

2452
01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:49.433
<v Speaker 1>so there's nothing wrong with being gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>and gay people are very fashionable and </v>

2453
01:48:52.411 --> 01:48:56.480
<v Speaker 1>someone says something about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's unpack that a little bit.</v>

2454
01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:57.613
<v Speaker 1>I do take offense at the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people into gentler or more flowy yoga </v>

2455
01:49:03.631 --> 01:49:04.464
<v Speaker 1>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are therefore weaker and being </v>

2456
01:49:07.531 --> 01:49:08.364
<v Speaker 1>weak is like being gay and being gay is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like being Frou Frou or like a ferry or </v>

2457
01:49:12.301 --> 01:49:13.134
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make an offensive to a group of </v>

2458
01:49:14.671 --> 01:49:15.570
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense,</v>

2459
01:49:15.571 --> 01:49:18.810
<v Speaker 1>but you're making a giant leap by saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone is into Lulu Lemon,</v>

2460
01:49:18.811 --> 01:49:19.644
<v Speaker 1>which is really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clothes that make really good fitness </v>

2461
01:49:21.301 --> 01:49:22.170
<v Speaker 1>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

2462
01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:24.390
<v Speaker 1>and that that somehow or another is </v>
<v Speaker 1>weak.</v>

2463
01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:25.313
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's weak at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's called Lulu Lemon Joe Lulu </v>

2464
01:49:29.251 --> 01:49:30.084
<v Speaker 1>lemon shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is that women assume that </v>

2465
01:49:34.321 --> 01:49:35.154
<v Speaker 1>men who are really fashionable or into </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion and understand and appreciate </v>

2466
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:41.990
<v Speaker 1>fashion yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then times 10,</v>

2467
01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:42.893
<v Speaker 1>can we talk about black people love </v>
<v Speaker 1>fried chicken and watermelon fried </v>

2468
01:49:45.961 --> 01:49:48.280
<v Speaker 1>chicken is delicious because everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>loves fried</v>

2469
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:51.600
<v Speaker 3>chicken and large groups of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't gay like looking fashionable.</v>

2470
01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:54.400
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's going to be allowed to make?</v>

2471
01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:57.700
<v Speaker 3>Then I discouraged that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

2472
01:49:57.790 --> 01:50:01.030
<v Speaker 3>I agree with him also saying I defend my</v>
<v Speaker 3>right to discourage.</v>

2473
01:50:01.031 --> 01:50:01.864
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that if you are a standup </v>

2474
01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:08.020
<v Speaker 3>comedian working in a unit that sells </v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol,</v>

2475
01:50:08.050 --> 01:50:11.080
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the student being taught by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the message.</v>

2476
01:50:11.110 --> 01:50:12.220
<v Speaker 3>That is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2477
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:13.143
<v Speaker 3>I should've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to say you left it open like I </v>

2478
01:50:16.171 --> 01:50:18.700
<v Speaker 3>would if I was your friend spur of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>

2479
01:50:18.730 --> 01:50:23.460
<v Speaker 3>Too Long in the $30 to come see me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2480
01:50:23.461 --> 01:50:25.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fuck this guy shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2481
01:50:25.451 --> 01:50:28.900
<v Speaker 3>it's just natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a natural,</v>

2482
01:50:28.901 --> 01:50:29.734
<v Speaker 3>wise ass thing to say by someone who has</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one person at the office to do </v>

2483
01:50:33.341 --> 01:50:35.680
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want us to to do.</v>

2484
01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I expect my audiences to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want the clubs to be better.</v>

2485
01:50:41.801 --> 01:50:45.820
<v Speaker 3>I want us to elevate our game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people always like to say do better.</v>

2486
01:50:45.821 --> 01:50:46.654
<v Speaker 3>You know what's another thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people like to say that's really </v>

2487
01:50:47.891 --> 01:50:50.640
<v Speaker 3>disturbing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The worst is the worst.</v>

2488
01:50:51.670 --> 01:50:54.910
<v Speaker 3>The worst is being eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Asshole first by hyenas.</v>

2489
01:50:54.911 --> 01:50:56.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the worst.</v>

2490
01:50:56.660 --> 01:50:59.130
<v Speaker 3>Anything other than that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We really stopped calling it the worst.</v>

2491
01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.280
<v Speaker 3>People love to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2492
01:51:01.390 --> 01:51:03.600
<v Speaker 3>Pete Holmes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The worst that guys.</v>

2493
01:51:03.610 --> 01:51:06.010
<v Speaker 3>The worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a joke about homophobia.</v>

2494
01:51:06.011 --> 01:51:10.270
<v Speaker 3>He's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such an overused term.</v>

2495
01:51:10.271 --> 01:51:11.104
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He cut her term that people are using </v>

2496
01:51:14.111 --> 01:51:16.210
<v Speaker 3>today where they just throw it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2497
01:51:16.211 --> 01:51:17.770
<v Speaker 3>you're the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to join.</v>

2498
01:51:17.771 --> 01:51:18.604
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people have arrested </v>

2499
01:51:20.561 --> 01:51:21.520
<v Speaker 3>development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally.</v>

2500
01:51:21.521 --> 01:51:22.354
<v Speaker 3>They stopped for sure developing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in fifth grade you realize that you </v>

2501
01:51:25.301 --> 01:51:27.520
<v Speaker 3>could win friends by keeping your shoe's</v>
<v Speaker 3>untied.</v>

2502
01:51:27.610 --> 01:51:29.440
<v Speaker 3>You're a bad boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also being like,</v>

2503
01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:32.680
<v Speaker 3>you didn't have the cool kid with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>untied shoes.</v>

2504
01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:34.480
<v Speaker 3>No Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

2505
01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:37.450
<v Speaker 3>Alright then let's just untie your </v>
<v Speaker 3>confusing as shit.</v>

2506
01:51:37.451 --> 01:51:38.284
<v Speaker 3>I mean Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you with them on this January kid who </v>

2507
01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:40.753
<v Speaker 3>doesn't give a shit as easy as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even just when it comes to shoes tied </v>

2508
01:51:43.631 --> 01:51:44.470
<v Speaker 3>shoe thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2509
01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:46.870
<v Speaker 3>The kid who doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm older than you.</v>

2510
01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:48.010
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I missed that.</v>

2511
01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:48.873
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kid who didn't tie his horse to the </v>

2512
01:51:49.931 --> 01:51:52.150
<v Speaker 3>stable and that was the guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2513
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:55.600
<v Speaker 3>he's a rebel bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His horse just wanders around.</v>

2514
01:51:55.601 --> 01:52:00.040
<v Speaker 3>The navy calls it with a whistle like </v>
<v Speaker 3>red dead.</v>

2515
01:52:00.041 --> 01:52:00.874
<v Speaker 3>I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but forget the shoe tying into a </v>

2516
01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:04.713
<v Speaker 3>stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these guys that learned how to win </v>

2517
01:52:06.341 --> 01:52:07.250
<v Speaker 3>friends by going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2518
01:52:07.251 --> 01:52:09.210
<v Speaker 3>ms dot Johnson sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2519
01:52:09.211 --> 01:52:09.490
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2520
01:52:09.490 --> 01:52:13.900
<v Speaker 3>And then they just learn like sarcasm </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be so funny.</v>

2521
01:52:14.050 --> 01:52:14.883
<v Speaker 3>But I think so many people that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>misappropriating sarcasm by saying </v>

2522
01:52:17.711 --> 01:52:18.640
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex,</v>

2523
01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:20.590
<v Speaker 3>if I'm eating a Burrito in the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 3>falls out.</v>

2524
01:52:20.591 --> 01:52:25.030
<v Speaker 3>They go though it looks like a good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's not funny.</v>

2525
01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:28.170
<v Speaker 3>You're just being a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in their twitter bio UC,</v>

2526
01:52:28.171 --> 01:52:31.990
<v Speaker 3>like sarcasm is just one of the many </v>
<v Speaker 3>services I offer.</v>

2527
01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:34.360
<v Speaker 3>You're just an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not funny.</v>

2528
01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:36.900
<v Speaker 3>Chandler are better with sarcasm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2529
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:41.140
<v Speaker 3>But they probably are trying and failing</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like we try and fail with jokes.</v>

2530
01:52:41.370 --> 01:52:44.830
<v Speaker 3>Like Lulu Lemon joke isn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

2531
01:52:44.831 --> 01:52:47.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean all try and fail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gearhart bad you,</v>

2532
01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:48.283
<v Speaker 3>you hate as a lack of imagination and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are stepping into other people's </v>

2533
01:52:51.501 --> 01:52:53.360
<v Speaker 3>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was probably lit.</v>

2534
01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:56.110
<v Speaker 3>She's probably trying to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't know it.</v>

2535
01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:56.993
<v Speaker 3>Tape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to be concerted effort of </v>

2536
01:52:58.521 --> 01:52:59.354
<v Speaker 3>someone trying to fuck things up for me </v>
<v Speaker 3>to actually experienced hate towards </v>

2537
01:53:03.231 --> 01:53:03.710
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2538
01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:06.650
<v Speaker 3>It was because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2539
01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:08.060
<v Speaker 3>you could get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2540
01:53:08.061 --> 01:53:10.630
<v Speaker 3>I could go on stage in a bad mood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can happen.</v>

2541
01:53:10.670 --> 01:53:13.850
<v Speaker 3>Older women with wine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like I don't feel like you're</v>

2542
01:53:13.851 --> 01:53:16.070
<v Speaker 3>a friendly crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can happen.</v>

2543
01:53:16.850 --> 01:53:18.590
<v Speaker 3>It can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my opener,</v>

2544
01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:21.800
<v Speaker 3>who is gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian Sullivan Kinda didn't do very well</v>

2545
01:53:21.801 --> 01:53:25.370
<v Speaker 3>and it was just kinda like you guys are </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving me the wrong vibe.</v>

2546
01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:27.530
<v Speaker 3>And I thought maybe it was a teachable </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment,</v>

2547
01:53:27.570 --> 01:53:31.790
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes it's like you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>establish the moment properly,</v>

2548
01:53:31.810 --> 01:53:32.643
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes like I'll look back at some </v>

2549
01:53:34.131 --> 01:53:35.930
<v Speaker 3>lines that I used to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

2550
01:53:36.130 --> 01:53:37.790
<v Speaker 3>they just didn't do that well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2551
01:53:37.791 --> 01:53:40.380
<v Speaker 3>did I just get attached to this line?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did I stop it?</v>

2552
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:42.800
<v Speaker 3>Did I have a development in my standup?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2553
01:53:42.810 --> 01:53:45.380
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I sort of got attached to saying</v>

2554
01:53:45.381 --> 01:53:46.214
<v Speaker 3>something this way because I had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it like that for six months or </v>

2555
01:53:48.051 --> 01:53:48.740
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2556
01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:49.820
<v Speaker 3>And then you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2557
01:53:49.821 --> 01:53:51.710
<v Speaker 3>that's not a good way to set it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to just,</v>

2558
01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:53.630
<v Speaker 3>I'll actually tell my babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2559
01:53:53.631 --> 01:53:56.420
<v Speaker 3>that expression I've heard kill your </v>
<v Speaker 3>darlings that kill you.</v>

2560
01:53:56.750 --> 01:54:00.440
<v Speaker 3>Kill your babies in terms of creatively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>creatively,</v>

2561
01:54:00.441 --> 01:54:01.274
<v Speaker 3>you have to kill some of the ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're attached to them because </v>

2562
01:54:03.681 --> 01:54:04.970
<v Speaker 3>they're yours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You painful.</v>

2563
01:54:05.010 --> 01:54:06.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of what writing is for.</v>

2564
01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:07.760
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go.</v>

2565
01:54:07.761 --> 01:54:11.200
<v Speaker 3>One word is shit on my own experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2566
01:54:11.450 --> 01:54:15.230
<v Speaker 3>when you craft an act for fans and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know you know this feeling,</v>

2567
01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:17.600
<v Speaker 3>then you go to a club where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Irvine,</v>

2568
01:54:17.601 --> 01:54:19.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the crowd was necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>there to see me.</v>

2569
01:54:20.130 --> 01:54:21.110
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2570
01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:22.670
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2571
01:54:22.671 --> 01:54:25.160
<v Speaker 3>Stand up is more like boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I remember.</v>

2572
01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you like,</v>

2573
01:54:26.331 --> 01:54:28.700
<v Speaker 3>if you watch my special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all fans.</v>

2574
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:30.390
<v Speaker 3>You get a standing ovation when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out.</v>

2575
01:54:30.710 --> 01:54:31.543
<v Speaker 3>And I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to quote Sinbad said that he </v>

2576
01:54:34.561 --> 01:54:35.190
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>

2577
01:54:35.190 --> 01:54:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I love this quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2578
01:54:36.020 --> 01:54:37.610
<v Speaker 3>certainly is a very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was great.</v>

2579
01:54:37.611 --> 01:54:39.650
<v Speaker 3>He did my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tony Hinchcliffe says he's awesome.</v>

2580
01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Talk about leaving your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Astral projection.</v>

2581
01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:43.760
<v Speaker 3>Same bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it?</v>

2582
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:46.590
<v Speaker 3>He asked truly projects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>astral project,</v>

2583
01:54:46.610 --> 01:54:48.050
<v Speaker 3>how's he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stopped doing well.</v>

2584
01:54:48.051 --> 01:54:50.450
<v Speaker 3>There's all these techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's books and stuff about it.</v>

2585
01:54:50.630 --> 01:54:55.400
<v Speaker 3>The long and the short is you get into a</v>
<v Speaker 3>trance and you imagine a rope above you.</v>

2586
01:54:55.410 --> 01:54:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Then pull yourself down or what he did </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually remember,</v>

2587
01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:01.520
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put something just out of my reach.</v>

2588
01:55:01.850 --> 01:55:02.683
<v Speaker 3>And then you're trying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you're laying there with your eyes </v>

2589
01:55:04.941 --> 01:55:05.840
<v Speaker 3>closed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditating,</v>

2590
01:55:05.841 --> 01:55:06.674
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to reach the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he said he felt his hand </v>

2591
01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:10.093
<v Speaker 3>wrapped around it and that's how he knew</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had left his body and he did it for </v>

2592
01:55:12.681 --> 01:55:13.670
<v Speaker 3>months and months and months and months.</v>

2593
01:55:13.670 --> 01:55:16.580
<v Speaker 3>And then one day he said he was like in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this weird place he was in the cave.</v>

2594
01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:20.180
<v Speaker 3>Something like shadow creature came up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and hit him in the chest.</v>

2595
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:22.940
<v Speaker 3>I know this is sinbad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember Eddie goes.</v>

2596
01:55:22.970 --> 01:55:26.360
<v Speaker 3>And it felt like someone had cracked me </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the chest with a sledge hammer and he</v>

2597
01:55:26.361 --> 01:55:27.320
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never did it again.</v>

2598
01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:28.550
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2599
01:55:28.551 --> 01:55:29.690
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to go back?</v>

2600
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Try and find like booby island or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2601
01:55:31.950 --> 01:55:32.783
<v Speaker 3>He's right though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's ready to be snatched up by </v>

2602
01:55:34.371 --> 01:55:37.850
<v Speaker 3>the demons and stranger things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is next dimension demon that lives in</v>

2603
01:55:37.851 --> 01:55:39.110
<v Speaker 3>the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is scary.</v>

2604
01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:42.050
<v Speaker 3>If you read a journey's out of the body </v>
<v Speaker 3>are far.</v>

2605
01:55:42.051 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 3>Journey is a Robert Monroe in</v>

2606
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.903
<v Speaker 4>the fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you read this book and he </v>

2607
01:55:46.381 --> 01:55:47.214
<v Speaker 4>still calls black people negros and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff like you can tell it's an old old </v>

2608
01:55:49.651 --> 01:55:50.484
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's telling that's how old this </v>

2609
01:55:51.691 --> 01:55:52.950
<v Speaker 4>stuff is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's goes way back.</v>

2610
01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:54.053
<v Speaker 4>He would tell stories about like seeing </v>
<v Speaker 4>something fly by and being very </v>

2611
01:55:56.701 --> 01:55:59.880
<v Speaker 4>concerned that that thing was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get into his body before you needed.</v>

2612
01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:02.790
<v Speaker 4>So it's kind of a scary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

2613
01:56:03.150 --> 01:56:05.790
<v Speaker 4>but don't you think that dreams and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2614
01:56:05.791 --> 01:56:09.840
<v Speaker 4>moods like states of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the state of mind that you had when</v>

2615
01:56:09.841 --> 01:56:13.050
<v Speaker 4>you went on stage that time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the state of mind that you have when you</v>

2616
01:56:13.051 --> 01:56:16.650
<v Speaker 4>have a fucked up dream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like the ability to do that,</v>

2617
01:56:16.651 --> 01:56:17.484
<v Speaker 4>your mind has to change stances and </v>
<v Speaker 4>positions and that these stances and </v>

2618
01:56:21.301 --> 01:56:24.840
<v Speaker 4>positions really greatly affect how you </v>
<v Speaker 4>react to a situation.</v>

2619
01:56:25.110 --> 01:56:29.440
<v Speaker 4>So you're coming into something with so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much baggage and so much good or bad.</v>

2620
01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:32.430
<v Speaker 4>Like sometimes you come into something </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you'd be in the best mood ever.</v>

2621
01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:36.780
<v Speaker 4>And like I got rear ended by this </v>
<v Speaker 4>undocumented worker and uh,</v>

2622
01:56:36.810 --> 01:56:39.330
<v Speaker 4>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy was illegal in the country.</v>

2623
01:56:39.331 --> 01:56:42.330
<v Speaker 4>He was from Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't have insurance and I had,</v>

2624
01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:46.620
<v Speaker 4>it was my favorite car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a porsche nine slash 11,</v>

2625
01:56:46.621 --> 01:56:50.610
<v Speaker 4>gt three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a race car to car to drive.</v>

2626
01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:52.470
<v Speaker 4>I've had it for years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

2627
01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:53.573
<v Speaker 4>It's just like really light car that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sound in this guy fucking plowed into </v>

2628
01:56:57.301 --> 01:56:58.740
<v Speaker 4>them and the engine's in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2629
01:56:58.741 --> 01:57:00.420
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

2630
01:57:00.421 --> 01:57:01.254
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking my car's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But luckily he don't like when he hit </v>

2631
01:57:05.281 --> 01:57:08.060
<v Speaker 4>the brakes he was texting of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when he,</v>

2632
01:57:08.061 --> 01:57:10.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and traffic was stopped and he looked up</v>

2633
01:57:10.681 --> 01:57:11.514
<v Speaker 4>and I saw him look up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw him in the rear view mirror and I </v>

2634
01:57:13.111 --> 01:57:13.920
<v Speaker 4>saw his face.</v>

2635
01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:15.450
<v Speaker 4>I saw him slam on the brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2636
01:57:15.451 --> 01:57:16.284
<v Speaker 4>this guy's going to hit me for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he had a Honda civic and his car </v>

2637
01:57:20.041 --> 01:57:21.810
<v Speaker 4>went under my car because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2638
01:57:21.890 --> 01:57:22.950
<v Speaker 4>when you break dive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2639
01:57:22.951 --> 01:57:24.640
<v Speaker 4>your car dips down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2640
01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:29.160
<v Speaker 4>So his car literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ran into my car but kind of lifted it up</v>

2641
01:57:29.161 --> 01:57:30.860
<v Speaker 4>and sent me a flying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2642
01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:33.790
<v Speaker 4>he sent me fine and crushed his car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2643
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:37.620
<v Speaker 4>but it was luckily that he had a light </v>
<v Speaker 4>car and it damaged my car,</v>

2644
01:57:37.621 --> 01:57:39.030
<v Speaker 4>but they will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they fixed it pretty quickly,</v>

2645
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:44.750
<v Speaker 4>but at that moment I got out of the car </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was in the best state of mind that</v>

2646
01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:45.893
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had been doing a lot of yoga and it </v>

2647
01:57:47.461 --> 01:57:48.750
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything was going good.</v>

2648
01:57:48.751 --> 01:57:51.670
<v Speaker 4>I was feeling positive and generous and </v>
<v Speaker 4>friendly and I,</v>

2649
01:57:51.671 --> 01:57:53.700
<v Speaker 4>I talked to him and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2650
01:57:53.701 --> 01:57:54.570
<v Speaker 4>do you have a license?</v>

2651
01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:55.433
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2654
01:57:57.271 --> 01:57:58.440
<v Speaker 4>And he was honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I gotta work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2656

<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what I did because we </v>

2659
01:58:09.001 --> 01:58:10.110
<v Speaker 4>pulled out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his car was fucked.</v>

2660

<v Speaker 4>My car drove to the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I drove that night but I was going to </v>

<v Speaker 4>and tell the cops that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2677
01:58:48.401 --> 01:58:49.780
<v Speaker 4>could've been in a terrible state of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>

2678
01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:53.020
<v Speaker 4>I could have been ramped up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could have gotten in some altercation,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that people find so disturbing about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this trump ban on immigrants.</v>

2720
02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:37.753
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now they're telling you they're not </v>

2721
02:00:38.231 --> 02:00:39.064
<v Speaker 4>calling it a band anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but seth meyers is the hilarious thing </v>

2722
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:42.183
<v Speaker 4>where they were saying that it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>band that he showed all these clips of </v>

2723
02:00:45.490 --> 02:00:48.970
<v Speaker 4>pence and trump and all these different </v>
<v Speaker 4>people calling it a band,</v>

2724
02:00:48.971 --> 02:00:50.050
<v Speaker 4>a band,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the band,</v>

2725
02:00:50.051 --> 02:00:51.100
<v Speaker 4>the band,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the band,</v>

2726
02:00:51.101 --> 02:00:52.780
<v Speaker 4>the band,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

2727
02:00:53.140 --> 02:00:53.973
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it hurts people when you know that this </v>

2728
02:00:55.541 --> 02:00:56.374
<v Speaker 4>is a country that was founded on </v>
<v Speaker 4>immigrants and this is a country that </v>

2729
02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:01.193
<v Speaker 4>everyone in this country was originally </v>
<v Speaker 4>an immigrant that was our native </v>

2730
02:01:05.711 --> 02:01:07.210
<v Speaker 4>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Native Americans,</v>

2731
02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:08.313
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're fucking immigrants too because </v>

2732
02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:11.440
<v Speaker 4>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>

2733
02:01:11.441 --> 02:01:13.810
<v Speaker 4>this entire country was covered by two </v>
<v Speaker 4>miles of ice.</v>

2734
02:01:14.090 --> 02:01:14.771
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2735
02:01:14.771 --> 02:01:15.400
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2736
02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:16.233
<v Speaker 4>everyone came here from somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean is in terms of recent humans we </v>

2737
02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:23.710
<v Speaker 4>recent being the last 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

2738
02:01:23.711 --> 02:01:24.544
<v Speaker 4>everyone came from somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they do these genetic examinations </v>

2739
02:01:27.521 --> 02:01:29.220
<v Speaker 4>of native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things they find is they,</v>

2740
02:01:29.230 --> 02:01:30.063
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they share common ancestors in Siberia </v>

2741
02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:36.850
<v Speaker 4>means they came across the bering strait</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it was connected.</v>

2742
02:01:36.850 --> 02:01:40.310
<v Speaker 4>And this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the price where people come.</v>

2743
02:01:40.370 --> 02:01:41.480
<v Speaker 4>That's our idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2744
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:42.343
<v Speaker 4>so when you're blocking these people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are in one of the worst places in </v>

2745
02:01:45.111 --> 02:01:46.170
<v Speaker 4>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Syria,</v>

2746
02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:48.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there was like this list of all</v>

2747
02:01:48.891 --> 02:01:49.724
<v Speaker 4>these Muslim countries where people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed to come into America problems </v>

2748
02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:53.673
<v Speaker 4>and there's so many fucking people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so many different countries that are </v>

2749
02:01:56.571 --> 02:01:57.404
<v Speaker 4>Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's whether it's Pakistan or </v>

2750
02:01:59.090 --> 02:01:59.923
<v Speaker 4>Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then there's politics involved in </v>

2751
02:02:01.281 --> 02:02:02.114
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think somebody pointed out that a lot </v>

2752
02:02:03.111 --> 02:02:03.944
<v Speaker 4>of like Saudi Arabia or wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are places where there are trump </v>

2753
02:02:05.781 --> 02:02:06.760
<v Speaker 4>hotels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2754
02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:07.613
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's true either,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the real issue is Syria is the hot </v>

2755
02:02:10.641 --> 02:02:13.880
<v Speaker 4>topic and I don't necessarily think this</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy has the time,</v>

2756
02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:17.450
<v Speaker 4>nor does he have the inclination to </v>
<v Speaker 4>deeply look into things with a,</v>

2757
02:02:17.550 --> 02:02:21.230
<v Speaker 4>a greater perspective than what he </v>
<v Speaker 4>currently has.</v>

2758
02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:23.240
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would think that,</v>

2759
02:02:23.241 --> 02:02:24.074
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Howard stern had a very interesting </v>

2760
02:02:24.681 --> 02:02:28.340
<v Speaker 4>thing that he said about Donald Trump </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I would defer to him because I think</v>

2761
02:02:28.341 --> 02:02:29.174
<v Speaker 4>he knows Donald Trump personally and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>said that he doesn't think that this is </v>

2762
02:02:32.241 --> 02:02:34.640
<v Speaker 4>good for Donald.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like his mental health,</v>

2763
02:02:34.670 --> 02:02:35.503
<v Speaker 4>which I thought it was interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>because Howard was coming at it like as </v>

2764
02:02:36.891 --> 02:02:40.700
<v Speaker 4>a friend and he said essentially the </v>
<v Speaker 4>donald wants to be loved,</v>

2765
02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:41.893
<v Speaker 4>and he said that that's what he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these people that love him and he's </v>

2766
02:02:43.911 --> 02:02:44.744
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think this is a good job for </v>

2767
02:02:46.041 --> 02:02:47.390
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For his mind.</v>

2768
02:02:47.420 --> 02:02:51.740
<v Speaker 4>I know it's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is crazy.</v>

2769
02:02:51.741 --> 02:02:53.660
<v Speaker 4>I remember when Chappelle hosted snl and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>

2770
02:02:53.661 --> 02:02:56.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to give him a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we were putting ourselves.</v>

2771
02:02:56.301 --> 02:02:57.134
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those of us that weren't on board with </v>

2772
02:02:58.611 --> 02:02:59.191
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were there.</v>

2773
02:02:59.191 --> 02:03:02.450
<v Speaker 4>We only have this one thing that's right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now the disturbing thing,</v>

2774
02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:03.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2775
02:03:03.050 --> 02:03:03.883
<v Speaker 4>There's not really a lot of other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this one that the ban on </v>

2776
02:03:06.261 --> 02:03:07.094
<v Speaker 4>immigrants is really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an issue because there's families </v>

2777
02:03:09.381 --> 02:03:10.214
<v Speaker 4>that are coming over here and they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>children and you see them and they're </v>

2778
02:03:11.931 --> 02:03:13.970
<v Speaker 4>sad and desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's scary.</v>

2779
02:03:14.290 --> 02:03:15.810
<v Speaker 4>You know you're leaving your home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

2780
02:03:15.811 --> 02:03:18.770
<v Speaker 4>your seeking refuge in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a travel visa and you can't get</v>

2781
02:03:18.771 --> 02:03:19.604
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That scares the fuck out of people </v>

2782
02:03:21.291 --> 02:03:24.350
<v Speaker 4>because you think that could be me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could be my mom,</v>

2783
02:03:24.351 --> 02:03:25.870
<v Speaker 4>that could be my sister.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2784
02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:26.713
<v Speaker 4>That was my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My mom fled world war two from </v>

2785
02:03:28.671 --> 02:03:30.020
<v Speaker 4>Lithuania.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

2786
02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:31.070
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

2787
02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:33.050
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is fucking insane.</v>

2788
02:03:33.051 --> 02:03:37.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean it scares the shit out of us when</v>
<v Speaker 4>we think that we could be.</v>

2789
02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:40.580
<v Speaker 4>So Zena phobic that we could just put </v>
<v Speaker 4>this like this blanket statement,</v>

2790
02:03:40.581 --> 02:03:42.470
<v Speaker 4>but let's wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You said earlier it becomes them,</v>

2791
02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:46.430
<v Speaker 4>but on the other side you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's happening in Germany.</v>

2792
02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:48.380
<v Speaker 4>You don't want what's happening in </v>
<v Speaker 4>France.</v>

2793
02:03:48.381 --> 02:03:49.214
<v Speaker 4>You don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have these people that aren't </v>

2794
02:03:50.601 --> 02:03:51.434
<v Speaker 4>integrating with the culture and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>creating these significant problems and </v>

2795
02:03:53.841 --> 02:03:57.830
<v Speaker 4>you have like what Merkel is dealing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with right now in Germany,</v>

2796
02:03:57.831 --> 02:04:01.790
<v Speaker 4>this culture clash and you're having a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of problems between people and these</v>

2797
02:04:01.791 --> 02:04:05.960
<v Speaker 4>radical Muslim elements and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're isolating and creating their own</v>

2798
02:04:05.961 --> 02:04:09.980
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people don't want to integrate.</v>

2799
02:04:09.981 --> 02:04:10.814
<v Speaker 4>They want to bring a piece of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>country here and they have extremely </v>

2800
02:04:13.941 --> 02:04:18.500
<v Speaker 4>different values mean whether you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be critical of these people that live</v>

2801
02:04:18.501 --> 02:04:21.770
<v Speaker 4>in the Middle East or not the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we all know this,</v>

2802
02:04:21.890 --> 02:04:22.723
<v Speaker 4>when you look at the rights that women </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Saudi Arabia or are denied the right </v>

2803
02:04:27.051 --> 02:04:29.600
<v Speaker 4>to drive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to wear certain clothing.</v>

2804
02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:32.720
<v Speaker 4>They have to have to look away when men </v>
<v Speaker 4>are looking at them.</v>

2805
02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:33.733
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a lot of shit that these </v>
<v Speaker 4>women have to deal with that is a </v>

2806
02:04:37.410 --> 02:04:41.430
<v Speaker 4>cultural standard in their part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world that doesn't fly.</v>

2807
02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:42.293
<v Speaker 4>And if they bring that over to Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you see these men that are from </v>

2808
02:04:45.631 --> 02:04:48.030
<v Speaker 4>that part of the world that are in their</v>
<v Speaker 4>thirties or whatever.</v>

2809
02:04:48.031 --> 02:04:48.864
<v Speaker 4>There are grown adults know whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 4>age and that is their standard of </v>

2810
02:04:52.981 --> 02:04:55.590
<v Speaker 4>behavior and now they're seeing white </v>
<v Speaker 4>women in Germany,</v>

2811
02:04:55.591 --> 02:04:56.424
<v Speaker 4>these German women that are not behaving</v>
<v Speaker 4>then not acting in that standard and </v>

2812
02:04:59.641 --> 02:05:02.520
<v Speaker 4>they feel like these women are harlots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They feel like these women are sluts and</v>

2813
02:05:02.521 --> 02:05:03.810
<v Speaker 4>they can just do whatever they want with</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2814
02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:07.290
<v Speaker 4>And you're finding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's not how many of them,</v>

2815
02:05:07.350 --> 02:05:09.030
<v Speaker 4>how many incidents are there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2816
02:05:09.031 --> 02:05:11.340
<v Speaker 4>but there's enough where it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>significant issue.</v>

2817
02:05:11.370 --> 02:05:13.770
<v Speaker 4>There's enough that this is something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that needs to be discussed.</v>

2818
02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:17.490
<v Speaker 4>Like you have these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this new element that you brought in and</v>

2819
02:05:17.491 --> 02:05:19.650
<v Speaker 4>how do you mitigate that without being </v>
<v Speaker 4>racist,</v>

2820
02:05:19.651 --> 02:05:20.660
<v Speaker 4>without being seen in public?</v>

2821
02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:22.170
<v Speaker 4>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you,</v>

2822
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:26.700
<v Speaker 4>how do you somehow or another encourage </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people to evolve their culture?</v>

2823
02:05:27.850 --> 02:05:30.240
<v Speaker 4>Because that's a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is very interesting.</v>

2824
02:05:30.241 --> 02:05:31.074
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it did make me think of the word both </v>

2825
02:05:32.281 --> 02:05:34.260
<v Speaker 4>from Boston and the Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2826
02:05:34.261 --> 02:05:37.130
<v Speaker 4>segregated kept to themselves and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were Irish neighborhoods.</v>

2827
02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:42.510
<v Speaker 4>It gets tricky when something is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>culturally different for us.</v>

2828
02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:45.840
<v Speaker 4>They do have a right to have their </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood be however,</v>

2829
02:05:45.841 --> 02:05:48.900
<v Speaker 4>they weren't sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for some reason it could be racism.</v>

2830
02:05:48.901 --> 02:05:51.780
<v Speaker 4>It could be just a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not normal to us.</v>

2831
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.823
<v Speaker 4>The way that they behave with women or </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that they want women to behave </v>

2832
02:05:55.650 --> 02:05:57.120
<v Speaker 4>that well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not racism.</v>

2833
02:05:57.150 --> 02:05:59.100
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a huge issue.</v>

2834
02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:00.233
<v Speaker 4>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want women to be sublimated and </v>

2835
02:06:02.670 --> 02:06:03.503
<v Speaker 4>what's interesting is that you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that that would be totally in </v>

2836
02:06:07.801 --> 02:06:08.634
<v Speaker 4>opposition of liberal values,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the liberals are the ones that are </v>

2837
02:06:13.341 --> 02:06:17.640
<v Speaker 4>like really concerned with these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with people not being Islamophobic,</v>

2838
02:06:17.790 --> 02:06:18.623
<v Speaker 4>which is also a good thing to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there has to be some rational and </v>

2839
02:06:22.681 --> 02:06:23.514
<v Speaker 4>reasonable consideration for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultural differences that are vast and </v>

2840
02:06:26.611 --> 02:06:31.611
<v Speaker 4>real and scary and also they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredibly restrictive on women.</v>

2841
02:06:31.950 --> 02:06:34.320
<v Speaker 4>Incredibly restrictive and on </v>
<v Speaker 4>homosexuals.</v>

2842
02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:35.453
<v Speaker 4>I mean what you're seeing with isis </v>
<v Speaker 4>thrown gay people off rooftops and in </v>

2843
02:06:39.001 --> 02:06:39.834
<v Speaker 4>Iraq and some horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible shit that is the standard in </v>

2844
02:06:43.591 --> 02:06:44.424
<v Speaker 4>that part of the world and when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with a culture that is just </v>

2845
02:06:49.441 --> 02:06:50.274
<v Speaker 4>perot programmed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>programmed for so long to be oppressive </v>

2846
02:06:53.041 --> 02:06:55.050
<v Speaker 4>towards homosexuals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be oppressive towards women,</v>

2847
02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:57.300
<v Speaker 4>like violently oppressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2848
02:06:57.301 --> 02:06:59.130
<v Speaker 4>where they think you're allowed to beat </v>
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>

2849
02:06:59.131 --> 02:06:59.964
<v Speaker 4>I watched one of the most horrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>videos and I should have never watched </v>

2850
02:07:02.251 --> 02:07:03.084
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was a a man and his daughter and </v>

2851
02:07:07.111 --> 02:07:07.944
<v Speaker 4>the daughter had been accused of </v>
<v Speaker 4>adultery and so he was going to be the </v>

2852
02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:12.873
<v Speaker 4>guy there was stoning his daughter to </v>
<v Speaker 4>death and he was the first guy to throw </v>

2853
02:07:15.781 --> 02:07:16.614
<v Speaker 4>the stone and his daughter was begging </v>
<v Speaker 4>for mercy and reaching out to touch his </v>

2854
02:07:20.221 --> 02:07:21.054
<v Speaker 4>hand and he wouldn't touch her hand and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he hit her with the Rock and then they </v>

2855
02:07:23.221 --> 02:07:24.750
<v Speaker 4>all through the rock center and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2856
02:07:24.751 --> 02:07:28.050
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just a religion.</v>

2857
02:07:28.110 --> 02:07:28.943
<v Speaker 4>Just an ideology that forces people into</v>
<v Speaker 4>this and if you take these people that </v>

2858
02:07:32.311 --> 02:07:33.144
<v Speaker 4>are so deep in that ideology and so deep</v>
<v Speaker 4>that brainwashing and then you bring </v>

2859
02:07:36.521 --> 02:07:37.354
<v Speaker 4>them over to a free country to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>democratic country that has an open </v>

2860
02:07:41.621 --> 02:07:44.740
<v Speaker 4>policy on religion and freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 4>expression.</v>

2861
02:07:44.770 --> 02:07:46.370
<v Speaker 4>Do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna.</v>

2862
02:07:46.390 --> 02:07:48.100
<v Speaker 4>Have A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna have a problem.</v>

2863
02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:49.053
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be some sort of a gap </v>
<v Speaker 4>that needs to be crossed and I don't </v>

2864
02:07:53.231 --> 02:07:54.670
<v Speaker 4>know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you.</v>

2865
02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:57.130
<v Speaker 4>How do you make those people evolve?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their ideas?</v>

2866
02:07:57.131 --> 02:07:58.150
<v Speaker 4>I just don't know.</v>

2867
02:08:00.370 --> 02:08:01.630
<v Speaker 4>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even.</v>

2868
02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:02.613
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you think about people coming </v>

2869
02:08:04.121 --> 02:08:08.260
<v Speaker 4>into this country hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were new at this and there's gonna be</v>

2870
02:08:09.070 --> 02:08:12.550
<v Speaker 4>mistakes and there's going to be things </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that seem unsolvable problems.</v>

2871
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:13.623
<v Speaker 4>There is the human life element of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know that there's a basis of like </v>

2872
02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:19.060
<v Speaker 4>people are dying and they need help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2873
02:08:19.150 --> 02:08:19.811
<v Speaker 4>and then we go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2874
02:08:19.811 --> 02:08:22.570
<v Speaker 4>people that we may not agree with her </v>
<v Speaker 4>dying and need help,</v>

2875
02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:25.690
<v Speaker 4>but you still go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't need to take lsd to go,</v>

2876
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.823
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you still need to help people that you </v>

2877
02:08:27.461 --> 02:08:28.630
<v Speaker 4>don't agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right,</v>

2878
02:08:28.750 --> 02:08:29.583
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not the issue and the vast </v>

2879
02:08:31.271 --> 02:08:32.980
<v Speaker 4>majority,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's be really clear,</v>

2880
02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:37.420
<v Speaker 4>are never going to cause any problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The vast majority are going to integrate</v>

2881
02:08:37.421 --> 02:08:38.254
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to have friends that are </v>

2882
02:08:38.891 --> 02:08:41.890
<v Speaker 4>Christians and baptists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mormons and whatever,</v>

2883
02:08:41.891 --> 02:08:43.020
<v Speaker 4>and then there's going to be no issues.</v>

2884
02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:45.580
<v Speaker 4>The vast majority,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is going to be.</v>

2885
02:08:45.610 --> 02:08:48.910
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be a few issues and </v>
<v Speaker 4>when those issues pop up,</v>

2886
02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:51.160
<v Speaker 4>then it always becomes highlighted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2887
02:08:51.161 --> 02:08:53.080
<v Speaker 4>it's their religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's their ideology,</v>

2888
02:08:53.260 --> 02:08:55.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be mental health issues.</v>

2889
02:08:55.870 --> 02:08:59.070
<v Speaker 4>They just overturn something here in </v>
<v Speaker 4>America though that it was like,</v>

2890
02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:01.360
<v Speaker 4>it's no longer a federal or I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

2891
02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:02.253
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the legal speak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's no longer as serious of an </v>

2892
02:09:04.331 --> 02:09:06.130
<v Speaker 4>offense as it used to be to beat your </v>
<v Speaker 4>wife.</v>

2893
02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:09.520
<v Speaker 4>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was actually in Egypt.</v>

2894
02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:11.350
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where was it was just.</v>

2895
02:09:11.650 --> 02:09:13.700
<v Speaker 4>It was just a law that was just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on a second.</v>

2896
02:09:13.701 --> 02:09:16.930
<v Speaker 4>There was just a law that was just past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where the fuck was that?</v>

2897
02:09:19.190 --> 02:09:21.550
<v Speaker 4>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tweeted about it.</v>

2898
02:09:21.580 --> 02:09:22.900
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Russia was in Russia.</v>

2899
02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:24.130
<v Speaker 4>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Russia.</v>

2900
02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:25.383
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

2901
02:09:25.420 --> 02:09:26.253
<v Speaker 4>Like domestic violence is decriminalized</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Russia if it doesn't cause severe </v>

2902
02:09:29.381 --> 02:09:30.460
<v Speaker 4>injury.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We also,</v>

2903
02:09:30.461 --> 02:09:35.461
<v Speaker 4>what I'm saying is we also have people </v>
<v Speaker 4>here that are very backwards about women</v>

2904
02:09:36.071 --> 02:09:36.904
<v Speaker 4>and gays,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we have plenty of them and they're </v>

2905
02:09:39.551 --> 02:09:40.384
<v Speaker 4>also here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to advocate the Saudis </v>

2906
02:09:44.110 --> 02:09:44.943
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of the Middle Eastern </v>
<v Speaker 4>countries take that shit to a whole new </v>

2907
02:09:47.081 --> 02:09:49.390
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I human aren't even allowed to drive.</v>

2908
02:09:49.410 --> 02:09:50.243
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they have to have a male </v>

2909
02:09:51.101 --> 02:09:53.440
<v Speaker 4>companion when they go out at night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2910
02:09:53.441 --> 02:09:54.274
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some unbelievably regressive </v>

2911
02:09:56.111 --> 02:10:00.280
<v Speaker 4>ideas that are just accepted because we </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to appear to be homophobic or</v>

2912
02:10:00.281 --> 02:10:01.450
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Islamophobia.</v>

2913
02:10:01.451 --> 02:10:02.240
<v Speaker 4>And then there's Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2914
02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:03.820
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it Bob Jones?</v>

2915
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:07.540
<v Speaker 4>There's a Christian university where </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's blue sidewalls for boys and pink</v>

2916
02:10:07.541 --> 02:10:08.350
<v Speaker 4>for girls.</v>

2917
02:10:08.350 --> 02:10:10.480
<v Speaker 4>So everybody's fucked what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2918
02:10:10.481 --> 02:10:13.640
<v Speaker 4>But they're not stoning people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not having a fighter.</v>

2919
02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:15.940
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2920
02:10:15.941 --> 02:10:17.600
<v Speaker 4>you just scarred me emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Honor,</v>

2921
02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:20.350
<v Speaker 4>killing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Honor killing is a real thing.</v>

2922
02:10:20.370 --> 02:10:22.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is not,</v>

2923
02:10:22.450 --> 02:10:25.780
<v Speaker 4>this is not like an imaginary idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's never enforced.</v>

2924
02:10:25.781 --> 02:10:29.260
<v Speaker 4>It's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's female genital mutilation.</v>

2925
02:10:29.580 --> 02:10:34.580
<v Speaker 4>He talked to Ian Hirsi Ali about it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she gets labeled in Islamophobia because</v>

2926
02:10:35.031 --> 02:10:35.864
<v Speaker 4>she talks openly about the problems with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ideology and she's a woman who </v>

2927
02:10:39.951 --> 02:10:42.470
<v Speaker 4>experienced female genital mutilation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean she was,</v>

2928
02:10:42.750 --> 02:10:43.583
<v Speaker 4>that she had to flee her country and now</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's here writing books and giving </v>

2929
02:10:46.611 --> 02:10:49.340
<v Speaker 4>lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the hardcore left the far left.</v>

2930
02:10:49.341 --> 02:10:52.430
<v Speaker 4>Crazies are attacking her as being </v>
<v Speaker 4>Islamophobic.</v>

2931
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.530
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

2932
02:10:52.530 --> 02:10:54.760
<v Speaker 3>you know what's interesting about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

2933
02:10:54.761 --> 02:10:55.594
<v Speaker 3>very complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've just illuminated me in many </v>

2934
02:10:58.031 --> 02:11:01.360
<v Speaker 3>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a issues is when things get really,</v>

2935
02:11:01.361 --> 02:11:02.194
<v Speaker 3>really complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do take comfort in what I call like </v>

2936
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:07.380
<v Speaker 3>the slingblade mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember slingblade?</v>

2937
02:11:07.381 --> 02:11:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's dad.</v>

2938
02:11:10.140 --> 02:11:12.010
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people call it a kaiser blade.</v>

2939
02:11:12.011 --> 02:11:17.011
<v Speaker 3>I call it a sling blade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that movie is like strangely pleasant</v>

2940
02:11:17.890 --> 02:11:18.723
<v Speaker 3>in this weird way because the boy has </v>
<v Speaker 3>the abusive father and the mother and </v>

2941
02:11:22.751 --> 02:11:25.540
<v Speaker 3>they're being held captive by this drunk</v>
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>

2942
02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:27.430
<v Speaker 3>Spoiler alert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's from the nineties.</v>

2943
02:11:27.431 --> 02:11:29.020
<v Speaker 3>You should have seen that by now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2944
02:11:29.370 --> 02:11:30.203
<v Speaker 3>Incomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A simple man who is a graceful </v>

2945
02:11:32.681 --> 02:11:34.420
<v Speaker 3>character,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a compassionate character,</v>

2946
02:11:34.630 --> 02:11:35.463
<v Speaker 3>and he kills the dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hits him in the head with a sling </v>

2947
02:11:37.691 --> 02:11:38.524
<v Speaker 3>blade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why the movie's called Sling </v>

2948
02:11:39.610 --> 02:11:42.580
<v Speaker 3>Blade and he kills the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it is this complicated thing.</v>

2949
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:44.980
<v Speaker 3>The drunk dad is a person.</v>

2950
02:11:44.980 --> 02:11:47.260
<v Speaker 3>We could zoom out on him and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2951
02:11:47.261 --> 02:11:48.820
<v Speaker 3>why is he drinking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>

2952
02:11:48.821 --> 02:11:51.190
<v Speaker 3>How can we help them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can we rehabilitate this guy?</v>

2953
02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:55.840
<v Speaker 3>But there's something about being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human that occasionally John Wick style,</v>

2954
02:11:56.020 --> 02:11:58.900
<v Speaker 3>you just want a guy to go in and shoot a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of a bunch of people.</v>

2955
02:11:58.930 --> 02:12:00.940
<v Speaker 3>Just clean the problem up in a simple </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2956
02:12:00.941 --> 02:12:02.440
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Punch Nazis.</v>

2957
02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:04.030
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

2958
02:12:04.150 --> 02:12:09.150
<v Speaker 3>So complicated issues somehow attract </v>
<v Speaker 3>overly simple response,</v>

2959
02:12:10.091 --> 02:12:12.000
<v Speaker 3>especially because people are lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what.</v>

2960
02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:13.840
<v Speaker 3>That's where racism comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Go.</v>

2961
02:12:13.841 --> 02:12:16.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid that some people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>

2962
02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:17.703
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys say black people are </v>

2963
02:12:18.431 --> 02:12:19.450
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

2964
02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:20.433
<v Speaker 3>I feel a little bit more comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I look around the store and </v>

2965
02:12:22.721 --> 02:12:24.430
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of them would really.</v>

2966
02:12:24.431 --> 02:12:25.264
<v Speaker 3>There's a white guy that'll fuck you up </v>
<v Speaker 3>just as bad as anybody in that same </v>

2967
02:12:28.271 --> 02:12:28.900
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>

2968
02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:31.750
<v Speaker 3>But we're looking for these click </v>
<v Speaker 3>moments where we just go,</v>

2969
02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:34.000
<v Speaker 3>John Wick shot the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to bed.</v>

2970
02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:35.133
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm actually trying to understand </v>

2971
02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:41.830
<v Speaker 3>trump supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a slingblade thing going</v>

2972
02:12:41.831 --> 02:12:44.080
<v Speaker 3>on with trump where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2973
02:12:44.081 --> 02:12:45.620
<v Speaker 3>what are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people want to come in.</v>

2974
02:12:45.650 --> 02:12:48.160
<v Speaker 3>Nobody likes people dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these people may be.</v>

2975
02:12:48.161 --> 02:12:49.960
<v Speaker 3>There's this threat of this changing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

2976
02:12:49.961 --> 02:12:52.090
<v Speaker 3>changing women being bad this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>violent this way.</v>

2977
02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:53.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just not let them in.</v>

2978
02:12:54.370 --> 02:12:57.370
<v Speaker 3>It's like a panic answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2979
02:12:57.550 --> 02:12:58.383
<v Speaker 3>And it appeals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the things that I find </v>

2980
02:13:01.570 --> 02:13:04.030
<v Speaker 3>not too many people like me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with trump,</v>

2981
02:13:04.900 --> 02:13:05.733
<v Speaker 3>but when I would watch the debates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would catch something in my brain </v>

2982
02:13:08.561 --> 02:13:09.580
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2983
02:13:09.581 --> 02:13:12.070
<v Speaker 3>this guy's driving the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2984
02:13:12.071 --> 02:13:17.071
<v Speaker 3>Like he was such a blow hard and he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>solutions that if I was quiet enough,</v>

2985
02:13:17.530 --> 02:13:20.590
<v Speaker 3>I could recognize the part in my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>psyche that went.</v>

2986
02:13:20.970 --> 02:13:22.030
<v Speaker 3>Data will protect us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2987
02:13:22.031 --> 02:13:22.864
<v Speaker 3>There's the appeal of the strong man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a strong confident man who stands in </v>

2988
02:13:26.021 --> 02:13:29.170
<v Speaker 3>front of all us and tells us he got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we can admit that,</v>

2989
02:13:29.260 --> 02:13:30.970
<v Speaker 3>and I'm trying to admit that as much as </v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2990
02:13:31.770 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 3>then</v>

2991
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:36.300
<v Speaker 1>we don't see my sister getting pepper </v>
<v Speaker 1>sprayed by my brother.</v>

2992
02:13:36.330 --> 02:13:38.220
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're all in it together.</v>

2993
02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:40.830
<v Speaker 1>That's what I talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good discourse.</v>

2994
02:13:41.070 --> 02:13:44.760
<v Speaker 1>We need to go like Jon Stewart was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys aren't afraid of Muslims.</v>

2995
02:13:44.761 --> 02:13:46.710
<v Speaker 1>They're afraid of their health insurance</v>
<v Speaker 1>premiums.</v>

2996
02:13:46.711 --> 02:13:48.720
<v Speaker 1>That was such a great quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

2997
02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:52.380
<v Speaker 1>this plan was fucking them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't afford their insulin,</v>

2998
02:13:52.590 --> 02:13:54.720
<v Speaker 1>so trump comes in and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it.</v>

2999
02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:56.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get you jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get you this.</v>

3000
02:13:56.371 --> 02:13:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get you that and some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

3001
02:13:58.081 --> 02:13:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Some hateful stuff is coming along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3002
02:13:59.851 --> 02:14:02.490
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't have the luxury of of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being like,</v>

3003
02:14:02.491 --> 02:14:04.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to go with Hillary.</v>

3004
02:14:04.710 --> 02:14:06.840
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3005
02:14:06.841 --> 02:14:07.674
<v Speaker 1>simplistic speak and when you're in it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from someone that holds the </v>

3006
02:14:11.461 --> 02:14:12.294
<v Speaker 1>highest of high offices in our country </v>
<v Speaker 1>is very dangerous because if you </v>

3007
02:14:15.481 --> 02:14:20.481
<v Speaker 1>simplify things and say them in sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a a just a kind of a block headed way.</v>

3008
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It appeals to blockheads football game.</v>

3009
02:14:24.001 --> 02:14:24.834
<v Speaker 1>We can't go out there and when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to think now because you're </v>

3010
02:14:29.221 --> 02:14:32.040
<v Speaker 1>not thinking you're the leaders thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a blockhead.</v>

3011
02:14:32.070 --> 02:14:32.903
<v Speaker 1>That's what I can think like a blockhead</v>
<v Speaker 1>to when Obama became president and I </v>

3012
02:14:35.731 --> 02:14:38.460
<v Speaker 1>loved Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't follow too closely,</v>

3013
02:14:38.461 --> 02:14:39.294
<v Speaker 1>so I'm kind of a doofus in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I loved the man that he was and he </v>

3014
02:14:41.731 --> 02:14:42.564
<v Speaker 1>seemed to do a good job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he definitely inspired a lot of </v>

3015
02:14:45.151 --> 02:14:46.470
<v Speaker 1>young black people to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3016
02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:48.680
<v Speaker 1>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This could happen for me.</v>

3017
02:14:48.690 --> 02:14:51.090
<v Speaker 1>I could be the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that example,</v>

3018
02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:53.550
<v Speaker 1>and now I do think there is a risk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being like,</v>

3019
02:14:53.551 --> 02:14:55.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this guy who calls,</v>

3020
02:14:55.051 --> 02:14:57.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's her name of fat ass and a pig?</v>

3021
02:14:57.961 --> 02:14:59.460
<v Speaker 1>And he became president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3022
02:14:59.730 --> 02:15:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Who are you to tell me not to bully this</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid in my class?</v>

3023
02:15:03.300 --> 02:15:06.300
<v Speaker 1>I could be the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called him a homo.</v>

3024
02:15:06.450 --> 02:15:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I can be the leader of the free world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous.</v>

3025
02:15:09.860 --> 02:15:10.693
<v Speaker 1>That becomes dangerous when you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's the spokesperson who </v>

3026
02:15:13.981 --> 02:15:15.240
<v Speaker 1>speaks in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3027
02:15:15.241 --> 02:15:16.730
<v Speaker 1>these simplistic terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3028
02:15:17.220 --> 02:15:20.640
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at what Obama really </v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

3029
02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:25.560
<v Speaker 1>there was a bunch of issues where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't buck the system where he did have</v>

3030
02:15:25.561 --> 02:15:26.394
<v Speaker 1>the most drone strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have any president ever where he did </v>

3031
02:15:28.561 --> 02:15:29.394
<v Speaker 1>crack down on whistle blowers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right where he did the opposite of what </v>

3032
02:15:31.681 --> 02:15:32.514
<v Speaker 1>he said and his hope and change website </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we wound up pulling that down </v>

3033
02:15:35.490 --> 02:15:36.323
<v Speaker 1>because he had this whole segment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there about whistleblowers and </v>

3034
02:15:38.461 --> 02:15:39.294
<v Speaker 1>protecting whistleblowers who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that there's some sort of </v>

3035
02:15:41.820 --> 02:15:42.653
<v Speaker 1>illegal activity going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not the case at all because </v>

3036
02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:48.090
<v Speaker 1>everything that Edward Snowden did was </v>
<v Speaker 1>show illegal activity.</v>

3037
02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:50.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of exonerated Chelsea Manning,</v>

3038
02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:51.713
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is going to have that kind of </v>

3039
02:15:52.861 --> 02:15:53.694
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

3040
02:15:53.730 --> 02:15:57.030
<v Speaker 1>That's why I can't pick it up or lay it </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

3041
02:15:57.031 --> 02:15:59.640
<v Speaker 1>You just have to look at it and allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3042
02:15:59.641 --> 02:16:03.390
<v Speaker 1>There's some bullshit right away because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I see Obama,</v>

3043
02:16:03.420 --> 02:16:06.990
<v Speaker 1>some great vine of him meeting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball player and they do this whole</v>

3044
02:16:06.991 --> 02:16:09.510
<v Speaker 1>shake and play some of them and he's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>coolest guy.</v>

3045
02:16:09.810 --> 02:16:12.960
<v Speaker 1>He's articulate as he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's intelligent and he and he looks</v>

3046
02:16:12.961 --> 02:16:14.760
<v Speaker 1>cool and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3047
02:16:14.761 --> 02:16:15.594
<v Speaker 1>That guy also that morning had a meeting</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they decided how many drones to </v>

3048
02:16:19.330 --> 02:16:20.250
<v Speaker 1>roll up shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3049
02:16:20.251 --> 02:16:22.290
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dakota access pipeline,</v>

3050
02:16:22.291 --> 02:16:26.370
<v Speaker 1>all that shit went down when he was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president when they were making those,</v>

3051
02:16:26.660 --> 02:16:29.290
<v Speaker 1>those will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're cutting through private property</v>

3052
02:16:29.291 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 1>in arresting</v>

3053
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:30.903
<v Speaker 4>ranchers because these ranchers did not </v>
<v Speaker 4>want this fucking pipe going through </v>

3054
02:16:34.481 --> 02:16:35.314
<v Speaker 4>their water system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was all in his watch and he </v>

3055
02:16:38.050 --> 02:16:39.310
<v Speaker 4>could've stopped that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He could've.</v>

3056
02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:40.300
<v Speaker 4>He could've stepped in.</v>

3057
02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:43.930
<v Speaker 3>That's Kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets overwhelming and then we go,</v>

3058
02:16:43.931 --> 02:16:46.270
<v Speaker 3>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone is corrupt.</v>

3059
02:16:46.271 --> 02:16:47.104
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's bought and paid for and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where you get people not voting </v>

3060
02:16:49.931 --> 02:16:53.980
<v Speaker 3>and that's when you get people going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's let's light a Molotov cocktail and</v>

3061
02:16:53.981 --> 02:16:57.160
<v Speaker 3>get somebody like trump in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he seemed like in the voting</v>

3062
02:16:57.161 --> 02:16:57.994
<v Speaker 3>booth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like status quo or brick through </v>

3063
02:16:59.681 --> 02:17:03.310
<v Speaker 3>the window and people were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets overwhelming and there's nothing</v>

3064
02:17:03.311 --> 02:17:04.780
<v Speaker 3>more simple than a brick through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>window.</v>

3065
02:17:04.850 --> 02:17:05.451
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing,</v>

3066
02:17:05.451 --> 02:17:07.700
<v Speaker 4>another thing that you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about earlier when you were saying about</v>

3067
02:17:07.730 --> 02:17:08.563
<v Speaker 4>arrested development,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I do agree that I think we are in a </v>

3068
02:17:10.581 --> 02:17:14.040
<v Speaker 4>sense in as a culture and human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

3069
02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:15.113
<v Speaker 4>There's a great propensity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>propensity to exhibit signs of arrested </v>

3070
02:17:17.931 --> 02:17:18.764
<v Speaker 4>development.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the reasons for that is </v>

3071
02:17:20.421 --> 02:17:21.254
<v Speaker 4>that we have to work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think working like doing a job that </v>

3072
02:17:24.351 --> 02:17:25.184
<v Speaker 4>you just don't want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you have to do because you have to </v>

3073
02:17:26.421 --> 02:17:31.421
<v Speaker 4>feed yourself is one of the most soul </v>
<v Speaker 4>sucking and mind numbing activities that</v>

3074
02:17:33.021 --> 02:17:33.854
<v Speaker 4>a person could be trapped into doing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you look at how many kids in this </v>

3075
02:17:36.891 --> 02:17:37.724
<v Speaker 4>country are graduating in great debt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in massive debt because of student </v>

3076
02:17:42.141 --> 02:17:42.974
<v Speaker 4>loans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they get into credit card debt </v>

3077
02:17:44.151 --> 02:17:44.984
<v Speaker 4>that sort bounce out their student loans</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know they're deep into their </v>

3078
02:17:47.511 --> 02:17:49.610
<v Speaker 4>thirties and they're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're in prison,</v>

3079
02:17:49.670 --> 02:17:50.503
<v Speaker 4>they're in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're working all day doing </v>

3080
02:17:51.921 --> 02:17:52.754
<v Speaker 4>something they don't want to do and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to behave in a way that's not </v>

3081
02:17:54.921 --> 02:17:57.910
<v Speaker 4>natural because it's the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>keep this fucking stupid job.</v>

3082
02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:01.270
<v Speaker 4>They never get to express themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 4>a really honest and true way and</v>

3083
02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:03.130
<v Speaker 3>no mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a hippy idea.</v>

3084
02:18:03.131 --> 02:18:06.160
<v Speaker 3>We're all here to create.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the world is.</v>

3085
02:18:06.161 --> 02:18:09.140
<v Speaker 3>The world is creation and we're here to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take our insides and bring it.</v>

3086
02:18:09.170 --> 02:18:10.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's certainly.</v>

3087
02:18:10.280 --> 02:18:11.113
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if we're here for that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it certainly feels better to do </v>

3088
02:18:13.101 --> 02:18:13.934
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you wanted to look at the </v>

3089
02:18:14.421 --> 02:18:18.710
<v Speaker 4>greater picture of organic life on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>planet and like,</v>

3090
02:18:18.711 --> 02:18:19.580
<v Speaker 4>why are we here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3091
02:18:19.581 --> 02:18:20.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why.</v>

3092
02:18:20.630 --> 02:18:22.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't think anybody knows.</v>

3093
02:18:22.881 --> 02:18:23.714
<v Speaker 4>I think you could come up with all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 4>of rationalizations for why we're here </v>

3094
02:18:26.210 --> 02:18:28.180
<v Speaker 4>and what we're doing and what our </v>
<v Speaker 4>purpose is,</v>

3095
02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:29.153
<v Speaker 4>but is that purpose really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we have a finite existence and </v>

3096
02:18:31.401 --> 02:18:32.234
<v Speaker 4>will give birth to other things with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>finite existences and during the time </v>

3097
02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:36.910
<v Speaker 4>they're alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire organism,</v>

3098
02:18:36.911 --> 02:18:37.744
<v Speaker 4>a super organism of human beings is </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to innovate and constantly </v>

3099
02:18:40.671 --> 02:18:41.504
<v Speaker 4>continue to innovate at this exponential</v>
<v Speaker 4>rate where we're going to be </v>

3100
02:18:43.251 --> 02:18:44.084
<v Speaker 4>unrecognizable and a thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't even know what the fuck the </v>

3101
02:18:46.431 --> 02:18:48.650
<v Speaker 4>human race is going to look like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand years from now.</v>

3102
02:18:48.980 --> 02:18:51.260
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know if that's what we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>here for,</v>

3103
02:18:51.261 --> 02:18:53.810
<v Speaker 4>but I certainly know that if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a happy,</v>

3104
02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:55.790
<v Speaker 4>it feels fulfilling life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3105
02:18:55.970 --> 02:18:56.803
<v Speaker 4>Being a creative person or by creative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean you have to be a </v>

3106
02:19:00.861 --> 02:19:02.250
<v Speaker 4>musician,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be an architect.</v>

3107
02:19:02.330 --> 02:19:04.490
<v Speaker 3>The way that your appearance that can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>creative,</v>

3108
02:19:04.491 --> 02:19:07.460
<v Speaker 3>it's just finding a way to bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

3109
02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:10.310
<v Speaker 4>Could be a bay under the executive love </v>
<v Speaker 4>making cookies.</v>

3110
02:19:10.311 --> 02:19:12.990
<v Speaker 4>You can like making tables or clocks </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

3111
02:19:13.170 --> 02:19:17.530
<v Speaker 4>A cool clock say to the guy probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>feels fulfilled as fuck.</v>

3112
02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:18.373
<v Speaker 4>He could be a knife maker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels really good to be a part of </v>

3113
02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:22.513
<v Speaker 4>creation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does into an end or a carpenter or </v>

3114
02:19:24.621 --> 02:19:26.930
<v Speaker 4>anything where you're doing something </v>
<v Speaker 4>feels.</v>

3115
02:19:27.290 --> 02:19:28.040
<v Speaker 4>There's lots of</v>

3116
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:28.873
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very interested in the idea of </v>

3117
02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:32.120
<v Speaker 1>giving us everything that we think we </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

3118
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:34.190
<v Speaker 1>We want food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want entertainment,</v>

3119
02:19:34.191 --> 02:19:38.330
<v Speaker 1>and then you have people staying in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their houses that become like prisons.</v>

3120
02:19:38.331 --> 02:19:40.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've heard that idea.</v>

3121
02:19:40.460 --> 02:19:41.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3122
02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:44.000
<v Speaker 1>let's say it doesn't have to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Illuminati,</v>

3123
02:19:44.001 --> 02:19:44.834
<v Speaker 1>but let's say this world certainly runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>better when we can keep the cattle like </v>

3124
02:19:49.490 --> 02:19:51.230
<v Speaker 1>occupied and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3125
02:19:51.231 --> 02:19:53.900
<v Speaker 1>so we try to put as many people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison as we can.</v>

3126
02:19:53.901 --> 02:19:56.090
<v Speaker 1>If you see like documentaries like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>13th and stuff,</v>

3127
02:19:56.330 --> 02:19:58.190
<v Speaker 1>that's one way to keep this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This last year,</v>

3128
02:19:58.340 --> 02:19:59.560
<v Speaker 1>well how do we get these meds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3129
02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:02.420
<v Speaker 1>well let's infect them with the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumerism,</v>

3130
02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:05.540
<v Speaker 1>so it's never enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your happiness is always the next thing.</v>

3131
02:20:05.541 --> 02:20:07.250
<v Speaker 1>It's the next tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the next phone,</v>

3132
02:20:07.530 --> 02:20:09.290
<v Speaker 1>it's the next computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the next meal,</v>

3133
02:20:09.291 --> 02:20:10.124
<v Speaker 1>whatever it might be.</v>

3134
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:12.650
<v Speaker 1>The next movie that you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See whatever it could be.</v>

3135
02:20:12.890 --> 02:20:16.610
<v Speaker 1>So you're always in a state of lack </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to keep you buying more money.</v>

3136
02:20:16.940 --> 02:20:19.580
<v Speaker 1>You need more money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need these things.</v>

3137
02:20:19.581 --> 02:20:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3138
02:20:20.871 --> 02:20:23.600
<v Speaker 1>you read the newspaper and drink a glass</v>
<v Speaker 1>of old team.</v>

3139
02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:24.673
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to have a netflix </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscription and you got to have Amazon </v>

3140
02:20:27.051 --> 02:20:29.120
<v Speaker 1>prime and all the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're in debt,</v>

3141
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:29.983
<v Speaker 1>you're chasing it and you're never gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it and then at night you deserve it </v>

3142
02:20:32.901 --> 02:20:33.734
<v Speaker 1>after your shit job to sit on the couch </v>
<v Speaker 1>and zone out and that's how you keep us </v>

3143
02:20:36.951 --> 02:20:38.390
<v Speaker 1>in line as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3144
02:20:38.391 --> 02:20:39.224
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of those people in engineering </v>

3145
02:20:41.481 --> 02:20:42.314
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that thing is a natural human </v>

3146
02:20:43.941 --> 02:20:44.774
<v Speaker 1>inclination and I think it's also forced</v>
<v Speaker 1>along by people that are trying to sell </v>

3147
02:20:48.831 --> 02:20:52.760
<v Speaker 1>you the new lexus or I do want you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy these clothes,</v>

3148
02:20:52.761 --> 02:20:55.880
<v Speaker 1>or do you think wants can be encouraged.</v>

3149
02:20:55.940 --> 02:20:56.773
<v Speaker 1>I think we see that in other cultures </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's not as consumeristic as </v>

3150
02:21:00.340 --> 02:21:01.173
<v Speaker 1>consumers stick is outward as ours is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're certainly surrounded by </v>

3151
02:21:04.671 --> 02:21:07.100
<v Speaker 1>advertising and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A capitalist culture,</v>

3152
02:21:07.370 --> 02:21:08.203
<v Speaker 1>you know when you have capitalism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have people that want to sell you </v>

3153
02:21:10.101 --> 02:21:13.010
<v Speaker 1>the new apple laptop or the new android </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

3154
02:21:13.310 --> 02:21:14.143
<v Speaker 1>they're going to advertise that phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to make it appealing </v>

3155
02:21:15.351 --> 02:21:16.184
<v Speaker 1>because they wanted to sell well and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a really good advertising </v>

3156
02:21:18.681 --> 02:21:21.100
<v Speaker 1>strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sell more stuff and so your.</v>

3157
02:21:21.101 --> 02:21:21.934
<v Speaker 1>Your company becomes more successful but</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not outwardly thinking or even </v>

3158
02:21:24.681 --> 02:21:26.840
<v Speaker 1>inwardly thinking you're going to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>more slaves.</v>

3159
02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:27.913
<v Speaker 1>They're going to make people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced into this consumeristic society </v>

3160
02:21:32.271 --> 02:21:37.271
<v Speaker 1>and forced into this weird world weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>world where you're living every day just</v>

3161
02:21:37.701 --> 02:21:39.410
<v Speaker 1>to buy new stuff and just to get new </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

3162
02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:44.440
<v Speaker 1>It is sort of a symptom of the wrong way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thinking and these traps it's society</v>

3163
02:21:44.641 --> 02:21:45.474
<v Speaker 1>set up for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's necessarily </v>

3164
02:21:47.031 --> 02:21:48.440
<v Speaker 1>engineered in a whole.</v>

3165
02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:49.623
<v Speaker 1>So this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a thing that people gravitate </v>

3166
02:21:52.281 --> 02:21:53.114
<v Speaker 1>towards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea that there's this cabal of </v>

3167
02:21:54.951 --> 02:21:56.470
<v Speaker 1>super geniuses that are running the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

3168
02:21:56.471 --> 02:21:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I want to keep a stupid cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's true.</v>

3169
02:21:59.271 --> 02:22:01.490
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a self fulfilling thing.</v>

3170
02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:06.590
<v Speaker 1>I think we create these walls and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>create this prison.</v>

3171
02:22:06.591 --> 02:22:10.130
<v Speaker 1>We put up these bars and then we put </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves inside and we lock them.</v>

3172
02:22:10.220 --> 02:22:11.053
<v Speaker 1>But this is what's interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms was something that's free and </v>

3173
02:22:13.191 --> 02:22:15.740
<v Speaker 1>something that has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no mushroom three point,</v>

3174
02:22:15.741 --> 02:22:17.230
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to get the new machine,</v>

3175
02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:18.193
<v Speaker 1>but it is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is illegal because good citizens </v>

3176
02:22:20.541 --> 02:22:23.690
<v Speaker 1>don't take psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obedient citizens don't know.</v>

3177
02:22:23.700 --> 02:22:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Was Jeff sessions was talking marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good people don't use marijuana.</v>

3178
02:22:27.901 --> 02:22:28.890
<v Speaker 1>The same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3179
02:22:28.900 --> 02:22:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3180
02:22:29.660 --> 02:22:30.493
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you take that and you get a glimpse </v>

3181
02:22:32.340 --> 02:22:34.840
<v Speaker 1>of real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's very,</v>

3182
02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:37.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of exaggerated and bizarre,</v>

3183
02:22:37.950 --> 02:22:41.610
<v Speaker 1>but you get a sense that what we are and</v>
<v Speaker 1>who we are fundamentally can be very,</v>

3184
02:22:41.611 --> 02:22:43.980
<v Speaker 1>very interesting and worth exploring.</v>

3185
02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:48.300
<v Speaker 1>So to kind of also to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that make the laptop and make</v>

3186
02:22:48.301 --> 02:22:49.134
<v Speaker 1>the ad campaign for the laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think are trying to control the </v>

3187
02:22:51.451 --> 02:22:53.280
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think they like us.</v>

3188
02:22:53.281 --> 02:22:54.114
<v Speaker 1>We're also indoctrinated into a world </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can justify the idea that I'm </v>

3189
02:22:57.451 --> 02:22:59.290
<v Speaker 1>just giving them what they want because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they too are,</v>

3190
02:22:59.450 --> 02:23:02.010
<v Speaker 1>are stuck on that hedonic treadmill of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3191
02:23:02.011 --> 02:23:02.844
<v Speaker 1>I need the next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need this job where I advertise this </v>

3192
02:23:04.921 --> 02:23:06.390
<v Speaker 1>thing so I can go out and buy these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3193
02:23:06.420 --> 02:23:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the case with television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3194
02:23:08.671 --> 02:23:10.260
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with a friend of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

3195
02:23:10.261 --> 02:23:11.940
<v Speaker 1>He was like a super hippie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to tell me,</v>

3196
02:23:11.941 --> 02:23:14.220
<v Speaker 1>you know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck in the United States,</v>

3197
02:23:14.260 --> 02:23:15.093
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their programming people with these </v>

3198
02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:16.853
<v Speaker 1>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're hypnotizing you to watch these </v>

3199
02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:22.380
<v Speaker 1>bullshit programs and you get locked </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it and it's all by design.</v>

3200
02:23:22.380 --> 02:23:23.340
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's why you're wrong.</v>

3201
02:23:23.341 --> 02:23:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Fuck face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work on those Goddamn show,</v>

3202
02:23:25.641 --> 02:23:28.960
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to tell you the funny once </v>
<v Speaker 1>you start writing for TV or like there's</v>

3203
02:23:28.980 --> 02:23:30.270
<v Speaker 1>no scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no.</v>

3204
02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:33.060
<v Speaker 1>There's no cabal of geniuses running and</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3205
02:23:33.061 --> 02:23:33.894
<v Speaker 1>the people that are running these shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>are hooked on other shows there in the </v>

3206
02:23:37.330 --> 02:23:37.800
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3207
02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I've seen game of thrones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hooked,</v>

3208
02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:42.120
<v Speaker 1>and they'll start telling you about all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these fucking shows.</v>

3209
02:23:42.121 --> 02:23:42.954
<v Speaker 1>That day was as much as I love a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy like Matt gradings and the </v>

3210
02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:48.660
<v Speaker 1>and the masons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're these clues about nine slash</v>

3211
02:23:48.661 --> 02:23:49.494
<v Speaker 1>11 and the simpsons and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that can be fun and storytelling as </v>

3212
02:23:52.531 --> 02:23:54.480
<v Speaker 1>such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I started writing for TV shows,</v>

3213
02:23:54.481 --> 02:23:55.261
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3214
02:23:55.261 --> 02:23:57.660
<v Speaker 1>this is just a bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Dummies,</v>

3215
02:23:57.690 --> 02:24:00.450
<v Speaker 1>but regular folks like strange marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny.</v>

3216
02:24:00.451 --> 02:24:03.630
<v Speaker 1>If a homeowner comes in and he's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>blue pants,</v>

3217
02:24:03.631 --> 02:24:04.080
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

3218
02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:04.913
<v Speaker 1>Like right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange marriage of art and </v>

3219
02:24:06.361 --> 02:24:07.530
<v Speaker 1>commerce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3220
02:24:07.531 --> 02:24:08.364
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're creating something and you're </v>

3221
02:24:09.541 --> 02:24:10.374
<v Speaker 1>trying to sell it and as you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sell it then to make ads and they </v>

3222
02:24:12.471 --> 02:24:16.080
<v Speaker 1>make as stupid as what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>

3223
02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:18.540
<v Speaker 1>They're not trying to sell like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think coke coke is trying to make</v>

3224
02:24:18.541 --> 02:24:19.374
<v Speaker 1>a stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3225
02:24:19.470 --> 02:24:21.740
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd think that fucking polar bales,</v>

3226
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:24.050
<v Speaker 1>your buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like Santa Claus drinks.</v>

3227
02:24:24.051 --> 02:24:26.700
<v Speaker 1>They're probably just trying to sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>more shits.</v>

3228
02:24:26.701 --> 02:24:29.880
<v Speaker 1>They can make more money to go golfing </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever the fuck they want to do and</v>

3229
02:24:29.881 --> 02:24:31.900
<v Speaker 1>they don't realize while they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3230
02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we want to enjoy this experience</v>

3231
02:24:34.711 --> 02:24:35.544
<v Speaker 1>as much as we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what we want to do that </v>

3232
02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.750
<v Speaker 1>at our best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right at our best.</v>

3233
02:24:39.751 --> 02:24:42.660
<v Speaker 1>We're toasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're clinking glasses were hugging each</v>

3234
02:24:42.661 --> 02:24:43.590
<v Speaker 1>other at our best.</v>

3235
02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:45.840
<v Speaker 1>We're laughing with friends at our best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're.</v>

3236
02:24:46.150 --> 02:24:50.250
<v Speaker 1>We're just having a good time together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite moments are me and my</v>

3237
02:24:50.251 --> 02:24:51.084
<v Speaker 1>buddies just laughing about something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why comedians are so fun to </v>

3238
02:24:54.991 --> 02:24:55.824
<v Speaker 1>hang out with and that's why I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe she left me for a guy named </v>

3239
02:24:59.611 --> 02:25:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Rocco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We probably had a giant hog.</v>

3240
02:25:02.130 --> 02:25:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I bet he did have a dream to have a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>

3241
02:25:06.380 --> 02:25:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3242
02:25:07.010 --> 02:25:08.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like a lot longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3243
02:25:08.761 --> 02:25:10.410
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it's flat stock stock,</v>

3244
02:25:10.411 --> 02:25:11.244
<v Speaker 1>a couple of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is him called pools and here comes </v>

3245
02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:15.073
<v Speaker 1>my cold pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ruined or is there anything better than </v>

3246
02:25:19.231 --> 02:25:20.064
<v Speaker 1>gaining perspective?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a vonnegut quote where </v>

3247
02:25:21.721 --> 02:25:22.950
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best way to get in,</v>

3248
02:25:23.170 --> 02:25:24.040
<v Speaker 1>get over a woman</v>

3249
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:27.760
<v Speaker 3>is to turn her into fiction and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was something really Cathartic.</v>

3250
02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:28.673
<v Speaker 3>The sort of crashing is fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife's character is completely </v>

3251
02:25:32.471 --> 02:25:34.300
<v Speaker 3>different from my wife that situations </v>
<v Speaker 3>are different,</v>

3252
02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:35.433
<v Speaker 3>but it was still really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an episode with my parents and </v>

3253
02:25:37.811 --> 02:25:38.644
<v Speaker 3>I'm writing them saying the annoying </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and my parents say it's not </v>

3254
02:25:42.340 --> 02:25:44.980
<v Speaker 3>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Mom's in love with me,</v>

3255
02:25:44.981 --> 02:25:48.520
<v Speaker 3>all these things and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this talk about zooming out.</v>

3256
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:50.920
<v Speaker 3>You have like this weird dominion over </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3257
02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:53.250
<v Speaker 3>They call cut and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3258
02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:54.103
<v Speaker 3>that was just pretend that you're in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it's pretend it was like 10 years </v>

3259
02:25:58.001 --> 02:25:59.860
<v Speaker 3>of therapy wrapped into a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

3260
02:25:59.861 --> 02:26:01.960
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you still contact her?</v>

3261
02:26:02.410 --> 02:26:04.160
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not out of hate or anything.</v>

3262
02:26:04.270 --> 02:26:06.440
<v Speaker 3>I tend to move on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just move on.</v>

3263
02:26:06.610 --> 02:26:08.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't talk to accept.</v>

3264
02:26:08.610 --> 02:26:10.420
<v Speaker 3>My Ex's is a very dear friend of mine.</v>

3265
02:26:10.670 --> 02:26:12.940
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the rest of them you're just kind of</v>

3266
02:26:12.941 --> 02:26:13.774
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard because you're intimate with </v>

3267
02:26:15.581 --> 02:26:20.290
<v Speaker 3>somebody and you know you have sex and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you kiss and you hug and you want to.</v>

3268
02:26:21.310 --> 02:26:22.143
<v Speaker 3>It takes a level of maturity but to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>lunch with someone whose breasts you've </v>

3269
02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:29.530
<v Speaker 3>seen and just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you getting the soup?</v>

3270
02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:31.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>

3271
02:26:31.271 --> 02:26:32.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you know,</v>

3272
02:26:32.261 --> 02:26:33.094
<v Speaker 3>they tell you they're in love or they </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you they're getting married or </v>

3273
02:26:34.810 --> 02:26:35.650
<v Speaker 3>having a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3274
02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:36.633
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I'm so glad my ex got </v>

3275
02:26:40.421 --> 02:26:41.950
<v Speaker 3>married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's coming to my wedding and,</v>

3276
02:26:42.020 --> 02:26:43.850
<v Speaker 3>and my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my girlfriend is very,</v>

3277
02:26:43.930 --> 02:26:46.720
<v Speaker 3>very close with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I love it when it works out.</v>

3278
02:26:46.721 --> 02:26:48.250
<v Speaker 3>I never thought I'd be one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3279
02:26:48.690 --> 02:26:50.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's amazing when it works out,</v>

3280
02:26:50.530 --> 02:26:51.520
<v Speaker 3>it works out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

3281
02:26:51.570 --> 02:26:54.640
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that it can't work out as </v>
<v Speaker 3>all silly too.</v>

3282
02:26:54.670 --> 02:26:55.690
<v Speaker 3>Of course it can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3283
02:26:55.691 --> 02:26:56.524
<v Speaker 3>I have friends that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one of my buddies dated this girl </v>

3284
02:26:59.801 --> 02:27:02.380
<v Speaker 3>and then he broke up with her and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>other buddy one I'm marrying her.</v>

3285
02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:05.110
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their friends.</v>

3286
02:27:05.230 --> 02:27:06.820
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does happen.</v>

3287
02:27:06.850 --> 02:27:08.830
<v Speaker 3>It can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It totally can happen.</v>

3288
02:27:08.850 --> 02:27:09.683
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just everybody's not right for </v>

3289
02:27:11.711 --> 02:27:12.850
<v Speaker 3>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3290
02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:15.850
<v Speaker 3>There's certain people that will drive </v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking crazy.</v>

3291
02:27:15.851 --> 02:27:18.100
<v Speaker 3>But to someone out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the perfect person.</v>

3292
02:27:18.101 --> 02:27:19.540
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a funny tee shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3293
02:27:19.541 --> 02:27:22.510
<v Speaker 3>no matter how much you love her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone somewhere is sick of her shit.</v>

3294
02:27:22.570 --> 02:27:25.600
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an old old statement,</v>

3295
02:27:25.601 --> 02:27:27.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

3296
02:27:27.370 --> 02:27:28.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Valid.</v>

3297
02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:31.360
<v Speaker 3>I have lived together for two years now </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just,</v>

3298
02:27:31.450 --> 02:27:33.430
<v Speaker 3>it's just been the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome man.</v>

3299
02:27:33.450 --> 02:27:37.690
<v Speaker 3>Because you found that thing right with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the finger slide into the grooves and it</v>

3300
02:27:37.691 --> 02:27:41.620
<v Speaker 3>works and it's like the idea that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like if it doesn't do it,</v>

3301
02:27:41.621 --> 02:27:42.820
<v Speaker 3>it's because someone's a bad person.</v>

3302
02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:43.481
<v Speaker 3>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3303
02:27:43.481 --> 02:27:45.580
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't say that.</v>

3304
02:27:45.581 --> 02:27:48.590
<v Speaker 3>That's something I try and stay on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You made it weird as much as possible as</v>

3305
02:27:48.610 --> 02:27:50.260
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to hate someone to break </v>
<v Speaker 3>up with them.</v>

3306
02:27:50.500 --> 02:27:51.333
<v Speaker 3>It's good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you had to be throwing plates </v>

3307
02:27:54.581 --> 02:27:55.414
<v Speaker 3>and screaming at each other and </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's an alcoholic and someone </v>

3308
02:27:58.181 --> 02:28:01.150
<v Speaker 3>cheats on somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay to say,</v>

3309
02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:03.950
<v Speaker 3>I do love you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I may regret this.</v>

3310
02:28:03.970 --> 02:28:08.680
<v Speaker 3>Like just concede and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'd like to go and that's okay.</v>

3311
02:28:08.830 --> 02:28:10.750
<v Speaker 3>I just like to be free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you this story.</v>

3312
02:28:11.050 --> 02:28:14.560
<v Speaker 3>I was dating this girl who for me seemed</v>
<v Speaker 3>very crazy.</v>

3313
02:28:14.650 --> 02:28:17.200
<v Speaker 3>I know that gets thrown around a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

3314
02:28:17.201 --> 02:28:18.820
<v Speaker 3>I think this person's a borderline </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality,</v>

3315
02:28:18.821 --> 02:28:22.460
<v Speaker 3>all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this list in my phone,</v>

3316
02:28:22.461 --> 02:28:27.290
<v Speaker 3>in the notes file reasons to break up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was 35,</v>

3317
02:28:27.291 --> 02:28:28.190
<v Speaker 3>45 things.</v>

3318
02:28:28.190 --> 02:28:33.110
<v Speaker 3>It was insane and any one of them would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been enough and I kept adding it to</v>

3319
02:28:33.111 --> 02:28:35.510
<v Speaker 3>it and go to my therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Gary Penn,</v>

3320
02:28:35.511 --> 02:28:38.180
<v Speaker 3>whose book is available now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a joke I make on my podcast.</v>

3321
02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:39.440
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pete,</v>

3322
02:28:39.441 --> 02:28:41.780
<v Speaker 3>you don't need a list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need a list.</v>

3323
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:43.820
<v Speaker 3>And that same week I had talked to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychic.</v>

3324
02:28:43.821 --> 02:28:48.821
<v Speaker 3>I'm not huge into that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I told you I'm a believer and the</v>

3325
02:28:49.671 --> 02:28:54.110
<v Speaker 3>psychic is like someone is looking out </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you in this regard in particular,</v>

3326
02:28:54.111 --> 02:28:56.330
<v Speaker 3>like they're rooting for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not that's true.</v>

3327
02:28:56.540 --> 02:29:00.830
<v Speaker 3>I held onto that and I'm driving from </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy where my therapist is like,</v>

3328
02:29:00.831 --> 02:29:03.080
<v Speaker 3>you don't need a list of reasons to </v>
<v Speaker 3>break up with her,</v>

3329
02:29:03.620 --> 02:29:04.700
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>

3330
02:29:04.701 --> 02:29:05.534
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I get in the car and I think of </v>

3331
02:29:06.021 --> 02:29:06.854
<v Speaker 3>another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the highway and I take out my </v>

3332
02:29:09.051 --> 02:29:13.550
<v Speaker 3>phone and I start writing down the 47th </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason to break up with this person.</v>

3333
02:29:14.090 --> 02:29:15.950
<v Speaker 3>Phone crashes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>restarts,</v>

3334
02:29:16.190 --> 02:29:17.720
<v Speaker 3>opens up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's the same.</v>

3335
02:29:17.990 --> 02:29:19.790
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That note was deleted.</v>

3336
02:29:20.450 --> 02:29:21.283
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And whether or not that's actually </v>

3337
02:29:22.761 --> 02:29:24.500
<v Speaker 3>mystical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just meant something to me.</v>

3338
02:29:24.501 --> 02:29:26.990
<v Speaker 3>It was like fucking a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that's a coincidence,</v>

3339
02:29:26.991 --> 02:29:29.240
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it gave me the courage to be like,</v>

3340
02:29:29.270 --> 02:29:31.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't need a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to bounce,</v>

3341
02:29:32.170 --> 02:29:34.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to bounce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I love you.</v>

3342
02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:36.290
<v Speaker 3>I love you too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like this.</v>

3343
02:29:36.390 --> 02:29:37.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be attached and connected to </v>

3344
02:29:39.001 --> 02:29:41.780
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry we had a good run.</v>

3345
02:29:41.790 --> 02:29:46.790
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we'll let me the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you should be able to like people</v>

3346
02:29:47.461 --> 02:29:48.800
<v Speaker 2>that you don't want to have sex with </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

3347
02:29:48.810 --> 02:29:50.340
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be intimately attached</v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

3348
02:29:50.341 --> 02:29:53.160
<v Speaker 2>And that's the other thing about people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like intimate attachments.</v>

3349
02:29:53.490 --> 02:29:55.380
<v Speaker 2>When you have intimate attachments with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

3350
02:29:55.381 --> 02:29:56.890
<v Speaker 2>like you have sex with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3351
02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.850
<v Speaker 2>You share carnal pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

3352
02:29:59.851 --> 02:30:04.490
<v Speaker 2>there's some fucking weird things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened where people get angrier.</v>

3353
02:30:04.980 --> 02:30:08.970
<v Speaker 2>You know they get fucking like the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing you can do.</v>

3354
02:30:09.150 --> 02:30:11.910
<v Speaker 2>If you want to really have a fun </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with someone,</v>

3355
02:30:12.650 --> 02:30:16.650
<v Speaker 2>and I've never done this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold off on the sex as long as you can.</v>

3356
02:30:16.651 --> 02:30:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to know the.</v>

3357
02:30:18.491 --> 02:30:21.180
<v Speaker 2>See if you really like each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if you really like each other.</v>

3358
02:30:21.220 --> 02:30:24.120
<v Speaker 2>See if it's not just a thing where you'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>like should have been a Christian here.</v>

3359
02:30:24.600 --> 02:30:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Feels good inside their body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we do,</v>

3360
02:30:27.090 --> 02:30:30.180
<v Speaker 2>but he would court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the worst move.</v>

3361
02:30:30.181 --> 02:30:33.440
<v Speaker 2>The problem is we have this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>desire for sex.</v>

3362
02:30:33.441 --> 02:30:35.520
<v Speaker 2>It's overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3363
02:30:35.521 --> 02:30:38.670
<v Speaker 2>it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this ticking time bomb inside your body.</v>

3364
02:30:38.710 --> 02:30:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Then we'll convince yourself like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>judy is great to have these great.</v>

3365
02:30:41.760 --> 02:30:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Convince Yourself.</v>

3366
02:30:42.780 --> 02:30:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Let's just fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got married to it in a bit.</v>

3367
02:30:45.270 --> 02:30:47.700
<v Speaker 2>We had sex before we got married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he stopped again.</v>

3368
02:30:47.701 --> 02:30:49.650
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't tell him I stopped for awhile.</v>

3369
02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:50.513
<v Speaker 2>Then we stopped because you want it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be good Christians kind of and then we </v>

3370
02:30:53.461 --> 02:30:54.294
<v Speaker 2>knew we were getting married and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to make the wedding night </v>

3371
02:30:55.770 --> 02:30:58.310
<v Speaker 2>special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Held off for a bit.</v>

3372
02:30:58.380 --> 02:31:01.290
<v Speaker 2>I was mostly for guilt and fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably couple of months.</v>

3373
02:31:01.291 --> 02:31:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Six months as Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you guys have cuddle or anything?</v>

3374
02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:06.020
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hand jobs.</v>

3375
02:31:06.040 --> 02:31:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3376
02:31:07.260 --> 02:31:08.760
<v Speaker 2>I definitely gave myself plenty of.</v>

3377
02:31:11.820 --> 02:31:12.653
<v Speaker 3>I know that I got married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember even my father who wasn't </v>

3378
02:31:15.331 --> 02:31:18.360
<v Speaker 3>very religious saying to me it's good to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get married.</v>

3379
02:31:18.361 --> 02:31:20.100
<v Speaker 3>Sex doesn't like you're getting away</v>

3380
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:22.800
<v Speaker 2>with something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this latent guilt,</v>

3381
02:31:23.080 --> 02:31:25.440
<v Speaker 2>like getting away with Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the problem.</v>

3382
02:31:26.090 --> 02:31:26.923
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like you liked one of the things </v>

3383
02:31:28.501 --> 02:31:29.334
<v Speaker 2>about married sex as opposed to single </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex is like if you're just dating </v>

3384
02:31:33.811 --> 02:31:34.644
<v Speaker 2>someone you don't know whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to hook up like you don't </v>

3385
02:31:38.641 --> 02:31:40.260
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>

3386
02:31:40.280 --> 02:31:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to come back to my place </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3387
02:31:43.050 --> 02:31:45.210
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the moments I remember.</v>

3388
02:31:45.211 --> 02:31:47.730
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I single time and I remember the sex,</v>

3389
02:31:47.731 --> 02:31:52.680
<v Speaker 2>but I also remember the moment where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it out there and you were like,</v>

3390
02:31:53.250 --> 02:31:57.150
<v Speaker 2>you want to get out of here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or like some sort of the early days,</v>

3391
02:31:57.180 --> 02:31:58.530
<v Speaker 2>let's go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3392
02:31:58.531 --> 02:32:00.990
<v Speaker 2>my is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go get room service or whatever it</v>

3393
02:32:00.991 --> 02:32:01.824
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>

3394
02:32:02.100 --> 02:32:04.410
<v Speaker 2>Or when a girl says that to you out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

3395
02:32:04.411 --> 02:32:05.244
<v Speaker 2>I'm horny.</v>

3396
02:32:05.970 --> 02:32:10.290
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember one time I was in Montreal at</v>

3397
02:32:10.291 --> 02:32:11.124
<v Speaker 2>the festival so I must've just gotten </v>
<v Speaker 2>off stage because I just so confident </v>

3398
02:32:13.891 --> 02:32:16.080
<v Speaker 2>and felt great and there was this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful girl.</v>

3399
02:32:16.410 --> 02:32:18.120
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to hook up with it and she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3400
02:32:18.121 --> 02:32:19.200
<v Speaker 2>you want to get a drink?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3401
02:32:19.201 --> 02:32:19.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go.</v>

3402
02:32:19.860 --> 02:32:23.220
<v Speaker 2>Let's get into the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just immediately get crazy.</v>

3403
02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:24.360
<v Speaker 2>Totally work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no drinks,</v>

3404
02:32:25.500 --> 02:32:30.500
<v Speaker 2>drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's some people do and some people like</v>

3405
02:32:31.201 --> 02:32:32.820
<v Speaker 2>sex with some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3406
02:32:33.090 --> 02:32:33.923
<v Speaker 2>But there's other people that you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have said that too and they've been </v>

3407
02:32:35.830 --> 02:32:36.760
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3408
02:32:36.810 --> 02:32:37.830
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3409
02:32:37.831 --> 02:32:40.980
<v Speaker 2>there's some people that would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Afterwards we laughed about like,</v>

3410
02:32:41.190 --> 02:32:43.180
<v Speaker 2>who were you as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know anymore,</v>

3411
02:32:43.360 --> 02:32:44.193
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as I came I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who that guy was that got </v>

3412
02:32:46.471 --> 02:32:49.110
<v Speaker 2>you to try on these sweatpants.</v>

3413
02:32:50.340 --> 02:32:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that funny,</v>

3414
02:32:51.271 --> 02:32:54.090
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difference in the way the mind works</v>

3415
02:32:54.091 --> 02:32:54.924
<v Speaker 2>when the cloud of confusion is lifted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why I'm interested in like </v>

3416
02:32:58.230 --> 02:33:00.600
<v Speaker 2>werewolves and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stories are so compelling.</v>

3417
02:33:00.601 --> 02:33:01.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3418
02:33:01.621 --> 02:33:06.480
<v Speaker 2>because sex makes so much sense when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes sense.</v>

3419
02:33:06.940 --> 02:33:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Then there's other times every comedian </v>
<v Speaker 2>writes the sexist,</v>

3420
02:33:09.841 --> 02:33:11.010
<v Speaker 2>stupid bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like every,</v>

3421
02:33:11.250 --> 02:33:14.310
<v Speaker 2>every comedian that I watched coming up </v>
<v Speaker 2>at some point we'll have the like,</v>

3422
02:33:14.820 --> 02:33:15.653
<v Speaker 2>what's that all about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put your Dick in the EU because it </v>

3423
02:33:18.391 --> 02:33:22.020
<v Speaker 2>is stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something like a transformation of a</v>

3424
02:33:22.021 --> 02:33:24.570
<v Speaker 2>werewolf happens and for some reason you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't even eat.</v>

3425
02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:26.190
<v Speaker 2>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to fuck.</v>

3426
02:33:26.191 --> 02:33:27.024
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost violating something takes </v>

3427
02:33:28.981 --> 02:33:30.840
<v Speaker 2>over and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta fuck,</v>

3428
02:33:30.841 --> 02:33:32.220
<v Speaker 2>I got to see tents now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3429
02:33:32.221 --> 02:33:35.640
<v Speaker 2>it's clearly DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's clearly the need to procreate,</v>

3430
02:33:35.670 --> 02:33:37.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a biological trick.</v>

3431
02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:40.710
<v Speaker 2>What a betrayal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The urgency of trying to create,</v>

3432
02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:45.800
<v Speaker 2>trying to read a book and it's like ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also enjoyable.</v>

3433
02:33:45.930 --> 02:33:48.540
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you got to revel in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoyable aspects of it.</v>

3434
02:33:48.541 --> 02:33:48.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3435
02:33:48.910 --> 02:33:49.743
<v Speaker 2>if procreation was just simply this like</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird sort of pragmatic choice that you </v>

3436
02:33:54.661 --> 02:33:56.370
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we're running out of people.</v>

3437
02:33:56.371 --> 02:33:57.660
<v Speaker 2>We definitely have to procreate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

3438
02:33:57.661 --> 02:34:00.120
<v Speaker 2>let's plan accordingly and set up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nursery.</v>

3439
02:34:00.121 --> 02:34:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what are we going to do?</v>

3440
02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:04.230
<v Speaker 2>It's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fun game to be stuck in the game.</v>

3441
02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:05.153
<v Speaker 2>I remember that when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was single and I would hit on </v>

3442
02:34:06.811 --> 02:34:07.644
<v Speaker 2>people or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would sometimes have to remind myself </v>

3443
02:34:09.601 --> 02:34:10.860
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you love sex,</v>

3444
02:34:10.890 --> 02:34:12.810
<v Speaker 2>like I would have to [inaudible] you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going out and you're like,</v>

3445
02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:15.460
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to go out and talk to the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'd be like,</v>

3446
02:34:15.810 --> 02:34:18.100
<v Speaker 2>like I could hear my being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust</v>

3447
02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:20.200
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this for us.</v>

3448
02:34:21.470 --> 02:34:22.303
<v Speaker 1>To really be happy once when it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually happening and then I'd be in </v>

3449
02:34:25.061 --> 02:34:27.370
<v Speaker 1>the bathroom like he was right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3450
02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3451
02:34:29.261 --> 02:34:30.094
<v Speaker 1>But which is the saddest thing when </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships deteriorate to that sort </v>

3452
02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:35.670
<v Speaker 1>of maintenance sex place where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like that.</v>

3453
02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:36.513
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a buddy of mine just got divorced </v>

3454
02:34:38.170 --> 02:34:39.780
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about,</v>

3455
02:34:39.790 --> 02:34:40.271
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

3456
02:34:40.271 --> 02:34:45.010
<v Speaker 1>we got to this point where it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like maintenance x date night,</v>

3457
02:34:45.110 --> 02:34:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I guess we should do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was just interested because there</v>

3458
02:34:48.701 --> 02:34:49.534
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard people that swear by that </v>

3459
02:34:52.451 --> 02:34:53.284
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's completely </v>

3460
02:34:54.670 --> 02:34:56.590
<v Speaker 1>dispassionate and it's not romantic at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

3461
02:34:56.860 --> 02:34:58.510
<v Speaker 1>but they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to keep fucking.</v>

3462
02:34:58.570 --> 02:35:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Even if it does seem routine because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps you connected.</v>

3463
02:35:01.870 --> 02:35:02.703
<v Speaker 1>Like spirituality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it out of the way when you're </v>

3464
02:35:04.601 --> 02:35:04.960
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>

3465
02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:05.793
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew a guy who was about to get </v>

3466
02:35:06.251 --> 02:35:07.900
<v Speaker 1>divorced and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>

3467
02:35:07.901 --> 02:35:08.734
<v Speaker 1>we just need to have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know we don't really like each </v>

3468
02:35:11.081 --> 02:35:12.730
<v Speaker 1>other right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just let,</v>

3469
02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:15.040
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do it to see if it.</v>

3470
02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:16.173
<v Speaker 1>Because you have sex with somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have sex with somebody that I </v>

3471
02:35:18.191 --> 02:35:20.010
<v Speaker 1>had just met and after you have sex you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

3472
02:35:20.050 --> 02:35:21.400
<v Speaker 1>you just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3473
02:35:21.420 --> 02:35:23.890
<v Speaker 1>woke to the potential of how great they </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be.</v>

3474
02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:24.753
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just like,</v>

3475
02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:26.590
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel so close.</v>

3476
02:35:26.620 --> 02:35:27.453
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely some strange and it </v>

3477
02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:32.770
<v Speaker 1>was a communication through sensuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3478
02:35:33.170 --> 02:35:34.003
<v Speaker 1>This is like touching and kissing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>licking and fun and just all that stuff </v>

3479
02:35:37.511 --> 02:35:38.344
<v Speaker 1>like con contributes to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your appreciation of the person you're </v>

3480
02:35:42.460 --> 02:35:43.293
<v Speaker 1>bonding and some strange way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why people get so angry when </v>

3481
02:35:45.940 --> 02:35:50.080
<v Speaker 1>you break up because it's like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking away like a piece of them,</v>

3482
02:35:50.081 --> 02:35:52.930
<v Speaker 1>like they've invested in you and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>like their,</v>

3483
02:35:52.931 --> 02:35:55.480
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their roots of like connected to you.</v>

3484
02:35:55.550 --> 02:35:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen vanilla sky?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that movie?</v>

3485
02:35:57.460 --> 02:36:01.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some time ago is driving a car and she's</v>

3486
02:36:01.661 --> 02:36:03.580
<v Speaker 1>breaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Cruise is breaking up with her,</v>

3487
02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:05.320
<v Speaker 1>so real nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She starts driving really,</v>

3488
02:36:05.321 --> 02:36:07.390
<v Speaker 1>really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ended up crashing into off a bridge</v>

3489
02:36:07.900 --> 02:36:09.550
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I asked to wear that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mask,</v>

3490
02:36:09.551 --> 02:36:10.540
<v Speaker 1>the whole moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

3491
02:36:10.930 --> 02:36:13.660
<v Speaker 1>so she's mad at him for breaking up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>her and she goes,</v>

3492
02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:16.420
<v Speaker 1>it's such as the perfect horror movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

3493
02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:18.160
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swallowed.</v>

3494
02:36:18.161 --> 02:36:18.994
<v Speaker 1>You come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just film version of exactly </v>

3495
02:36:23.051 --> 02:36:25.090
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a bond.</v>

3496
02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:25.953
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's casual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on where it's </v>

3497
02:36:28.451 --> 02:36:28.961
<v Speaker 1>Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3498
02:36:28.961 --> 02:36:32.410
<v Speaker 1>fuck you man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that magical place together,</v>

3499
02:36:32.411 --> 02:36:33.430
<v Speaker 1>you're going to act like that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

3500
02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:35.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't think sex is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had casual sex.</v>

3501
02:36:35.741 --> 02:36:38.290
<v Speaker 1>I've enjoyed casual sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people should have casual sex,</v>

3502
02:36:38.650 --> 02:36:41.590
<v Speaker 1>but their Qa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe people when they're like,</v>

3503
02:36:41.650 --> 02:36:44.350
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that meant more to me than it did to you</v>

3504
02:36:44.380 --> 02:36:45.250
<v Speaker 1>male or female.</v>

3505
02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:46.233
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also this thing where people </v>

3506
02:36:47.081 --> 02:36:50.500
<v Speaker 1>were rejected where it hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hurts really bad.</v>

3507
02:36:50.501 --> 02:36:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Like being rejected her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the things that,</v>

3508
02:36:52.991 --> 02:36:56.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I had this friend and uh,</v>

3509
02:36:56.070 --> 02:36:56.903
<v Speaker 1>I was stopped being friends with him </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he would get real upset when </v>

3510
02:36:59.591 --> 02:37:02.200
<v Speaker 1>women would turn them down and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3511
02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:03.063
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was hurting him because he wasn't an </v>

3512
02:37:04.571 --> 02:37:07.690
<v Speaker 1>attractive guy and he was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>awkward and he would try to hit on girls</v>

3513
02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:12.520
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't working and when it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>working he would get angry and I saw him</v>

3514
02:37:12.521 --> 02:37:13.354
<v Speaker 1>deteriorate psychologically over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>years because like he didn't have a </v>

3515
02:37:15.951 --> 02:37:16.220
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>

3516
02:37:16.220 --> 02:37:18.170
<v Speaker 3>he had one girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she fucked around,</v>

3517
02:37:18.180 --> 02:37:20.060
<v Speaker 3>Ahm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he just didn't.</v>

3518
02:37:20.300 --> 02:37:23.960
<v Speaker 3>He just dated for awhile and then he </v>
<v Speaker 3>became more and more bitter.</v>

3519
02:37:23.961 --> 02:37:24.794
<v Speaker 3>And what was going on was this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was associating women with rejection </v>

3520
02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:29.953
<v Speaker 3>and with that bad feeling of just being </v>
<v Speaker 3>turned down and despised like you that </v>

3521
02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:37.873
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3522
02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:41.510
<v Speaker 3>that devastating feelings to him was his</v>
<v Speaker 3>connection with women.</v>

3523
02:37:41.660 --> 02:37:42.493
<v Speaker 3>I think this is why we see a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>degradation and straight up aggression </v>

3524
02:37:46.191 --> 02:37:50.600
<v Speaker 3>in pornography for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mad At holding women.</v>

3525
02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:54.530
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of the grownup version of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>mother's tit going dry.</v>

3526
02:37:54.531 --> 02:37:56.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even trying to be frank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying.</v>

3527
02:37:56.360 --> 02:37:58.580
<v Speaker 3>Colicky baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was single,</v>

3528
02:37:58.581 --> 02:38:01.760
<v Speaker 3>I remember very vividly because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>scared the hell out of me to be honest.</v>

3529
02:38:01.761 --> 02:38:04.400
<v Speaker 3>And this is kind of vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you gotta have good audience.</v>

3530
02:38:04.930 --> 02:38:06.540
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was,</v>

3531
02:38:06.590 --> 02:38:08.240
<v Speaker 3>I was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was weird.</v>

3532
02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:10.640
<v Speaker 3>I was with two girls and I was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make that happen and it didn't.</v>

3533
02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:15.620
<v Speaker 3>And I got in the elevator and I felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a colicky baby,</v>

3534
02:38:15.621 --> 02:38:18.700
<v Speaker 3>like a teething baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do anything right.</v>

3535
02:38:19.130 --> 02:38:22.190
<v Speaker 3>But if I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't have the self restraint,</v>

3536
02:38:22.191 --> 02:38:23.150
<v Speaker 3>I would've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would've been like,</v>

3537
02:38:23.151 --> 02:38:25.640
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like,</v>

3538
02:38:25.970 --> 02:38:28.080
<v Speaker 3>how can you not pick me up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3539
02:38:28.090 --> 02:38:29.100
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put all this.</v>

3540
02:38:29.270 --> 02:38:33.680
<v Speaker 3>You feel like it's owed you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like getting all those drinks.</v>

3541
02:38:33.681 --> 02:38:34.514
<v Speaker 3>And I was so charming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you feel like a kid that got yanked </v>

3542
02:38:38.060 --> 02:38:39.020
<v Speaker 3>from love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3543
02:38:39.021 --> 02:38:40.970
<v Speaker 3>there's also the thing that we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>

3544
02:38:40.971 --> 02:38:45.380
<v Speaker 3>like when the Werewolf kicks in and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to fuck so bad and you know,</v>

3545
02:38:45.381 --> 02:38:46.214
<v Speaker 3>that it could possibly happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's this moment where you're </v>

3546
02:38:48.341 --> 02:38:49.174
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to where we'll get to come out as </v>

3547
02:38:50.230 --> 02:38:52.370
<v Speaker 3>you get to come out and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3548
02:38:52.380 --> 02:38:55.760
<v Speaker 3>and also will you love the like I need </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3549
02:38:55.970 --> 02:38:58.250
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing that's happening in</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex,</v>

3550
02:38:58.251 --> 02:38:59.840
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is someone saying,</v>

3551
02:38:59.841 --> 02:39:03.110
<v Speaker 3>I see your animal side and I celebrate </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3552
02:39:03.540 --> 02:39:08.540
<v Speaker 3>That's the opposite of a nun slapping </v>
<v Speaker 3>you with how bad boyfriend they want you</v>

3553
02:39:09.141 --> 02:39:09.974
<v Speaker 3>to feel pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want you to come out and be </v>

3554
02:39:11.121 --> 02:39:12.780
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how at the moon together,</v>

3555
02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:14.490
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carnal,</v>

3556
02:39:14.590 --> 02:39:15.423
<v Speaker 3>carnal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's beautiful and you're there and </v>

3557
02:39:16.941 --> 02:39:19.790
<v Speaker 3>if you have added three way and the more</v>
<v Speaker 3>the merrier.</v>

3558
02:39:19.820 --> 02:39:20.653
<v Speaker 3>There's witnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like a notary fucking and </v>

3559
02:39:23.361 --> 02:39:25.730
<v Speaker 3>there's someone else kind like this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

3560
02:39:25.731 --> 02:39:28.640
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's healing.</v>

3561
02:39:28.940 --> 02:39:31.640
<v Speaker 3>Talk about the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I remember pornography.</v>

3562
02:39:31.641 --> 02:39:32.474
<v Speaker 3>I think guys and maybe women to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain shame associated with just the </v>

3563
02:39:37.371 --> 02:39:40.400
<v Speaker 3>functionality or like why do we love </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick Jokes?</v>

3564
02:39:40.401 --> 02:39:41.870
<v Speaker 3>We love them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kill.</v>

3565
02:39:42.050 --> 02:39:42.883
<v Speaker 3>We don't talk about it so weird that our</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole species runs off of these fucking </v>

3566
02:39:47.571 --> 02:39:51.230
<v Speaker 3>little tubes that fill with blood and </v>
<v Speaker 3>common jet out from your body,</v>

3567
02:39:51.231 --> 02:39:56.231
<v Speaker 3>like a diving board for a mouse and look</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you're watching porn,</v>

3568
02:39:56.960 --> 02:39:59.060
<v Speaker 3>girls are just like so excited.</v>

3569
02:39:59.060 --> 02:40:00.710
<v Speaker 3>So into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all an act,</v>

3570
02:40:00.711 --> 02:40:01.700
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm assuming,</v>

3571
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:02.743
<v Speaker 3>but that's why it's like I read this </v>
<v Speaker 3>book called pornified and they were </v>

3572
02:40:05.181 --> 02:40:07.430
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men have ejaculation.</v>

3573
02:40:07.431 --> 02:40:10.250
<v Speaker 3>Shame because anytime anything comes out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your body,</v>

3574
02:40:10.251 --> 02:40:11.084
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just like shit or snide and your </v>

3575
02:40:14.071 --> 02:40:15.600
<v Speaker 3>Dick Sneezes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This.</v>

3576
02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Where does this theory come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ejaculation.</v>

3577
02:40:18.031 --> 02:40:19.200
<v Speaker 3>Shame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3578
02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:20.333
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it was in the footnotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just remember that she mentioned </v>

3579
02:40:22.171 --> 02:40:23.004
<v Speaker 3>it and I was calling like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems to make sense to me and </v>

3580
02:40:24.721 --> 02:40:27.210
<v Speaker 3>that's why you have girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even trying to be funny.</v>

3581
02:40:27.211 --> 02:40:29.730
<v Speaker 3>Guzzling come drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come face comes.</v>

3582
02:40:30.180 --> 02:40:30.721
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

3583
02:40:30.721 --> 02:40:34.550
<v Speaker 3>My faith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's solving takeaway.</v>

3584
02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:36.900
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's just ejaculations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something going,</v>

3585
02:40:37.140 --> 02:40:39.540
<v Speaker 3>I know you're a wild animal and I accept</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3586
02:40:40.220 --> 02:40:41.130
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3587
02:40:41.131 --> 02:40:44.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm the opposite of grossed out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm turned on by it by what?</v>

3588
02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:46.410
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like woman.</v>

3589
02:40:46.770 --> 02:40:47.603
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it's the same if you don't </v>

3590
02:40:51.391 --> 02:40:53.010
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of a female equivalent,</v>

3591
02:40:53.011 --> 02:40:53.844
<v Speaker 3>but like if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't care that your girls under </v>

3592
02:40:55.570 --> 02:40:57.810
<v Speaker 3>her period or whatever and you love </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

3593
02:40:58.350 --> 02:41:00.180
<v Speaker 3>not in spite of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you love them through that.</v>

3594
02:41:00.181 --> 02:41:02.710
<v Speaker 3>I think that's also kind of in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ballpark of like,</v>

3595
02:41:03.150 --> 02:41:04.290
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

3596
02:41:04.510 --> 02:41:05.343
<v Speaker 3>We're stuck in these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these weird space suits that have these </v>

3597
02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:11.970
<v Speaker 3>shit comes out of here and he blood </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes out of here.</v>

3598
02:41:12.050 --> 02:41:13.230
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all alright,</v>

3599
02:41:13.470 --> 02:41:14.970
<v Speaker 3>let's dance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the end of it,</v>

3600
02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:16.313
<v Speaker 3>there's something going on somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's between your eyes or </v>

3601
02:41:18.781 --> 02:41:19.614
<v Speaker 3>somewhere where consciousness resides </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that consciousness is also trapped </v>

3602
02:41:22.831 --> 02:41:24.630
<v Speaker 3>in these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these desires and these,</v>

3603
02:41:24.900 --> 02:41:26.570
<v Speaker 3>these biological needs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3604
02:41:26.860 --> 02:41:27.693
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3605
02:41:27.810 --> 02:41:29.880
<v Speaker 3>that's where Rhonda is really helps me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where it was like,</v>

3606
02:41:29.881 --> 02:41:32.340
<v Speaker 3>you just try and watch it unfolding you.</v>

3607
02:41:32.460 --> 02:41:33.570
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the witness.</v>

3608
02:41:33.571 --> 02:41:34.404
<v Speaker 3>You know what it's like to step into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>witness and your tanks or however it is </v>

3609
02:41:36.931 --> 02:41:38.310
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I go,</v>

3610
02:41:38.311 --> 02:41:40.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm horny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really the witness going,</v>

3611
02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting the horny signal.</v>

3612
02:41:43.060 --> 02:41:44.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always thought that was my brain,</v>

3613
02:41:44.581 --> 02:41:47.590
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something watching the brain and</v>

3614
02:41:47.630 --> 02:41:48.463
<v Speaker 3>interpreting it and the more I can be in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of the yogis call it like the </v>

3615
02:41:52.261 --> 02:41:53.094
<v Speaker 3>unflattering candle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you keep your consciousness still </v>

3616
02:41:55.710 --> 02:41:56.543
<v Speaker 3>even in the middle of a heated argument </v>
