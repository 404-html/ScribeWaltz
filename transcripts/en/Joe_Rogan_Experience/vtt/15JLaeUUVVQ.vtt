00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.950

<v Speaker 4>your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the oldest one I got from you is,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's something about you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

139

<v Speaker 4>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a thing that you had to do in Florida?</v>

140
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

141
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not anymore.</v>

142
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 4>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

143
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 4>so the</v>

144
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.040
<v Speaker 2>first time we did this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time I did this podcast with </v>

145
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.281
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these two editors in this place called </v>

146
00:06:06.281 --> 00:06:06.281
<v Speaker 2>big boss isn't here the production </v>
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>

147
00:06:06.281 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 2>We're listening to it and you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should do a show,</v>

148
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.030
<v Speaker 2>you should write a book called exit </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategies because all the crazy shit </v>

149
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 2>that happens on stage to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and I.</v>

150
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 2>and because of that I've just welcomed </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and it's gotten even fucking crazier.</v>

151
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.450
<v Speaker 2>Like the Thursday night on stage I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>three black guys onstage and we were </v>

152
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.651
<v Speaker 2>trying to write a racist white joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a joke that would hurt white </v>

153
00:06:26.651 --> 00:06:28.220
<v Speaker 2>people's feelings because I've never </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard one and I've never heard a joke.</v>

154
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you call a white guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing in front of a judge?</v>

155
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 2>The lawyer I guess like there's no like </v>
<v Speaker 2>great racist joke.</v>

156
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 2>So we were trying to write one and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys.</v>

157
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.610
<v Speaker 2>And I came to the opinion that only </v>
<v Speaker 2>white couples have a hard time getting </v>

158
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 2>pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the big,</v>

159
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 2>that's our tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you never hear like,</v>

160
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:45.970
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>licorice and right.</v>

161
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Were having a hard time conceiving so he</v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

162
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:52.370
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know.</v>

163
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:55.010
<v Speaker 2>One black couple has ever had a hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>time because even so we tried to write a</v>

164
00:06:55.011 --> 00:07:00.011
<v Speaker 2>hurtful white joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we just couldn't find the right </v>

165
00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:00.011
<v Speaker 2>rhythm anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all these women who have already done</v>

166
00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:00.011
<v Speaker 2>it by now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

167
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.400
<v Speaker 2>The closest we could find were Polish </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes.</v>

168
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:02.600
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

169
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Polish jokes are effective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to be Polish.</v>

170
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 2>That's gonna suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're the one race,</v>

171
00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:09.890
<v Speaker 2>that's automatically considered to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a knucklehead race.</v>

172
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How rude.</v>

173
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how the Polish people got that </v>

174
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.221
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was probably because they were </v>

175
00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:18.221
<v Speaker 2>illegal immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

176
00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:18.221
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it was doing.</v>

177
00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:19.700
<v Speaker 2>The Germans rolled through Poland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Polish,</v>

178
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.730
<v Speaker 2>we're really proud and they brought in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tanks and the police came up and </v>

179
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.190
<v Speaker 2>started hitting the tanks with sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Germans are like,</v>

180
00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:28.230
<v Speaker 2>are you fucking kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just and killed.</v>

181
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.630
<v Speaker 2>We just killed them off and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

182
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.100
<v Speaker 2>these guys are fucking fighting with </v>
<v Speaker 2>sticks.</v>

183
00:07:31.101 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 2>But they were proud they were defending </v>
<v Speaker 2>their country.</v>

184
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 2>So then that started the rolling of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Polish jokes.</v>

185
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Even put ski came along in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's uh,</v>

186
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't put.</v>

187
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:43.760

<v Speaker 2>wrestler.</v>

188
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Polish power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't put ski.</v>

189
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.930
<v Speaker 2>It was a little short guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was fucking super yolked.</v>

190
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

191
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Polish power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't put ski.</v>

192
00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a tank.</v>

193
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:53.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

194
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

195
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember this.</v>

196
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:55.490
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

197
00:07:55.491 --> 00:08:00.491
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how Polish no racist joke for </v>

198
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:01.360
<v Speaker 2>wiping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

199
00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

200
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.490
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we were doing on stage </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we end up doing a shot of </v>

201
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.491
<v Speaker 2>Tequila and then we're all,</v>

<v Speaker 2>positive happening in your life and like</v>

235
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 2>a week that you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally dying,</v>

236
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to die in St Louis.</v>

237
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to die before that happens.</v>

238
00:09:23.741 --> 00:09:25.230
<v Speaker 2>I'll never get to see the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it was so cool.</v>

239
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.120
<v Speaker 2>I was so excited for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

240
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what exactly did they do?</v>

241
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.110
<v Speaker 2>The A to 60.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to come rob me,</v>

242
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 2>but to 60.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't give out your address.</v>

243
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Flat screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three d TV's a keg rater,</v>

244
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:42.180
<v Speaker 2>a wine refrigerator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand cigar humidor.</v>

245
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.920
<v Speaker 2>All 200 year old reclaimed lumber on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside from a barn in Indiana.</v>

246
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.250
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

247
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 2>a desk in there as a back of a corvette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of cheesy,</v>

248
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:53.820
<v Speaker 2>but it looks cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

249
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they fucking polished.</v>

250
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they sealed up the one part,</v>

251
00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:01.500
<v Speaker 2>the old entrance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a door and they open up a wall to</v>

252
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:06.501
<v Speaker 2>the backyard and put in these humongous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fucking open like French doors.</v>

253
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.780
<v Speaker 2>10 foot French doors that open up to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>backyard,</v>

254
00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 2>put fill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole backyard was 1700 square feet </v>

255
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 2>of pavers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gave me a fire pit.</v>

256
00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're just supposed to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>man cave.</v>

257
00:10:16.681 --> 00:10:21.681
<v Speaker 2>And they were like and Tony's Goossen </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Jason and I got along and they're </v>

258
00:10:21.681 --> 00:10:21.681
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

259
00:10:21.681 --> 00:10:21.750
<v Speaker 2>Let's call out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a hundred grand.</v>

260
00:10:21.751 --> 00:10:22.800
<v Speaker 2>They dropped on this fucking mannequin.</v>

261
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.110
<v Speaker 3>It makes my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you see me,</v>

262
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.320
<v Speaker 3>like when you see me naked,</v>

263
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.510
<v Speaker 2>I've outgrown my Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my Dick.</v>

264
00:10:31.511 --> 00:10:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Smaller than my waist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More.</v>

265
00:10:32.771 --> 00:10:34.930
<v Speaker 2>They should be all my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what my house looks like compared</v>

266
00:10:34.931 --> 00:10:37.600
<v Speaker 2>to my man cave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A big guy with a little tiny dick.</v>

267
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.610
<v Speaker 2>It's wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking awesome.</v>

268
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Just increased the value of your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably we won't be able to for that </v>

269
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.740
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

270
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:51.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the best thing that we only </v>

271
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.050
<v Speaker 2>hang out with Medicaid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to go inside anymore.</v>

272
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to pay more taxes when your </v>
<v Speaker 2>house is worth more?</v>

273
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Even if you already own it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

274
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.910
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they told us.</v>

275
00:10:54.911 --> 00:10:56.620
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that true?</v>

276
00:10:56.621 --> 00:10:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Is that like people are people at old </v>
<v Speaker 2>houses?</v>

277
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I thought as if he's getting it </v>
<v Speaker 2>appraised or if he sold it.</v>

278
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.980
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know if it will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just added to it.</v>

279
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.710
<v Speaker 3>Finances were exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men Boys,</v>

283
00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:32.780
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

287
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.130

<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>

288
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.730
<v Speaker 3>maybe it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm highest fucking shit right now.</v>

289
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:40.650
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

290
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:45.710
<v Speaker 2>We did a podcast this morning with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>grower and he was with a grower.</v>

291
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's do some dangerous characters.</v>

292
00:11:48.521 --> 00:11:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Those growers to grow marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy.</v>

293
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.390
<v Speaker 2>I tried in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you?</v>

294
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up plant on my,</v>

295
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.360
<v Speaker 2>on my fire escape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was just like,</v>

296
00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.870
<v Speaker 2>I was just water it and I'll get some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sun.</v>

297
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.360
<v Speaker 2>It will be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so then growing.</v>

298
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:03.220
<v Speaker 2>It's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you got to drive the shit out.</v>

299
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.240
<v Speaker 2>Like you've got to drive much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How big did it get about the.</v>

300
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:07.880
<v Speaker 2>About the size of my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

301
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.150
<v Speaker 2>The buds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

302
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.530
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

303
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:15.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just ballpark it and just say it </v>

304
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.670
<v Speaker 2>was marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even sure what I grew up.</v>

305
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:19.120
<v Speaker 2>I definitely smoked it and I definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>grew it and I dried it and we got high,</v>

306
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.550
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't look like the kind of weed you</v>

307
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:23.230
<v Speaker 2>buy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was just shit weed.</v>

308
00:12:23.231 --> 00:12:24.610
<v Speaker 2>You fucked up really bad read.</v>

309
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Well I think it's like anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to really look into it.</v>

310
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:32.101
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a good friend who is a </v>

311
00:12:32.101 --> 00:12:32.620
<v Speaker 1>professional grower and has been forever</v>
<v Speaker 1>and went to jail time.</v>

312
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Mccormick has been on the podcast before</v>
<v Speaker 1>todd's been.</v>

313
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.020
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a legit grower though.</v>

314
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he grows for,</v>

315
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Spencer's.</v>

316
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.030
<v Speaker 2>It's so difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

317
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like I felt you just plant a seed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta Let.</v>

318
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.180
<v Speaker 2>Well you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it does.</v>

319
00:12:48.181 --> 00:12:49.440
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is wild.</v>

320
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it can grow on its own.</v>

321
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they would.</v>

322
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.140
<v Speaker 2>This was when I was working at Barnes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and noble when we grew it,</v>

323
00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:56.730
<v Speaker 2>so I brought up with good on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>basement,</v>

324
00:12:56.731 --> 00:13:00.690
<v Speaker 2>read books on marijuana growing and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to like put it in,</v>

325
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:06.140
<v Speaker 2>you have to put it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a moist towelettes in the </v>

326
00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.641
<v Speaker 2>refrigerator and let the stems like let </v>
<v Speaker 2>us start seeding and then plant it like </v>

327
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.440
<v Speaker 2>you can't just bury it.</v>

328
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people throwing the fucking weed</v>

329
00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:19.951
<v Speaker 1>out the window when they were being </v>
<v Speaker 1>chased by cops and the grows because of </v>

330
00:13:19.951 --> 00:13:19.960
<v Speaker 1>the seeds take into the side of the road</v>

331
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:25.070
<v Speaker 2>grows if there's definitely a pop liquid</v>
<v Speaker 2>or my parents stopped because there are </v>

332
00:13:25.741 --> 00:13:27.810
<v Speaker 2>tons of seeds under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are so many factors.</v>

333
00:13:27.811 --> 00:13:29.880
<v Speaker 2>You have to have parasites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got parasites.</v>

334
00:13:29.881 --> 00:13:33.540
<v Speaker 2>It's like little little bugs one time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just killed our whole crop.</v>

335
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.750
<v Speaker 2>Something in our house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

336
00:13:35.751 --> 00:13:37.590
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of shit you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>worry about growing,</v>

337
00:13:37.591 --> 00:13:40.420
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that also then you have the miracle bugs</v>

338
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:40.830
<v Speaker 2>that just.</v>

339
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like in this,</v>

340
00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:47.090
<v Speaker 1>in this day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the only way I would do it,</v>

341
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:52.120
<v Speaker 1>the only for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason was because like they </v>

342
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.330
<v Speaker 1>say that about mushrooms as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you grow them that you develop</v>

343
00:13:53.331 --> 00:13:58.331
<v Speaker 1>a relationship with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they connect with you because </v>

344
00:13:58.331 --> 00:14:01.541
<v Speaker 1>you're nurturing them and taking care of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and then when you actually finally </v>

345
00:14:01.541 --> 00:14:03.380
<v Speaker 1>eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you even more of a high real.</v>

346
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:04.070
<v Speaker 1>It's almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

347
00:14:04.071 --> 00:14:09.071
<v Speaker 1>because it's almost like they say like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference between going </v>

348
00:14:09.071 --> 00:14:10.790
<v Speaker 1>hunting and buying a steak at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grocery store.</v>

349
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole process that skipped </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you buy the steak at the grocery </v>

350
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.361
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you just become this sort of non </v>

351
00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:22.031
<v Speaker 1>thankful gelatinous fucking Slob who </v>
<v Speaker 1>just say you don't have to be able to </v>

352
00:14:22.701 --> 00:14:25.490
<v Speaker 1>get that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing is already provided for you.</v>

353
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Were you the person talking about eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>only like eating only like deers and </v>

354
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.560
<v Speaker 2>like running me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means so much sense.</v>

355
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.990
<v Speaker 2>I was on a plane piss drunk listening to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and I was like,</v>

356
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.720
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was my own personal theory</v>

357
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.770
<v Speaker 1>thing that things are difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch.</v>

358
00:14:40.771 --> 00:14:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I probably way better for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

359
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:47.850
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you got to be clever to catch </v>

360
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:47.850
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be clever to catch a deer.</v>

361
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:47.850
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be clever to catch a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>

362
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.260
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're really good for you.</v>

363
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.290
<v Speaker 1>There is so filled with nutrients in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

364
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.480
<v Speaker 1>They know that that's why they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>running like crazy.</v>

365
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.780
<v Speaker 1>The reason why they're running like fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cows are just kind of wandering in </v>

366
00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.660
<v Speaker 1>excuse cows or retards and are supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take them out and you know,</v>

367
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 1>deer are two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just faster.</v>

368
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.560
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if that that's suppose to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge because you're not supposed to</v>

369
00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:07.550
<v Speaker 2>eat it though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like a.</v>

370
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.860
<v Speaker 2>like a snake has crazy colors and it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>warn you off.</v>

371
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.040
<v Speaker 2>If it had thumbs you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be eating you.</v>

372
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.630
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to realize.</v>

373
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.900
<v Speaker 2>I've had snake snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet to make red rattlesnake </v>

374
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:19.900
<v Speaker 2>rattlesnake every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had.</v>

375
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.880
<v Speaker 2>I had one when we did the extra we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a smorgasbord of,</v>

376
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.410
<v Speaker 2>of crazy animals like lion and tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was just fucking.</v>

377
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see</v>

378
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.130
<v Speaker 1>growing your own shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

379
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:36.190
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something to that </v>

380
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:36.190
<v Speaker 1>because if you talk to a guy that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

381
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:41.010
<v Speaker 1>like that's gone hunting and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to you about eating the food that </v>

382
00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.501
<v Speaker 1>you caught yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a fucking rattlesnake or </v>

383
00:15:44.501 --> 00:15:44.750
<v Speaker 1>this whole shows on it about where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

384
00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:49.751
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people go and sustain themselves </v>

385
00:15:49.751 --> 00:15:49.751
<v Speaker 1>off the land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was that guy that was on your</v>

386
00:15:49.751 --> 00:15:50.460
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Those are those ones that bite people </v>

402
00:16:31.451 --> 00:16:31.451
<v Speaker 1>don't like the size of a great Dane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the body of a pit,</v>

403
00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.600
<v Speaker 1>huge pit bulls is what they are and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>use them for hunting bores.</v>

404
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:40.810
<v Speaker 1>They hold onto the board and then this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy comes along on fucking the travel </v>

405
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.650
<v Speaker 1>channel and stabs him to death with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>knife.</v>

406
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.480
<v Speaker 1>That's how they killed the bore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They grab it and then you come along and</v>

407
00:16:47.481 --> 00:16:51.380
<v Speaker 1>slice it's fucking throat right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is down and gritty.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I watched that show and I was like,</v>

412
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:06.160

<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

442
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:20.500

<v Speaker 2>you got your hand in a hole and you're </v>

443
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.940
<v Speaker 2>and you're underwater and you're waving </v>
<v Speaker 2>your arm and back in a hole and you can </v>

444
00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.851
<v Speaker 2>hear the thump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It thumps when it starts rolling and </v>

445
00:18:25.851 --> 00:18:27.180
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can hear it under water,</v>

446
00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:29.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it took fucking 50 pound catfish</v>

447
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.980
<v Speaker 2>and then all of a sudden he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't feel to nibble.</v>

448
00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:32.610
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I pull a 50 pound kapish out of a 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>pound hole.</v>

451
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like pulling a kindergarten round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole just like,</v>

452
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:45.080
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's massive.</v>

453
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.620
<v Speaker 2>And then I panicked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just dropped it.</v>

454
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:47.110
<v Speaker 2>I go get him.</v>

455
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Then they started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

456
00:18:50.221 --> 00:18:52.230
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get up on it.</v>

457
00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:53.660
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no fucking idea to get.</v>

458
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So did you still have it?</v>

459
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.350
<v Speaker 2>It was flipping around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

460
00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.910
<v Speaker 2>there were three girls there because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

461
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.970
<v Speaker 2>the whole pitch was that they do it with</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls and the girls definitely do it.</v>

462
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.000
<v Speaker 2>The girls definitely catch catfish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the dudes like set it up,</v>

463
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.640
<v Speaker 2>you can totally tell the dudes are </v>
<v Speaker 2>setting it up and uh,</v>

464
00:19:08.641 --> 00:19:10.530
<v Speaker 2>and then the catfish whereby a boat </v>
<v Speaker 2>dock,</v>

465
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.800
<v Speaker 2>a ramp where a boat goes in and so the </v>
<v Speaker 2>catfish,</v>

466
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:18.890
<v Speaker 2>I throw it and it became a boise and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>went over to the dock and he started </v>

467
00:19:19.111 --> 00:19:21.030
<v Speaker 2>swimming up the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ramp up the boat ramp.</v>

468
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.980
<v Speaker 2>So I just run and just jumped all over </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

469
00:19:22.981 --> 00:19:27.981
<v Speaker 2>A fumble lands on the catfish and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like all my body weight grabbed it.</v>

470
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.790
<v Speaker 2>And then a lot of them have spines to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>really careful.</v>

471
00:19:32.791 --> 00:19:34.840
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had thought that whole thing </v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

474
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.560
<v Speaker 2>And I've been stabbed by campus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you see their spines,</v>

475

<v Speaker 2>I used to fish a lot when I was a kid.</v>

476
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Really uncertain cat fish when you catch</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

477

<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to the other redneck.</v>

486
00:20:04.051 --> 00:20:05.010
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:20.190
<v Speaker 2>I just pulled a fucking mom away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>her kids and I started thinking like,</v>

495
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:25.470
<v Speaker 2>like what if someone just lifted my wife</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from my children and they were just</v>

<v Speaker 2>sitting in a hole going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does anyone know how to make a grilled </v>

<v Speaker 2>So then so then I get down,</v>

499
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.720
<v Speaker 2>I get down on the thing and I were </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to run water through it skills.</v>

500
00:20:36.721 --> 00:20:41.721
<v Speaker 2>I'm just pushing it back and forth like </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking just so that's how you keep </v>

501
00:20:41.721 --> 00:20:41.721

<v Speaker 2>keep it alive,</v>

502
00:20:41.721 --> 00:20:43.320
<v Speaker 2>and then I just let it go and he just </v>
<v Speaker 2>went and he goes,</v>

503
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.550
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck did you do?</v>

504
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.350
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she got away.</v>

505
00:20:46.351 --> 00:20:47.950
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mean for it to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

506
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

508
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:51.490

<v Speaker 2>I can't let that happen.</v>

509
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm jumping off a fucking God damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>bridge.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Extra catfish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went back there and ate dollars.</v>

511
00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Kids so stressed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ended up catching for the entire </v>

512
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.020
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ended up back there.</v>

517
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.240
<v Speaker 2>that guy and then I guarantee you that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>take that back.</v>

518
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.610
<v Speaker 2>There is a fucking show.</v>

<v Speaker 5>chasing after him.</v>

545
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.830
<v Speaker 5>So they're constantly breeding and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're smart as fuck.</v>

546
00:22:26.831 --> 00:22:30.760
<v Speaker 5>And they hide from people and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>destroy entire farms.</v>

547
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.880
<v Speaker 5>They just fuck up crops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just come in and there's not shit </v>

548
00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.910

<v Speaker 5>There's no bag limit on them because at </v>
<v Speaker 5>this point they are literally an </v>

<v Speaker 5>You don't know what that's like.</v>

587
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:10.620
<v Speaker 5>Do you come home and one of your female </v>
<v Speaker 5>pitts has killed the other female pit or</v>

<v Speaker 5>And I got to clean up the blood.</v>

589
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:15.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.600
<v Speaker 5>he's not a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The those animals or they look cool </v>

591
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.890
<v Speaker 5>because you and I are both 15 year old </v>
<v Speaker 5>boys at heart,</v>

592
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.180
<v Speaker 5>so like fucking look at that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>animal on that.</v>

593
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.120
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to have that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>me all the time because I say this shit.</v>

595
00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.870
<v Speaker 5>I see this as a guy owned pits for 10 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

596
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:36.200
<v Speaker 5>I still love pits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they're amazing dogs.</v>

597
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.410
<v Speaker 5>They're so fucking intelligent because </v>
<v Speaker 5>the cruel nature of dog fighting.</v>

598
00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.820
<v Speaker 5>Because the way it's set up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they only allowed the purest of the </v>

599
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.200
<v Speaker 5>bloodline to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They kill off the ones that quit to kill</v>

600
00:24:48.201 --> 00:24:53.201
<v Speaker 5>off the ones that don't want to fight to</v>
<v Speaker 5>kill off the ones that don't show </v>

601
00:24:53.201 --> 00:24:55.040
<v Speaker 5>absolute courage and no human </v>
<v Speaker 5>aggression.</v>

602
00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.290
<v Speaker 5>They're not supposed to ever be </v>
<v Speaker 5>aggressive to humans.</v>

603
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.560
<v Speaker 5>The only attack dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's way that way men can get in </v>

604
00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:02.840
<v Speaker 5>there and separate the dogs as they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting.</v>

605
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:08.020
<v Speaker 5>So what you develop is this super loyal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>loving wants to please you has this </v>

606
00:25:09.201 --> 00:25:13.970
<v Speaker 5>incredible drive like no other dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The driver pitbulls insane.</v>

607
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.480
<v Speaker 5>They will jump up and hold onto a tire </v>
<v Speaker 5>with their jaw for an hour.</v>

608
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:22.690
<v Speaker 5>Just hang there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their drive is so different than any </v>

609
00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:22.800
<v Speaker 5>other dog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and until you've appreciated that you,</v>

610
00:25:22.801 --> 00:25:23.780
<v Speaker 5>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't.</v>

611
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.540
<v Speaker 5>You don't know why people love those </v>
<v Speaker 5>dogs so much,</v>

612
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.400
<v Speaker 5>but they're dangerous fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're dangerous with dogs.</v>

613
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.580
<v Speaker 5>They're dangerous with little people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're dangerous with old people.</v>

614
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:39.670
<v Speaker 5>My dog did not like old people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so one of my biggest fears was that old </v>

615
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.330
<v Speaker 5>people would come by my fence and he'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

616
00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:43.430
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

617
00:25:43.431 --> 00:25:48.431
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>better back the fuck away from the </v>

618
00:25:48.431 --> 00:25:48.431
<v Speaker 5>fence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

619
00:25:48.431 --> 00:25:48.431
<v Speaker 5>I've got this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got this.</v>

620
00:25:48.431 --> 00:25:52.120
<v Speaker 5>It was like his prey drive sense that </v>
<v Speaker 5>this person was no longer a person </v>

621
00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:57.021
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was so weak and so old that his </v>

622
00:25:57.021 --> 00:25:58.430
<v Speaker 5>killer instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that's what you go after.</v>

623
00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:03.320
<v Speaker 5>That's what a killer animal goes after.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They see a weakness like hyenas.</v>

624
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:08.440
<v Speaker 5>You can raise hyenas as a pet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you show any signs of weakness,</v>

625
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:13.630
<v Speaker 5>like if you limp in front of a Hyena,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you better hope that fucking has got a </v>

626
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:16.520
<v Speaker 5>muzzle on or you better hope that things</v>
<v Speaker 5>got a muzzle on because it won't be able</v>

627
00:26:16.521 --> 00:26:18.680
<v Speaker 5>to protect it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're one people to help itself.</v>

628
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.340
<v Speaker 5>It won't be able to help itself even </v>
<v Speaker 5>though you've raised it your whole life.</v>

629
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.400
<v Speaker 5>If a hygienist sees you limping the lock</v>
<v Speaker 5>on you with those fucking crazy eyes and</v>

630
00:26:29.571 --> 00:26:34.571

<v Speaker 5>mankind in the mammal world at least,</v>

631
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.490
<v Speaker 5>and they just take a big chunk out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>your asshole.</v>

632
00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.840
<v Speaker 5>That's your pet hyena that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

633
00:26:40.841 --> 00:26:43.880
<v Speaker 5>You want this cooler,</v>

<v Speaker 5>home with me and it just eats you.</v>

731
00:30:25.801 --> 00:30:26.160
<v Speaker 7>house and it's all in its brief because </v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a Pekinese.</v>

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.560
<v Speaker 7>that's what it was bred for as an alarm </v>
<v Speaker 7>system dog.</v>

734
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this going to alarm dogs?</v>

735
00:30:30.931 --> 00:30:35.931
<v Speaker 4>Kill worker at ving?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rhames home or a 40 year old man was </v>

736
00:30:35.931 --> 00:30:40.431
<v Speaker 4>mauled to death by as many as four dogs </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the home of ving rhames before,</v>

737
00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:44.370
<v Speaker 7>before Joe's dogs went crazy and went </v>
<v Speaker 7>crazy.</v>

738
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.800
<v Speaker 7>He used to have me babysit his dogs when</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was out of town,</v>

739
00:30:46.801 --> 00:30:49.380
<v Speaker 7>so I'd bring my girlfriend at the time </v>
<v Speaker 7>and we'd go there to feed the dog.</v>

740
00:30:49.381 --> 00:30:52.440
<v Speaker 7>And one time she's like feeding the dog </v>
<v Speaker 7>and the dog like bitter in the hand.</v>

741
00:30:52.441 --> 00:30:55.290
<v Speaker 7>But it was kind of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>was that a playful bite or fight?</v>

742
00:30:55.530 --> 00:31:00.530
<v Speaker 7>But I was so scared.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Every time I would go to his house </v>

743
00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:03.381
<v Speaker 7>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can tell some dogs you just can't </v>

744

<v Speaker 4>Oprah Winfrey.</v>

780
00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.820

00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:49.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she's doing the right thing.</v>

786

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good show.</v>

788
00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.400

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:12.140
<v Speaker 1>she worked her tail off doing promotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and publicity for the show and then </v>

793
00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:16.590
<v Speaker 1>because of a technical mistake that show</v>
<v Speaker 1>aired in a completely different time and</v>

809
00:33:53.811 --> 00:33:55.610
<v Speaker 1>when did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they use to do it?</v>

810
00:33:55.611 --> 00:33:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Like where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

811
00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:57.980
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

812
00:33:57.981 --> 00:34:00.530
<v Speaker 1>the whole country aired cbs at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

813
00:34:00.531 --> 00:34:03.290
<v Speaker 1>So people had to watch lost at six PM </v>
<v Speaker 1>and La,</v>

814
00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:04.020
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

815
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:04.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

816
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:04.740
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

817
00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:08.870
<v Speaker 2>If you have direct tv then then you will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to see the premiere at 5:00.</v>

818
00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

819
00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:13.160
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is when did they </v>
<v Speaker 1>start switching it up?</v>

820
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:16.490
<v Speaker 1>When did they start having to </v>
<v Speaker 1>broadcasts?</v>

821
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.520
<v Speaker 1>I think they did that for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

822
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Did they always have to feel that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had an east coast and the west coast?</v>

823
00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.800
<v Speaker 1>I think so because after awhile they'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>

824
00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:28.640
<v Speaker 1>they probably figured out like when do </v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to watch TV?</v>

825
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.100
<v Speaker 1>They get home from work at five ish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

826
00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:31.940
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven ish.</v>

827
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Eight ish is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight to 10 inches good and then we're </v>

828
00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:37.120
<v Speaker 1>tired and we got to go to bed or you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Weirdo and you hate your life and your</v>

829
00:34:37.121 --> 00:34:39.030
<v Speaker 1>staff and you watch late night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they know</v>

830
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:42.190
<v Speaker 2>at all what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who's programming television,</v>

831
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:47.270
<v Speaker 2>it has to be demand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to switch it to no way to </v>

832
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.161
<v Speaker 2>figure out what do you like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you really think anyone saw jersey </v>

<v Speaker 1>like a retard.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fx is going to have the ultimate fighter</v>

841

<v Speaker 1>going to have some programming on,</v>

842
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.400

<v Speaker 1>And a no brainer,</v>

843
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's sorta been good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys,</v>

844
00:35:15.531 --> 00:35:20.150
<v Speaker 1>no fucking sports like when you see like</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the mines comparing notes and trying</v>

845
00:35:20.151 --> 00:35:22.100
<v Speaker 1>to figure out the best way to market </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and push things.</v>

846
00:35:22.101 --> 00:35:27.101
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a level of like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys know how to push shows.</v>

847
00:35:28.191 --> 00:35:29.330
<v Speaker 1>They know how to promote shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

848
00:35:29.331 --> 00:35:31.400
<v Speaker 1>how to make things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're right,</v>

849
00:35:31.401 --> 00:35:36.401
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that are doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't know what the fuck they're </v>

850
00:35:36.401 --> 00:35:37.830
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially executives when it comes to,</v>

851
00:35:37.831 --> 00:35:42.831
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative issues where it comes to like </v>

852
00:35:42.831 --> 00:35:46.550
<v Speaker 1>see like comedies and things along those</v>
<v Speaker 1>lines when you have editors or you have </v>

853
00:35:46.591 --> 00:35:47.150
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

854
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.440
<v Speaker 1>executives that are interjecting their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

855
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:52.560
<v Speaker 1>It almost is never good for the funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost never,</v>

856
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:56.160
<v Speaker 1>so they fucked that up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's for sports.</v>

857
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I think they know exactly what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

858
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.200
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they can affect the outcome.</v>

859
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:01.830
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

860
00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:06.930
<v Speaker 2>Course you're not going to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way for an executive to </v>

861
00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:07.400
<v Speaker 2>throws to sense into an MMA fight.</v>

862
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:09.210
<v Speaker 1>They can't help themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

863
00:36:09.211 --> 00:36:14.211
<v Speaker 1>Their ego is so fucking strong ego that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets you to the position to be a high </v>

864
00:36:14.211 --> 00:36:15.030
<v Speaker 1>level executive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Ego,</v>

865
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.190
<v Speaker 1>your shelf fucking right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so.</v>

866
00:36:17.191 --> 00:36:18.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking right.</v>

867
00:36:18.391 --> 00:36:23.391
<v Speaker 1>You know you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's so hard for them to like </v>

868
00:36:23.391 --> 00:36:26.540
<v Speaker 1>just let you make a show because until </v>

<v Speaker 1>and comedy central.</v>

870
00:36:28.961 --> 00:36:33.961
<v Speaker 1>A guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They south park probably doesn't even </v>

877
00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.940

<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

878
00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:56.100
<v Speaker 2>it's like the rumor mill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that he doesn't make a ton of money </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

905
00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:45.990
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The FCC doesn't regulate them.</v>

906
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:46.340
<v Speaker 2>We don't</v>

907
00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.850
<v Speaker 1>realize that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't realize that.</v>

908
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:52.380
<v Speaker 1>You see hpo you think that the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>why hbo has swears is because Hbo the.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Through all of cable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

913
00:37:56.041 --> 00:37:58.940
<v Speaker 1>They're just losing their belts though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These channels are loosening their belts</v>

914
00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:03.970
<v Speaker 1>and seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The realizing because the Internet that </v>

915
00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:05.950
<v Speaker 1>people have different sensibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the same people that are </v>

916
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.020
<v Speaker 1>listening to this podcast are also </v>

918
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are realizing now that </v>

919
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.420
<v Speaker 1>people's sensibilities are a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>broader.</v>

920
00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.230
<v Speaker 2>It's the advertisers is who's taking it </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from him.</v>

921
00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.630

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>on south park.</v>

939
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:04.860

<v Speaker 1>it is an American gem.</v>

943
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:17.240
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the word I'm looking for?</v>

944
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:22.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cultural treasure that shows a </v>

945
00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.190
<v Speaker 1>cultural treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch it as much as I should,</v>

946
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:25.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's fucking</v>

<v Speaker 2>brilliant of art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only know.</v>

948
00:39:28.781 --> 00:39:32.080
<v Speaker 2>I can only speak from American Justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>League or team team America,</v>

949
00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.030
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was fucking made me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My team,</v>

950
00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:37.810
<v Speaker 2>America world police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the funniest fucking thing of all time.</v>

951
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.750
<v Speaker 2>One of the funniest movies of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly what South Park is.</v>

952
00:39:40.751 --> 00:39:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never got into.</v>

953
00:39:41.801 --> 00:39:42.250
<v Speaker 2>I never got it</v>

954
00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.390
<v Speaker 1>did genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's genius.</v>

955
00:39:44.391 --> 00:39:49.040
<v Speaker 1>It's the best comedy as far as that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like silly animation type shit that's</v>

956
00:39:49.041 --> 00:39:50.900
<v Speaker 1>ever been created ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion.</v>

957
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody can fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

958
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:55.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean the simpsons obviously are </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant and there's a lot of formulas,</v>

959
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:58.740
<v Speaker 1>but there's still have the simpsons.</v>

960
00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.420
<v Speaker 2>I can't watch family guy either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

961
00:40:00.421 --> 00:40:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live alone.</v>

962
00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.340
<v Speaker 2>If you opened me up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bleeds playing the guy.</v>

963
00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:07.830
<v Speaker 1>It bothers me that South Park likes this</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit on family guy so much.</v>

964
00:40:07.831 --> 00:40:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it hurts my feelings and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>like family guy.</v>

965
00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Family guy is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

966
00:40:12.421 --> 00:40:14.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not as good as South Park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different,</v>

967
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:19.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's very short attention span.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could just sit there and just be taken</v>

968
00:40:19.051 --> 00:40:21.320
<v Speaker 1>away on this little silly journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

969
00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:22.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a good show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

970
00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Family guy is a good show.</v>

971
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:26.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen American dad either.</v>

972
00:40:26.451 --> 00:40:30.740
<v Speaker 2>I want what I like is that moment when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize the brilliance,</v>

973
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.530
<v Speaker 2>like the first time you were watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>family guy,</v>

974
00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:34.820
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's this?</v>

975
00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:38.840
<v Speaker 2>And then the joke hit and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>

976
00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:41.840
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I remember when someone was,</v>

977
00:40:41.841 --> 00:40:46.841
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that thing was someone was </v>

978
00:40:46.841 --> 00:40:47.690
<v Speaker 2>choking in the front yard and Peter ran </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and,</v>

979
00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:51.230
<v Speaker 2>and Brian and the dogs sitting there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter runs out and he goes,</v>

980
00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.480
<v Speaker 2>don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how to do this.</v>

981
00:40:53.481 --> 00:40:56.090
<v Speaker 2>I can do the Heimlich maneuver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read it in a book.</v>

982
00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:57.660
<v Speaker 2>And Brian Goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter,</v>

983
00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.020
<v Speaker 2>you sure you read it in a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you sure?</v>

984
00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:00.020
<v Speaker 2>Just wasn't nothing.</v>

985
00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:04.350
<v Speaker 3>And I heard that and I just started </v>
<v Speaker 3>laughing so fucking hard.</v>

986
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:07.640
<v Speaker 3>And this wasn't nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

987
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:10.960
<v Speaker 3>That's such a weird bug in live.</v>

988
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:17.100
<v Speaker 2>So I tried to get Leanne to my wife to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch family guy and she,</v>

989
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:19.530
<v Speaker 2>she'd sit there and watch it with me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just didn't get it.</v>

990
00:41:19.531 --> 00:41:22.590
<v Speaker 2>And then the one time where Peter fell </v>
<v Speaker 2>and skinned his knee</v>

991
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 3>for like five minutes anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden my wife just </v>

992
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 3>starts laughing hysterically and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>

993
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.560
<v Speaker 3>looks at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

994
00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.480
<v Speaker 3>how long is he going to do that for it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

995
00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.020
<v Speaker 3>that's a funny joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he's</v>

996
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:39.030
<v Speaker 2>done is brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love those moments where you fucking </v>

997
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.030
<v Speaker 2>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

998
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:43.871
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just clicks in your head and you </v>

999
00:41:43.871 --> 00:41:43.871
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1000
00:41:43.871 --> 00:41:44.420
<v Speaker 2>that's funny shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I want those all the time.</v>

1001
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1002
00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Mcfarland's a cool dude too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1003
00:41:46.531 --> 00:41:48.100
<v Speaker 1>I met him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a voice on a.</v>

1004
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I Guess I did myself on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on wasn't buried meet.</v>

1005
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they parodied me on American Dad,</v>

1006
00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:58.170
<v Speaker 1>but on family guy came in and actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>did the voice and he was so nice.</v>

1007
00:41:58.171 --> 00:42:00.360
<v Speaker 1>He was so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it like to be buried?</v>

1008
00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Parodied?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>

1009
00:42:01.561 --> 00:42:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't sound anything like me.</v>

1010
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.880
<v Speaker 1>It was like I pulled up in a car and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was drinking and I was like talking </v>

1011
00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.650
<v Speaker 1>about strippers or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I guess is how they thought of me,</v>

1012
00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:16.010
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if he had really hit home and it </v>

1013
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:18.341
<v Speaker 1>really touched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it was me last night it was </v>

1014
00:42:18.341 --> 00:42:22.431
<v Speaker 1>drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking for strippers and my </v>

1015
00:42:22.431 --> 00:42:23.250
<v Speaker 1>accent did sound anything like me </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

1016
00:42:23.251 --> 00:42:24.840
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a bad accident.</v>

1017
00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.680
<v Speaker 1>I would love it if no one's ever been </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to do an impression of me.</v>

1018
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:33.950

<v Speaker 1>there's certain guys that you can </v>

1019

<v Speaker 1>imitate their voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:24.620
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk.</v>

1041
00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:28.200
<v Speaker 1>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of my favorite human beings.</v>

1042
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:32.160
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listen to this audio.</v>

1043
00:43:32.161 --> 00:43:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm Ron Bennington's interviewing Penn </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jillette and it was so good.</v>

1044
00:43:36.241 --> 00:43:41.241
<v Speaker 1>It was such a good interview that I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>an email pen right afterwards and just </v>

1045
00:43:41.241 --> 00:43:41.241
<v Speaker 1>tell him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1046
00:43:41.241 --> 00:43:41.241
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>

1047
00:43:41.241 --> 00:43:45.780
<v Speaker 1>he is such an interesting guy and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about so many cool things.</v>

1048
00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:51.090
<v Speaker 1>It was really a fun interview man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that he said was </v>

1049
00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:53.790
<v Speaker 1>that the person who's in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you come up with something,</v>

1050
00:43:53.791 --> 00:43:58.791
<v Speaker 1>the person who's in the room when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>bouncing an idea around the person </v>

1051
00:43:58.791 --> 00:43:59.280
<v Speaker 1>you're bouncing with has an effect on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea.</v>

1052
00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:04.520
<v Speaker 1>The person you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conversation where it's like if </v>

1053
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.290
<v Speaker 1>you'd come up with the most brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea and his thing was that the people </v>

1054
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:08.010
<v Speaker 1>that are like say if you came up with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea for something,</v>

1055
00:44:08.011 --> 00:44:11.250
<v Speaker 1>the people that were in the room with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should claim half of that,</v>

1056
00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:16.310
<v Speaker 1>that that project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally because you would not have come </v>

1057
00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:19.431
<v Speaker 1>up with that project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you weren't in their presence and I'm </v>

1058
00:44:19.431 --> 00:44:19.431
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is so true.</v>

1059
00:44:19.431 --> 00:44:20.340
<v Speaker 1>And Duncan trussell's the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>example for that,</v>

1060
00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:25.640
<v Speaker 1>both with him and with me because Duncan</v>
<v Speaker 1>has always said that like he never goes </v>

1061
00:44:25.801 --> 00:44:28.740
<v Speaker 1>as deep into the rabbit hole as he does </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's on this show</v>

1062
00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:32.910
<v Speaker 2>is lavender lavender hour is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This show it's nothing.</v>

1063
00:44:32.911 --> 00:44:33.900
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1064
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:36.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot lighter.</v>

1065
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:38.850
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he's talking to you,</v>

1066
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:41.720
<v Speaker 2>you guys go into some deep shit where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>am.</v>

1067
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they'll give me panic attacks.</v>

1068
00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:48.850
<v Speaker 5>He's given me some very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 5>insight on the possibilities,</v>

1069
00:44:48.951 --> 00:44:49.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of people say,</v>

1070
00:44:49.881 --> 00:44:52.940
<v Speaker 5>well it's just fucking stupid hippie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if,</v>

1071
00:44:52.941 --> 00:44:54.270
<v Speaker 5>what if talk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1072
00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.540
<v Speaker 5>and that is a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there are,</v>

1073
00:44:56.810 --> 00:45:00.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure what this is and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>think you are either.</v>

1074
00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:05.440
<v Speaker 5>I think you can pretend that you're sure</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it makes you feel better at </v>

1075
00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.760
<v Speaker 5>night and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can pretend that everything that you</v>

1076
00:45:07.761 --> 00:45:12.761
<v Speaker 5>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't hit with a hammer isn't real </v>

1077
00:45:12.761 --> 00:45:13.590
<v Speaker 5>and it's just your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just what?</v>

1078
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.590
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck is consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man?</v>

1079
00:45:15.591 --> 00:45:17.720
<v Speaker 5>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is life?</v>

1080
00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.580
<v Speaker 5>What is this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1081
00:45:19.581 --> 00:45:24.581
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to call Bert Kreischer and </v>
<v Speaker 5>asked him to come over to my house and </v>

1082
00:45:24.581 --> 00:45:28.541
<v Speaker 5>burt somehow or another navigates his </v>
<v Speaker 5>way through space and time and arrives </v>

1083
00:45:28.541 --> 00:45:32.501
<v Speaker 5>at my doorstep and us friends get to </v>
<v Speaker 5>communicate and we're talking into some </v>

1084
00:45:32.501 --> 00:45:37.391
<v Speaker 5>fucking thing that takes all of our </v>
<v Speaker 5>voice and all the shit that we say and </v>

1085
00:45:37.641 --> 00:45:42.641
<v Speaker 5>throws it through some Internet and </v>
<v Speaker 5>breaks it down to ones and Zeros where </v>

1086
00:45:42.641 --> 00:45:45.380
<v Speaker 5>it's then interpreted by other people's </v>
<v Speaker 5>computers in real time.</v>

1087
00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:49.760
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't tell me you know what this is.</v>

1088
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.510
<v Speaker 5>This is the bizarreness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If life wasn't real,</v>

1089
00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:56.420
<v Speaker 5>it would be the craziest psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 5>trip ever.</v>

1090
00:45:56.810 --> 00:46:00.860
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like when a real psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 5>trip is something you're not used to,</v>

1091
00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.050
<v Speaker 5>something you're not just throws you </v>
<v Speaker 5>off,</v>

1092
00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:08.560
<v Speaker 5>but life itself isn't the most uber </v>
<v Speaker 5>bizarre thing ever.</v>

1093
00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:14.420
<v Speaker 2>It would seem more plausible to say you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have many lives in different </v>

1094
00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:19.071
<v Speaker 2>parallels and you could travel through </v>
<v Speaker 2>time then to say to someone that we </v>

1095
00:46:19.071 --> 00:46:21.060
<v Speaker 2>could talk to you from this room into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cave like that.</v>

1096
00:46:21.061 --> 00:46:24.840
<v Speaker 2>You can send more voices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you'd said pitched everything to</v>

1097
00:46:24.841 --> 00:46:27.210
<v Speaker 2>the cave men and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going to be more plausible?</v>

1098
00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Three guys can then talk and it'll just </v>
<v Speaker 2>travel around the country and everyone </v>

1099
00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:33.390
<v Speaker 2>can hear them talk or you just have </v>
<v Speaker 2>another life.</v>

1100
00:46:33.391 --> 00:46:33.780
<v Speaker 2>They'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1101
00:46:33.781 --> 00:46:34.750
<v Speaker 2>fuck another life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely,</v>

1102
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:36.780
<v Speaker 2>definitely one of another life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely.</v>

1103
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:40.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm deaf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I completely believe in time travel.</v>

1104
00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:41.170
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1105
00:46:41.171 --> 00:46:46.171
<v Speaker 5>they've actually shown like recently the</v>
<v Speaker 5>most recent studies say that the speed </v>

1106
00:46:46.541 --> 00:46:48.730
<v Speaker 5>of light cannot be bypassed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't,</v>

1107
00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.630
<v Speaker 5>can't surpass the speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they believe that time travel will be</v>

1108
00:46:52.631 --> 00:46:55.120
<v Speaker 5>in fact impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's just</v>

1109
00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.860
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck your dog.</v>

1110
00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:04.440
<v Speaker 3>What else do you want to buy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A dog knows whether or not they're </v>

1111
00:47:13.101 --> 00:47:18.060
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We won't find out for a long time.</v>

1112
00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:23.070
<v Speaker 3>Bird crusher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully you and I will be alive </v>

1113
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:25.781
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully if we take our vitamins and </v>

1114
00:47:25.781 --> 00:47:25.781
<v Speaker 3>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While I want to do those brain pills,</v>

1115
00:47:25.781 --> 00:47:26.840
<v Speaker 3>some guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a bottom.</v>

1116
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:28.010
<v Speaker 3>Some guy that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1117
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:28.680
<v Speaker 5>People,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1118
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 5>people think it's nuts,</v>

1119
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:35.070
<v Speaker 7>but I can tell you 100 percent that </v>
<v Speaker 7>vitamins have enhanced my,</v>

1120
00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.530
<v Speaker 7>my,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my feeling,</v>

1121
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:43.560
<v Speaker 7>the way I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the way my body feels and enhance my </v>

1122
00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.200
<v Speaker 7>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I believe they give me a call.</v>

1123
00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.770
<v Speaker 7>My body feels clear.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It feels like it's less needy.</v>

1124
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:52.950
<v Speaker 7>It feels like it's more filled.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When when your body is filled with </v>

1125
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:54.370
<v Speaker 7>nutrients and you're eating healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it works better.</v>

1126
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:59.460
<v Speaker 7>I really truly believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We know that people died of scurvy </v>

1127
00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.310
<v Speaker 7>because they didn't get enough vitamin </v>
<v Speaker 7>C,</v>

1128
00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:05.311
<v Speaker 7>we know that essential nutrients are </v>
<v Speaker 7>very important part of keeping the body </v>

1129
00:48:05.311 --> 00:48:10.141
<v Speaker 7>vibrant and healthy and when I eat well </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I've been eating really healthy </v>

1130
00:48:10.141 --> 00:48:14.311
<v Speaker 7>lately,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've been drinking this vitamix thing </v>

1131
00:48:14.311 --> 00:48:15.490
<v Speaker 7>every morning and drinking these blended</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kale milkshakes and not milkshakes.</v>

1132
00:48:15.491 --> 00:48:17.900
<v Speaker 7>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's just blended Kale and cucumbers and</v>

1133
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:22.910
<v Speaker 7>smoothies.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Smoothies and I feel really good and </v>

1134
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:24.310
<v Speaker 7>because I'm giving my body all this </v>
<v Speaker 7>healthy stuff,</v>

1135
00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.020
<v Speaker 7>it feels like it works better.</v>

1136
00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:31.200
<v Speaker 7>When I take these Alpha brain pills,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what they are is nutrients that are </v>

1137
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.300
<v Speaker 7>supposed to enhance cerebral function.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

1138
00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:36.040
<v Speaker 7>is that a fact?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Man?</v>

1139
00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:37.930
<v Speaker 7>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't fucking know and shit.</v>

1140
00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:42.980
<v Speaker 7>I can't tell you exactly what mean.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cognitive function is a very hard thing </v>

1141
00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:44.230
<v Speaker 7>to to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Unless you're testing someone,</v>

1142
00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:45.190
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what are you going to do?</v>

1143
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.070
<v Speaker 7>You're going to make them perform tasks </v>
<v Speaker 7>and then they're going to give him these</v>

1144
00:48:48.071 --> 00:48:49.930
<v Speaker 7>pills and see if they can perform the </v>
<v Speaker 7>tasks.</v>

1145
00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:54.040
<v Speaker 7>I guess it'd be you got to factor in all</v>
<v Speaker 7>sorts of other things into account.</v>

1146
00:48:54.041 --> 00:48:55.870
<v Speaker 7>How do I know that this guy isn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>stressed out?</v>

1147
00:48:55.871 --> 00:48:58.060
<v Speaker 7>How do I know that he's not tired?</v>
<v Speaker 7>How do I know that?</v>

1148
00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:00.190
<v Speaker 7>I'll take it for a month and I'll test,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you know what I'm saying.</v>

1149
00:49:00.191 --> 00:49:02.170
<v Speaker 7>I'm doing tests.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like you,</v>

1150
00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:02.660
<v Speaker 7>you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's.</v>

1151
00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.750
<v Speaker 7>There's other variables in this person's</v>
<v Speaker 7>life,</v>

1152
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:09.840
<v Speaker 7>so you'd have to do a lot of tests,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the idea behind them is very sound </v>

1153
00:49:10.061 --> 00:49:15.061
<v Speaker 7>and that idea is that nutrients can </v>
<v Speaker 7>enhance cognitive function and I think </v>

1154
00:49:15.061 --> 00:49:19.441
<v Speaker 7>they can and I think that these pills do</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I know for a fact that I am feeling </v>

1155
00:49:19.901 --> 00:49:21.070
<v Speaker 7>good during the day.</v>

1156
00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:26.070
<v Speaker 7>I feel like I have even energy and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 7>having dreams man my dreams or a stray </v>

1157
00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:32.200
<v Speaker 7>psycho with my grandparents yesterday it</v>
<v Speaker 7>felt like it was real shit.</v>

1158
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:34.450
<v Speaker 7>Do you realize their dreams in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>middle of them?</v>

1159
00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:37.810
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because I'm doing that all the time,</v>

1160
00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:39.840
<v Speaker 7>but the detail was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I,</v>

1161
00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:45.040
<v Speaker 7>I was remembering this old photo of my </v>
<v Speaker 7>grandfather I saw a long time ago and he</v>

1162
00:49:45.131 --> 00:49:47.320
<v Speaker 7>had the exact same suit on the St Pants </v>
<v Speaker 7>on.</v>

1163
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.720
<v Speaker 7>I saw this photo once at my mom's house,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but my mom,</v>

1164
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:51.700
<v Speaker 7>I was telling my mom about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She sent me the photo.</v>

1165
00:49:51.701 --> 00:49:54.160
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's exactly what I saw my grandfather</v>

1166
00:49:54.161 --> 00:49:56.760
<v Speaker 7>wearing and the dream to the exact </v>
<v Speaker 7>detail.</v>

1167
00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:58.780
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is it about remembering the dreams?</v>

1168
00:49:58.781 --> 00:50:03.781
<v Speaker 7>Because that's the most shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's two shocking things that these </v>

1169
00:50:03.781 --> 00:50:04.060
<v Speaker 7>pills have done for me is for us to </v>
<v Speaker 7>remember one,</v>

1170
00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:07.390
<v Speaker 7>remembering dreams and to being lucid in</v>
<v Speaker 7>the middle of a dream.</v>

1171
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:12.540
<v Speaker 7>I stayed in a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was in a dream and I stayed in the </v>

1172
00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:12.540
<v Speaker 7>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>

1173
00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.150
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well this is just a fucking dream,</v>

1174
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.250
<v Speaker 7>and I just.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't even go lucid,</v>

1175
00:50:15.251 --> 00:50:17.170
<v Speaker 7>like I didn't try to control it or move </v>
<v Speaker 7>around.</v>

1176
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:22.320
<v Speaker 7>I just let the dream play out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I realized it was a dream and I </v>

1177
00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:22.320
<v Speaker 7>still didn't wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have a.</v>

1178
00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.170
<v Speaker 7>that's a rare thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Pills,</v>

1179
00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:25.660
<v Speaker 7>just for that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dreams.</v>

1180
00:50:25.661 --> 00:50:28.190
<v Speaker 7>I have dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have fucking crazy</v>

1181
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.740
<v Speaker 4>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I am totally lucid inside my dreams.</v>

1182
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:33.380
<v Speaker 4>Dreams that I'm reading something and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll go.</v>

1183
00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:34.700
<v Speaker 4>I'll be to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

1184
00:50:34.701 --> 00:50:37.400
<v Speaker 4>that's so funny that I'm reading </v>
<v Speaker 4>something because nothing's there in the</v>

1185
00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:38.180
<v Speaker 4>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll think this.</v>

1186
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 4>Nothing's there in my mind is making up </v>
<v Speaker 4>these words,</v>

1187
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:42.530
<v Speaker 4>but I'm still reading them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so interesting.</v>

1188
00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:47.830
<v Speaker 4>I had a dream one time that me and Elvis</v>
<v Speaker 4>walked into his potel room and there </v>

1189
00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:47.830
<v Speaker 4>were four dudes,</v>

<v Speaker 4>created.</v>

1192
00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:58.880
<v Speaker 4>I had a dream that I was with Elvis and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we walked into his dressing room.</v>

<v Speaker 4>There was four dudes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Not that the guys were both fucking </v>

1207
00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:41.130
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That they didn't know it was the product</v>

1208
00:51:41.131 --> 00:51:43.320
<v Speaker 3>placement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck did Burger King do to</v>

1209
00:51:43.321 --> 00:51:45.500
<v Speaker 3>get it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck?</v>

1210
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:48.860
<v Speaker 3>What if they figured it out yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

1211
00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:53.860
<v Speaker 4>just don't know that there is way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>interject advertising into your dreams </v>

1212
00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:59.680
<v Speaker 4>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now it's like I got chrysler </v>

1213
00:51:59.680 --> 00:51:59.680
<v Speaker 4>stream about the Elvis and the butt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking ha ha.</v>

1214
00:51:59.680 --> 00:51:59.810
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1215
00:51:59.811 --> 00:52:00.410
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what is.</v>

1216
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:05.470
<v Speaker 4>There's a possibility that someone could</v>
<v Speaker 4>insert a product to a dream,</v>

1217
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:10.900
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They could give you a cheeseburger and </v>

1218
00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:13.220
<v Speaker 4>that cheeseburger with some experimental</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that would make you think about </v>

1219
00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:15.360
<v Speaker 4>burger king in a dream and see a burger </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a dream.</v>

1220
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:16.220
<v Speaker 4>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do it.</v>

1221
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:19.830
<v Speaker 4>It's going Geico and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1222
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:25.210
<v Speaker 4>in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't make any sense because </v>

1223
00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:25.210
<v Speaker 4>donald duck noises.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Geico.</v>

1224
00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:27.050
<v Speaker 4>You have to eat something to have this </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen to you.</v>

1225
00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:29.640
<v Speaker 4>We're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're missing the whole packet.</v>

1226
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:31.760
<v Speaker 4>We're stumbling on something very </v>
<v Speaker 4>brilliant right now.</v>

1227
00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is a possibility,</v>

1228
00:52:33.411 --> 00:52:34.310
<v Speaker 4>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1229
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.370
<v Speaker 4>100 years in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but 100 years,</v>

1230
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:42.050
<v Speaker 4>if you're drinking booze here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the rare booze pod test,</v>

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:43.940
<v Speaker 4>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these pussies,</v>

1232
00:52:43.941 --> 00:52:47.340

<v Speaker 4>I got a heineken like a man tall tomboy.</v>

1233
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:52.040
<v Speaker 4>What if you could bring your wife's </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain by talking to her while she slept?</v>

1234
00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:54.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people think that you can do that.</v>

1235
00:52:54.111 --> 00:52:59.111
<v Speaker 4>People think that you can hypnotize </v>
<v Speaker 4>people while they're sleeping and they </v>

1236
00:52:59.111 --> 00:52:59.111
<v Speaker 4>believe they can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1237
00:52:59.111 --> 00:53:02.510
<v Speaker 4>hypnosis guys believed that they can </v>
<v Speaker 4>control all sorts of behavior by putting</v>

1238
00:53:02.511 --> 00:53:07.511
<v Speaker 4>people under,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you are already under and they </v>

1239
00:53:07.511 --> 00:53:09.350
<v Speaker 4>started talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if a guy can really hypnotize you,</v>

1240
00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:14.310
<v Speaker 4>that's the book that those comics cannot</v>
<v Speaker 4>be human.</v>

1241
00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.340
<v Speaker 4>They can't do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the kids with anyone.</v>

1242
00:53:16.341 --> 00:53:16.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1243
00:53:16.761 --> 00:53:17.030
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1244
00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:18.260
<v Speaker 4>You're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're wrong.</v>

1245
00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:21.050
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent do it for Santos was</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good friend of mine.</v>

1246
00:53:21.051 --> 00:53:23.830
<v Speaker 4>He was already to hit the test in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bosch and say,</v>

1247
00:53:23.831 --> 00:53:25.740
<v Speaker 4>good friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good friend.</v>

1248
00:53:25.741 --> 00:53:25.950
<v Speaker 4>That was</v>

1249
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.290
<v Speaker 1>a front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1250
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.660
<v Speaker 1>but I shouldn't say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a good friend of mine.</v>

1251
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I would call you a good friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

1252
00:53:32.461 --> 00:53:34.320
<v Speaker 1>You're a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good friend of mine.</v>

1253
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.300
<v Speaker 1>This guy is just a guy that I worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1254
00:53:36.301 --> 00:53:41.301
<v Speaker 1>but he was a very nice guy and he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why I say this,</v>

1255
00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:46.710
<v Speaker 1>if this was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he was alive,</v>

1256
00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I would have stuck with a very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend of mine and one of the reasons </v>

1257
00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:52.290
<v Speaker 1>why I said is he gave me one of my first</v>
<v Speaker 1>headlining gigs.</v>

1258
00:53:52.291 --> 00:53:57.291
<v Speaker 1>He actually booked some clubs back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston and when I was making the </v>

1259
00:53:57.291 --> 00:54:00.801
<v Speaker 1>transition between being a middle act on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road and a headlight and really I </v>

1260
00:54:00.801 --> 00:54:01.920
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a headliner as a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1261
00:54:01.921 --> 00:54:03.720
<v Speaker 1>goddamn amateur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really just amateur.</v>

1262
00:54:03.721 --> 00:54:05.940
<v Speaker 1>The people are paying money to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only been doing it a few years,</v>

1263
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:11.480
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was one of the few guys that gave me </v>

1264
00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:11.480
<v Speaker 1>one of the first guys to give me a </v>
<v Speaker 1>headline and getting.</v>

1265
00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:14.010
<v Speaker 1>But he had a real hypnosis act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was legit.</v>

1266
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.810
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about it on the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1267
00:54:15.811 --> 00:54:18.230
<v Speaker 1>It just wouldn't work with you and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't work in the eye.</v>

1268
00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.360
<v Speaker 1>We think about things too much because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people out there waiting to be</v>

1269
00:54:21.361 --> 00:54:24.720
<v Speaker 1>led and it's very strange because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost seems like some invasion with the</v>

1270
00:54:24.721 --> 00:54:29.721
<v Speaker 1>body snatchers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>invasion of the body snatchers type </v>

1271
00:54:29.721 --> 00:54:31.881
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that are on a </v>

1272
00:54:31.881 --> 00:54:33.981
<v Speaker 1>different frequency than Uri and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to those people and you can get </v>

1273
00:54:33.981 --> 00:54:36.750
<v Speaker 1>them to believe that they're having sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Madonna onstage.</v>

1274
00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:39.990
<v Speaker 1>And then the orgasm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy I saw guy orgasm and his pants.</v>

1275
00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talks to 100 percent,</v>

1276
00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:44.930
<v Speaker 1>paid some money for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd pay money to someone.</v>

1277
00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:50.250
<v Speaker 1>I used to work at stitches comedy Club </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Boston and this guy,</v>

1278
00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Frank Santos would come in every week </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he would do like,</v>

1279
00:54:53.611 --> 00:54:54.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a Gig,</v>

1280
00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:56.730
<v Speaker 1>like maybe it was a Tuesday night or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1281
00:54:56.830 --> 00:55:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Everyone would feel the way Boston was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the old days in the golden days of </v>

1282
00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:02.880
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone had a night of the week,</v>

1283
00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:05.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Wednesday night would be Kevin Knox</v>

1284
00:55:05.041 --> 00:55:08.400
<v Speaker 1>tonight at Nick's comedy stop and one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nights was Frank Santos night.</v>

1285
00:55:08.401 --> 00:55:13.401
<v Speaker 1>So Frank Santos would come by and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would sit in the back and watch because </v>

1286
00:55:13.401 --> 00:55:16.620
<v Speaker 1>it took comics a while for it to go from</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just start working at the club.</v>

1287
00:55:16.621 --> 00:55:18.930
<v Speaker 1>What is this are already did hypnosis </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1288
00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:20.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frank Santos is onstage,</v>

1289
00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.470
<v Speaker 1>let's go watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that,</v>

1290
00:55:22.471 --> 00:55:24.000
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the natural progression.</v>

1291
00:55:24.001 --> 00:55:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Once you realized it was real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would always,</v>

1292
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:30.810
<v Speaker 1>if I was outside the room and I knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Frank Santos was on the stage,</v>

1293
00:55:30.811 --> 00:55:35.811
<v Speaker 1>I had to get in the room to see what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to do because he really could </v>

1294
00:55:35.811 --> 00:55:39.381
<v Speaker 1>get people to believe that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>having sex and he was the r rated </v>

1295
00:55:39.381 --> 00:55:39.381
<v Speaker 1>hypnotist.</v>

1296
00:55:39.381 --> 00:55:40.410
<v Speaker 1>So it was always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1297
00:55:40.411 --> 00:55:41.490
<v Speaker 1>you got your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1298
00:55:41.491 --> 00:55:46.491
<v Speaker 1>your lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was weird because this weird </v>

1299
00:55:46.491 --> 00:55:48.651
<v Speaker 1>voice because you barely could </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it because I wrote those </v>

1300
00:55:48.651 --> 00:55:49.380
<v Speaker 1>words together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas it was together,</v>

1301
00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:50.370
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1302
00:55:50.371 --> 00:55:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a boobies are on top of you right</v>

1303
00:55:52.171 --> 00:55:53.140
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where your boobies,</v>

1304

1307
00:55:59.341 --> 00:56:04.341
<v Speaker 1>these morons really do get hypnotized </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it is just easily.</v>

1308
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:08.150
<v Speaker 1>There are some people that their brains </v>
<v Speaker 1>work different than you and I.</v>

1309
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.150

1319
00:56:34.141 --> 00:56:39.030
<v Speaker 2>So we uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so I don't know if it's because of </v>

1320
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:41.850
<v Speaker 2>the first time we talked and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were saying like you,</v>

1321
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you were into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then lately I've just been playing </v>

1322
00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:47.560
<v Speaker 2>with fire on stage to see how far you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can take it.</v>

1323
00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:50.050
<v Speaker 2>And it's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's hypnotism.</v>

1324
00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:53.410
<v Speaker 2>It definitely is inhibited them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are personalities that you can</v>

1325
00:56:53.411 --> 00:56:56.710
<v Speaker 2>read from stage and you go that personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>play with me,</v>

00:56:56.711 --> 00:56:58.240
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll bring them up.</v>

1327
00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Like I brought these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blockchain might not have ever been as </v>

1328
00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:06.661
<v Speaker 2>playful either until they met you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they just this people that are just </v>

1329
00:57:06.661 --> 00:57:07.060
<v Speaker 2>willing to go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1330
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:08.010
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a,</v>

1331
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:13.020
<v Speaker 2>I was in Miami and I brought a black </v>
<v Speaker 2>chick and a Puerto Rican checkup on </v>

1332
00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:14.560
<v Speaker 2>stage and I had them cut the lights off </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

1333
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.270
<v Speaker 2>when you said that you were a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>urban,</v>

1334
00:57:16.271 --> 00:57:17.730
<v Speaker 2>and the lady said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you notice it?</v>

1335
00:57:17.731 --> 00:57:22.731
<v Speaker 2>I notice them on staying mobile phase </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1336
00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:31.020
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had them cut the lights and I </v>

1337
00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:31.020
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So it's pitch black so the audience </v>

1340
00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:35.730
<v Speaker 2>doesn't see anything.</v>

1341
00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:36.100
<v Speaker 2>The audience can't see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1342
00:57:36.101 --> 00:57:38.480
<v Speaker 2>it's like now it's like a radio show.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I have nothing to do with it.</v>

1359
00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:20.160
<v Speaker 2>But these girls who come out of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>shells and then I walked back in and I </v>

1364
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:31.920
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do believe you can read people </v>

1365
00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:32.470
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I said I don't know if I,</v>

1366
00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:37.530
<v Speaker 2>maybe I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I would never do that with a </v>

1367
00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:37.530
<v Speaker 2>white person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought it.</v>

1368
00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:37.530
<v Speaker 2>Just bring a Puerto Ricans and blacks on</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>

1369
00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:39.820
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't try and white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they wouldn't do that.</v>

1370
00:58:39.821 --> 00:58:44.821
<v Speaker 2>White people have a tendency to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be funny and they and sometimes because </v>

1371
00:58:45.401 --> 00:58:50.401
<v Speaker 2>they've listened to my show and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I'll say like edgy shit about </v>

1372
00:58:50.401 --> 00:58:54.061
<v Speaker 2>race because I've taken liberties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They then feel like they can and they'll</v>

1373
00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:58.360
<v Speaker 2>drop an f bomb or oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes me so on.</v>

1374
00:58:58.361 --> 00:59:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Urban people are hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at this hotel watching them swim,</v>

1375
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:01.980
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>

<v Speaker 2>trying to hold her phone up above water </v>

1385
00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:35.750

<v Speaker 2>swim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:39.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm making generalizations right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now that I don't want them to sound </v>

<v Speaker 4>You don't want to wear them so sad.</v>

1609
01:09:37.890 --> 01:09:41.740
<v Speaker 4>You've got to get the ones that flip up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and fold up like old congressmen have.</v>

1610
01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:43.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can read this easily,</v>

1611
01:09:43.161 --> 01:09:44.570
<v Speaker 4>but not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not as clear.</v>

1612
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:47.240
<v Speaker 4>My Dad has these glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're magical.</v>

1613
01:09:47.241 --> 01:09:49.510
<v Speaker 4>They go one side as far sided.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One side is normal,</v>

1614
01:09:49.511 --> 01:09:49.670
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>

1615
01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:54.750
<v Speaker 3>if he ever wants to read something in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 30 some magic,</v>

1616
01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:05.210
<v Speaker 3>there's a man named Harry Potter and </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives in the castle and he solved the </v>

1617
01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:07.560
<v Speaker 3>problem of vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The warlock lenscrafters gave it to.</v>

1618
01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:09.880
<v Speaker 3>I wonder men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first dude to come up with glasses,</v>

1619
01:10:09.881 --> 01:10:11.560
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He must've been a goddamn wizard.</v>

1620
01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:13.660
<v Speaker 3>Who's the first guy that got girls to </v>
<v Speaker 3>swallow?</v>

1621
01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:17.200
<v Speaker 3>That shit's been going on since the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stone age.</v>

1622
01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:19.300
<v Speaker 3>There's no one who could hold claim to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1623
01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:21.550
<v Speaker 3>There's probably a few charlatans from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 15 hundreds.</v>

1624
01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:22.910
<v Speaker 3>I was the first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1625
01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:23.380
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1626
01:10:23.381 --> 01:10:28.381
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cave man bitches were sucking dicks </v>

1627
01:10:28.381 --> 01:10:28.720
<v Speaker 3>and swollen loads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Loads contain nutrients.</v>

1628
01:10:28.721 --> 01:10:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Back then you had to learn hard to stay </v>
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>

1629
01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:33.530
<v Speaker 3>GNC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you drank your piercing.</v>

1630
01:10:33.531 --> 01:10:35.810
<v Speaker 3>He swallowed other people's loads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>

1631
01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.250
<v Speaker 3>You don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just want to be healthy.</v>

1632
01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:42.640
<v Speaker 3>It's tapioca pudding son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alphacam</v>

1633
01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:43.910
<v Speaker 4>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1634
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:49.310
<v Speaker 4>Alpha Alpha nails with my Alphacam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you noticed with those pills,</v>

1635
01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:51.750
<v Speaker 4>those pills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1636
01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:52.410
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

1637
01:10:52.411 --> 01:10:57.411
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people online that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>like crying about it because they will </v>

1638
01:10:57.411 --> 01:10:57.900
<v Speaker 4>know no one who's known as Tegan is </v>
<v Speaker 4>crying about it.</v>

1639
01:10:57.901 --> 01:10:58.460
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1640
01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.270
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guy I met loves it.</v>

1641
01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:05.290
<v Speaker 4>He don't want to believe that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that you can take that can </v>

1642
01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:09.111
<v Speaker 4>actually enhance brain function.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this would be like the biggest </v>

1643
01:11:09.111 --> 01:11:09.111
<v Speaker 4>thing that ever happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Neuroscience,</v>

1644
01:11:09.111 --> 01:11:13.020
<v Speaker 4>we're not talking about some limitless </v>
<v Speaker 4>pill that you take and all of a sudden </v>

1645
01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:13.590
<v Speaker 4>you're super genius,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're talking about is you when you</v>

1646
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:19.010
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have moments where you feel at your </v>

1647
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:19.010
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1648
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>

1649
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:20.160
<v Speaker 1>But it's at your best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not on steroids.</v>

1650
01:11:20.161 --> 01:11:22.250
<v Speaker 1>You're not on limitless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You not on some craziest,</v>

1651
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:27.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's you at your best and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments are hard to attain and I think </v>

1652
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:29.520
<v Speaker 1>they have a lot to do with rest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition.</v>

1653
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:34.260
<v Speaker 1>I think you at your best has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>what your body is processing.</v>

1654
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:37.450
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Processing good foods and vegetables and</v>

1655
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:39.600
<v Speaker 1>vitamins and everything is smooth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

1656
01:11:39.610 --> 01:11:42.270
<v Speaker 1>It's got everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's required and when you do that,</v>

1657
01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:42.920
<v Speaker 1>things work</v>

1658
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:44.010
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>

1659
01:11:44.011 --> 01:11:49.011
<v Speaker 2>I started not drinking on Thursday and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Friday and Saturday,</v>

1660
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday.</v>

1661
01:11:50.071 --> 01:11:53.040
<v Speaker 2>I blow it out a bit on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not drinking on Thursday.</v>

1662
01:11:53.041 --> 01:11:54.990
<v Speaker 2>Going up on stage too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that going to bed,</v>

1663
01:11:54.991 --> 01:11:56.820
<v Speaker 2>getting a good night's sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working out Thursday,</v>

1664
01:11:56.821 --> 01:11:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday,</v>

1665
01:11:57.451 --> 01:12:02.451
<v Speaker 2>Sunday workout every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eat healthy at the clubs and then </v>

1666
01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:03.210
<v Speaker 2>whatever I can get around the club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the hotel.</v>

1667
01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:05.700
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm grant funding.</v>

1668
01:12:05.701 --> 01:12:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I did it one weekend but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1669
01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:13.570
<v Speaker 2>but I felt good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt really good and I thought I </v>

1670
01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:13.570
<v Speaker 2>started thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1671
01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:17.850
<v Speaker 2>that there is something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this last weekend in Atlanta,</v>

1672
01:12:17.851 --> 01:12:20.820
<v Speaker 2>I was on a bender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a drink every morning.</v>

1673
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:23.670
<v Speaker 2>I drank every morning on radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drank every,</v>

1674
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
<v Speaker 2>every evening on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent the whole night out all night </v>

1675
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.150
<v Speaker 2>and then every day like my friends would</v>
<v Speaker 2>come down and we'd go drinking or Jesus.</v>

1676
01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:32.760
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a bender.</v>

<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1679
01:12:36.421 --> 01:12:39.100
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if I'm dehydrated as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you will.</v>

1685
01:12:51.811 --> 01:12:56.811
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you don't want any drink on </v>

<v Speaker 7>He could've been doing something there.</v>

1719
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:47.180
<v Speaker 7>He maybe he did that for confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who's worried about,</v>

1720
01:14:47.210 --> 01:14:52.210
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he had talked to a lot of shit about me </v>

1721
01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:52.210
<v Speaker 7>and then all of sudden is going to be on</v>
<v Speaker 7>a podcast and he also,</v>

1722
01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:56.090
<v Speaker 7>because he also,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the only reason I ever think this is </v>

1723
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:56.090
<v Speaker 7>because I noticed that he went to the </v>
<v Speaker 7>bathroom four times,</v>

1724
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:57.800
<v Speaker 7>but that also that he was saying he was </v>
<v Speaker 7>sober,</v>

1725
01:14:57.801 --> 01:14:59.240
<v Speaker 7>but then people at the comedy store is </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

1726
01:14:59.241 --> 01:15:00.680
<v Speaker 7>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was blacking out here last year,</v>

1727
01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:02.000
<v Speaker 7>last night when you told him</v>

1728
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:04.180
<v Speaker 1>me that about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people did at the comedy store.</v>

1729
01:15:04.181 --> 01:15:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Psalm all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1730
01:15:06.011 --> 01:15:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Andy and I have a lot of history and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand Andy in a way that very few</v>

1731
01:15:10.241 --> 01:15:11.360
<v Speaker 1>people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1732
01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:11.770
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

1733
01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:14.350
<v Speaker 1>when I say that I honestly loved the guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wish them the best.</v>

1734
01:15:14.351 --> 01:15:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I honestly do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

1735
01:15:16.861 --> 01:15:20.170
<v Speaker 1>And he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a good person and his best moments,</v>

1736
01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:22.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just crazy as fuck.</v>

1737
01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:27.900
<v Speaker 1>And he blames me for a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his bad times when he was on news </v>

1738
01:15:28.331 --> 01:15:30.550
<v Speaker 1>radio and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is so angry.</v>

1739
01:15:30.551 --> 01:15:35.551
<v Speaker 1>He was so mean to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't realize he was constantly </v>

1740
01:15:35.551 --> 01:15:37.690
<v Speaker 1>pushing my buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was constantly fucking with me and he</v>

1741
01:15:37.691 --> 01:15:39.910
<v Speaker 1>was doing it because it's just in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

1742
01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:44.320
<v Speaker 1>He had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an insane childhood and I don't know the</v>

1743
01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:48.130
<v Speaker 1>full details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know it was not good and you know,</v>

1744
01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:50.080
<v Speaker 1>because of that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1745
01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:53.710
<v Speaker 1>become this incredibly talented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gifted,</v>

1746
01:15:53.711 --> 01:15:56.190
<v Speaker 1>sort of a needy cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1747
01:15:56.230 --> 01:16:01.230
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our relationship has always been very </v>

1748
01:16:01.230 --> 01:16:01.230
<v Speaker 1>strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1749
01:16:01.230 --> 01:16:02.290
<v Speaker 1>like he literally bang on my trailer </v>
<v Speaker 1>door,</v>

1750
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:04.390
<v Speaker 1>opened it up and he had his dick in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>

1751
01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.960
<v Speaker 7>but you do understand.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Friend was in the,</v>

1752
01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:09.720
<v Speaker 7>in the room and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>can you guys fuck?</v>

1753
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.630
<v Speaker 7>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>try,</v>

1754
01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:15.650
<v Speaker 7>I mean it was fucking serious.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But you do understand that even though </v>

1755
01:16:15.650 --> 01:16:16.290
<v Speaker 7>when he was on the show that might've </v>
<v Speaker 7>been like to you,</v>

1756
01:16:16.291 --> 01:16:18.240
<v Speaker 7>but that was in lot of people's </v>
<v Speaker 7>opinions,</v>

1757
01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:22.740
<v Speaker 7>the best fucking duo ever watching you </v>
<v Speaker 7>and gather.</v>

1758
01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:25.920
<v Speaker 7>It's probably one of the best things </v>
<v Speaker 7>I've ever seen in my whole entire life.</v>

1759
01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we did the show and we did the </v>

1760
01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:33.351
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had this weird love hate </v>

1761
01:16:33.351 --> 01:16:34.791
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Andy could make me laugh harder </v>

1762
01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:34.791
<v Speaker 1>than anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1763
01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:38.121
<v Speaker 1>when we did scenes together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to redo things like three </v>

1764
01:16:38.121 --> 01:16:39.300
<v Speaker 1>or four times because I couldn't stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>cracking up.</v>

1765
01:16:39.301 --> 01:16:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't help myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had this one where there was pencils.</v>

1766
01:16:42.511 --> 01:16:47.511
<v Speaker 1>I had pencils in my hand and one of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>was obviously way longer than the other </v>

1767
01:16:47.511 --> 01:16:51.231
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the longest one is like the </v>

1768
01:16:51.231 --> 01:16:52.820
<v Speaker 1>attack and it gets in my face and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1769
01:16:52.821 --> 01:16:55.860
<v Speaker 1>it's just studying it and I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop laughing.</v>

1770
01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:57.090
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

1771
01:16:57.090 --> 01:17:02.090
<v Speaker 7>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remember falling in love with that </v>

1772
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:02.090
<v Speaker 7>show.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's not that guy anymore.</v>

1773
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:03.240
<v Speaker 7>He's now he's Andy at 50 or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It is.</v>

1774
01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:06.120
<v Speaker 7>So sad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What did he say?</v>

1775
01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:08.190
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what's that look?</v>

1776
01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:10.130
<v Speaker 7>Here's the root of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Forget all</v>

1777
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:12.980
<v Speaker 1>the words that came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the intention behind it?</v>

1778
01:17:12.981 --> 01:17:17.981
<v Speaker 1>The intention behind it is to lash out </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Howard stern so that Howard stern in </v>

1779
01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:23.180
<v Speaker 1>turn lashes back and maybe there's room </v>
<v Speaker 1>for reconciliation and all this is just </v>

1780
01:17:24.531 --> 01:17:28.100
<v Speaker 1>giant sums of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was money,</v>

1781
01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:31.600
<v Speaker 1>it would be a financial downpour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's attention.</v>

1782
01:17:31.670 --> 01:17:36.670
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he probably doesn't even realize it </v>

1783
01:17:36.670 --> 01:17:39.461
<v Speaker 1>when he's saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Howard starting to do anything to </v>

1784
01:17:39.461 --> 01:17:39.461
<v Speaker 1>him and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1785
01:17:39.461 --> 01:17:39.461
<v Speaker 7>what did I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did he owe money?</v>

1786
01:17:39.461 --> 01:17:40.980
<v Speaker 7>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

1787
01:17:41.010 --> 01:17:42.870
<v Speaker 7>Howard stern doesn't know a fucking say </v>
<v Speaker 7>human.</v>

1788
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:47.520
<v Speaker 2>He called him when Charlie Sheen was one</v>
<v Speaker 2>the show and wanted to like put his,</v>

1789
01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.940
<v Speaker 2>he just wanted attention when Charlie </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sheen was darn electronic,</v>

1790
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Jane or Charlie Sheen was there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Howard wouldn't take the call and he</v>

1791
01:17:54.241 --> 01:17:55.650
<v Speaker 2>said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andy's,</v>

1792
01:17:55.710 --> 01:17:57.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we going to take listen to him?</v>

1793
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:59.940
<v Speaker 2>He's living in a fucking trailer in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>back of his house.</v>

1794
01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:02.490
<v Speaker 2>He is or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Andy got upset,</v>

1795
01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:05.220
<v Speaker 2>lashed out at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Howard all greg show.</v>

1796
01:18:05.221 --> 01:18:08.140
<v Speaker 2>And I heard Howard talk about it and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1797
01:18:08.141 --> 01:18:10.750
<v Speaker 2>it really was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1798
01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:13.860
<v Speaker 2>it almost sounded like Michael Richards </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he tried to like,</v>

1799
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:15.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nigger thing,</v>

1800
01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:20.880
<v Speaker 2>almost bain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's super sad.</v>

1801
01:18:21.450 --> 01:18:24.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to say it's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just because I don't want,</v>

1802
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.850
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to put that energy out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1803
01:18:26.851 --> 01:18:31.851
<v Speaker 2>but it is because man Andy was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was so fucking talented.</v>

1804
01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:34.230
<v Speaker 7>He still towns,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's just crazy.</v>

1805
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:35.650
<v Speaker 7>Some layers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It still cracks me up.</v>

1806
01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:37.970
<v Speaker 7>I don't care if he's sober.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's still cracks me up.</v>

1807
01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:40.360
<v Speaker 7>He's not doing good right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what the problem is.</v>

1808
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:42.670
<v Speaker 7>If he was doing good,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if he was on a sitcom right now and he's</v>

1809
01:18:42.671 --> 01:18:43.020
<v Speaker 7>making</v>

1810
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:48.250
<v Speaker 1>tons of cash and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he could fuck off and then pull it </v>

1811
01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:48.470
<v Speaker 1>back together again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be okay.</v>

1812
01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:51.080
<v Speaker 1>The problem is right now he's not on st </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's in.</v>

1813
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:56.470
<v Speaker 1>He's in a bad place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good and so he's lashing out </v>

1814
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.470
<v Speaker 1>with Howard Stern.</v>

1815
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:58.060
<v Speaker 2>I think the lesson is don't ever tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>people you're quitting drinking.</v>

1816
01:18:58.061 --> 01:18:58.570
<v Speaker 2>Just quote</v>

1817
01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:01.200
<v Speaker 1>he was he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did it and then he would say,</v>

1818
01:19:01.201 --> 01:19:02.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's forever.</v>

1819
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:04.620
<v Speaker 7>I don't know though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>His response,</v>

1820
01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:07.540
<v Speaker 7>like Howard Stern's response to it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That kind of freaked me out because it's</v>

1821
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:08.530
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dude,</v>

1822
01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:10.620
<v Speaker 7>why are you going off on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what was it?</v>

1823
01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:12.060
<v Speaker 7>Thirty minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>40 minutes.</v>

1824
01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:17.210
<v Speaker 7>You immediately snapped and now like </v>
<v Speaker 7>this guy that you obviously know it's </v>

<v Speaker 7>you're fucking destroying him in 30 </v>

<v Speaker 7>minutes and like him and robin just like</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kinda tore andy apart.</v>

1827
01:19:21.630 --> 01:19:26.630
<v Speaker 7>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have to understand where Andy is </v>

1828
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.630
<v Speaker 7>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And like,</v>

1829
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:27.930
<v Speaker 7>like you pretty much exposed yourself </v>
<v Speaker 7>and just saying like,</v>

<v Speaker 7>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't give a shit about this dude.</v>

1831
01:19:29.761 --> 01:19:31.800
<v Speaker 7>So even if you have some qualms with </v>
<v Speaker 7>this guy,</v>

1832
01:19:32.010 --> 01:19:37.010
<v Speaker 7>you just pretty much just expose </v>
<v Speaker 7>yourself as like thinking this guy is </v>

1833
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.350
<v Speaker 7>the worst person in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 7>At least that's what I got from it.</v>

1834
01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:39.890
<v Speaker 7>I don't understand what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He just,</v>

1835
01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:40.930
<v Speaker 7>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he,</v>

1836
01:19:40.931 --> 01:19:41.700
<v Speaker 7>he,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he like,</v>

1837
01:19:41.701 --> 01:19:46.701
<v Speaker 7>he really focused on what Andy said </v>
<v Speaker 7>about being a Jew or being like a Jew </v>

1838
01:19:46.701 --> 01:19:46.701
<v Speaker 7>Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nose,</v>

1839
01:19:46.701 --> 01:19:48.690
<v Speaker 7>Jew or whatever he like.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if you look at old school,</v>

1840
01:19:48.691 --> 01:19:53.691
<v Speaker 7>Howard Stern,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Howard stern was the first person to </v>

1841
01:19:53.691 --> 01:19:53.691
<v Speaker 7>like make fun of blacks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Make Fun of fucking Italians.</v>

1842
01:19:53.691 --> 01:19:53.910
<v Speaker 7>Make Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

1843
01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:58.530
<v Speaker 7>like Howard used to be like this risky </v>
<v Speaker 7>guy and he focused so much on like being</v>

1844
01:19:58.531 --> 01:19:59.840
<v Speaker 7>called a Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

1845
01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:04.850
<v Speaker 7>like it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like it seemed like the whole thing was </v>

1846
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:04.850
<v Speaker 7>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like some anger at.</v>

1847
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:05.250
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

1848
01:20:05.251 --> 01:20:07.430
<v Speaker 7>Like kind of misordered knowing you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>talking about.</v>

1849
01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:08.880
<v Speaker 7>But honestly</v>

1850
01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.480
<v Speaker 1>when I was hearing that I was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1851
01:20:10.481 --> 01:20:12.780
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so low level.</v>

1852
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:17.070
<v Speaker 1>This is such a low level move to ses at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Julie's a hook,</v>

1853
01:20:17.071 --> 01:20:18.540
<v Speaker 1>nose Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1854
01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.020
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

1855
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.470
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just more on shit.</v>

1856
01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:23.940
<v Speaker 1>And it's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1857
01:20:23.941 --> 01:20:28.941
<v Speaker 1>you're just going after this stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes after about himself and you're </v>

1858
01:20:28.941 --> 01:20:31.350
<v Speaker 1>going after it and you're saying he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a sore spot.</v>

1859
01:20:31.351 --> 01:20:33.270
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

1860
01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:37.470
<v Speaker 1>It's just idiotic because what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his reaction to it,</v>

1861
01:20:37.471 --> 01:20:41.640
<v Speaker 1>you gotta realize Howard Stern is an old</v>
<v Speaker 1>school dude.</v>

1862
01:20:41.690 --> 01:20:42.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's older than us,</v>

1863
01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:44.490
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been around a long time,</v>

1864
01:20:44.491 --> 01:20:47.790
<v Speaker 1>pre internet and he grew up in a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>black community man.</v>

1865
01:20:47.791 --> 01:20:52.791
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of racist or calling them a </v>

1866
01:20:52.791 --> 01:20:52.791
<v Speaker 1>Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calling them a Jew is.</v>

1867
01:20:52.791 --> 01:20:54.270
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel good man.</v>

1868
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:57.120
<v Speaker 1>It feels fucking shitty and it feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>like something that he has to defend.</v>

1869
01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:58.830
<v Speaker 1>And when he says that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anybody,</v>

1870
01:20:58.950 --> 01:21:02.280
<v Speaker 1>if this guy did this rant about any </v>
<v Speaker 1>other ethnicity,</v>

1871
01:21:02.281 --> 01:21:06.180
<v Speaker 1>if he did this rant about black people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would be all over the fucking news.</v>

1872
01:21:06.181 --> 01:21:11.181
<v Speaker 1>People would be talking about let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>blackball hamlet's never hire him again </v>

1873
01:21:11.181 --> 01:21:12.480
<v Speaker 1>because he's running off at the mouth </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Jews.</v>

1874
01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Nobody cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the presumption is that Jews run</v>

1875
01:21:16.291 --> 01:21:18.480
<v Speaker 1>show business anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh poor,</v>

1876
01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:19.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$500.</v>

1877
01:21:19.741 --> 01:21:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Millionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Howard Stern.</v>

1878
01:21:21.511 --> 01:21:23.050
<v Speaker 1>It gets called a Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1879
01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be okay.</v>

1880
01:21:24.730 --> 01:21:25.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the presumption.</v>

1881
01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:28.500
<v Speaker 1>You don't know when you really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with Howard though.</v>

1882
01:21:28.501 --> 01:21:29.090
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1883
01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:31.080
<v Speaker 1>you got to point it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this was,</v>

1884
01:21:31.081 --> 01:21:33.540
<v Speaker 1>if he was talking to my gaze and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't gay,</v>

1885
01:21:33.541 --> 01:21:34.650
<v Speaker 1>but he was gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if he is gay,</v>

1886
01:21:34.651 --> 01:21:36.330
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy talked about gays,</v>

1887
01:21:36.331 --> 01:21:37.260
<v Speaker 1>that they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1888
01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:42.320
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he had sort of gay gay style </v>

1889
01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:46.010
<v Speaker 1>sometimes at times every day being in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcasts and it him sitting next to </v>

1890
01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:47.340
<v Speaker 1>me and going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1891
01:21:47.341 --> 01:21:48.690
<v Speaker 1>so attracted to you</v>

1892
01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:53.470
<v Speaker 4>going back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No fucking way.</v>

1893
01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:54.580
<v Speaker 4>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never do that.</v>

1894
01:21:54.581 --> 01:21:55.420
<v Speaker 4>You never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1895
01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:55.770
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1896
01:21:55.810 --> 01:22:00.810
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing good about killing him </v>

1897
01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:01.160
<v Speaker 4>with my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

1898
01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:07.100
<v Speaker 4>He always scared for you go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no follow up to that interview.</v>

1899
01:22:08.250 --> 01:22:13.250
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying that you thought the </v>

1900
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:13.250
<v Speaker 4>interview was really awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1901
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:13.250
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1902
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:13.270
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was uncomfortable for me,</v>

1903
01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:15.140
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't think it was an </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting,</v>

1904
01:22:15.610 --> 01:22:16.270
<v Speaker 1>very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1905
01:22:16.271 --> 01:22:16.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1906
01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:18.520
<v Speaker 1>And he's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1907
01:22:18.521 --> 01:22:20.220
<v Speaker 1>if Andy and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1908
01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:23.380
<v Speaker 1>if this is a true story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a true statement.</v>

1909
01:22:23.381 --> 01:22:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Rather if a sitcom came up and they said</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to do a sitcom with you and andy</v>

1910
01:22:28.301 --> 01:22:33.301
<v Speaker 1>and we're pretty sure we've got andy </v>
<v Speaker 1>under control and Andy is talking to a </v>

1911
01:22:33.301 --> 01:22:34.450
<v Speaker 1>therapist and he's on this new thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's called Zoloft,</v>

1912
01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Tinian</v>

1913
01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:38.250
<v Speaker 4>fucking insights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of Zoloft.</v>

1914
01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.510
<v Speaker 4>And apparently it's totally leveled them</v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

1915
01:22:40.511 --> 01:22:41.920
<v Speaker 4>but he's funnier than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they let her.</v>

1916
01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's only allowed to smoke pot.</v>

1917
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1918
01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.030
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What network?</v>

1919
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:49.340
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1920
01:22:49.341 --> 01:22:53.030
<v Speaker 4>I loved working with that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if he said all those things,</v>

1921
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.410
<v Speaker 4>what about</v>

1922
01:22:53.410 --> 01:22:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Howard that he said about me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't hurt me as much as it hurt </v>

1923
01:22:58.410 --> 01:22:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Howard or make me as man because I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>who he is.</v>

1924
01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I know you can't trick me with a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of noise that comes out of your mouth.</v>

1925
01:23:03.041 --> 01:23:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I know where it all comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1926
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.960
<v Speaker 1>I know the fiber of his being in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

1927
01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:09.760
<v Speaker 1>He's crazy as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1928
01:23:09.761 --> 01:23:12.160
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't know what he really means </v>
<v Speaker 1>by all this.</v>

1929
01:23:12.161 --> 01:23:14.680
<v Speaker 1>As he feels abandoned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got nothing going on.</v>

1930
01:23:14.681 --> 01:23:17.590
<v Speaker 1>And so he lashes out and he says fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up shit like that.</v>

1931
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:19.510
<v Speaker 1>But that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

1932
01:23:19.511 --> 01:23:21.550
<v Speaker 1>when Howard got all mad and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1933
01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.500
<v Speaker 1>and freaked out about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw his point,</v>

1934
01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:27.970
<v Speaker 1>but I also saw a point where someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be right next to Howard going,</v>

1935
01:23:27.971 --> 01:23:29.710
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not about this guy,</v>

1936
01:23:29.711 --> 01:23:31.630
<v Speaker 1>this guy to go over this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out.</v>

1937
01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Because he was going off about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1938
01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:39.301
<v Speaker 1>number one in the market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you try going into a market and </v>

1939
01:23:39.301 --> 01:23:39.830

<v Speaker 1>why all these comedians on Corolla?</v>

1940
01:23:39.850 --> 01:23:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was going off about why these </v>

1941
01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:44.850
<v Speaker 1>comedians are jealous of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why know?</v>

1942
01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Why do they say things about me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1943

<v Speaker 5>here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you walk around my house,</v>

1946
01:23:56.171 --> 01:23:58.451
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to sit around listening to </v>

1947
01:23:58.451 --> 01:23:58.451
<v Speaker 5>lenny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bruce.</v>

1948
01:23:58.451 --> 01:23:58.451
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1949
01:23:58.451 --> 01:24:02.531
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like I listen to them every </v>

1950
01:24:02.531 --> 01:24:02.531
<v Speaker 5>day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in my mind,</v>

1951
01:24:02.531 --> 01:24:06.640
<v Speaker 5>the only way I would've ever gotten to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do what I'm doing with my life is if </v>

1952
01:24:07.101 --> 01:24:10.070
<v Speaker 5>there was some bad mother fucker from </v>
<v Speaker 5>the sixties,</v>

<v Speaker 5>a risk taker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It didn't.</v>

1955
01:24:18.010 --> 01:24:21.230
<v Speaker 5>He got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They put them in jail for saying certain</v>

1956
01:24:21.231 --> 01:24:26.231
<v Speaker 5>words.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a guy who got on stage in front </v>

01:24:26.231 --> 01:24:26.231
<v Speaker 5>of a bunch of people in a mixed audience</v>
<v Speaker 5>and started calling.</v>

1958
01:24:26.231 --> 01:24:27.400
<v Speaker 5>Where are the niggers were the </v>
<v Speaker 5>negatives?</v>

<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1966
01:24:36.231 --> 01:24:38.180
<v Speaker 5>He was with a spic dirty spic right </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1967
01:24:38.181 --> 01:24:39.620
<v Speaker 5>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's a SPEC.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Are you saying?</v>

1971
01:24:45.351 --> 01:24:50.351
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he said that he had this whole bit </v>

1972
01:24:50.351 --> 01:24:51.110
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you say that enough,</v>

1973
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:53.750
<v Speaker 5>then it's not going to hurt a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>kid's feelings.</v>

1974
01:24:53.751 --> 01:24:58.751
<v Speaker 5>It won't be so shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Will take away the power from this </v>

1975
01:24:58.751 --> 01:25:02.021
<v Speaker 5>stupid word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was the first guy to use a joke </v>

1976
01:25:02.021 --> 01:25:05.740
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's two jokes that I've heard that </v>

1977
01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.781
<v Speaker 5>people ripped off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They probably didn't even realize they </v>

1978
01:25:07.781 --> 01:25:07.781
<v Speaker 5>ripped off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they were lenny bruce jokes.</v>

1979
01:25:07.781 --> 01:25:10.460
<v Speaker 5>One of them was he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being a homosexual is illegal.</v>

1980
01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:15.490
<v Speaker 5>Dig.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what would happen is when the see </v>

1981
01:25:15.490 --> 01:25:15.490
<v Speaker 5>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they arrest you,</v>

1982
01:25:15.490 --> 01:25:18.851
<v Speaker 5>they put you in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but men want to have sex with you mean </v>

1983
01:25:18.851 --> 01:25:20.060
<v Speaker 5>we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In our.</v>

1984
01:25:20.061 --> 01:25:23.540
<v Speaker 5>In our context of our society in 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our,</v>

1985
01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:28.810
<v Speaker 5>our level of social evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're far beyond where we were in the </v>

1986
01:25:28.810 --> 01:25:32.561
<v Speaker 5>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this guy in the sixties was fucking </v>

1987
01:25:32.561 --> 01:25:34.690
<v Speaker 5>revolutionary and so that's why I have </v>
<v Speaker 5>posters of money,</v>

1988
01:25:34.691 --> 01:25:38.120
<v Speaker 5>bruises all over my house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to talk about radio,</v>

1989
01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:43.660
<v Speaker 5>there's only one guy you want to talk </v>
<v Speaker 5>about and that's Howard stern and that </v>

1990
01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:45.860
<v Speaker 5>is a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck what you say.</v>

1991
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:51.070
<v Speaker 5>That guy is revolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's the one guy who stepped in when </v>

1992
01:25:51.531 --> 01:25:56.270
<v Speaker 5>everybody was doing the same stupid shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he took chances.</v>

1993
01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.580
<v Speaker 5>He did crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

1994
01:25:58.670 --> 01:26:03.670
<v Speaker 5>he went deep and dark and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he really means all the things </v>

1995
01:26:03.670 --> 01:26:04.080
<v Speaker 5>that he's saying he wants to putting</v>

1996
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.680
<v Speaker 1>on a show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme entertainment,</v>

1997
01:26:06.681 --> 01:26:09.260
<v Speaker 1>extreme and attainment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in doing so,</v>

1998
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:12.440
<v Speaker 1>you put out a lot of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take a lot of chances,</v>

1999
01:26:12.441 --> 01:26:17.441
<v Speaker 1>you expose yourself and you become very </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive and through all of his </v>

2000
01:26:17.441 --> 01:26:20.951
<v Speaker 1>attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's become more sensitive </v>

2001
01:26:20.951 --> 01:26:21.980
<v Speaker 1>because I don't think that Howard stern </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 10,</v>

2002
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:25.110
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago would have reacted the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>he reacted to any deck.</v>

2003
01:26:25.111 --> 01:26:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Now I think he would mock Andy Dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think,</v>

2004
01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:30.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say he was correcting </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is incorrect,</v>

2005
01:26:30.171 --> 01:26:32.090
<v Speaker 1>but if Andy says something about me like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2006
01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:36.400
<v Speaker 1>I would have it on and I would start </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing and say I need to call</v>

2007
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:37.870
<v Speaker 4>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2008
01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:42.880
<v Speaker 4>life counselor was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do I need to do to get my life in </v>

2009
01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:42.880
<v Speaker 4>order?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2010
01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:44.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm a hook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No Jew is fix the sandy.</v>

2011
01:26:44.690 --> 01:26:45.760
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2012
01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:48.140
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you trying to say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>

2013
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:50.860
<v Speaker 4>here's a guy living in a shed who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>giving this advice out,</v>

2014
01:26:50.861 --> 01:26:53.300
<v Speaker 4>which just makes it even more ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's marriage.</v>

2015
01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:55.150
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Him and Howard death.</v>

2016
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not wanting to come.</v>

2017
01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him that well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I knew him that well,</v>

2018
01:26:59.461 --> 01:27:01.320
<v Speaker 1>it do a show more often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him that well.</v>

2019
01:27:01.330 --> 01:27:02.310
<v Speaker 1>She's older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2020
01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Once you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to extreme human being,</v>

2021
01:27:05.691 --> 01:27:10.691
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an extreme example of what's </v>

2022
01:27:10.691 --> 01:27:10.691
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's in any sport,</v>

2023
01:27:10.691 --> 01:27:11.570
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2024
01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:13.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Michael Jordan's a douche bag.</v>

2025
01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:18.730
<v Speaker 1>But you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jordan can dunk from fucking </v>

2026
01:27:18.730 --> 01:27:18.730
<v Speaker 1>half court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so shut the fuck up here.</v>

2027
01:27:18.730 --> 01:27:21.050
<v Speaker 1>We don't know why that guy's a Douche </v>
<v Speaker 1>bag and I'm not.</v>

2028
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:24.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not giving him a free pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not giving anyone a free pass,</v>

2029
01:27:24.651 --> 01:27:28.770
<v Speaker 1>but excellent examples of human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>in any form that doesn't.</v>

2030
01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:30.590
<v Speaker 1>They don't come balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2031
01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:35.330
<v Speaker 1>For someone to reach the highest heights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and set the standards in a way that have</v>

2032
01:27:35.331 --> 01:27:40.331
<v Speaker 1>not been set before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's through comedy or music or </v>

2033
01:27:40.331 --> 01:27:40.331
<v Speaker 1>radio or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person,</v>

2034
01:27:40.331 --> 01:27:44.501
<v Speaker 1>that fucking purse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pioneer way at the front of the </v>

2035
01:27:44.501 --> 01:27:44.840
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running through barriers,</v>

2036
01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:47.810
<v Speaker 1>that guy's not going to be balanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if it was balanced,</v>

2037
01:27:47.811 --> 01:27:49.190
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have the energy to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2038
01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:53.120
<v Speaker 1>The way you have the energy to get there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you are imbalanced.</v>

2039
01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:55.460
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to respect that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2040
01:27:55.461 --> 01:28:00.461
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to grade things on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>curve and you should judge people based </v>

2041
01:28:00.461 --> 01:28:04.751
<v Speaker 1>on their accomplishments almost as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you judge them based on their </v>

2042
01:28:04.751 --> 01:28:05.840
<v Speaker 1>personality to personality is what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>most important.</v>

2043
01:28:05.841 --> 01:28:08.030
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be around them for sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2044
01:28:08.031 --> 01:28:13.031
<v Speaker 1>you don't want someone to around you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that wants to be the king of the world </v>

2045
01:28:13.031 --> 01:28:13.190
<v Speaker 1>and once you know all the conversations </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be about him,</v>

2046
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:18.370
<v Speaker 1>but he got to realize that in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start some giant mega corporation in </v>

2047
01:28:18.370 --> 01:28:18.520
<v Speaker 1>order to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2048
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:22.460
<v Speaker 1>to be the guy at the head of Halliburton</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you really have to be that guy.</v>

2049
01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:24.620
<v Speaker 1>There's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not possible without.</v>

2050
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:25.440
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

2051
01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:26.870
<v Speaker 4>not as.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't just,</v>

2052
01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:27.710
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2053
01:28:27.711 --> 01:28:30.440
<v Speaker 4>I say that sometimes about nine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None of this is really downplaying it,</v>

2054
01:28:30.441 --> 01:28:35.441
<v Speaker 4>but about standup in order to want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>stand in front of a group of strangers </v>

2055
01:28:35.441 --> 01:28:36.440
<v Speaker 4>for an hour and speak something fucked </v>
<v Speaker 4>up with you.</v>

2056
01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:37.820
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say it on stage.</v>

2057
01:28:37.821 --> 01:28:40.790
<v Speaker 4>I do a whole bit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How ridiculous it is that here I am,</v>

2058
01:28:40.791 --> 01:28:41.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

01:28:41.271 --> 01:28:46.271
<v Speaker 4>I want a job where I'm the only one who </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets to talk for an hour in front of a </v>

2060
01:28:46.271 --> 01:28:47.270
<v Speaker 4>bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right there.</v>

2061
01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:48.950
<v Speaker 4>You're right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not like the Internet.</v>

2062
01:28:48.951 --> 01:28:51.890
<v Speaker 4>Like right now we've isolated this </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation where there's only three of us</v>

2063
01:28:51.891 --> 01:28:53.330
<v Speaker 4>in my office and we're hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking,</v>

2064
01:28:53.690 --> 01:28:55.010
<v Speaker 4>but when you're on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2065
01:28:55.050 --> 01:28:57.140
<v Speaker 4>I'll do that shit in front of a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2066
01:28:57.620 --> 01:29:02.620
<v Speaker 4>2000 people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even there's 2000 people in the </v>

2067
01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:02.620
<v Speaker 4>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking and they don't give a shit.</v>

2068
01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:06.410
<v Speaker 2>The weirdest scenario in the world is my</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>

2069
01:29:06.970 --> 01:29:09.860
<v Speaker 2>I went out with a bunch of friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All my friends are single and Atlanta.</v>

2070
01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Single and fucking rich as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like these criminals.</v>

2071
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:15.410

<v Speaker 2>They know they own bars.</v>

2072
01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Like my one buddy owns a bunch of bars </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Tin Lizzy's because they owned </v>

2073
01:29:20.530 --> 01:29:21.350
<v Speaker 2>bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all just wealthy.</v>

2074
01:29:21.351 --> 01:29:24.290
<v Speaker 2>They're just single guys who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing but disposable income,</v>

2075
01:29:24.291 --> 01:29:29.291

<v Speaker 1>seven and a half g's.</v>

2193
01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:38.500
<v Speaker 1>I had a whole bit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

2194
01:34:38.501 --> 01:34:41.200
<v Speaker 1>And one of my specials back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>design was true,</v>

2195
01:34:41.201 --> 01:34:43.540
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was incredible.</v>

2196
01:34:44.050 --> 01:34:45.970
<v Speaker 1>You realize how fast those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>things go.</v>

2197
01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:48.130
<v Speaker 1>You can't even wrap your head around it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2198
01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Who we were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2199
01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:51.460
<v Speaker 1>and these guys were started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2200
01:34:51.461 --> 01:34:52.590
<v Speaker 1>These fucking dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are these,</v>

2201
01:34:52.690 --> 01:34:56.590
<v Speaker 1>these fighter pilots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't be over a certain height because</v>

2202
01:34:56.591 --> 01:34:57.390
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2203
01:34:57.590 --> 01:35:00.110
<v Speaker 1>maximize the amount of g force you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>take.</v>

2204
01:35:00.111 --> 01:35:02.300
<v Speaker 1>You should be short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can do that.</v>

2205
01:35:02.301 --> 01:35:07.301
<v Speaker 1>The hooking thing where you hold onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing or just what the fuck that </v>

2206
01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:08.290
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is as you're hitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2207
01:35:08.291 --> 01:35:13.291
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing what's called hooking and </v>

2208
01:35:13.291 --> 01:35:15.641
<v Speaker 1>you're holding onto the handle and to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this and what you're doing is forcing</v>

2209
01:35:17.781 --> 01:35:22.781
<v Speaker 1>blood into your brain because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure of the g force is literally </v>

2210
01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:25.670
<v Speaker 1>pushing the blood out of your brain.</v>

2211
01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:27.180
<v Speaker 2>I think that would make me black out.</v>

2212
01:35:27.370 --> 01:35:29.450
<v Speaker 1>It course it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it does make you.</v>

2213
01:35:29.451 --> 01:35:33.620
<v Speaker 1>But will that keeps you alive under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under normal conditions.</v>

2214
01:35:33.621 --> 01:35:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that would make you black enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it will,</v>

2215
01:35:36.170 --> 01:35:37.240
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2216
01:35:37.330 --> 01:35:42.330
<v Speaker 1>the pressure is with trying to get you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to blackout and the hooking is what </v>

2217
01:35:42.330 --> 01:35:43.510
<v Speaker 1>makes you stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2218
01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:46.520
<v Speaker 1>we were um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were flying in his fucking fat and we</v>

2219
01:35:46.521 --> 01:35:48.410

2220
01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:50.270
<v Speaker 1>were we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one time we hit,</v>

2221
01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:52.820
<v Speaker 1>we went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went to five and he goes,</v>

01:35:52.821 --> 01:35:55.890
<v Speaker 1>you cool with five?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can handle five and went to six.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're cool with sex.</v>

2224
01:35:56.781 --> 01:35:57.380

<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

2225
01:35:57.381 --> 01:35:58.060
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

2226
01:35:58.340 --> 01:35:58.720
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take this up.</v>

2228
01:35:59.991 --> 01:36:02.810
<v Speaker 1>and we went to seven and a half g's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was hooking to.</v>

2229
01:36:02.811 --> 01:36:04.930
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was freaky to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was going through this.</v>

2230
01:36:06.150 --> 01:36:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Then you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see consciousness like an </v>

2231
01:36:11.150 --> 01:36:14.530
<v Speaker 1>elevator door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see there was darkness on </v>

2232
01:36:14.530 --> 01:36:14.530
<v Speaker 1>either side</v>

2233

01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:02.520
<v Speaker 5>wanted to and not just take your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about this?</v>

2287
01:38:02.521 --> 01:38:04.710
<v Speaker 5>How about taking my life?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I've been doing Jujitsu,</v>

2288
01:38:04.711 --> 01:38:09.711
<v Speaker 5>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>96 and that little dude from Brazil get </v>

2289
01:38:09.711 --> 01:38:12.720
<v Speaker 5>struggled the fuck out of me one day he </v>
<v Speaker 5>wants and that's a reality and I'm </v>

2290
01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.730
<v Speaker 5>almost a black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like high level and there's a lot of</v>

2291
01:38:14.731 --> 01:38:16.980
<v Speaker 5>people have choked out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can choke out some good people,</v>

2292
01:38:16.981 --> 01:38:21.981
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that guy could just tap me anytime </v>

2293
01:38:21.981 --> 01:38:24.261
<v Speaker 5>he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for me to be like almost a black </v>

2294
01:38:24.261 --> 01:38:25.140
<v Speaker 5>belt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might as well have never done Jujitsu.</v>

2295
01:38:25.250 --> 01:38:27.990
<v Speaker 5>I'll just be able to hold them off for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>little is gonna get me.</v>

2296
01:38:27.991 --> 01:38:32.160
<v Speaker 5>It's inevitable that that's the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>reality that exists for most people.</v>

2297
01:38:32.250 --> 01:38:37.250
<v Speaker 5>If you know Jujitsu for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're in some sort of a street </v>

2298
01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:37.410
<v Speaker 5>altercation with someone and you get a </v>
<v Speaker 5>hold of them,</v>

2299
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:39.030
<v Speaker 5>that's why you have to do so.</v>

2300
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:40.740
<v Speaker 5>I have to do hang on because you know </v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

2301
01:38:40.741 --> 01:38:43.830
<v Speaker 5>In class in class,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going 100 percent,</v>

2302
01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:45.500
<v Speaker 5>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2303
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:47.160
<v Speaker 5>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you don't hit each other.</v>

2304
01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:49.560
<v Speaker 5>You're trying to choke and grappling and</v>
<v Speaker 5>grappling.</v>

2305
01:38:49.561 --> 01:38:51.530
<v Speaker 5>You're allowed to go 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't mean you heard it.</v>

2306
01:38:51.531 --> 01:38:52.470
<v Speaker 5>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your partners.</v>

2307
01:38:52.590 --> 01:38:54.430
<v Speaker 5>If you have a lock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have a choke you,</v>

2308
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:56.880
<v Speaker 5>you put it to a certain position and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can just hold it and let it go,</v>

2309
01:38:57.030 --> 01:39:02.030
<v Speaker 5>but the point is it takes 100 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 5>your effort to get to that position and </v>

2310
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.910
<v Speaker 5>that's exactly what's going to come up </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a fight and a fight.</v>

2311
01:39:02.911 --> 01:39:07.911
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be 100 percent effort </v>
<v Speaker 5>except you're used to doing 100 percent </v>

2312
01:39:07.911 --> 01:39:08.280
<v Speaker 5>effort three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>four nights a week,</v>

2313
01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:09.570
<v Speaker 5>three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>four nights a week.</v>

2314
01:39:09.930 --> 01:39:14.930
<v Speaker 5>I go in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's grown men and they're going to </v>

2315
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:17.151
<v Speaker 5>try to kill me with their bare hands and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to try to kill them and then </v>

2316
01:39:17.151 --> 01:39:17.151
<v Speaker 5>we're going to slap hands and we hugged </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I said,</v>

2317
01:39:17.151 --> 01:39:20.130
<v Speaker 5>thanks brother,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we move onto the next guy and you go</v>

2318
01:39:20.131 --> 01:39:21.300
<v Speaker 5>to the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The next one,</v>

2319
01:39:21.301 --> 01:39:24.420
<v Speaker 5>he's tap hands you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go at your slap hands and said,</v>

2320
01:39:24.421 --> 01:39:27.360
<v Speaker 5>everybody does and any lockup and this </v>
<v Speaker 5>is the goal.</v>

2321
01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:32.361
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to try to get you to tap and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're saying when you tap is you </v>

2322
01:39:32.361 --> 01:39:32.550
<v Speaker 5>could have just killed me and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna.</v>

2323
01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:34.360
<v Speaker 5>Try to do the same thing to me and if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you get me,</v>

2324
01:39:34.361 --> 01:39:36.600
<v Speaker 5>it's something I'm going to have to tap </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not going to want to,</v>

2325
01:39:36.601 --> 01:39:38.040
<v Speaker 5>but I'm going to have to because very </v>
<v Speaker 5>important.</v>

2326
01:39:38.041 --> 01:39:38.670
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to die.</v>

2327
01:39:38.930 --> 01:39:42.640
<v Speaker 2>I thought opportunity right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do it.</v>

2328
01:39:42.650 --> 01:39:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Hence Hensville.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Henzel gracie.</v>

2329
01:39:44.890 --> 01:39:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Benzos told me he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on out to the the place and I will </v>

2330

<v Speaker 2>will teach you Jujitsu.</v>

2331
01:39:51.730 --> 01:39:52.810
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you do it.</v>

2332
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:54.790
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2333
01:39:54.791 --> 01:39:56.470
<v Speaker 2>After I did the thing I said that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really cool.</v>

2334
01:39:56.471 --> 01:40:01.471
<v Speaker 2>I felt really grounded when I got dunks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got beaten up a couple times and once </v>

2335
01:40:01.471 --> 01:40:01.900
<v Speaker 2>you get your ass beat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know it's not.</v>

2336
01:40:01.901 --> 01:40:06.901
<v Speaker 2>There's no malice and you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go home to your little sister and she </v>

2337
01:40:06.901 --> 01:40:06.901
<v Speaker 2>looks at you and goes what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

2338
01:40:07.110 --> 01:40:07.410
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

2339
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:12.550
<v Speaker 5>it's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the game is using your body to </v>

2340
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:13.130
<v Speaker 5>dominate another person's body with </v>
<v Speaker 5>technique and leverage.</v>

2341
01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:18.200
<v Speaker 2>I want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do it because there I have so </v>

2342
01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.721
<v Speaker 2>many anxieties of just k.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the reason I want to get a fucking </v>

2343
01:40:20.721 --> 01:40:23.991
<v Speaker 2>massive dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the reason I want to fucking live </v>

2344
01:40:23.991 --> 01:40:23.991
<v Speaker 2>in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason I want to buy a shotgun,</v>

2345
01:40:23.991 --> 01:40:23.991
<v Speaker 2>every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

01:40:23.991 --> 01:40:25.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Iowa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I just,</v>

2347
01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:27.210
<v Speaker 2>the reason I drink on planes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2348
01:40:27.211 --> 01:40:28.870
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid like,</v>

2349
01:40:29.610 --> 01:40:31.770
<v Speaker 2>like you're afraid of a fight on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>plane.</v>

2350
01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

<v Speaker 5>by the way before we get started,</v>

2353
01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:44.730
<v Speaker 5>how many fucking fight stories I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>been started by this fucking thing?</v>

2354
01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:49.820
<v Speaker 2>Got that statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fucking things that like what you got</v>

2355
01:40:53.921 --> 01:40:57.490
<v Speaker 2>in a fight to fucking guy like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement.</v>

2356
01:40:57.491 --> 01:41:00.430
<v Speaker 2>This fucking guy is probably number one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All time.</v>

2357
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the most appearances ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fox Story.</v>

2358
01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Start this fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy had his jumpsuit on.</v>

2359
01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:13.240
<v Speaker 2>He had two jackets on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2360
01:41:13.241 --> 01:41:15.640
<v Speaker 2>So I'm watching him and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2361
01:41:16.050 --> 01:41:21.050
<v Speaker 2>and he kept going to the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went to the bathroom like five times </v>

2362
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:21.070
<v Speaker 2>while I went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once I kept watching him,</v>

2363
01:41:21.071 --> 01:41:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck she doing in the bathroom?</v>

2364
01:41:23.490 --> 01:41:28.490
<v Speaker 2>So then I go in and after it goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the fifth time I go into and it </v>

2365
01:41:28.490 --> 01:41:29.620
<v Speaker 2>smells like Bengay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really fucking,</v>

2366
01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:30.820
<v Speaker 2>like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2367
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:34.240
<v Speaker 2>intense and I go and then I'd watch them</v>
<v Speaker 2>going like five more times.</v>

2368
01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:35.890
<v Speaker 2>And the one time he goes to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathroom,</v>

2369
01:41:35.891 --> 01:41:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I just walk up and I look at him and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

2370
01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:39.190
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing in the bathroom?</v>

2371
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:44.430
<v Speaker 2>And the guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're on top of this guy's bathroom </v>

2372
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:44.430
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

2373
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:45.200
<v Speaker 2>Where you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think you're a cop of deodorant?</v>

2374
01:41:45.201 --> 01:41:45.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

2375
01:41:45.971 --> 01:41:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing is I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he thought I was.</v>

2376
01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:50.800
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't deodorant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized,</v>

2377
01:41:50.801 --> 01:41:55.801
<v Speaker 2>I think I realized what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was smoking something a </v>

2378
01:41:55.801 --> 01:41:58.390
<v Speaker 2>cigarette or those or the fake </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes.</v>

2379
01:41:58.750 --> 01:42:01.810
<v Speaker 2>Electronic cigarettes cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it smelled like,</v>

2380
01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:04.660
<v Speaker 2>like menthol in the back of exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's figured it out.</v>

2381
01:42:04.661 --> 01:42:06.550
<v Speaker 2>But when I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing in there?</v>

2382
01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:08.230
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

2383
01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:08.760
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2384
01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:10.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna go to the bathroom and went </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2385
01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:12.400
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know if he knew who I was,</v>

2386
01:42:12.401 --> 01:42:14.590
<v Speaker 2>but I was thinking if I could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking fight this guy.</v>

2387
01:42:14.890 --> 01:42:15.940
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's this going down?</v>

2388
01:42:15.941 --> 01:42:17.540
<v Speaker 2>He might've thought that you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2389
01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:19.750
<v Speaker 2>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly what I was thinking.</v>

2390
01:42:19.751 --> 01:42:24.751
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them to think anything </v>

2391
01:42:24.751 --> 01:42:24.751
<v Speaker 2>because I'm like the least suspecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>Air Marshall.</v>

2392
01:42:24.751 --> 01:42:26.690
<v Speaker 2>I just want him to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He told me.</v>

2393
01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:35.170
<v Speaker 2>He just gave us crazy eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he told me he wants to go and then I</v>

2394
01:42:35.171 --> 01:42:40.171
<v Speaker 2>realized he was smoking one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes in there probably it was </v>

2395
01:42:40.171 --> 01:42:42.750
<v Speaker 2>sketches of sketchy and he had like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's what the way my crazy brain </v>

2396
01:42:42.750 --> 01:42:45.970
<v Speaker 2>thinks is he had those eyepatch patches </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you put on to sleep on a plane.</v>

2397

<v Speaker 2>Sometimes planes go down.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the one I go on.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And then he kept going and go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So he dips a leaf in a,</v>

2512
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.850
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2513
01:46:49.950 --> 01:46:54.950
<v Speaker 2>in a butter jar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>butter tub of solution and then light </v>

2514
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:58.941
<v Speaker 2>sitting in lights on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The butter thing is obviously gasoline </v>

2515
01:46:58.941 --> 01:46:58.941
<v Speaker 2>going like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2516
01:46:58.941 --> 01:46:58.941
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was,</v>

2517
01:46:58.941 --> 01:47:03.290
<v Speaker 2>I can do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he did it again when I go and he </v>

2518
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:03.290
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch this.</v>

2519
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:06.381
<v Speaker 2>And He poured a little bit and he lit it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the thing exploded and they </v>

2520
01:47:06.381 --> 01:47:08.550
<v Speaker 2>caught him on fire and he went like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I go taking off,</v>

2521
01:47:08.551 --> 01:47:11.520
<v Speaker 2>running to my house and I run into my </v>
<v Speaker 2>house screaming.</v>

2522
01:47:11.521 --> 01:47:13.860
<v Speaker 2>John's on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John's on fire.</v>

2523
01:47:13.861 --> 01:47:16.530
<v Speaker 2>My uncle John is sleeping on the couch </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking he's on fire.</v>

2524
01:47:16.531 --> 01:47:21.531
<v Speaker 2>He's like pissed all over the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I saw that happen and it fucking </v>

2525
01:47:21.531 --> 01:47:23.430
<v Speaker 2>traumatized me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened to the kid?</v>

2548
01:48:16.931 --> 01:48:19.480

<v Speaker 4>So you saw a guy get lit on fire,</v>

<v Speaker 4>He's his pants.</v>

<v Speaker 4>His pants were on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My mom,</v>

2551
01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:23.190

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Don't tell my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we just went home.</v>

2557
01:48:30.341 --> 01:48:32.170
<v Speaker 2>I never really hung out with that kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever again.</v>

2558
01:48:32.730 --> 01:48:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a bunch</v>

2559
01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:37.880
<v Speaker 4>of traumatic shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

2560
01:48:38.090 --> 01:48:43.090
<v Speaker 4>that ain't that big a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but do you ever look at got lit on fire </v>

2561
01:48:43.090 --> 01:48:47.321
<v Speaker 4>and didn't even get hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that guy guys to enroll you into a </v>

2562
01:48:48.351 --> 01:48:53.351
<v Speaker 4>judo class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that I'm saying that I'm hearing </v>

2563
01:48:53.351 --> 01:48:53.890
<v Speaker 4>what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real hardships in childhood.</v>

2564
01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:01.400
<v Speaker 4>I saw my dad beat the fuck out of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>mother because she brought home </v>

2565
01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:01.400
<v Speaker 4>hamburger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you serious?</v>

2566
01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:06.550
<v Speaker 4>Beat the fuck out of her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that ever creep up in your foster </v>

2567
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:07.940
<v Speaker 4>with an open hand?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is Palm strike during the face?</v>

2568
01:49:08.210 --> 01:49:10.670
<v Speaker 4>Knocked her down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Blood was coming out of her nose.</v>

2569
01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:16.480
<v Speaker 4>Screamed at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or do you ever buy extra hamburger when </v>

2570
01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:19.361
<v Speaker 4>you're at the store?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it never stopped me from </v>

2571
01:49:19.361 --> 01:49:20.660
<v Speaker 4>enjoying the hamburgers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't allow it to.</v>

2572
01:49:20.661 --> 01:49:22.640
<v Speaker 4>I fought through it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's nothing.</v>

2573
01:49:22.930 --> 01:49:24.740
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just had a Douche bag for a dad.</v>

2574
01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:25.980
<v Speaker 4>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2575
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.220
<v Speaker 4>there's people that have had real shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened to them.</v>

2576
01:49:29.090 --> 01:49:34.090
<v Speaker 4>A few real things happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was nothing that got lit his pants </v>

2577
01:49:34.090 --> 01:49:35.270
<v Speaker 4>on fire a little posy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My Shit's not real.</v>

2578
01:49:35.271 --> 01:49:40.271
<v Speaker 4>Now that you tell your story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the worst thing,</v>

2579
01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:43.860
<v Speaker 4>you just need more dramatic shift in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your life to think about.</v>

2580
01:49:43.861 --> 01:49:46.470
<v Speaker 4>So you wouldn't think about little shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No lifting.</v>

2581
01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 4>Where a martial art</v>

2582
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:51.190
<v Speaker 1>comes into place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts is so difficult and so hard</v>

2583
01:49:51.191 --> 01:49:56.191
<v Speaker 1>to do and you get nervous before every </v>
<v Speaker 1>class that it literally allows you to </v>

2584
01:49:56.191 --> 01:49:58.000
<v Speaker 1>look at other things as like their </v>
<v Speaker 1>minor.</v>

2585
01:49:58.001 --> 01:50:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Now you control these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're nothing.</v>

2586
01:50:00.101 --> 01:50:02.050
<v Speaker 1>They're not that big a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of people,</v>

2587
01:50:02.051 --> 01:50:04.930
<v Speaker 1>they break a bone or something like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like a really traumatic thing.</v>

2588
01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had like a gang of surgeries </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

2589
01:50:07.061 --> 01:50:10.240
<v Speaker 1>I've had my nose fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both my knees fixed.</v>

2590
01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:12.100
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a lot of shit done,</v>

2591
01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:17.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because things are always breaking </v>

2592
01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:18.811
<v Speaker 1>because you're getting them Yankton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twisted and torked and but because you </v>

2593
01:50:18.811 --> 01:50:23.251
<v Speaker 1>get used to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a higher threshold for </v>

2594
01:50:23.251 --> 01:50:24.400
<v Speaker 1>uncomfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a higher threshold for,</v>

2595
01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:26.690
<v Speaker 1>for dealing with traumatic situation.</v>

2596
01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:29.100
<v Speaker 2>So you think ultimately if I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting into Jujitsu,</v>

2597
01:50:29.130 --> 01:50:31.100
<v Speaker 2>my fear of flying would disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2598
01:50:31.110 --> 01:50:34.710
<v Speaker 2>because I would be feeling fear of </v>
<v Speaker 2>flying is your fear of everything</v>

2599
01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:38.470
<v Speaker 1>got connected and your fear of getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>mounted by another man.</v>

2600
01:50:38.471 --> 01:50:41.200
<v Speaker 1>We tried to choke you unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get past that.</v>

2601
01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:46.201
<v Speaker 1>As you get past that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get better at this whole flying </v>

2602
01:50:46.201 --> 01:50:46.201
<v Speaker 1>thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I believe.</v>

2603
01:50:46.201 --> 01:50:50.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All martial arts are vehicles for your </v>

2604
01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:54.030
<v Speaker 1>human potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not trying to be a </v>

2605
01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:55.681
<v Speaker 1>professional fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to advance your human </v>

2606
01:50:55.681 --> 01:50:55.681
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2607
01:50:55.681 --> 01:50:55.681
<v Speaker 1>it's nice to have something to defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

2608
01:50:55.681 --> 01:51:00.631
<v Speaker 1>but just get rich and hires and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodyguards if that's all you're looking </v>

2609
01:51:00.631 --> 01:51:00.631
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2610
01:51:00.631 --> 01:51:04.960
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but per personal sovereignty for your </v>

2611
01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:06.610
<v Speaker 1>ability to be able to push your body to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain limit past that,</v>

2612
01:51:06.611 --> 01:51:09.610
<v Speaker 1>limit past the limit of what you thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were capable of,</v>

2613
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:11.800
<v Speaker 1>that's all shit as you chug</v>

2614
01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:17.140
<v Speaker 2>the capable of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you ever look at the ratio of </v>

2615
01:51:19.490 --> 01:51:22.610
<v Speaker 2>people that died in plane accidents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like car,</v>

2616
01:51:22.611 --> 01:51:27.611
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a fucking plan look ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that jump out of planes and die </v>

2617
01:51:27.611 --> 01:51:29.210
<v Speaker 2>is so uncomfortably I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2618
01:51:29.211 --> 01:51:34.211
<v Speaker 2>it's like 70 people a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only a few people like really </v>

2619
01:51:34.211 --> 01:51:35.290
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was fucking panic.</v>

2620
01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:37.460
<v Speaker 2>Did you get to touch Rachel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rachel Ray,</v>

2621
01:51:37.461 --> 01:51:42.461
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to touch her boobs on the way </v>

2622
01:51:42.461 --> 01:51:42.461
<v Speaker 2>down or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking freaked her out.</v>

2623
01:51:42.461 --> 01:51:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you died and at the moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>

2624
01:51:43.951 --> 01:51:48.951
<v Speaker 1>The moment you both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither one of your parachute's hit the </v>

2625

<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

2749
01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:47.110
<v Speaker 7>Wait tables where you start going out to</v>
<v Speaker 7>eat and go,</v>

<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2753
01:56:54.460 --> 01:56:58.120

<v Speaker 7>don't make as much money as you.</v>

2755
01:57:00.190 --> 01:57:02.080
<v Speaker 7>Do you feel obliged that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 7>pick up the tip,</v>

2756
01:57:02.170 --> 01:57:03.130
<v Speaker 7>the tab every time?</v>

2757
01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:06.450
<v Speaker 1>I do have most of the time because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way I say it is,</v>

2758
01:57:06.510 --> 01:57:09.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get into this who deserves it or</v>

2759
01:57:09.871 --> 01:57:14.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's is it fair or what is money to you</v>

2760
01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:15.420
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a dollar to you?</v>

2761
01:57:15.421 --> 01:57:17.030
<v Speaker 1>It was $5 to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2762
01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:21.450
<v Speaker 1>when I was doing like fear factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially money became very strange.</v>

2763
01:57:21.590 --> 01:57:26.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes very strange when you have a </v>

2764
01:57:26.590 --> 01:57:26.590
<v Speaker 1>lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2765
01:57:26.590 --> 01:57:29.720
<v Speaker 1>because then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you look if you pay $5 for </v>

2766
01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:29.720
<v Speaker 1>your meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to think,</v>

2767
01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:31.260
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I have 20 bucks left for the day.</v>

2768
01:57:31.890 --> 01:57:34.590
<v Speaker 1>If I'm paying $5 for a meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about it at all,</v>

2769
01:57:34.591 --> 01:57:37.260
<v Speaker 1>so let's just let me pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that way we don't have to think</v>

2770
01:57:37.261 --> 01:57:42.261
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like the best allocation of </v>

2771
01:57:42.261 --> 01:57:44.901
<v Speaker 1>resources is how I looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the way I looked at as like I'll </v>

2772
01:57:44.901 --> 01:57:46.710
<v Speaker 1>pay for the tab every time simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's easy for me to pay the tab.</v>

2773
01:57:46.711 --> 01:57:51.711
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't bother me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if there's $100 missing from my </v>

2774
01:57:51.711 --> 01:57:52.560
<v Speaker 1>account or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not gonna hurt me.</v>

2775
01:57:52.590 --> 01:57:54.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not gonna change the way I feel.</v>

2776
01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:55.610
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>

2777
01:57:55.611 --> 01:57:58.500
<v Speaker 7>it sucks being friends with joe is that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that gets to.</v>

2778
01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:01.220
<v Speaker 7>I mean the first in six months I knew </v>
<v Speaker 7>Joe,</v>

2779
01:58:01.221 --> 01:58:02.480
<v Speaker 7>I always felt like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

<v Speaker 7>here's $20.</v>

2781
01:58:03.411 --> 01:58:05.540
<v Speaker 7>But then I gave up on that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You just have to give up.</v>

2782
01:58:05.690 --> 01:58:08.360
<v Speaker 7>But then I'll find myself like feeling </v>
<v Speaker 7>bad about it,</v>

2783
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:10.400
<v Speaker 7>like all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it'd be like at starbucks?</v>

<v Speaker 7>it's just like you're always picking up </v>

2791
01:58:25.001 --> 01:58:27.191
<v Speaker 7>the bill.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It makes me almost not want to eat like </v>

2792
01:58:27.191 --> 01:58:29.500
<v Speaker 7>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like normally I would go to like a </v>

<v Speaker 7>Whatever the fuck you want to eat,</v>

2798
01:58:35.091 --> 01:58:37.550

<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2800
01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:44.090
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real strange when it becomes a like</v>

2801
01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:49.100
<v Speaker 1>a dividing thing between people and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can really easily where people don't </v>

2802
01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:52.921
<v Speaker 1>feel like you're doing your part or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're paying too much or I think </v>

2803
01:58:52.921 --> 01:58:56.521
<v Speaker 1>probably more fights between human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings or financial more than anything </v>

01:58:56.640 --> 01:58:58.720
<v Speaker 1>just excite you at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excite me.</v>

2805
01:58:59.110 --> 01:59:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I like having it because it takes care </v>
<v Speaker 1>of problems.</v>

2806
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:06.750
<v Speaker 1>The good thing about money is you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>need things or want things or you know,</v>

2807
01:59:07.690 --> 01:59:11.350
<v Speaker 1>want free time or money takes care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that shit.</v>

2808
01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:14.740
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have to fix your roof,</v>

2809
01:59:14.741 --> 01:59:16.720
<v Speaker 1>you got a hole in your roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

2810
01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Well when you have money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a matter of calling a roof guy</v>

2811
01:59:19.451 --> 01:59:20.920
<v Speaker 1>and having them come over and fix your </v>
<v Speaker 1>roof.</v>

2812
01:59:21.070 --> 01:59:26.070
<v Speaker 1>When you don't have money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes very stressful and it's a </v>

2813
01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:26.070
<v Speaker 1>fucking nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

2814
01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:26.560
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm barely paying my rent.</v>

2815
01:59:26.561 --> 01:59:29.140
<v Speaker 1>How am I going to come up with the extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>two grand to fix this roof?</v>

2816
01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:30.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a real issue.</v>

2817
01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:35.200
<v Speaker 1>I like having it because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not like,</v>

2818
01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:38.350
<v Speaker 1>not big on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a flashy person and I'm not.</v>

2819
01:59:38.351 --> 01:59:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I like cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about it,</v>

2820
01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:41.530
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2821
01:59:41.531 --> 01:59:46.531
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in a showy person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people get really addicted to like </v>

2822
01:59:46.531 --> 01:59:47.230
<v Speaker 1>keeping up with the Joneses and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes,</v>

2823
01:59:47.290 --> 01:59:48.610
<v Speaker 1>that becomes a real problem.</v>

2824

<v Speaker 2>not the family.</v>

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:10.230
<v Speaker 2>Douche bag guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys said it's good.</v>

2857
02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>And those lines like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a substitute for personnel.</v>

2858
02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:17.020
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if I was a chicken,</v>

2859
02:01:17.021 --> 02:01:18.220
<v Speaker 2>hate your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2860
02:01:18.221 --> 02:01:23.221
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of hot chicks were like rolling </v>

2861
02:01:23.221 --> 02:01:23.221
<v Speaker 2>up around us and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2862
02:01:23.221 --> 02:01:23.221
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

2863
02:01:23.221 --> 02:01:28.021
<v Speaker 2>and everyone's having a good time and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my head because I'm this fucking father </v>

2864
02:01:28.021 --> 02:01:31.210
<v Speaker 2>of two who's just sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear my brain go,</v>

2865
02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:34.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope someone recognizes us.</v>

2866
02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Like I hope I get recognized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like really?</v>

2867
02:01:36.851 --> 02:01:38.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I might in a weird way,</v>

2868
02:01:38.501 --> 02:01:42.000
<v Speaker 2>my ego's fucked up because I know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the girls for no,</v>

2869
02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:45.240
<v Speaker 1>so no one is banging you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going home alone.</v>

2870
02:01:45.250 --> 02:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>So like the only satisfaction you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of this is one of the girls </v>

2871
02:01:50.250 --> 02:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

2872
02:01:50.250 --> 02:01:53.060
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I catch myself doing that and I go,</v>

2873
02:01:53.061 --> 02:01:54.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that?</v>

2874
02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Did you ask them to listen to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast?</v>

2875
02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:01.220
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't understand a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm sitting there and heard the</v>

2876
02:02:01.221 --> 02:02:04.730
<v Speaker 2>machine and I'm watching and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything's going down and I go,</v>

2877
02:02:04.731 --> 02:02:06.860
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is unhealthy behavior right now.</v>

2878
02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:09.230
<v Speaker 2>What's going on is unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as soon as I said,</v>

2879
02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:11.780
<v Speaker 2>this girl comes up and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get a picture with you.</v>

2880
02:02:11.781 --> 02:02:12.890
<v Speaker 2>And then my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2881
02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:14.030
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm done,</v>

2882
02:02:14.031 --> 02:02:15.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to fuck anyone tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

2883
02:02:15.561 --> 02:02:16.790
<v Speaker 2>I got recognized like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2884
02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:17.890
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2885
02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:19.070
<v Speaker 2>but that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that is,</v>

2886
02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:20.270
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's addictive.</v>

2887
02:02:20.271 --> 02:02:21.080
<v Speaker 2>This shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2888
02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:26.900
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of getting recognized or being </v>

2889
02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:27.560
<v Speaker 2>acknowledged for your work is so self </v>
<v Speaker 2>gratifying.</v>

2890
02:02:27.770 --> 02:02:30.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like masturbating.</v>

2891
02:02:30.211 --> 02:02:34.340
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels good and it's shallow,</v>

2892
02:02:34.570 --> 02:02:35.930
<v Speaker 2>it's so fucking empty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shallow.</v>

2893
02:02:35.931 --> 02:02:40.430
<v Speaker 2>But in a weird way I can totally see how</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get fucked up on it.</v>

2894
02:02:40.650 --> 02:02:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2895
02:02:41.530 --> 02:02:45.340
<v Speaker 1>shallow and maybe what you do is get </v>
<v Speaker 1>pete,</v>

2896
02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:47.290
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a long time.</v>

2897
02:02:47.710 --> 02:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a normal thing for me to get </v>

2898
02:02:52.710 --> 02:02:55.771
<v Speaker 1>recognized for more than a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So since fear factor was to get,</v>

2899
02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2900
02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:05.550
<v Speaker 1>the way I always say it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bunch of people being nice to </v>

2901
02:03:05.550 --> 02:03:05.550
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

2902
02:03:05.550 --> 02:03:05.550
<v Speaker 1>People go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it ever get annoying?</v>

2903
02:03:05.550 --> 02:03:10.441
<v Speaker 1>Does it ever get tired?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a bunch of people being nice </v>

2904
02:03:10.441 --> 02:03:10.441
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cool.</v>

2905
02:03:10.441 --> 02:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's very important to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand where it was,</v>

2906
02:03:13.330 --> 02:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chain.</v>

2907
02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>It's addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels good.</v>

2908
02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>It's very important to like put it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>into perspective,</v>

2909
02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:23.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's good to be recognized for your </v>

2910
02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:23.820
<v Speaker 1>stuff and it's good to do good stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people like,</v>

2911
02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beautiful thing about seeing,</v>

2912
02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2913
02:03:26.330 --> 02:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>you run into someone out in public is </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time they're going to enjoy </v>

2914
02:03:31.330 --> 02:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>what you've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2915
02:03:31.330 --> 02:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>most of the time if someone comes up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2916
02:03:32.531 --> 02:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>it's like they appreciate what you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

2917
02:03:34.181 --> 02:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>And so you've given them something </v>
<v Speaker 1>already and you already,</v>

2918
02:03:36.450 --> 02:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you don't even know it,</v>

2919
02:03:38.890 --> 02:03:40.300
<v Speaker 1>you have a relationship with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like meeting meeting you,</v>

2983
02:05:57.490 --> 02:06:02.490
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to be around and do like Anthony </v>

2984
02:06:02.490 --> 02:06:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Bourdain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this is a different world.</v>

2985
02:06:02.490 --> 02:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy from the show</v>

2986
02:06:04.050 --> 02:06:07.700
<v Speaker 4>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lb side first world problems.</v>

2987
02:06:08.690 --> 02:06:11.660
<v Speaker 4>First world problems is when he talks </v>
<v Speaker 4>about veganism,</v>

2988
02:06:12.580 --> 02:06:16.090
<v Speaker 1>vegans and vegetarian and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a first world option,</v>

2989
02:06:16.150 --> 02:06:21.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I've always felt when </v>

2990
02:06:21.150 --> 02:06:21.150
<v Speaker 1>people would go off about vegetables and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2991
02:06:21.150 --> 02:06:22.510
<v Speaker 1>you need to be a vegan animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cruelty.</v>

2992
02:06:22.511 --> 02:06:25.150
<v Speaker 1>And I agree animal cruelty is fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't agree.</v>

2993
02:06:25.151 --> 02:06:30.151
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't kill animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go fuck yourself or what are </v>

2994
02:06:30.151 --> 02:06:30.550
<v Speaker 1>they going to live forever and cure </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer if they stay alive.</v>

2995
02:06:30.660 --> 02:06:32.530
<v Speaker 1>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And guess what?</v>

2996
02:06:32.531 --> 02:06:37.531
<v Speaker 1>They'd kill you too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit that would kill </v>

2997
02:06:37.531 --> 02:06:37.531
<v Speaker 1>you and maybe maybe me live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2998
02:06:37.531 --> 02:06:39.660
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>

2999
02:06:39.740 --> 02:06:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't hear very many people say </v>

3000
02:06:44.740 --> 02:06:46.951
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when bordain started saying that the </v>

3001
02:06:46.951 --> 02:06:46.951
<v Speaker 1>vegetarianism is a first world problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3002
02:06:46.951 --> 02:06:47.230
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

3003
02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:52.560
<v Speaker 1>So the people in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to kill things to sustain </v>

3004
02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:52.560
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Real.</v>

3005
02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:57.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like whether or not you choose </v>

3006
02:06:57.620 --> 02:06:58.390
<v Speaker 1>to not eat pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the only animal we have.</v>

3070
02:09:49.250 --> 02:09:52.771
<v Speaker 4>on whether it be generous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I just want it like I know </v>

<v Speaker 2>weight and so my dad gave me like six of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3099
02:11:08.830 --> 02:11:13.830
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give you the speed and then it's </v>

3100
02:11:13.830 --> 02:11:13.830
<v Speaker 2>not like a ton of speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like.</v>

3101
02:11:13.830 --> 02:11:18.770
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it definitely curbs your appetite and </v>

3102
02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:19.010
<v Speaker 2>definitely are on speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he gave me six.</v>

3106
02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:27.950
<v Speaker 2>So I took one and then the second I took</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3355
02:21:55.770 --> 02:21:58.370

3356
02:21:58.790 --> 02:22:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Married woman's hearing</v>

3360
02:22:15.700 --> 02:22:20.700
<v Speaker 3>Just a touch of Jalapeno in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Squirted into your mouth.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3363
02:22:26.980 --> 02:22:29.820
<v Speaker 4>My favorite podcast ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's my favorite.</v>

3364
02:22:29.900 --> 02:22:31.720
<v Speaker 4>I just want to do it sober one again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

3365
02:22:31.721 --> 02:22:32.330
<v Speaker 4>now listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can.</v>

3366
02:22:32.380 --> 02:22:37.380
<v Speaker 4>You just drank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The last one we did drunk was Doug </v>

3367
02:22:37.380 --> 02:22:37.380
<v Speaker 4>Stanhope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was like a great fucking.</v>

3368
02:22:37.380 --> 02:22:38.230
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you come back?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We needed that.</v>

3369
02:22:38.340 --> 02:22:41.580
<v Speaker 4>We love to man before he shoots himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3370
02:22:41.581 --> 02:22:45.420
<v Speaker 4>that's just the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doug's good.</v>

3371
02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:46.750
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's sad watching that.</v>

3372
02:22:47.250 --> 02:22:48.840
<v Speaker 4>Although if he kills himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3373
02:22:48.841 --> 02:22:53.841
<v Speaker 4>hunter s Thompson style,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he decides that his body's falling </v>

3374
02:22:53.841 --> 02:22:53.841
<v Speaker 4>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be surprised.</v>

3375
02:22:53.841 --> 02:22:55.560
<v Speaker 4>But I think that's probably a really </v>
<v Speaker 4>logical way to do it.</v>

3376
02:22:55.600 --> 02:22:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard his podcast with Tom </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhodes?</v>

3377
02:22:57.950 --> 02:23:01.060
<v Speaker 2>Here's a hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did a podcast with Tom Rhodes.</v>

3378
02:23:01.090 --> 02:23:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3379
02:23:01.930 --> 02:23:02.590
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3380
02:23:02.610 --> 02:23:05.020
<v Speaker 2>I just stumbled on it because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going through this,</v>

3381
02:23:05.050 --> 02:23:06.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Rhodes phase and I,</v>

3382
02:23:07.730 --> 02:23:09.610
<v Speaker 2>and I found it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3383
02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:13.210
<v Speaker 2>they date it is the most beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>ending of a podcast I've ever heard.</v>

3384
02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:18.750
<v Speaker 2>They talk about taking mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and then thinking the earth </v>

3385
02:23:18.750 --> 02:23:20.050
<v Speaker 2>who's going to spend them off and Tom </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhodes starts going,</v>

3386
02:23:20.051 --> 02:23:25.051
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this song was playing in the </v>

3387
02:23:25.051 --> 02:23:25.051
<v Speaker 2>background and Doug was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3388
02:23:25.051 --> 02:23:28.531
<v Speaker 2>and then I decided I didn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wherewithal to to get up and use the </v>

3389
02:23:28.531 --> 02:23:30.070
<v Speaker 2>restrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>urinated in my pants and Bingo.</v>

3390
02:23:30.071 --> 02:23:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Took my pants and change me and Tom </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhodes,</v>

3391
02:23:31.731 --> 02:23:33.730
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was one of those beautiful moments?</v>

3392
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:37.000
<v Speaker 2>And then they start singing together </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

3393
02:23:37.210 --> 02:23:42.210
<v Speaker 2>They start singing the song and it picks</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in the background and it's the most </v>

3394
02:23:42.340 --> 02:23:44.950
<v Speaker 2>awesome moment I've ever heard and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3395
02:23:44.951 --> 02:23:46.120
<v Speaker 2>it's so beautiful.</v>

3396
02:23:46.210 --> 02:23:51.210
<v Speaker 2>If you just go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you googled the podcast and you just </v>

3397
02:23:51.210 --> 02:23:54.070
<v Speaker 2>hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't listen to the whole thing because </v>

3398
02:23:54.070 --> 02:23:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Tom Roses sometimes Tom Rhodes sometime </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean I liked tom rose,</v>

3399
02:23:54.671 --> 02:23:56.320
<v Speaker 2>but like he tells doug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

3400
02:23:56.321 --> 02:23:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Doug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with the stand up?</v>

3401
02:23:57.431 --> 02:24:00.340
<v Speaker 2>And Doug's has been drinking again and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on an ambient in this podcast.</v>

3402
02:24:00.660 --> 02:24:02.580
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

3403
02:24:02.830 --> 02:24:04.510
<v Speaker 2>he's been drinking a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he says at the beginning,</v>

3404
02:24:04.511 --> 02:24:06.070
<v Speaker 2>don't miss anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying because I don't know what I'm</v>

3405
02:24:06.071 --> 02:24:11.071
<v Speaker 2>fucking saying tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Doug says he was dealt with </v>

3406
02:24:11.071 --> 02:24:11.071
<v Speaker 2>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug goes,</v>

3407
02:24:11.071 --> 02:24:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate it.</v>

3408
02:24:11.740 --> 02:24:14.200
<v Speaker 2>I've done everything I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just rewriting the same jokes.</v>

3409
02:24:14.201 --> 02:24:19.201
<v Speaker 2>I'm a shill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I could just quit this and fucking </v>

3410
02:24:19.201 --> 02:24:19.201
<v Speaker 2>never come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd do it tomorrow.</v>

3411
02:24:19.201 --> 02:24:21.780
<v Speaker 2>And then silent Tom goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what do you like about my standup?</v>

3412
02:24:30.610 --> 02:24:33.670
<v Speaker 4>It was a fake question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's clear that there,</v>

3413
02:24:33.671 --> 02:24:38.120
<v Speaker 4>but just so fucking hammered in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast and if you add that,</v>

3414
02:24:38.650 --> 02:24:41.900
<v Speaker 4>that's how we should end today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should all sing a song together about</v>

3415
02:24:42.070 --> 02:24:43.720
<v Speaker 4>my standup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the name of the song.</v>

3416
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Are you guys in key?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

3417
02:24:50.951 --> 02:24:55.951
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did mushrooms with Doug the day the </v>

3418

3419
02:24:55.951 --> 02:24:58.690

<v Speaker 4>We knew it was broken out,</v>

3420
02:24:58.691 --> 02:25:01.630
<v Speaker 4>so we decided to go out to the desert to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do drugs.</v>

3421
02:25:04.390 --> 02:25:06.640
<v Speaker 4>We went to a yawn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Irvin's house.</v>

3422
02:25:06.670 --> 02:25:09.180

<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3447
02:26:06.490 --> 02:26:11.490
<v Speaker 2>fucking different offerings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what you're saying about mushrooms </v>

3448
02:26:11.490 --> 02:26:11.970
<v Speaker 2>and you and hope that we did it,</v>

3449
02:26:12.090 --> 02:26:17.090
<v Speaker 1>data war broke out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We knew that the war with the United </v>

3450
02:26:17.090 --> 02:26:17.490
<v Speaker 1>States was going to war on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular day.</v>

3451
02:26:17.491 --> 02:26:20.520
<v Speaker 1>So we drove out to the desert with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude lived.</v>

3452
02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:24.240
<v Speaker 1>We got blitzkrieg on machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We took a couple different kinds.</v>

3453
02:26:24.510 --> 02:26:29.510
<v Speaker 1>We started out with the Amanita </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] area and then we moved our </v>

3454
02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:29.880
<v Speaker 1>way into psilocybe cubensis.</v>

3455
02:26:30.070 --> 02:26:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's different mushrooms.</v>

3456
02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3457
02:26:32.111 --> 02:26:34.390
<v Speaker 2>The ammunition and Endeca.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Endeca.</v>

3458
02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:36.130
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the ones that grow on a cow?</v>

3459
02:26:36.131 --> 02:26:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

3460
02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Those are [inaudible] cubensis </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>

3461
02:26:38.071 --> 02:26:39.870
<v Speaker 1>But there's different kinds of cubensis </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>

3462
02:26:39.871 --> 02:26:42.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different species of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic mushrooms,</v>

3463
02:26:42.031 --> 02:26:46.830
<v Speaker 1>including some that have no history or </v>
<v Speaker 1>known history of human use,</v>

3464
02:26:47.130 --> 02:26:52.130
<v Speaker 1>their psychedelic chemicals that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't even believe that people </v>

3465
02:26:52.130 --> 02:26:54.670
<v Speaker 1>discovered like a Hawaiian baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woodrow.</v>

3466
02:26:54.780 --> 02:26:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

3467
02:26:55.771 --> 02:27:00.771
<v Speaker 1>I believe there's no evidence of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>use of that until I really recently.</v>

3468
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:05.250
<v Speaker 1>And it contains the same chemical </v>
<v Speaker 1>compounds as Lsd,</v>

3469
02:27:05.790 --> 02:27:06.810
<v Speaker 1>a believer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3470
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:07.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3471
02:27:07.221 --> 02:27:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm might be a little off on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lysergic acid.</v>

3472
02:27:09.571 --> 02:27:11.340
<v Speaker 1>I know it's something to do with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there,</v>

3473
02:27:11.341 --> 02:27:14.040
<v Speaker 1>but either way it's a very strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic compound,</v>

3474
02:27:14.310 --> 02:27:16.470
<v Speaker 1>but there's almost no history of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>

3475
02:27:16.710 --> 02:27:19.860
<v Speaker 1>so it was like one of those weird things</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people might have missed that one,</v>

3476
02:27:19.910 --> 02:27:21.410
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3477
02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I can't do psychedelics anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3478
02:27:26.100 --> 02:27:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Why do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I know my brain the last time I </v>

3479
02:27:31.100 --> 02:27:33.830
<v Speaker 1>keep saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let me tell you something that </v>

3480
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:35.720
<v Speaker 1>anybody tells me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know my brain is the number one </v>

3481
02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:39.351
<v Speaker 1>candidate for a psychedelic experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you say that you can't do </v>

3482
02:27:39.351 --> 02:27:39.570
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know your brain.</v>

3483
02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:44.600
<v Speaker 1>What I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I hear is my ego has tricked me </v>

3484
02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:47.481
<v Speaker 1>into this position who are have stood my</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground and I'm terrified of anything </v>

3485
02:27:47.481 --> 02:27:48.600
<v Speaker 1>really truly frightening and </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary,</v>

3486
02:27:48.780 --> 02:27:52.020
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to operate by clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>defined,</v>

3487
02:27:52.021 --> 02:27:57.021
<v Speaker 1>predetermined pattern of behavior that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>find acceptable and I'm going to stick </v>

3488
02:27:57.021 --> 02:27:58.470
<v Speaker 1>to that whenever anybody brings it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then everybody brings it up.</v>

3489
02:27:58.471 --> 02:27:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3490
02:27:59.131 --> 02:28:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I know my brain,</v>

3491
02:28:00.350 --> 02:28:02.790
<v Speaker 2>and the last time you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did it before a show.</v>

3492
02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:08.480
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do shrooms in the show and </v>

3493
02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:10.151
<v Speaker 2>didn't get work on a show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was watching shadow people in the </v>

3494
02:28:10.151 --> 02:28:10.360
<v Speaker 2>crowds and he's scared of shadow people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time we shrooms,</v>

3495
02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:11.650
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

3496
02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:12.440
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I could,</v>

3497
02:28:12.470 --> 02:28:17.470
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could theoretically eat mushrooms if </v>

3498
02:28:17.470 --> 02:28:17.470
<v Speaker 2>it was the right moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The right time.</v>

3499
02:28:17.470 --> 02:28:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Could 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3500
02:28:18.110 --> 02:28:20.670
<v Speaker 2>but it would definitely need to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the day,</v>

3501
02:28:20.850 --> 02:28:23.510
<v Speaker 2>like couldn't do it at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never been able to do it at night.</v>

3502
02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Heightened states of tension that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate.</v>

3503
02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:28.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's understandable if you're at war,</v>

3504
02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:29.760
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3505
02:28:29.761 --> 02:28:32.340
<v Speaker 1>you're hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering your fucking chasing a deer,</v>

3506
02:28:32.610 --> 02:28:36.720
<v Speaker 1>but heightened stakes for no reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you seem to acquire.</v>

3507
02:28:36.810 --> 02:28:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to deal with them.</v>

3508
02:28:38.790 --> 02:28:43.790
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the natural balance of a </v>

3509
02:28:43.790 --> 02:28:46.731
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Genetically we have the same DNA as </v>

3510
02:28:46.731 --> 02:28:50.990
<v Speaker 1>fucking people that live 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago that were throwing pointed </v>

3511
02:28:50.990 --> 02:28:53.010
<v Speaker 1>sticks at running animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the same Goddamn DNA yet we have</v>

3512
02:28:53.011 --> 02:28:56.370
<v Speaker 1>these bodies that we don't exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't push them,</v>

3513
02:28:56.520 --> 02:28:59.880
<v Speaker 1>we don't make them do things and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a great deal of,</v>

3514
02:28:59.881 --> 02:29:04.881
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of human tension and stress and and and </v>

3515
02:29:04.881 --> 02:29:06.960
<v Speaker 1>imbalanced that comes from not taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>care of your body,</v>

3516
02:29:07.260 --> 02:29:12.260
<v Speaker 1>that your body misfires and sends </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical signals that don't make sense </v>

3517
02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:17.001
<v Speaker 1>and it's confused and doesn't know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to handle itself and it's insecure and </v>

3518
02:29:17.001 --> 02:29:18.150
<v Speaker 1>it's fucked up and it's weird because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand it.</v>

3519
02:29:18.151 --> 02:29:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that makes your body.</v>

3520
02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Did it fucks with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it deceives you,</v>

3521
02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:26.700
<v Speaker 1>it throws you bad signal.</v>

3522
02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:31.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid I'm afraid because when like </v>
<v Speaker 2>my brain already fires by itself,</v>

3523
02:29:31.700 --> 02:29:34.430
<v Speaker 2>like it just starts saying things and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we're comedy.</v>

3524
02:29:34.460 --> 02:29:38.540
<v Speaker 2>My comedy comes from at least and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid when like now I get to a point,</v>

3525
02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:43.560
<v Speaker 2>this is where I was last time is we took</v>
<v Speaker 2>some mushrooms and I realized that the </v>

3526
02:29:43.881 --> 02:29:47.600
<v Speaker 2>second I took them that I'm a father and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3527
02:29:47.630 --> 02:29:52.630
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get off the grid the way I did </v>

3528
02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:52.630
<v Speaker 2>in college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't just hop off the grid,</v>

3529
02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:57.550
<v Speaker 2>disappeared for six hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a fun adventure down the itch and </v>

3530
02:29:57.550 --> 02:30:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Tuck me like I'm a father who's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>with not only my livelihood but the </v>

3531
02:30:01.911 --> 02:30:06.911
<v Speaker 2>livelihood of my children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I do pull a trigger in my head </v>

3532
02:30:06.911 --> 02:30:08.990
<v Speaker 2>and I can't come back if something fucks</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in my head,</v>

3533
02:30:09.290 --> 02:30:11.070
<v Speaker 2>I have now ruined life for too long and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3534
02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:13.490
<v Speaker 2>that thought is what fucked me up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the night.</v>

3535
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:18.910
<v Speaker 2>And then one of my buddies like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking just get as drunk as you </v>

3536
02:30:18.910 --> 02:30:18.910
<v Speaker 2>possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3537
02:30:18.910 --> 02:30:18.910
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we'll do.</v>

3538
02:30:18.910 --> 02:30:19.340
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that.</v>

3539
02:30:19.341 --> 02:30:24.341
<v Speaker 2>And it was a fun night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a great night after that when I </v>

3540
02:30:24.341 --> 02:30:24.341
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

3541
02:30:24.341 --> 02:30:24.530
<v Speaker 2>I'll just keep drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my biggest.</v>

3542
02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:26.270
<v Speaker 2>That's my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where my head.</v>

3543
02:30:26.430 --> 02:30:28.310
<v Speaker 2>It lives when it comes to psychedelics,</v>

3544
02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:31.470
<v Speaker 1>will you talk to the wrong dude?</v>

02:34:53.681 --> 02:34:58.681

<v Speaker 1>components and ingredients that all put </v>

3655
02:34:59.111 --> 02:35:04.030
<v Speaker 1>together to make everything including </v>
<v Speaker 1>society and human beings and people have</v>

3656
02:35:04.031 --> 02:35:09.031
<v Speaker 1>to be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be different kinds of </v>

3657
02:35:09.031 --> 02:35:10.891
<v Speaker 1>people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and too much society wants to take </v>

3658
02:35:10.891 --> 02:35:12.650
<v Speaker 1>people that really don't have problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just.</v>

3659
02:35:12.730 --> 02:35:17.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody has problems but </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just fucking different and </v>

3660
02:35:17.730 --> 02:35:20.140
