00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you get blood work done?</v>

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.490
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have uh,</v>

4
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.750
<v Speaker 2>I've got prescription to like measure</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all,</v>

5
00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:15.010
<v Speaker 2>like my nutrient levels and I've just</v>
<v Speaker 2>been too lazy to go get it done.</v>

6
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.990
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a professional at the highest</v>

7
00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:23.290
<v Speaker 2>level of the game and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an idiot.</v>

8
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

9
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a procrastinator with it because you</v>

10
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:30.070
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day I'll,</v>

11
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll feel like crappy and I'll be</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to my osteopath.</v>

12
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.900
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like go get these blood work</v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

13
00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:39.901
<v Speaker 2>see what your deficiencies are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we will get a prescription and I'll</v>

14
00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:41.560
<v Speaker 2>never go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared of needles.</v>

15
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're scared of needles.</v>

16
00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:45.460
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pass out.</v>

17
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm not joking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not scared to fight in a cage many</v>

18
00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:56.530
<v Speaker 2>times doing ivs or stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man,</v>

19
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.640
<v Speaker 2>I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sold like when you're rehydrating like</v>

20
00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:05.240
<v Speaker 2>when they give you an ivy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pass out and faint and then I will</v>

21
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:09.730
<v Speaker 2>wake up and everyone's looking at almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacked for us and a couple of guys</v>

22
00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:12.760
<v Speaker 2>because I woke up and didn't know where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was and I was just like,</v>

23
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.010
<v Speaker 2>that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>sucks.</v>

24
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.130
<v Speaker 1>I used to date this girl who couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even watch someone get a needle in a</v>

25
00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:22.270
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would black out.</v>

26
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:27.520
<v Speaker 2>If I think about it too hard then I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>let get my stomach will like,</v>

28
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 2>that's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.290
<v Speaker 2>But that's the only logical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand what that is and it</v>

30
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:36.260
<v Speaker 2>only happened like it only started</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening like four or five years ago.</v>

31
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.740
<v Speaker 2>Reward like blood because you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get blood work done for the fights,</v>

32
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.470
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Past your HIV and all that stuff.</v>

33
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.330
<v Speaker 2>And before I would just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

34
00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:46.790
<v Speaker 2>and it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walk away now.</v>

35
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.320
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden out of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I see a needle coming my way,</v>

36
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:56.321
<v Speaker 2>I see my face will get white and for no</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason that's so strange.</v>

37
00:01:57.411 --> 00:01:58.970
<v Speaker 2>So I have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get on my phone like this,</v>

38
00:01:58.971 --> 00:02:02.780
<v Speaker 2>I have to lay down like it's a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>host of look away and look.</v>

39
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Distract myself.</v>

40
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even talking about right now,</v>

41
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.910
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get like a.</v>

42
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.730
<v Speaker 1>that's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>

43
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 1>it would make more sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something you always had.</v>

44
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>

45
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Like my ex girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her dad had it and she said that her dad</v>

46
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:19.970
<v Speaker 1>one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

47
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 1>her brother got like a severe sunburn</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the blisters all over him and the</v>

48
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Dad saw it and the dad fainted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's crazy is that dad was a</v>

49
00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:29.800
<v Speaker 1>fucking doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

50
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.340
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a dentist.</v>

51
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.040
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck is this guy like me?</v>

52
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you must deal with some fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up shit and gory things.</v>

53
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Stills in dentistry too weird.</v>

54
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he was okay with needles,</v>

55
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.460
<v Speaker 1>but he would see certain things like he</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw his son with blisters from</v>

56
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 1>listers</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

57
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>like from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the sun,</v>

58
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 1>from sunburn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he apparently had a really bad</v>

59
00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:00.170
<v Speaker 1>sunburn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

60
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

61
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in her family.</v>

62
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's weird that you acquired it.</v>

63
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 1>That's virtually nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like one,</v>

64
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.280
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing blood work for uh,</v>

65
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>a fight and I was at the hospital and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just like everyday and then I</v>

66
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:17.130
<v Speaker 1>passed out and ever since then it</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

67
00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:19.190
<v Speaker 1>So I have to be really careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

68
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>but this guy goes around and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>records people.</v>

69
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Regular people walks up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>records you and puts it online and</v>

70
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He edits it together and puts it on</v>

71
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

72
00:03:31.161 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Kinda fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up.</v>

73
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>That's very fucked up is he agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't know who.</v>

74
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>We know who the guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no idea.</v>

75
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>So he doesn't put himself on ever fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy.</v>

76
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>So he walks up to people and gets a</v>
<v Speaker 1>various responses.</v>

77
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Some people like he walks up to chew all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>

78
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Got pulled off youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's on La live leak now.</v>

79
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.310
<v Speaker 1>He walks up to two mormons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that go door to door and</v>

80
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>they're super polite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

81
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

82
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're recording us.</v>

83
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a nice conversation and they</v>

84
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>walk off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then other people,</v>

85
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:08.020
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to knock them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's so.</v>

86
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.080
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting how</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera in and of itself almost has</v>

87
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 1>this social view of of like like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>weapon in a way.</v>

88
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're pointing that thing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>me because you're attempting to take.</v>

89
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>The person's not doing anything wrong by</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing the thing.</v>

90
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.411
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

91
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the person that's getting</v>

92
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 1>recorded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing anything wrong.</v>

93
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Why does it make us feel so</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable?</v>

94
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>You're opening up a door for a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people to enter into your life.</v>

95
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>If you take a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll got back.</v>

96
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I took a camera on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know you.</v>

97
00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 1>I find you take a camera and then I put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it on the youtube channel that has a</v>

98
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.880
<v Speaker 1>million subscribers like yours does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

99
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:45.130
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

100
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the person doesn't know that</v>

101
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:49.300
<v Speaker 1>when they're being recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

102
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.280
<v Speaker 1>That right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're out in the street,</v>

103
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 1>probably doesn't count for you because</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody might know who you are and what</v>

104
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a regular everyday person</v>

105
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:01.000
<v Speaker 1>and someone walks up to you with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>smartphone and they're just a few feet</v>

106
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>away from you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recording you that like that's what he's</v>

107
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

108
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.180
<v Speaker 1>He's not announcing that it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be on youtube,</v>

109
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.450
<v Speaker 1>but people's reactions are intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't be phone still is fun and kick</v>

110
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:14.760

<v Speaker 1>Because I stole his phone.</v>

113
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's because that's a way</v>

114
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:23.080
<v Speaker 1>better clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't get it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>get his phone.</v>

117
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you may,</v>

118
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 1>you may be more gifted than others who</v>
<v Speaker 1>fail in his clips to get it from him.</v>

119
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Like a sprinter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While he's,</v>

120
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he starts to get he.</v>

121
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 1>He moves away at the right time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's crazy.</v>

122
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 1>He interrupts like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

124
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.670
<v Speaker 1>There are cases where he walks behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cash register at Mcdonald's and</v>

125
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:49.720
<v Speaker 1>starts recording people that are making</v>
<v Speaker 1>burgers and they're just like,</v>

126
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or in certain cases,</v>

127
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:53.820
<v Speaker 1>like he don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he walks,</v>

128
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.780
<v Speaker 1>he walks into like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

129
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>a card game that's going on private card</v>
<v Speaker 1>game and he's recording it like he takes</v>

130
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>risks to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get that footage.</v>

131
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>But I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that guy.</v>

132
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it sort of unveils something</v>

133
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>about humanity and how we're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely ready for a fully recorded</v>

134
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
