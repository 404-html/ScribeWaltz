<v Speaker 1>Amy Young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy,</v>

2
00:00:01.231 --> 00:00:05.820
<v Speaker 1>fix this fucking mess we have here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Electronics fail folks.</v>

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they judge do sometimes they just go bad</v>

4
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:10.130
<v Speaker 1>on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just feel,</v>

5
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.530
<v Speaker 1>that's why people like mechanical shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cars with a collage,</v>

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>they fail to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fail to.</v>

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>He did three boards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three boards.</v>

8
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Young Jamie had a fire through a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of shit we have laying around.</v>

9
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Luckily we almost have enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're listening to this,</v>

10
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is in mono.</v>

11
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not even in Stereo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

12
00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Stairs like mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to sound like shit.</v>

13
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Well you're in like one ear only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

14
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I can only get us to one from what I own</v>
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>

15
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 1>How do you sound to the regular people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fix it later.</v>

16
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:43.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be just fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for right now I'm only going to be</v>

17
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>left here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

18
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>if anybody's listening to the youtube on</v>
<v Speaker 1>headphones,</v>

19
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>that means you're probably at work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking off.</v>

20
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely not working.</v>

21
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how many people listen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts while they're working and don't</v>

22
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>really work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how many people messaged me</v>

23
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 1>about how they're doing something pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and they're sitting there like</v>

24
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing fork lifts and moving shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

25
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.140
<v Speaker 1>but I'm laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>

26
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Really comforting man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at least they're,</v>

27
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 1>well if you work at forklift you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to listen to people.</v>

28
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess not have those headsets on it</v>

29
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>and we'll have a good laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of them say they have a</v>

30
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 1>policies where someone will tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey one ear free,</v>

31
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you can hear someone screaming</v>

32
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>my legs under this thing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

33
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:31.740
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the rule when you drive him?</v>

34
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not allowed to have like</v>
<v Speaker 1>full headsets on as supposed to yeah.</v>

35
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.170
<v Speaker 1>You can have one in I guess you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely,</v>

36
00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legally drive.</v>

37
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legally I'm guessing.</v>

38
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.890
<v Speaker 1>What am I a lawyer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

39
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a great lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

40
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>That would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would fucking argue to the end.</v>

41
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>I think if you became a lawyer and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were arguing all the time,</v>

42
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:51.840
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably be a nightmare to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

43
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Cause you probably always trying to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh for sure.</v>

44
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

46
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.590
<v Speaker 1>is what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find their way out of technicalities.</v>

47
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>You're a shrink too and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every conversation you get in,</v>

49
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:05.520
<v Speaker 1>are you psychoanalyzing everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>

50
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

51
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's got to wear out on you other</v>

52
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>people for Awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like will you knock it the fuck off?</v>

53
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well when I was in college that was the</v>

54
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never really applied myself at</v>

55
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:17.610
<v Speaker 1>college at all.</v>

56
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>But the one thing that I was thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

57
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:21.030
<v Speaker 1>like if I had a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

58
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>what are things that I'm interested in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychology did come up because I'd read</v>

59
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>a lot of like self help books and</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology books while I was fighting to</v>

60
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>try to like manage my mind and anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit like that.</v>

61
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>But then I thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

62
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>you just be dealing with people with</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems all the time and you don't,</v>

63
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

64
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just make you dicks off.</v>

65
00:02:47.111 --> 00:02:48.640
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone tells you their problems.</v>

67
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like if you tell me your</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

68
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>you're making my Dick's off problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>make you dig stuff.</v>

69
00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:57.700
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

70
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 2>I always felt like that when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>dating.</v>

71
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:02.490
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

72
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.510
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the girl,</v>

74
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making that ticks off.</v>

75
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depends on what the problems are.</v>

76
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.610
<v Speaker 2>The problems are they ex boyfriend?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just never wanted to eat my pussy.</v>

77
00:03:11.611 --> 00:03:13.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good problem.</v>

78
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes it the car,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Problems,</v>

81
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.820

<v Speaker 2>I've never heard that before.</v>

82
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now</v>

83
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.470
<v Speaker 2>that's an original problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make my Dick Stop.</v>

84
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 2>You should make a song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've written a few lyrics.</v>

85
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.470
<v Speaker 2>I really have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it wrap or the way that I had</v>

86
00:03:39.471 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 2>it written out is that it's one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>songs that starts with banter between</v>

87
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 2>like the piano player and the guy on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mic and he's like,</v>

88
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:48.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

89
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 2>hey joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how'd it go last night?</v>

90
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

91
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.620
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

92
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 2>she came over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know there's nothing I hate.</v>

93
00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate more than proud was right.</v>

94
00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Aww.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man.</v>

95
00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Then you hear a little sprinkle of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>piano,</v>

96
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 2>you'll problems make my dick so dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that can actually be a funny song.</v>

97
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

98
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.851
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

99
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 2>You seen the team up with somebody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

100
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a sure sign that someone is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really into turning you on.</v>

101
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get together with you and then just</v>

102
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 2>start whining and complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

103
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Get your freak on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if it's early on and you're</v>

104
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 2>wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

105
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where we stand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they start,</v>

106
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.750
<v Speaker 2>if it's a girl is downloading the</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>

107
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.450
<v Speaker 2>she's not interested in that deck at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>or she's just so into herself that you</v>

108
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 2>just got to get out of there anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

109
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Time to bail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

110
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Because when you tell someone about your</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>

111
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.400
<v Speaker 2>aren't you thinking while you're telling</v>
<v Speaker 2>them like,</v>

112
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fucking burden this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my problems.</v>

113
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

114
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 2>So when someone doesn't think like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very self obsessed.</v>

115
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.310
<v Speaker 2>That's just thinking about themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

116
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.590
<v Speaker 2>And I told her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can fuck you.</v>

117
00:04:54.591 --> 00:04:57.140
<v Speaker 2>You fucking,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

137
00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:49.720
<v Speaker 2>then you're in the fight world and you</v>

<v Speaker 2>people talking about things that</v>

140
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:53.350
<v Speaker 2>interest you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

141
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.770
<v Speaker 2>And if you go on a double date with</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who doesn't check off any of</v>

142
00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 2>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be real</v>

143
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 4>fucking downer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people just don't know how to tell</v>

144
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 4>a fucking story either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

145
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We went on this one double date and this</v>

146
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Speaker 4>dude started telling me this story about</v>
<v Speaker 4>his son and his son's basketball game.</v>

147
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.170
<v Speaker 4>And I swear to God there was fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

148
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 4>There was nothing there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

149
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 4>usually gets a few minutes and then the</v>
<v Speaker 4>coach apparently wanted him to do dance,</v>

150
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 4>but he wanted to do that and trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not getting enough time on the</v>

151
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:32.081
<v Speaker 4>court and it's droning on and on and on</v>
<v Speaker 4>and on and on.</v>

152
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 4>And the guy's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

153
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 4>no sense of someone listening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no sense.</v>

154
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.750
<v Speaker 4>There's no interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like he's decided that he has</v>

155
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 4>a story that he likes to tell and he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to go on with this story and he's</v>

156
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 4>using his hands and he's bending his</v>
<v Speaker 4>head forward.</v>

157
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:51.590
<v Speaker 4>He's got all this crazy movement and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing there.</v>

158
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 4>Just like the cause.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably cause that story works in his</v>

159
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 4>dad's circle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

160
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:59.810
<v Speaker 4>with his other dad friends that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are dads on that team.</v>

161
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

162
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 4>they have kids on that team and he tells</v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

163
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 4>can you believe when the coach and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>other dads are like,</v>

164
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

165
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.400
<v Speaker 4>I saw the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he usually scores so he thinks he</v>

166
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 4>leaves that going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good story.</v>

167
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.720
<v Speaker 4>I think some people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

168
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 4>that one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't care.</v>

169
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.400
<v Speaker 4>They just wait for their time to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people they talk and then you talk</v>

170
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:21.990
<v Speaker 4>and then they talk in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone they know is boring and</v>

171
00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:25.430
<v Speaker 4>they just can't wait to go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's their life.</v>

172
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.820
<v Speaker 4>They fucking take sleeping pills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know how many people I've run</v>

173
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 4>into that fucking takes sleeping pills</v>
<v Speaker 4>every night?</v>

174
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.240
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

175
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.320
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot.</v>

176
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.840
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the things that I do.</v>

177
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.090
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ask what you know,</v>

178
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:43.150
<v Speaker 4>I did this bit on Ari Shaffir show about</v>
<v Speaker 4>a house fire or a fire in a hotel that I</v>

179
00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:45.860
<v Speaker 4>was in with Thompson girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right,</v>

180
00:07:45.861 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a Joey Diaz remember that fight</v>

181
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tell us not to take the elevator.</v>

182
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 4>We get stuck in the stay with a host</v>
<v Speaker 4>point of the story is I was ready to</v>

183
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:58.580
<v Speaker 4>fucking stampede these people cause they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were slowly walking down the stairs and</v>

184
00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:00.170
<v Speaker 4>we got outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were looking for Joey,</v>

185
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:02.570
<v Speaker 4>we were panicking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joey comes outside and they'd go,</v>

186
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:03.291
<v Speaker 4>where were you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

187
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:08.291
<v Speaker 4>I took the elevator like a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was smoking a joint outsider and he's</v>

188
00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:11.570
<v Speaker 4>smoking a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the greatest.</v>

189
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 4>But I realized while I was doing this</v>
<v Speaker 4>that some of these people were literally</v>

190
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:18.890
<v Speaker 4>waking up while they were walking.</v>

191
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 4>And then I started thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many of these fucks are on sleeping</v>

192
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:24.290
<v Speaker 4>pills?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I knew Kevin James,</v>

193
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.340
<v Speaker 4>Kevin James would take sleeping pills</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he would do shit.</v>

194
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.090
<v Speaker 4>Like he made dinner once and he just</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't want to admit that he made dinner</v>

195
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.940
<v Speaker 4>like you think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he went to the store and bought</v>

196
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:39.350
<v Speaker 4>a Turkey or something crazy like that</v>
<v Speaker 4>and cooked it and went,</v>

197
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.360
<v Speaker 4>got up in the morning and didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>admit he did it.</v>

198
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:41.790
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

199
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:43.850
<v Speaker 4>I didn't fucking do that because he</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't remember it.</v>

200
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:46.210
<v Speaker 4>Didn't remember it at all cause it</v>
<v Speaker 4>warped him that much.</v>

201
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.850
<v Speaker 4>Remember Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just do things that don't never</v>

202
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 4>taken one scary dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They scare the shit out of me when I'm</v>

203
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 4>not tired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I stay awake.</v>

204
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

205
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.210
<v Speaker 4>How fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

206
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.260

<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

207
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.470

<v Speaker 4>So I started getting into pain,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Tons of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

221

<v Speaker 4>It seems like the key to that.</v>

225

<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

228
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:55.200
<v Speaker 4>that you're not actually getting the</v>
<v Speaker 4>benefit of real sleep on that yet.</v>

229
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.790
<v Speaker 4>You're shutting something down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're not actually dipping into</v>

230
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.780
<v Speaker 4>real rem sleep and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

00:10:02.781 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 4>and getting all the benefits to your</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain that you're almost like getting</v>

232
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:07.470
<v Speaker 4>knocked out unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

233
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.260
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you get fucked up like Michael</v>

234
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.093
<v Speaker 4>Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

235
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he went as deep as you get.</v>

236
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.320
<v Speaker 4>He was taking that fucking stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they used to put people under</v>

237
00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:19.380
<v Speaker 4>anesthesia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's getting hit anesthetized.</v>

238
00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:22.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He imagined that every night a doctor's</v>

239
00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:24.350
<v Speaker 4>administering that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

240
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.700
<v Speaker 4>through a mass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>K Are we removing your gallbladder?</v>

241
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.690
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to take a nap.</v>

242
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.370
<v Speaker 4>So just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just like this thing.</v>

243
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.710
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well he was probably so fucked up.</v>

244
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw Dick Gregory talking about him and</v>

245
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.500
<v Speaker 4>it was really interesting because Dick</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gregory was getting interviewed by this</v>

246
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 4>guy and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy was talking to him about Michael</v>

247
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 4>Jackson and Dick Gregory just started</v>
<v Speaker 4>going off and he,</v>

248
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:46.380
<v Speaker 4>and he started screaming.</v>

249
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.890
<v Speaker 4>He never had a fucking child.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you understand me?</v>

250
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.990
<v Speaker 4>He never had a fucking childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He never bounced a ball and he's just</v>

251
00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:57.330
<v Speaker 4>started going off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause I guess he knew Michael Jackson</v>

252
00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.200
<v Speaker 4>and was just saying he missed that part</v>
<v Speaker 4>of his childhood.</v>

253
00:11:01.201 --> 00:11:04.530
<v Speaker 4>Like the whole Neverland thing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>hanging out with children.</v>

254
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.860
<v Speaker 4>A big part of that was just that he</v>
<v Speaker 4>never had a childhood.</v>

255
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.020
<v Speaker 4>I think that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does make sense.</v>

256
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he ever did anything to</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody.</v>

257
00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:14.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't know cause I wasn't there</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously.</v>

258
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.570
<v Speaker 4>But I think a lot of the people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's hanging around with,</v>

259
00:11:18.571 --> 00:11:23.220
<v Speaker 4>those little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their parents realize like this is a</v>

260
00:11:23.221 --> 00:11:26.400
<v Speaker 4>fucking golden ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if he never did anything,</v>

261
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.580
<v Speaker 4>they realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a guy.</v>

262
00:11:29.581 --> 00:11:32.160
<v Speaker 4>My kids spend the night over this</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking crazy.</v>

263
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.400
<v Speaker 4>Multi-Multi multimillionaire's house</v>
<v Speaker 4>hoes up fucking backyard filled with</v>

264
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.830
<v Speaker 4>amusement park rides,</v>
<v Speaker 4>toys in his house,</v>

265
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.820
<v Speaker 4>like monkeys and zebras and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

266
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.300
<v Speaker 4>If he's not a pedophile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

267
00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:47.940
<v Speaker 4>like there's something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking let's sue this guy.</v>

268
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:48.774
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

269
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.190
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

270
00:11:50.191 --> 00:11:52.890
<v Speaker 4>That he's a sad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a sad story when you think about,</v>

271
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.213
<v Speaker 4>I mean</v>

272
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:59.050
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty well documented that that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't very pleasant to be a Joe Jackson</v>

273
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

274
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.590
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That had to be a fucking disaster.</v>

275
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that'd be a goddamn nightmare.</v>

276
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you sound like a crazy guy.</v>

277
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.880
<v Speaker 1>That's how you get good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having a dad make you do that dance one</v>

278
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:13.870
<v Speaker 1>more time I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's pretty,</v>

279
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 1>is that the only way I wonder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

280
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Probably the only way to get that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

281
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.660
<v Speaker 1>I do think with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

282
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.350
<v Speaker 1>with athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

283
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.640
<v Speaker 1>I've read a lot of stories about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>dads affect certain athletes,</v>

284
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.470
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

285
00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:33.940
<v Speaker 1>but there's the other side of it that</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them just have that focus and</v>

286
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:36.460
<v Speaker 1>that desire themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of them say,</v>

287
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.020
<v Speaker 1>the only way you get this good and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>in you,</v>

288
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.980
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be the one that wakes up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes on the run and trains and that's</v>

289
00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:45.910
<v Speaker 1>how you get it.</v>

290
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:49.210
<v Speaker 1>But there's the flip side of that is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>

291
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overbearing dad that I'm going to</v>

292
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:54.970
<v Speaker 1>make you a champion or you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times it was overbearing.</v>

293
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Dad's kid winds up rebelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

294
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.910
<v Speaker 1>They wind up just abandoning that dad</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they never want to have anything to</v>

295
00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:04.720
<v Speaker 1>do with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure todd Marinovich and Mark</v>

296
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Marinovich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that's that whole story.</v>

297
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

298
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.100
<v Speaker 1>His Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marvin Marinovich was this like</v>

299
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.140
<v Speaker 1>legendary strength and conditioning</v>
<v Speaker 1>coach.</v>

300
00:13:11.141 --> 00:13:16.141
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy I worked with Bj Penn when Bj</v>
<v Speaker 1>Penn was in his prime and he just has</v>

301
00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:21.160
<v Speaker 1>these crazy really revolutionary ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to strength and</v>

302
00:13:21.161 --> 00:13:24.550
<v Speaker 1>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had his son on this insane</v>

303
00:13:24.551 --> 00:13:28.660
<v Speaker 1>organic diet and I don't think he views</v>
<v Speaker 1>even feeding them meat when he was young</v>

304
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.500
<v Speaker 1>and it was at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a,</v>

305
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.200
<v Speaker 1>this was 24 seven it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to,</v>

306
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.210
<v Speaker 1>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a meal plan.</v>

307
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Hope you stick to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stretching him,</v>

308
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.130
<v Speaker 1>feeding baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>

309
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.450
<v Speaker 1>We're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>US flexibility now.</v>

310
00:13:43.451 --> 00:13:47.710
<v Speaker 1>He did make todd pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty fucking insanely good.</v>

311
00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:48.544
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>todd was a,</v>

312
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.480
<v Speaker 1>was a hell of a quarterback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

313
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.430
<v Speaker 1>But he also was freaking out and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

314
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.550
<v Speaker 1>went to drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think as a release for how,</v>

315
00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.800
<v Speaker 1>how overbearing dad could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

316
00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:02.170
<v Speaker 1>He blew a fuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a really interesting</v>

317
00:14:02.171 --> 00:14:03.910
<v Speaker 1>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of those espn,</v>

318
00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.460
<v Speaker 1>it is 30 for 30 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched it and I was like,</v>

319
00:14:06.461 --> 00:14:07.460
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

320
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:08.860
<v Speaker 1>What a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a weird life.</v>

321
00:14:08.861 --> 00:14:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Having a dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

322
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.590
<v Speaker 1>then he became like a painter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like an artist now.</v>

323
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Todd is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

324
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.540
<v Speaker 1>He could have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worldclass NFL quarterback.</v>

325
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

326
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think the only thing that really</v>

327
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:21.760
<v Speaker 1>derailed that was probably the drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

328
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

329
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Well also desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

330
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.550
<v Speaker 1>I guess he just didn't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

331
00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.430
<v Speaker 1>That's that desire thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to have it in you.</v>

332
00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Like they say that some people do have</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in them and some people don't.</v>

333
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:38.170
<v Speaker 1>And so when you look at someone that</v>
<v Speaker 1>became successful,</v>

334
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.130
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what was it that drove that guy to</v>

335
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:45.790
<v Speaker 1>be so obsessed that he had to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best baseball player,</v>

336
00:14:45.791 --> 00:14:48.010
<v Speaker 1>the best basketball player?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like was it,</v>

337
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.920
<v Speaker 1>was it his upbringing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he have,</v>

338
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:51.771
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with everybody,</v>

339
00:14:51.771 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a</v>

340
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.150
<v Speaker 2>different story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>

341
00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:56.660
<v Speaker 2>they had still had to prove something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe they were born,</v>

342
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

343
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.340
<v Speaker 2>single mom didn't have a father always</v>
<v Speaker 2>angry and they want to prove to the</v>

344
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's those guys a lot.</v>

345
00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:05.040
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of proof to dads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

346
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Jerry West,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his story that he's the guy that's the</v>

347
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:09.920
<v Speaker 2>logo of the NBA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

348
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:14.600
<v Speaker 2>the outline of the player playing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jerry West and he had a really abusive</v>

349
00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:19.601
<v Speaker 2>dad and he even said an interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't think he would be as driven as</v>

350
00:15:20.271 --> 00:15:24.320
<v Speaker 2>good in and be a great player if he</v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't had basically a shitty dad.</v>

351
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:25.430
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

352
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.550
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a lot of that or the Herschel</v>

353
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Walker story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see his,</v>

354
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.220
<v Speaker 2>what was his story?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His story was,</v>

355
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.050
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't anything about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His parents,</v>

356
00:15:33.051 --> 00:15:35.720
<v Speaker 2>he had a good relationship with his was</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting bullied.</v>

357
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was teased and bullied.</v>

358
00:15:38.031 --> 00:15:40.880
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck could bully that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess eight,</v>

359
00:15:40.881 --> 00:15:42.740
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years old,</v>

360
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:44.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking to that.</v>

361
00:15:44.181 --> 00:15:45.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was getting pushed around.</v>

362
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:50.891
<v Speaker 2>He was Chubby and then it was Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was that focus though of I'm not</v>

363
00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 2>going to get pushed around anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

364
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

365
00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:59.591
<v Speaker 2>he started running and doing those</v>
<v Speaker 2>insane claims at least of pushups and</v>

366
00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:01.700
<v Speaker 2>sit ups and then he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

367
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 2>also had genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was freak fucking ass.</v>

368
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.940
<v Speaker 2>He's still a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is still a freak come back then.</v>

369
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:12.020
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about Herschel Walker is</v>
<v Speaker 2>he allegedly never lifted weights.</v>

370
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a big thing.</v>

371
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's true,</v>

372
00:16:15.411 --> 00:16:16.760
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's true either.</v>

373
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Cause a lot of people said they saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I saw him lift weights like people,</v>

374
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.710
<v Speaker 2>I was with him in the fucking weight</v>
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

375
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Like when you talk to a strength and</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioning coaches,</v>

376
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:29.390
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's muscles on that guy that you</v>

377
00:16:29.391 --> 00:16:32.480
<v Speaker 2>really don't develop unless you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>picking up heavy shit.</v>

378
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know if that's the truth.</v>

379
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't push up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Claims are 5,000 a day for back then.</v>

380
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.280
<v Speaker 2>So that's a little also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

381
00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big Herschel Fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a lot of fucking pushups.</v>

382
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.420
<v Speaker 2>I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do that shit that easy.</v>

383
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.100
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

384
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.940
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing it between every commercial,</v>

385
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching shows.</v>

386
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.660
<v Speaker 2>I'll just hit the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bang out like 500 pushups.</v>

387
00:16:53.661 --> 00:16:54.494
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on man.</v>

388
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.290
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

389
00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.090
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

390
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.660
<v Speaker 2>like the fake ones and kind of push up</v>
<v Speaker 2>half ones yet.</v>

391
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he definitely did something right.</v>

392
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Whatever he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he also says something that he said,</v>

393
00:17:07.731 --> 00:17:10.160
<v Speaker 2>some stuff that's not physically</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

394
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he only eats a salad in a bowl of soup a</v>

395
00:17:12.951 --> 00:17:15.590
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not enough calories to keep</v>

396
00:17:15.591 --> 00:17:18.230
<v Speaker 2>your body mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make your whole body.</v>

397
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.550
<v Speaker 2>The only reason why your body is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>size that it is as because you take in</v>

398
00:17:22.551 --> 00:17:25.160
<v Speaker 2>calories I enough to fuel all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle,</v>

399
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't take in enough calories to</v>

400
00:17:27.351 --> 00:17:29.990
<v Speaker 2>fuel all that muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body starts eating that muscle.</v>

401
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just physiology.</v>

402
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.520
<v Speaker 2>So did you wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

403
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:37.580
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to your uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lance Armstrong episode,</v>

404
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.480
<v Speaker 2>how when he was talking about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>writers are just not eat and you go</v>

405
00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:43.220
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you have any energy to ride?</v>

406
00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about a leisurely</v>

407
00:17:45.381 --> 00:17:47.210
<v Speaker 2>stroll down the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

408
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 2>You guys are training for Tour de France</v>
<v Speaker 2>and starving</v>

409
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.250
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>

410
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:55.290
<v Speaker 4>how do you have the probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>amphetamines if not amphetamines,</v>

411
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.270
<v Speaker 4>caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

412
00:17:57.271 --> 00:17:58.170
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

413
00:17:58.171 --> 00:18:01.280
<v Speaker 4>Legal and it isn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just all kinds of cramping going on.</v>

414
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.420
<v Speaker 4>Your body's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would think freaking out.</v>

415
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.760
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck man,</v>

416
00:18:05.761 --> 00:18:10.761
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea how he said that's a very</v>
<v Speaker 4>common like bike cyclists that cyclers</v>

417
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:12.703
<v Speaker 4>colors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

418
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.110
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's cyclists.</v>

419
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.400
<v Speaker 4>It's not cyclers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No</v>

420
00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.850
<v Speaker 4>fucking mad at Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got mad at me,</v>

421
00:18:20.851 --> 00:18:22.110
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

422
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.360
<v Speaker 4>it's cyclists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cyclists don't say cycling is so funny,</v>

423
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.310
<v Speaker 4>but I guess it's like if someone said</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ultimate fighting challenge.</v>

424
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.920
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's championship championship.</v>

427
00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:41.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of mental</v>

428
00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:43.530
<v Speaker 4>toughness involved in that sport for</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

429
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean those fucking people are savages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They really are.</v>

430
00:18:46.361 --> 00:18:47.610
<v Speaker 4>And they really are.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I think it's 21 something insane like</v>

433
00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.160
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>2125 something like that.</v>

434

<v Speaker 4>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A hundred miles a day and 2,500 miles</v>

00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:03.750
<v Speaker 4>total.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I know or have you heard about</v>

439
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.200
<v Speaker 4>back to back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a few people that do them day</v>

440
00:19:16.201 --> 00:19:19.860
<v Speaker 4>after day after day as your body just</v>
<v Speaker 4>sustained,</v>

441
00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:21.210
<v Speaker 4>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In my neighborhood,</v>

<v Speaker 4>100 miles one day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then a hundred miles the next day.</v>

444
00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:31.440
<v Speaker 4>That's a chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hates her husband.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You say my problems make your dicks off.</v>

447
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to write this 200 fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>miles.</v>

448
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.740
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She comes home and their toenails fall</v>

449
00:19:46.741 --> 00:19:48.360
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their toenails fall off when they do</v>

450
00:19:48.361 --> 00:19:50.250
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw a real sports about that</v>

451
00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:55.890
<v Speaker 4>and then a guy who's so didn't care</v>
<v Speaker 4>about that just had them lasered off.</v>

452
00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.020
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they kept falling off and he</v>

453
00:19:58.021 --> 00:19:58.854
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need them.</v>

454
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:03.660
<v Speaker 4>So he just had them watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What purpose do they serve?</v>

455
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.860
<v Speaker 4>The guests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They protect the tips of your fingers.</v>

456
00:20:05.861 --> 00:20:08.640
<v Speaker 4>So that was going on on a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is a weird thing.</v>

457
00:20:08.641 --> 00:20:10.740
<v Speaker 4>When you look at fingernails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are strange.</v>

458
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.760
<v Speaker 4>They really are this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hard surface on the,</v>

459
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.700
<v Speaker 4>like every other animal that has nails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their claws right there,</v>

460
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:23.340
<v Speaker 4>the design to climb things or the design</v>
<v Speaker 4>to kill.</v>

461
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.880
<v Speaker 4>But we have these like weird tips for</v>
<v Speaker 4>good for opening up on envelopes.</v>

462
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.210
<v Speaker 4>Stickers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

463
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.720

465
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.420
<v Speaker 4>It's weird how a person developed and</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only that,</v>

466
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:46.230
<v Speaker 4>like they just keep growing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're supposed to cut them.</v>

467
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 4>Like if you don't cut,</v>

<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

472
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Just grew as nails and they'd grew so</v>
<v Speaker 1>long that he couldn't use his hand.</v>

473
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.130
<v Speaker 1>That's one of them there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They grow like that and what's facile?</v>

474
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Two hands like that I'm on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has to wear like special shirts</v>

475
00:21:10.631 --> 00:21:13.630
<v Speaker 1>with no sleeves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

<v Speaker 2>offensive Lineman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lael Collins hired her to blow him and</v>

<v Speaker 2>but then he didn't pay her.</v>

582
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.010
<v Speaker 2>So she put him on blast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called them out,</v>

583
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:54.340
<v Speaker 2>told media outlets and uh,</v>

584
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:59.960
<v Speaker 2>her snapchat because she'll also post</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes little snaps of her blowing</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

588
00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.860

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>she was a tomboy.</v>

622
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.930
<v Speaker 2>She did a bunch of music videos too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was in,</v>

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I might own actually own it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she puts everybody on blast.</v>

628
00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:52.770
<v Speaker 2>Like Bobby Brown came over her house and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fell asleep on her couch and she,</v>

629
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:55.170
<v Speaker 2>she filmed it.</v>

630
00:27:55.171 --> 00:27:56.004
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

631
00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:00.300
<v Speaker 2>I think the fucked up thing like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I had throat Zyl on my podcasts.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

633
00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I messaged her and she called in,</v>

634
00:28:02.491 --> 00:28:03.570
<v Speaker 2>so she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

635
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.660
<v Speaker 2>she called into the show and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious.</v>

636
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.540
<v Speaker 2>And she was really candid and really</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>

637
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.850
<v Speaker 2>And she basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

638
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.020
<v Speaker 2>I provide this service,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people pay and you know,</v>

639
00:28:16.021 --> 00:28:19.500
<v Speaker 2>I'd never would call you out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the sort of unspoken</v>

640
00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:20.220
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

641
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.420
<v Speaker 2>But when this guy didn't pay up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was fucked up.</v>

642
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we agreed to something and he goes,</v>

643
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:27.480
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only have 100 bucks on me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

645
00:28:29.431 --> 00:28:31.470
<v Speaker 2>So she goes at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I,</v>

646
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called him out.</v>

647
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he treated her like an idiot.</v>

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

649
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Which was the wrong thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a rude guy eat someone's ass.</v>

650
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.410
<v Speaker 2>And then we actually,</v>

652
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:46.050
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

653
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:49.080
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started to discuss which position</v>

658
00:29:00.871 --> 00:29:03.780
<v Speaker 2>It's a big guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said it was a lot of work to get</v>

659
00:29:03.781 --> 00:29:04.480
<v Speaker 2>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

660
00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.250

<v Speaker 2>But with these big guys,</v>

665
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.180
<v Speaker 2>the big guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got to lay on their stomach.</v>

666
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.890
<v Speaker 2>And then you got to kind of open their</v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole out.</v>

667
00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:25.290
<v Speaker 2>Does she require that they go through</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a cleansing procedure?</v>

668
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:27.480
<v Speaker 2>I asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you brought that up and she</v>

669
00:29:27.481 --> 00:29:31.200
<v Speaker 2>said that no one's ever not been ready</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

670
00:29:31.201 --> 00:29:32.910
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cleaned up,</v>

671
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.610
<v Speaker 2>trimmed up everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's ready to go.</v>

672
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.850
<v Speaker 2>No one's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one has to be sent to,</v>

673
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.830
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is known for her work.</v>

674
00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:42.540
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't ask someone to do</v>

679
00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:52.210
<v Speaker 1>electrical work in the pouring rain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

680
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.010
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A great analogy actually.</v>

681
00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only did it cause I saw it in a movie,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what I did?</v>

755
00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I got Hershey's Syrup and I thought it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like Kinky to do it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

766
00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she liked it either.</v>

796
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.490

<v Speaker 4>Why would I want a girl to pretend to be</v>

797
00:34:38.491 --> 00:34:40.860
<v Speaker 4>a dude?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless you love it.</v>

798
00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people like really trainees,</v>

799
00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:43.953
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

800
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.560
<v Speaker 4>Insensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was insensitive with that word.</v>

801
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:49.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You still say cabbies though.</v>

802
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:54.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to take shabby call cabby</v>
<v Speaker 4>point counterpoint.</v>

803
00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:57.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he sounds cute to me.</v>

804
00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.700
<v Speaker 4>It does sound kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why it's bad.</v>

805
00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:00.993
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

806
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.830
<v Speaker 4>it's offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think,</v>

807
00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:05.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it pretty obvious that the attraction</v>

808
00:35:05.791 --> 00:35:10.050
<v Speaker 4>there for the people that are attracted</v>
<v Speaker 4>to it is that it's looks like something</v>

809
00:35:10.051 --> 00:35:10.711
<v Speaker 4>and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

810
00:35:10.711 --> 00:35:13.320
<v Speaker 4>is that the appeal you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

811
00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:16.020
<v Speaker 4>I think people that like transgender</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

812
00:35:16.021 --> 00:35:21.021
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's probably a whole fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>spectrum of different things that people</v>

813
00:35:21.811 --> 00:35:22.950
<v Speaker 4>like them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why they like it,</v>

814
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.440
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think some of them,</v>

815
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:28.440
<v Speaker 4>they like the idea of it being like</v>
<v Speaker 4>naughty,</v>

816
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:33.240
<v Speaker 4>like someone with like she's got tits</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she's got a beautiful face and then</v>

817
00:35:33.241 --> 00:35:34.074
<v Speaker 4>you take her.</v>

818
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:37.383
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

819
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

820
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:43.100
<v Speaker 4>just exciting that it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not t what also could be that you had</v>

821
00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:46.470
<v Speaker 4>some weird experience during your</v>
<v Speaker 4>formative period,</v>

822
00:35:46.471 --> 00:35:48.130
<v Speaker 4>like when you were young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

823
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.270
<v Speaker 4>like when you're developing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently they say,</v>

824
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.910
<v Speaker 4>Chris Ryan has described this to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

825
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:57.900
<v Speaker 4>that there's a state doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris Ryan who wrote that book sex at</v>

826
00:35:57.901 --> 00:36:00.480
<v Speaker 4>dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do podcasts with them all the time.</v>

827
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:05.220
<v Speaker 4>And he was talking about imprinting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as you're young,</v>

828
00:36:05.221 --> 00:36:07.440
<v Speaker 4>like during your formative years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

829
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.610
<v Speaker 4>I think he said between somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 4>between like 11 and 13 are nine and 13</v>

830
00:36:11.611 --> 00:36:15.060
<v Speaker 4>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that something can happen sexually.</v>

831
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:17.220
<v Speaker 4>Like someone could do something to use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

832
00:36:17.221 --> 00:36:18.870
<v Speaker 4>maybe a man can do something nice</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually.</v>

833
00:36:18.871 --> 00:36:21.780
<v Speaker 4>And you might not even be gay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you might get like sexually</v>

834
00:36:21.781 --> 00:36:23.520
<v Speaker 4>imprinted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

835
00:36:23.521 --> 00:36:27.870
<v Speaker 4>that like that somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 4>excites you and some sort of a weird way</v>

836
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 4>even reluctantly excites you.</v>

837
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even reluctantly.</v>

838
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.460
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a lot of people there,</v>

839
00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:36.090
<v Speaker 4>they're afraid of the shame that comes</v>
<v Speaker 4>with liking what you like.</v>

840
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:40.200
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're a supposedly heterosexual</v>

841
00:36:40.201 --> 00:36:42.600
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're really into transgender</v>

842
00:36:42.601 --> 00:36:44.830
<v Speaker 4>women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

843
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:47.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could run a risk of people finding</v>

844
00:36:47.191 --> 00:36:50.480
<v Speaker 4>out at work and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and thinking you're fucked up and um,</v>

845
00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:55.820
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>labeling you so deviant and thinking</v>

846
00:36:56.131 --> 00:36:58.260
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what else is this fucker into?</v>

847
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.500
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's weird.</v>

848
00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:02.370
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

849
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.670
<v Speaker 4>Almost weirder than being gay because</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

850
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's some people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>like gay people.</v>

851
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.000
<v Speaker 4>There's some people are afraid of it or</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a religious thing,</v>

852
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:15.090
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think that that's more accepted.</v>

853
00:37:15.091 --> 00:37:17.700
<v Speaker 4>Maybe even then wanting to date a</v>
<v Speaker 4>transgender person.</v>

854
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:18.833
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

855
00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:20.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in today's world,</v>

856
00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:24.670
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people have come along</v>

857
00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:25.960
<v Speaker 2>way with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

858
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:28.990
<v Speaker 2>at least somewhat accepting</v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexuality.</v>

859
00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:33.160
<v Speaker 2>But when you get to transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big leap for a lot of people.</v>

860
00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:34.203
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

861
00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:34.991
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

862
00:37:34.991 --> 00:37:35.890
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

863
00:37:35.891 --> 00:37:37.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

864
00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:40.600
<v Speaker 4>They start looking at like you like this</v>
<v Speaker 4>is what your cards are.</v>

865
00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:43.420
<v Speaker 4>You got to fucking deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotta take it.</v>

866
00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then some people like,</v>

867
00:37:45.191 --> 00:37:47.050
<v Speaker 4>but my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got the wrong cards.</v>

868
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.690
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] I got out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like inside I got the wrong</v>

869
00:37:49.691 --> 00:37:50.524
<v Speaker 4>cards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

870
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:55.210
<v Speaker 4>Not only do I support that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I support people that feel like a dude,</v>

871
00:37:55.211 --> 00:37:58.330
<v Speaker 4>but want to be a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was definitely born a guy.</v>

872
00:37:58.331 --> 00:37:59.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but ah,</v>

873
00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:01.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

874
00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:02.590
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get a sex change.</v>

875
00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.150
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a shit.</v>

876
00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:04.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gay.</v>

877
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if you tattoo your face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go for it.</v>

878
00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.110
<v Speaker 4>I had never care</v>

879
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:10.350
<v Speaker 2>what turns somebody on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

880
00:38:10.351 --> 00:38:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't understand how it would</v>
<v Speaker 2>bother you when when some people are</v>

881
00:38:14.611 --> 00:38:16.440
<v Speaker 2>afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're seeing like the shame</v>

882
00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:18.870
<v Speaker 2>and people finding out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's amazing to me that it would</v>

883
00:38:18.871 --> 00:38:21.750
<v Speaker 2>bother somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What gets somebody else off?</v>

884
00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:22.840
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

885
00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.930
<v Speaker 4>I think its Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Puritan culture where we're apparently</v>

886
00:38:25.931 --> 00:38:28.390
<v Speaker 4>when you compare us to the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

887
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:32.410
<v Speaker 4>like as far as like what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we like and do you know what we'll</v>

888
00:38:32.411 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 4>accept from society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from people were like one of the most</v>

889
00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:40.210
<v Speaker 1>puritan cultures on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bizarre to think that that's our,</v>

890
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.940
<v Speaker 1>our surroundings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're,</v>

891
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:45.190
<v Speaker 1>when you're in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even think about until you</v>

892
00:38:45.191 --> 00:38:48.970
<v Speaker 1>step out and you see how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know other cultures are.</v>

893
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we make the most porn if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like the yeah,</v>

894
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.460
<v Speaker 1>I bet we make the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think without question we make the</v>

895
00:38:54.461 --> 00:38:56.110
<v Speaker 1>most without question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without question.</v>

896
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because industrywide I'm talking just as</v>

897
00:38:58.811 --> 00:39:00.070
<v Speaker 1>a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

898
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:05.100
<v Speaker 1>there's no other place that's creating</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of content as the San</v>

899
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.093
<v Speaker 1>Fernando Valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be,</v>

900
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fucked now because they have to</v>

901
00:39:07.421 --> 00:39:08.490
<v Speaker 1>wear condoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stats.</v>

902
00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:11.380
<v Speaker 1>That's why there'll be a change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shift,</v>

903
00:39:11.381 --> 00:39:14.530
<v Speaker 1>but for the last 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be California.</v>

904
00:39:14.531 --> 00:39:16.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like when they started shipping</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs overseas,</v>

905
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.780
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God dammit fucking manufacturing jobs.</v>

906
00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:22.180
<v Speaker 1>The fuck the middleclass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder than that to porn.</v>

907
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Shipping all these hard Dick's to her</v>
<v Speaker 1>place needs someone to put this</v>

908
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:27.760
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put them wrapping them up with</v>

909
00:39:27.761 --> 00:39:28.870
<v Speaker 1>rubbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

910
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:30.280
<v Speaker 1>The idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a bummer,</v>

911
00:39:30.281 --> 00:39:31.990
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me to watch that.</v>

912
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to watch a guy wearing a</v>

913
00:39:35.321 --> 00:39:36.280
<v Speaker 1>rubber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

914
00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.420
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

915
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.310
<v Speaker 1>isn't that funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why would you care?</v>

916
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:42.580
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they even try to trick you by having</v>

917
00:39:42.581 --> 00:39:45.080
<v Speaker 1>those like super transparent rubbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

918
00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.070
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>glistening of the Dick just doesn't look</v>

919
00:39:48.071 --> 00:39:50.770
<v Speaker 1>realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't see the end like the rim that</v>

920
00:39:50.771 --> 00:39:51.940
<v Speaker 1>might've went down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

921
00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:56.960
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking rubber robberies dicks</v>
<v Speaker 1>off though.</v>

922
00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it bums me out the most when a girl's</v>

923
00:39:59.411 --> 00:40:03.880
<v Speaker 1>blown a guy with a rubber on just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop Buddy.</v>

924
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Just jerk off on the top of her head and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be better.</v>

925
00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you don't even come near her</v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

926
00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Don't let her blow you the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't like it.</v>

927
00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:19.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see it.</v>

928
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I've seen one of those blooper videos</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they has the guy like,</v>

929
00:40:22.491 --> 00:40:26.890
<v Speaker 1>it's like a double team and one guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>finishes on a girl's head,</v>

930
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:28.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on her hair and she goes,</v>

931
00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:32.740
<v Speaker 1>did you just come in my hair and the</v>

<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

1067
00:46:37.081 --> 00:46:39.510
<v Speaker 4>The other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of those porn stars like you can</v>

1068
00:46:39.511 --> 00:46:41.400

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:43.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it's a pretty penny though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1070
00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.210
<v Speaker 4>A couple of grand?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably think so.</v>

1071
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:46.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But is that awful?</v>

1072
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:47.970
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that worse?</v>

1073
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.590
<v Speaker 4>Here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the big question.</v>

1074
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:52.740
<v Speaker 4>Is that worse?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Easy over there.</v>

1075
00:46:52.741 --> 00:46:53.700
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Getting sick.</v>

1076
00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.160
<v Speaker 4>None of news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1077
00:46:56.850 --> 00:47:01.850
<v Speaker 4>is it worse to have sex with a guy who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>paying you than it is to have sex with a</v>

1078
00:47:03.691 --> 00:47:04.524
<v Speaker 4>guy on film?</v>

1079
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:08.130
<v Speaker 4>Is there a line that's crossed that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mm hmm.</v>

1080
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:10.860
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean by worse though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1081
00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck either way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for some people is the perception</v>

1082
00:47:14.881 --> 00:47:19.881
<v Speaker 4>more so like is it worse to be a girl it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a porn star who also escorts or is</v>

1083
00:47:21.511 --> 00:47:22.500
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it,</v>

1084
00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:26.280
<v Speaker 4>you know what's absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

1085
00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:29.860
<v Speaker 4>it's between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would do it off camera.</v>

1086
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.870
<v Speaker 4>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not documented unless you,</v>

1087
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:34.450
<v Speaker 4>unless for some reason you want it to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>documented,</v>

1088
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:37.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're doing just your escorting,</v>

1089
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.170
<v Speaker 4>well it's just between you and whoever</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do it with.</v>

1090
00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:45.370
<v Speaker 4>So you don't have that social stigma of</v>
<v Speaker 4>being known for doing that.</v>

1091
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:45.941
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1092
00:47:45.941 --> 00:47:47.800
<v Speaker 4>but for those girls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't care about that social</v>

1093
00:47:47.801 --> 00:47:48.850
<v Speaker 4>stigma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got you.</v>

1094
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:49.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's their living.</v>

1095
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.790
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But is it worse?</v>

1096
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:58.230
<v Speaker 4>Is it worse to be an escort and a porn</v>
<v Speaker 4>star or just a porn star?</v>

1097
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:00.780
<v Speaker 4>Or is it a stupid question?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>

1098
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:01.421
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1099
00:48:01.421 --> 00:48:04.960
<v Speaker 4>it might be a stupid question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just feel like they're probably trying</v>

1100
00:48:04.961 --> 00:48:07.120
<v Speaker 4>to get lucrative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what it is.</v>

1101
00:48:07.121 --> 00:48:10.510
<v Speaker 4>So just keep taking those escorts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hires.</v>

1102
00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:12.810
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1103
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.250
<v Speaker 4>Well it's a good move for them for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably get,</v>

1104
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:19.390
<v Speaker 4>I bet some of them get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them I've had the rich dudes</v>

1105
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.810
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which cause they look,</v>

1106
00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:23.440
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then if she was like,</v>

1107
00:48:23.441 --> 00:48:25.240
<v Speaker 4>it's 10,000 and for the guy who was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1108
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:26.620
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1109
00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:27.940
<v Speaker 4>then you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're getting paid man.</v>

1110
00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:29.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1111

<v Speaker 4>Well Red Ban had something and he put on</v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter the other day about a girls that</v>

1115

<v Speaker 4>prostitution reference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh Huh.</v>

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:46.840
<v Speaker 4>Cause that's what a lot of people do</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently.</v>

1117
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:47.831
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

1127
00:49:16.601 --> 00:49:19.870

<v Speaker 4>like they will not violate the speed</v>

1128
00:49:19.871 --> 00:49:21.820
<v Speaker 4>limit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you violate the speed limit,</v>

1133
00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:34.360
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you are in a position like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a driver or a service person,</v>

1134
00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:39.010
<v Speaker 4>like a waiter or waitress or a bartender</v>
<v Speaker 4>or something that you cannot fuck around</v>

1135
00:49:39.011 --> 00:49:40.420
<v Speaker 4>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it is not,</v>

1136

<v Speaker 4>Lamborghini's.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's like everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's literally,</v>

1145
00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:07.330

<v Speaker 4>like a joke.</v>

1146
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:11.290
<v Speaker 4>It was like a scene in a movie of</v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme opulence,</v>

1147
00:50:11.291 --> 00:50:13.510
<v Speaker 4>like over the top opulence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you go,</v>

1148
00:50:13.511 --> 00:50:15.070
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not really like that,</v>

1149
00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:17.620
<v Speaker 4>but it is really like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like everywhere you go,</v>

1150
00:50:17.621 --> 00:50:20.110
<v Speaker 4>everyone's got a million dollar car and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's Bugatti va,</v>

1152
00:50:22.961 --> 00:50:24.280
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

1153
00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:26.620
<v Speaker 4>The amount of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember that the,</v>

1154

1162
00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.670

1163
00:50:49.671 --> 00:50:50.450
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was,</v>

1164
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:51.530
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where'd you get that?</v>

1165
00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:52.581

00:50:52.581 --> 00:50:56.570
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government gave us money because</v>

1167
00:50:56.571 --> 00:50:58.850
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're educating ourselves and coming</v>

1168
00:50:58.851 --> 00:51:02.090
<v Speaker 2>back so they'll pay for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1169
00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:03.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could go,</v>

1170
00:51:03.321 --> 00:51:05.570
<v Speaker 2>if you're a born there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go to the government and be</v>

1171
00:51:05.571 --> 00:51:07.040
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need money for this.</v>

1172
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:08.170
<v Speaker 2>And they would just give you that.</v>

1173
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:11.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was just,</v>

1174
00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:14.280
<v Speaker 4>they were just spending on everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 4>stacks of money.</v>

1175
00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:15.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not supposed to drink there</v>

1176
00:51:15.871 --> 00:51:18.450

<v Speaker 4>but you can't drink in the bars.</v>

1177
00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:23.310
<v Speaker 4>There's certain bars where they allow it</v>
<v Speaker 4>because Americans western picture.</v>

1178
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:26.760
<v Speaker 4>But I got as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they don't want drinking.</v>

1179
00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:28.230
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very strange.</v>

1180
00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:31.320
<v Speaker 4>And I had some friends when we were at</v>

1185
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:43.440
<v Speaker 4>90% prostitutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was all like eastern bloc</v>

1186
00:51:43.441 --> 00:51:44.940
<v Speaker 4>prostitutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you walked in,</v>

1187
00:51:44.941 --> 00:51:47.620
<v Speaker 4>it was like a wolf den and just a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 4>of wolves</v>

1188
00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:53.490

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:49.530
<v Speaker 4>he knows things about certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like he's got to figure out</v>

1211
00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:53.830
<v Speaker 4>like he started doing his own podcast</v>
<v Speaker 4>was guys only thing first.</v>

1212

1213
00:52:57.751 --> 00:52:58.350
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1214
00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:00.720
<v Speaker 4>it'd be so good for you because you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1215
00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:04.380

<v Speaker 4>this weird way about you.</v>

1216
00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:06.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get into it.</v>

1217
00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:07.673
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1218
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:10.350
<v Speaker 4>you'll find people that are wanting that</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanting to see it,</v>

1219
00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:13.350
<v Speaker 4>but right now they only see it if you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>on someone else's show.</v>

1220
00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:14.281
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1221
00:53:14.281 --> 00:53:17.850
<v Speaker 4>and like do your own show and it could</v>
<v Speaker 4>be all your freakiness.</v>

1222
00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:20.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I think also when you do your</v>

1223
00:53:20.821 --> 00:53:24.120
<v Speaker 4>own show too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you realize like how much is involved in</v>

1224
00:53:24.121 --> 00:53:25.970
<v Speaker 4>like managing the sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like</v>

1225
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.320
<v Speaker 2>making sure it steers in the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

1226
00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Thinking about what the subject you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

1227
00:53:32.491 --> 00:53:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Is this entertaining is when do I pick</v>
<v Speaker 2>this up?</v>

1228
00:53:35.821 --> 00:53:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Do I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I ramp it up?</v>

1229
00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:39.810
<v Speaker 2>How do I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I add some new stuff in there?</v>

1230
00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.190
<v Speaker 2>And he has a lot of expense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1231
00:53:41.191 --> 00:53:42.024
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1233
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:44.760

1235
00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:50.310
<v Speaker 2>kind of help shape things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did a lot of people.</v>

1236
00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.570
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if all the people that started</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts with him could tolerate him and</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean we're,</v>

1257
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:34.320
<v Speaker 2>we're part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you in your mom's house is,</v>

1262
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:44.520
<v Speaker 2>collective support thing where</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's still owns their own shows,</v>

1263
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:46.530
<v Speaker 2>but you just kind of have more power in</v>

<v Speaker 2>opposed to just saying one thing.</v>

1270
00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:08.610
<v Speaker 2>You still get to be your own entity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're a part of something when you</v>

1271
00:55:08.611 --> 00:55:09.480

1280
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:30.360

<v Speaker 2>you're getting a few million downloads.</v>

1284
00:55:37.741 --> 00:55:39.570
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We support each other.</v>

1285
00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:41.280
<v Speaker 2>That's the best kind of network,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1286
00:55:41.281 --> 00:55:43.110
<v Speaker 2>That kind of net worth is totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>organic.</v>

1287
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:45.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no financial gain in it at all.</v>

1288
00:55:45.861 --> 00:55:47.100
<v Speaker 2>We all just kind of help each other.</v>

1291
00:55:49.051 --> 00:55:50.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we've,</v>

1292
00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:53.520
<v Speaker 2>as all things comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've also worked with sponsors that,</v>

1293
00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:57.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea was that we're approaching you</v>

1294
00:55:57.241 --> 00:56:00.150
<v Speaker 2>because we have this collective and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>responded to it.</v>

1295
00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:01.053
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1296
00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:03.930
<v Speaker 2>So like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they handled the ads and they bring them</v>

1297
00:56:03.931 --> 00:56:04.800
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that how it works?</v>

1298
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like so with like,</v>

1299
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:08.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our bill approach,</v>

1300
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:09.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1301
00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:13.590
<v Speaker 2>whatever company and say we have 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>

1302
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:19.160
<v Speaker 2>here's our gross amount of downloads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you sign up to do this set amount and</v>

1303
00:56:20.191 --> 00:56:22.740
<v Speaker 2>then kind of divvied up amongst the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that can do it.</v>

1304
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 2>So we've that a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

1305
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.700
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is the amount of money that you get</v>

1306
00:56:27.701 --> 00:56:29.710
<v Speaker 1>based on the amount of downloads that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have?</v>

1307
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1308
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who manages all that?</v>

1309
00:56:33.221 --> 00:56:34.900
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1310
00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:36.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1311
00:56:36.161 --> 00:56:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike is one of the guys over there.</v>

1312
00:56:38.441 --> 00:56:40.420
<v Speaker 1>I think Flynn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm trying to remember another name,</v>

1313
00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:41.261
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1314
00:56:41.261 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 1>it's a job that's a full time job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At a certain point in time though,</v>

1315
00:56:43.931 --> 00:56:46.030
<v Speaker 1>is you're podcast becomes more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

1316
00:56:46.031 --> 00:56:47.560

<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

1317
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:48.750

<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1356
00:58:15.251 --> 00:58:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Then I watched another podcast live</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was like this.</v>

1359
00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Some podcasts are weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1360
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:29.830
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find their own level,</v>

1361
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.080
<v Speaker 1>like water seeks its own level.</v>

1362
00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:35.490
<v Speaker 1>They find their own vibe and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>some podcasts where you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>radio show.</v>

1367
00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.950
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of that too,</v>

1391
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:36.290
<v Speaker 2>comedy comes out and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1392
00:59:36.291 --> 00:59:38.570
<v Speaker 2>this looks like fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1393
00:59:38.571 --> 00:59:42.610
<v Speaker 2>And there's billboards and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>always a few famous people in it.</v>

1394
00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:46.360
<v Speaker 2>And you got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was hating on how shitty it</v>

1395
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:47.780
<v Speaker 2>looked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrible.</v>

1396
00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:48.980
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1397
00:59:48.981 --> 00:59:51.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this wasn't made for you.</v>

1398
00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:52.700
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1399
00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:53.331
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1400
00:59:53.331 --> 00:59:53.751
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1401
00:59:53.751 --> 00:59:55.190
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like there's a,</v>

1402
00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:58.090
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that love this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1403
00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.080
<v Speaker 2>this just isn't for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1404
00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:02.120
<v Speaker 2>it's not made for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I started to think of entertainment</v>

1405
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:05.990
<v Speaker 2>differently from the moment that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>said to me that I see things now,</v>

1406
01:00:05.991 --> 01:00:08.120
<v Speaker 2>trailers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>posters,</v>

1407
01:00:08.121 --> 01:00:09.830
<v Speaker 2>commercials for something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

1408
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.600
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this has made for a different</v>

1409
01:00:11.601 --> 01:00:12.620
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1410
01:00:12.621 --> 01:00:15.140
<v Speaker 2>there's things that are made for me</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I respond to and I go,</v>

1411
01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.040
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking can't.</v>

1412
01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for me.</v>

1413
01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.680
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's so important to do what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like on stage.</v>

1414
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:23.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up wise.</v>

1415
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:24.870
<v Speaker 2>If you start trying to make it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>

1416
01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1417
01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:27.720
<v Speaker 4>Those guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fucked.</v>

1418
01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.360
<v Speaker 4>Those guys who create those squeaky</v>
<v Speaker 4>clean acts,</v>

1419
01:00:30.361 --> 01:00:33.630
<v Speaker 4>but they're not squeaky clean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are tortured people of course,</v>

1420
01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:36.750
<v Speaker 4>because they're literally making art</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not for them.</v>

1421
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:38.340
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you're,</v>

1422
01:00:38.341 --> 01:00:39.390
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1423
01:00:39.391 --> 01:00:42.300
<v Speaker 4>you and you can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you like the audience won't accept it.</v>

1424
01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:46.170
<v Speaker 4>She kept talking about roofing chicks</v>
<v Speaker 4>and sticking around and when they're</v>

1425
01:00:46.171 --> 01:00:47.004
<v Speaker 4>asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1426
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:49.380
<v Speaker 4>I watched,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1427
01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.750
<v Speaker 4>speaking to bill cosby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched his lawyer,</v>

1428
01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:55.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>debate some commentator or some</v>

1429
01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.290
<v Speaker 4>television pundit or whatever you would</v>
<v Speaker 4>call them hosts.</v>

1430
01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.340
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1431
01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.860
<v Speaker 4>she was explaining,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1432
01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:02.880
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1433
01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:07.650
<v Speaker 4>how ridiculous these allegations are and</v>
<v Speaker 4>how Mr Cosby,</v>

1434
01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:10.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't do any of these things and that</v>

1435
01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.000
<v Speaker 4>all these women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like their stories,</v>

1436
01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:14.310
<v Speaker 4>some of them are just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>

1437
01:01:14.311 --> 01:01:18.420
<v Speaker 4>he grabbed them by the wrist hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like some of them aren't even sexual</v>

1438
01:01:18.421 --> 01:01:23.421
<v Speaker 4>allegations and she's like effectively</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of muddying the water and that he</v>

1439
01:01:23.581 --> 01:01:26.970
<v Speaker 4>is a very rich,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wealthy man.</v>

1440
01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:29.630
<v Speaker 4>And then that has to be taken into</v>
<v Speaker 4>consideration that these people are</v>

1441
01:01:29.631 --> 01:01:31.440
<v Speaker 4>doing this for attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

1442
01:01:31.441 --> 01:01:32.400
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

1443
01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:36.690
<v Speaker 4>it's fascinating to watch the spin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dance,</v>

1444
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:37.681
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the guy was saying,</v>

1445
01:01:37.681 --> 01:01:39.390
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's 50 people though.</v>

1446
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:40.141
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she was like,</v>

1447
01:01:40.141 --> 01:01:41.160
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of those 50,</v>

1448
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:44.340
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them are not even sexual</v>
<v Speaker 4>allegations and not even sexual assault</v>

1449
01:01:44.341 --> 01:01:45.400
<v Speaker 4>allegations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I didn't know,</v>

1450
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:49.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only 23 or six 37.</v>

1451
01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1452
01:01:51.391 --> 01:01:53.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he did or not,</v>

1453
01:01:53.101 --> 01:01:58.101
<v Speaker 4>but I haven't heard of another person</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever that's had 50 people claimed that</v>

1454
01:01:59.041 --> 01:02:02.130
<v Speaker 4>he raped them by giving them drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's the,</v>

1455
01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:07.020
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the sad part is the people who</v>

1456
01:02:07.021 --> 01:02:11.130
<v Speaker 4>really want to defend the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the conspiracy theories on it.</v>

1457
01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:11.781
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

1458
01:02:11.781 --> 01:02:13.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was about to buy NBC.</v>

1459
01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you know that he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>making a move to by NBC and they don't</v>

1460
01:02:16.771 --> 01:02:19.080
<v Speaker 4>want a black man in power like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so ridiculous.</v>

1461
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:19.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1462
01:02:19.951 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 4>they</v>

1463
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1464
01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to take down cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's agenda.</v>

1465
01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Was that why they would have taken down</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oprah first?</v>

1466
01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.010
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1467
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.650
<v Speaker 1>It's so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth more than anyone ever.</v>

1468
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>It's so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the most successful entertainer</v>

1469
01:02:35.581 --> 01:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she doesn't even have a talent.</v>

1470
01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Not a singer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not dancer.</v>

1471
01:02:39.871 --> 01:02:41.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not great actress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1472
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:42.840
<v Speaker 1>What'd she do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't tell jokes.</v>

1473
01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:45.600
<v Speaker 1>What she does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She talks to people giving away cars,</v>

1474
01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>will get up in the morning and look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun and think,</v>

1475
01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>eh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1476
01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1477
01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Well she has like positive messages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Positive.</v>

1478
01:02:51.961 --> 01:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>She is really good for menopausal women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they really relate to her.</v>

1479
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a strange way.</v>

1480
01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:57.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1481
01:02:57.931 --> 01:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're vibe down,</v>

1482
01:02:58.801 --> 01:03:03.801
<v Speaker 1>but I get why people do have their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they want to defend them.</v>

1483
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:06.980
<v Speaker 1>I understand the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the motivation and the,</v>

1484
01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:08.370
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and feeling like,</v>

1485
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:09.090
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

1486
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:11.070
<v Speaker 1>The adoration for him and wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>defend.</v>

1487
01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I totally get why they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reality is we don't know.</v>

1488
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

1489
01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1490
01:03:16.411 --> 01:03:18.600
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you could never find 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>liars,</v>

1491
01:03:18.601 --> 01:03:21.960
<v Speaker 1>of course you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you could.</v>

1492
01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:23.610
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1493
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:24.510
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1494
01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:29.930
<v Speaker 1>the argument that I find the most sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ignorant and uninformed is the one</v>

1495
01:03:30.151 --> 01:03:31.590
<v Speaker 1>where people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did they wait that long?</v>

1496
01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1497
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:37.080
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you talk to any sex crimes unit,</v>

1498
01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>officer detective,</v>

1499
01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.530
<v Speaker 1>any psychologist about victims of sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>assault,</v>

1500
01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:47.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not unusual for it to go and report</v>
<v Speaker 1>it or for it to go a long time without</v>

1501
01:03:47.641 --> 01:03:51.630
<v Speaker 1>someone wanting to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's completely within the spectrum of</v>

1502
01:03:51.631 --> 01:03:54.930
<v Speaker 1>normal responses to something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when people are like,</v>

1503
01:03:54.931 --> 01:03:56.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what happened 25 years ago?</v>

1504
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's normal.</v>

1505
01:03:57.210 --> 01:03:59.460
<v Speaker 1>It's normal for someone not to bring it</v>
<v Speaker 1>up completely normal.</v>

1506
01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of shame involved.</v>

1507
01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some women,</v>

1508
01:04:02.011 --> 01:04:04.410
<v Speaker 1>they would rather just forget about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>then report it.</v>

1509
01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would rather just pretend it never</v>

1510
01:04:07.141 --> 01:04:09.990
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then go through all the public shaming</v>

1511
01:04:09.991 --> 01:04:12.210
<v Speaker 1>and then you're dealing with an insanely</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich,</v>

1512
01:04:12.211 --> 01:04:15.180
<v Speaker 1>insanely powerful man who was loved by</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many.</v>

1513
01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:17.640
<v Speaker 1>And then if there was no previous</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegations,</v>

1514
01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:19.650
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck is going to believe you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1515
01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Like to a woman in 1996 let's say back</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was,</v>

1516
01:04:24.511 --> 01:04:26.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not doing the show anymore,</v>

1517
01:04:26.491 --> 01:04:28.020
<v Speaker 1>but he's in his heyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1518
01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:31.800
<v Speaker 1>It's loved by everybody and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugging checks and I'm like,</v>

1519
01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:33.180
<v Speaker 1>she's probably like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does this,</v>

1520
01:04:33.181 --> 01:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>this can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1521
01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:36.360
<v Speaker 1>I'll just fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just eat it.</v>

1522
01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.190
<v Speaker 1>I'll just deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is deal with it.</v>

1523
01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.690
<v Speaker 1>But then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it fucks with them,</v>

1524
01:04:39.691 --> 01:04:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure for a long time.</v>

1525
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1526
01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine?</v>

1527
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the weirdest thing is that some</v>

1528
01:04:44.641 --> 01:04:47.520
<v Speaker 1>of them claimed they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was like in a mentorship role</v>

1535
01:05:04.281 --> 01:05:06.570
<v Speaker 1>little grass fed butter and some mct</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil.</v>

1536
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.820
<v Speaker 1>It's good for the soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's lovely.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1539
01:05:12.721 --> 01:05:14.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a trump supporter,</v>

1540
01:05:14.281 --> 01:05:15.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Time Man.</v>

1541
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Southern</v>

1542
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:23.010
<v Speaker 4>California chapter head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These Bernie Sanders people been fucking</v>

1543
01:05:23.201 --> 01:05:23.771
<v Speaker 4>tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not me.</v>

1544
01:05:23.771 --> 01:05:26.770
<v Speaker 4>There's so mad because I said that</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bernie Sanders supported,</v>

1545
01:05:26.771 --> 01:05:30.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>90% taxing of the rich apparently is not</v>

1546
01:05:30.221 --> 01:05:31.830
<v Speaker 4>exactly true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1547
01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:35.020
<v Speaker 4>this is what assault course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>correct it for the Bernie Sanders people</v>

1548
01:05:35.021 --> 01:05:38.380
<v Speaker 4>cause they get upset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What he did say was they're talking</v>

1549
01:05:38.381 --> 01:05:41.230
<v Speaker 4>about marginal tax rate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which that means if you make over a</v>

1550
01:05:41.231 --> 01:05:43.990
<v Speaker 4>certain amount,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much should you tax?</v>

1551
01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:49.150
<v Speaker 4>And we're gonna cap that are now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was saying that for a marginal tax</v>

1552
01:05:49.151 --> 01:05:50.370
<v Speaker 4>rate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1553
01:05:50.371 --> 01:05:52.090
<v Speaker 4>would you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is 90% too high?</v>

1554
01:05:52.091 --> 01:05:56.320
<v Speaker 4>He said No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's for extremely wealthy people.</v>

1555
01:05:56.321 --> 01:05:59.170
<v Speaker 4>So like say if you make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say if you make 10 million bucks a</v>

1556
01:05:59.171 --> 01:06:01.450
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything over 10 million bucks,</v>

1557
01:06:01.451 --> 01:06:06.120
<v Speaker 4>they would tax at 90% and I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming up with a number for 10 but the,</v>

1558
01:06:06.121 --> 01:06:09.400
<v Speaker 4>the regular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he thinks it's not too much to tax</v>

1559
01:06:09.401 --> 01:06:11.920
<v Speaker 4>90% over amount.</v>

1560
01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:14.650
<v Speaker 4>But the problem with this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking is,</v>

1561
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:15.700
<v Speaker 4>well people say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

1562
01:06:15.701 --> 01:06:17.560
<v Speaker 4>it's going to help other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be a good for other</v>

1563
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:20.050
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not necessarily.</v>

1564
01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:23.170
<v Speaker 4>The problem with that kind of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that money goes to the government and</v>

1565
01:06:23.171 --> 01:06:25.360
<v Speaker 4>the government is a bunch of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>monkeys.</v>

1566
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:26.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the reality.</v>

1567
01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:30.070
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like an insanely ethical,</v>

1568
01:06:30.071 --> 01:06:32.770
<v Speaker 4>really educated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super smart,</v>

1569
01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:35.560
<v Speaker 4>really disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conservative,</v>

1570
01:06:35.561 --> 01:06:39.090
<v Speaker 4>fiscally conservative person who's gonna</v>
<v Speaker 4>take care of this money and allocated</v>

1571
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:40.360
<v Speaker 4>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1572
01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:42.220
<v Speaker 4>you're going to give it to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>government and you get to create bigger</v>

1573
01:06:42.221 --> 01:06:44.470
<v Speaker 4>government and got to create</v>
<v Speaker 4>bureaucracy,</v>

1574
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.000
<v Speaker 4>red tape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more people,</v>

1575
01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:48.940
<v Speaker 4>more bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more jobs that are bullshit jobs.</v>

1576
01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:51.130
<v Speaker 4>It's not necessarily going to help</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1577
01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:52.720
<v Speaker 4>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1578
01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:55.660
<v Speaker 4>I think Bernie Sanders says a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>good shit.</v>

1579
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:59.470
<v Speaker 4>Like people that think that I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Bernie Sanders Hater.</v>

1580
01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.000
<v Speaker 4>He says a lot of good shit.</v>

1581
01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:06.210
<v Speaker 4>I like what he says about marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he says some fucking silly shit too.</v>

1582
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.860
<v Speaker 4>Here's one of the things that he said</v>
<v Speaker 4>that drove me crazy.</v>

1583
01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:14.250
<v Speaker 4>You don't necessarily need a choice of</v>
<v Speaker 4>23 underarm spray deodorants or 18</v>

1584
01:07:14.891 --> 01:07:18.520
<v Speaker 4>different pairs of sneakers when</v>
<v Speaker 4>children are hungry in this country.</v>

1585
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:21.730
<v Speaker 4>Those two things are totally unrelated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's his,</v>

1586
01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:25.990
<v Speaker 4>that's totally unrelated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what if you wanted to open up a</v>

1587
01:07:25.991 --> 01:07:29.650
<v Speaker 4>fucking deodorant company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't be able to open up a</v>

1588
01:07:29.651 --> 01:07:31.480
<v Speaker 4>deodorant company because children are</v>
<v Speaker 4>starving,</v>

1589
01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:36.660
<v Speaker 4>so you should work to to feed children</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's instead of renting in which he</v>

1590
01:07:36.731 --> 01:07:38.830
<v Speaker 4>said that though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we was just talking about the</v>

1591
01:07:38.831 --> 01:07:41.560
<v Speaker 4>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just talking about the world and</v>

1592
01:07:41.561 --> 01:07:46.090
<v Speaker 4>the idea of a choking on choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1593
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:48.640
<v Speaker 4>if too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too many toys that we have too many</v>

1594
01:07:48.641 --> 01:07:51.190
<v Speaker 4>choices that we divert our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's the thing,</v>

1595
01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:55.180
<v Speaker 4>when you think about these choices,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about these choices that</v>

1596
01:07:55.181 --> 01:08:00.181
<v Speaker 4>are created by whatever percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever number of 300 million people,</v>

1597
01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:05.380
<v Speaker 4>that has nothing to do with whether or</v>
<v Speaker 4>not poor people get fed.</v>

1598
01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.050
<v Speaker 4>It just doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1599
01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:11.530
<v Speaker 4>And the what in taking money away from</v>
<v Speaker 4>wealthy people,</v>

1600
01:08:11.531 --> 01:08:14.350
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not poor people get fed.</v>

1601
01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:18.680
<v Speaker 4>I think that one of the things that he</v>
<v Speaker 4>said that I agree with wholeheartedly is</v>

1602
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:22.460
<v Speaker 4>they need to stop people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these corporations from hiding their</v>

1603
01:08:22.461 --> 01:08:24.470
<v Speaker 4>money overseas where they don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay taxes on it.</v>

1604
01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hundred percent hundred percent I</v>

1605
01:08:26.841 --> 01:08:30.290
<v Speaker 4>think that's fucking criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want all the benefits of living</v>

1606
01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:32.720
<v Speaker 4>in America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want all the benefits that are</v>

1607
01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:35.750
<v Speaker 4>provided to you by this free country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you want to store your money</v>

1608
01:08:35.751 --> 01:08:37.760
<v Speaker 4>overseas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>

1609
01:08:37.761 --> 01:08:40.130
<v Speaker 4>and you don't want to pay taxes on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>

1610
01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:45.340
<v Speaker 4>But maybe there's some compromise where</v>
<v Speaker 4>that tax rate does get adjusted for that</v>

1611
01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.740
<v Speaker 4>a little bit so that they have the</v>
<v Speaker 4>incentive.</v>

1612
01:08:48.741 --> 01:08:50.330
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause the right cat over here.</v>

1613
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:51.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because right now the reason they're</v>

1614
01:08:51.891 --> 01:08:56.210
<v Speaker 4>saying well I'm going to keep it over</v>
<v Speaker 4>there cause I'm saving so much fucking</v>

1615
01:08:56.211 --> 01:08:58.190
<v Speaker 4>money but they make so much money.</v>

1616
01:08:58.190 --> 01:08:58.981
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

1617
01:08:58.981 --> 01:09:02.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying those are greedy Kershaw</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure they are.</v>

1618
01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:05.090
<v Speaker 4>Because you're talking about people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are making insane amounts of money that</v>

1619
01:09:05.091 --> 01:09:07.930
<v Speaker 4>are doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People that are barely bought theirs.</v>

1620
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:10.860
<v Speaker 4>So I think in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah they,</v>

1621
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:13.250
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a hundred percent with him on that</v>

1622
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:17.120
<v Speaker 4>and corporate tax shelters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of like really sneaky shit</v>

1623
01:09:17.121 --> 01:09:19.460
<v Speaker 4>where you find out companies made</v>
<v Speaker 4>billions of dollars and they paid almost</v>

1624
01:09:19.461 --> 01:09:21.350
<v Speaker 4>nothing in taxes cause it's shelters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shame.</v>

1625
01:09:21.351 --> 01:09:24.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm 100% with him on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's got a lot of really good</v>

1626
01:09:24.351 --> 01:09:25.400
<v Speaker 4>points.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a really,</v>

1627
01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:29.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's 100% down with pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate that.</v>

1628
01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:33.410
<v Speaker 4>His position on cannabis is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's totally on unnecessary and criminal</v>

1629
01:09:33.411 --> 01:09:36.410
<v Speaker 4>to have it illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe 100% on that and I also</v>

1630
01:09:36.411 --> 01:09:39.590
<v Speaker 4>support them 100% on the idea of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>living wage.</v>

1631
01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:42.680
<v Speaker 4>Like if somebody works 40 hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should be able to feed themselves</v>

1632
01:09:42.681 --> 01:09:43.700
<v Speaker 4>and have a roof over their head.</v>

1633
01:09:43.730 --> 01:09:46.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 100% down with that.</v>

1634
01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:49.340
<v Speaker 4>I think a minimum wage for a kid who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>in high school or something like that,</v>

1635
01:09:49.341 --> 01:09:51.950
<v Speaker 4>it's still lives their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one thing and I think there are</v>

1636
01:09:51.951 --> 01:09:56.210
<v Speaker 4>entry level jobs like that where someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>should make whatever it is,</v>

1637
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:59.090
<v Speaker 4>but it should be enough where you could</v>
<v Speaker 4>live.</v>

1638
01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:01.910
<v Speaker 4>You know if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a person who's 18 years or</v>

1639
01:10:01.911 --> 01:10:05.750
<v Speaker 4>older and you're working at a job and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are spending eight hours of every 24</v>

1640
01:10:05.751 --> 01:10:08.750
<v Speaker 4>hours a day working for someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should make a living.</v>

1641
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:11.480
<v Speaker 4>You should be able to feed yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>without worry.</v>

1642
01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:13.790
<v Speaker 4>Clothe yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not talking about opulence,</v>

1643
01:10:13.791 --> 01:10:16.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm not talking about wealth driving a</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mercedes,</v>

1644
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.190
<v Speaker 4>but you should definitely be able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>take care of yourself should.</v>

1645
01:10:19.191 --> 01:10:21.380
<v Speaker 4>I think the problem with that when</v>
<v Speaker 4>people cause a lot,</v>

1646
01:10:21.381 --> 01:10:23.660
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of people would agree with</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is it's always,</v>

1647
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:26.090
<v Speaker 4>well how are we going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's going to pay for that?</v>

1648
01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:29.180
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is right and then you go,</v>

1649
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:32.150
<v Speaker 4>where?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where will the money come from to</v>

1650
01:10:32.151 --> 01:10:34.550
<v Speaker 4>support making that a reality?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1651
01:10:34.551 --> 01:10:36.110
<v Speaker 4>I think the money's got to come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1652
01:10:36.111 --> 01:10:38.120
<v Speaker 4>it's gotta be profitable business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1653
01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:39.920
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you've got a profitable business,</v>

1654
01:10:39.921 --> 01:10:44.000
<v Speaker 4>how much of the profit goes to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>employees and how much of the profit</v>

1655
01:10:44.001 --> 01:10:45.820
<v Speaker 4>goes to the owner of the business?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1656
01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.260
<v Speaker 4>Like say if you have a diamond business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1657
01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.620
<v Speaker 4>and you're selling diamonds and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>employees are making $5 an hour,</v>

1658
01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:52.850
<v Speaker 4>that's kind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kinda fucked up.</v>

1659
01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're making millions and you're</v>

1660
01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:58.580
<v Speaker 4>paying your employee $5 an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it,</v>

1661
01:10:58.581 --> 01:10:59.810
<v Speaker 4>seven now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the minimum?</v>

1662
01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:01.100
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

1663
01:11:01.101 --> 01:11:04.400
<v Speaker 4>and that's obviously an extreme example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in that extreme example,</v>

1664
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:05.750
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1665
01:11:05.751 --> 01:11:08.180
<v Speaker 4>you need to pay more money to people who</v>
<v Speaker 4>work for you.</v>

1666
01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:11.000
<v Speaker 4>If someone do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they didn't work for you,</v>

1667
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:12.560
<v Speaker 4>your job wouldn't work.</v>

1668
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:16.470
<v Speaker 4>Like you need someone say if you run a</v>
<v Speaker 4>car manufacturing business,</v>

1669
01:11:16.471 --> 01:11:17.304
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1670
01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:20.880
<v Speaker 4>If you don't have employees that put</v>
<v Speaker 4>together those cars,</v>

1671
01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:24.150
<v Speaker 4>you literally don't have cars so you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have anything to sell.</v>

1672
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:27.720
<v Speaker 4>So you need to pay those fucking people</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they are the reason why your</v>

1673
01:11:27.721 --> 01:11:29.520
<v Speaker 4>car's getting made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if they do a good job,</v>

1674
01:11:29.521 --> 01:11:30.420
<v Speaker 4>they should be paid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1675
01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.620
<v Speaker 4>I totally agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1676
01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:32.610
<v Speaker 4>nothing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1677
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:38.120
<v Speaker 4>it's horrible when somebody applies</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves to a job and can't sustain</v>

1678
01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:39.580
<v Speaker 4>the minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1679
01:11:39.610 --> 01:11:41.410
<v Speaker 4>Like having a place to live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>paying for food.</v>

1680
01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.510
<v Speaker 4>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's terrible.</v>

1681
01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:43.440
<v Speaker 4>I totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1682
01:11:43.650 --> 01:11:45.330
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only thing that I'm not smart enough</v>

1683
01:11:45.331 --> 01:11:47.280
<v Speaker 4>to definitely figure out is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1684
01:11:47.281 --> 01:11:49.260
<v Speaker 4>what is that number?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

1685
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:50.131
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1686
01:11:50.131 --> 01:11:54.900
<v Speaker 4>do you then dictate to different places</v>
<v Speaker 4>of business?</v>

1687
01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.510
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be this number or it's gotta</v>
<v Speaker 4>be this percentage,</v>

1688
01:11:57.511 --> 01:11:58.320
<v Speaker 4>at least,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1689
01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.450
<v Speaker 4>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you make it a reality?</v>

1690
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:02.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1691
01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:06.540
<v Speaker 4>I do know that like Obamacare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>according to everyone that I know that</v>

1692
01:12:06.541 --> 01:12:08.910
<v Speaker 4>runs a business is a fucking disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really can.</v>

1693
01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:12.750
<v Speaker 4>It's costing people way more money and</v>
<v Speaker 4>costing businesses way more money.</v>

1694
01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:16.690
<v Speaker 4>I've yet to hear anybody make a</v>
<v Speaker 4>convincing argument why,</v>

1695
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:19.110
<v Speaker 4>why it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But on the other hand,</v>

1696
01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:23.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fan of the idea of socialized</v>
<v Speaker 4>medicine.</v>

1697
01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:25.440
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that medicine should be just</v>

1698
01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:29.610
<v Speaker 4>like the police and the fire department.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you should they the hoop that</v>

1699
01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:31.770
<v Speaker 4>people who do it should be paid really</v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

1700
01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:36.570
<v Speaker 4>They should have an incentive to want</v>
<v Speaker 4>those jobs and the people should be able</v>

1701
01:12:36.571 --> 01:12:39.330
<v Speaker 4>to get the services for free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really think that,</v>

1702
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:40.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1703
01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:44.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not opposed to private doctors.</v>

1704
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:45.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if,</v>

1705
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:46.081
<v Speaker 4>if you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1706
01:12:46.081 --> 01:12:47.820
<v Speaker 4>if you're a bad ass fucking knee</v>
<v Speaker 4>surgeon,</v>

1707
01:12:47.821 --> 01:12:50.520
<v Speaker 4>you work on the NBA and you work on all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these different people and you're just</v>

1708
01:12:50.521 --> 01:12:53.070
<v Speaker 4>the best of what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should totally be able to work</v>

1709
01:12:53.071 --> 01:12:53.904
<v Speaker 4>privately.</v>

1710
01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:58.970
<v Speaker 4>But the government could easily allocate</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough money to provide public health</v>

1711
01:13:00.201 --> 01:13:01.890
<v Speaker 4>care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just if it's been done in other</v>

1712
01:13:01.891 --> 01:13:04.020
<v Speaker 4>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that it can't be done here.</v>

1713
01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:06.540
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do at other places.</v>

1714
01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:09.300
<v Speaker 4>They don't do it well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's sucks in England.</v>

1715
01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:11.310
<v Speaker 4>It fucking sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it really?</v>

1716
01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:14.130
<v Speaker 4>Everybody I talked to you that lives</v>
<v Speaker 4>over there and tell you it's a year.</v>

1717
01:13:14.131 --> 01:13:16.680
<v Speaker 4>If you hurt yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get surgery.</v>

1718
01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:19.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause people always cite Canada too.</v>

1719
01:13:19.171 --> 01:13:19.820
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1720
01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:22.380
<v Speaker 4>Canada is a joke too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I know that,</v>

1721
01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:26.070
<v Speaker 4>I know a couple of Canadian people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>when shit got serious,</v>

1722
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:29.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they needed to see a cardiovascular</v>

1723
01:13:29.251 --> 01:13:32.280
<v Speaker 4>surgeon and they talk about that weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

1724
01:13:32.281 --> 01:13:34.500
<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's fly over to the Mayo Clinic.</v>

1725
01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:35.353
<v Speaker 4>And exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1726
01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:36.960
<v Speaker 4>and then you shut off the money though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1727
01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:41.840
<v Speaker 4>Then you have to come to America and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to pay for a hotel and airfare and</v>

1728
01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:43.740
<v Speaker 4>who knows if you have that money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1729
01:13:43.741 --> 01:13:46.170
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's gotta be some sort of a</v>

1730
01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:49.020
<v Speaker 4>comfortable middle ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's got to be,</v>

1731
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:51.510
<v Speaker 4>well it's sort of like public school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1732
01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:54.420
<v Speaker 4>like you can get educated in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>country if you don't have enough money.</v>

1733
01:13:54.650 --> 01:13:56.550
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But is it a good education?</v>

1734
01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:58.650
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of parts is a lot of parts.</v>

1735
01:13:58.890 --> 01:14:02.310
<v Speaker 4>Not a lot of parts of California and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Southern California,</v>

1736
01:14:02.311 --> 01:14:05.460
<v Speaker 4>Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the richest fucking cities and</v>

1737
01:14:05.461 --> 01:14:09.450
<v Speaker 4>all of the United States and the schools</v>
<v Speaker 4>are dog shit.</v>

1738
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:11.883
<v Speaker 4>Dog Shit</v>

1739
01:14:13.630 --> 01:14:15.370
<v Speaker 2>terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't be an excuse for that.</v>

1740
01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know also you're dealing with</v>

1741
01:14:17.531 --> 01:14:18.364
<v Speaker 2>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1742
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:20.320
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with extreme levels of</v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty.</v>

1743
01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Engineering that and trying to fix that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not an easy task.</v>

1744
01:14:24.130 --> 01:14:29.130
<v Speaker 2>But I just don't think you do that by</v>
<v Speaker 2>limiting the amount of underarm sprays</v>

1745
01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:33.730
<v Speaker 2>or toothpastes are fucking the flavors</v>
<v Speaker 2>of ice cream or whatever the fuck you</v>

1746
01:14:33.731 --> 01:14:34.930
<v Speaker 2>want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see the,</v>

1747
01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:36.490
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1748
01:14:36.491 --> 01:14:39.010
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's been a businessman</v>

1749
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.210
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1750
01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:41.590
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1751
01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.620
<v Speaker 2>That's what I like about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like a lot of things about</v>

1752
01:14:44.621 --> 01:14:46.660
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like how he talks about</v>

1753
01:14:46.661 --> 01:14:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit drives me crazy.</v>

1754
01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:51.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the idea of people sneaking over</v>

1755
01:14:51.731 --> 01:14:53.110
<v Speaker 2>here over the border like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1756
01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:56.080
<v Speaker 2>how do you not have compassion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these fucking people are born a</v>

1757
01:14:56.081 --> 01:14:58.680
<v Speaker 2>third world country that's attached to</v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

1758
01:14:58.800 --> 01:14:59.980
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows what he's saying,</v>

1759
01:14:59.981 --> 01:15:01.440
<v Speaker 2>what he's doing that he's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

1760
01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's playing to what he knows.</v>

1761
01:15:03.611 --> 01:15:05.740
<v Speaker 2>We'll get people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're goddamn right.</v>

1762
01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:07.190
<v Speaker 2>You know that place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1763
01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:11.560
<v Speaker 2>He knows that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that saying those controversial</v>

1764
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:14.410
<v Speaker 2>things that are going to get in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>paper.</v>

1765
01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:15.670
<v Speaker 2>Also going to get people going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1766
01:15:15.671 --> 01:15:17.230
<v Speaker 2>at least someone saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1767
01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.120
<v Speaker 2>I think he knows that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's an accident.</v>

1768
01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you probably write in a lot of</v>

1769
01:15:21.791 --> 01:15:24.160
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he gets a big response from</v>

1770
01:15:24.161 --> 01:15:26.530
<v Speaker 2>that and then he feeds off that</v>
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

1771
01:15:26.531 --> 01:15:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's a successful businessman.</v>

1772
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:31.120
<v Speaker 2>You know what's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone told me though?</v>

1773
01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:34.360
<v Speaker 2>It's really kind of fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he took that money that his father</v>

1774
01:15:34.361 --> 01:15:37.390
<v Speaker 2>gave him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his father gave him 2 million bucks to</v>

1775
01:15:37.391 --> 01:15:40.360
<v Speaker 2>start his business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he took that money and put it in a</v>

1776
01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:41.780
<v Speaker 2>mutual account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1777
01:15:41.781 --> 01:15:45.490
<v Speaker 2>it would be worth way more than he</v>
<v Speaker 2>currently is worth that.</v>

1778
01:15:45.490 --> 01:15:49.540
<v Speaker 2>I do not believe I would really check</v>
<v Speaker 2>your friend pretty fucking hard.</v>

1779
01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:50.710
<v Speaker 2>I was up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I a friend,</v>

1780
01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.880
<v Speaker 2>like someone told me on the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he makes that money in a fund,</v>

1781
01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:58.870
<v Speaker 2>that would have been probably around 35</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

1782
01:15:59.030 --> 01:16:03.460
<v Speaker 2>$2 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His net worth conservatively is around</v>

1783
01:16:03.461 --> 01:16:06.370
<v Speaker 2>four and a half billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1784
01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:07.750
<v Speaker 2>do you really think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1785
01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:09.680
<v Speaker 2>a mutual fund would have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1786
01:16:09.681 --> 01:16:10.960
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look at it.</v>

1787
01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:15.100
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you a google that if Donald</v>

1788
01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Trump took the money that his father</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave him and invested it and blank,</v>

1789
01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.930
<v Speaker 2>there's whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1790
01:16:21.970 --> 01:16:22.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that,</v>

1791
01:16:22.841 --> 01:16:25.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that equation is.</v>

1792
01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he would have bought apple stock,</v>

1793
01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:28.960
<v Speaker 2>let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1794
01:16:28.961 --> 01:16:31.660
<v Speaker 2>it would have been crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it'd be four and a half.</v>

1795
01:16:31.661 --> 01:16:32.700
<v Speaker 2>What about Google?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1796
01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:33.850
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

1797
01:16:34.450 --> 01:16:36.510
<v Speaker 2>That was some big money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that,</v>

1798
01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:39.610
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know it's funny is that he goes,</v>

1799
01:16:39.611 --> 01:16:44.611
<v Speaker 2>I'm worth 10 billion and Forbes did this</v>
<v Speaker 2>breakdown of all his assets,</v>

1800
01:16:44.861 --> 01:16:45.611
<v Speaker 2>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1801
01:16:45.611 --> 01:16:46.000
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>

1802
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:46.541
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1803
01:16:46.541 --> 01:16:47.830
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I get that.</v>

1804
01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:50.170
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of how he argues things is</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1805
01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:51.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am though.</v>

1806
01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have the substance right</v>

1807
01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:55.720
<v Speaker 2>facts behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just says,</v>

1808
01:16:55.721 --> 01:16:56.471
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they go,</v>

1809
01:16:56.471 --> 01:16:57.251
<v Speaker 2>why are you saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1810
01:16:57.251 --> 01:16:59.110
<v Speaker 2>because it sounds better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds better to be worth 10 than</v>

1811
01:16:59.111 --> 01:17:00.880
<v Speaker 2>four and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did He admit that?</v>

1812
01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:04.270
<v Speaker 2>He said that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said it's because it sounds better,</v>

1813
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:05.770
<v Speaker 2>and they said too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1814
01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:09.500
<v Speaker 2>if he were to make him worth 10 he would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to,</v>

1815
01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:12.920
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd be inflating the value of a lot of</v>

1816
01:17:12.921 --> 01:17:14.150
<v Speaker 2>his holdings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1817
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.710
<v Speaker 2>it's like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1818
01:17:15.711 --> 01:17:20.711
<v Speaker 2>I have this house and it's worth $65</v>
<v Speaker 2>million but nobody wants to buy it.</v>

1819
01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:21.681
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1820
01:17:21.681 --> 01:17:24.650
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>houses in that neighborhood sell for</v>

1821
01:17:24.651 --> 01:17:27.110
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sell for 3 million and he goes,</v>

1822
01:17:27.111 --> 01:17:29.690
<v Speaker 2>not mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my 65.</v>

1823
01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's how he determines that he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth 10.</v>

1824
01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:35.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1825
01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:38.210
<v Speaker 2>Just tell people no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong.</v>

1826
01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think he can hang at all</v>

1827
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:47.950
<v Speaker 2>with the elite politicians when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to substance and knowing actual policy,</v>

1828
01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:51.560
<v Speaker 2>knowing details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

1829
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:55.100
<v Speaker 2>But here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is anybody who's running for president</v>

1830
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:57.620
<v Speaker 2>and elite politician?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1831
01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:02.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean you'd have to say that Hillary's</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least way more savvy and knows a lot</v>

1832
01:18:03.411 --> 01:18:05.540
<v Speaker 2>more about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1833
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:08.660
<v Speaker 2>certainly you know how the world works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>International Affairs.</v>

1834
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:13.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean she was secretary of state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She knows the ins and outs of a lot of</v>

1835
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:14.960
<v Speaker 2>what you would assume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She knows that,</v>

1836
01:18:14.961 --> 01:18:17.990
<v Speaker 2>but wouldn't she know not to use a</v>
<v Speaker 2>private email account while she's</v>

1837
01:18:17.991 --> 01:18:19.710
<v Speaker 2>secretary of state?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1838
01:18:19.711 --> 01:18:21.800
<v Speaker 2>She go to jail for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

1839
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:23.900
<v Speaker 2>That's something that if somebody wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to push,</v>

1840
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:25.460
<v Speaker 2>that's a crime.</v>

1841
01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:27.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to do this.</v>

1842
01:18:27.671 --> 01:18:32.540
<v Speaker 2>Still don't understand why even though</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still discuss how you kind of get</v>

1843
01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.610
<v Speaker 2>away with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it just feels like I don't get it.</v>

1844
01:18:35.150 --> 01:18:38.060
<v Speaker 2>But I mean she's certainly more savvy</v>
<v Speaker 2>politician.</v>

1845
01:18:38.061 --> 01:18:41.120
<v Speaker 2>I think that trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what his savvy though.</v>

1846
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Well cause he's saying shit that's led</v>
<v Speaker 2>him to a 39% lead over any other</v>

1847
01:18:46.311 --> 01:18:49.370
<v Speaker 2>candidate in the Republican Party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when Ben Carson?</v>

1848
01:18:49.450 --> 01:18:51.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like on the the cost line.</v>

1849
01:18:51.671 --> 01:18:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1850
01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:53.920
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was ahead of them at one point in</v>

1851
01:18:53.921 --> 01:18:54.260
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1852
01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:55.093
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1853
01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:56.930
<v Speaker 2>that all dry it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1854
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:59.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people are really into the idea</v>

1855
01:18:59.331 --> 01:19:00.950
<v Speaker 2>of the fantasy of a trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1856
01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:04.280
<v Speaker 2>But I still think if you get to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>debate,</v>

1857
01:19:05.210 --> 01:19:06.830
<v Speaker 2>it's not that he wouldn't win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he'd win,</v>

1858
01:19:06.831 --> 01:19:08.030
<v Speaker 2>but it would be based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1859
01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking loser.</v>

1860
01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.570
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says shit like that.</v>

1861
01:19:11.571 --> 01:19:12.410
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

1862
01:19:12.411 --> 01:19:14.390
<v Speaker 2>No one ever does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it seems to work.</v>

1863
01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:16.220
<v Speaker 2>It's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1864
01:19:16.221 --> 01:19:17.720
<v Speaker 2>And then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I guess you could argue,</v>

1865
01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:19.400
<v Speaker 2>see he is savvy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1866
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:20.600
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1867
01:19:20.601 --> 01:19:22.970
<v Speaker 2>I guess he's not savvy in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional sense.</v>

1868
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:27.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he knows the INS and outs</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the way a lot of things work.</v>

1869
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:29.180
<v Speaker 2>I think his whole thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1870
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:31.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm super successful and I'll get it</v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

1871
01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the wildlife,</v>

1872
01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.990
<v Speaker 2>lot of the ways that things work or kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of bullshit,</v>

1873
01:19:36.850 --> 01:19:40.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crony politics and influenced by</v>

1874
01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:45.950
<v Speaker 2>gigantic corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have that same sort of</v>

1875
01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:47.960
<v Speaker 2>influence cause he's independently</v>
<v Speaker 2>wealthy.</v>

1876
01:19:48.010 --> 01:19:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of weirdness to that.</v>

1877
01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:52.700
<v Speaker 2>There is like special interest groups</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't really have the same sort of pull</v>

1878
01:19:52.701 --> 01:19:55.100
<v Speaker 2>on him that they have on other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>know they can't own them.</v>

1879
01:19:55.101 --> 01:19:57.050
<v Speaker 2>They would never let him say the shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's saying</v>

1880
01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:01.940
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And lots of put a wall between us and</v>

1899
01:20:45.001 --> 01:20:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Because she uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had claimed that she was a trump</v>

1900
01:20:49.321 --> 01:20:51.600

<v Speaker 1>supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like all for it.</v>

1905
01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.900

<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1913

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to happen again.</v>

1952
01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Well probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he probably planned for in</v>

1953
01:22:55.681 --> 01:22:57.480
<v Speaker 1>advance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably pretty good chess player.</v>

1954
01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But they canceled that show after we</v>

1956
01:23:02.521 --> 01:23:04.650
<v Speaker 1>talk shit about Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1958
01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:07.840
<v Speaker 4>did their partnership.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had a whole line of,</v>

1959
01:23:07.841 --> 01:23:09.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trump ties and shirts,</v>

1960
01:23:09.711 --> 01:23:12.700
<v Speaker 4>trump ties.</v>

<v Speaker 4>We're done with you.</v>

1962
01:23:14.530 --> 01:23:19.530

<v Speaker 4>or NBC threatened to not air his thing,</v>

1963
01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:23.500
<v Speaker 4>posted the contract and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll steal your balls off.</v>

1964
01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:27.290
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>NBC had a contract with him to Air Miss</v>

1965
01:23:27.291 --> 01:23:27.941
<v Speaker 4>Universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1966
01:23:27.941 --> 01:23:29.500
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't Miss Universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's his,</v>

1967
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:31.660
<v Speaker 4>well he sold it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he owned,</v>

1968
01:23:31.661 --> 01:23:36.661
<v Speaker 4>he owned Miss Universe and maybe Miss</v>
<v Speaker 4>America to be on those various pageants.</v>

1969
01:23:37.450 --> 01:23:39.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just to be around checks.</v>

1970
01:23:39.111 --> 01:23:41.190
<v Speaker 4>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he literally thought those to be around</v>

1971
01:23:41.191 --> 01:23:42.820
<v Speaker 4>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>

1972
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:46.210
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good move on his part.</v>

1973
01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:47.960
<v Speaker 4>It's a gangster move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a billionaire.</v>

1974
01:23:47.961 --> 01:23:49.310
<v Speaker 4>I bought a pageant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

1975
01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:52.360
<v Speaker 4>Then he just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like the Czech Republic this year.</v>

1976
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:53.223
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>

1977
01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:56.640
<v Speaker 1>I find it kind of like some more</v>
<v Speaker 1>information about what he inherited.</v>

1978
01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1979
01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:00.570
<v Speaker 1>he was also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when his father died in 1974,</v>

1980
01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:04.590
<v Speaker 1>him and his siblings took over a $200</v>
<v Speaker 1>million real estate business,</v>

1981
01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:08.910
<v Speaker 1>which he may have gotten around $40</v>
<v Speaker 1>million of the bottom of this says if he</v>

1982
01:24:08.911 --> 01:24:12.570
<v Speaker 1>invested that and since 1974 and the s</v>
<v Speaker 1>and p 500,</v>

1983
01:24:12.571 --> 01:24:14.220
<v Speaker 1>he could be worth around 3 billion</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

1984
01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it kind of makes sense.</v>

1985
01:24:16.530 --> 01:24:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's also 40 million,</v>

1986
01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.480
<v Speaker 1>not to just the one or whatever he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>given.</v>

1987
01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:25.110
<v Speaker 1>And what does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was current claim network of 8.7</v>

1988
01:24:25.111 --> 01:24:29.820
<v Speaker 1>billion would equate to around 120</v>
<v Speaker 1>million in 1974 which is right in the</v>

1989
01:24:29.821 --> 01:24:34.821
<v Speaker 1>middle estimates of what he inherited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means if he invested that,</v>

1990
01:24:36.230 --> 01:24:38.090
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's confused.</v>

1991
01:24:38.091 --> 01:24:43.091
<v Speaker 1>It says the s and P is up 74 or 74 fold</v>
<v Speaker 1>since 1974 I see you didn't do anything</v>

1992
01:24:43.981 --> 01:24:46.230
<v Speaker 1>and just left it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be about 120 million.</v>

1993
01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:49.140
<v Speaker 1>But if he did other chances and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>got good business,</v>

1994
01:24:49.530 --> 01:24:51.480
<v Speaker 1>things went well for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be worth up to three.</v>

1995
01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what they're saying is here,</v>

1996
01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:57.300
<v Speaker 1>here's a clear example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says if he had invested the 40 million</v>

1997
01:24:57.570 --> 01:25:02.570
<v Speaker 1>in an s and p 500 index fund,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be worth about 3 billion today,</v>

1998
01:25:02.791 --> 01:25:07.410
<v Speaker 1>which is in line with the third party</v>
<v Speaker 1>estimates of 3 billion and 4 billion,</v>

1999
01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.830
<v Speaker 1>which is his net worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they estimate between three and 4</v>

2000
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:11.280
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2001
01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is probably right.</v>

2002
01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Still baller.</v>

2003
01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:17.020
<v Speaker 4>Well are still baller,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have to listen.</v>

2004
01:25:17.170 --> 01:25:19.020
<v Speaker 4>You can do whatever he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How fucking good.</v>

2005
01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:21.190
<v Speaker 4>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's making a mockery of the whole</v>

2006
01:25:21.191 --> 01:25:22.810
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like a lot of things about him.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like he knows what he's doing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He's a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows what he's doing.</v>

2013
01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:42.363
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 4>radical Muslim terrorists if taken over</v>

<v Speaker 4>The first ad came out.</v>

2050

<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>

2051
01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:12.710
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>His first ad.</v>

2052
01:27:14.050 --> 01:27:16.400
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're kidding.</v>

2053
01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.510
<v Speaker 4>But this was the beginning of Craig it</v>

2054
01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:22.020
<v Speaker 5>and I approve this message.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The politicians can pretend it's</v>

2055
01:27:22.021 --> 01:27:24.850
<v Speaker 5>something else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Donald Trump calls it radical</v>

2056
01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:28.330
<v Speaker 5>Islamic terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why he's calling for a temporary</v>

2057
01:27:28.331 --> 01:27:32.110
<v Speaker 5>shutdown of Muslims entering the United</v>
<v Speaker 5>States until we can figure out what's</v>

2058
01:27:32.111 --> 01:27:35.150
<v Speaker 5>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll quickly cut the head off my sis</v>

2059
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:39.400
<v Speaker 5>and take their oil and he'll stop</v>
<v Speaker 5>illegal immigration by building a wall</v>

2060
01:27:39.401 --> 01:27:42.520
<v Speaker 5>on our southern border that Mexico will</v>
<v Speaker 5>pay for it.</v>

2061

<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 4>side cause I think he'll crush her.</v>

2074

<v Speaker 4>I don't think he's one of the young</v>
<v Speaker 4>Earth Christians,</v>

<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2098
01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:24.510
<v Speaker 4>Which means dinosaurs and people were in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same area.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Walking.</v>

<v Speaker 4>make for,</v>

2105
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:37.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>carbon footprinting things cause that's</v>

<v Speaker 4>he's always been a loser.</v>

2111
01:29:46.650 --> 01:29:49.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm waiting for the day when no one runs</v>
<v Speaker 4>for president.</v>

2112
01:29:49.230 --> 01:29:52.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm waiting for the day where the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking roster everybody gives up.</v>

2113
01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:56.490
<v Speaker 4>It's like as soon as we can read minds</v>
<v Speaker 4>and figure out exactly what people,</v>

2114
01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:58.560
<v Speaker 4>what their intention is and what their</v>
<v Speaker 4>past is,</v>

2115
01:29:58.561 --> 01:30:01.470
<v Speaker 4>and you have to sign up for the mind</v>
<v Speaker 4>reading machine in order for to be</v>

2116
01:30:01.471 --> 01:30:03.360
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be the end.</v>

2119
01:30:09.631 --> 01:30:11.580
<v Speaker 4>differently now at this age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I see people,</v>

2123
01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:21.570
<v Speaker 4>to want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to go through that to be the president.</v>

2124
01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:25.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obama's publicly stated that it's not</v>

2125
01:30:25.141 --> 01:30:27.300
<v Speaker 4>what he thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then all these people that are</v>

2126
01:30:27.301 --> 01:30:31.680
<v Speaker 4>lining up to do it like Filson the fame</v>
<v Speaker 4>wears off as what he said and that</v>

2127
01:30:31.681 --> 01:30:35.850
<v Speaker 4>people criticized him by taking that</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote out of context and showing a bunch</v>

2128
01:30:35.851 --> 01:30:38.230
<v Speaker 4>of pictures of him with famous people</v>

<v Speaker 4>The president's vacations cost a ton.</v>

2134
01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:52.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course they will.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

<v Speaker 4>House,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been $70 million.</v>

2141
01:31:06.710 --> 01:31:10.580
<v Speaker 4>Taxpayers had to pay a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a little pricey.</v>

2142
01:31:10.581 --> 01:31:11.414
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's great.</v>

2143
01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.830
<v Speaker 4>It is a little pricey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2144
01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.930
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of trumped up man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a great time on that trip number.</v>

2145
01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:18.990
<v Speaker 4>Often he was golfing 70 million.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not a trip we took.</v>

2146
01:31:19.190 --> 01:31:22.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was golfing like when the San</v>

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:26.650
<v Speaker 4>Bernandino murders were taking place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he went golfing out.</v>

2148
01:31:26.670 --> 01:31:28.980
<v Speaker 4>There was a little skinny legs picking</v>
<v Speaker 4>up golf balls.</v>

2149
01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:30.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't do any squats do.</v>

<v Speaker 4>give me a second.</v>

2152
01:31:34.290 --> 01:31:36.870

<v Speaker 4>Can you be president?</v>

2153
01:31:37.230 --> 01:31:39.840
<v Speaker 4>There's two things you can't be if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to be president.</v>

2154
01:31:40.050 --> 01:31:42.840
<v Speaker 4>You can't be someone who doesn't believe</v>
<v Speaker 4>in God when you can't be someone who</v>

2155
01:31:42.841 --> 01:31:44.670
<v Speaker 4>doesn't play golf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2156
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:46.920
<v Speaker 4>I think we're about to see maybe a</v>
<v Speaker 4>change of that.</v>

2159
01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:53.280
<v Speaker 4>do you think if he won he would play?</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

2160
01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:56.940
<v Speaker 4>I'll make golf illegal and I'll turn off</v>
<v Speaker 4>the place of intense places where the</v>

<v Speaker 4>social justice warriors are always</v>

2183
01:32:46.721 --> 01:32:50.770
<v Speaker 4>saying that you should ask people what</v>
<v Speaker 4>their correct gender pronouns are</v>

2184
01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:55.980
<v Speaker 4>because some people like to useZ and h I</v>

<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the worst thing I've ever heard.</v>

2191
01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:24.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm having an aneurysm right now</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about where this is going to</v>

2192
01:33:24.191 --> 01:33:28.710
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See your pay attention to throat,</v>

2193
01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:33.400
<v Speaker 4>zillow</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm paying attention to ridiculous</v>

2194
01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:38.460
<v Speaker 4>social requirements that people in</v>
<v Speaker 4>college today or we're asking people to</v>

2195
01:33:38.471 --> 01:33:42.280
<v Speaker 4>do and they want people to ask other</v>
<v Speaker 4>people's social,</v>

2196
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.971
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2197
01:33:42.971 --> 01:33:46.990
<v Speaker 4>like they have like this real rigid idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>of how you supposed to behave socially</v>

2198
01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:49.600
<v Speaker 4>and you're supposed to ask their</v>
<v Speaker 4>preferred gender pronouns.</v>

2199
01:33:49.810 --> 01:33:52.900
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't just assume that you are a man.</v>

2200
01:33:53.230 --> 01:33:55.330
<v Speaker 4>I have to ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not kidding.</v>

2201
01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:56.740
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a guy,</v>

2202
01:33:56.741 --> 01:34:00.460
<v Speaker 4>we had this guy on who was a guest who</v>
<v Speaker 4>said that one of his colleagues was,</v>

2203
01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:04.390
<v Speaker 4>I think it was fired because he refused</v>
<v Speaker 4>to this.</v>

2204
01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:08.710
<v Speaker 4>He had a student in his class that would</v>
<v Speaker 4>change his gender pronoun from him to</v>

2205
01:34:08.711 --> 01:34:11.230
<v Speaker 4>her and her to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it would go back forth,</v>

2206
01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:13.960
<v Speaker 4>back and forth depending on what days of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the week.</v>

2207
01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.170
<v Speaker 4>Like some days he wanted to be a girl</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some days he wanted to be a boy.</v>

2208
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:19.300
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this professor was not willing to do</v>

2209
01:34:19.301 --> 01:34:20.560
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he was fired.</v>

2210
01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:23.260
<v Speaker 4>Good for the professor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one where I a hundred percent</v>

2211
01:34:23.261 --> 01:34:26.500
<v Speaker 4>support.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're going back and forth on today,</v>

2212
01:34:26.501 --> 01:34:30.520
<v Speaker 4>she is here and tomorrow he might be</v>
<v Speaker 4>back tomorrow.</v>

2213
01:34:30.521 --> 01:34:33.280
<v Speaker 4>I'mZ ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not her z.</v>

2214
01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:36.580
<v Speaker 4>And then the next day I'm hr her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2215
01:34:36.690 --> 01:34:38.100

2217
01:34:42.671 --> 01:34:46.960
<v Speaker 4>gender pronouns and so they sent it home</v>
<v Speaker 4>with people to like,</v>

2218
01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:52.380
<v Speaker 4>I want you to be aware of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>potential gender pronouns and gender</v>

<v Speaker 4>neutral pronouns that you should be</v>
<v Speaker 4>aware of that people want them to use.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I sucked at tee ball or the ball sits on</v>

2308
01:38:06.421 --> 01:38:09.840
<v Speaker 1>the t and it doesn't move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had trouble with that.</v>

2309
01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:11.460
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't hold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing they do with</v>

2310
01:38:11.461 --> 01:38:13.230
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they can't hit the pitch,</v>

2311
01:38:13.231 --> 01:38:14.700
<v Speaker 1>they gave him a couple of pitches and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't hit it.</v>

2312
01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Then they put it on a little stick and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they let the,</v>

2313
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:19.860
<v Speaker 1>they set it up for them and they hit it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they get them on base for sure.</v>

2314
01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of them,</v>

2315
01:38:21.070 --> 01:38:23.370
<v Speaker 1>they don't mean hit the fucking stealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the ball.</v>

2316
01:38:23.490 --> 01:38:26.400
<v Speaker 1>They hit the stick itself and the ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>falls down and they just start running</v>

2317
01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:29.750
<v Speaker 1>like they just won the world series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2319
01:38:32.190 --> 01:38:33.510
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suck at this shit.</v>

2320
01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:34.260
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2321
01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:37.260
<v Speaker 1>I was bad at every sport until I did</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts.</v>

2322
01:38:37.261 --> 01:38:39.810
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty okay at baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2323
01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:44.100
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't a good baseball player because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't listen to the coach ever.</v>

2324
01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:46.170
<v Speaker 1>They would say go on there and try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit a single.</v>

2325
01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

2326
01:38:47.490 --> 01:38:49.810
<v Speaker 1>And I get up to home run every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2327
01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swing for the bleachers.</v>

2328
01:38:52.110 --> 01:38:54.510
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I hit a couple of them and it was</v>

2329
01:38:54.511 --> 01:38:55.500
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best,</v>

2330
01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:59.640
<v Speaker 1>when you feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take that crack of the bat and that ball</v>

2331
01:38:59.641 --> 01:39:01.350
<v Speaker 1>starts flying through the air,</v>

<v Speaker 1>when you hit a home run course.</v>

2334
01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:11.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't get that feeling when you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>on base.</v>

2335
01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:12.570
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2423
01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:41.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm still got a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2424
01:43:41.761 --> 01:43:43.250
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2425
01:43:43.290 --> 01:43:44.910
<v Speaker 1>is Jeff still in it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's still in it.</v>

2426
01:43:44.970 --> 01:43:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I think jeb is land back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my thought.</v>

2427
01:43:48.090 --> 01:43:51.830
<v Speaker 1>My thought is jeb is rope a dope and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's letting all these people beat each</v>

2428
01:43:51.831 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 1>other</v>

2429
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:56.780
<v Speaker 4>up and he's laying way back and I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to be the eventual Republican</v>

2430
01:43:56.781 --> 01:43:58.140
<v Speaker 4>nominee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly.</v>

2431
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:59.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't meet.</v>

2432
01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:00.830
<v Speaker 4>His numbers are terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't they?</v>

2433
01:44:00.831 --> 01:44:01.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2434
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:03.680
<v Speaker 4>And he's not trying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not trying to do anything about it.</v>

2435
01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:05.480
<v Speaker 4>It's got a long way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2436
01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:07.280
<v Speaker 4>November.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2437
01:44:07.730 --> 01:44:11.930
<v Speaker 4>Which is almost a year from now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about what can happen publicly in</v>

2438
01:44:11.931 --> 01:44:13.070
<v Speaker 4>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a year.</v>

2439
01:44:13.071 --> 01:44:16.970
<v Speaker 4>People become superstars from no name to</v>
<v Speaker 4>superstars in this world.</v>

2440
01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:18.840
<v Speaker 4>The world we're experiencing today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2441
01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:21.110
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a different world.</v>

2442
01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:25.670
<v Speaker 4>Like you gotta be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you're a media savvy guy,</v>

2443
01:44:25.730 --> 01:44:28.970
<v Speaker 4>and I got to assume that anybody who</v>
<v Speaker 4>grows up where his fucking dad was</v>

2444
01:44:28.971 --> 01:44:31.760
<v Speaker 4>president and his brother was president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boy,</v>

2445
01:44:31.761 --> 01:44:35.030
<v Speaker 4>if anybody understands that business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's him and Hillary.</v>

2446
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:37.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looks so tired.</v>

2447
01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:40.760
<v Speaker 4>She looks like she's exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She looks exhausted.</v>

2448
01:44:40.761 --> 01:44:42.770
<v Speaker 4>She looks super unhealthy.</v>

2449
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:44.390
<v Speaker 4>Here's a thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ready?</v>

2450
01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:51.160
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Christie Brinkley or essentially the</v>

2451
01:44:51.771 --> 01:44:54.380
<v Speaker 4>same age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they,</v>

2452
01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:56.570
<v Speaker 4>aren't they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>

2453
01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:59.090
<v Speaker 4>I bet they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet they're fucking clothes.</v>

2454
01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:01.250
<v Speaker 4>Who would you rather hookup with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hillary?</v>

2455
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:02.390
<v Speaker 4>Just for the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2456
01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:03.140
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

2457
01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:04.310
<v Speaker 4>Christie Brinkley.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2458
01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:05.930
<v Speaker 4>so you're gonna Marie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your Bro.</v>

2459
01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:07.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the hillary like,</v>

2460
01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:09.070
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what were you thinking dude?</v>

2461
01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:14.160
<v Speaker 4>Christie Brinkley</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck had Viagara in me.</v>

2462
01:45:15.230 --> 01:45:18.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did 200 milligrams of Viagara.</v>

2463
01:45:18.170 --> 01:45:21.290
<v Speaker 4>I did 10 lines of coke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I drank a bottle of Tequila.</v>

2464
01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:25.670
<v Speaker 4>I was on ecstasy and mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>

2465
01:45:25.730 --> 01:45:29.180
<v Speaker 4>she's had a real dog too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so she's had some savage sex,</v>

2466
01:45:29.181 --> 01:45:29.721
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2467
01:45:29.721 --> 01:45:30.710
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2468
01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:32.630
<v Speaker 4>She probably hasn't been fucked in</v>
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>

2469
01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:35.480
<v Speaker 4>That's probably been a lesbian for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>left 30 or 40 years.</v>

2470
01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:37.520
<v Speaker 4>At least.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just hangs in there with them.</v>

2471
01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:41.150
<v Speaker 4>They made a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they made a deal.</v>

2472
01:45:41.150 --> 01:45:42.470
<v Speaker 4>She just take a picture to get a might</v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

2473
01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:44.030
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talking Shit.</v>

2474
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:47.990
<v Speaker 4>But I got to assume at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

2475
01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:50.390
<v Speaker 4>if you got a guy like bill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get to know him.</v>

2476
01:45:50.391 --> 01:45:52.880
<v Speaker 4>You know that dude's a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a whip.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2478
01:45:54.770 --> 01:45:55.970
<v Speaker 4>He's one of those guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

01:45:55.971 --> 01:45:57.420
<v Speaker 4>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

2480
01:45:58.110 --> 01:45:59.320
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my Dick.</v>

2481
01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:00.920
<v Speaker 4>Belongs in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that,</v>

2482
01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:03.440
<v Speaker 4>Christie Brinkley.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

2483
01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:06.440
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now look at how,</v>

2484
01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:10.730
<v Speaker 4>but that's a a really good picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a really good picture of Hillary</v>

2485
01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:11.564
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>

2486
01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:13.450
<v Speaker 4>There's some horrific pictures of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary.</v>

2487
01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:16.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can find some monstrous ones.</v>

2488
01:46:16.130 --> 01:46:20.120
<v Speaker 4>That's probably from about 30 40 years</v>
<v Speaker 4>ago to how long ago was that picture?</v>

2489
01:46:20.670 --> 01:46:25.520
<v Speaker 4>It's November 21st two months old lies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's photoshop.</v>

2490
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:26.870
<v Speaker 4>The same people that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2491
01:46:26.910 --> 01:46:29.310
<v Speaker 4>the girls are on Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they use that.</v>

2492
01:46:29.370 --> 01:46:32.660
<v Speaker 4>She's listed as 68 and Christie</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brinkley's 61 so seven years,</v>

2493
01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:33.890
<v Speaker 4>seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

2494
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:36.770
<v Speaker 4>There's no way the Christie brick is</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to look that bad in seven years,</v>

2495
01:46:38.610 --> 01:46:42.200
<v Speaker 4>but go for a better picture because it</v>
<v Speaker 4>can happen for her.</v>

2496
01:46:42.230 --> 01:46:43.520
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at her face right there.</v>

2497
01:46:44.350 --> 01:46:46.250
<v Speaker 4>Get the fuck Outta here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2498
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:49.650
<v Speaker 4>She's hot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she's also genetically gifted.</v>

2499
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:51.450
<v Speaker 4>You know that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

2500
01:46:51.451 --> 01:46:56.451
<v Speaker 4>that's her gift to look like that Eo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meaning there's a lot involved.</v>

2501
01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:01.620
<v Speaker 4>It's not just genetics involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She certainly was genetically gifted at</v>

2502
01:47:01.621 --> 01:47:05.280
<v Speaker 4>the jump to have that bone structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2503
01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:07.650
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot involved there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

2504
01:47:07.651 --> 01:47:10.470
<v Speaker 4>there's massive exercise diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2505
01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:14.010
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gotta be some Botox and some cautious</v>

2506
01:47:14.011 --> 01:47:15.930
<v Speaker 4>use of fillers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kegels.</v>

2507
01:47:16.050 --> 01:47:17.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that one right there.</v>

2508
01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:18.533
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on man.</v>

2509
01:47:18.570 --> 01:47:20.350
<v Speaker 4>That's a hot 35 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2510
01:47:20.570 --> 01:47:22.110
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is that possible?</v>

2511
01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:24.510
<v Speaker 4>How is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

2512
01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:27.330
<v Speaker 4>Why aren't her teeth rotting out of her</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking head or those,</v>

2513
01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:31.590
<v Speaker 4>they can't be real teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those teeth are made out of ivory.</v>

2514
01:47:31.591 --> 01:47:33.060
<v Speaker 4>From murdered elephants.</v>

2515
01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:37.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had real teeth.</v>

2516
01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:40.260
<v Speaker 4>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking up my grandmother died when she</v>

2517
01:47:40.261 --> 01:47:43.500
<v Speaker 4>was like 64 and her teeth looked like</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

2518
01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:45.990
<v Speaker 4>Why is she so hot?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate the effort too.</v>

2519
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.740
<v Speaker 4>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her forehead would not move if you had a</v>

2520
01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:52.560
<v Speaker 4>hundred Mexicans and six trucks trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to move it.</v>

2521
01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:56.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all the moving trucks in the world.</v>

2522
01:47:56.051 --> 01:47:57.840
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to make that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>forehead move.</v>

2523
01:47:57.841 --> 01:48:00.780
<v Speaker 4>That thing is frozen in time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a,</v>

2524
01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:03.390
<v Speaker 4>like a bully.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mammoth trapped underneath a glacier.</v>

2525
01:48:06.590 --> 01:48:08.970
<v Speaker 4>Nothing's moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at it fucking for you.</v>

2526
01:48:08.971 --> 01:48:10.080
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She didn't moving.</v>

2527
01:48:10.290 --> 01:48:12.990
<v Speaker 4>She barely has some lines in the corner</v>
<v Speaker 4>of her eyes.</v>

2528
01:48:12.991 --> 01:48:14.910
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's hot as fuck though.</v>

2529
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever she's doing,</v>

2530
01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:19.410
<v Speaker 4>everyone should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should all do it and by the way,</v>

2531
01:48:19.590 --> 01:48:22.650
<v Speaker 4>this is what we're seeing from this rare</v>
<v Speaker 4>of rare,</v>

2532
01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:26.760
<v Speaker 4>about 1% of the one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then of the one I sent this is,</v>

2533
01:48:26.810 --> 01:48:30.840
<v Speaker 4>she is the rarest of the rare when it</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to like women in their sixties</v>

2534
01:48:30.841 --> 01:48:32.040
<v Speaker 4>that are still hot as fuck.</v>

2535
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:34.620
<v Speaker 4>She's 100% hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2536
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:37.710
<v Speaker 4>That is what women are going to look</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's like sort of a fake version of</v>
<v Speaker 4>survivor man with two dudes.</v>

2579
01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:29.800

2580
01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:32.170
<v Speaker 4>expert,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I use air quotes for that,</v>

2581
01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:34.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure he's an expert,</v>

<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think his name is cody and he's</v>

2583
01:50:36.311 --> 01:50:39.400
<v Speaker 4>completely crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't wear shoes ever,</v>

2584
01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:42.580
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he goes through the jungle,</v>

2585
01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:45.880
<v Speaker 4>one or two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the jungle barefoot and his feet are a</v>

2586
01:50:45.881 --> 01:50:50.881
<v Speaker 4>fucking atrocity to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there have to be a crime against nature.</v>

2588
01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:56.530
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's just developed these insanely</v>

2589
01:50:56.531 --> 01:51:00.640
<v Speaker 4>thick calluses on his feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like his photos of his feet online.</v>

2592
01:51:06.730 --> 01:51:11.290

<v Speaker 4>look like when they get close up on like</v>

2593
01:51:11.291 --> 01:51:15.370
<v Speaker 4>the bottoms of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen some horrific photos of what</v>

2594
01:51:15.371 --> 01:51:20.371
<v Speaker 4>his feet looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he just walks everywhere through the</v>

01:51:20.621 --> 01:51:21.850
<v Speaker 4>jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's this huge,</v>

<v Speaker 4>skin fee.</v>

<v Speaker 4>God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2602
01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:46.800
<v Speaker 4>well that's what people did for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is weird that we have clothes and</v>

2603
01:51:47.051 --> 01:51:47.950
<v Speaker 4>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 4>We have no idea about the same size dick</v>

2628
01:52:50.561 --> 01:52:55.561
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His body proportion wise about lines up.</v>

2629
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:59.170
<v Speaker 4>You imagine if your son was born with</v>
<v Speaker 4>just said giant hard.</v>

2630
01:52:59.180 --> 01:53:01.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he comes out and he's,</v>

01:53:01.521 --> 01:53:03.680
<v Speaker 4>why is he up to and bill?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

2632
01:53:03.681 --> 01:53:05.670
<v Speaker 4>that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To his</v>

2633
01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:08.280
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a baby.</v>

2634
01:53:08.281 --> 01:53:13.281
<v Speaker 4>It's hard every day the balls look big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How big their body such so small,</v>

2635
01:53:14.751 --> 01:53:19.751
<v Speaker 4>the babies and then you just see like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>ball bag that stands out for half side</v>

2636
01:53:20.291 --> 01:53:22.910
<v Speaker 4>the size of the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know that the size of the</v>

2637
01:53:22.911 --> 01:53:27.860
<v Speaker 4>testicles is directly proportionate to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of promiscuous women who are</v>

2638
01:53:27.861 --> 01:53:29.390
<v Speaker 4>in the area?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2639
01:53:29.391 --> 01:53:31.820
<v Speaker 4>there's some fucking sluts where I live</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause he's,</v>

2640
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:36.230
<v Speaker 4>he's got a big balls on them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they actually say that the human</v>

2641
01:53:36.231 --> 01:53:40.490
<v Speaker 4>body adapts to the amount of promiscuous</v>
<v Speaker 4>women that are in the area and your</v>

2642
01:53:40.491 --> 01:53:41.660
<v Speaker 4>balls so crazy.</v>

2643
01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:45.560
<v Speaker 4>It's how it is with primates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The more promiscuous the women are in</v>

2644
01:53:45.561 --> 01:53:48.770
<v Speaker 4>the area of the larger the testicles are</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the primate.</v>

2645
01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:52.580
<v Speaker 4>That's why chimps have giant balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But gorillas have little tiny balls,</v>

2646
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:55.910
<v Speaker 4>little tiny balls and little tiny dicks</v>
<v Speaker 4>for chimps,</v>

2647
01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:57.260
<v Speaker 4>for gorillas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for gorillas.</v>

2648
01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:58.550
<v Speaker 4>Because chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chimp,</v>

2649
01:53:58.551 --> 01:54:01.220
<v Speaker 4>women are hookers right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just sluts.</v>

2650
01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:04.580
<v Speaker 4>But gorilla women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they mind their PS and qs if fucking</v>

2651
01:54:04.581 --> 01:54:05.750
<v Speaker 4>keep it in line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2652
01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:11.220
<v Speaker 4>The gorilla has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right gorilla has a Harem.</v>

2653
01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:15.860
<v Speaker 4>He's got a Harem big fucking pile of</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitches and it just sticks his little</v>

2654
01:54:15.861 --> 01:54:20.540
<v Speaker 4>tiny digging them</v>
<v Speaker 4>to champion the chimp.</v>

2655
01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:22.670
<v Speaker 4>They just fuck everybody fucks</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>

2656
01:54:22.671 --> 01:54:24.150
<v Speaker 4>And when you're not looking at me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>funny,</v>

2657
01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:28.250
<v Speaker 4>the super slutty but knows they must</v>
<v Speaker 4>have some giant dicks.</v>

2658
01:54:28.251 --> 01:54:29.150
<v Speaker 4>Giant balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2659
01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:30.350
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're balls.</v>

2660
01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:33.860
<v Speaker 4>Chimp balls are giant and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason why they're giant.</v>

2661
01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:37.190
<v Speaker 4>But they ha they have observed that in</v>
<v Speaker 4>humans,</v>

2662
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:39.580
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the dirt,</v>

2663
01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:44.620
<v Speaker 4>there's a direct relation to the size of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the testicles because the more sluts</v>

2664
01:54:45.321 --> 01:54:48.110
<v Speaker 4>they're on the area,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more competition there is to get</v>

2665
01:54:48.111 --> 01:54:51.020
<v Speaker 4>your sperm and so you have to produce</v>
<v Speaker 4>more sperm.</v>

2666
01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:53.630
<v Speaker 4>So you have to have larger balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2667
01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:55.710
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's something man,</v>

2668
01:54:55.970 --> 01:54:58.370
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nuts and primates,</v>

2669
01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:01.130
<v Speaker 4>there's a direct connection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They used to think that there was</v>

2670
01:55:01.131 --> 01:55:04.760
<v Speaker 4>different kinds of sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a book written called sperm</v>

2671
01:55:04.761 --> 01:55:07.430
<v Speaker 4>wars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's been largely disproven.</v>

2672
01:55:07.431 --> 01:55:10.160
<v Speaker 4>And the idea behind that book was that</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's different kinds of sperm.</v>

2673
01:55:10.161 --> 01:55:13.160
<v Speaker 4>This actual sperm that attack other</v>
<v Speaker 4>sperm,</v>

2674
01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:15.320
<v Speaker 4>they go in there and the attack others</v>
<v Speaker 4>perm,</v>

2675
01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:19.550
<v Speaker 4>that turns out to not be true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no evidence that sperm have any</v>

2676
01:55:19.551 --> 01:55:23.030
<v Speaker 4>other duty other than coming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2677
01:55:23.570 --> 01:55:25.820
<v Speaker 4>hitting eggs and trying to get people</v>
<v Speaker 4>pregnant.</v>

2678
01:55:26.150 --> 01:55:28.760
<v Speaker 4>They don't have any other properties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't actually kill.</v>

2679
01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:30.710
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like a good premise for a movie</v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

2680
01:55:30.810 --> 01:55:33.260
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like an awesome promise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Killer Jews.</v>

2681
01:55:33.261 --> 01:55:34.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she went blind.</v>

2682
01:55:34.611 --> 01:55:36.840
<v Speaker 4>She got the killer as in her eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No sperm.</v>

2683
01:55:36.850 --> 01:55:37.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2684
01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:38.300
<v Speaker 4>Like it.</v>

2685
01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:41.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you like around a lot of promiscuous</v>

2686
01:55:41.331 --> 01:55:42.830
<v Speaker 4>women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like on a porn set,</v>

2687
01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:46.710
<v Speaker 4>then that ges that gets in a girl's eyes</v>
<v Speaker 4>could probably blind her cause it's just</v>

2688
01:55:46.711 --> 01:55:50.940
<v Speaker 4>looking at kill other sperm</v>
<v Speaker 4>burrow into your eye.</v>

2689
01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:56.890
<v Speaker 4>Like little fucking piranhas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's chewing away through this or if</v>

2690
01:55:56.970 --> 01:55:58.430
<v Speaker 4>outer a on one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

2691
01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:03.480
<v Speaker 4>those mugs that it starts bubbling cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's main ones in there like fucking</v>

2692
01:56:05.011 --> 01:56:09.010
<v Speaker 4>feeding frenzy in the Mug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you bet a bunch of guys is in</v>

2693
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:16.400
<v Speaker 4>gang fight in the calm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I don't want to drink it,</v>

2694
01:56:16.401 --> 01:56:19.470
<v Speaker 4>drink it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's frothing like boiling water.</v>

2695
01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:28.200
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever gone fishing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2696
01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:31.310
<v Speaker 4>where there's a feeding frenzy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2697
01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:35.640
<v Speaker 4>yes I have actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in Mexico and it was awesome man,</v>

2698
01:56:35.670 --> 01:56:37.330
<v Speaker 4>because a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took my kids fit,</v>

2699
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:39.090
<v Speaker 4>my kids love fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really fun.</v>

2700
01:56:39.150 --> 01:56:40.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they love it because it's,</v>

2701
01:56:40.621 --> 01:56:43.470
<v Speaker 4>it's fun for little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you can get them like near where</v>

2702
01:56:43.471 --> 01:56:45.370
<v Speaker 4>the fish are and they actually catch</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

2703
01:56:45.371 --> 01:56:48.330
<v Speaker 4>so exciting and then they get to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are so happy.</v>

2704
01:56:48.331 --> 01:56:51.810
<v Speaker 4>Like we caught this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm eating it and we caught it mommy.</v>

2705
01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:54.260
<v Speaker 4>Like they're so excited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we um,</v>

2706
01:56:54.450 --> 01:56:59.100
<v Speaker 4>we went out in Mexico and there was like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hundred yards,</v>

2707
01:56:59.130 --> 01:57:02.630
<v Speaker 4>like a football field size of all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2708
01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:06.690
<v Speaker 4>Jack's like Amber Jacks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess there are skipjacks and they</v>

2709
01:57:06.691 --> 01:57:10.320
<v Speaker 4>were crushing these bait fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they are like anchovies or something</v>

2710
01:57:10.321 --> 01:57:12.420
<v Speaker 4>like that or minnows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2711
01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:17.550
<v Speaker 4>And they're smashing these things and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole like football field size is</v>

2712
01:57:17.551 --> 01:57:22.530
<v Speaker 4>just frothing and all you had to do is</v>
<v Speaker 4>get close to it and cast a lure in</v>

2713
01:57:22.531 --> 01:57:23.364
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2714
01:57:23.490 --> 01:57:24.660
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the girls are like,</v>

2715
01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:29.340
<v Speaker 4>they're holding onto the rod and I have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to hold on to that with them.</v>

2716
01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:31.170
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the fish will literally pull the</v>

2717
01:57:31.171 --> 01:57:33.150
<v Speaker 4>rod in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was wild,</v>

2718
01:57:33.151 --> 01:57:34.410
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's wild.</v>

2719
01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:35.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fishing is a pretty good time.</v>

2720
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.400
<v Speaker 4>I haven't done it in a wild fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

2721
01:57:38.430 --> 01:57:39.510
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Fun,</v>

2722
01:57:39.511 --> 01:57:41.730
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just love the idea that you could go</v>

2723
01:57:41.731 --> 01:57:45.960
<v Speaker 4>out into that water and catch lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just go out of here and bring home</v>

2724
01:57:45.961 --> 01:57:46.794
<v Speaker 4>dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2725
01:57:47.070 --> 01:57:48.390
<v Speaker 4>That's again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a store.</v>

2726
01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:52.110
<v Speaker 4>And if you ever had fish that's caught</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they prepared it for us.</v>

2727
01:57:52.111 --> 01:57:53.700
<v Speaker 4>We caught a couple different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 4>fish.</v>

2728
01:57:53.970 --> 01:57:55.230
<v Speaker 4>We caught a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2729
01:57:55.530 --> 01:57:56.730
<v Speaker 4>when I was in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we call it an,</v>

2730
01:57:56.750 --> 01:57:57.930
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to call it,</v>

2731
01:57:57.931 --> 01:58:01.920
<v Speaker 4>or it's a Wahoo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they call them Ono's and I'm an ono</v>

2732
01:58:01.921 --> 01:58:03.540
<v Speaker 4>is dalicious.</v>

2733
01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:07.020
<v Speaker 4>It's such a delicious fish and the sh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a big fish too.</v>

2734
01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:09.750
<v Speaker 4>So we couldn't have even eaten all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2735
01:58:09.751 --> 01:58:14.610
<v Speaker 4>So I gave half of it to the guy who ran</v>
<v Speaker 4>the boat and then we took half of it.</v>

2736
01:58:15.330 --> 01:58:17.940
<v Speaker 4>Half of the fish was enough for my whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>family.</v>

2737
01:58:18.330 --> 01:58:22.260
<v Speaker 4>Everybody ate it and they ate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They prepared a bunch of different ways.</v>

2738
01:58:22.261 --> 01:58:25.170
<v Speaker 4>They made Sushimi out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They made like a,</v>

2739
01:58:25.230 --> 01:58:28.170
<v Speaker 4>they baked it and they grilled it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they gave us like three different</v>

2740
01:58:28.171 --> 01:58:30.600
<v Speaker 4>preparations and the Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they even made some Vj.</v>

2926
02:05:43.171 --> 02:05:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Netflix paid for a fourth season.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's about these two Seattle homicide</v>

2930
02:05:53.011 --> 02:05:54.690
<v Speaker 1>detectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really good,</v>

2931
02:05:55.050 --> 02:05:56.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>storytelling that the,</v>

2932

<v Speaker 1>per season and they really,</v>

2933
02:06:02.370 --> 02:06:04.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it super engaging.</v>

2934
02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:07.950
<v Speaker 1>It's cliff hanger stuff where it ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like fucking press play on the</v>

2935
02:06:07.951 --> 02:06:09.360
<v Speaker 1>next one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy too?</v>

2936
02:06:09.361 --> 02:06:11.760
<v Speaker 1>They were lease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things where netflix</v>

2937
02:06:11.761 --> 02:06:13.250
<v Speaker 1>figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2938
02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:17.220
<v Speaker 1>They just released the entire season and</v>
<v Speaker 1>won gold course binge watch it.</v>

2939
02:06:17.850 --> 02:06:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the cards.</v>

2940
02:06:19.710 --> 02:06:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had house of cards.</v>

2941
02:06:21.401 --> 02:06:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I watch house of cards too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched one and a half episodes.</v>

2942
02:06:24.181 --> 02:06:26.070
<v Speaker 1>It's all I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I saw it on a plane.</v>

2943
02:06:26.071 --> 02:06:28.200
<v Speaker 1>American Airlines has netflix on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

2944
02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Well that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you.</v>

2945
02:06:30.810 --> 02:06:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I think you get three episodes in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>house of cards.</v>

2946
02:06:34.890 --> 02:06:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Consider it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're done.</v>

2947
02:06:37.260 --> 02:06:39.330
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna Watch the whole fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing if you make it that.</v>

2948
02:06:39.570 --> 02:06:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets better.</v>

2949
02:06:40.771 --> 02:06:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Pilots are tough I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2950
02:06:42.150 --> 02:06:45.840
<v Speaker 1>As the more you watch shows like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand that pilots are tough to</v>

2951
02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:49.290
<v Speaker 1>introduce a world introduced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters make you care about what's</v>

2952
02:06:49.291 --> 02:06:49.940
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

2953
02:06:49.940 --> 02:06:54.390
<v Speaker 1>But once if you can get over that hurdle</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get to the second or third and</v>

2954
02:06:54.391 --> 02:06:55.710
<v Speaker 1>when it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

2955
02:06:55.780 --> 02:07:00.780
<v Speaker 1>bloodline I was totally impressed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>after I got to through a couple episodes</v>

2956
02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:03.270
<v Speaker 1>and Fargo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not a netflix thing,</v>

2957
02:07:03.271 --> 02:07:06.410
<v Speaker 1>but both of those seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the,</v>

2958
02:07:06.630 --> 02:07:11.630
<v Speaker 1>the first season pilot of Fargo is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best pilots I've ever seen.</v>

2959
02:07:14.130 --> 02:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Fargo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never hear about it.</v>

2960
02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:17.650
<v Speaker 1>So fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Willie.</v>

2961
02:07:17.690 --> 02:07:19.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be the best show on</v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

2962
02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Dammit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And then I have a,</v>

3114
02:13:07.670 --> 02:13:09.890
<v Speaker 2>he's going to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's definitely gonna find out.</v>

3115
02:13:09.891 --> 02:13:13.020
<v Speaker 2>It's going to find out I have a Tyson</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson stories in this role.</v>

3116
02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:17.180
<v Speaker 2>That's a great story too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a story about a movie theater</v>

3117
02:13:17.181 --> 02:13:20.450
<v Speaker 2>fight that I got into and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all kinds of stories in it.</v>

3118
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:22.860
<v Speaker 2>I called it mostly stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3119
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:24.560
<v Speaker 2>ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3120
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:26.030
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all going to tell you</v>

3121
02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:28.690
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I d I downloaded one of your,</v>

3122
02:13:28.691 --> 02:13:29.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of your,</v>

3123
02:13:29.981 --> 02:13:32.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cds off itunes.</v>

3124
02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:35.100
<v Speaker 1>I bought one of your comedy cds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks and welcome.</v>

3125
02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:37.710
<v Speaker 1>But there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just in the mood for some comedy</v>

3126
02:13:37.711 --> 02:13:39.360
<v Speaker 1>and I know you're hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was,</v>

3127
02:13:39.361 --> 02:13:41.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was really weird.</v>

3128
02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my phone,</v>

3129
02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:48.300
<v Speaker 1>like when you have Bluetooth synced up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your phone and your phone,</v>

3130
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:50.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it starts when I get in my car,</v>

3131
02:13:50.881 --> 02:13:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the settings are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it does this,</v>

3132
02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:56.250
<v Speaker 1>but my car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just all of a sudden start playing</v>

3133
02:13:56.490 --> 02:13:59.490
<v Speaker 1>like from the mold because it's set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sinked up to Bluetooth and</v>

3134
02:13:59.491 --> 02:14:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Bluetooth for music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I get in my car,</v>

3135
02:14:02.850 --> 02:14:05.010
<v Speaker 1>it'll all of a sudden start playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

3136
02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:09.210
<v Speaker 1>It plays your fucking Serena Williams</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit every time.</v>

3137
02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:11.850
<v Speaker 1>It's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time it plays it first.</v>

3138
02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:14.460
<v Speaker 1>So when I get in my car and I start my</v>
<v Speaker 1>car up,</v>

3139
02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the first thing that I hear every</v>

3140
02:14:17.551 --> 02:14:17.970
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3141
02:14:17.970 --> 02:14:19.530
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as a whole about I,</v>

3142
02:14:19.531 --> 02:14:21.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to die in a dumb way.</v>

3143
02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it goes right into that.</v>

3144
02:14:23.490 --> 02:14:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Every time it's happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it happens to me in my car with a</v>

3145
02:14:27.610 --> 02:14:29.580
<v Speaker 1>gang starr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I guess is probably a better,</v>

3146
02:14:29.581 --> 02:14:34.290
<v Speaker 1>a better than my summary for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better if you got in your car and</v>

3147
02:14:34.291 --> 02:14:36.360
<v Speaker 1>you started playing your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>

3148
02:14:36.370 --> 02:14:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to this pissed,</v>

3149
02:14:37.921 --> 02:14:38.670
<v Speaker 1>pissed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite,</v>

3150
02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:40.560
<v Speaker 1>my favorite shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But actually you knew who else it</v>

3151
02:14:40.561 --> 02:14:43.260
<v Speaker 1>happens too with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with what you're saying is a,</v>

3152
02:14:43.261 --> 02:14:47.550
<v Speaker 1>my mother called me and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought your album and now every time I</v>

3153
02:14:47.551 --> 02:14:50.490
<v Speaker 1>get in the car it plays in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I need to stop it from doing</v>

3154
02:14:50.491 --> 02:14:52.290
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's my own mother.</v>

3155
02:14:52.420 --> 02:14:54.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's fucking sick of this shit.</v>

3156
02:14:54.451 --> 02:14:59.451
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I wonder why song or that</v>
<v Speaker 1>one bit rather plays every time.</v>

3157
02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Every time I get in my car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts off with that.</v>

3158
02:15:04.230 --> 02:15:05.790
<v Speaker 1>That's so it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is weird.</v>

3159
02:15:05.930 --> 02:15:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

3160
02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:11.280
<v Speaker 1>But it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is your gangstarr one that goes,</v>

3161
02:15:11.550 --> 02:15:13.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's above the clouds,</v>

3162
02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:17.160
<v Speaker 1>which makes sense because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alphabetical,</v>

3163
02:15:17.250 --> 02:15:18.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3164
02:15:18.930 --> 02:15:21.240
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But gangstarr but what I mean,</v>

3165
02:15:22.170 --> 02:15:23.400
<v Speaker 1>I dunno man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3166
02:15:23.401 --> 02:15:24.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>

3167
02:15:25.050 --> 02:15:30.050
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes if I plug in the phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it will also only play that song</v>

3168
02:15:30.510 --> 02:15:33.300
<v Speaker 1>and we'll let me fast forward or jumped</v>
<v Speaker 1>to another song.</v>

3169
02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:37.050
<v Speaker 1>What is the name of that and bid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called a good death.</v>

3170
02:15:37.051 --> 02:15:37.591
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3171
02:15:37.591 --> 02:15:38.424
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>

3172
02:15:39.970 --> 02:15:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I just want it to be</v>

3173
02:15:42.690 --> 02:15:45.750
<v Speaker 1>justified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how every fucking day starts for</v>

3174
02:15:45.751 --> 02:15:46.890
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because a,</v>

3175
02:15:47.230 --> 02:15:49.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that must be a mass bay.</v>

3176
02:15:49.470 --> 02:15:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good move.</v>

3177
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:55.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to name all my bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Big Dick Story.</v>

3178
02:15:58.770 --> 02:16:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if that was like what I did with</v>
<v Speaker 1>my special every fucking bit was called</v>

3179
02:16:04.081 --> 02:16:06.390
<v Speaker 1>a big Dick Story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another big Dick.</v>

3180
02:16:06.391 --> 02:16:07.050
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Biggest,</v>

3181
02:16:07.050 --> 02:16:11.430
<v Speaker 1>my favorite big stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had that thing where I,</v>

3182
02:16:11.550 --> 02:16:16.020
<v Speaker 1>that was kind of the idea behind when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did my first album called thrilled where</v>

3183
02:16:16.021 --> 02:16:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I do like a parody of Michael Jackson's</v>
<v Speaker 1>thriller.</v>

3184
02:16:18.930 --> 02:16:22.060
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like part of the fun of that was so that</v>

3185
02:16:22.061 --> 02:16:24.450
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I knew that people who got the</v>

3186
02:16:24.451 --> 02:16:29.130
<v Speaker 1>album had a good chance of in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>library having it next to Michael</v>

3187
02:16:29.130 --> 02:16:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Jackson's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that was,</v>

3188
02:16:30.431 --> 02:16:33.100
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people send me screen grabs,</v>

3189
02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:36.610
<v Speaker 1>they send me screen grabs of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>library.</v>

3190
02:16:36.670 --> 02:16:38.740
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a part of that picture is,</v>

3191
02:16:39.250 --> 02:16:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I love how you trimmed your neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you chest is like a wall between,</v>

3192
02:16:43.961 --> 02:16:47.680
<v Speaker 1>you face your hair and then you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this bridge of no hair.</v>

3193
02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:50.770
<v Speaker 1>So much hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should be the name of my next</v>

3194
02:16:50.771 --> 02:16:52.360
<v Speaker 1>album.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much hair.</v>

3195
02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.810
<v Speaker 1>So people send you screen grabs of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have their phone being like it's you and</v>

3196
02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.850
<v Speaker 1>it's like me and Michael Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3197
02:17:00.970 --> 02:17:02.620
<v Speaker 1>like side by side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thrilled.</v>

3198
02:17:03.130 --> 02:17:07.540
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chest hair in a fucking chain.</v>

3199
02:17:08.350 --> 02:17:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Something about chest hair and chained</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

3200
02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attract a very specific type of woman</v>

3201
02:17:13.001 --> 02:17:14.380
<v Speaker 1>with that look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3202
02:17:14.470 --> 02:17:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Chest hair and chains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3203
02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:20.440
<v Speaker 1>It's the kind that will scoop and score.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that sculpin score.</v>

3204
02:17:20.770 --> 02:17:22.960

<v Speaker 1>Apparently Louis Louis C K is going to</v>

3213
02:17:39.041 --> 02:17:41.080
<v Speaker 1>do an animated series now too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

3214

<v Speaker 1>gingers are fucking run it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what it is.</v>

3218
02:17:45.981 --> 02:17:48.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like a lot of lack of pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're young,</v>

3219
02:17:48.850 --> 02:17:51.310
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That tension builds up.</v>

3220
02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:56.520
<v Speaker 1>You get an upset focus and drive focus</v>
<v Speaker 1>and drive that redheaded focus and</v>

3221
02:17:56.701 --> 02:17:58.810
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's going to do an animated one.</v>

3222
02:17:59.170 --> 02:18:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's apparently going to do an animal.</v>

3223
02:18:00.500 --> 02:18:02.290
<v Speaker 1>You went to animated series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3224
02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:04.600
<v Speaker 1>It's so you could get away with so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3225
02:18:04.601 --> 02:18:08.110
<v Speaker 1>think about what South Park has gotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>away with the stuff that they can do.</v>

3226
02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:10.330
<v Speaker 1>What [inaudible] and butthead dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3227
02:18:10.410 --> 02:18:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3228
02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:15.430
<v Speaker 1>When aren't they gone to Redo Beavis and</v>
<v Speaker 1>butthead?</v>

3229
02:18:15.940 --> 02:18:16.571
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3230
02:18:16.571 --> 02:18:19.570
<v Speaker 1>But nobody cared anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's doing that hbo show.</v>

3231
02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Mike Judd?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3232
02:18:21.130 --> 02:18:22.030
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silicone Valley.</v>

3233
02:18:22.450 --> 02:18:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

3234
02:18:23.390 --> 02:18:24.490
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good show.</v>

3235
02:18:24.910 --> 02:18:28.360
<v Speaker 1>That's another funny show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this the best time ever to be just a</v>

3236
02:18:28.361 --> 02:18:29.110
<v Speaker 1>fucking loser?</v>

3237
02:18:29.110 --> 02:18:31.300
<v Speaker 1>Sits in front of the TV without doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the best,</v>

3238
02:18:31.330 --> 02:18:33.160
<v Speaker 1>best tv shows ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

3239
02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:36.610
<v Speaker 1>TV has for a while now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just leapt over.</v>

3240
02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Moving same cinema.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just not even close.</v>

3241
02:18:39.730 --> 02:18:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about what you can do with a TV</v>

3242
02:18:42.431 --> 02:18:43.001
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3243
02:18:43.001 --> 02:18:46.120
<v Speaker 1>the thing about TV is like something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like game of thrones.</v>

3244
02:18:46.121 --> 02:18:49.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like a new movie every week and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tied together.</v>

3245
02:18:50.050 --> 02:18:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3246
02:18:51.340 --> 02:18:52.570
<v Speaker 1>In a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3247
02:18:52.571 --> 02:18:55.990
<v Speaker 1>how much can you really get attached to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a character in a two hour film?</v>

3248
02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:59.950
<v Speaker 1>It kind of can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not like the way you can't over 10</v>

3249
02:18:59.951 --> 02:19:04.090
<v Speaker 1>1520 episodes season for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew what else I like that these</v>

3250
02:19:04.091 --> 02:19:06.820
<v Speaker 1>television shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's narcos or whether it's game</v>

3251
02:19:06.821 --> 02:19:09.400
<v Speaker 1>of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're largely unknown actors.</v>

3252
02:19:09.430 --> 02:19:13.360
<v Speaker 1>So you associate them with the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>character instead of going,</v>

3253
02:19:13.420 --> 02:19:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's beneath old del Toro playing</v>

3254
02:19:15.641 --> 02:19:16.660
<v Speaker 1>another crazy guy.</v>

3255
02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:17.171
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3256
02:19:17.171 --> 02:19:18.610
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens a lot.</v>

3257
02:19:18.611 --> 02:19:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's big man,</v>

3258
02:19:19.931 --> 02:19:21.940
<v Speaker 1>because when I go to the movies and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>see Tom Cruise,</v>

3259
02:19:21.941 --> 02:19:25.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing Tom fucking cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not seeing some mad scientist.</v>

3260
02:19:25.211 --> 02:19:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not seeing a private agent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no secret agent.</v>

3261
02:19:28.161 --> 02:19:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing Tom Parking cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's famous or Bradley Cooper or</v>

3262
02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Lawrence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing them.</v>

3263
02:19:33.441 --> 02:19:35.240
<v Speaker 1>I know it's them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't lie to me.</v>

3264
02:19:35.470 --> 02:19:39.380
<v Speaker 1>It's why those actors that were really</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really get into play and parts</v>

3265
02:19:39.410 --> 02:19:43.100
<v Speaker 1>stand out so much like the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phillip Seymour Hoffman used to play</v>

3266
02:19:43.101 --> 02:19:45.620
<v Speaker 1>roles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lose yourself in his role because he</v>

3267
02:19:45.621 --> 02:19:49.580
<v Speaker 1>was so committed to not being the actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the park.</v>

3268
02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Day Lewis is my favorite example</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that fucking guy.</v>

3269
02:19:53.271 --> 02:19:57.470
<v Speaker 1>When he did that boxer moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did nothing but box for a year,</v>

3270
02:19:57.920 --> 02:20:01.160
<v Speaker 1>really for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All we did was go to the boxing gym</v>

3271
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:02.390
<v Speaker 1>every day and train.</v>

3272
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:05.510
<v Speaker 1>He looked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the only guy that I've ever seen in</v>

3273
02:20:05.511 --> 02:20:10.280
<v Speaker 1>a movie where he actually looked like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real boxer when he was doing the scenes.</v>

3274
02:20:10.480 --> 02:20:14.930
<v Speaker 1>It was like if you watched the fighter</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Marky Mark Wahlberg and he's</v>

3275
02:20:14.931 --> 02:20:15.860
<v Speaker 1>playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3276
02:20:16.410 --> 02:20:19.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm a tour guide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Micky Ward,</v>

3277
02:20:19.161 --> 02:20:22.060
<v Speaker 1>he playing Micky Ward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't live it.</v>

3278
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Got Boxer and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God knows how to throw punches.</v>

3279
02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Jillian Hall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he looked like a box?</v>

3280
02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:27.380
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3281
02:20:28.410 --> 02:20:32.090
<v Speaker 1>the Marky mark movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't look like a guy who's</v>

3282
02:20:32.091 --> 02:20:34.430
<v Speaker 1>actually been boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like a guy who knows how to</v>

3283
02:20:34.431 --> 02:20:36.800
<v Speaker 1>throw punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a big difference between a</v>

3284
02:20:36.801 --> 02:20:39.890
<v Speaker 1>guy who knows how to throw punches and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who knows how to throw punches,</v>

3285
02:20:39.891 --> 02:20:44.360
<v Speaker 1>anticipating that so many punches back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the idea of an actual boxer,</v>

3286
02:20:44.600 --> 02:20:47.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference between knowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a guy's going to stand in front of</v>

3287
02:20:47.421 --> 02:20:50.690
<v Speaker 1>you like a rocky movie or a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like a boxer.</v>

3288
02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:54.110
<v Speaker 1>And Daniel Day Lewis was the only guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen in a movie that actually</v>

3289
02:20:54.111 --> 02:20:56.480
<v Speaker 1>looked like a boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3290
02:20:56.540 --> 02:20:59.630
<v Speaker 1>this is him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is him jumping rope.</v>

3291
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:02.600
<v Speaker 1>But maybe there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3292
02:21:02.601 --> 02:21:04.210
<v Speaker 1>that's him actually jumping rope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3293
02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Look how good he's jumping rope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

3294
02:21:07.690 --> 02:21:09.020
<v Speaker 1>That shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3295
02:21:09.290 --> 02:21:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's an animal man.</v>

3296
02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:13.250
<v Speaker 1>He really is an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That motherfucker,</v>

3297
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:14.990
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3298
02:21:14.991 --> 02:21:16.130
<v Speaker 1>when he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3299
02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:19.580
<v Speaker 1>my left foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in character like for like a</v>

3300
02:21:19.581 --> 02:21:20.121
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3301
02:21:20.121 --> 02:21:23.900
<v Speaker 1>they said he was like that for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there will be blood stays in character.</v>

3302
02:21:24.050 --> 02:21:25.940
<v Speaker 1>That's probably annoying as fuck it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta be.</v>

3303
02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you do it in a movie like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln and nobody gives a shit.</v>

3304
02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:32.240
<v Speaker 1>How about offset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3305
02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:34.480
<v Speaker 1>lunches or dinner with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3306
02:21:34.590 --> 02:21:37.110
<v Speaker 1>have a milkshake and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

3307
02:21:37.310 --> 02:21:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Hey Ben.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

3308
02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3309
02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:43.010
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna wear on you score.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And seven years ago,</v>

3310
02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:44.780
<v Speaker 1>and nobody gave a fuck about that movie.</v>

3311
02:21:44.930 --> 02:21:49.930
<v Speaker 1>More people cared about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Abraham Lincoln versus the vampire</v>

3312
02:21:50.001 --> 02:21:51.620
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham Lincoln,</v>

3313
02:21:51.621 --> 02:21:54.410
<v Speaker 1>vampire hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More people cared about that movie then.</v>

3314
02:21:54.411 --> 02:21:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Then the Daniel Day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lewis Abraham Lincoln went,</v>

3315
02:21:56.771 --> 02:21:57.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>

3316
02:21:58.010 --> 02:22:00.170
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't give a fuck about historical</v>

3317
02:22:00.171 --> 02:22:01.850
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3318
02:22:01.851 --> 02:22:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they take off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3319
02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:05.660
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it is nameless this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3320
02:22:05.661 --> 02:22:08.440
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it is now is that we</v>

3321
02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:11.720
<v Speaker 1>have seen a lot like there's a point</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you go,</v>

3322
02:22:12.110 --> 02:22:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I know even though it might be worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling,</v>

3323
02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:20.440
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a number of Holocaust movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I've seen a number of civil rights,</v>

3324
02:22:21.380 --> 02:22:24.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American story like so when those come</v>

3325
02:22:24.831 --> 02:22:26.970
<v Speaker 1>out go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of know the story,</v>

3326
02:22:27.150 --> 02:22:28.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's where the,</v>

3327
02:22:28.330 --> 02:22:30.570
<v Speaker 1>the interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the box office goes down and people go,</v>

3328
02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:33.840
<v Speaker 1>well I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this story and you can retell it</v>

3329
02:22:33.930 --> 02:22:36.000
<v Speaker 1>or tell it in a new way or interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

3330
02:22:36.001 --> 02:22:41.001
<v Speaker 1>But people feel like I got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the story does,</v>

3331
02:22:41.250 --> 02:22:45.840
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel like new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was for for a moment it's boring.</v>

3332
02:22:46.410 --> 02:22:48.390
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to hear about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went on to hear about history.</v>

3333
02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:52.920
<v Speaker 1>I want space ships and I want aliens and</v>
<v Speaker 1>laser beams and explosions.</v>

3334
02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Did you say a force awakens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3335
02:22:54.421 --> 02:22:56.660
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think of a date?</v>

3336
02:22:56.790 --> 02:22:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Haven't seen it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should before I tell you everything</v>

3337
02:22:59.881 --> 02:23:00.714
<v Speaker 1>that happened.</v>

3338
02:23:02.970 --> 02:23:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I do want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It captures the essence of the original</v>

3343
02:23:16.111 --> 02:23:19.440
<v Speaker 1>films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with much more updated special</v>

3460
02:27:39.791 --> 02:27:42.430
<v Speaker 1>hair in my mouth,</v>

<v Speaker 1>pubic hair stuck in between your teeth.</v>

02:28:02.591 --> 02:28:04.900
<v Speaker 1>anything else than removing pubic hairs</v>
<v Speaker 1>from your mouth.</v>

3468
02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you bite a Napkin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take a Napkin and bite into it</v>

3469
02:28:09.101 --> 02:28:12.310

<v Speaker 4>how am I going to know the order if I</v>

<v Speaker 4>the saloon door thing.</v>

3511
02:29:56.720 --> 02:30:00.380
<v Speaker 4>So I think people started buying them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They started renting them,</v>

3512
02:30:00.410 --> 02:30:02.000
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they started taking them home and</v>

3513
02:30:02.001 --> 02:30:03.740
<v Speaker 4>then they started going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's all the hair?</v>

3514
02:30:03.840 --> 02:30:05.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then something happened where the</v>

3515
02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:10.400
<v Speaker 4>industry recognized that it's looks</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird when you see all this asshole hair</v>

3516
02:30:10.401 --> 02:30:13.250
<v Speaker 4>and you're good to fucking camera three</v>
<v Speaker 4>inches away from it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>hairy ass and his ball bag or slapping</v>

3518
02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:18.290
<v Speaker 4>up against her area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

3519
02:30:18.291 --> 02:30:19.310
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got to clean this up.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3521
02:30:20.410 --> 02:30:24.080
<v Speaker 4>And so they somewhere along the line</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't on what year it was the eighties</v>

3522
02:30:24.081 --> 02:30:28.430

<v Speaker 4>like ace and had some hair.</v>

3523
02:30:28.460 --> 02:30:31.100
<v Speaker 4>I think it was to me I think it was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>shift in the high def.</v>

3524
02:30:31.550 --> 02:30:33.290
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might be right.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Took the airway well it's also people</v>
<v Speaker 4>got bored with the regular product.</v>

3526
02:30:37.560 --> 02:30:40.820
<v Speaker 4>So we were talking about earlier like</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are they still making porn?</v>

3527
02:30:41.360 --> 02:30:46.360
<v Speaker 4>Well obviously it came a point in time</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they had to shift from just two</v>

3528
02:30:46.431 --> 02:30:50.560
<v Speaker 4>people meeting the pizza guy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>in another one.</v>

02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:57.830
<v Speaker 4>Something happened along the way were</v>
<v Speaker 4>porn itself changed?</v>

3531
02:30:57.831 --> 02:31:01.670
<v Speaker 4>Like they got tired of those scenarios</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it became like rough porn and</v>

3532
02:31:01.730 --> 02:31:04.430
<v Speaker 4>gagging and Mascara running.</v>

02:31:12.140 --> 02:31:17.140
<v Speaker 4>They laid her down on a bed and her head</v>
<v Speaker 4>hung off the edge of the bed and guys</v>

3535
02:31:17.601 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 4>just took turns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just mouth fucking</v>

02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:25.070
<v Speaker 1>are balls into her nose and slobber and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she was like puking up saliva,</v>

3537
02:31:28.561 --> 02:31:33.360
<v Speaker 1>like coughing and spitting and that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>would and they would just be right back</v>

3538
02:31:33.361 --> 02:31:37.020
<v Speaker 1>in there and the next guy would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these guys were these giant cocked</v>

3539
02:31:37.021 --> 02:31:41.940
<v Speaker 1>black guys with these big meaty acids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pound her fucking mouth.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm a vlogger man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3763
02:40:32.341 --> 02:40:35.640
<v Speaker 4>the people started saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me.</v>

3764
02:40:35.880 --> 02:40:38.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm not in support of people saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mind reading out of it.</v>

3765
02:40:38.730 --> 02:40:40.050
<v Speaker 4>I make fun of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And blogging.</v>

3766
02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:42.700
<v Speaker 4>Blogging is a funny term to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3767
02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:44.430
<v Speaker 4>feel weird standing there pointing at</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3768
02:40:44.431 --> 02:40:46.050
<v Speaker 4>You have a handle on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's a gun.</v>

3769
02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:48.990
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had it stick out of the jacket by</v>

3770
02:40:48.991 --> 02:40:51.090
<v Speaker 4>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've seen some people's eyes go.</v>

3771
02:40:51.180 --> 02:40:52.580
<v Speaker 4>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3772
02:40:52.670 --> 02:40:54.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why that and not just a phone,</v>

3773
02:40:55.010 --> 02:40:58.560
<v Speaker 4>cause it seems like a phone would make</v>
<v Speaker 4>it easier to upload the videos just as</v>

3774
02:40:58.561 --> 02:40:59.394
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

3775
02:40:59.430 --> 02:41:02.310
<v Speaker 4>It's not this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this picture quality's got to be better,</v>

3776
02:41:02.730 --> 02:41:04.410
<v Speaker 4>but must better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3777
02:41:04.470 --> 02:41:06.960
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>easier to edit those videos that Tara,</v>

3778
02:41:06.961 --> 02:41:09.460
<v Speaker 4>it's actually not so easy to get that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the video off your iphone.</v>

3779
02:41:09.490 --> 02:41:11.940
<v Speaker 4>You've got to connect it to your thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can just take that card out and</v>

3780
02:41:11.941 --> 02:41:13.720
<v Speaker 4>plugging in your computer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

3781
02:41:14.130 --> 02:41:16.770
<v Speaker 4>It's not like it's super hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a little bit easier to deal</v>

3782
02:41:16.771 --> 02:41:17.431
<v Speaker 4>with those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3783
02:41:17.431 --> 02:41:18.450
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3784
02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:19.081
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3785
02:41:19.081 --> 02:41:21.870
<v Speaker 4>I would think that just having a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's easy.</v>

3786
02:41:21.930 --> 02:41:23.310
<v Speaker 4>I always have a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

3787
02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:26.040
<v Speaker 4>But I think this picture is better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3788
02:41:26.220 --> 02:41:27.090
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it's better.</v>

3789
02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:27.381
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3790
02:41:27.381 --> 02:41:28.890
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that thing sticks out.</v>

3791
02:41:29.550 --> 02:41:30.690
<v Speaker 4>That sticks out the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3792
02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:32.200
<v Speaker 4>the lens sticks out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3793
02:41:32.201 --> 02:41:33.034
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's real.</v>

3794
02:41:33.090 --> 02:41:34.110
<v Speaker 4>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a real shit.</v>

3795
02:41:34.660 --> 02:41:35.670
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll knock it off.</v>

3796
02:41:35.730 --> 02:41:36.181
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3797
02:41:36.181 --> 02:41:37.200
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to knock it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3798
02:41:37.201 --> 02:41:38.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
