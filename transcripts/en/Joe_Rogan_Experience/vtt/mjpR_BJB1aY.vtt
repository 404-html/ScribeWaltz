148
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.120
<v Speaker 1>how many times has there been a big hole slammed into in the earth because a</v>

149
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 1>rock fell from the sky a lot.</v>

150
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:37.901
<v Speaker 1>How many times has youtube been on the Jimmy Fallon shy once you two was on the</v>

151
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.721
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Fallon show?</v>

152
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:41.360
<v Speaker 1>One time ever and it was the first time.</v>

153
00:06:41.361 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 1>There's only one first time ever in the whole universe that you two is going to</v>

154
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 1>be on the Jimmy Fallon show.</v>

155
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.513
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

156
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Unless you believe in true infinity and then that's the monkey wrench because</v>

157
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:57.401
<v Speaker 1>true infinity means if there is a you that the world is what you see.</v>

158
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Everything exists in the exact same form,</v>

159
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.340
<v Speaker 1>not only once but infinitely.</v>

160
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.700
<v Speaker 1>So not only are there so many possibilities in the concept of infinity,</v>

161
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.791
<v Speaker 1>infinity,</v>

162
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:15.260
<v Speaker 1>meaning infinite possibilities,</v>

163
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:16.790
<v Speaker 1>we can't even imagine what that means.</v>

164
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 1>What that means is that everything that you've ever experienced,</v>

165
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 1>everything that I've ever experienced you looking exactly like you,</v>

166
00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:26.150
<v Speaker 1>you looking exactly like you,</v>

167
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.680
<v Speaker 1>you with the same creepy dude,</v>

168
00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 1>he tried to sneak you into the woods to see a fucking large mouth bass.</v>

169
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.990
<v Speaker 1>All of that exists in the exact same order and the exact same form in an</v>

170
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of times.</v>

171
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's how crazy infinity is.</v>

172
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Wrap your fucking head around that.</v>

173
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Like wait a second.</v>

174
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.240
<v Speaker 1>So somewhere out there there is,</v>

175
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.930
<v Speaker 1>it's not just one.</v>

176
00:07:50.931 --> 00:07:51.650
<v Speaker 1>So right now,</v>

177
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.483
<v Speaker 1>right there,</v>

178
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.390
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

179
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.980
<v Speaker 1>you two is playing,</v>

180
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to you.</v>

181
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like you too.</v>

182
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.170
<v Speaker 1>I say it like you shouldn't say it that way,</v>

183
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 1>but youtube right now is probably playing an infinite amount of times all over</v>

184
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:09.410
<v Speaker 1>the universe and at the exact same moment how the exact same moment,</v>

185
00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:12.260
<v Speaker 1>the exact same words are coming out of the exact same mouth.</v>

186
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.050
<v Speaker 1>That experience everything that has ever happened,</v>

187
00:08:15.051 --> 00:08:19.010
<v Speaker 1>the idea of that never happening again on the other side of the world for sure.</v>

188
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.400
<v Speaker 1>The Not in the other side of the world,</v>

189
00:08:20.401 --> 00:08:21.380
<v Speaker 1>but of the universe.</v>

190
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>The idea of everything that has ever happened,</v>

191
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:29.411
<v Speaker 1>being unique in comparison to the creation of the world is so preposterous.</v>

192
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:35.050
<v Speaker 1>The idea that we're so fucking important because we are able to saying it,</v>

193
00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:36.350
<v Speaker 1>capable of talking,</v>

194
00:08:36.351 --> 00:08:38.330
<v Speaker 1>capable of explaining how important we are,</v>

195
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.200
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that we are any weirder than a black hole or a son.</v>

196
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's ridiculous.</v>

197
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:48.500
<v Speaker 1>So the idea of human civilization happening in the exact same order everywhere.</v>

198
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 1>We'd be like,</v>

199
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.150
<v Speaker 1>how is that possible?</v>

200
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.890
<v Speaker 1>But how would it be possible for that?</v>

201
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 1>It'd be other planets that's way crazier and this is a fucking shit ton of those</v>

202
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

203
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.800
<v Speaker 1>How would it be possible that there's water in space?</v>

204
00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

205
00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.753
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of it.</v>

206
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:00.450
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

207
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 1>that's where you've seen when you see a comment stupid,</v>

208
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 1>you seen water flying off the back of that thing.</v>

209
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.153
<v Speaker 1>That's water.</v>

210
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking earth sized chunk of water flying through space.</v>

211
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

212
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

213
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

214
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is nuts.</v>

215
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not nuts that you don't exist.</v>

216
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Not just once,</v>

217
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 1>but an infinite amount of times.</v>

218
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:21.020
<v Speaker 1>That's more likely than a star that's more likely than a black hole.</v>

219
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:26.931
<v Speaker 1>That's more likely than just the idea of people breathing air and staying alive</v>

220
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:31.710
<v Speaker 1>and fish sucking air out of water and some fucking weird contraption called</v>

221
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:32.544
<v Speaker 1>Gills.</v>

222
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 1>That's nuts.</v>

223
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.070
<v Speaker 1>All of it's nuts.</v>

224
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.890
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it exists the same place in the same form all over the the</v>

225
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.650
<v Speaker 1>universe in an infinite amount of times and exactly the same order that seems</v>

226
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 1>like likely you think are nuts.</v>

227
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:47.064
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

228
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.850
<v Speaker 1>That's why when you see a moment like you to on the Jimmy Fallon show singing</v>

229
00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:53.610
<v Speaker 1>that song,</v>

230
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:58.610
<v Speaker 1>like you're witnessing a universal unique moment universal through everything to</v>

231
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.890
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing like that.</v>

232
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.780
<v Speaker 1>That feeling you get when you get goosebumps.</v>

233
00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:05.520
<v Speaker 1>The whole universe got goosebumps for that.</v>

234
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.320
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that you woke up for it.</v>

235
00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:09.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're in tune with that kind of thing.</v>

236
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.541
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

237
00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:10.374
<v Speaker 1>I got lucky.</v>

238
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.650
<v Speaker 1>I drag a lot of coconut water,</v>

239
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 1>tried to get some of that delicious sea two oh coconut water.</v>

240
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I probably had a p most likely,</v>

241
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.161
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not.</v>

242
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:23.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

243
00:10:23.431 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm not convinced that reality is real.</v>

244
00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not convinced you guys were even here.</v>

245
00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

246
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:29.790
<v Speaker 1>We're not,</v>

247
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.320
<v Speaker 1>what does youtube Internet stuff?</v>

248
00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a approximation of it,</v>

249
00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:33.510
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

250
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Cause now we can,</v>

251
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.840
<v Speaker 1>we just watched it again and we were experiencing in a different way.</v>

252
00:10:36.841 --> 00:10:38.550
<v Speaker 1>But that moment has been captured.</v>

253
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.510
<v Speaker 1>We can now repeat itself in our liquor controlled medium.</v>

254
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

255
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's maybe this is us piecing together all these things that you're talking</v>

256
00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:47.310
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

257
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I hope if you see it the first time you see it before I said anything about it</v>

258
00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:52.710
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

259
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:56.640
<v Speaker 1>The last thing I want us to flavor that moment with some my own,</v>

260
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:56.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

261
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:57.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

262
00:10:57.061 --> 00:10:57.301
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

263
00:10:57.301 --> 00:10:58.150
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a,</v>

264
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.640
<v Speaker 1>just a tremendous performance.</v>

265
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.440
<v Speaker 1>If somebody sees it and you hear me talking about it,</v>

266
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.080
<v Speaker 1>shut it off and go watch the real thing.</v>

267
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.221
<v Speaker 1>Don't you know,</v>

268
00:11:05.221 --> 00:11:06.450
<v Speaker 1>if somebody puts it on youtube,</v>

269
00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.120
<v Speaker 1>it might as well be flavors by Joe.</v>

270
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.223
<v Speaker 1>Oh please.</v>

271
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Maybe salt would be better salt,</v>

272
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.320
<v Speaker 1>a little Kumon.</v>

273
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.090
<v Speaker 1>It's really good for you.</v>

274
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.320
<v Speaker 1>It's an anti inflammatory.</v>

275
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.330
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

276
00:11:21.331 --> 00:11:25.590
<v Speaker 1>do you guys feel those moments on stage and realize that you're tapping into</v>

277
00:11:25.591 --> 00:11:26.670
<v Speaker 1>something unique when,</v>

278
00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:27.510
<v Speaker 1>when that happens,</v>

279
00:11:27.511 --> 00:11:29.190
<v Speaker 1>when you hit that that,</v>

280
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

281
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:31.260
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about when we were playing pool,</v>

282
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.860
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes you just hit this weird stride where everything's just fallen</v>

283
00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:38.460
<v Speaker 1>into place and it feels like automatic and you know that there's that moment.</v>

284
00:11:38.461 --> 00:11:39.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's,</v>

285
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.420
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be very similar to the,</v>

286
00:11:43.421 --> 00:11:45.780
<v Speaker 1>the moment like that in comedy with,</v>

287
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.680
<v Speaker 1>with your music,</v>

288
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:49.050
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be moments where you guys are just flowing.</v>

289
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

290
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.300
<v Speaker 1>there was a Disney moment,</v>

291
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make me feel uncomfortable,</v>

292
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 1>but there was a moment where you were on stage and you were saying in,</v>

293
00:11:57.911 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 1>and it was at the December 21st show,</v>

294
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.920
<v Speaker 1>the 2012 end of the world show and both Joey Diaz and Eddie Bravo came offstage</v>

295
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.770
<v Speaker 1>and they both at the same time go.</v>

296
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad ass bitch.</v>

297
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad ass.</v>

298
00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad ass bitch.</v>

299
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo.</v>

300
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.540
<v Speaker 1>That was a bad ass bitch.</v>

301
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:15.221
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

302
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Those motherfuckers are talented in it.</v>

303
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:18.190
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

304
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.230
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad ass bitch.</v>

305
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:19.751
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

306
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:20.740
<v Speaker 1>those guys are talented.</v>

307
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.340
<v Speaker 1>But it was that moment where you know you,</v>

308
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.770
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

309
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.100
<v Speaker 1>we had never done a show with a musical act before and a lot of my friends were</v>

310
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:27.671
<v Speaker 1>skeptical.</v>

311
00:12:27.671 --> 00:12:28.061
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

312
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:28.900
<v Speaker 1>what are you guys going to do?</v>

313
00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Like how's that work together?</v>

314
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.080
<v Speaker 1>How's the wear?</v>

315
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:31.811
<v Speaker 1>So I go,</v>

316
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I think the music probably shouldn't be in the middle cause it would be like,</v>

317
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.610
<v Speaker 1>it would like interrupt the flow of the comedy.</v>

318
00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 1>But I think it would enhance the beginning of the comedy.</v>

319
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:39.730
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

320
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:40.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

321
00:12:40.001 --> 00:12:40.960
<v Speaker 1>so we do it this way.</v>

322
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.220
<v Speaker 1>And so when we,</v>

323
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.190
<v Speaker 1>when we did it and you guys got on stage,</v>

324
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.610
<v Speaker 1>it was the first time that Eddie had ever seen you guys live and uh,</v>

325
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:49.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

326
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.140
<v Speaker 1>he was like Holy Shit,</v>

327
00:12:50.141 --> 00:12:50.920
<v Speaker 1>they're good.</v>

328
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Who's like the lyrics,</v>

329
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:53.051
<v Speaker 1>the fucking,</v>

330
00:12:53.051 --> 00:12:53.930
<v Speaker 1>the music that,</v>

331
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.210
<v Speaker 1>the choices they made.</v>

332
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.190
<v Speaker 1>He just was just like shaking his head.</v>

333
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.510
<v Speaker 1>But I'll never forget that moment where they both walked offstage cause they</v>

334
00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:02.344
<v Speaker 1>were both shaking there.</v>

335
00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

336
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Julian was going to go on stage next and do some standup.</v>

337
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.430
<v Speaker 1>We got so lucky to be involved with this.</v>

338
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Well we're lucky too.</v>

339
00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:11.320
<v Speaker 1>We're all lucky.</v>

340
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:11.760
<v Speaker 1>We're lucky.</v>

341
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

342
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.413
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be,</v>

343
00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.690
<v Speaker 1>this is what the show would be completely uninteresting.</v>

345
00:13:16.691 --> 00:13:18.070
<v Speaker 1>It was just me talking every week.</v>

346
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.380
<v Speaker 1>I need you guys.</v>

347
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.310
<v Speaker 1>I think you have a lot to say and it's very interesting.</v>

348
00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:21.890
<v Speaker 1>People are hurt.</v>

349
00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.080
<v Speaker 1>They've heard it already by now.</v>

350
00:13:23.081 --> 00:13:24.760
<v Speaker 1>I've run out of Shit to say I repeat myself.</v>

351
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't even like listening to me anymore.</v>

352
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:30.590

<v Speaker 1>We're all in on this and some fucking weird way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We're all in on this thing together.</v>

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:38.591

<v Speaker 1>No questions.</v>

388

<v Speaker 1>All literature.</v>

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:26.320
<v Speaker 1>It's all fiction.</v>

00:14:26.321 --> 00:14:27.400
<v Speaker 1>It's coming from the universe.</v>
