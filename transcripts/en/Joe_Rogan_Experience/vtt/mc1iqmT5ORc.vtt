00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak pitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:04.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.350
<v Speaker 1>one of my heroes who's building a health city in the Cayman Islands is named a</v>

4
00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Devy shitty.</v>

5
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>he did create name.</v>

7
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:13.891
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

9
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>he's an Indian guy and he did amazing stuff with,</v>

10
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:18.700
<v Speaker 1>he'll offer Americans,</v>

12
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>heart surgery for one 10th the price with the best doctors and that makes them</v>

14
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:26.490
<v Speaker 1>enough money where he can offer a medical insurance to rural Indians,</v>

15
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>for 25 cents a month.</v>

17
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>So he plays this kind of jurisdictional arbitrage.</v>

18
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>So now he's moving,</v>

19
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.691
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>to the Cayman Islands and building what are called health cities ready to catch</v>

21
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:39.444
<v Speaker 1>the wiving,</v>

22
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>the rising wave of Americans who are going to be dissatisfied with their</v>

23
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>healthcare and when a faster,</v>

24
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>quicker and cheaper.</v>

25
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.310
<v Speaker 1>And we'll fly there.</v>

26
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.773
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

27
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>I've been looking at him as a guy that seems like he understands what</v>

28
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:53.191
<v Speaker 1>seasteading would be.</v>

29
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>He seems to understand the principles and he's applying them by using real</v>

30
00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:57.924
<v Speaker 1>islands.</v>

31
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.480
<v Speaker 1>And I've always fantasized if I could talk to him and get him to like invest in</v>

32
00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:02.314
<v Speaker 1>the cease dead.</v>

33
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.121
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

34
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 1>I almost peed my pants a few months ago where he was in the news and he said,</v>

35
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>the best place to have a floating hospital would be on a ship,</v>

37
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>off the coast of a major American city.</v>

39
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Given that we don't have that,</v>

40
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to build one in the Cayman Islands.</v>

41
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.601
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

42
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:19.290
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

43
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people thinking along these lines.</v>

44
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Like if we could just,</v>

45
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>we have innovations and technologies moving forward and we have regulatory</v>

46
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>structures and government's holding it back and the world can't be held back.</v>

47
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 1>The world has to move forward when you don't want to overthrow governments</v>

48
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:37.014
<v Speaker 1>that's violent.</v>

49
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.200
<v Speaker 1>You want to innovate and compete with an embarrassed governments the way you</v>

50
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>know Singapore and Hong Kong and the island man have done.</v>

51
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.710
<v Speaker 2>Heck,</v>

52
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.471
<v Speaker 2>she was like that too.</v>

53
00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:49.270
<v Speaker 2>I worked with him in Texas.</v>

54
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>

55
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.450

63
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll never be that for,</v>

64
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.190

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.011
<v Speaker 2>This is true story.</v>

121
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 2>his girlfriend just broke up with him.</v>

123
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 2>He was going out with her forever.</v>

124
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 2>So we're in a cab and he said to the cab driver,</v>

125
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:01.350
<v Speaker 2>I want to hooker in tech.</v>

<v Speaker 2>so I made me shivers just thinking about it.</v>

130
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.930
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

131
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 2>so the cab driver's said,</v>

132
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:11.111
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

133

135
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:21.781
<v Speaker 2>He wants to the first house and the lady opened the door and looked at him,</v>

00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

148
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 2>I can't get fucking hookers me 10 minutes the next night.</v>

149
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Just brilliant fucking on hookers.</v>

150
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:47.644
<v Speaker 2>That won't fuck up</v>

151
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.660
<v Speaker 2>in local taxes.</v>

152
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking brilliant.</v>

153
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm going.</v>

154
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.390
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable how fucking good this guy is.</v>

155
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.433
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

156
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 3>the amount of responsibility involved in influencing a young developing mind</v>

157
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.830
<v Speaker 3>can't be under overestimated due.</v>

158
00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:08.720
<v Speaker 3>You have to overcome for remember when you were a kid?</v>

159
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

160
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:09.920
<v Speaker 3>I do like good ones.</v>

161
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.490
<v Speaker 3>Like late,</v>

162
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.010
<v Speaker 3>like the sun in the sky.</v>

163
00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:14.420
<v Speaker 3>You can see any kind of see any star.</v>

164
00:05:14.421 --> 00:05:17.360
<v Speaker 3>I can't see the other teachers in my head for the few good ones that I had.</v>

165
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

166
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.360
<v Speaker 3>What an incredibly,</v>

167
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.160
<v Speaker 3>they could all be like,</v>

168
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.971
<v Speaker 3>obviously it'd be great,</v>

169
00:05:19.971 --> 00:05:21.020
<v Speaker 3>but I mean teach us.</v>

170
00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:21.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

171
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.310
<v Speaker 3>Awesome responsibility.</v>

172
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.641
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

173
00:05:22.641 --> 00:05:23.810
<v Speaker 3>I had some great ones.</v>

174
00:05:23.811 --> 00:05:27.710
<v Speaker 3>I had a few great ones that were just really good people that were smart and</v>

175
00:05:27.711 --> 00:05:29.300
<v Speaker 3>kind and they,</v>

176
00:05:29.301 --> 00:05:29.641
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

177
00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 3>they profoundly,</v>

178
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.010
<v Speaker 3>I had a science teacher in seventh grade that I had a discussion with him,</v>

179
00:05:34.011 --> 00:05:35.660
<v Speaker 3>just me and him one day and I never forgot it.</v>

180
00:05:35.661 --> 00:05:38.750
<v Speaker 3>And we were talking about space and he was a really interesting guy.</v>

181
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.411
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

182
00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:41.600
<v Speaker 3>it was a bad neighborhood we lived in,</v>

183
00:05:41.601 --> 00:05:42.830
<v Speaker 3>I lived in Jamaica plain,</v>

184
00:05:42.831 --> 00:05:43.940
<v Speaker 3>which was like this um,</v>

185
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.390
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood in Boston just outside of um,</v>

186
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:49.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

187
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.791
<v Speaker 3>Boston.</v>

188
00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:52.010
<v Speaker 3>It's just is a real shit neighborhood at the time.</v>

189
00:05:52.011 --> 00:05:53.660
<v Speaker 3>It's become a little bit gentrified now,</v>

190
00:05:53.661 --> 00:05:55.490
<v Speaker 3>but back then it was just really sketchy,</v>

191
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.930
<v Speaker 3>very poor kids.</v>

192
00:05:56.931 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 3>And was a kid that was in my class.</v>

193
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 3>I guess I was seventh grade eight went ninth is a highschool is eighth grade</v>

194
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 3>cause it was right before high school and this kid was 17 years old and the</v>

195
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 3>fucking eighth grade.</v>

196
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.101
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

197
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:08.370
<v Speaker 3>it was crazy cause they were just,</v>

198
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 3>there would be there for the beginning of the year and then they would drop out.</v>

199
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.770
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

200
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 3>this science teacher was,</v>

201
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

202
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 3>in this shit school system,</v>

203
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 3>but he was just genuinely kind,</v>

204
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 3>curious patient man.</v>

205
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.040
<v Speaker 3>And he talked to me about space and,</v>

206
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 3>and I'd never considered the idea that space is never ending.</v>

207
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 3>And he was explaining the concept of infinity to me and that there truly is no</v>

208
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:31.551
<v Speaker 3>boundary.</v>

209
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:32.410
<v Speaker 3>And if you really any,</v>

210
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.021
<v Speaker 3>I remember he said,</v>

211
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 3>do you ever really want to make your head hurt?</v>

212
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.070
<v Speaker 3>Just stare at the sky and try to wrap your head around the idea that it never</v>

213
00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:40.700
<v Speaker 3>ends.</v>

214
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 3>And we had this long conversation about it and Nick Inbetween classes one day,</v>

215
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.471
<v Speaker 3>not even a long,</v>

216
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

217
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.483
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes maybe,</v>

218
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.670
<v Speaker 3>but enough that I,</v>

219
00:06:47.671 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 3>I thought about that for years to this day.</v>

220
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:51.044
<v Speaker 3>I remember that guy.</v>

221
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.543
<v Speaker 4>That's a great,</v>

222
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.590
<v Speaker 4>Richard Fiman was this a physicist?</v>

223
00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:55.490
<v Speaker 4>A fantastic guy.</v>

224
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

225
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.291
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

226
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.490
<v Speaker 4>told about his father that his,</v>

227
00:06:58.491 --> 00:06:58.701
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

228
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.420
<v Speaker 4>he was pulling some wagon and he had balls in the wagon.</v>

229
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.671
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

230
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:01.851
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

231
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 4>it's when you pull the wagon,</v>

232
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 4>the ball stay for a bit,</v>

233
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:05.670
<v Speaker 4>and then they bump up and then you stop the wagon.</v>

234
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.261
<v Speaker 4>They keep going.</v>

235
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 4>So he was talking about momentum and physics and all that.</v>

236
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.430
<v Speaker 4>And so like all kids,</v>

237
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:10.761
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

238
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:10.881
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

239
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:11.091
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>

240
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:11.331
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>

241
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:11.691
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

242
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 4>And then he got to a point with his father where he said,</v>

243
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:15.501
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

244
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:16.100
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

245
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 4>And his father said that nobody knows.</v>

246
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.371
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

247
00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 4>why is there gravity?</v>

248
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean that nobody knows.</v>

249
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

250
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.010
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

251
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 4>I think those kinds of questions where you really stimulate your mind,</v>

252
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.640
<v Speaker 4>I think is a great idea.</v>

253
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.790
<v Speaker 4>I was telling my daughter a couple of,</v>

254
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.030
<v Speaker 4>I made me two months ago about a,</v>

255
00:07:33.031 --> 00:07:34.550
<v Speaker 4>there's an old Spanish proverb that says,</v>

256
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

257
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.360
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

258
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.360
<v Speaker 4>habits begin as cobwebs and end up has chains way easier to break in the</v>

259
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.920
<v Speaker 4>beginning than later off.</v>

260
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.151
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

261
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:41.821
<v Speaker 4>Way To put it.</v>

262
00:07:41.821 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 4>It's a great way to put it.</v>

263
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

264
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:43.880
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

265
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.713
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

266
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.260
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

267
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:45.950
<v Speaker 4>she just,</v>

268
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.940
<v Speaker 4>she just brought this up,</v>

269
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:47.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

270
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.571
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

271
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:48.230
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

272
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.150
<v Speaker 4>that we were talking about someone she knew and,</v>

273
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 4>and something that she didn't like that they did.</v>

274
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:52.971
<v Speaker 4>And she said,</v>

275
00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:53.151
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

276
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:54.980
<v Speaker 4>but that's still pretty much in the cob web phase,</v>

277
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 4>so they can probably still change it at him.</v>

278
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.651
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

279
00:07:57.651 --> 00:07:57.830
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

280
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.431
<v Speaker 4>I even,</v>

281
00:07:58.431 --> 00:07:58.980
<v Speaker 4>I didn't remember.</v>

282
00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

283
00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.571
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

284
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:00.770
<v Speaker 4>the cob webs and change things.</v>

285
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:04.640
<v Speaker 4>Like she really sunk in her and she's like five and she can remember those</v>

286
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 4>things that can really take you through life and give you real clarity.</v>

287
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:08.840
<v Speaker 4>I think that stuff is great,</v>

288
00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 4>and I remember those people who gave me those important lessons as,</v>

289
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:12.680
<v Speaker 4>as a kid.</v>
