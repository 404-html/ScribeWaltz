<v Speaker 1>They had rain and and you know there's </v>

32
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:26.661
<v Speaker 1>also there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were blowing down.</v>

33
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:30.781
<v Speaker 1>The Army Corps of Engineers was blowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>down levies on purpose to flood </v>

34
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:33.430
<v Speaker 1>farmlands weeks ago because they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about this happening.</v>

35
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking essentially picking and </v>

36
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>choosing which places they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we'll help you out.</v>

39
00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:43.060
<v Speaker 1>We're going to blow down the levies over</v>
<v Speaker 1>here so the water would rush out.</v>

40
00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:46.910
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't going towards heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>populated residential area.</v>

41
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.790
<v Speaker 1>It's crests in Memphis now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wow residents are being evacuated in</v>

42
00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:54.160
<v Speaker 1>the city of Memphis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city.</v>

43
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.560
<v Speaker 1>God that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

44
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 1>See the river crest at 48 feet falling </v>
<v Speaker 1>short of.</v>

45
00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>It's all time record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still soaking lie.</v>

46
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Low lying areas have enough water to </v>
<v Speaker 1>require a massive cleanup.</v>

47
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Speaker 1>They're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

48
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Did the crazy thing about something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>

49
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's nothing you can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all that water coming in.</v>

50
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do you gonna build a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new dam all and where's the water going </v>

51
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 1>to go when you dam it up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's it gonna go.</v>

52
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>You got to lake ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you build that too?</v>

53
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.520
<v Speaker 1>You can't do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

54
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>you just have to let it dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rain again.</v>

55
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Little baby existence is so fragile and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we set up these camps next to these </v>

56
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>natural things like rivers and oceans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just assume that while it's been this</v>

57
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:37.011
<v Speaker 1>way for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be this way next year and </v>

58
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:37.011
<v Speaker 1>a good spot to build a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that smart,</v>

59
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>but do you think like when we were in in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wilderness,</v>

60
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:45.291
<v Speaker 1>right and floods happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably just didn't go as close </v>

61
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:45.291
<v Speaker 1>next time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:45.291
<v Speaker 1>They probably over like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

63
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>this is where the water came last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's move back a little bit.</v>

64
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom line is why are they building</v>

65
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>still the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea of living in one place is</v>

66
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:59.511
<v Speaker 1>only a few thousand years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a few thousand years ago we were </v>

67
00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>nomadic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we would do is move</v>

68
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.190
<v Speaker 2>where the animals went would move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where the animals went and then some </v>

69
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 2>asshole figured out seeds and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what fucked everything.</v>

70
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Once I could just get food wherever they</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be,</v>

71
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 2>I say it fucked everything up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I made everything awesome.</v>

72
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:15.091
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck wants to follow around </v>

73
00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:15.091
<v Speaker 2>undulate herds of animals through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking savannah.</v>

74
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

75
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do your podcast because my </v>

76
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 3>family is leaving after a pack of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Buffalo's later on</v>

77
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm going hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting with Ricky Schroder and that's </v>

78
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 2>one of the options to shoot a buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really trying to decide whether or not I</v>

79
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:31.460
<v Speaker 2>want to kill a buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm killing a board with a gun rifle.</v>

80
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat meat,</v>

81
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

82
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I understand if you're an animal lover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>

83
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.940
<v Speaker 2>it's way more cruel to see an animal go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through this whole system of factory </v>

84
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 2>farming and getting hung by their ankles</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get their neck cut and they kick and</v>

85
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 2>spasm some of the shit that you see in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these videos.</v>

86
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these animals have lived shit lives </v>

87
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much of those videos is</v>

88
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 2>just one isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible incident and one terrible place</v>

89
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 2>where they don't follow the rules or if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's widespread,</v>

90
00:03:59.261 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

91
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.700
<v Speaker 2>it's really difficult because neither </v>
<v Speaker 2>side wants to be totally honest about </v>

92
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 2>how fucked up the whole raising animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is.</v>

93
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 2>But it's bad either way it's bad and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to do my best to not eat anything</v>

94
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try.</v>

95
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to stop eating burgers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to stop eating anything that </v>

96
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.770
<v Speaker 2>I think is possibly factory farmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get plenty of organic meat,</v>

97
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 2>like whole foods and shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

98
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

99
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:26.900
<v Speaker 2>they're grass fed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just wandering around and it's a</v>

100
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.380
<v Speaker 2>better experience for the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

101
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 2>I just think that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best way to do it,</v>

102
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:33.720
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Speaker 2>and I've never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

104
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 2>And everybody who does it says it's this</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy fucking primal,</v>

105
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.720
<v Speaker 2>thrilled</v>

106
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.250
<v Speaker 3>brother-in-law kills a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like right around Christmas.</v>

107
00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:46.251
<v Speaker 3>He goes with his buddies every year and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then he kills it and cuts it up and he </v>

108
00:04:46.251 --> 00:04:47.580
<v Speaker 3>keeps me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's big meat locker and he eats venison</v>

109
00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:52.581
<v Speaker 3>all winter long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like every year I'm one of the </v>

110
00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:52.581
<v Speaker 3>spring comes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done with the deer.</v>

111
00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:52.581
<v Speaker 3>You don't get one in the fall?</v>

112
00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you shoot one venison in a one,</v>

113
00:04:54.381 --> 00:04:57.410
<v Speaker 2>one d or rather that venison can last </v>
<v Speaker 2>you for fucking 10 months.</v>

114
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Freeze it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keeping the freezer.</v>

115
00:04:59.181 --> 00:05:04.181
<v Speaker 2>You're good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how long a buffalo will last </v>

116
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:04.181
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I shoot this buffalo,</v>

117
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:04.790
<v Speaker 2>I would have to give some of it away </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think some of you can't really</v>

118
00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:06.440
<v Speaker 2>even freeze them on the off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

119
00:05:06.441 --> 00:05:09.770
<v Speaker 2>because you can't freeze like meat for </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than six months.</v>

120
00:05:09.771 --> 00:05:12.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

121
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.690
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain amount of time.</v>

122
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

123
00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:16.830
<v Speaker 3>I eat chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

124
00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:18.390
<v Speaker 3>how old is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares?</v>

125
00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:20.430
<v Speaker 3>It's frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big piece of ice.</v>

126
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 3>It was random,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like back of your refrigerator or in </v>

127
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.090
<v Speaker 3>your freezer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the freezer.</v>

128
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.290
<v Speaker 3>In the freezer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

129
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:28.620
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

130
00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:33.621
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about those bags of chicken </v>

131
00:05:33.621 --> 00:05:33.621
<v Speaker 3>for $12.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to do that.</v>

132
00:05:33.621 --> 00:05:33.621
<v Speaker 3>I don't need more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>

133
00:05:33.621 --> 00:05:35.580
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done it where you're like,</v>

134
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the expiration dates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>expiration dates scratched off.</v>

135
00:05:39.391 --> 00:05:39.750
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

136
00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:44.751
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's supposed to be really </v>

137
00:05:44.751 --> 00:05:45.360
<v Speaker 3>bad when you free something and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought out and then you refreeze it.</v>

138
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't close.</v>

139
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.580
<v Speaker 3>You've thought out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta eat it.</v>

140
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.550
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think fucking.</v>

141
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.700
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should find that you shouldn't give </v>

142
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.700
<v Speaker 3>up hope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

143
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.560
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's like the nutrients come</v>

144
00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 4>out once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking halfway through that.</v>

145
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

146
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:05.771
<v Speaker 4>that's not sound good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But nutrients can come out once I </v>

147
00:06:05.771 --> 00:06:05.771
<v Speaker 4>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that this straight though.</v>

148
00:06:05.771 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 4>Why is refreezing food bad?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you ever have a question you can </v>

149
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 4>go to the goddamn internet if it will </v>
<v Speaker 4>load up.</v>

150
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know certain things went bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

151
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 4>like Campbell's soup or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or spaghetti sauce tell you to keep that</v>

152
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:20.310
<v Speaker 4>stuff in like panic rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can.</v>

153
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.740
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

154
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:26.741
<v Speaker 4>like I was looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was soup the other day or </v>

155
00:06:26.741 --> 00:06:28.230
<v Speaker 4>maybe with pasta sauce in a glass </v>
<v Speaker 4>container and that's been in the,</v>

156
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.000
<v Speaker 4>in the cupboard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's uh,</v>

157
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was actually an expiration date on</v>

158
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

159
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:34.750
<v Speaker 4>wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think she like,</v>

160
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.960
<v Speaker 4>can Campbell's soup?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Goddammit.</v>

161
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 4>Did I really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe for legal reasons.</v>

162
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.100
<v Speaker 4>Maybe for legal reasons they have to in </v>
<v Speaker 4>case you get sick or something like </v>

163
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.100
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

164
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.100
<v Speaker 4>that'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

165
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.000
<v Speaker 4>See who's calling be great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

166
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.730
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

167
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 4>never killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never shot a gun.</v>

168
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.950
<v Speaker 4>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

169
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.270
<v Speaker 4>not that I recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of scary.</v>

170
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:57.290
<v Speaker 4>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's how,</v>

171
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.320
<v Speaker 4>why I'm scared about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or I'm scared I'm going to get addicted </v>

172
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.320
<v Speaker 4>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to enjoy it a lot and then I'm</v>

173
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.930
<v Speaker 4>going to buy a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

174
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.910
<v Speaker 4>But why are you scared about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

175
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:06.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not me.</v>

176
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.400
<v Speaker 4>It's that I just feel like if you have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>gun in your house,</v>

177
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:11.440
<v Speaker 4>something will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

178
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a gun in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm probably never going to get shot </v>

179
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.430
<v Speaker 4>with a gun in my house talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

180
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Way of thinking.</v>

181
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:24.130
<v Speaker 4>Get a fucking gun to have one and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>needed to needed and not have power </v>

182
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:24.400
<v Speaker 4>saying I've never shot a gun in my lazy.</v>

183
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 4>He pulled the trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom then goes off and I was afraid.</v>

184
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm afraid that I'm going to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>addicted to doing it.</v>

185
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.670
<v Speaker 4>You're not retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

186
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.710
<v Speaker 4>You would be out there sucking Dick for </v>
<v Speaker 4>crack money if you had that kind of a </v>

187
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.710
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

188
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.710
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

189
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna fucking gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was scared to have one one.</v>

190
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:41.170
<v Speaker 4>I used to do a lot of drugs and drink a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot because I thought like,</v>

191
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be emotional and be tripping </v>

192
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull my gun out,</v>

193
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.370
<v Speaker 4>not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I did some stupid,</v>

194
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.410
<v Speaker 4>but now I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still do that.</v>

195
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.660
<v Speaker 4>It's a control issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>

196
00:07:49.661 --> 00:07:50.890
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're worried about your,</v>

197
00:07:50.891 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 4>your own ability to control yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

198
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.550
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of hotheaded motherfuckers</v>
<v Speaker 4>that shouldn't have a gun.</v>

199
00:07:55.551 --> 00:08:00.551
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of people have pulled the </v>

200
00:08:00.551 --> 00:08:01.901
<v Speaker 4>trigger and then realized what they'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>done afterwards and their whole life is </v>

201
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:01.901
<v Speaker 4>ruined.</v>

202
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:01.901
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not that.</v>

203
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm not that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not that.</v>

204
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.830
<v Speaker 4>You would have already had a bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not that guy.</v>

205
00:08:03.831 --> 00:08:04.900
<v Speaker 4>You're that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't.</v>

206
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.430
<v Speaker 4>You've already have a bunch of self </v>
<v Speaker 4>control issues.</v>

207
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.810
<v Speaker 4>This is how I put,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in my brain,</v>

208
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.540
<v Speaker 4>I say if someone broke into my house </v>
<v Speaker 4>with my family there,</v>

209
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:13.600
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether or not I have a gun,</v>

210
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:15.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to want to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try to.</v>

211
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.610
<v Speaker 4>If I don't have a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try.</v>

212
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 4>If they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're attacking my family,</v>

213
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:20.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try to find something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed him.</v>

214
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.030
<v Speaker 4>Heavy gun will probably make that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>easier.</v>

215
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.840
<v Speaker 4>Probably try anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so having a gun shot.</v>

216
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:27.570
<v Speaker 4>Making.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

217
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 4>shotgun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the move.</v>

218
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.330
<v Speaker 4>Or just start collecting Lord of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rings.</v>

219
00:08:30.331 --> 00:08:35.331
<v Speaker 4>Swords to sound good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think you can kill a guy with a </v>

220
00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:39.651
<v Speaker 4>sword?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a Samurai sword that's at my </v>

221
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:39.651
<v Speaker 4>house right now and I've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>practicing.</v>

222
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:42.800
<v Speaker 4>So you're ready.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm ready to do some fucking whatever.</v>

223
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.130
<v Speaker 4>Quintin Tarantino type killing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a fucked up way to kill somebody.</v>

224
00:08:46.131 --> 00:08:51.131
<v Speaker 4>Somebody killed broken to a guy's house </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he got killed them with a Samurai </v>

225
00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:51.131
<v Speaker 4>sword.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a year or two.</v>

226
00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:53.360
<v Speaker 4>He had a Samurai sword that could go </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>

227
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.380
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ed could get.</v>

228
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy could take it from</v>

229
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.280
<v Speaker 1>you and then you could die with your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

230
00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Samurai sword.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

231
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:04.370
<v Speaker 1>that would be the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the worst baseball bats going to </v>

232
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.301
<v Speaker 1>be a bad one to this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy from this website caught up </v>

233

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:04.490
<v Speaker 4>What's funny is those candy cigarettes </v>
<v Speaker 4>has denied that they actually sell them </v>

349
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.431
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they can't call them cigarettes </v>

350
00:14:07.431 --> 00:14:08.991
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they call him like candy sticks are </v>

351
00:14:08.991 --> 00:14:08.991
<v Speaker 4>so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>

352
00:14:08.991 --> 00:14:12.710
<v Speaker 4>So they're a candy stick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when the [inaudible] read like it's </v>

353
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.710
<v Speaker 4>lit,</v>

354
00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:15.530
<v Speaker 1>the ones you used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to put like sugar at the end,</v>

355
00:14:15.531 --> 00:14:17.270
<v Speaker 1>you can blow it and it would blow out </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke.</v>

356
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never had the deluxe one.</v>

357
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did the uh,</v>

358
00:14:20.841 --> 00:14:25.841
<v Speaker 1>the fake cigarettes for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The electronic cigarettes to try to get </v>

359
00:14:25.841 --> 00:14:26.480
<v Speaker 1>off the cigarettes.</v>

360
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it was when they,</v>

361
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.380
<v Speaker 4>when they first were starting to come </v>
<v Speaker 4>over like maybe a year and a half,</v>

362
00:14:31.381 --> 00:14:35.190
<v Speaker 4>two years ago when they first started to</v>
<v Speaker 4>come over here from overseas.</v>

363
00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.790
<v Speaker 4>And so I had this idea like I was gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was doing a lot of reviews,</v>

364
00:14:38.791 --> 00:14:40.470
<v Speaker 4>like tech reviews and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I thought,</v>

365
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.760
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to quit smoking.</v>

366
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.110
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to review this,</v>

367
00:14:43.111 --> 00:14:45.480
<v Speaker 4>so I contacted all these companies and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

368
00:14:45.481 --> 00:14:45.930
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

369
00:14:45.931 --> 00:14:48.240
<v Speaker 4>I want to review these things and make a</v>
<v Speaker 4>video out.</v>

370
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.270
<v Speaker 4>So all these companies sent me the </v>
<v Speaker 4>samples,</v>

371
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:56.350
<v Speaker 4>products of their things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for a couple of weeks straight I was </v>

372
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.280
<v Speaker 4>smoking only electronic cigarettes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

373
00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:02.150
<v Speaker 4>they had a cigar version two that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>love the cigar one,</v>

374
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:07.151
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then I noticed that I was spitting </v>

375
00:15:07.151 --> 00:15:10.160
<v Speaker 4>up blood and it's got a chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a chemical used in a smoke machines,</v>

376
00:15:10.161 --> 00:15:11.600
<v Speaker 4>like a dance clubs and stuff like that.</v>

377
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.470
<v Speaker 4>Like a fog machine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget the name of the chemical,</v>

378
00:15:13.471 --> 00:15:16.280
<v Speaker 4>a chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what one of the negative parts about</v>

379
00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:21.281
<v Speaker 4>that chemical is as it dries out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will dry you out to dry your skin </v>

380
00:15:21.281 --> 00:15:25.841
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or if you put it in your throat it will </v>

381
00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:27.671
<v Speaker 4>drive your fucking throw it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was getting like these lesions on </v>

382
00:15:27.671 --> 00:15:30.701
<v Speaker 4>my throat from my throat being so </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking dry that I started spitting out </v>

383
00:15:30.701 --> 00:15:31.340
<v Speaker 4>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I pretty much was like,</v>

384
00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:32.560
<v Speaker 4>fuck doing a review.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

385
00:15:32.561 --> 00:15:34.460
<v Speaker 4>I told all these people that sent me the</v>
<v Speaker 4>products,</v>

386
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.850
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

387
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:36.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to do this review for you </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I don't mind.</v>

388
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:42.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to bash what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>selling because bloody throat is a lot </v>

389
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.930
<v Speaker 4>different than fucking inhaling smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would ask the Co,</v>

390
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.560
<v Speaker 4>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was it,</v>

391
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.160
<v Speaker 4>were they all electronic cigarette </v>
<v Speaker 4>companies or were they other one?</v>

392
00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:51.080
<v Speaker 4>When I was trying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they tried to put these,</v>

393
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.640
<v Speaker 4>these magnets behind your ear lobe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

394
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:59.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gave me like these magnets that you </v>

395
00:15:59.710 --> 00:15:59.710
<v Speaker 4>put behind your ear lobe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen now what is that?</v>

396
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:03.511
<v Speaker 4>And then it was supposed to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it was supposed to </v>

397
00:16:03.511 --> 00:16:06.761
<v Speaker 4>stop your cravings for smoking </v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes and I'd never tried it.</v>

398
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.280
<v Speaker 4>I think that sounds like</v>

399
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:09.260
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

400
00:16:09.261 --> 00:16:14.261
<v Speaker 2>This is kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's FDA release on these electronic </v>

401
00:16:14.261 --> 00:16:17.501
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes is actually kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The US Food and Drug Administration </v>

402
00:16:17.501 --> 00:16:21.551
<v Speaker 2>today announced that a laboratory </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis of electronic cigarettes </v>

403
00:16:21.551 --> 00:16:25.781
<v Speaker 2>samples has found that they contain </v>
<v Speaker 2>carcinogens and toxic chemicals such as </v>

404
00:16:25.941 --> 00:16:30.941
<v Speaker 2>Diane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethylene glycol and ingredient used in </v>

405
00:16:30.941 --> 00:16:34.600
<v Speaker 2>antifreeze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So amazing that they decided to release </v>

406
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.991
<v Speaker 2>this press release.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're basically saying is the </v>

407
00:16:37.991 --> 00:16:37.991
<v Speaker 2>fake poison is poison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

408
00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.900
<v Speaker 2>What about the real shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fuck heads.</v>

409
00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Why are you releasing this on these </v>
<v Speaker 2>electronic cigarettes and not clamoring </v>

410
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:51.731
<v Speaker 2>for the removal of cigarettes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking stores and grocery stores.</v>

411
00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:57.221
<v Speaker 2>I go to the grocery store and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>goddamn cigarette carton area where you </v>

412
00:16:57.221 --> 00:16:57.221
<v Speaker 2>can buy poison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

413
00:16:57.221 --> 00:16:59.550
<v Speaker 2>You can buy addictive drugs that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>do anything for it.</v>

414
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Or they do something for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stimulate your.</v>

415
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Like Steven King said that when he quit </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes is that he's writing actually</v>

416
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:07.550
<v Speaker 2>suffered a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

417
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

418
00:17:07.931 --> 00:17:08.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

419
00:17:08.151 --> 00:17:11.660
<v Speaker 2>Hold a hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hard time firing his synopsis up when he</v>

420
00:17:11.661 --> 00:17:11.810
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

421
00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.560
<v Speaker 4>Because 20 percent of his head is </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>

422
00:17:13.561 --> 00:17:15.650
<v Speaker 4>I want a cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just go outside and Sarah,</v>

423
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.330
<v Speaker 4>you know what I got?</v>

424
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.390
<v Speaker 2>He says it's almost brain doesn't work </v>
<v Speaker 2>as fast.</v>

425
00:17:18.391 --> 00:17:20.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's a stimulant and some sort of</v>

426
00:17:20.051 --> 00:17:21.780
<v Speaker 2>a does something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

427
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.500
<v Speaker 4>I've almost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm almost a year done.</v>

428
00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.950
<v Speaker 4>I quit by um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hit me hypnosis.</v>

429
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:27.820
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

430
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:33.170
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got hypnotized three times and I on </v>

431
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.330
<v Speaker 4>the second one is the one you quit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never had a cigarette.</v>

432
00:17:34.331 --> 00:17:35.470
<v Speaker 4>I smoked on the way in.</v>

433
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:37.680
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You smoked on the way in.</v>

434
00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:42.681
<v Speaker 2>They did the hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hypnosis thing to me seems to only </v>

435
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:42.681
<v Speaker 2>one work.</v>

436
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:46.170
<v Speaker 4>If you really truly want it to work to </v>
<v Speaker 4>prepare for it.</v>

437
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:51.410
<v Speaker 4>You go in there like a little sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>under the agreement that you are going </v>

438
00:17:51.861 --> 00:17:56.861
<v Speaker 4>to give into this experience and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to change you and if you believe </v>

439
00:17:56.861 --> 00:17:57.690
<v Speaker 4>that it's almost like a placebo effect </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the mind.</v>

440
00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.790
<v Speaker 4>Here's how it worked for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can get hypnotized,</v>

441
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:00.180
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

442
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.790
<v Speaker 3>I had said that I was never hypnotized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's how I put it.</v>

443
00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:06.190
<v Speaker 3>If the doctor touched my Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have known about it,</v>

444
00:18:06.191 --> 00:18:09.220
<v Speaker 3>but I wasn't at another area like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would've been.</v>

445
00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:10.350
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

446
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.450
<v Speaker 3>now I know someone says chicken and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>start blowing everyone in the room.</v>

447
00:18:13.451 --> 00:18:18.451
<v Speaker 3>You never got to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I could ever be that </v>

448
00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:21.811
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was in a place like he would get </v>

449
00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:22.080
<v Speaker 3>me to a place where I was thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>other shit and he.</v>

450
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.000
<v Speaker 3>I heard him like just being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not a smoker anymore,</v>

451
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.640
<v Speaker 3>this is not part of your life and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>are things that you don't do anymore.</v>

452
00:18:27.641 --> 00:18:29.020
<v Speaker 3>You don't need cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not who you are.</v>

453
00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.330
<v Speaker 3>And he just kept repeating this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>

454
00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:36.570
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a beach and then look at the </v>

455
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:37.951
<v Speaker 3>fucking tits on that and then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all like just going off in a different </v>

456
00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:39.670
<v Speaker 3>place and he just kept talking to me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we'll be over.</v>

457
00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:44.730
<v Speaker 3>So you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were listening to him and you were </v>

458
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:44.730
<v Speaker 3>fantasizing about other different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

459
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:49.230
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he would be like think about </v>

460
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.230
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to think about and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>

461
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.650
<v Speaker 3>you start doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to think about anything but</v>

462
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.560
<v Speaker 3>yesterday when already told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to think about the Ra?</v>

463
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.810
<v Speaker 3>And then you need to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're all over the place.</v>

464
00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.380
<v Speaker 3>You can't not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't not just think about nothing.</v>

465
00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.380
<v Speaker 3>So while he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while I'm off thinking about this,</v>

466
00:19:02.381 --> 00:19:05.350
<v Speaker 3>he's literally like whispering and put </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a soft way,</v>

467
00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 3>like just this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these thing.</v>

468
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:09.250
<v Speaker 3>And every once in a while I'd go back </v>
<v Speaker 3>over here and be like,</v>

469
00:19:09.251 --> 00:19:10.460
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you saying?</v>

470
00:19:10.461 --> 00:19:11.170
<v Speaker 3>And be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

471
00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:11.710
<v Speaker 3>don't smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

472
00:19:11.711 --> 00:19:12.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

473
00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:17.401
<v Speaker 3>but I'm back over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he did that for like five or six </v>

474
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:17.401
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

475
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:20.430
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me that was the entire hypnosis part </v>

476
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:20.430
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the beginning of it,</v>

477
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:21.940
<v Speaker 3>like he'd start off every session with </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

478
00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.390
<v Speaker 3>I knew I wanted to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

479
00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:24.490
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

480
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.560
<v Speaker 3>you have to want to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would go in there and those </v>

481
00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:29.730
<v Speaker 3>conversations like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

482
00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:30.070
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

483
00:19:30.071 --> 00:19:31.450
<v Speaker 3>you should quit smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

484
00:19:31.451 --> 00:19:31.930
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

485
00:19:31.931 --> 00:19:32.590
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

486
00:19:32.591 --> 00:19:33.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cancer and everything.</v>

487
00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:34.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

488
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:39.300
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that conversation that lasts for </v>

489
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:39.300
<v Speaker 3>three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That now is.</v>

490
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.780
<v Speaker 3>He's drawing it out for 40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

491
00:19:40.781 --> 00:19:41.010
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

492
00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.760
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to die,</v>

493
00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:47.790
<v Speaker 3>it's one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to die and your son's is </v>

494
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.361
<v Speaker 3>going to come visit you in the hospital </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's going to go into the room and </v>

495
00:19:49.361 --> 00:19:49.361
<v Speaker 3>he's going to see all the tubes going </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside of you.</v>

496
00:19:49.361 --> 00:19:50.380
<v Speaker 3>How do you think that's going to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>him feel,</v>

497
00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:55.410
<v Speaker 3>do you think he's good at and you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>painting like worst fucking case </v>

498
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.210
<v Speaker 3>scenario and then he does the hypnosis </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and at the end it was um,</v>

499
00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:03.930
<v Speaker 3>gave me like a little mantra to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever I had a craving and I haven't </v>

500
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.471
<v Speaker 3>had a cigarette since,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since the moment I thought about it </v>

501
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:07.471
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

506
00:20:11.421 --> 00:20:16.421
<v Speaker 4>super skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're so skeptical you would never be </v>

507
00:20:16.421 --> 00:20:16.421
<v Speaker 4>willing to give in to anything like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

508
00:20:16.421 --> 00:20:19.580
<v Speaker 4>My sister had it done and she audio </v>
<v Speaker 4>recorded it and I,</v>

509
00:20:19.581 --> 00:20:24.581
<v Speaker 4>I wish I still had this cd because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>used to listen to it in my car and </v>

510
00:20:24.581 --> 00:20:28.751
<v Speaker 4>laughed my ass off and it was only one </v>
<v Speaker 4>time for her that she went and it worked</v>

511
00:20:28.821 --> 00:20:31.870
<v Speaker 4>for two months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was just like the,</v>

512
00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.110
<v Speaker 4>this chick saying stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes are going to grow us.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Didn't make it up fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want cigarettes.</v>

514
00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.420

<v Speaker 4>I don't remember in religious.</v>

515
00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.920
<v Speaker 4>Maybe this is some lady devised her own </v>
<v Speaker 4>tech.</v>

516
00:20:42.921 --> 00:20:44.110

519
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 4>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could</v>

521
00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.860

<v Speaker 1>Been Bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

579
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Hence the name of their show and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

580
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:24.890
<v Speaker 1>there's been a bunch of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever been able to prove that </v>

581
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:28.060
<v Speaker 1>there's a psychic ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only psychic ability that has been </v>

582
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:32.191
<v Speaker 1>proven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a very odd one and we all </v>

583
00:23:32.191 --> 00:23:35.101
<v Speaker 1>kind of knew about this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell when people are looking at </v>

584
00:23:35.101 --> 00:23:35.620
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can tell,</v>

585
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.410
<v Speaker 1>people are looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

586
00:23:38.411 --> 00:23:40.540
<v Speaker 1>you can't figure out what the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>lottery is.</v>

587
00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.360
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to know who's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>win the world series in 2013,</v>

588
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 1>but you can tell when are looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

589
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's statistically proven that they've </v>

590
00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:51.560
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've done controlled studies where,</v>

591
00:23:51.561 --> 00:23:56.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were looking in another </v>

592
00:23:56.561 --> 00:23:58.391
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to say when they thought someone </v>

593
00:23:58.391 --> 00:23:58.391
<v Speaker 2>was looking at them and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was measurable.</v>

594
00:23:58.391 --> 00:24:00.860
<v Speaker 2>It was a measurable even from like </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind or like your blind spots.</v>

595
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.390
<v Speaker 2>And that would have to say that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

596
00:24:02.391 --> 00:24:06.080
<v Speaker 2>any sort of a test situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be the worst time to be using</v>

597
00:24:06.081 --> 00:24:08.760
<v Speaker 2>some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Not using some,</v>

598
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to,</v>

599
00:24:10.131 --> 00:24:15.131
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to do that because I would think </v>

600
00:24:15.131 --> 00:24:15.131
<v Speaker 2>you'd be so aware that you're in a test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be so aware,</v>

601
00:24:15.131 --> 00:24:18.050
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm being judged me on high alert.</v>

602
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.120
<v Speaker 2>Well not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be all fucked up.</v>

603
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:25.150
<v Speaker 2>They'd be all fucked up by this </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial situation where you're </v>

604
00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:25.150
<v Speaker 2>monitoring your instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

605
00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:26.390
<v Speaker 2>but I have this many times in my life </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I was like,</v>

606
00:24:26.391 --> 00:24:27.290
<v Speaker 2>what's the fuck is going on?</v>

607
00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:32.290
<v Speaker 2>I turned and look at someone's giving me</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mad dog and I'm like doing my own </v>

608
00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:32.290
<v Speaker 2>thing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it be like waiting in a,</v>

609
00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:37.260
<v Speaker 2>at a best buy just staring at someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>just to see that person do your own </v>

610
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:37.260
<v Speaker 2>test?</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 15.</v>

611
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.830
<v Speaker 2>They did not turn around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not a hundred percent.</v>

612
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.080
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably not even 50 percent,</v>

613
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:47.170
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's something there that</v>
<v Speaker 2>every now and then pops in when someone </v>

614
00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:47.840
<v Speaker 2>can just reach out with their energy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>touch you.</v>

615
00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:53.140
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's also probably has to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the kind of intent that they have </v>

616
00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:53.180
<v Speaker 2>in their mind while they're staring at </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

617
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.760
<v Speaker 2>I think if someone's staring at you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

618
00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:56.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:24:56.691 --> 00:24:57.290
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

620
00:24:57.291 --> 00:24:59.140
<v Speaker 2>this guy seems like he's got his shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

621
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I liked the way he dresses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

622
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:03.680
<v Speaker 2>fucking got a cool t shirt on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe then you're going to be like,</v>

623
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let him look at me.</v>

624
00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.810
<v Speaker 2>It's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like,</v>

625
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:08.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

626
00:25:08.331 --> 00:25:13.331
<v Speaker 2>I think I could fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure I could fucking just </v>

627
00:25:13.331 --> 00:25:13.760
<v Speaker 2>fold them down fucking with a rock and </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep them alive.</v>

628
00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:16.340
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

629
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.760
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

630
00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Then maybe it would come up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd be like,</v>

631
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.760
<v Speaker 2>don't be greedy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk to me.</v>

632
00:25:22.761 --> 00:25:27.761
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just give me the eyes when you did that </v>

633
00:25:27.761 --> 00:25:27.761
<v Speaker 2>target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve wants.</v>

634
00:25:27.761 --> 00:25:27.890
<v Speaker 2>It's very comfortable for me to look to </v>
<v Speaker 2>my left for some reason.</v>

635
00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:30.530
<v Speaker 2>I never have violent thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

636
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.360
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to attack from the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

637
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.370
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's something,</v>

638
00:25:34.371 --> 00:25:37.040
<v Speaker 2>there's something to the human mind that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not a,</v>

639
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.810
<v Speaker 2>it's not static.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

640
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:43.850
<v Speaker 2>what we have right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our abilities right now are probably </v>

641
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:47.801
<v Speaker 2>evolving and our ability to recognize </v>
<v Speaker 2>our environment and to tune into other </v>

642
00:25:47.801 --> 00:25:48.500
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably evolving.</v>

643
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say that just a few thousand years </v>

644
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:54.590
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people could not read silently.</v>

645
00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:00.200
<v Speaker 2>This was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was a trick that someone had </v>

646
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:00.200
<v Speaker 2>learned how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those,</v>

647
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.060
<v Speaker 2>one of the saints and one of the ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this guy proved his St Hood was </v>

648
00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.810
<v Speaker 2>that he could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could recite things that he had just </v>

649
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:11.201
<v Speaker 2>read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could close the book and he would </v>

650
00:26:11.201 --> 00:26:14.021
<v Speaker 2>look at the book and not say anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>aloud so they didn't know he was </v>

651
00:26:14.021 --> 00:26:16.751
<v Speaker 2>reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would read things and then close the </v>

652
00:26:16.751 --> 00:26:18.761
<v Speaker 2>book and then tell you what he just read</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they thought that this guy was who </v>

653
00:26:18.761 --> 00:26:22.101
<v Speaker 2>was a deity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought that he was a priest or </v>

654
00:26:22.101 --> 00:26:24.820
<v Speaker 2>they thought that he was a saint because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had this ability that no one else </v>

655
00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:25.250
<v Speaker 2>could do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could read silently,</v>

656
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.910
<v Speaker 2>like it makes sense you because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember when you were a little kid,</v>

657
00:26:28.911 --> 00:26:29.960
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't read silently.</v>

658
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:34.160
<v Speaker 2>You would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would read use stream dot,</v>

659
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.950
<v Speaker 2>t v though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to spell it out,</v>

660
00:26:36.951 --> 00:26:41.951
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to make the noise and you'd </v>

661
00:26:41.951 --> 00:26:42.380
<v Speaker 2>have to recognize that noise after you </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it.</v>

662
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.910
<v Speaker 2>Well then people learn how to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>noise in their head,</v>

663
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't always know how to do that.</v>

664
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:48.510
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

665
00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.750
<v Speaker 2>it's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

666
00:26:49.751 --> 00:26:52.090
<v Speaker 2>an evolution of language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

667
00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:54.570
<v Speaker 2>and evolution of the way we interface </v>
<v Speaker 2>with language.</v>

668
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:59.100
<v Speaker 2>But it's also like it may be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>in our minds,</v>

669
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:04.160
<v Speaker 2>it may be something that we didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to process before and we do </v>

670
00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.491
<v Speaker 2>now because written type and reading is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very commonplace that we have developed </v>

671
00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:12.951
<v Speaker 2>this ability to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very possible that the minds that </v>

672
00:27:12.951 --> 00:27:12.951
<v Speaker 2>we are working with are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

673
00:27:12.951 --> 00:27:17.450
<v Speaker 2>much different than the minds of a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand years ago when there was no </v>

674
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.090
<v Speaker 2>mass media and there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

675
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.760
<v Speaker 2>there was no phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no nothing.</v>

676
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
<v Speaker 2>There's been a always been some weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>speculation that people were able to </v>

677
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.501
<v Speaker 2>tune into mother Gaia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that some people were able to tune into </v>

678
00:27:30.501 --> 00:27:34.101
<v Speaker 2>the forest and able to tune into </v>
<v Speaker 2>information that comes from all the </v>

679
00:27:34.101 --> 00:27:36.480
<v Speaker 2>animals and nature around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a show,</v>

680
00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Charles Kuralt on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we've talked about this before,</v>

681
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:42.420
<v Speaker 2>but there was a guy who used to live in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alaska and he said that he was,</v>

682
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:47.430
<v Speaker 2>he was a prospector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would live out there by himself for </v>

683
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.061
<v Speaker 2>months at a time and after awhile he </v>
<v Speaker 2>could talk to the animals with his </v>

684
00:27:50.061 --> 00:27:50.550
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What really.</v>

685
00:27:50.551 --> 00:27:53.190
<v Speaker 2>And when he would come back into town </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually it would go away,</v>

686
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.560
<v Speaker 2>but he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said there wasn't words,</v>

687
00:27:55.561 --> 00:27:59.190
<v Speaker 2>but there was a way of communicating </v>
<v Speaker 2>with animals that you would have because</v>

688
00:27:59.191 --> 00:28:02.070
<v Speaker 2>you was no TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no radio there were you,</v>

689
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.960
<v Speaker 2>you got tuned into different things.</v>

690
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:08.040
<v Speaker 2>It sounds totally like horseshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Dr doolittle.</v>

691
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.210
<v Speaker 2>But if you talk to like the Indians or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the natives in Peru,</v>

692
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.120
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

693
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.120
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they brew this Iowasca stuff.</v>

694
00:28:15.121 --> 00:28:16.640
<v Speaker 2>The psychedelic beverage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

695
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm Robin quivers went down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

696
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.710
<v Speaker 2>well the thing about Iowasca is they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been doing it for 10,000</v>

697
00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:27.711
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way before written history and then you </v>

698
00:28:27.711 --> 00:28:28.200
<v Speaker 2>ask them how they learned how to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

699
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:33.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean the speculation is 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago there was a real evidence is </v>

700
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.230
<v Speaker 2>probably only like a couple thousand </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars,</v>

701
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:36.300
<v Speaker 2>but when they ask these people how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out how to do this,</v>

702
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:41.200
<v Speaker 2>they say that the forest told them that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the plants told them how to do this.</v>

703
00:28:41.201 --> 00:28:43.830
<v Speaker 2>I told them how to make this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's over 100,000</v>

704
00:28:43.831 --> 00:28:48.831
<v Speaker 2>different plants in the Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figured out how to take the leaves </v>

705
00:28:48.831 --> 00:28:52.281
<v Speaker 2>of one and the root and the vines of </v>
<v Speaker 2>another and combine them because one of </v>

706
00:28:52.291 --> 00:28:57.291
<v Speaker 2>them contains the chemical DMT and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other one contains what's called an Mao </v>

707
00:28:57.291 --> 00:29:01.311
<v Speaker 2>inhibitor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something called harmeet because you </v>

708
00:29:01.311 --> 00:29:01.311
<v Speaker 2>can't eat this psychedelic stuff.</v>

709
00:29:01.311 --> 00:29:03.930
<v Speaker 2>You can't eat dmt because it exists in </v>
<v Speaker 2>so many different things that if you eat</v>

710
00:29:03.931 --> 00:29:08.931
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body has the ability to break it </v>

711
00:29:08.931 --> 00:29:08.931
<v Speaker 2>down inside your stomach with mano </v>
<v Speaker 2>aiming oxidase.</v>

712
00:29:08.931 --> 00:29:13.520
<v Speaker 2>So this stuff called harming this other </v>
<v Speaker 2>plant that produces this natural Mao </v>

713
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.691
<v Speaker 2>inhibitor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to mix this stuff in and they </v>

714
00:29:17.691 --> 00:29:18.120
<v Speaker 2>have to boil it and they have to break </v>
<v Speaker 2>it down over hours.</v>

715
00:29:18.121 --> 00:29:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck did these,</v>

716
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:23.460
<v Speaker 2>these people living on dirt floors and </v>
<v Speaker 2>huts with no books?</v>

717
00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:28.461
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck did they ever figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to take these plants and put them </v>

718
00:29:28.461 --> 00:29:28.461
<v Speaker 2>together?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

719
00:29:28.461 --> 00:29:29.520
<v Speaker 2>they say that the forest told them how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

720
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:34.670
<v Speaker 2>It sounds real thousand dead people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't put those two together and then </v>

721
00:29:36.781 --> 00:29:38.250
<v Speaker 2>use frank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fucked,</v>

722
00:29:38.251 --> 00:29:38.640
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

723
00:29:38.641 --> 00:29:40.980
<v Speaker 2>The real question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did this information,</v>

724
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:42.950
<v Speaker 2>the forest telling them to do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>

725
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Did it happen after they took the </v>
<v Speaker 2>IOWASCA?</v>

726
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.740
<v Speaker 2>Because that would make a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do they just stop with Iowasca?</v>

727
00:29:47.741 --> 00:29:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't they just give us more?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give us other good shit,</v>

728
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.630
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need anything else.</v>

729
00:29:52.631 --> 00:29:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Once you do the Ios,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really don't.</v>

730
00:29:54.641 --> 00:29:57.910
<v Speaker 2>You Know Robin quivers is talked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and you know,</v>

731
00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:02.960
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about it and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've told to standup tune dust and hope </v>

732
00:30:03.371 --> 00:30:08.371
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of people that I know </v>

733
00:30:08.371 --> 00:30:08.371
<v Speaker 2>that have had dmt in their life and once</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done it,</v>

734
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:11.740
<v Speaker 2>everything else seems completely silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

735
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.300
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economy seemed silly.</v>

736
00:30:13.301 --> 00:30:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Your life seemed silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Driving and traffic seems silly.</v>

737
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:22.260
<v Speaker 2>Media seemed silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything seems silly and juvenile and </v>

738
00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:22.260
<v Speaker 2>temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How well,</v>

739
00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:22.990
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

740
00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:28.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like a thing where you can go </v>

741
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:28.270
<v Speaker 3>on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need like</v>

742
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:28.660
<v Speaker 2>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll need some time to digest it.</v>

743
00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:32.020
<v Speaker 2>You don't need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need time to do the drug.</v>

744
00:30:32.021 --> 00:30:34.300
<v Speaker 2>If you smoked DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it only takes about 15 minutes.</v>

745
00:30:34.301 --> 00:30:35.600
<v Speaker 2>If you take Iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

746
00:30:35.601 --> 00:30:38.020
<v Speaker 2>orally active version.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a less,</v>

747
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:43.320
<v Speaker 2>less potent version of the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's over a few hours as opposed to </v>

748
00:30:43.751 --> 00:30:45.580
<v Speaker 2>over 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

749
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:50.470
<v Speaker 2>but what it is is the most trippy </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

750
00:30:50.471 --> 00:30:55.471
<v Speaker 2>the most bizarre outside of this world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most separate experience you could </v>

751
00:30:55.471 --> 00:30:57.280
<v Speaker 2>ever possibly have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you've had that,</v>

752
00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you start talking about why,</v>

753
00:30:59.221 --> 00:31:00.530
<v Speaker 2>why doesn't he do other things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What doesn't?</v>

754
00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.310
<v Speaker 2>He figured out how to make a fucking jet</v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

755
00:31:03.311 --> 00:31:05.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the plants need to teach them.</v>

756
00:31:05.201 --> 00:31:06.430
<v Speaker 2>How to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

757
00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:11.820
<v Speaker 2>You just want to go back to that world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those fucking people that live in the </v>

758
00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Amazon man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like doing it all the time.</v>

759
00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:13.840
<v Speaker 2>They just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

760
00:31:13.841 --> 00:31:18.841
<v Speaker 2>they just did this tune in to the spirit</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and astral travel on fucking </v>

761
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.890
<v Speaker 2>illuminance snakes that fly through the</v>

762
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:26.550
<v Speaker 3>a pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Different like can you go back and be </v>

763
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:26.550
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

764
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:26.640
<v Speaker 3>I wish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or is it something like,</v>

765
00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:32.010
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it make like the experience of </v>

766
00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:35.700
<v Speaker 3>smoking pot like any different now at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that I think the less less important</v>

767
00:31:36.461 --> 00:31:37.210
<v Speaker 3>or less fun or.</v>

768
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:38.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you.</v>

769
00:31:38.151 --> 00:31:43.151
<v Speaker 2>You first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one time I had a flashback after I took </v>

770
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:43.990
<v Speaker 2>it from smoking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been able to do it again.</v>

771
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:49.500
<v Speaker 2>One time I did DMT and then a week later</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was smoking weed and I had a </v>

772
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.881
<v Speaker 2>flashback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real flashback where I got to the </v>

773
00:31:53.881 --> 00:31:54.070
<v Speaker 2>door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a door to like when you,</v>

774
00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.130
<v Speaker 2>when you have the DMT experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fucked up experience.</v>

775
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:02.250
<v Speaker 2>And for those of you that are anti-drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for those of you that are listening </v>

776
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:02.250
<v Speaker 2>to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are like,</v>

777
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:06.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of fucking losers talking </v>

778
00:32:06.631 --> 00:32:06.631
<v Speaker 2>about doing drugs and would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this stupid shit?</v>

779
00:32:06.631 --> 00:32:11.401
<v Speaker 2>And there's kids listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think human beings owe an obligation </v>

780
00:32:11.401 --> 00:32:13.540
<v Speaker 2>to tell the truth about their </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences and their.</v>

781
00:32:13.541 --> 00:32:16.180
<v Speaker 2>There is something to this that's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>life changing.</v>

782
00:32:16.181 --> 00:32:18.460
<v Speaker 2>It changed me for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It still is changing me.</v>

783
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.640
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

784
00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:23.320
<v Speaker 2>my dmt experiences for sure have made me</v>
<v Speaker 2>a better person,</v>

785
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.120
<v Speaker 2>a nicer person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more sensitive,</v>

786
00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.220
<v Speaker 2>more aware of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

787
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:32.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not perfect by any stretch of the </v>

788
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.841
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm under a lot of pressure and </v>

789
00:32:33.841 --> 00:32:35.480
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I snap at people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to keep it all together as much </v>

790
00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.090
<v Speaker 2>as humanly possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for sure I'm absolutely different at</v>

791
00:32:37.091 --> 00:32:40.880
<v Speaker 2>my core because of having a dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All drugs aren't good for you,</v>

792
00:32:40.881 --> 00:32:42.290
<v Speaker 2>but some drugs are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

793
00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:44.430
<v Speaker 2>and they're not too good for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do what?</v>

794
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.110
<v Speaker 2>We should have fucking shamans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should have places where you could go</v>

795
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:53.190
<v Speaker 2>where you could go to some professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>place where this guy is sanctioned by </v>

796
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:54.110
<v Speaker 2>the community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is the guy that knows how to do</v>

797
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:59.111
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms and you go to this guy's house</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's got brilliant mushrooms and </v>

798
00:32:59.111 --> 00:32:59.320
<v Speaker 2>they're all perfect and he grows </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself,</v>

799
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.000
<v Speaker 2>says there's nothing sketchy and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many mushroom trips you've been on?</v>

800
00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.290
<v Speaker 2>A thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

801
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.560
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A thousand you're doing.</v>

802
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.190
<v Speaker 2>How many grams we going to do today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

803
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.990
<v Speaker 2>this is what we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be in this room,</v>

804
00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.000
<v Speaker 2>silent darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to do five grams.</v>

805
00:33:11.001 --> 00:33:13.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be outside the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be totally sober.</v>

806
00:33:13.101 --> 00:33:14.480
<v Speaker 2>I have a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a car.</v>

807
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.160
<v Speaker 2>I can take it to the hospital if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to,</v>

808
00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:20.180

<v Speaker 2>only in your mind and you're going to be</v>

809
00:33:20.181 --> 00:33:21.770
<v Speaker 2>fine physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't worry about it.</v>

810
00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:26.771
<v Speaker 2>I've been there a thousand times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody dies from this shit and then you </v>

811
00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:29.171
<v Speaker 2>could go and do it instead of being over</v>
<v Speaker 2>your friends house and you fucking </v>

812
00:33:29.171 --> 00:33:29.870
<v Speaker 2>escape into the woods and then you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>too fucked up</v>

813
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:31.150
<v Speaker 3>for the words you don't know how to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to you.</v>

814
00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:36.380
<v Speaker 3>So much better.</v>

<v Speaker 3>with a phone call.</v>

816
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.880
<v Speaker 3>But it's funny though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't be called the police but </v>

817
00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.240
<v Speaker 3>like I do that now with like I called </v>

<v Speaker 3>you take two thirds.</v>

822
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:54.710
<v Speaker 3>If you want that hour to kick in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five hours and a half hour later we'd be</v>

823
00:33:54.711 --> 00:33:55.680
<v Speaker 3>hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was.</v>

<v Speaker 3>cannot trust Joey Diaz.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and about like mortgage rates.</v>

828
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.280
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't take it yet.</v>

829
00:34:07.281 --> 00:34:10.040
<v Speaker 3>And I swear to God to the two things I </v>
<v Speaker 3>trust them the most about.</v>

830

<v Speaker 3>Probably not.</v>

833
00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:21.350
<v Speaker 3>He got a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would do it just for the story and </v>

834
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:21.350
<v Speaker 3>how to use Google.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one time,</v>

835
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:25.421
<v Speaker 3>one time we came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was driving him home from the comedy </v>

<v Speaker 3>standing right there.</v>

842
00:34:36.291 --> 00:34:36.560

<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

844

903
00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.180
<v Speaker 3>like gauze in there and leave it there </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a week and then pull it out.</v>

904
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:55.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

905
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.310
<v Speaker 3>It was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How'd you get it?</v>

906
00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:57.180
<v Speaker 3>Basketball.</v>

907
00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:00.060
<v Speaker 2>It's all about sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I've never had a staff.</v>

908
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:04.800
<v Speaker 2>It's really washing yourself afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also taking probiotics.</v>

909
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:06.780
<v Speaker 2>You go to take a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>probiotics.</v>

910
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:08.310
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like this probiotic,</v>

911
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.560
<v Speaker 2>Kimchi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pickled cabbage.</v>

912
00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.500
<v Speaker 2>You get that from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's delicious.</v>

913
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a hostile cabbage fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cabbage rolls with throwing.</v>

914
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.420
<v Speaker 2>You gotta try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll give you some afterwards.</v>

915
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Sauerkraut and cabbage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's spicy though.</v>

916
00:37:20.581 --> 00:37:25.581
<v Speaker 2>It's like a spicy Korean cabbage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can get it at some organic </v>

917
00:37:25.581 --> 00:37:25.581
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's probiotic.</v>

918
00:37:25.581 --> 00:37:29.901
<v Speaker 2>Will they do is they take the cabbage </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they leave it out for like a few </v>

919
00:37:29.901 --> 00:37:30.720
<v Speaker 2>days and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pick a lit with a bunch of different</v>

920
00:37:30.721 --> 00:37:32.280
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly the whole process,</v>

921

<v Speaker 4>whatever happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>

1037
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:10.250
<v Speaker 4>And if the car is dangerous as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that shit doesn't really work.</v>

1038
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:12.950
<v Speaker 4>You hit your head on the concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks awesome in the movies,</v>

1039
00:42:12.951 --> 00:42:14.490
<v Speaker 4>but the reality of rolling out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>

1040
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:15.140
<v Speaker 4>Horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1041
00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:18.800
<v Speaker 4>You're basically falling onto the </v>
<v Speaker 4>concrete at 30 miles an hour or whatever</v>

1042
00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:19.540
<v Speaker 4>the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fast.</v>

1043
00:42:19.541 --> 00:42:20.510
<v Speaker 4>You're going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How fast were you going?</v>

1044
00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.380
<v Speaker 4>You crashed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably not.</v>

1045
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:26.350
<v Speaker 4>We probably go in 25 when he did it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then we probably went up to like 45 when</v>

1046
00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:28.670
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>

1047
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:30.950
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was scary as fuck.</v>

1048
00:42:30.951 --> 00:42:32.630
<v Speaker 4>Where's that dude now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1049
00:42:32.631 --> 00:42:36.910
<v Speaker 4>well he joined the air force and then he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was one of the special six,</v>

1050
00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:42.220
<v Speaker 4>now they killed the frozen bid lodging </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he came out of the closet and told </v>

1051
00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.490
<v Speaker 4>everyone except me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is odd.</v>

1052
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.820
<v Speaker 4>And then now he works for a company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's gay.</v>

1053
00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he hasn't told his parents or anyone</v>

1054
00:42:48.981 --> 00:42:49.970
<v Speaker 4>who's told all my friends.</v>

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1057
00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's probably going to.</v>

00:42:56.191 --> 00:42:56.870
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that somebody put up on the Rogan Board,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the message board about the,</v>

<v Speaker 4>whether it's drugs,</v>

<v Speaker 4>One of the worst times ever.</v>

1104

<v Speaker 4>became big in the United States.</v>

1107

<v Speaker 4>Like there was all these coffee shops </v>
<v Speaker 4>popping up everywhere and uh,</v>

1108
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:17.060
<v Speaker 4>right next door to it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the grossest gay bars in </v>

1109
00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:17.060
<v Speaker 4>Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ohio.</v>

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:17.160
<v Speaker 4>And this is like goth gay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't know that they hate.</v>

1113
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.880
<v Speaker 4>They hate everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1114
00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:28.920
<v Speaker 4>Everything awful other gay people </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves,</v>

<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

1116
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:32.250
<v Speaker 4>And the woman that owned this place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God bless her,</v>

1117
00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:36.780
<v Speaker 4>she was just like this fucking cute </v>
<v Speaker 4>little old lady that her husband died.</v>

1118
00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:38.400
<v Speaker 4>So she died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was bored and sad,</v>

1119
00:45:38.401 --> 00:45:41.010
<v Speaker 4>so she took all her money to get this </v>
<v Speaker 4>nice little coffee shop.</v>

1120
00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:46.310
<v Speaker 4>And so she's training me to be like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>manager of this place and there's this </v>

1121
00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:47.220
<v Speaker 4>window looking in the back yard of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>building,</v>

1122
00:45:47.221 --> 00:45:49.560
<v Speaker 4>which is like an alley.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she goes,</v>

1123
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:54.680
<v Speaker 4>now I made this little curtain and she </v>
<v Speaker 4>sewed this curtain to put it over the </v>

1124
00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.220
<v Speaker 4>window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At certain times.</v>

1125
00:45:56.221 --> 00:45:56.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>

1126
00:45:56.911 --> 00:46:01.911
<v Speaker 4>sometimes you're going to have to shut </v>
<v Speaker 4>this curtain because of this place next </v>

1127
00:46:01.911 --> 00:46:01.911
<v Speaker 4>door.</v>

1128
00:46:01.911 --> 00:46:02.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is she talking about one time?</v>

1129
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:05.790
<v Speaker 4>And so I used to know this job I worked </v>
<v Speaker 4>at was fucking awful.</v>

1130
00:46:05.791 --> 00:46:08.070
<v Speaker 4>Like I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would come there at like 5:00</v>

1131
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:13.070
<v Speaker 4>AM and work till like 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>PM every single day and there would be </v>

1132
00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:16.701
<v Speaker 4>guys passed out in the back of this gay </v>
<v Speaker 4>bar that just had sex out in the back of</v>

1133
00:46:16.951 --> 00:46:18.840
<v Speaker 4>the alley and then passed out on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>

1134
00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:22.740
<v Speaker 4>And so one time I just sit there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to Howard stern for hours.</v>

1135
00:46:22.741 --> 00:46:27.741
<v Speaker 4>That was my only thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one ever came into this coffee shop </v>

1136
00:46:27.741 --> 00:46:29.550
<v Speaker 4>and a one time like making chicken salad</v>

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:34.590
<v Speaker 1>there's just so many people in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but West Hollywood,</v>

1188
00:48:34.751 --> 00:48:38.350

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1192
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:47.350
<v Speaker 1>There's the gay flag is our flag of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Santa Monica Boulevard.</v>

1193
00:48:47.351 --> 00:48:50.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is our place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you drive by rage,</v>

1194
00:48:50.561 --> 00:48:52.690
<v Speaker 1>have you ever driven by raging like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday and Saturday night?</v>

1195
00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Like carnival outside?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had just fuck.</v>

1196
00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.210
<v Speaker 1>It certainly seems like they're having </v>
<v Speaker 1>more fun.</v>

1197
00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:03.630
<v Speaker 1>I picked up one of those newspapers that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had all the hookers and escorts and </v>

1198
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:06.661
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that and have like whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>pages with trannies and one of the </v>

1199
00:49:06.661 --> 00:49:08.980
<v Speaker 1>things that says onto is 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>working fully functional trannies.</v>

1200
00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got the vagina and the vagina works</v>

1201
00:49:11.951 --> 00:49:14.820
<v Speaker 1>so you can fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thanks Dick.</v>

1202
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what fully function.</v>

1203
00:49:16.961 --> 00:49:19.300
<v Speaker 1>If I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that their dick still works,</v>

1204
00:49:19.301 --> 00:49:21.580
<v Speaker 1>but their trends there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're transvestite,</v>

1205
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:24.060
<v Speaker 1>transsexual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say trannies.</v>

1206
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Like I think trans sexual is like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be a woman,</v>

1207
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:33.390
<v Speaker 1>but a transvestite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to be a man dressed as a </v>

1208
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:33.390
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a woman.</v>

1209
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:37.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transsexuals are probably the people </v>

1210
00:49:37.021 --> 00:49:37.330
<v Speaker 1>that are starting the process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming the best possible too,</v>

1211
00:49:37.331 --> 00:49:40.590
<v Speaker 1>but there's some of them are just dudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just for whatever weird reason like</v>

1212
00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:45.600
<v Speaker 1>to dress up like girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Chaz Bono is what a transsexual,</v>

1213
00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I almost had to watch that take </v>

1214
00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Rogan somewhere and I was in a waiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>room for an hour and I was watching good</v>

1215
00:49:56.531 --> 00:49:59.830
<v Speaker 1>morning America and then they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about Oprah being on next,</v>

1216
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:01.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not an accident was like at 3:00</v>

1217
00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.250
<v Speaker 1>PM and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn it.</v>

1218
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I might have to watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

1219
00:50:04.541 --> 00:50:07.150
<v Speaker 1>They keep teasing me with this Chaz Bono</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Bono thing.</v>

1220
00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.610
<v Speaker 1>I want to see the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know the real truth.</v>

1221
00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.410
<v Speaker 1>You won't get it from Oprah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get it from what?</v>

1222
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Listening to her talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I get it,</v>

1223
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:16.620
<v Speaker 1>I might get it from listening or just </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing the answers of the questions.</v>

1224
00:50:16.621 --> 00:50:19.600
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be that she was ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing that makes sense I</v>

1225
00:50:19.601 --> 00:50:20.800
<v Speaker 1>guess to see your website.</v>

1267
00:51:44.231 --> 00:51:46.660
<v Speaker 2>That's a Holtzman joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of his best.</v>

1268
00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I used to call that out from the back of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the room all the time.</v>

1269
00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Miss that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I miss that guy.</v>

1270
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:52.810
<v Speaker 2>I miss those days of the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1271
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:55.460
<v Speaker 2>A good fucking times in that club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1272
00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:58.090
<v Speaker 2>you had a lot of bad energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of good times.</v>

1273
00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:00.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard this hilarious.</v>

1274
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:05.470
<v Speaker 2>What two different people have told me </v>
<v Speaker 2>the story that Tommy said that he used </v>

1275
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:06.910
<v Speaker 2>to be an actor and he wanted to be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>actor,</v>

1276
00:52:06.911 --> 00:52:08.440
<v Speaker 2>but too many homos were hitting on him.</v>

1277
00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:10.080
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>used to run,</v>

1278
00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.020
<v Speaker 4>used to run a all male review.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dan show data,</v>

1279
00:52:13.021 --> 00:52:14.940
<v Speaker 4>not Tampa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was Jacksonville,</v>

1280
00:52:14.941 --> 00:52:15.810
<v Speaker 4>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1281
00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:16.880
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had like a,</v>

1282
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:21.300
<v Speaker 4>he truly wanted to become an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was an all male review guy.</v>

1283
00:52:21.301 --> 00:52:26.301
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would host the all male review dance </v>

1284
00:52:26.301 --> 00:52:27.180
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was like a gay strip show anyway.</v>

1285
00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:32.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he never liked when the guys came </v>

1286
00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:33.300
<v Speaker 4>onto him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's why you stayed out of acting.</v>

1287
00:52:33.301 --> 00:52:34.380
<v Speaker 4>So that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1288
00:52:34.381 --> 00:52:39.381
<v Speaker 4>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was him and Johnny Depp I think are </v>

1289
00:52:39.381 --> 00:52:42.111
<v Speaker 4>the two most irresistible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't you think Johnny Depp would have </v>

1290
00:52:42.111 --> 00:52:42.660
<v Speaker 4>been like the guy that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1291
00:52:42.661 --> 00:52:45.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm not getting into acting because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>get hit on all the time.</v>

1292
00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:48.630
<v Speaker 4>Like if Johnny Depp's cool with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Tommy Morris should know.</v>

1293
00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:50.990
<v Speaker 4>You know Johnny Depp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a,</v>

1294
00:52:50.991 --> 00:52:53.310
<v Speaker 4>a special affection for that guy.</v>

1295
00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.570
<v Speaker 4>He's just like him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like him too.</v>

1296
00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:57.690
<v Speaker 4>I saw the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's legit.</v>

1297
00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:00.300
<v Speaker 4>The pirates of the Caribbean Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1298
00:53:00.301 --> 00:53:02.520
<v Speaker 4>he looks like he's 18 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looks at me.</v>

1299
00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:05.310
<v Speaker 4>It's still do 21 jump street like 50.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is.</v>

1300
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:07.950
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen anything like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smoke cigarettes,</v>

1301
00:53:07.951 --> 00:53:08.610
<v Speaker 4>does he?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1302
00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:10.980
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] France.</v>

1303
00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:12.810
<v Speaker 4>He lives in France.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>

1304
00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:14.740
<v Speaker 4>He lives in France.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He comes on his face.</v>

1305
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000
<v Speaker 4>He lives on his friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He lives in France and his wife French </v>

1306
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.000
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1307
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.000
<v Speaker 4>that's why I'm a big</v>

1308
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.750
<v Speaker 2>fan of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ever since I found out he was a big fan </v>

1309
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:24.750
<v Speaker 2>of hunter s Thompson and then when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>did fear and loathing in las was great.</v>

1310
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Who was good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's very good.</v>

1311
00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Bill Murray was actually better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Murray did where the Buffalo </v>

1312
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:33.381
<v Speaker 2>Rome's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He played hunter s thompson and that </v>

1313
00:53:33.381 --> 00:53:33.381
<v Speaker 2>fucking genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He nailed it,</v>

1314
00:53:33.381 --> 00:53:36.950
<v Speaker 2>but the movie was not as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fear and loathing was a much better </v>

1315
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.950
<v Speaker 2>movie overall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1316
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:39.960
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think Johnny Depp is voice </v>
<v Speaker 2>where like there's certain impressions I</v>

1317
00:53:39.961 --> 00:53:41.010
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know,</v>

1318
00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:41.760
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

1319
00:53:41.761 --> 00:53:46.761
<v Speaker 2>I try and my voice doesn't work that way</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some people just can't do like </v>

1320
00:53:46.761 --> 00:53:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Depp sounds like he's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound like a version of hunter s </v>

1321
00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:55.041
<v Speaker 2>Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bill murray sounds like hunter s </v>

1322
00:53:55.041 --> 00:53:57.381
<v Speaker 2>Thompson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when I found out that Johnny </v>

1323
00:53:57.381 --> 00:53:59.300
<v Speaker 2>Depp lived in hunters basement and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking stayed with them for fucking </v>

1324
00:53:59.300 --> 00:53:59.820
<v Speaker 2>like weeks and weeks trying to work on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole impression of,</v>

1325
00:53:59.821 --> 00:54:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mica,</v>

00:54:07.861 --> 00:54:11.300
<v Speaker 3>a book and then one point she stops and </v>
<v Speaker 3>something happened.</v>

1330
00:54:11.301 --> 00:54:13.040
<v Speaker 3>We got into a conversation.</v>

<v Speaker 3>playing Abraham Lincoln's wife and </v>

1332

<v Speaker 3>Steven Spielberg's directing and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1333
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:21.110
<v Speaker 3>and Daniel Day Lewis is playing Abraham </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lincoln.</v>

1334
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it was like somewhere in the world as a </v>

1339
00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:36.341
<v Speaker 3>man walking around right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thinking that he is Abraham Lincoln </v>

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:46.760
<v Speaker 3>and months and months in advance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is preparing so that when he's there,</v>

1342
00:54:46.761 --> 00:54:47.630
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what,</v>

1343
00:54:47.631 --> 00:54:48.350
<v Speaker 3>that's all he is.</v>

1344
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:50.210
<v Speaker 2>You know when he filmed there will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood.</v>

1345
00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:52.760
<v Speaker 2>He slept in a tent set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:56.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember he got all greasy and shit.</v>

1347
00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.160
<v Speaker 2>That's how he got into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how he got into his role.</v>

1348
00:54:58.161 --> 00:55:00.710
<v Speaker 2>He just became that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just crazy.</v>

1349
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:02.360
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's my opinion.</v>

1350
00:55:02.361 --> 00:55:02.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1351
00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:07.480
<v Speaker 3>Best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the best and there's a reason why </v>

1352
00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.361
<v Speaker 3>you only doesn't move like once every </v>
<v Speaker 3>three years because it takes that </v>

1353
00:55:09.361 --> 00:55:09.361
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1354
00:55:09.361 --> 00:55:09.460
<v Speaker 3>in his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it always will,</v>

1355
00:55:09.461 --> 00:55:12.160
<v Speaker 3>but that right now it takes that to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>to there and it's like,</v>

1356
00:55:12.161 --> 00:55:13.400
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just do what you want to do.</v>

1357
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:15.080

<v Speaker 2>played a boxer?</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's called.</v>

1359
00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:20.960

<v Speaker 2>scenes in any movie ever.</v>

1360

<v Speaker 2>Fight and I watched the fight and I'm </v>

1377
00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:09.890
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking well done.</v>

1378
00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's totally realistic,</v>

1379
00:56:12.151 --> 00:56:15.350
<v Speaker 2>like the scenarios realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like the way they shot it,</v>

1380
00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.480
<v Speaker 2>super dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always moving.</v>

1381
00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I looked at the fighter and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1382
00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 2>this seems flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is like we're watching </v>

1383
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 2>rocky too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1384
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 2>I've this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1385
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:29.100
<v Speaker 1>I've seen these exact same scenes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy punching the other guy and I </v>

1386
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:32.731
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think those kinds of directors choose </v>

1387
00:56:32.731 --> 00:56:32.731
<v Speaker 1>to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what they would consider artfully,</v>

1388
00:56:32.731 --> 00:56:36.190
<v Speaker 1>where they're just gonna keep the camera</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it and let the action you need to see</v>

1389
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:39.160
<v Speaker 1>different angles you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why watching fights,</v>

1390
00:56:39.161 --> 00:56:40.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live is amazing,</v>

1391
00:56:40.361 --> 00:56:41.790
<v Speaker 1>but like I'll even on television just </v>
<v Speaker 1>seek.</v>

1392
00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:44.380
<v Speaker 1>You cut the different angles when it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a guy's in this position,</v>

1393
00:56:44.381 --> 00:56:49.381
<v Speaker 1>they can go around the other side and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cool to see those different things </v>

1394
00:56:49.381 --> 00:56:50.630
<v Speaker 1>like those already artsy movies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1395
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:55.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get to keep the camera there and </v>

1396
00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.031
<v Speaker 1>let the respectfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm mark Walberg did not imitate Micky </v>

1397
00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Ward style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't.</v>

1398
00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:02.440
<v Speaker 1>He through a decent left hook to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>body like that looked okay,</v>

1399
00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:06.100
<v Speaker 1>but micky ward had a very particular way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of holding his hands.</v>

1400
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:08.920
<v Speaker 1>He had a very particular style of </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing his,</v>

1401
00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:11.230
<v Speaker 1>his faints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has movement.</v>

1402
00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:13.300
<v Speaker 1>It was very easy to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1403
00:57:13.301 --> 00:57:16.420
<v Speaker 1>like Anderson Silva is awesome and </v>
<v Speaker 1>imitating fighters,</v>

1404
00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:17.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>key.</v>

1405
00:57:17.471 --> 00:57:22.471
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all these videos online of him </v>

1406
00:57:22.471 --> 00:57:23.770
<v Speaker 1>imitating Leo Machida and Imitating </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chuck Liddell and there's star fighters </v>

1407
00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:28.021
<v Speaker 1>of styles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a certain way they move and </v>

1408
00:57:28.021 --> 00:57:30.211
<v Speaker 1>you can't just be you in a Boston accent</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you call your name Mickey,</v>

1409
00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:31.990
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1410
00:57:31.991 --> 00:57:34.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like micky ward moved.</v>

1411
00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:39.090
<v Speaker 1>You have to box way micky ward box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why I thought you can't have </v>

1412
00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:39.520
<v Speaker 1>your chin up in the air and throwing </v>
<v Speaker 1>punches.</v>

1413
00:57:39.521 --> 00:57:44.521
<v Speaker 1>Like a guy who's never been punched in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face because that's what I'm </v>

1414
00:57:44.521 --> 00:57:44.521
<v Speaker 1>watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching.</v>

1415
00:57:44.521 --> 00:57:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching guys real punches in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing match is not like the way a guy </v>

1416
00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:48.250
<v Speaker 1>throws punches in a boxing match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It May.</v>

1417
00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

1418
00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:54.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm an extremist because my job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my jobs is to watch fighting and </v>

1419
00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:55.450
<v Speaker 1>analyze it and break it down.</v>

1420
00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:56.710
<v Speaker 1>But I'm watching this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1421
00:57:56.711 --> 00:57:58.470
<v Speaker 1>you didn't even try man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't even try.</v>

1422
00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:00.580
<v Speaker 1>If I was your friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was mark Wahlberg's friend,</v>

1423
00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo dude,</v>

1424
00:58:01.601 --> 00:58:05.380
<v Speaker 1>this is a fucking micky ward is one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys,</v>

1425
00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:08.410
<v Speaker 1>especially in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's where he's from.</v>

1426
00:58:08.411 --> 00:58:10.640
<v Speaker 1>That's where walbergs from to this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>cares.</v>

1427
00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:12.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a legend to that guy.</v>

1428
00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:16.030
<v Speaker 1>He's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an all time great Boston character.</v>

1429
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:19.840
<v Speaker 1>His fights had the display of courage </v>
<v Speaker 1>and will.</v>

1430
00:58:19.841 --> 00:58:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Those are all times spectacular moments </v>
<v Speaker 1>in boxing.</v>

1431
00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:24.910
<v Speaker 1>You owe a lot more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1432
00:58:24.911 --> 00:58:28.540
<v Speaker 1>You gotta you gotTa work on that style </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I also hope they don't do well.</v>

1433
00:58:28.541 --> 00:58:29.680
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that,</v>

1434
00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:34.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name as the brother was </v>

1435
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:34.790
<v Speaker 1>fucking brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

1436
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1437
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:35.440
<v Speaker 1>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1438
00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:38.890
<v Speaker 1>he knew the boxing and even if you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell that he probably didn't come from a</v>

1439
00:58:38.891 --> 00:58:39.910
<v Speaker 1>boxing background.</v>

1440
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:42.260
<v Speaker 1>So whatever he started with was from </v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh.</v>

1441
00:58:42.261 --> 00:58:44.410
<v Speaker 1>And to the point that he got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was really good.</v>

1442
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:47.320
<v Speaker 1>It was decent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he also embodied the guy.</v>

1443
00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

1444
00:58:48.131 --> 00:58:49.030
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very well.</v>

1445
00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope they don't do that.</v>

1446
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I hope that this is talking about them </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing fighter to where he will.</v>

1447
00:58:53.261 --> 00:58:56.330
<v Speaker 1>They'll get like Arturo Gotti out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to find,</v>

1448
00:58:56.550 --> 00:59:01.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like really is there to talk about </v>

1449
00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:01.550
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard I,</v>

1450
00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:04.171
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard just through different </v>

1451
00:59:04.171 --> 00:59:04.171
<v Speaker 1>channels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope be.</v>

1452
00:59:04.171 --> 00:59:06.040
<v Speaker 1>That would be stupid to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if they did a good job of it?</v>

1453
00:59:06.041 --> 00:59:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1454
00:59:07.031 --> 00:59:12.031
<v Speaker 1>the idea that never would have thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>this one and this was a good movie and </v>

1455
00:59:12.031 --> 00:59:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Walberg is a good actor when he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>acting.</v>

1456
00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:15.130
<v Speaker 1>But I just felt like in his fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes,</v>

1457
00:59:15.131 --> 00:59:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like it wasn't enough like </v>
<v Speaker 1>micky ward and it wasn't an.</v>

1458
00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:19.240
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't realistic enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1459
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:24.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys get you to hit each other a </v>

1460
00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:24.510
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1461
00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:24.510
<v Speaker 2>I want to see you really get hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1462
00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:26.840
<v Speaker 2>I want to see a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see a slap on to see a fucking</v>

1463
00:59:26.841 --> 00:59:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Jap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knock your hair back,</v>

1464
00:59:28.011 --> 00:59:29.330
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see it real.</v>

1465
00:59:29.331 --> 00:59:30.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't real.</v>

1466
00:59:30.081 --> 00:59:31.160
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>

1467
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:32.780
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the fight scene in the movie,</v>

1468
00:59:32.781 --> 00:59:37.781
<v Speaker 2>my heart and didn't move at all when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>watched that Kevin Jameson and Kevin </v>

1469
00:59:37.781 --> 00:59:40.370
<v Speaker 2>James and mayhem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the pure artistic version.</v>

1470
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:41.810
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they did,</v>

1471
00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:42.060
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1472
00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:44.240
<v Speaker 2>their version of the fight scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1473
00:59:44.241 --> 00:59:46.570
<v Speaker 2>these motherfuckers thought this shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

1474
00:59:46.571 --> 00:59:51.571
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a camera on his chest while </v>

1475
00:59:51.571 --> 00:59:53.531
<v Speaker 2>they're grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like there's wild shot of him </v>

1476
00:59:53.531 --> 00:59:54.080
<v Speaker 2>getting belly to belly suplex from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>camera on his chest.</v>

1477
00:59:54.081 --> 00:59:55.610
<v Speaker 2>Like to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

1478
00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:56.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>

1479
00:59:56.871 --> 00:59:59.630
<v Speaker 2>It cuts from a bunch of different angles</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1480
00:59:59.631 --> 01:00:04.631
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it looks like they're really </v>

1481
01:00:04.631 --> 01:00:04.631
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

1482
01:00:04.631 --> 01:00:04.631
<v Speaker 2>What kind of shape is he in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1483
01:00:04.631 --> 01:00:07.310
<v Speaker 2>You gotta realize 80 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this different shit will.</v>

1491
01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.660
<v Speaker 2>Kevin was on that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>

1492
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:29.240
<v Speaker 2>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dilemma with Vince Vaughn.</v>

1493
01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:32.300
<v Speaker 2>Vince and him became pals and vince was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1494
01:00:32.301 --> 01:00:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1495
01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.400
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking really heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1496
01:00:34.401 --> 01:00:36.170
<v Speaker 2>you've got to do something to Kevin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Kevin,</v>

1497
01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:41.200
<v Speaker 2>I've been friends with Kevin for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and he's been struggling with his </v>

1498
01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.841
<v Speaker 2>weight for 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did a ball cop together and we would </v>

1499
01:00:43.841 --> 01:00:45.380
<v Speaker 2>drive home together in Boston and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have to eat all day.</v>

1500
01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:50.380
<v Speaker 2>He had his own chef and stuff and eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>well all day and then we would hit </v>

1501
01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's and Burger King,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1502
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:53.870
<v Speaker 2>It would be like 30 bucks the bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding you man.</v>

1503
01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.430
<v Speaker 2>He was like Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would kill it.</v>

1504
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:57.850
<v Speaker 2>I could fuck up some food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on.</v>

1505
01:00:57.851 --> 01:00:59.440
<v Speaker 2>And he was so cool about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd be like,</v>

1506
01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:00.350
<v Speaker 2>add,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking good.</v>

1507
01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:01.480
<v Speaker 2>You'd just be eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1508
01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:03.650
<v Speaker 2>like he doesn't have shaman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Kevin did very,</v>

1509
01:01:03.651 --> 01:01:06.140
<v Speaker 2>very honest dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he also realized like,</v>

1510
01:01:06.141 --> 01:01:07.280
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta do something about this.</v>

1511
01:01:07.281 --> 01:01:10.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's been nine months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's had no meat for nine months.</v>

1512
01:01:10.161 --> 01:01:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Everything has been all raw vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything super,</v>

1513
01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:16.520
<v Speaker 2>super healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's ready to go off like a rocket.</v>

1514
01:01:16.521 --> 01:01:18.740
<v Speaker 2>As soon as this filming is over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to eat a whole cow.</v>

1515
01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1516
01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:20.770
<v Speaker 2>He's going to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just going.</v>

1517
01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:22.070
<v Speaker 2>It's rate to Ruth's Chris.</v>

1518
01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:27.220
<v Speaker 2>That's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going to be a car that's going to </v>

1519
01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:27.220
<v Speaker 2>drive them straight to Ruth's Chris </v>
<v Speaker 2>Steakhouse.</v>

1520
01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.630
<v Speaker 2>He's going to get it fucking t bone and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mashed potatoes with gravy,</v>

1521
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:35.390
<v Speaker 2>but he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's lost a tremendous amount of weigh </v>

1522
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:37.190
<v Speaker 2>80 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin has always had like real martial </v>

1523
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:39.881
<v Speaker 2>arts skill and even try to get them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do the podcast because I'm doing the </v>

1524
01:01:39.881 --> 01:01:42.731
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be with him for nine days </v>

1525
01:01:42.731 --> 01:01:46.120
<v Speaker 2>and I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to get them to do the </v>

1526
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:46.550
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's like super private man.</v>

1527
01:01:46.551 --> 01:01:48.750
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't like to talk about shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>publicly.</v>

1528
01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't like to do exposing interviews </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the opposite of me or I'll tell you</v>

1529
01:01:52.971 --> 01:01:54.410
<v Speaker 2>exactly what I'm thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1530
01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:56.210
<v Speaker 2>He's not that kind of a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>

1531
01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:01.300
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a little bit more laid back and </v>

1532
01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:01.300
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to get them to to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's going to willing to</v>

1533
01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.530
<v Speaker 2>do an interview like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the story is very interesting.</v>

1534
01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:07.670
<v Speaker 2>He's lost 80 fucking pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks fantastic or faces all thin.</v>

1535
01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.740
<v Speaker 2>His body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still like a little fat.</v>

1536
01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:11.240
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not shredded.</v>

1537
01:02:11.241 --> 01:02:13.910
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't look like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't really say.</v>

1538
01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:17.480
<v Speaker 2>I saw him recently and now it makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense why it's so thick.</v>

1539
01:02:17.481 --> 01:02:21.240
<v Speaker 2>I may have just gotten him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't fought in a lot of time,</v>

1540
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:26.241
<v Speaker 2>may have got fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These strikeforce morons because mayhem </v>

1541
01:02:26.241 --> 01:02:26.241
<v Speaker 2>got in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>

1542
01:02:26.241 --> 01:02:29.160
<v Speaker 2>There was a fight where jake shields </v>
<v Speaker 2>beat Dan Henderson.</v>

1543
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Awesome fight and it was a big event on </v>
<v Speaker 2>CBS.</v>

1544
01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:36.660
<v Speaker 2>The CBS event though was a disaster </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the production was so </v>

1545
01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.190
<v Speaker 2>unorganized way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1546
01:02:38.191 --> 01:02:43.191
<v Speaker 2>way over the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An hour and a half or something over </v>

1547
01:02:43.191 --> 01:02:43.191
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of time.</v>

1548
01:02:43.191 --> 01:02:44.880
<v Speaker 2>So they went into the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went past the news.</v>

1549
01:02:44.881 --> 01:02:46.650
<v Speaker 2>They wanted some other show that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>very positive.</v>

1550
01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:48.240
<v Speaker 2>It was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so.</v>

1551
01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:50.910
<v Speaker 2>The UFC has never done anything remotely</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this ever.</v>

1552
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:56.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they just don't know what they're </v>

1553
01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:57.351
<v Speaker 2>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were real raw in the game in any </v>

1554
01:02:57.351 --> 01:02:57.660
<v Speaker 2>way may have and jake shields had fought</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a very close decision.</v>

1555
01:02:57.661 --> 01:03:02.661
<v Speaker 2>It was a really good fight and at one </v>
<v Speaker 2>point in time may had jake shields back </v>

1556
01:03:02.661 --> 01:03:04.740
<v Speaker 2>with a rear naked choke in and jake was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going out and the bell rang.</v>

1557
01:03:04.741 --> 01:03:06.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was locked in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a rap.</v>

1558
01:03:06.871 --> 01:03:09.600
<v Speaker 2>There was no way mayhem was letting go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was pumped upon.</v>

1559
01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:12.660
<v Speaker 2>He had the forearm across the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jake was turning red bull.</v>

1560
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:17.750
<v Speaker 2>The bell rang and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wanted a rematch so they let him in </v>

1561
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:21.471
<v Speaker 2>the cage and may have interrupted the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview between Jake shields and the </v>

1562
01:03:21.471 --> 01:03:22.440
<v Speaker 2>commentator Gus Johnson and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1563
01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:23.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about my rematch?</v>

1564
01:03:23.641 --> 01:03:26.100
<v Speaker 2>And then jake shields buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get the fuck out of here.</v>

1565
01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:27.690
<v Speaker 2>And then the nick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nick Diaz,</v>

1566
01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Nate Diaz and Jake and Gilbert Melendez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turned into a fucking bra on CBS.</v>

1567
01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:33.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they blamed man.</v>

1568
01:03:33.931 --> 01:03:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mayhem didn't throw.</v>

1569
01:03:35.131 --> 01:03:39.090
<v Speaker 2>The first punch may haven't got beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on his back and they were kicking</v>

1570
01:03:39.091 --> 01:03:40.060
<v Speaker 2>him in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1571
01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:42.630
<v Speaker 2>And they're blaming him and so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't let him fight again.</v>

1572
01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:47.780
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't fight on showtime and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't fight on CBS and they didn't </v>

1573
01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:47.780
<v Speaker 2>tell him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were pussies about it.</v>

1574
01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:50.540
<v Speaker 2>So for a fucking year this guy has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting doing nothing.</v>

1575

<v Speaker 2>getting bigger.</v>

1576
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.570

<v Speaker 2>was going to figure out how to just </v>

1603
01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:41.200
<v Speaker 2>nurses knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's three weeks away,</v>

1604
01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:45.510
<v Speaker 2>but Frankie Edgar broke his ribs and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when his ribs are broken you can't.</v>

1605
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:48.470
<v Speaker 2>There's no way he's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson Silva actually fought shale son</v>

1606
01:04:48.471 --> 01:04:51.850
<v Speaker 2>and when a broken rib is either a broken</v>
<v Speaker 2>rib or a separated ribs,</v>

1607
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:54.180
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong with his rib.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1608
01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:54.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

1609
01:04:54.841 --> 01:04:55.960
<v Speaker 2>he took it anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1610
01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:57.870
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he felt like he could still pull</v>

1611
01:04:57.871 --> 01:05:00.810
<v Speaker 2>it off and he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with Edgar apparently was too bad.</v>

1612
01:05:00.811 --> 01:05:05.811
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Frankie Edgar and gray maynard is </v>

1613
01:05:05.811 --> 01:05:07.360
<v Speaker 2>going to be moved to somewhere around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they said it,</v>

1614
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:08.820
<v Speaker 2>depending on how everybody heals up.</v>

1615
01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:11.250
<v Speaker 2>It'll be like late summer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early fall,</v>

1616
01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:16.370
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I don't know who the main event </v>

1617
01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:18.711
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to be rampage versus </v>

1618
01:05:18.711 --> 01:05:20.241
<v Speaker 2>Matt Hamill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice rick story versus Thiago Alves a </v>

1619
01:05:20.241 --> 01:05:24.121
<v Speaker 2>big fight on that card too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking nasty fight with a </v>

1620
01:05:24.121 --> 01:05:24.880
<v Speaker 2>bunch of great with the UFC buying </v>
<v Speaker 2>strikeforce.</v>

1621
01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Is that going to be more events now or </v>
<v Speaker 2>just bigger events when you do events?</v>

1622
01:05:28.751 --> 01:05:30.190
<v Speaker 2>A good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As of right now,</v>

1623
01:05:30.191 --> 01:05:35.191
<v Speaker 2>it's a two different companies and as of</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now they own both and so they can </v>

1624
01:05:35.191 --> 01:05:38.860
<v Speaker 2>bring guys over like they brought him </v>
<v Speaker 2>over to the UFC because they own both of</v>

1625
01:05:38.861 --> 01:05:40.840
<v Speaker 2>them and if you fucks aren't gonna fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1626
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:45.870
<v Speaker 2>This guy's one of the most popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters in the world and you idiots </v>

1627
01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:45.870
<v Speaker 2>aren't fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1628
01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:47.890
<v Speaker 2>what kind of nonsense is so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad that he's going to be in the</v>

1629
01:05:47.891 --> 01:05:48.670
<v Speaker 2>UFC finally.</v>

1630
01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:49.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1631
01:05:49.321 --> 01:05:50.890
<v Speaker 2>that'd be huge for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1632
01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:56.160
<v Speaker 2>it'd be huge and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He should have been in the UFC a long </v>

1633
01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:56.160
<v Speaker 2>time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1634
01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:00.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real problem with strikeforce is </v>

1635
01:06:00.061 --> 01:06:00.061
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who said this,</v>

1636
01:06:00.061 --> 01:06:03.070
<v Speaker 2>but it was very astute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said that when you,</v>

1637
01:06:03.071 --> 01:06:04.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you watch strikeforce,</v>

1638
01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:09.810
<v Speaker 2>what was awesome about it was you got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see a lot of knockouts and a lot of </v>

1639
01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:12.841
<v Speaker 2>submissions and sometimes you watch the </v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC and the guys were so evenly matched </v>

1640
01:06:12.841 --> 01:06:14.020
<v Speaker 2>that they kind of cancel each other out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that is true,</v>

1641
01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's because there are mismatches </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1642
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:21.060
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why they're so </v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting is because it's Paul daily </v>

1643
01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.911
<v Speaker 2>versus Scott Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reality is Scott Smith really </v>

1644
01:06:23.911 --> 01:06:26.581
<v Speaker 2>can't stand with Paul daily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it does turn out to be a spectacular </v>

1645
01:06:26.581 --> 01:06:26.581
<v Speaker 2>knockout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1646
01:06:26.581 --> 01:06:27.270
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1647
01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.860
<v Speaker 2>it's better that there's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition,</v>

1648
01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:34.861
<v Speaker 2>it's better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes the fights aren't nearly </v>

1649
01:06:34.861 --> 01:06:35.080
<v Speaker 2>as exciting because these guys cancel </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other out.</v>

1650
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:40.260
<v Speaker 2>But then sometimes when you get to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>baddest motherfuckers in the world and </v>

1651
01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:43.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one guy takes a chance like Anderson </v>

1652
01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Silva versus [inaudible] and it winds up</v>
<v Speaker 2>being ultra spectacular and even worth </v>

1653
01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:48.850
<v Speaker 2>more because you know that these guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>are the best guys in the fucking world,</v>

1654
01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:50.080
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1655
01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:51.250
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1656
01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:52.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all tricky man.</v>

1657
01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:58.350
<v Speaker 2>It's all tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be better to have all </v>

1658
01:06:58.350 --> 01:06:58.450
<v Speaker 2>these fighters in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have to figure out what exactly</v>

1659
01:06:58.451 --> 01:07:03.451
<v Speaker 2>they're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do miss the mismatches of the old UFC </v>

1660
01:07:03.451 --> 01:07:03.451
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1661
01:07:03.451 --> 01:07:05.620
<v Speaker 2>like where it's a black belt in Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus a bartender of the applebee's.</v>

1662
01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:09.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are fun as far as like a,</v>

1663
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:11.380
<v Speaker 2>as a spectacle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1664
01:07:11.381 --> 01:07:16.381
<v Speaker 2>I guess they just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've moved Tiago Alvarez versus Rick </v>

1665
01:07:16.381 --> 01:07:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Story to the main card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of good fights on this</v>

1666
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.880
<v Speaker 2>path.</v>

1667
01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:20.770
<v Speaker 2>Any of those like fight fantasy camps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1668
01:07:20.771 --> 01:07:22.270
<v Speaker 2>they have felt like basketball and </v>
<v Speaker 2>baseball,</v>

1669
01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:24.970
<v Speaker 2>like go down and play with all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yankees and you know,</v>

1670
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But did they go down and get your </v>

1671
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:30.000
<v Speaker 2>fucking brains bashed in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I would do it,</v>

1672
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always show them how to fuck,</v>

1673
01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:32.800
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like training.</v>

1674
01:07:32.801 --> 01:07:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should do something like that.</v>

1675
01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:39.091
<v Speaker 2>It's not a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Miguel Torres versus mighty mouse </v>

1676
01:07:39.091 --> 01:07:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the fucking fight.</v>

1677
01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.950
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>demetrius mighty mouse Johnson,</v>

1678
01:07:41.951 --> 01:07:46.951
<v Speaker 2>he fought on spike TV last time we </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought kid Yamamoto who at one point in </v>

1679
01:07:46.951 --> 01:07:50.521
<v Speaker 2>time was one of the baddest </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers in the world and now he's </v>

1680
01:07:50.521 --> 01:07:51.940
<v Speaker 2>down to his real weight of 135 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could not fuck with this dude.</v>

1681
01:07:51.941 --> 01:07:52.810
<v Speaker 2>This dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mighty mouse.</v>

1682
01:07:52.811 --> 01:07:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Johnson is this tiny little guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>moves faster than I've ever seen anyone.</v>

1683
01:07:57.190 --> 01:08:02.190
<v Speaker 2>He is the perfect reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the perfect like version of the 135</v>

1684
01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:06.730
<v Speaker 2>pound fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want an argument like why do</v>

1685
01:08:06.731 --> 01:08:10.780
<v Speaker 2>they have this 135 pound weight class?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch that guy because there's nobody at</v>

1686
01:08:10.781 --> 01:08:15.040
<v Speaker 2>one 85 can move like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This fucking guy moves like a lightning.</v>

1687
01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 2>Just dive</v>

1688
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:21.160
<v Speaker 1>and under punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His double leg takedown is faster than </v>

1689
01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:21.890
<v Speaker 1>any I've ever seen before and is stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>up as fast as fuck too.</v>

1690
01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:24.320
<v Speaker 1>So this guy is fighting the former </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion,</v>

1691
01:08:24.321 --> 01:08:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Miguel Torres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>

1692
01:08:25.311 --> 01:08:28.040
<v Speaker 1>that's a sick fucking fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that's on the main card.</v>

1693
01:08:28.041 --> 01:08:30.500
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not be.</v>

1694
01:08:30.501 --> 01:08:32.180
<v Speaker 1>It might be a swing bout or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might.</v>

1695
01:08:32.181 --> 01:08:33.030
<v Speaker 1>It might be the spiked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1696
01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.820
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a spike TV fight.</v>

1697
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:36.530
<v Speaker 1>The strikeforce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have girl fighting.</v>

1698
01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do have girlfriend.</v>

1699
01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Did Dana just cancel all that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1700
01:08:40.281 --> 01:08:45.281
<v Speaker 1>he didn't cancel all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had this fighter summit where they </v>

1701
01:08:45.281 --> 01:08:47.681
<v Speaker 1>met and they talked about the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl fights and they talked about </v>

1702
01:08:47.681 --> 01:08:48.220
<v Speaker 1>meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1703
01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I've never called a girl fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to be monitored official </v>

1704
01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:54.490
<v Speaker 1>and you have cough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlton wasn't bars.</v>

1705
01:08:56.670 --> 01:08:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Those are always more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1706
01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:00.800
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1707
01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:05.830
<v Speaker 3>That's why I love watching those youtube</v>
<v Speaker 3>videos of like chicks fighting at </v>

1708
01:09:05.830 --> 01:09:05.830
<v Speaker 3>Denny's and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that one,</v>

1709
01:09:05.830 --> 01:09:10.281
<v Speaker 3>there was all over the place I started </v>
<v Speaker 3>on deadspin because it's just the </v>

1710
01:09:10.281 --> 01:09:10.281
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially when girls fight,</v>

1711
01:09:10.281 --> 01:09:12.600
<v Speaker 3>it's the people you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really give a fuck about how the</v>

1712
01:09:12.601 --> 01:09:17.601
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love watching the peripheral people </v>

1713
01:09:17.601 --> 01:09:17.601
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh bitch,</v>

1714
01:09:17.601 --> 01:09:20.440

1719
01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.900
<v Speaker 1>It was a fight at Denny's where a black </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy was dressed up as Boba Fett,</v>

1720
01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:37.930
<v Speaker 1>like he must have just got off some star</v>
<v Speaker 1>wars convention and stuff and he's just </v>

1721
01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:38.680
<v Speaker 1>sitting there videotaping this booth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next,</v>

1722
01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:43.900
<v Speaker 1>these chicks all fighting with the cop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and suddenly it is one go swings and </v>

1723
01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:45.440

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1726
01:09:48.801 --> 01:09:53.801
<v Speaker 1>trying to be civilized to just smash and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this girl on the ground and just we're </v>

1727
01:09:53.801 --> 01:09:57.010
<v Speaker 1>putting on your Boba Fett costume and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then getting to the ground later on that</v>

1728
01:09:57.010 --> 01:10:01.490
<v Speaker 1>night was that Worldstar hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one website.</v>

1729
01:10:01.491 --> 01:10:06.491
<v Speaker 1>Worldstar hip hop is the conglomeration </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the worst beat downs in the history </v>

1730
01:10:06.491 --> 01:10:09.590
<v Speaker 1>of the Internet dude world still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Esther was just on there the other day.</v>

1731
01:10:09.591 --> 01:10:14.591
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that for her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her video of her asking the sex </v>

1732
01:10:14.591 --> 01:10:15.410
<v Speaker 1>questions as dressed up as a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>

1733
01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:17.440
<v Speaker 1>They had her as the video of the week or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1734
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:19.850
<v Speaker 1>They'll put on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be hip hop related,</v>

1735
01:10:19.851 --> 01:10:23.600
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of it is black people getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck beat out of them and do.</v>

1736
01:10:23.601 --> 01:10:28.601
<v Speaker 1>There's one video or one guy's talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and he gets knocked out and then </v>

1737
01:10:28.601 --> 01:10:32.000
<v Speaker 1>everybody runs by and punches and kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy while he's unconscious,</v>

1738
01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:37.060
<v Speaker 1>it is fucking disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One guy uses his head like a fucking </v>

1739
01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:38.240
<v Speaker 1>soccer ball and it just runs up and boot</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in the head.</v>

1740
01:10:38.250 --> 01:10:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Then another guy comes up and punches </v>
<v Speaker 1>him in the head and they're all doing </v>

1741
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:45.761
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While this guy's unconscious with his </v>

1742
01:10:45.761 --> 01:10:45.761
<v Speaker 1>pants down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to watch,</v>

1743
01:10:45.761 --> 01:10:46.910
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's human beings,</v>

1744
01:10:46.911 --> 01:10:48.590
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they get away with shit,</v>

1745
01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean we see it in a little bit on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

1746
01:10:50.691 --> 01:10:53.570
<v Speaker 1>When people are anonymous and they snipe</v>
<v Speaker 1>at you and say evil,</v>

1747
01:10:53.571 --> 01:10:54.320
<v Speaker 1>mean Shit.</v>

1748
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:56.180
<v Speaker 1>When they know they can get away with </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1749
01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:58.190
<v Speaker 1>You see the weakness of a human's </v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

1750
01:10:58.191 --> 01:11:00.080
<v Speaker 1>You see like the lowest person you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1751
01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:05.360
<v Speaker 1>There's very few things lower than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see a guy who just got knocked the fuck </v>

1752
01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:05.840
<v Speaker 1>out and you just run over and kick him </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the head because you can.</v>

1753
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:11.270
<v Speaker 1>It takes a special kind of fucked up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain human being to do that,</v>

1754
01:11:11.271 --> 01:11:13.650
<v Speaker 1>to dehumanize and unconscious guy like </v>

1786
01:12:44.341 --> 01:12:44.341
<v Speaker 1>on him and pulled a gun on him in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of a set one time.</v>

01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1788
01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Joey Cola was performing at pips in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn and there was a guy sitting in </v>

1789
01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:54.511
<v Speaker 1>the front row that was heckling him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy pulled up his shirt and showed </v>

1790
01:12:54.511 --> 01:12:57.691
<v Speaker 1>him a pistol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there the night holtzman got the </v>

1791
01:12:57.691 --> 01:12:57.850
<v Speaker 1>gun pulled on by the undercover cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1792
01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On.</v>

1793
01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:02.590
<v Speaker 1>He was shooting the cops on that guy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then Holtzman,</v>

1794
01:13:02.591 --> 01:13:04.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was an off duty cop.</v>

1795
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:07.740
<v Speaker 1>The guy pulled the gun out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think he,</v>

1796
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:09.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he showed him what I showed the gun.</v>

1797
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Then holtzman just kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1798
01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:13.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if this is to say,</v>

1799
01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:14.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let it,</v>

1800
01:13:14.561 --> 01:13:19.561
<v Speaker 1>let it happen now if it's gonna happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then left and then the guy was in </v>

1801
01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:20.230
<v Speaker 1>the memories of the parking lot walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and his girlfriend's air.</v>

1802
01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:25.380
<v Speaker 1>That's when he pulled a gun out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when we called the cops and the </v>

1803
01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:26.590
<v Speaker 1>cops took him around the corner behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>the House of Blues and let them go.</v>

1804
01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they did the big dog and pony show,</v>

1805
01:13:28.601 --> 01:13:30.730
<v Speaker 1>put them in the back of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handcuffed.</v>

1806
01:13:30.731 --> 01:13:32.740
<v Speaker 1>And then we followed them around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd let him.</v>

1807
01:13:32.770 --> 01:13:34.990
<v Speaker 1>They let him go behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had his wife come pick them up.</v>

1808
01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1810
01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:38.800

<v Speaker 1>cops have to look out for their own.</v>

1811
01:13:38.801 --> 01:13:41.200
<v Speaker 1>But that's an embarrassing moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was wasted.</v>

1812
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:43.240
<v Speaker 1>That's so weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No one's going to call the police.</v>

1820
01:13:55.630 --> 01:14:00.630
<v Speaker 1>He did it just with what a silly man </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks he's going to be able to pull a </v>

01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm used to park on the ramp and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>come in and out at the sky and</v>

1829
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.070
<v Speaker 2>they've come and watch the show and hang</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and yeah.</v>

1830
01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:14.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1831
01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:19.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they all do my truck and he </v>

1832
01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:19.940
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does it smell like weed in your car?</v>

1833
01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:21.310
<v Speaker 2>I go because I smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good weed kind of question.</v>

1834
01:14:21.311 --> 01:14:23.250
<v Speaker 2>Is that it's smelly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1835
01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:29.580
<v Speaker 2>I think they worked at Kimmel to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Paris was friends with like they </v>

1836
01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:32.611
<v Speaker 2>do security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I used to hook those guys up with a </v>

1837
01:14:32.611 --> 01:14:32.611
<v Speaker 2>UFC tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

1838
01:14:32.611 --> 01:14:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were cool as fuck.</v>

1839
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1840
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:38.520
<v Speaker 2>who likes watching dudes beat the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of each other more than cops and </v>

1841
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:42.210
<v Speaker 2>they're all martial artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known so many cops from Jujitsu.</v>

1842
01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:44.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a cop man,</v>

1843
01:14:44.081 --> 01:14:49.081
<v Speaker 2>you better learn how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You better learn something at some </v>

1844
01:14:49.081 --> 01:14:49.081
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to have to have to.</v>

1845
01:14:49.081 --> 01:14:52.870
<v Speaker 2>When I see a guy who like completely out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of shape and like he obviously not </v>

1846
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:53.710
<v Speaker 2>skilled and he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a cop.</v>

1847
01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:55.690
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a scary place to be,</v>

1848
01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:57.520
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's scary to be a cop anyway,</v>

1849
01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.570
<v Speaker 2>but it's really scary to be a cop where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you pull your gun out,</v>

1850
01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:01.180
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

1851
01:15:01.181 --> 01:15:02.500
<v Speaker 2>click.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bullets don't work.</v>

1852
01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:04.780
<v Speaker 2>You're unarmed and he's armed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what?</v>

1853
01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:10.140
<v Speaker 2>That's scary as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know there was a video of a guy </v>

1854
01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:10.830
<v Speaker 2>getting loose in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a,</v>

1855
01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.840
<v Speaker 2>they were handcuffing him and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing them somewhere and there was </v>

1856
01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.950
<v Speaker 2>two cops and he just starts beating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck out of these two cops.</v>

1857
01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.010
<v Speaker 2>And they were so helpless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did not know how to fight.</v>

1858
01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:23.470
<v Speaker 2>The guy tries to grab a hold of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have any technique.</v>

1859
01:15:23.650 --> 01:15:25.810
<v Speaker 2>He probably never been blasted in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>face before,</v>

1860
01:15:25.811 --> 01:15:28.210
<v Speaker 2>so he's freaking the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He realizes this wild,</v>

1861
01:15:28.211 --> 01:15:31.760
<v Speaker 2>crazy prisoner is teeing off on him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then the other guy tries to jump on him.</v>

1862
01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:34.120
<v Speaker 2>He blasts the other guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was ugly.</v>

1863
01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.190
<v Speaker 2>This guy beat the fuck out of two </v>
<v Speaker 2>security guards.</v>

1864
01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Beat the fuck out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unconscious.</v>

1865
01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.330
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought two guys would be enough to</v>

1866
01:15:40.331 --> 01:15:45.331
<v Speaker 2>contain them because they didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to fight to debt must be the most </v>

1867
01:15:45.331 --> 01:15:48.250
<v Speaker 2>terrifying place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not knowing how to fight and being stuck</v>

1868
01:15:48.251 --> 01:15:52.030
<v Speaker 2>with a crazy prisoner who just nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to lose man.</v>

1869
01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.920
<v Speaker 2>Especially if the guys like in for </v>
<v Speaker 2>murder.</v>

1870
01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys that are in for life or what?</v>

1871
01:15:56.650 --> 01:15:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1872
01:15:57.201 --> 01:15:59.680
<v Speaker 2>What do they have to lose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get more life.</v>

1873
01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:04.150
<v Speaker 2>What a weird fucking life that must be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever watched those movies?</v>

1874
01:16:04.151 --> 01:16:06.340
<v Speaker 2>Are those documentaries where they go </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a.</v>

1875
01:16:06.370 --> 01:16:08.470
<v Speaker 2>like there was one of them where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>went into this.</v>

1876
01:16:08.471 --> 01:16:11.410
<v Speaker 2>One guy was stabbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy was all on camera,</v>

1877
01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:13.150
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary was,</v>

1878
01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.520
<v Speaker 2>but he was stabbing this guy in the eye.</v>

1879
01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Look over and over and over and over </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1880
01:16:18.071 --> 01:16:23.071
<v Speaker 2>He was stabbing this guy and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming out white power and he jumped </v>

1881
01:16:23.071 --> 01:16:26.491
<v Speaker 2>up and then some white power jumping off</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this motherfucker and this guy is on </v>

1882
01:16:26.491 --> 01:16:28.390
<v Speaker 2>the ground like barely alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 fucking holes in his head.</v>

1883
01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:31.630
<v Speaker 2>He's just stabbing them over and over </v>
<v Speaker 2>again in the head.</v>

1884
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:33.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1885
01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.130
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a totally different world.</v>

1886
01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's levels,</v>

1887
01:16:38.351 --> 01:16:42.160
<v Speaker 2>there's a spectrum of human behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you see that spectrum,</v>

1888
01:16:42.161 --> 01:16:45.640
<v Speaker 2>when you see like that Mexican lady last</v>
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

1889
01:16:45.641 --> 01:16:47.980
<v Speaker 2>there was a video of some cartel woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>shopping.</v>

1890
01:16:47.981 --> 01:16:51.100
<v Speaker 2>Some guy's head off slowly and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>skinny his face.</v>

1891
01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:53.190
<v Speaker 2>They skin his face and then they show </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1892
01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:55.870
<v Speaker 2>put it all on video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get to that level,</v>

1893
01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.090
<v Speaker 2>there's levels of humanity where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

1894
01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:03.240
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you hear about like what Vlad </v>

1895
01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:06.541
<v Speaker 2>the impaler used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy that was responsible for the </v>

1896
01:17:06.541 --> 01:17:09.770
<v Speaker 2>legend of Dracula,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the legend of Dracula came from an </v>

1897
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:10.460
<v Speaker 2>actual man who was such a ruthless </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>

1898
01:17:10.590 --> 01:17:13.610
<v Speaker 2>They do would impale people on sticks </v>
<v Speaker 2>and keep their head on a stick,</v>

1899
01:17:13.611 --> 01:17:14.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their whole body,</v>

1900
01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:19.631
<v Speaker 2>their head parts of their body and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would eat them and eat their flesh </v>

1901
01:17:19.631 --> 01:17:20.330
<v Speaker 2>flashing would force them to eat each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

1902
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:23.180
<v Speaker 2>He would cut their pieces up and cook it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and feed into each other.</v>

1903
01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when people would,</v>

1904
01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.660
<v Speaker 2>it would leave them up there for months </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people would come over,</v>

1905
01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:29.120
<v Speaker 2>know his house like yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking some people are killed the other</v>

1906
01:17:29.121 --> 01:17:32.640

<v Speaker 2>everybody knew he was a bad motherfucker</v>

1907
01:17:32.641 --> 01:17:35.570
<v Speaker 2>and do not fuck with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking shit to the next level.</v>

1908
01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:42.940
<v Speaker 2>You may be willing to die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he'd be willing to be put on a </v>

1909
01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:44.390
<v Speaker 2>fucking stick and have me for the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>three days when things happen.</v>

1910
01:17:44.391 --> 01:17:49.391
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you hear about like people kicking </v>

1911
01:17:49.391 --> 01:17:49.391

<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1912
01:17:49.391 --> 01:17:49.391
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the highest,</v>

1913
01:17:49.391 --> 01:17:53.201
<v Speaker 2>scariest notches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the scariest things that I </v>

1914
01:17:53.201 --> 01:17:53.201
<v Speaker 2>ever read was about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1915
01:17:53.201 --> 01:17:57.310
<v Speaker 2>people that had arrived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first people that arrived in </v>

1916
01:17:57.310 --> 01:18:00.700
<v Speaker 2>encountered native Americans and some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucked up things they did to the </v>

1917
01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:02.880
<v Speaker 2>native American babies dash their heads </v>
<v Speaker 2>on rocks.</v>

1918
01:18:02.881 --> 01:18:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Like pick them up by their feet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dashed on the rocks.</v>

1919
01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:09.880
<v Speaker 2>And there was all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the Columbus man in Columbus is </v>

1920
01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:11.921
<v Speaker 2>boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude Columbus was essentially a mass </v>

1921
01:18:11.921 --> 01:18:14.261
<v Speaker 2>murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbus was essentially a serial </v>

1922
01:18:14.261 --> 01:18:14.261
<v Speaker 2>killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1923
01:18:14.261 --> 01:18:14.261
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1924
01:18:14.261 --> 01:18:14.630
<v Speaker 2>what those people had done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbia's.</v>

1925
01:18:14.631 --> 01:18:16.580
<v Speaker 2>And then the people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that came with him,</v>

1926
01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:18.740
<v Speaker 2>what they had done to the native </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans that were there.</v>

1927
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:20.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there was resistance,</v>

1928
01:18:20.691 --> 01:18:21.110
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1929
01:18:21.111 --> 01:18:26.111
<v Speaker 2>the native Americans attacked first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno what the fuck started it all </v>

1930
01:18:26.111 --> 01:18:29.081
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you really go into like the </v>

1931
01:18:29.081 --> 01:18:29.120
<v Speaker 2>ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was writing a script once,</v>

1932
01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:30.500
<v Speaker 2>at one point in time was writing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

1933
01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:34.290
<v Speaker 2>a Werewolf movie about the old West.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a long time ago,</v>

1934
01:18:34.291 --> 01:18:36.290
<v Speaker 2>like 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as as I'm writing this,</v>

1935
01:18:36.291 --> 01:18:39.980
<v Speaker 2>I started really getting into the old </v>
<v Speaker 2>west and reading all these stories about</v>

1936
01:18:39.981 --> 01:18:44.981
<v Speaker 2>all these different battles and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking brutality on both sides.</v>

1937
01:18:45.531 --> 01:18:50.531
<v Speaker 2>The brutality that the horrible shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people would do were American </v>

1938
01:18:50.531 --> 01:18:53.450
<v Speaker 2>soldiers would cut the pussy out of dead</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a American Indians,</v>

1939
01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:55.730
<v Speaker 2>cut their pussy out and wear it on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>hats.</v>

1940
01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:57.860
<v Speaker 2>I was like a thing that they did all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1941
01:18:59.210 --> 01:19:00.740
<v Speaker 2>That's probably why they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1942
01:19:00.741 --> 01:19:02.540
<v Speaker 2>Because they turned to their other </v>
<v Speaker 2>buddies and your body's.</v>

1943
01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:07.070
<v Speaker 2>It probably is why the reaction still </v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't changed.</v>

1944
01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.640
<v Speaker 2>It's also to let people know that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1945
01:19:09.670 --> 01:19:12.980
<v Speaker 2>you're taking shit to the next level and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1946
01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:16.640
<v Speaker 2>and everybody has this romanticized </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision of how the American Indians lived</v>

1947
01:19:16.641 --> 01:19:21.641
<v Speaker 2>and they were in peace and harmony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no because they weren't </v>

1948
01:19:21.641 --> 01:19:23.450
<v Speaker 2>impatient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harmony with themselves all the time.</v>

1949
01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.400
<v Speaker 2>The Sioux Indians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1950
01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.020
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the term sue,</v>

1951
01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:30.050
<v Speaker 2>that's not what they call themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call themselves as look.</v>

1952
01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.180
<v Speaker 2>The Cota,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were the Lakota people.</v>

1953
01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:35.390
<v Speaker 2>The other Indians called them the sue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because sue means enemy,</v>

1954
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:41.290
<v Speaker 2>so there is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because these motherfuckers would just </v>

1955
01:19:41.290 --> 01:19:43.811
<v Speaker 2>the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>baddest motherfuckers and they would </v>

1956
01:19:43.811 --> 01:19:45.491
<v Speaker 2>come in and kick ass on the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>Indians and rape their women and kill </v>

1957
01:19:45.491 --> 01:19:45.960
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they called them to sue sue,</v>

1958
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.460
<v Speaker 2>what a weird way to live though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Riding around on animals,</v>

1959
01:19:49.461 --> 01:19:52.610
<v Speaker 2>shooting fucking pointed sticks at other</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals with my pussy hat.</v>

1960
01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:57.700
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they didn't even have horses until </v>

1961
01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:57.750
<v Speaker 2>the Spaniards arrived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until they brought them over.</v>

1962
01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:03.280
<v Speaker 2>When the Europeans arrived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when they started riding horses </v>

1963
01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.720
<v Speaker 2>before they were living like this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>nomadic life of thousands of years ago.</v>

1964
01:20:05.721 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Like they had nothing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have the wheel,</v>

1965
01:20:08.041 --> 01:20:13.041
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have shit happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were living in this weird </v>

1966
01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:13.041
<v Speaker 2>harmonious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like animal,</v>

1967
01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:15.000
<v Speaker 2>like advanced animal life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1968
01:20:15.150 --> 01:20:15.720
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1969
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:20.750
<v Speaker 2>they would do a lot of hunts where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would do hunts by exhaustion where they </v>

1970
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:25.461
<v Speaker 2>would follow a deer and a warrior would </v>
<v Speaker 2>chase a deer down and literally run at </v>

1971
01:20:26.101 --> 01:20:29.100
<v Speaker 2>that deer until that deer died of </v>
<v Speaker 2>exhaustion.</v>

1972
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:31.620
<v Speaker 2>And then they would kill it and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would all eat it,</v>

1973
01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:36.300
<v Speaker 2>but they would chase them for miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just were in such incredible shape.</v>

1974
01:20:36.450 --> 01:20:38.910
<v Speaker 2>And they had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they had to do this to stay alive.</v>

1975
01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:40.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you don't want to have,</v>

1976
01:20:40.450 --> 01:20:45.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you don't have a horse to chase </v>

1977
01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:45.450
<v Speaker 2>after something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to chase after it on foot,</v>

1978
01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:47.410
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if maybe your bows and arrows suck,</v>

1979
01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you haven't figured that out yet.</v>

1980
01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:52.500
<v Speaker 2>So you're living like people live </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands and thousands of years ago.</v>

1981
01:20:52.650 --> 01:20:56.010
<v Speaker 2>So in Europe they had written language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had culture,</v>

1982
01:20:56.011 --> 01:21:01.011
<v Speaker 2>they had plays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had all this shit going on there </v>

1983
01:21:01.011 --> 01:21:03.090
<v Speaker 2>were so advanced as far as society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you would come to North America</v>

1984
01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:06.300
<v Speaker 2>and there was savages like literally I </v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

1985
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:08.040
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes I'm so tired,</v>

1986
01:21:08.041 --> 01:21:09.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even going to walk to the store.</v>

1987
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:12.960
<v Speaker 2>Just the shit that I was already been </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed for me.</v>

1988
01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1989
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:19.310
<v Speaker 2>And then you got to get out of the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched true grit the other day to </v>

1990
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.310
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>

1991
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:23.570
<v Speaker 2>It was a good man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The new one is good and he's a good </v>

1992
01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:23.570
<v Speaker 2>actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Jeff Bridges,</v>

1993
01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1994
01:21:23.611 --> 01:21:25.560
<v Speaker 2>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really good.</v>

1995
01:21:25.561 --> 01:21:30.561
<v Speaker 2>Matt Damon was going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was good and the little girl </v>

1996
01:21:30.561 --> 01:21:30.561
<v Speaker 2>was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good move.</v>

1997
01:21:30.561 --> 01:21:31.560
<v Speaker 2>That was her first thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't really an episode of like,</v>

1998
01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:34.440
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like modern family and the miss.</v>

1999
01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:37.110
<v Speaker 2>She's fucking good man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She can act her ass off.</v>

2000
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:40.680
<v Speaker 2>But you look at that movie and you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hardships of the time,</v>

2001
01:21:40.681 --> 01:21:42.440
<v Speaker 2>like how people were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2002
01:21:42.441 --> 01:21:47.441
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you know with the ship they had to </v>

2003
01:21:47.441 --> 01:21:47.640
<v Speaker 2>go through back then just just riding </v>
<v Speaker 2>around on animals.</v>

2004
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:51.570
<v Speaker 2>Like just that alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get on this stupid stinky train that</v>

2005
01:21:51.571 --> 01:21:54.270
<v Speaker 2>goes like 30 miles an hour or you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to ride an animal.</v>

2006
01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Your call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your call,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know you get a cold.</v>

2008
01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most likely you're going to die.</v>

2009
01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:03.930
<v Speaker 2>That reminds me your joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2010
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.580
<v Speaker 2>I probably don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it anymore.</v>

2011
01:22:05.581 --> 01:22:07.710
<v Speaker 2>The one we were like an half your </v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

2012
01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:10.800

<v Speaker 2>half,</v>

2013
01:22:10.801 --> 01:22:12.660
<v Speaker 2>your family's going to die on the trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2014
01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.330
<v Speaker 2>Half of you are going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're never going to make it.</v>

2015
01:22:15.450 --> 01:22:16.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2016
01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:21.990

<v Speaker 2>but I don't remember what stage court </v>

2017
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:23.610
<v Speaker 2>dates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing.</v>

2018
01:22:23.611 --> 01:22:24.900
<v Speaker 2>You were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where we live now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're like the.</v>

2021
01:22:27.921 --> 01:22:30.870
<v Speaker 2>I love the idea was the only people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Paducah,</v>

2022
01:22:30.871 --> 01:22:35.871
<v Speaker 2>Kentucky aren't in Paducah because </v>
<v Speaker 2>producers the shit in Paducah because </v>

2023
01:22:35.871 --> 01:22:37.380
<v Speaker 2>there were walking across the country </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when went food hood.</v>

2024
01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:39.360
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stub here and fuck,</v>

2025
01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:42.810
<v Speaker 2>and they just stayed in some shitty </v>
<v Speaker 2>spot.</v>

2026
01:22:43.290 --> 01:22:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck would want to just keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it though?</v>

2027
01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:48.590
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard because you know you would.</v>

2028
01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:49.830
<v Speaker 2>You would survive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2029
01:22:49.831 --> 01:22:52.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you watch lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all makes sense.</v>

2030
01:22:52.111 --> 01:22:54.840
<v Speaker 2>They crash on this plane that crashed </v>
<v Speaker 2>their plane on this island.</v>

2031
01:22:55.050 --> 01:22:57.750
<v Speaker 2>The survivors learn how to eat coconuts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what we do now.</v>

2032
01:22:57.751 --> 01:22:59.580
<v Speaker 2>Our society is here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where we live now.</v>

2033
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:01.080
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense,</v>

2034
01:23:01.081 --> 01:23:02.880
<v Speaker 2>but that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what you would do to,</v>

2035
01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:06.580
<v Speaker 2>you would form some new society and new </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the woods,</v>

2036
01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:11.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you would figure out how to fucking </v>

2037
01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:12.880
<v Speaker 2>use coconuts to go retrieve water from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the little little fountain.</v>

2038
01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:14.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we do now.</v>

2039
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:16.630
<v Speaker 2>You would do it until you died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2040
01:23:16.631 --> 01:23:18.520
<v Speaker 2>because the alternative is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you gonna do?</v>

2041
01:23:18.521 --> 01:23:23.521
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna commit suicide and get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the highest cliff and dropped down and </v>

2042
01:23:23.521 --> 01:23:26.640
<v Speaker 2>bash your head on the rocks because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't handle what thousands of years of </v>

2043
01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:26.640
<v Speaker 2>people have handled before you.</v>

2044
01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.790
<v Speaker 2>It may not be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2045
01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:30.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get Suntan.</v>

2046
01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:33.620
<v Speaker 2>I'll burn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have two days of fat.</v>

2047
01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:35.290

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2048
01:23:35.291 --> 01:23:38.280
<v Speaker 2>but I'm half Irish and the Irish is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominated.</v>

2049
01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Burn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I burned dude,</v>

2050
01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:42.250
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know like in my mind I'm like,</v>

2051
01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:43.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll figure it out.</v>

2052
01:23:43.631 --> 01:23:45.460
<v Speaker 2>But I got a week of fucking sunburned </v>
<v Speaker 2>anatomy.</v>

2053
01:23:45.670 --> 01:23:48.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta stay in the Sun.</v>

2054
01:23:48.521 --> 01:23:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Where are you going to poop all over you</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

2055
01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:53.710
<v Speaker 2>It's weird how human beings have evolved</v>
<v Speaker 2>to different climates.</v>

2056
01:23:53.711 --> 01:23:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go to Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone in Ireland is white,</v>

2057
01:23:56.181 --> 01:23:59.050
<v Speaker 2>white paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white as fuck because it's rainy all the</v>

2058
01:23:59.051 --> 01:24:00.760
<v Speaker 2>time and they don't have to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the clouds.</v>

2059
01:24:00.761 --> 01:24:03.240
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to deal with the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no sticky teas.</v>

2060
01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:08.700
<v Speaker 2>But then you know when you get a place </v>
<v Speaker 2>like America and it's like this weird </v>

2061
01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:11.670
<v Speaker 2>melting pot and people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their genetics have come from all these </v>

2062
01:24:11.670 --> 01:24:11.670
<v Speaker 2>different places and now now all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mix it together.</v>

2063
01:24:11.670 --> 01:24:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Some strange environments where you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>like blonde people in Phoenix.</v>

2064
01:24:15.210 --> 01:24:20.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a blonde person living in </v>

2065
01:24:20.210 --> 01:24:20.210
<v Speaker 2>Phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arizona,</v>

2066
01:24:20.210 --> 01:24:22.980
<v Speaker 2>you got exactly 10 hours every year of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being in the sun getting baked down </v>

2067
01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.120
<v Speaker 2>before you start developing cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2068
01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:26.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2069
01:24:26.941 --> 01:24:27.520
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better.</v>

2070
01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:30.670
<v Speaker 2>You get 365 days of the year and add </v>
<v Speaker 2>those days.</v>

2071
01:24:30.671 --> 01:24:35.350
<v Speaker 2>You got about 10 hours were maybe if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>ration it off over the course of a year,</v>

2072
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:40.470
<v Speaker 2>you can survive being outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to be some sort of a </v>

2073
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:41.100
<v Speaker 2>fucking farmer or if you like fishing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your,</v>

2074
01:24:41.101 --> 01:24:41.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2075
01:24:41.521 --> 01:24:46.521
<v Speaker 2>your arms are always outside in the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to develop some weird shit </v>

2076
01:24:46.521 --> 01:24:46.521
<v Speaker 2>on your arm now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2077
01:24:46.521 --> 01:24:47.980
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's radiation,</v>

2078
01:24:47.981 --> 01:24:52.981
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen like I've been on boats </v>

2079
01:24:52.981 --> 01:24:55.171
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fishermen you talking about like </v>

2080
01:24:55.171 --> 01:24:55.171
<v Speaker 2>that dudes that looked like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just like when they take their shirt</v>

2081
01:24:55.171 --> 01:24:56.650
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like their arms and their face.</v>

2082
01:24:56.650 --> 01:24:58.660
<v Speaker 2>Thousand years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking leather bags,</v>

2083
01:24:59.010 --> 01:24:59.710
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2084
01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.570
<v Speaker 2>thousand years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being in the sun all the time.</v>

2085
01:25:01.571 --> 01:25:03.310
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

2086
01:25:03.311 --> 01:25:06.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like this giant nuclear explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's millions of miles away.</v>

2087
01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:08.500
<v Speaker 2>It keeps us alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also wants to kill us.</v>

2088
01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:10.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need it,</v>

2089
01:25:10.301 --> 01:25:13.240
<v Speaker 2>but it wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wants us to die and if we move just a</v>

2090
01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:18.241
<v Speaker 2>little bit too far away from it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we freeze to death a little bit too </v>

2091
01:25:18.241 --> 01:25:22.180
<v Speaker 2>close and all the water evaporates and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we cook the delicate balance.</v>

2092
01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:27.270
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only reason why we're able to live </v>

2093
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.700
<v Speaker 2>on this planet in this environment is </v>
<v Speaker 2>stable at all,</v>

2094
01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:30.490
<v Speaker 2>is because of our moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our Moon is so large.</v>

2095
01:25:30.491 --> 01:25:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Our Moon is one quarter of the size of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth and it's in a stationary orbit</v>

2096
01:25:34.601 --> 01:25:39.601
<v Speaker 2>and it keeps our orbit stationary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gravity interacts with our gravity </v>

2097
01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:43.250
<v Speaker 2>and it keeps us in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a stable path where every year we're,</v>

2098
01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:48.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get too cold and it goes and </v>

2099
01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:48.300
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get too hot.</v>

2100
01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:48.300
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't vary too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other planets,</v>

2101
01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:52.470
<v Speaker 2>some planets have elliptical orbits </v>
<v Speaker 2>where their distance between the sun </v>

2102
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.470
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2103
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:53.740
<v Speaker 2>and rapidly grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2104
01:25:53.741 --> 01:25:55.270
<v Speaker 2>radically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2105
01:25:55.271 --> 01:25:57.900
<v Speaker 2>and it's also like the angle that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn,</v>

2106
01:25:58.010 --> 01:26:01.180
<v Speaker 2>like the moon doesn't turn the moon is </v>
<v Speaker 2>it follows us.</v>

2107
01:26:01.181 --> 01:26:03.680
<v Speaker 2>The same face faces us all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2108
01:26:03.681 --> 01:26:08.681
<v Speaker 2>it spins around with us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it spins around with us with the </v>

2109
01:26:08.681 --> 01:26:09.740
<v Speaker 2>same look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas other planets spin,</v>

2110
01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:13.730
<v Speaker 2>they spin and they have crazy orbits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at the orbits,</v>

2111
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:16.190
<v Speaker 2>we would think that orbits would all be </v>
<v Speaker 2>circular,</v>

2112
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.610
<v Speaker 2>but they're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

2113
01:26:17.630 --> 01:26:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I've just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2114
01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:21.860
<v Speaker 2>I just started realizing this when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started studying all those Zacharias and</v>

2115
01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:24.560
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started talking about a new bureau,</v>

2116
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:29.590
<v Speaker 2>this ancient Sumerian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the oldest known civilization as far </v>

2117
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:30.230
<v Speaker 2>as like written language and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematics.</v>

2118
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:32.870
<v Speaker 2>They talked according to the hitching </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

2119
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:36.470
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have doubted what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>says and have contradicted him,</v>

2120
01:26:36.471 --> 01:26:39.260
<v Speaker 2>but he said that there was a planet that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was 3000,</v>

2121
01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:42.280
<v Speaker 2>600 miles away or 300,</v>
<v Speaker 2>3000,</v>

2122
01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:43.700
<v Speaker 2>3000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>600 years.</v>

2123
01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:48.820
<v Speaker 2>This planet that's on this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>elliptical orbit comes between Mars and </v>

2124
01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:52.511
<v Speaker 2>Jupiter and that there's an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought about this and I was like our </v>

2125
01:26:52.511 --> 01:26:56.801
<v Speaker 2>planet's elliptical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is that even possible that </v>

2126
01:26:56.801 --> 01:27:00.071
<v Speaker 2>something would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you want to know what elliptical </v>

2127
01:27:00.071 --> 01:27:00.071
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elliptical is like.</v>

2128
01:27:00.071 --> 01:27:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Nascar is instead of a circle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2129
01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.270
<v Speaker 2>it's like a long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2130
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:03.450
<v Speaker 2>an oval.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2131
01:27:03.451 --> 01:27:04.640
<v Speaker 2>like an oval.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2132
01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:09.670
<v Speaker 2>apparently there's a lot of planet third</v>
<v Speaker 2>elliptical a lot and binary star </v>

2133
01:27:09.670 --> 01:27:14.111
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of binary star systems </v>

2134
01:27:14.111 --> 01:27:14.111
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

2135
01:27:14.111 --> 01:27:16.930
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they suspect might be outside of </v>

2136
01:27:16.930 --> 01:27:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Pluto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's all this speculation lately</v>

2137
01:27:17.871 --> 01:27:22.871
<v Speaker 2>about there's something wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moon's gravity and the way the moon's </v>

2138
01:27:22.871 --> 01:27:26.921
<v Speaker 2>orbit is that it's reflective of some </v>
<v Speaker 2>are larger body in the solar system and </v>

2139
01:27:26.921 --> 01:27:30.791
<v Speaker 2>there's also a lot of evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something called the galactic shelf and </v>

2140
01:27:30.791 --> 01:27:30.791
<v Speaker 2>the Kuyper belt.</v>

2141
01:27:30.791 --> 01:27:31.940
<v Speaker 2>And all these asteroids that are around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2142
01:27:31.941 --> 01:27:35.030
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real outskirts of our solar system,</v>

2143
01:27:35.031 --> 01:27:40.031
<v Speaker 2>like outside of Pluto or apparently </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a big dropoff and they're </v>

2144
01:27:40.031 --> 01:27:44.140
<v Speaker 2>really quite sure that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>large body out there and it's probably </v>

2145
01:27:44.241 --> 01:27:49.130
<v Speaker 2>four times the size of Jupiter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least Jupiter is fucking enormous.</v>

2146
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:52.670
<v Speaker 2>So they think that this might be a brown</v>
<v Speaker 2>dwarf star,</v>

2147
01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:55.370
<v Speaker 2>that we might actually have a binary </v>
<v Speaker 2>star system,</v>

2148
01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:58.400
<v Speaker 2>but that this other star is way the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

2149
01:27:58.401 --> 01:28:02.300
<v Speaker 2>And it's like it's a brown dwarf and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess you can't see them that well.</v>

2150
01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:05.450
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's very difficult to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out where the fuck it is and spot it and</v>

2151
01:28:05.451 --> 01:28:08.030
<v Speaker 2>they haven't been able to locate it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's so little.</v>

2152
01:28:08.031 --> 01:28:10.340
<v Speaker 2>We know about this whole fucking thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we live in.</v>

2153
01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:13.280
<v Speaker 2>Look how long it's been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And look how we've,</v>

2154
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:14.420
<v Speaker 2>we haven't even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2155
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:16.190
<v Speaker 2>we haven't sent the human to Mars.</v>

2156
01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.610
<v Speaker 2>That's technically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the whole thing,</v>

2157
01:28:19.611 --> 01:28:24.611
<v Speaker 2>it's like our backs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't even gone off our back porch </v>

2158
01:28:24.611 --> 01:28:27.251
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even into the fucking yard or the pool </v>

2159
01:28:27.251 --> 01:28:27.251
<v Speaker 2>or wherever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

2160
01:28:27.251 --> 01:28:28.760
<v Speaker 2>And most people believe we went to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moon.</v>

2161
01:28:28.761 --> 01:28:32.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm skeptical still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in that sounds ridiculous to say,</v>

2162
01:28:32.241 --> 01:28:34.880
<v Speaker 2>but we haven't been back since 1972,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2163
01:28:34.881 --> 01:28:37.480
<v Speaker 2>and I know people say so if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>funding's yeah,</v>

2164
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:41.150
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me like there's some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>shenanigans going on.</v>

2165
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:42.670
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've looked very,</v>

2166
01:28:42.671 --> 01:28:47.671
<v Speaker 2>very closely at the whole moon landing </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and it's a ridiculous subject to </v>

2167
01:28:47.671 --> 01:28:50.390
<v Speaker 2>bring up because even me saying it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing my own voice questioning it,</v>

2168
01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:52.910
<v Speaker 2>I sound like a retard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sound like a retard to me,</v>

2169
01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:54.990
<v Speaker 2>but I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still can't buy it.</v>

2170
01:28:54.991 --> 01:28:56.360
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>

2171
01:28:56.630 --> 01:28:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>69,</v>

2172
01:28:57.650 --> 01:28:59.180
<v Speaker 2>1972.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were seven trips.</v>

2173
01:28:59.181 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Six successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the only time in human history that</v>

2174
01:29:02.011 --> 01:29:05.010
<v Speaker 2>humans have been above 400 miles of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth's surface.</v>

2175
01:29:05.010 --> 01:29:07.950
<v Speaker 2>Only the Apollo missions in the Apollo </v>
<v Speaker 2>missions before that as well.</v>

2176
01:29:08.190 --> 01:29:09.330
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2177
01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:14.450
<v Speaker 2>no biological entity from the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States ever went into space and came </v>

2178
01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:17.931
<v Speaker 2>back alive except humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We never even sent a chicken around the </v>

2179
01:29:17.931 --> 01:29:21.471
<v Speaker 2>moon and see if it survives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just threw them out into deep space </v>

2180
01:29:21.471 --> 01:29:22.940
<v Speaker 2>and threw them out into an extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>radiation and,</v>

2181
01:29:22.941 --> 01:29:25.890
<v Speaker 2>and they returned successfully every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single time and yet we haven't been able</v>

2182
01:29:25.891 --> 01:29:30.300
<v Speaker 2>to go back since 1972.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every other man made or a manned mission</v>

2183
01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:34.080
<v Speaker 2>from that point on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only been up to 400 miles,</v>

2184
01:29:34.081 --> 01:29:36.060
<v Speaker 2>like under 400 miles of the earth's </v>
<v Speaker 2>surface.</v>

2185
01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:41.210
<v Speaker 2>They went 260,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles out and back would have did it in </v>

2186
01:29:41.210 --> 01:29:45.081
<v Speaker 2>72 men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 69 to 72 and people will say </v>

2187
01:29:45.081 --> 01:29:45.081
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We to have you.</v>

2188
01:29:45.081 --> 01:29:45.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2189
01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:48.210
<v Speaker 2>they would've pulled the trigger and </v>
<v Speaker 2>told on us if that was the case.</v>

2190
01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:53.290
<v Speaker 2>May Be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But who the fuck knows what kind of </v>

2191
01:29:53.290 --> 01:29:54.210
<v Speaker 2>weird shit goes on when people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually running countries?</v>

2192
01:29:54.211 --> 01:29:56.550
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what kind of deals they have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what the lakes.</v>

2193
01:29:56.670 --> 01:29:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2194
01:29:57.961 --> 01:29:58.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

2195
01:29:58.530 --> 01:30:03.530
<v Speaker 2>He might know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows now there's no wiki leaks and </v>

2196
01:30:03.530 --> 01:30:03.530
<v Speaker 2>69.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have said it though.</v>

2197
01:30:03.530 --> 01:30:03.530
<v Speaker 2>He knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2198
01:30:03.630 --> 01:30:05.200
<v Speaker 2>He would have liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the first thing.</v>

2199
01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Why would that be in wikileaks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2200
01:30:07.561 --> 01:30:09.810
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck needs to know if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually faked the moon landing?</v>

2201
01:30:09.811 --> 01:30:12.300
<v Speaker 2>So who needs to know a few people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2202
01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:13.750
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2203
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:18.950
<v Speaker 2>everyone in the space station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the fuck is the guy that made a </v>

2204
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:20.220
<v Speaker 2>2001 a space odyssey?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2205
01:30:20.221 --> 01:30:25.221
<v Speaker 2>I'm Kubrick Stanley Kubrick Kubrick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the number one conspiratory </v>

2206
01:30:25.221 --> 01:30:30.020
<v Speaker 2>speculate of a guy that they said that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kubrick was probably in on it and that </v>

2207
01:30:30.211 --> 01:30:31.170
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2208
01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of,</v>

2209
01:30:32.281 --> 01:30:33.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had uh,</v>

2210
01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:38.040
<v Speaker 2>a relationship with NASA and NASA came </v>
<v Speaker 2>to him for some things and he borrowed </v>

2211
01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.990
<v Speaker 2>the cameras from it or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2212
01:30:39.991 --> 01:30:40.710
<v Speaker 2>if I remember.</v>

2213
01:30:41.690 --> 01:30:44.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a total retard argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand folks.</v>

2214
01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:49.280
<v Speaker 2>And if you're here listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll fucking Rogan minimum on follow </v>

2215
01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:50.070
<v Speaker 2>on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No longer fair.</v>

2216
01:30:50.090 --> 01:30:53.040
<v Speaker 2>And we were there and I was a proud </v>
<v Speaker 2>American.</v>

2217
01:30:53.250 --> 01:30:55.900
<v Speaker 2>First of all is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know nothing.</v>

2218
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Nothing to do with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is us in,</v>

2219
01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:01.110
<v Speaker 2>in 1969 is not you dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

2220
01:31:01.111 --> 01:31:04.500
<v Speaker 2>those different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I maybe we did go.</v>

2221
01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:09.560
<v Speaker 2>It's very possible that we did go or </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very possible that the whole thing </v>

2222
01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:09.560
<v Speaker 2>was a fucking hoax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we went,</v>

2223
01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.610
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be shocked,</v>

2224
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:16.790
<v Speaker 2>but I've talked to people that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>truly believed that we went and it </v>

2225
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:17.700
<v Speaker 2>sounds to me a lot like religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not really into.</v>

2226
01:31:17.850 --> 01:31:21.030
<v Speaker 2>They're not willing to question it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That keeps saying what are the odds?</v>

2227
01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:23.940
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to fake this look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They faked a lot of shit.</v>

2228
01:31:24.090 --> 01:31:27.150
<v Speaker 2>They faked the Gulf of Tonkin incident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that goddess in the Vietnam War.</v>

2229
01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:28.950
<v Speaker 2>They were going to fake operation </v>
<v Speaker 2>northwoods.</v>

2230
01:31:28.951 --> 01:31:33.951
<v Speaker 2>You're going to blow up civilian </v>
<v Speaker 2>airliners and blame it on the Cubans to </v>

2231
01:31:33.951 --> 01:31:33.951
<v Speaker 2>get us to go to war with Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna arm,</v>

2232
01:31:33.951 --> 01:31:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Cuban friendlies and attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wanted them obey.</v>

2233
01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:39.040
<v Speaker 2>This is all shit that was not Alex </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jones.</v>

2234
01:31:39.041 --> 01:31:41.250
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black helicopters.</v>

2235
01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.110
<v Speaker 2>This is real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not.</v>

2236
01:31:43.111 --> 01:31:44.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>

2237
01:31:44.551 --> 01:31:47.430
<v Speaker 2>This is all freedom of information stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's a quote,</v>

2238
01:31:47.431 --> 01:31:52.431
<v Speaker 2>and this is the last thing I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say on it because this is right out of </v>

2239
01:31:52.431 --> 01:31:55.161
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton's book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton wrote this just a month </v>

2240
01:31:55.161 --> 01:31:59.511
<v Speaker 2>before apollo 11 astronauts buzz Aldrin </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Neil Armstrong had left their </v>

2241
01:31:59.511 --> 01:31:59.530
<v Speaker 2>colleague,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Collins,</v>

2242
01:31:59.531 --> 01:32:01.210
<v Speaker 2>a board spaceship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbia,</v>

2243
01:32:01.211 --> 01:32:03.850
<v Speaker 2>and walked on the moon beating by five </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

2244
01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:08.940
<v Speaker 2>President Kennedy's goal of putting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>man on the moon before the decade was </v>

2245
01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:11.911
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The old carpenter asked me if I really </v>

2246
01:32:11.911 --> 01:32:11.911
<v Speaker 2>believed that happened.</v>

2247
01:32:11.911 --> 01:32:11.911
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2248
01:32:11.911 --> 01:32:13.630
<v Speaker 2>I saw it on television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He disagreed.</v>

2249
01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:18.780
<v Speaker 2>He said that he didn't believe it for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute that them television fellers </v>

2250
01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:20.290
<v Speaker 2>could make things look real that weren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>back then.</v>

2251
01:32:20.291 --> 01:32:23.860
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was a crank during my eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>years in Washington.</v>

2252
01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:27.850
<v Speaker 2>I saw some things on tv that made me </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder if he wasn't ahead of his time,</v>

2253
01:32:28.570 --> 01:32:31.630
<v Speaker 2>that's bill fucking Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton,</v>

2254
01:32:31.631 --> 01:32:33.430
<v Speaker 2>but what does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it make me nothing?</v>

2255
01:32:33.431 --> 01:32:36.790
<v Speaker 2>It might mean that he's just saying that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are full of Shit you say,</v>

2256
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:39.550
<v Speaker 2>or it might mean that he just questioned</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moon landing.</v>

2257
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:42.820
<v Speaker 2>He just said that that guy might have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been ahead of his time.</v>

2258
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.620
<v Speaker 2>It is quite possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2259
01:32:44.621 --> 01:32:49.621
<v Speaker 2>if you were the president and you found </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people really didn't go to the </v>

2260
01:32:49.621 --> 01:32:49.621
<v Speaker 2>moon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

2261
01:32:49.621 --> 01:32:50.320
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just come out and say that,</v>

2262
01:32:50.321 --> 01:32:55.321
<v Speaker 2>and this is about as as transparent as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get by saying that we didn't go </v>

2263
01:32:55.541 --> 01:32:57.910
<v Speaker 2>to the moon and putting it into love to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask them about that quote,</v>

2264
01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.200
<v Speaker 2>that Shit.</v>

2265
01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:00.130
<v Speaker 2>He would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are you?</v>

2266
01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:05.140
<v Speaker 2>No one will ever ask him about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody needs to just ask them about </v>

2267
01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:05.200
<v Speaker 2>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's ever going to get that chance?</v>

2268
01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:08.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure a lot of people now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably hanging out.</v>

2269
01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:10.960
<v Speaker 2>He's probably got a twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This get asked those questions.</v>

2270
01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:16.310
<v Speaker 2>The most likely scenario is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moon landings were real and that people </v>

2271
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:17.950
<v Speaker 2>look for conspiracy and everything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look close enough at anything,</v>

2272
01:33:17.951 --> 01:33:19.930
<v Speaker 2>you can start to convince yourself that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a hoax.</v>

2273
01:33:20.110 --> 01:33:25.110
<v Speaker 2>That is absolutely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also possible they faked the whole </v>

2274
01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:29.221
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is possible that they murdered Gus </v>

2275
01:33:29.221 --> 01:33:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Grissom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the guy that was a fucking </v>

2276
01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:33.391
<v Speaker 2>astronaut and the Apollo one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the guy that died in the </v>

2277
01:33:33.391 --> 01:33:35.881
<v Speaker 2>simulator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burned to death with two other people </v>

2278
01:33:35.881 --> 01:33:37.561
<v Speaker 2>like I was questioning whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be able to get to it </v>

2279
01:33:37.561 --> 01:33:37.561
<v Speaker 2>left and right.</v>

2280
01:33:37.561 --> 01:33:40.770
<v Speaker 2>He actually hung a lemon on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>simulator and when he was doing </v>

2281
01:33:40.770 --> 01:33:41.530
<v Speaker 2>interviews with reporters to tell people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is a lemon and this is.</v>

2282
01:33:41.531 --> 01:33:44.050
<v Speaker 2>They can't even communicate with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking tower that's a,</v>

2283
01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:46.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a half a mile away.</v>

2284
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:51.270
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck are we going to talk to </v>

2285
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.270
<v Speaker 2>people when we're on the moon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two hundred 60,000</v>

2286
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.270
<v Speaker 2>miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy died.</v>

2287
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his family to this day,</v>

2288
01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:54.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's just his son,</v>

2289
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:59.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mrs his daddy and believes in </v>

2290
01:33:59.400 --> 01:33:59.400
<v Speaker 2>conspiracies to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they believe that NASA murdered him.</v>

2291
01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:02.140
<v Speaker 2>There was also a guy and his name was </v>
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Thomas,</v>

2292
01:34:02.141 --> 01:34:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Ronald Baron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was hired by Congress.</v>

2293
01:34:04.210 --> 01:34:07.270
<v Speaker 2>He was a safety inspector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was hired by Congress to oversee NASA</v>

2294
01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:10.420
<v Speaker 2>and look at the whole moon landing thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and z.</v>

2295
01:34:10.421 --> 01:34:11.620
<v Speaker 2>whether or not it's feasible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2296
01:34:11.621 --> 01:34:16.621
<v Speaker 2>this guy put together this 500 page </v>
<v Speaker 2>report and he questioned whether or not </v>

2297
01:34:16.621 --> 01:34:16.990
<v Speaker 2>they were ever going to get to the moon.</v>

2298
01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:21.990
<v Speaker 2>He said NASA was in such complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>disarray that he didn't think there was </v>

2299
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:23.230
<v Speaker 2>ever gonna be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy died a couple,</v>

2300
01:34:23.231 --> 01:34:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember how long afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very close afterwards in his car,</v>

2301
01:34:26.651 --> 01:34:29.000
<v Speaker 2>parked on a train track with his whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

2302
01:34:29.010 --> 01:34:32.920
<v Speaker 2>He parked his car and a train track and </v>
<v Speaker 2>died when the train hit the car.</v>

2303
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2304
01:34:33.730 --> 01:34:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Which is by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they got rid of people in 1969 folks</v>

2305
01:34:37.770 --> 01:34:39.460
<v Speaker 2>killed Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can kill you too,</v>

2306
01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:44.640
<v Speaker 2>and if you think you're going to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>around undermining NASA is fake mission </v>

2307
01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:44.640
<v Speaker 2>to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well guess what?</v>

2308
01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:49.261
<v Speaker 2>We're going to park your car on a train </v>
<v Speaker 2>track and you know you're going to </v>

2309
01:34:49.261 --> 01:34:49.261
<v Speaker 2>disappear and so is your little report </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Oh look,</v>

2310
01:34:49.261 --> 01:34:50.380
<v Speaker 2>we're on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

2311
01:34:50.850 --> 01:34:52.960
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows?</v>

2312
01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of us do.</v>

2313
01:34:54.670 --> 01:34:59.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly not claiming to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possessor of some truth and all I'm </v>

2314
01:34:59.670 --> 01:35:02.150
<v Speaker 2>saying is it is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could have pulled it off.</v>

2315
01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:05.540
<v Speaker 2>I firmly believed that with the insane </v>
<v Speaker 2>budget they had operating,</v>

2316
01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:08.150
<v Speaker 2>they could have pulled off almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything short of faking Godzilla.</v>

2317
01:35:08.151 --> 01:35:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Getting a attacking Tokes you see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie wag the dog?</v>

2318
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:12.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2319
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:15.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just came up with on the fly.</v>

2320
01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:20.560
<v Speaker 2>It was like with on the fly how </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hoffman's character just was like all </v>

2321
01:35:20.910 --> 01:35:25.910
<v Speaker 2>and then we'll do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll bring in this guy and then will </v>

2322
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.910
<v Speaker 2>cast this guy and that's a brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 2>move.</v>

2323
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:27.350
<v Speaker 2>That was a really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is what they could do.</v>

2324
01:35:27.370 --> 01:35:29.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look who the fuck knows?</v>

2325
01:35:29.241 --> 01:35:30.230
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a retard.</v>

2326
01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.330
<v Speaker 2>I am not married to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God I'm not.</v>

2327
01:35:32.331 --> 01:35:34.940
<v Speaker 2>I had two arguments on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the air,</v>

2328
01:35:34.941 --> 01:35:39.941
<v Speaker 2>on the Penn and teller show and Penn </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jillette rather pendulums radio show </v>

2329
01:35:39.941 --> 01:35:39.941
<v Speaker 2>with this Guy Phil plait.</v>

2330
01:35:39.941 --> 01:35:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Great Guy who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2331
01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:45.560
<v Speaker 2>an he runs bad astronomy.com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I debated him about it,</v>

2332
01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:50.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought he was going to clown me </v>

2333
01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:51.620
<v Speaker 2>and he kind of did in some ways in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first one because he was,</v>

2334
01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:56.640
<v Speaker 2>he kind of corrected me on some things </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe like really kind of see where </v>

2335
01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:59.951
<v Speaker 2>he was coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also he was not willing to look at </v>

2336
01:35:59.951 --> 01:36:02.861
<v Speaker 2>the possibility that was fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said you have to look at things from </v>

2337
01:36:02.861 --> 01:36:03.620
<v Speaker 2>both sides before you form a and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief in it.</v>

2338
01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:05.050
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>

2339
01:36:05.210 --> 01:36:08.000
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at it from both sides </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you choose what side you believe.</v>

2340
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:13.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's always going to believe in the </v>

2341
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:14.741
<v Speaker 2>side of science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a scientist and he's an astronomer </v>

2342
01:36:14.741 --> 01:36:16.991
<v Speaker 2>and it makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I was talking to him about </v>

2343
01:36:16.991 --> 01:36:16.991
<v Speaker 2>certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2344
01:36:16.991 --> 01:36:20.180
<v Speaker 2>one of them was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had some photos that they took the </v>

2345
01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:23.351
<v Speaker 2>clementine lunar orbiter and they took </v>
<v Speaker 2>these photos of the launch sites and </v>

2346
01:36:23.351 --> 01:36:26.900
<v Speaker 2>they had these little specks that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ground and they said that this is</v>

2347
01:36:26.901 --> 01:36:31.901
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like infrared photos from 330 </v>

2348
01:36:31.901 --> 01:36:31.901
<v Speaker 2>miles up or whatever.</v>

2349
01:36:31.901 --> 01:36:33.350
<v Speaker 2>The fuck it was 300 miles out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever those satellite is,</v>

2350
01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:38.410
<v Speaker 2>how far away it is from the moon and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these are photos and they showed </v>

2351
01:36:38.410 --> 01:36:41.801
<v Speaker 2>the landing site because it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>blast crater from when the thing took </v>

2352
01:36:41.801 --> 01:36:44.771
<v Speaker 2>off and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is that possible that you are </v>

2353
01:36:44.771 --> 01:36:49.091
<v Speaker 2>accepting that that is the photo of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>launch site when if you look at the </v>

2354
01:36:49.091 --> 01:36:50.900
<v Speaker 2>launch site and those high resolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>closeup photos,</v>

2355
01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:56.080
<v Speaker 2>there's no disturbance whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one of the things that like </v>

2356
01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:56.080
<v Speaker 2>all the posters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>

2357
01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:56.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that think it's a hoax,</v>

2358
01:36:56.570 --> 01:36:58.400
<v Speaker 2>that's what they always point to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this 10,000</v>

2359
01:36:58.401 --> 01:37:01.400
<v Speaker 2>pounds of thrust would have blasted a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking hole in the ground.</v>

2360
01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:03.260
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile when they landed there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

2361
01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:08.290
<v Speaker 2>It was totally undisturbed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how are you going to get crystal </v>

2362
01:37:08.290 --> 01:37:08.290
<v Speaker 2>clear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Close Up,</v>

2363
01:37:08.290 --> 01:37:09.140
<v Speaker 2>high resolution photos that show no </v>
<v Speaker 2>disturbance,</v>

2364
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:14.350
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be able to see it from </v>

2365
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.350
<v Speaker 2>orbit miles above the earth.</v>

2366
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:16.400
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna be able to see this little </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny dot from 300 miles up.</v>

2367
01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:19.940
<v Speaker 2>That's craziness and he didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything to say to that.</v>

2368
01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:21.620
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never considered that.</v>

2369
01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:23.480
<v Speaker 2>You never looked at these little craters</v>
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>

2370
01:37:23.481 --> 01:37:25.760
<v Speaker 2>how does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is that possible?</v>

2371
01:37:26.210 --> 01:37:30.260
<v Speaker 2>How many people are still around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That had been on the is quite a few.</v>

2372
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:31.460
<v Speaker 2>There's quite a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch,</v>

2373
01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:33.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are whole squirrely man.</v>

2374
01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:35.430
<v Speaker 2>Buzz Aldrin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2375
01:37:35.610 --> 01:37:40.610
<v Speaker 2>is this fascinating interviews with him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and his fascinating and one of them </v>

2376
01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:42.130
<v Speaker 2>where this guy who runs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got he,</v>

2377
01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:47.200
<v Speaker 2>he made the movie of a funny thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened on the way to the moon and he </v>

2378
01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:47.810
<v Speaker 2>told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tells buzz Aldrin he's a liar,</v>

2379
01:37:47.811 --> 01:37:49.480
<v Speaker 2>and Buzz Aldrin punches him in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh you.</v>

2380
01:37:49.490 --> 01:37:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rightly so.</v>

2381
01:37:51.411 --> 01:37:56.411
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if the guy did fucking fake the </v>

2382
01:37:56.411 --> 01:37:56.411
<v Speaker 2>moon landing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think his idea.</v>

2383
01:37:56.610 --> 01:37:58.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't think he got talked into doing</v>

2384
01:37:58.291 --> 01:37:59.610
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think that maybe they had some</v>

2385
01:37:59.611 --> 01:38:02.340
<v Speaker 2>fucking guns to his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they scared the shit out of him.</v>

2386
01:38:02.341 --> 01:38:05.340
<v Speaker 2>He became a massive alcoholic after he </v>
<v Speaker 2>came back from the moon landings.</v>

2387
01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:07.040
<v Speaker 2>One of the weirdest thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moon.</v>

2388
01:38:07.041 --> 01:38:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Then it says you have to watch the post </v>
<v Speaker 2>flight press conference.</v>

2389
01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:14.820
<v Speaker 2>I am no science expert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I am an expert in bullshit.</v>

2390
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:18.060
<v Speaker 2>I know when people are lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can fucking see it.</v>

2391
01:38:18.090 --> 01:38:19.740
<v Speaker 2>I can smell it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can too.</v>

2392
01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:24.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a weird thing with humans where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can tell when people are being </v>

2393
01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:26.700
<v Speaker 2>deceptive and these the video with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming back from the moon,</v>

2394
01:38:26.701 --> 01:38:28.500
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like they're full of shit.</v>

2395
01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:31.590
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like they're nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're definitely nervous too,</v>

2396
01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:33.420
<v Speaker 2>but it also seems like they're full of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2397
01:38:33.690 --> 01:38:36.270
<v Speaker 2>Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just shitty actors.</v>

2398
01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Was it a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it like an open press conference </v>

2399
01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:41.300
<v Speaker 2>where the core could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them,</v>

2400
01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:42.930
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They asked them what was it like?</v>

2401
01:38:42.931 --> 01:38:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Did you see any stars when you're on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moon?</v>

2402
01:38:44.231 --> 01:38:49.231
<v Speaker 2>And Michael Collins says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't recall seeing any stars when I </v>

2403
01:38:49.231 --> 01:38:49.231
<v Speaker 2>was on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't recall seeing it,</v>

2404
01:38:49.231 --> 01:38:53.160
<v Speaker 2>but meanwhile that's never left the </v>
<v Speaker 2>command module in the story.</v>

2405
01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:57.240
<v Speaker 2>The narrative is that Buzz Aldrin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Neil Armstrong made it to the moon,</v>

2406
01:38:57.241 --> 01:38:59.670
<v Speaker 2>but Michael Collins State in orbit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never went on the moon,</v>

2407
01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:04.290
<v Speaker 2>so they attributed that quote to buzz </v>
<v Speaker 2>Aldrin in the transcript because Michael</v>

2408
01:39:04.290 --> 01:39:05.550
<v Speaker 2>Collins would never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never say it.</v>

2409
01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:08.180
<v Speaker 2>It's it's all conspiratory talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2410
01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:08.820
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

2411
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.790
<v Speaker 2>but there's enough shit there that makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>me go.</v>

2412
01:39:11.791 --> 01:39:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not willing to totally buy this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it sounds ridiculous.</v>

2413
01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:18.690
<v Speaker 2>I know the arguments that the outcomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>razor man,</v>

2414
01:39:18.810 --> 01:39:23.810
<v Speaker 2>most likely scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go with that when the most </v>

2415
01:39:23.810 --> 01:39:24.810
<v Speaker 2>likely scenario is that we can't do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore because of budgetary reasons and</v>

2416
01:39:24.811 --> 01:39:29.811
<v Speaker 2>this and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's never been a single </v>

2417
01:39:29.811 --> 01:39:30.080
<v Speaker 2>technological achievement from 1969.</v>

2418
01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:35.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not cheaper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier or faster to reproduce today </v>

2419
01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:37.200
<v Speaker 2>except for putting people on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one is weird.</v>

2420
01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:42.440
<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time they talk about putting </v>

2421
01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:42.440
<v Speaker 2>people back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 20,</v>

2422
01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:42.440
<v Speaker 2>20 or 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>22,</v>

2423
01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.070
<v Speaker 2>but every president says they're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

2424
01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:46.290
<v Speaker 2>George Herbert Walker Bush that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do it.</v>

2425
01:39:46.291 --> 01:39:48.990
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton said he was going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Bush said he was going to.</v>

2426
01:39:48.991 --> 01:39:51.060
<v Speaker 2>They all talked about putting people </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the moon.</v>

2427
01:39:51.150 --> 01:39:53.580
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine Barack Obama?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd be like,</v>

2428
01:39:53.581 --> 01:39:56.580
<v Speaker 2>we have enough problems right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking here.</v>

2429
01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not the time to also do this.</v>

2430
01:39:59.310 --> 01:40:01.350
<v Speaker 2>It's also not the time to invade </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan,</v>

2431
01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:06.360
<v Speaker 2>so he can't be in Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a time to be concentrating on our </v>

2432
01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.410
<v Speaker 2>own economies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to that scary shit,</v>

2433
01:40:07.411 --> 01:40:08.880
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of it's scary</v>

2434
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:14.270
<v Speaker 3>San thing is because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you start with them then that cuts </v>

2435
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:18.050
<v Speaker 3>off all support to Afghanistan and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like now,</v>

2436
01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:19.050
<v Speaker 3>now it's game on on.</v>

2437
01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:23.800
<v Speaker 2>You want to fight three fucking pro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to have rewards at one time.</v>

2438
01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:25.620
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I ran his,</v>

2439
01:40:25.621 --> 01:40:27.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his comes into the picture too,</v>

2440
01:40:27.670 --> 01:40:29.460
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all this talk about evading.</v>

2441
01:40:29.461 --> 01:40:30.520
<v Speaker 2>I ran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if I ran,</v>

2442
01:40:30.521 --> 01:40:35.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps up its military program or its </v>

2443
01:40:35.521 --> 01:40:35.521
<v Speaker 2>nuclear program rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we have to invade Iran.</v>

2444
01:40:35.521 --> 01:40:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2445
01:40:36.010 --> 01:40:36.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2446
01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:41.690
<v Speaker 2>It's still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point about all this is that we don't</v>

2447
01:40:41.951 --> 01:40:46.951
<v Speaker 2>know what the fuck the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote running this world are </v>

2448
01:40:46.951 --> 01:40:48.940
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what they're doing.</v>

2449
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.720
<v Speaker 2>We assume that what they're telling us </v>
<v Speaker 2>is what's really going on,</v>

2450
01:40:52.930 --> 01:40:57.930
<v Speaker 2>but they've been proven over and over </v>
<v Speaker 2>again throughout history to be full of </v>

2451
01:40:57.930 --> 01:40:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Shit and they've even said they're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be full of shit to protect us.</v>

2452
01:40:59.230 --> 01:41:01.000
<v Speaker 2>They've said that the CIA has come out.</v>

2453
01:41:01.210 --> 01:41:06.210
<v Speaker 2>It was mainstream news reported that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were going to start making </v>

2454
01:41:06.210 --> 01:41:07.570
<v Speaker 2>artificial stories and putting them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the news to throw off the terrorists.</v>

2455
01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you start doing that,</v>

2456
01:41:09.311 --> 01:41:10.600
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all bets are off.</v>

2457
01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:15.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start lying to everybody to protect </v>

2458
01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:15.960
<v Speaker 2>us like Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the accountability?</v>

2459
01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Where at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When?</v>

2460
01:41:16.721 --> 01:41:18.180
<v Speaker 2>When does this stop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2461
01:41:18.190 --> 01:41:21.880
<v Speaker 2>why are we angry at the world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is the world angry at us?</v>

2462
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Why are we there yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it really have to be micromanaged?</v>

2463
01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:30.660
<v Speaker 2>Do we really have to manage all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the world and keep everybody </v>

2464
01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:31.120
<v Speaker 2>under our thumb?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you sure?</v>

2465
01:41:31.121 --> 01:41:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Is it just because we've been doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever?</v>

2466
01:41:33.250 --> 01:41:33.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2467
01:41:33.521 --> 01:41:35.950
<v Speaker 2>is there a better way to approach this?</v>

2468
01:41:36.570 --> 01:41:36.950
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2469
01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:44.020
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like right now with what is </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening here and the sentiment that </v>

2470
01:41:44.631 --> 01:41:48.140
<v Speaker 3>people feel about what's going on over </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Middle East and they're taking,</v>

2471
01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:50.060
<v Speaker 3>not that they're taken care of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>business on their own,</v>

2472
01:41:50.061 --> 01:41:54.390
<v Speaker 3>but you see things starting to play out </v>
<v Speaker 3>where even in Egypt it's like they're,</v>

2473
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:59.390
<v Speaker 3>they're handling the uprisings are </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening and if they're not perfect,</v>

2474
01:41:59.391 --> 01:42:04.391
<v Speaker 3>but things are getting sorted out on </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own and for us to be there </v>

2475
01:42:04.391 --> 01:42:06.140
<v Speaker 3>interfering or being the catalyst for </v>
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of things that happen is not</v>

2476
01:42:06.141 --> 01:42:08.400
<v Speaker 3>a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I have these uprisings,</v>

2477
01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:13.540
<v Speaker 3>you're knocking at the fucking Hornets </v>
<v Speaker 3>nest rather than just letting it be and </v>

2478
01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:16.040
<v Speaker 3>letting them take care of themselves or </v>
<v Speaker 3>take care of the situations that they're</v>

2479
01:42:16.041 --> 01:42:17.540
<v Speaker 3>not happy about themselves.</v>

2480
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what gets.</v>

2481
01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:23.680
<v Speaker 2>You got to kind of keep dictators from </v>
<v Speaker 2>rising up and just fucking up people </v>

2482
01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:24.740
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like because also when you get it,</v>

2483
01:42:24.770 --> 01:42:26.110
<v Speaker 3>but we don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't do,</v>

2484
01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:27.920
<v Speaker 3>we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do it when it's,</v>

2485
01:42:27.970 --> 01:42:30.590
<v Speaker 3>but when there are allies or there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends,</v>

2486
01:42:30.930 --> 01:42:32.120
<v Speaker 3>then we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's cool.</v>

2487
01:42:32.130 --> 01:42:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Then this is the guy that runs the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2488
01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.960
<v Speaker 3>I know there's problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's always been problems.</v>

2489
01:42:36.230 --> 01:42:37.160
<v Speaker 3>He's our friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

2490
01:42:37.190 --> 01:42:38.990
<v Speaker 3>he's not our friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking let's go.</v>

2491
01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:41.090
<v Speaker 3>Everyone in get them in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to get them out.</v>

2492
01:42:41.091 --> 01:42:42.740
<v Speaker 3>We got to get the next guy we can trust </v>
<v Speaker 3>in there.</v>

2493
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Egypt.</v>

2494
01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2495
01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:50.300
<v Speaker 3>He moved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moved and that's my fear about about </v>

2496
01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:50.300
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan now it's like we've been giving</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

2497
01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:55.240
<v Speaker 3>one and a half billion dollars a year </v>
<v Speaker 3>for arms and it's like now wait a </v>

2498
01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:55.240
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've,</v>

2499
01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:58.550
<v Speaker 3>you've had this guy for five fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2500
01:42:58.551 --> 01:43:03.551
<v Speaker 3>He's lived in this house five or 800 </v>
<v Speaker 3>yards away from a military base.</v>

2501
01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:09.140
<v Speaker 3>You gotta be fucking kidding me man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>

2509
01:43:22.490 --> 01:43:27.490
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another thing we were told about </v>

2510
01:43:27.490 --> 01:43:27.590
<v Speaker 3>like the dialysis thing and that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was almost an invalid,</v>

2511
01:43:27.591 --> 01:43:32.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like this guy was fucking </v>

2512
01:43:32.591 --> 01:43:34.580
<v Speaker 3>roaming around this house for five years</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nobody picked up on this.</v>

2513
01:43:34.670 --> 01:43:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very fantastic story.</v>

2514
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:42.070
<v Speaker 2>And we talked about this yesterday and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we said that if you had a movie and in </v>

2515
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:44.981
<v Speaker 2>the movie you wanted to have an ending </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it could leave room for the </v>

2516
01:43:44.981 --> 01:43:44.981
<v Speaker 2>sequel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the perfect ending.</v>

2517
01:43:44.981 --> 01:43:47.840
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to see the body as they </v>
<v Speaker 2>double and the ocean,</v>

2518
01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:49.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck van.</v>

2519
01:43:50.030 --> 01:43:50.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2520
01:43:50.910 --> 01:43:55.040
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like they want people to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they did have photos of him now,</v>

2521
01:43:55.041 --> 01:43:57.230
<v Speaker 2>let them fucking gas and keep things </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

2522
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Keeps things humming along and keeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2523
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:04.410
<v Speaker 3>Saddam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you showed him die.</v>

2524
01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.640
<v Speaker 3>They didn't just show you this video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't,</v>

2525
01:44:06.810 --> 01:44:11.810
<v Speaker 3>why can't we have a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They showed Rashawn Rondo's arm </v>

2526
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:13.980
<v Speaker 3>dislocated a thousand times on the news </v>
<v Speaker 3>that night and it was horrible.</v>

2527
01:44:13.981 --> 01:44:16.530
<v Speaker 3>Look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can see a fucking photo of,</v>

2528
01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:18.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like we fought this,</v>

2529
01:44:18.991 --> 01:44:23.991
<v Speaker 3>we've paid for this war for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had so much fucking problems </v>

2530
01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:25.020
<v Speaker 3>financially here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We send troops over there,</v>

2531
01:44:25.021 --> 01:44:28.180
<v Speaker 3>they've let us see the fucking photo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can see the arguments</v>

2532
01:44:28.350 --> 01:44:33.350
<v Speaker 2>not showing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see that it's going to make him </v>

2533
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.350
<v Speaker 2>a martyr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see that.</v>

2534
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.350
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna make people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2535
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:35.680
<v Speaker 2>in the militant movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic militant movement,</v>

2536
01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:38.140
<v Speaker 2>you know they're going to use that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>propaganda.</v>

2537
01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I can see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better to not show it when you're </v>

2538
01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:43.200
<v Speaker 2>dealing with religious fanatics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better to just.</v>

2539
01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.230
<v Speaker 2>If you really did have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2540
01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Jumping in the ocean or the upper gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>ice where everybody can be the next </v>

2541
01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:50.020
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come check it out.</v>

2542
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:53.070
<v Speaker 3>Not The high road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the high road.</v>

2543
01:44:53.071 --> 01:44:54.330
<v Speaker 3>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is the high road,</v>

2544
01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:55.760
<v Speaker 3>but I don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2545
01:44:55.810 --> 01:44:58.060
<v Speaker 2>We're even the high road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think it's the high road.</v>

2546
01:44:58.130 --> 01:44:59.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's the smart road.</v>

2547
01:44:59.890 --> 01:45:04.260
<v Speaker 2>I think if you look at as far as benefit</v>
<v Speaker 2>to to,</v>

2548
01:45:04.290 --> 01:45:06.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a negative repercussions,</v>

2549
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:12.030
<v Speaker 2>you would have to say that the benefit </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be would lie in not stirring up </v>

2550
01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:15.901
<v Speaker 2>more than possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've already killed the guy and </v>

2551
01:45:15.901 --> 01:45:15.901
<v Speaker 2>you've got the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2552
01:45:15.901 --> 01:45:17.140
<v Speaker 2>you did the work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did what the public wants you to do.</v>

2553
01:45:17.141 --> 01:45:19.480
<v Speaker 2>You got rid of public enemy number one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got rid of this guy.</v>

2554
01:45:19.481 --> 01:45:24.481
<v Speaker 2>He got his computers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that really happened the way they </v>

2555
01:45:24.481 --> 01:45:24.481
<v Speaker 2>said it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2556
01:45:24.481 --> 01:45:24.481
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2557
01:45:24.481 --> 01:45:24.600
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to show people the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures.</v>

2558
01:45:24.601 --> 01:45:25.040
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2559
01:45:25.041 --> 01:45:26.680
<v Speaker 2>you're protecting people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did your job.</v>

2560
01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:29.890
<v Speaker 2>If everybody is secure and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are important.</v>

2561
01:45:29.891 --> 01:45:31.280
<v Speaker 2>I've seen the photos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2562
01:45:31.281 --> 01:45:32.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't think we all need to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2563
01:45:32.631 --> 01:45:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it needs to be destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>

2564
01:45:34.361 --> 01:45:35.530
<v Speaker 2>What if they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds to me that.</v>

2565
01:45:35.531 --> 01:45:37.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say it's on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>website.</v>

2566
01:45:37.031 --> 01:45:38.110
<v Speaker 2>If you want to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

2567
01:45:38.111 --> 01:45:39.250
<v Speaker 2>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>

2568
01:45:39.251 --> 01:45:44.251
<v Speaker 2>That's not good because then the Islamic</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorists are gonna be able to look at </v>

2569
01:45:44.251 --> 01:45:47.071
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to look at it and they're </v>

2570
01:45:47.071 --> 01:45:48.270
<v Speaker 2>going to go fucking crazy and areas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>strap themselves up with it.</v>

2571
01:45:48.810 --> 01:45:53.780
<v Speaker 3>Domain Password.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't fucking get a hacker again.</v>

2572
01:45:54.050 --> 01:45:57.750
<v Speaker 3>It's password protected months or a year</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then a hacker's going to somehow</v>

2573
01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.570
<v Speaker 2>dot sal's computer that has it or do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something there.</v>

2574
01:46:00.571 --> 01:46:03.140
<v Speaker 2>There's gonna be a Wiki.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if this happened 10 years ago,</v>

2575
01:46:03.141 --> 01:46:06.590
<v Speaker 2>I would say definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think now I think probably not.</v>

2576
01:46:06.591 --> 01:46:11.591
<v Speaker 2>I think now they're probably pretty good</v>
<v Speaker 2>at stopping shit like that from </v>

2577
01:46:11.591 --> 01:46:11.591
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's all legit,</v>

2578
01:46:11.591 --> 01:46:13.880
<v Speaker 2>is it the Pentagon just hacked like </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple months ago.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2584
01:46:22.450 --> 01:46:24.530

<v Speaker 2>whatever because the reason why we're </v>

2588
01:46:35.010 --> 01:46:37.490
<v Speaker 2>there in certain places and he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in conspiracies,</v>

2589
01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:42.760
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at all the different </v>

<v Speaker 2>Lynch story.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And these are just the ones that have up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our faces.</v>

2594
01:46:50.011 --> 01:46:51.450
<v Speaker 2>How many of these have they got away </v>
<v Speaker 2>with?</v>

2595
01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:56.660
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many stories that we think are </v>

2596
01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:56.660
<v Speaker 2>history or just total complete horse </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:57.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot,</v>

2598

<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2600
01:47:00.810 --> 01:47:04.050
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be crazy to believe everything</v>

2601
01:47:04.051 --> 01:47:09.051
<v Speaker 2>they say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that you should believe </v>

2602
01:47:09.051 --> 01:47:09.051
<v Speaker 2>in conspiracy theories because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them are just as nuts.</v>

2603
01:47:09.051 --> 01:47:13.970
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the really naughty conspiracy </v>

2604
01:47:13.970 --> 01:47:14.160
<v Speaker 2>theories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Garol fucking t,</v>

2605
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:17.850
<v Speaker 2>those are put in place by the government</v>
<v Speaker 2>to discredit conspiracy theories.</v>

2606
01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:18.570
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2607
01:47:18.571 --> 01:47:21.240
<v Speaker 2>that's a tactic that's been used from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of time.</v>

2608
01:47:21.810 --> 01:47:26.810
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just information because she put </v>

2609
01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:29.960
<v Speaker 2>out disinformation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll give you a bunch of good </v>

2610
01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:29.960
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of things that make sense.</v>

2611
01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:33.700
<v Speaker 2>Like they'll say that Lee Harvey Oswald </v>
<v Speaker 2>did not act alone and you know,</v>

2612
01:47:33.810 --> 01:47:38.810
<v Speaker 2>he thought that he was doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had set him up and they really </v>

2613
01:47:38.810 --> 01:47:42.681
<v Speaker 2>shot Kennedy with assassins that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>set up in different parts of the grassy </v>

2614
01:47:42.681 --> 01:47:43.110
<v Speaker 2>knoll and all throughout Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>

2615
01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:48.260
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why they used Lee Harvey </v>
<v Speaker 2>Oswald's because they needed him to die </v>

2616
01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:52.040
<v Speaker 2>so that he could go through a wormhole </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Alpha Centauri to bring back the </v>

2617
01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:55.540
<v Speaker 2>master and the master is going to reach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All they have to do is that.</v>

2618
01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:59.150
<v Speaker 2>And then all sudden that'll all the Lee </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvey Oswald stuff is shit.</v>

2619
01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:03.180
<v Speaker 2>And now you're getting people like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't say Lee Harvey Oswald because then</v>

2620
01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:06.600
<v Speaker 2>you get to go to fucking sell somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Tom,</v>

2621
01:48:06.690 --> 01:48:10.140
<v Speaker 2>try talking about Ufos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried talking about aliens,</v>

2622
01:48:10.141 --> 01:48:12.210
<v Speaker 2>try talking about you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

2623
01:48:12.211 --> 01:48:16.170
<v Speaker 2>anything along those lines and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>automatically get labeled a Kook,</v>

2624
01:48:16.171 --> 01:48:18.510
<v Speaker 2>tried talking about big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking Kook.</v>

2625
01:48:18.810 --> 01:48:21.840
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile bigfoot might have very </v>
<v Speaker 2>well existed.</v>

2626
01:48:21.841 --> 01:48:23.820
<v Speaker 2>There's an animal called a gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>pythagoreous.</v>

2627
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.000
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking huge eight foot tall </v>
<v Speaker 2>erect ape that lived in Asia and might </v>

2628
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.660
<v Speaker 2>very well have come across the bering </v>
<v Speaker 2>strait.</v>

2629
01:48:30.810 --> 01:48:32.130
<v Speaker 2>Is it still alive now?</v>

2630
01:48:32.190 --> 01:48:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but might have existed at one point in </v>

2631
01:48:37.190 --> 01:48:37.190
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2632
01:48:37.190 --> 01:48:37.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a real animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2633
01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:42.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know what they think it might be </v>

2634
01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:44.630
<v Speaker 2>and it looks like big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it did exist and it existed just </v>

2635
01:48:44.630 --> 01:48:45.180
<v Speaker 2>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years or so ago.</v>

2636
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:47.610
<v Speaker 2>And there's been many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many instances of shit that they thought</v>

2637
01:48:47.611 --> 01:48:49.320
<v Speaker 2>was the long dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the Coelacanth.</v>

2638
01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:52.080
<v Speaker 2>There was a fish that's a god damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>prehistoric monster.</v>

2639
01:48:52.081 --> 01:48:54.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds of millions of years old.</v>

2640
01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:57.270
<v Speaker 2>They thought this thing was long extinct</v>
<v Speaker 2>until,</v>

2641
01:48:57.271 --> 01:49:00.540
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was in 1930.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone caught one and they're like,</v>

2642
01:49:00.541 --> 01:49:02.130
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are alive.</v>

2643
01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:03.930
<v Speaker 2>They're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're in the ocean.</v>

2644
01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:06.150
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows what's in the Pacific</v>
<v Speaker 2>northwest?</v>

2645
01:49:06.210 --> 01:49:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Fly over that shit in an airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2646
01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:13.560
<v Speaker 2>I was just up in Kirkland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington last weekend or two weekends </v>

2647
01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:13.560
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking crazy up there.</v>

2648
01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Dense forest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2649
01:49:15.150 --> 01:49:17.490
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about millions of acres.</v>

2650
01:49:17.490 --> 01:49:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Millions of square miles probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how many square and that's not </v>

2651
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:22.490
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thousands of square miles though.</v>

2652
01:49:22.590 --> 01:49:24.200
<v Speaker 2>What does this square miles a weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing like?</v>

2653
01:49:24.210 --> 01:49:25.530
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of footage in a square </v>
<v Speaker 2>mile.</v>

2654
01:49:25.531 --> 01:49:27.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not like the distance between two </v>
<v Speaker 2>points.</v>

2655
01:49:27.121 --> 01:49:32.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well how do you do it on a hill or </v>

2656
01:49:32.121 --> 01:49:32.121
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Millions of acres for sure,</v>

2657
01:49:32.121 --> 01:49:32.430
<v Speaker 2>but whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you fly over it,</v>

2658
01:49:32.431 --> 01:49:37.431
<v Speaker 2>you look at the density of the Pacific </v>
<v Speaker 2>northwest has legitimate rain forests </v>

2659
01:49:37.590 --> 01:49:42.590
<v Speaker 2>where you can't see inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what the fuck is in </v>

2660
01:49:42.590 --> 01:49:42.590
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of crazy shit in there.</v>

2661
01:49:42.590 --> 01:49:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Is there a big foot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>

2662
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't be surprised if it is.</v>

2663
01:49:47.230 --> 01:49:48.230
<v Speaker 2>If they've caught bigfoot</v>

2664
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:48.910
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2665
01:49:48.911 --> 01:49:50.720
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a big stupid monkey.</v>

2666
01:49:50.730 --> 01:49:53.170
<v Speaker 1>A who wouldn't be any different than an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orangutang.</v>

2667
01:49:53.171 --> 01:49:57.890
<v Speaker 1>It'd be cool if it had it dressed up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes.</v>

2668
01:49:57.920 --> 01:49:58.830
<v Speaker 1>If it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2669
01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:01.600
<v Speaker 1>you guys regulations had a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

2670
01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big was divorced.</v>

2671
01:50:04.290 --> 01:50:05.780
<v Speaker 1>He's got two kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't see,</v>

2672
01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:07.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't discover the mountain.</v>

2673
01:50:07.541 --> 01:50:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Gorilla and team till 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2674
01:50:09.101 --> 01:50:10.730
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2675
01:50:10.770 --> 01:50:15.770
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I discovered the mountain gorilla three </v>

2676
01:50:15.770 --> 01:50:16.760
<v Speaker 1>seconds ago with a giant ass fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge gorilla.</v>

2677
01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:19.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a big ass fucking gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm learned something.</v>

2678
01:50:19.770 --> 01:50:22.450
<v Speaker 1>My son loves dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's two and a half.</v>

2679
01:50:22.451 --> 01:50:25.930
<v Speaker 1>So we went to the Museum of natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>history in New York and just going like,</v>

2680
01:50:25.931 --> 01:50:27.700
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I haven't been to museums.</v>

2681
01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:28.780
<v Speaker 1>So I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

2682
01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:33.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like going back now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually care and you're learning </v>

2683
01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:33.800
<v Speaker 1>more like watching him and I are </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

2684
01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Like oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking like I looked at a t rex</v>

2685
01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:40.540
<v Speaker 1>is fucking massive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's massive.</v>

2686
01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vertebrae on the t rex is bigger </v>

2687
01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:46.570
<v Speaker 1>than my forearm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You crazy?</v>

2688
01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they try to figure out what the</v>

2689
01:50:49.091 --> 01:50:54.091
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the why the t rex was built like </v>

2690
01:50:54.091 --> 01:50:54.091
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much speculation.</v>

2691
01:50:54.091 --> 01:50:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Like why this thing of these giant legs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and these,</v>

2692
01:50:55.980 --> 01:51:00.980
<v Speaker 1>these little tiny arms and could it run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could they think even run like how fast </v>

2693
01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:02.650
<v Speaker 1>it gives you a little Jurassic Park they</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran,</v>

2694
01:51:03.010 --> 01:51:08.010
<v Speaker 1>they ran really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the speculation is that that's not </v>

2695
01:51:08.010 --> 01:51:11.011
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's other speculation by </v>

2696
01:51:11.011 --> 01:51:11.440
<v Speaker 1>more fringe people that think that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere was different than that.</v>

2697
01:51:11.441 --> 01:51:14.140
<v Speaker 1>It was a much denser atmosphere that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could carry your weight better.</v>

2698
01:51:14.170 --> 01:51:15.790
<v Speaker 1>The gravity was lighter or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2699
01:51:15.791 --> 01:51:17.220
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think they were unbelievable.</v>

2700
01:51:17.410 --> 01:51:22.410
<v Speaker 1>They never got off balance because their</v>
<v Speaker 1>tail wait almost as fresh as the front </v>

2701
01:51:22.410 --> 01:51:22.410
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>

2702
01:51:22.410 --> 01:51:24.010
<v Speaker 1>So they were never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could just lock those legs down and</v>

2703
01:51:24.011 --> 01:51:26.680
<v Speaker 1>just move around and that you can really</v>
<v Speaker 1>get them off balance.</v>

2704
01:51:26.710 --> 01:51:29.010
<v Speaker 1>There's also speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The t rex was just a,</v>

2705
01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:34.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a scavenger that those big teeth </v>

2706
01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:34.280
<v Speaker 1>were just for breaking up bones and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sheila.</v>

2707
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:39.310
<v Speaker 1>She was dying left and right all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the place and they would just find it </v>

2708
01:51:39.310 --> 01:51:39.800
<v Speaker 1>like a garbage disposal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just eat whatever you can.</v>

2709
01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Raptors would kill something and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

2710
01:51:41.861 --> 01:51:42.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would just go,</v>

2711
01:51:42.581 --> 01:51:43.270
<v Speaker 1>get out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

2712
01:51:43.271 --> 01:51:43.870
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mine,</v>

2713
01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:45.940
<v Speaker 1>and then they would be big and ugly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they,</v>

2714
01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:50.960
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's even speculation about their </v>

2715
01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:50.960
<v Speaker 1>coloring that they're coloring would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>very vulture,</v>

2716
01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:52.420
<v Speaker 1>like that's possible that they were like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hideous looking.</v>

2717
01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:56.740
<v Speaker 1>They would just giant garbage disposals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still fun to see like all the,</v>

2718
01:51:57.370 --> 01:52:00.850
<v Speaker 1>just the gigantic massive fucking bones </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had and stuff.</v>

2719
01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:02.560
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What people don't realize,</v>

2720
01:52:02.561 --> 01:52:07.561
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if this mean that world that </v>

2721
01:52:07.561 --> 01:52:07.561
<v Speaker 1>existed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2722
01:52:07.561 --> 01:52:12.450
<v Speaker 1>65 million years ago before that giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>meteor hit and killed all those </v>

2723
01:52:12.450 --> 01:52:15.451
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that world could easily be right now if </v>

2724
01:52:15.451 --> 01:52:15.451
<v Speaker 1>that made your didn't hit and there'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>no people,</v>

2725
01:52:15.451 --> 01:52:16.180
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There would be nothing.</v>

2726
01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Those things like what the world that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have now is one of several mass </v>

2727
01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:26.011
<v Speaker 1>extinction event worlds.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you were talking about going through a </v>

2845
01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:02.370
<v Speaker 3>period where you were on television and </v>
<v Speaker 3>still doing stand up and you felt old,</v>

2846
01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:08.000
<v Speaker 3>like your shit was getting old and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were getting tired of it and I've just </v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2863
01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:42.580
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do that nearly as much when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was younger and I appreciate my act and </v>

2864
01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:46.631
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate the process a lot more now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't take it for granted nearly </v>

2865
01:57:46.631 --> 01:57:46.631
<v Speaker 2>as much now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2866
01:57:46.631 --> 01:57:50.030
<v Speaker 2>before when my act was just completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>solid and it was,</v>

2867
01:57:50.031 --> 01:57:55.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I did for the next couple </v>

2868
01:57:55.031 --> 01:57:55.031
<v Speaker 2>of years and I really didn't add too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much to it.</v>

2869
01:57:55.190 --> 01:58:00.190
<v Speaker 2>There was a period in the nineties where</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did that where it just wasn't what </v>

2870
01:58:00.190 --> 01:58:01.670
<v Speaker 2>stanhope wasn't the same thing as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it is now,</v>

<v Speaker 2>now stand up.</v>

2872
01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:07.560

<v Speaker 2>constantly changing and evolving and I </v>
