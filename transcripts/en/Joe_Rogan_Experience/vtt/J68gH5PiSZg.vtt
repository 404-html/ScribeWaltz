1
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.950
<v Speaker 1>What's it called again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the gym called?</v>

2
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Verde Valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.840
<v Speaker 1>So Verde Valley Bjj and what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What town is that in?</v>

4
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Old Town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cottonwood and Arizona.</v>

5
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.260
<v Speaker 1>So you essentially like a invested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>built a gym out there,</v>

6
00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>so you'd have a place to train </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

7
00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's such a smart move.</v>

8
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of what you have to do,</v>

9
00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:25.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you'd have to drive hours to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mega tons down south.</v>

11
00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of places down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're just.</v>

12
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a two hour drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also Ted Osbourne.</v>

13
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>I was branches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jitsu has an academy there.</v>

14
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.270
<v Speaker 1>When you decide like where are you going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live?</v>

15
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.820
<v Speaker 1>When you decide where you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like decide to spend all your time,</v>

16
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>like do you ever go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing in the middle </v>

17
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>of nowhere in Arizona?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm maintaining peace of mind and I </v>

18
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.810
<v Speaker 1>remind myself of that right away.</v>

19
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>So that's like a central.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's planned out in the sense that just </v>

20
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.281
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isolation a little bit just to be </v>

21
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>able to unplug and reset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think just my introvert nature,</v>

22
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need that time.</v>

23
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.970
<v Speaker 1>I need that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need that introspection.</v>

24
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.560
<v Speaker 1>I need that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

25
00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>because of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are kind of an introvert,</v>

26
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.030
<v Speaker 1>but you're also kind of an extrovert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.460
<v Speaker 1>you're the lead singer of tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

28
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can only be so introverted </v>

29
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 1>and do what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to kind of fluctuated </v>

30
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 1>between Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I need to recharge.</v>

31
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.941
<v Speaker 1>I need to unplug and go back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>recharge and that I can go back out and </v>

32
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:30.160
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people never figured that out.</v>

33
00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just kind of burn.</v>

34
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>They burned the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd you figure out to not do that?</v>

35
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first couple of years of being in La,</v>

36
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.970
<v Speaker 1>realize it was just such an energy sap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed to actually literally go </v>

37
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.970
<v Speaker 1>someplace where there were very few </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

38
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the move,</v>

39
00:01:48.071 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

40
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.060
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always keep</v>

41
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.510
<v Speaker 1>thinking I should do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I go to some small town,</v>

42
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is probably the way to live.</v>

43
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Just like know the people around you </v>
<v Speaker 1>live around a few thousand people,</v>

44
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a grocery store that can backfire </v>

45
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

46
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Small town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small town,</v>

48
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.950
<v Speaker 1>big town drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ends up being the same thing,</v>

49
00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:11.650
<v Speaker 1>but you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a stranger yelling at you.</v>

50
00:02:11.651 --> 00:02:12.520
<v Speaker 1>It's your neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

51
00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:17.521
<v Speaker 1>I think the small town dramas better if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a college in town for some </v>

52
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:18.070
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

53
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Like those places like boulder or </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of cities like that.</v>

54
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Bozeman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana is a good example.</v>

55
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.250
<v Speaker 1>There's these places that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not big,</v>

56
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>but the university somehow another </v>
<v Speaker 1>balances out the intellectual vibe of </v>

57
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.820
<v Speaker 1>the town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see that.</v>

58
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like bolder.</v>

59
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

60
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Boulder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder</v>

61
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>what is like now in the height and fury </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Social Justice Warrior online </v>

62
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.350
<v Speaker 1>activism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if boulder has gotten weird.</v>

63
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been bashed because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>replaces kind of ramped up that shit </v>

64
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.010
<v Speaker 1>over the last few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get me okay.</v>

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Do your hands hurt when it gets cold?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Floyd had a bunch of hand </v>

121
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:09.300
<v Speaker 1>surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

122
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.100
<v Speaker 1>you got brittle hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hands hurt when it gets cold.</v>

123
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:15.170
<v Speaker 1>They hurt when it's cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

124
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.650
<v Speaker 1>I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

125
00:08:16.651 --> 00:08:20.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about boxing to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>any clue.</v>

126
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.980
<v Speaker 1>All I can look at it from a distance is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is floyd's older?</v>

127
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.830
<v Speaker 1>He's slightly smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's also the greatest defensive boxer </v>

128
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.910
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

129
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Like literally of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Michael Jordan was arguably one of </v>

130
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.050
<v Speaker 1>the best basketball player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but put him back in the game today.</v>

131
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.270
<v Speaker 1>You have a flood?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has it been now for that long?</v>

132
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:43.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's still relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's only been a couple of years.</v>

133
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it was two years since his last </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight against Andre Berto.</v>

134
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Was it two years and then before that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pack?</v>

135
00:08:49.431 --> 00:08:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fight,</v>

136
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

137
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.870
<v Speaker 1>he's not as crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

138
00:08:52.871 --> 00:08:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.650
<v Speaker 1>so that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was my look.</v>

140
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 5>That's what you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you and go age,</v>

141
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.930
<v Speaker 5>reach all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>size watching what happened to mcgregor </v>

142
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.680
<v Speaker 5>up against dss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having that wasn't really ready for that</v>

143
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.760
<v Speaker 5>larger dude to hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

144
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.090
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that the equation?</v>

145
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 5>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

146
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.680
<v Speaker 5>Mcgregor's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So He's,</v>

147
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:19.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he but Kenny handle a guy who's done </v>

148
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.950
<v Speaker 5>this a hundred times times.</v>

149
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.860
<v Speaker 3>He's done it more than 100 timing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Floyd's grew up doing it.</v>

150
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.620
<v Speaker 3>The thing about floyd is I think you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have an idea of what you can do to women</v>

151
00:09:26.621 --> 00:09:29.970
<v Speaker 3>until you get inside the ring with them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you realize how good he is.</v>

152
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 3>His defense is just on another level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just in a completely different zone</v>

153
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:35.760
<v Speaker 3>all by himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His movement,</v>

154
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.910
<v Speaker 3>the way he's able to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do with the way he </v>

155
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:41.520
<v Speaker 3>processes your movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throws it into his boxing computer.</v>

156
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:46.521
<v Speaker 3>And then before you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's catching you before you even </v>

157
00:09:46.521 --> 00:09:46.560
<v Speaker 3>know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just a wizard band when it comes to</v>

158
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:48.150
<v Speaker 3>boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is,</v>

159
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.540
<v Speaker 3>connor is a way bigger guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's younger.</v>

160
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.190
<v Speaker 3>He's way stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean physically stronger.</v>

161
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.510
<v Speaker 3>Not just in terms of like punching </v>
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>

162
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.810
<v Speaker 3>he's way stronger with punching power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's also like stronger physically.</v>

163
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.870
<v Speaker 3>Like if he gets a hold of floyd and </v>
<v Speaker 3>starts manipulating them.</v>

164
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:07.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm very curious to see what like his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his trainer John Kavanagh is a very,</v>

165
00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:12.351
<v Speaker 3>very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he's also worked with Paulie </v>

166
00:10:12.351 --> 00:10:15.710
<v Speaker 3>Malignaggi who's a world champion and </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the best boxing commentators in </v>

167
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.930
<v Speaker 3>the business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's helping connor.</v>

168
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:21.350
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know on paper you would have to say </v>

169
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.370
<v Speaker 3>floyd as a massive advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all this shit talking.</v>

170
00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Whereas on a man that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a different kind of shit.</v>

171
00:10:26.841 --> 00:10:29.160
<v Speaker 3>Talking to employees ever experienced </v>
<v Speaker 3>and had that.</v>

172
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.530
<v Speaker 3>He's got a guy telling him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can kill you easy.</v>

173
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.920
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a guy telling you that this is a </v>

174
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:36.920
<v Speaker 3>real fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're dead.</v>

175
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.170
<v Speaker 3>You're dead in 20 knows he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows he's right.</v>

176
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.600
<v Speaker 3>Floyd fucking knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Floyd,</v>

177
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.480
<v Speaker 3>he let his ego get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's have an MMA match.</v>

178
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.150
<v Speaker 3>Let's go ahead and have an MMA match </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he said.</v>

179
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.980
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a dead man.</v>

180
00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.430
<v Speaker 3>He's fighting them in the octagon there </v>
<v Speaker 3>and with four ounce gloves to.</v>

181
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:51.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that he's ridiculous.</v>

182
00:10:51.811 --> 00:10:56.811
<v Speaker 3>Let them use elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let them you just give them one more </v>

183
00:10:56.811 --> 00:10:59.841
<v Speaker 3>weapon and you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You tie up and you want to do this and </v>

184
00:10:59.841 --> 00:11:01.530
<v Speaker 3>over the top comes an elbow and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking legs give out on you.</v>

185
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.230
<v Speaker 3>One given one more weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give him knees.</v>

186
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.460
<v Speaker 3>Knees are leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't we.</v>

187
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I just think connor,</v>

188
00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:12.360
<v Speaker 3>I just think you need to calm down a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit and give him some beautiful.</v>

189
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.220
<v Speaker 3>Don't give him any space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just kidding.</v>

190
00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:17.190
<v Speaker 3>A little bit of space stuff showed up to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this little space.</v>

<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you filming?</v>

235
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.800
<v Speaker 1>You're filming a lot of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do it in four k?</v>

236
00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:01.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all the video stuff.</v>

237
00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:04.870
<v Speaker 1>We do a when that the one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that red camera first came out,</v>

238
00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:09.871
<v Speaker 1>we had some friends that were using math</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were using the Canon for </v>

239
00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:13.951
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just filming on and I don't know </v>

240
00:13:13.951 --> 00:13:17.010
<v Speaker 1>what they're filming on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just know that over the last five </v>

241
00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:22.711
<v Speaker 1>years just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just jump in technology for filming.</v>

242
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:28.320
<v Speaker 1>It's been amazing not having to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>like dude with like lights and some guy </v>

243
00:13:28.691 --> 00:13:29.920
<v Speaker 1>with a on a dolly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

244
00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:32.680
<v Speaker 1>it's like the guy's a small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny little thing.</v>

245
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Tiny thing doing insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane work.</v>

246
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.600
<v Speaker 1>They have trail cams now that are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>four k,</v>

247
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.120
<v Speaker 1>so like when they're looking for animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the woods,</v>

248
00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:45.121
<v Speaker 1>they put these cameras up on trails and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they capture motion capture and then </v>

249
00:13:45.121 --> 00:13:48.871
<v Speaker 1>they'd take video four k video and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking amazing low light video and they</v>

250
00:13:49.181 --> 00:13:49.850
<v Speaker 1>showed the difference.</v>

251
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:54.850
<v Speaker 1>There was something I was looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday and show the difference </v>

252
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.581
<v Speaker 1>between state of the art two years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus state of the art today and the </v>

253
00:13:56.581 --> 00:13:58.630
<v Speaker 1>exact same location,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exact same time and it's crazy.</v>

254
00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Like you could see everything crystal </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

255
00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:05.761
<v Speaker 1>It's hd video from a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little box tied to a tree and it looks</v>

256
00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:08.920
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty awesome.</v>

257
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're missing out on that hide out in </v>

258
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:14.130
<v Speaker 1>the middle of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arizona.</v>

259
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Not really though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

260
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not like when you're hiding out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

261
00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:18.580
<v Speaker 1>you're still connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

262
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:19.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

263
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.820
<v Speaker 1>We just finished our a two greenhouses </v>
<v Speaker 1>there were planting them this next week,</v>

264
00:14:24.821 --> 00:14:28.030
<v Speaker 1>so I've got full on greenhouses on one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the sites.</v>

265
00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Are you totally off the grid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not off the grid,</v>

266
00:14:30.341 --> 00:14:31.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean that would be,</v>

267
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.420
<v Speaker 1>that'd be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the goal.</v>

268
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Feel like you can be right with solar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

269
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've waited on solar just to see </v>

270
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:41.290
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canberra's were what they were two years</v>

271
00:14:41.291 --> 00:14:44.260
<v Speaker 1>ago to today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are the solar panels catching up?</v>

272
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Because I know that that technology is </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

273
00:14:46.781 --> 00:14:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know what Elon Musk is doing?</v>

274
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 1>He's making solar powered powered roof </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiles,</v>

275
00:14:52.041 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your whole roof is like a giant solar</v>

276
00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:55.820
<v Speaker 1>generator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

277
00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.210
<v Speaker 1>and those things are great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all you know,</v>

278
00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm the kind of guy that wakes up,</v>

279
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:00.380
<v Speaker 5>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to see.</v>

280
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:02.450
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once he's put those in place,</v>

281
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.280
<v Speaker 5>how do they do against tile?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A hail.</v>

282
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.010
<v Speaker 5>How did they do sun?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How.</v>

283
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:13.030
<v Speaker 5>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to see how those things last </v>

284
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.030
<v Speaker 5>because I'm not going to invest all that</v>
<v Speaker 5>money and,</v>

285
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.730
<v Speaker 5>and a roof tiles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If all of a sudden they find it a year </v>

286
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.080
<v Speaker 5>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that crack under Arizona Sunshine.</v>

287
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:22.860
<v Speaker 1>You get crazy storms in Arizona to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>near the place where they get typhoons.</v>

288
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it typhoons and monsoons?</v>

289
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Monsoons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

290
00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Science students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just started seeing evidence like </v>

291
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:31.110
<v Speaker 1>yesterday we got hailed and like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little dabble of monsoon yesterday.</v>

292
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes like people think of </v>

293
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing of the desert,</v>

294
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.770
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of different terrain </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Arizona.</v>

295
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

296
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:44.170
<v Speaker 1>And you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it rains you guys get fucking </v>

297
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:44.170
<v Speaker 1>pounded on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

298
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.070
<v Speaker 1>What is this gym?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hail test for the tesla roof tiles.</v>

299
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.000
<v Speaker 1>A lifetime warranty on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

300
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took it like a champ.</v>

301
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.700
<v Speaker 1>And what are those other two bitches?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

302
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.840
<v Speaker 1>the regular traditional roof tiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

303
00:15:57.841 --> 00:16:02.841
<v Speaker 1>they're regular roof tiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Tesla panels are fucking better </v>

304
00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:03.900
<v Speaker 1>bench 100 mile an hour impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

305
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Well then there you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>

306
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what I've been waiting </v>

307
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:11.530
<v Speaker 1>for it to see if they can get this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that technology up.</v>

308
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm just waiting for Elon Musk to run </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

309
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:13.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

310
00:16:13.651 --> 00:16:15.150
<v Speaker 1>you're on point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep it up.</v>

311
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just make roof tiles and cars and just </v>

312
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:20.170
<v Speaker 1>keep it up.</v>

313
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:20.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ben,</v>

314
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:25.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that being completely off </v>

315
00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.000
<v Speaker 5>the grid is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's an option for some people.</v>

316
00:16:27.001 --> 00:16:29.340
<v Speaker 5>There's just too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For you to be actually,</v>

317
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>completely unplug and be isolated.</v>

318
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be comedy ones.</v>

319
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Don't know it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was going to be trade.</v>

320
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.000
<v Speaker 1>He's turned into a big fuck fest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

321
00:16:40.001 --> 00:16:41.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like the one that you'd be like the</v>

322
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.580
<v Speaker 5>leader and you just want to bang and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's wife.</v>

323
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From experience that you're.</v>

324
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.370
<v Speaker 1>That you're aware of a let now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

325
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is what happens,</v>

326
00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:54.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see.</v>

327
00:16:54.501 --> 00:16:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I think that like off the grid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in terms of like non reliance,</v>

328
00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:03.460
<v Speaker 1>but connectivity in terms of like being </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to figure out what's going on in </v>

329
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:03.460
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

330
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

331
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.070
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

332
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:09.110
<v Speaker 5>that's a reasonable goal I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think even even being off the </v>

333
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:10.820
<v Speaker 5>grid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like,</v>

334
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:15.821
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can get to a certain point in </v>

335
00:17:15.821 --> 00:17:18.210
<v Speaker 5>today's society where you can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>unplugged from your,</v>

336
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:23.770
<v Speaker 5>your power and your water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but somebody's going to come for your </v>

337
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:23.770
<v Speaker 5>water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he's going to come for.</v>

338
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:28.040
<v Speaker 5>There's various places around the United</v>
<v Speaker 5>States where they come after you for </v>

339
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.070
<v Speaker 5>growing your own food on your land.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do they really?</v>

340
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:34.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's weird stuff everywhere like </v>

341
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.190
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

342
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200
<v Speaker 5>What kind of regulations or do they have</v>
<v Speaker 5>against?</v>

343
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.640
<v Speaker 5>It ended up using.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would probably justify it in terms </v>

344
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.640
<v Speaker 5>of your house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your House is zoned residential,</v>

345
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.350
<v Speaker 5>not Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not agriculture or you're,</v>

346
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.880
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not allowed to use the city water</v>

347
00:17:47.881 --> 00:17:49.920
<v Speaker 5>to water your garden.</v>

348
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:55.370
<v Speaker 6>I've actually heard this before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've heard people get in trouble with </v>

349
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:55.370
<v Speaker 6>that before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

350
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:59.010
<v Speaker 6>it's just another level of government </v>
<v Speaker 6>control.</v>

351
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.720
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just like,</v>

352
00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.060
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not,</v>

353
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.330
<v Speaker 6>you're not a prepper.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

354
00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.760
<v Speaker 6>I'm a prepper,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but slightly but not.</v>

355
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.780
<v Speaker 5>Not In that Alex Jones sort of way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

356
00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:11.370
<v Speaker 5>not that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not that bananas.</v>

357
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.400
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think just being prepared and </v>

358
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.621
<v Speaker 5>understanding that eventually the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there'll be an interruption and the </v>

359
00:18:18.621 --> 00:18:21.861
<v Speaker 5>water that comes to you and the food </v>
<v Speaker 5>that gets to just understanding how to </v>

360
00:18:21.861 --> 00:18:22.410
<v Speaker 5>grow food is not being a prepper.</v>

361
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.560
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's wise.</v>

362
00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.440
<v Speaker 6>It's like having a lot of boxes checked </v>
<v Speaker 6>off.</v>

363
00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.900
<v Speaker 6>We just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it also doesn't it feel good.</v>

364
00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.990
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm sure I know that you love your </v>
<v Speaker 6>wine.</v>

365
00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:37.020
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's got to feel good when you have a </v>

366
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.940
<v Speaker 6>glass of the wine that you've grown and </v>
<v Speaker 6>created and worked so hard on and it </v>

367
00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:44.460
<v Speaker 6>just established this perfect time of </v>
<v Speaker 6>keeping in the barrels and you know,</v>

368
00:18:45.431 --> 00:18:48.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure there's got to be like massive </v>
<v Speaker 6>satisfaction to that.</v>

369
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.060
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

370
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.680
<v Speaker 5>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it spirals out into all these other,</v>

371
00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.740
<v Speaker 5>other areas of understanding again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to,</v>

372
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.570
<v Speaker 5>how to grow your own food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You start,</v>

373
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:03.900
<v Speaker 5>you start talking to and communicating </v>
<v Speaker 5>with people that you wouldn't normally </v>

374
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.210
<v Speaker 5>talk to like Republican guys now talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the Liberal Democrat guy and the,</v>

375
00:19:07.211 --> 00:19:12.211
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this religion is talking to that </v>

376
00:19:12.211 --> 00:19:12.820
<v Speaker 5>religion and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's all these economic,</v>

377
00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:17.850
<v Speaker 5>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>political lines get blurred because in </v>

378
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:22.381
<v Speaker 5>that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about growing a thing and </v>

379
00:19:22.381 --> 00:19:24.090
<v Speaker 5>sustaining a local community,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of those things tend to go away.</v>

380
00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:29.130
<v Speaker 5>Just turn this thing off and get back to</v>
<v Speaker 5>understanding what it's going to take to</v>

381
00:19:31.631 --> 00:19:36.631
<v Speaker 5>make you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make these exchanges and do these </v>

382
00:19:36.631 --> 00:19:38.701
<v Speaker 5>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You start to really feel connected with </v>

383
00:19:38.701 --> 00:19:42.580
<v Speaker 5>people rather than this weird divisive </v>
<v Speaker 5>crap that goes on in the world.</v>

384
00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:48.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there's definitely like we need </v>

385
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.581
<v Speaker 6>to figure out how to spend more time </v>
<v Speaker 6>just having a regular normal day to day </v>

386
00:19:50.581 --> 00:19:54.661
<v Speaker 6>conversations because it seems to me </v>
<v Speaker 6>like people are worse at it than they </v>

387
00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:55.900
<v Speaker 6>ever been before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People interrupt people more than like,</v>

388
00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:00.990
<v Speaker 6>they're not good at like listening and </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking because I think people are so </v>

389
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.890
<v Speaker 6>accustomed to communicating with people </v>
<v Speaker 6>through devices.</v>

390
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:08.280
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like we're were rusty were </v>
<v Speaker 6>rusty on how we talk to people because </v>

391
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.901
<v Speaker 6>we don't do it that much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like how often do you call someone on </v>

392
00:20:12.901 --> 00:20:15.781
<v Speaker 6>the phone?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not that you and I have maybe never had </v>

393
00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:18.991
<v Speaker 6>a phone call.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe one phone conversations always </v>

394
00:20:18.991 --> 00:20:19.480
<v Speaker 6>text and kind of all my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If someone calls me up,</v>

395
00:20:19.481 --> 00:20:20.380
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's everything?</v>

396
00:20:20.381 --> 00:20:21.320
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

397
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:22.120
<v Speaker 6>Like what's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

398
00:20:22.121 --> 00:20:22.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

399
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:27.430
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't use that thing for talking to </v>

400
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.430
<v Speaker 5>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't use this.</v>

401
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:31.190
<v Speaker 5>Don't use this to talk to people because</v>
<v Speaker 5>the technology to me still isn't where </v>

402
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:35.981
<v Speaker 5>it should be because I'll be in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle of making a point with somebody </v>

403
00:20:35.981 --> 00:20:39.880
<v Speaker 5>and the phone call will drop and we have</v>
<v Speaker 5>to start over and so he got mad because </v>

404
00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:45.210
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why I usually text her email </v>

405
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.201
<v Speaker 5>because I can get the whole thought down</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then if we want to talk about </v>

406
00:20:47.201 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 5>summing up some details it I'll say I'll</v>
<v Speaker 5>call</v>

407
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.500
<v Speaker 1>you from landline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll actually call people from.</v>

408
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll find a landline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

409
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even have them anymore.</v>

410
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:59.260
<v Speaker 1>The red red around illegal right around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time as the cassette.</v>

411
00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I send a raven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I do.</v>

412
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I got some dope ravens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're super smart.</v>

413
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:10.860
<v Speaker 1>You just got to leave like pineapple in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the and that's what they like to go </v>

414
00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:10.870
<v Speaker 1>right to the pineapple take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a little message.</v>

415
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.080
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See this today.</v>

416
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus Christ</v>

417
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.080
<v Speaker 3>to scientists make teleportation </v>
<v Speaker 3>breakthrough,</v>

418
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:23.830
<v Speaker 3>but that's in the New York Post.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also did an article about how </v>

419
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.550
<v Speaker 3>Travis Browne and Ronda Rousey are </v>
<v Speaker 3>fading losers.</v>

420
00:21:25.551 --> 00:21:30.350
<v Speaker 3>Like it was the most ruthless article.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a great.</v>

421
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:35.470
<v Speaker 3>It's a great argument for not living in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a condensed population and some of the </v>

422
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.300
<v Speaker 3>articles in New York tabloid papers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're so fucking mean.</v>

423
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just something about like being in the,</v>

424
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.160
<v Speaker 3>like an island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Manhattan where.</v>

425
00:21:43.161 --> 00:21:48.161
<v Speaker 3>But he stopped in there where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>just get super shitty with each other </v>

426
00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:48.161
<v Speaker 3>and they find it okay to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

427
00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.820
<v Speaker 3>So what does this teleportation.</v>

428
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.160
<v Speaker 7>It's saying that it's teleporter to </v>
<v Speaker 7>photon from Earth to space,</v>

429
00:21:55.161 --> 00:21:57.680
<v Speaker 7>like 50 miles in this space.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not exactly what happened.</v>

430
00:21:57.681 --> 00:22:00.350
<v Speaker 7>They transported the information of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>Proton,</v>

431
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:05.830
<v Speaker 7>which is also,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's equally important because they can </v>

432
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.550
<v Speaker 7>send out a fax to somebody again.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Space.</v>

433
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.610
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

434
00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Mit saying it.</v>

435
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:17.340
<v Speaker 3>So in sending a Photon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that like one step to sending light?</v>

436
00:22:17.341 --> 00:22:17.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

437
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:21.550
<v Speaker 7>take the first step to say like it made </v>
<v Speaker 7>it like a carbon copy of it.</v>

438
00:22:21.551 --> 00:22:24.520
<v Speaker 7>It's virtually identical.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like an identical twin of it.</v>

439
00:22:24.521 --> 00:22:24.640
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

440
00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:25.400
<v Speaker 1>it could be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

441
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:30.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of newspapers are very </v>

442
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.411
<v Speaker 1>similar to what we're seeing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook as far as the immediate </v>

443
00:22:32.511 --> 00:22:37.511
<v Speaker 1>feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they adjust the article and </v>

444
00:22:37.511 --> 00:22:38.240
<v Speaker 1>adjust the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the headline to not only make money from</v>

445
00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:43.420
<v Speaker 1>clicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also to manipulate what you were </v>

446
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.331
<v Speaker 1>thinking about a particular subject so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can adjust your vote purchasing </v>

447
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.600
<v Speaker 1>patterns of those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know these click bait things.</v>

448
00:22:50.601 --> 00:22:55.601
<v Speaker 1>That could have been a word in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>title that they know people like you </v>

449
00:22:55.601 --> 00:22:58.511
<v Speaker 1>love to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they got you clicking on it even </v>

450
00:22:58.511 --> 00:22:58.511
<v Speaker 1>though there might be nothing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>article.</v>

451
00:22:58.511 --> 00:22:59.620
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

452
00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.860
<v Speaker 1>You see like purposely deceptive article</v>
<v Speaker 1>headings.</v>

453
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.170
<v Speaker 1>So they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rope you in and you're like,</v>

454
00:23:06.171 --> 00:23:07.700
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>

455
00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:11.000
<v Speaker 1>But even doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like are they talk well,</v>

456
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.470
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your original Photon,</v>

457
00:23:12.471 --> 00:23:15.850
<v Speaker 1>the original photon remains present in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the original location.</v>

458
00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:21.030
<v Speaker 7>It's a first step in some quantum </v>
<v Speaker 7>physics type deal proving that it can </v>

459
00:23:21.041 --> 00:23:26.041
<v Speaker 7>actually happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Versus like just being a theory as far </v>

460
00:23:26.041 --> 00:23:27.650
<v Speaker 7>as I understood.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I listened to a one minute video where I</v>

461
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.580
<v Speaker 7>talked to my buddy about this buy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are you buying any of this?</v>

462
00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:34.700
<v Speaker 3>Fuck all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck all them.</v>

463
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Anywhere in that dorm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One point you and your Fox on you and </v>

464
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.550
<v Speaker 3>your Proton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one foot in your fucking proton.</v>

465
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand what they're.</v>

466
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 3>So does that</v>

467
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.010
<v Speaker 5>mean like one day they'll have a jamie </v>
<v Speaker 5>vernon on a space holodeck in Arizona </v>

468
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:54.450
<v Speaker 5>and they'll zoom you up to space,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then you'll still be here.</v>

469
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:59.500
<v Speaker 7>It's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think that that's what they're </v>

470
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.001
<v Speaker 7>doing with it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think this means more like they can </v>

471
00:24:01.001 --> 00:24:02.981
<v Speaker 7>send the packets of information without </v>
<v Speaker 7>needing fiber or Wifi or anything like </v>

472
00:24:03.741 --> 00:24:06.230
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that's the first possible use of</v>

473
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:06.410
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

474
00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a matter of time before we </v>
<v Speaker 5>start duplicating things that we </v>

475
00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't be duplicating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

476
00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:16.431
<v Speaker 5>like a whole human beings like how many </v>
<v Speaker 5>deranged monarchs are going to get a </v>

477
00:24:18.071 --> 00:24:23.071
<v Speaker 5>hold of this like way before anybody </v>
<v Speaker 5>else is trillionaire dudes and they're </v>

478
00:24:23.071 --> 00:24:27.200
<v Speaker 5>gonna spend a shit ton of money to have </v>
<v Speaker 5>copies of them and just make a bunch of </v>

479
00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:32.940
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if it's just a heath ledger's the </v>

480
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.050
<v Speaker 5>joker who is actually putting this out </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's figured out a way to get all of</v>

481
00:24:34.051 --> 00:24:36.900
<v Speaker 5>those beginner people to jump on this </v>
<v Speaker 5>spaceship.</v>

482
00:24:36.901 --> 00:24:41.130
<v Speaker 5>That goes nowhere and he's giggling </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere.</v>

483
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.200
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always say we feel like we were always</v>

484
00:24:43.201 --> 00:24:46.710
<v Speaker 5>one invention that we don't see coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>away from ruining everything.</v>

485
00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

486
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.840
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could be,</v>

487
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.150
<v Speaker 5>it could be exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This kind of thing.</v>

488
00:24:51.151 --> 00:24:53.130
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this algorithmic.</v>

489
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:58.400
<v Speaker 5>You going down a rabbit hole in this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a narcissistic feedback on what you want</v>

490
00:24:58.461 --> 00:25:00.720
<v Speaker 5>to see and then it tells,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tells you what you want to hear and then</v>

491
00:25:00.721 --> 00:25:02.010
<v Speaker 5>it gets you to buy what you want to buy.</v>

492
00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:05.460
<v Speaker 5>But like the thing you want to buy might</v>
<v Speaker 5>be this rabbit hole of,</v>

493
00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.160
<v Speaker 5>of leveling the playing field for </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>

494
00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might be wants.</v>

495
00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.310
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

496
00:25:11.311 --> 00:25:13.190
<v Speaker 5>I think the only.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

497
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:14.860
<v Speaker 5>Is there a way out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

498
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:16.920
<v Speaker 5>doesn't seem like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

499
00:25:16.921 --> 00:25:21.921
<v Speaker 5>I think the other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way out of it is his understanding </v>

500
00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:27.410
<v Speaker 5>that the things you're being told here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this has nothing to do with mastership,</v>

501
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.240
<v Speaker 5>if that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The phone,</v>

502
00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:36.050
<v Speaker 5>just media things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're reading on your social media </v>

503
00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:36.050
<v Speaker 5>pages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This has nothing to do with a guy.</v>

504
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:39.380
<v Speaker 5>I read all those articles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's not necessarily mastership.</v>

505
00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.340
<v Speaker 5>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to a master who has,</v>

506
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:46.540
<v Speaker 5>who has spent all this time doing a </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing or researching a thing and </v>

507
00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:47.940
<v Speaker 5>master's degree in a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you go to this class,</v>

508
00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:51.990
<v Speaker 5>you take the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the effort it takes to get to that place</v>

509
00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:57.290
<v Speaker 5>at every step along the way is a new </v>
<v Speaker 5>level of revelation or some kind of </v>

510
00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:58.710
<v Speaker 5>epiphany of understanding of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

511
00:25:58.711 --> 00:26:03.711
<v Speaker 5>that's why we did this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then now I can understand that and </v>

512
00:26:03.711 --> 00:26:04.590
<v Speaker 5>educate yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so destroying,</v>

513
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:10.110
<v Speaker 5>destroying an entire base of ignorance </v>
<v Speaker 5>and knee jerk reaction,</v>

514
00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.810
<v Speaker 5>clicking on links and being fed </v>
<v Speaker 5>horseshit.</v>

515
00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:17.280
<v Speaker 5>It almost has to be like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a conscious effort on each individual to</v>

516
00:26:17.281 --> 00:26:21.810
<v Speaker 5>step back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate that trump supporter.</v>

517
00:26:21.811 --> 00:26:26.811
<v Speaker 5>I hate that hillary or a Bernie </v>
<v Speaker 5>supporter because of the things I've </v>

518
00:26:26.811 --> 00:26:28.680
<v Speaker 5>been told and the things I believe that </v>
<v Speaker 5>had been fed back to me.</v>

519
00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.020
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if,</v>

520
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.200
<v Speaker 5>then this is the hardest step,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think for most people.</v>

521
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:38.130
<v Speaker 5>What if I am completely wrong about all </v>
<v Speaker 5>of it?</v>

522
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.390
<v Speaker 5>So how do I empty my vessel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>opened my mind,</v>

523
00:26:42.391 --> 00:26:45.180
<v Speaker 5>and try to figure backtrack on what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>truth is?</v>

524
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.220
<v Speaker 5>Is this person really that much </v>
<v Speaker 5>different than me?</v>

525
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:52.640
<v Speaker 5>Are these people that much different?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did they grow up with a bad you bad set </v>

526
00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.770
<v Speaker 5>of poison in their system that I grew up</v>
<v Speaker 5>with a bad poison in my system?</v>

527
00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:01.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know if there's any way out </v>

528
00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.411
<v Speaker 5>of it because the solution I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about requires a lot of introspection,</v>

529
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.380
<v Speaker 5>a self evaluation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of,</v>

530
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:13.100
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being more open than most people are </v>

531
00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:13.100
<v Speaker 5>willing to be.</v>

532
00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.830
<v Speaker 6>Do you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there's a way out of it because </v>

533
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.661
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of people like you saying </v>
<v Speaker 6>that I know a lot of people that are </v>

534
00:27:18.661 --> 00:27:21.481
<v Speaker 6>saying that now and it seems like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>message that's being broadcast by a </v>

535
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:25.801
<v Speaker 6>bunch of people that have gone through </v>
<v Speaker 6>the gauntlet of life and had a bunch of </v>

536
00:27:25.801 --> 00:27:30.481
<v Speaker 6>trials and tribulations and they reached</v>
<v Speaker 6>this point where they kind of have an </v>

537
00:27:30.481 --> 00:27:32.140
<v Speaker 6>understanding of what it's taken them to</v>
<v Speaker 6>get there.</v>

538
00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:37.560
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of people like you have this </v>
<v Speaker 6>desire to relay this information and </v>

539
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.490
<v Speaker 6>people are listening and there's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 6>of other people that are saying the same</v>

540
00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:43.150
<v Speaker 6>thing that have also gone through their </v>
<v Speaker 6>own separate trials and I think it's a,</v>

541
00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.940
<v Speaker 6>it's a more prevalent message than I've </v>
<v Speaker 6>ever heard in my life.</v>

542
00:27:45.941 --> 00:27:49.420
<v Speaker 6>And I'm almost 50.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll be 50 next month and I feel like in</v>

543
00:27:49.421 --> 00:27:50.500
<v Speaker 6>my life I've never.</v>

544
00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.310
<v Speaker 6>August 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

545
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.520
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's your birthday is a 12.</v>

546
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.980
<v Speaker 6>Get the fuck Outta here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bitch.</v>

547
00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:57.760
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

548
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.900
<v Speaker 6>my son's birthday's the fifth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My wine making buddies is the eighth </v>

549
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:07.170
<v Speaker 6>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went in and out of the army the first </v>

550
00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.361
<v Speaker 6>week of August.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're basically all in the same </v>

551
00:28:09.361 --> 00:28:09.361
<v Speaker 6>fraternity basically,</v>
<v Speaker 6>except for me.</v>

552
00:28:09.361 --> 00:28:10.120
<v Speaker 6>I'm on areas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's a girl's thing?</v>

553
00:28:10.121 --> 00:28:11.590
<v Speaker 6>It's not a fraternity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is it called?</v>

554
00:28:11.591 --> 00:28:12.340
<v Speaker 6>Sorority.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

555
00:28:12.341 --> 00:28:14.250
<v Speaker 6>We're in the same sorority.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

556
00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.240
<v Speaker 6>Was the same month.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are you going?</v>

557
00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.780
<v Speaker 6>Just the new ge?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

558
00:28:19.781 --> 00:28:21.010
<v Speaker 6>I think more people are talking about </v>
<v Speaker 6>though,</v>

559
00:28:21.011 --> 00:28:23.020
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's going to be not going to be</v>

560
00:28:23.021 --> 00:28:25.120
<v Speaker 6>for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think there's way more people that</v>

561
00:28:25.121 --> 00:28:28.870
<v Speaker 6>are trying to do better with their life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do better with their mind,</v>

562
00:28:28.871 --> 00:28:30.230
<v Speaker 6>do better with themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

563
00:28:30.231 --> 00:28:31.870
<v Speaker 6>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very common thing.</v>

564
00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.960
<v Speaker 6>So much so there's a lot of criticisms </v>
<v Speaker 6>about the various methods and people </v>

565
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.880
<v Speaker 6>kind of losing sight and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

566
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:42.900
<v Speaker 6>there's a bunch of bullshit artists that</v>
<v Speaker 6>are capitalizing on this idea as well </v>

567
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.711
<v Speaker 6>and they're not really doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're pretending they're doing it </v>

568
00:28:46.711 --> 00:28:46.840
<v Speaker 6>and they're talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're not really an action.</v>

569
00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.630
<v Speaker 6>But you can kind of see those guys </v>
<v Speaker 6>always look a little doughy.</v>

570
00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.100
<v Speaker 6>They always look a little,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

571
00:28:51.101 --> 00:28:56.101
<v Speaker 6>they're not really doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're talking about people love </v>

572
00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:59.911
<v Speaker 6>talking about shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't really do like some of my </v>

573
00:28:59.911 --> 00:28:59.911
<v Speaker 6>friends that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

574
00:28:59.911 --> 00:29:02.080
<v Speaker 6>they'll talk about writing comedy way </v>
<v Speaker 6>more than they actually write comedy.</v>

575
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.520
<v Speaker 6>Like Judd apatow said that he said like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't fucking talk about writing just </v>

576
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.230
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he's right.</v>

577
00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.740
<v Speaker 6>Nice one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

578
00:29:11.741 --> 00:29:12.850
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>isn't it the same thing?</v>

579
00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:16.540
<v Speaker 6>It's like there's a fine line between </v>
<v Speaker 6>inspiring,</v>

580
00:29:16.541 --> 00:29:21.541
<v Speaker 6>discussing and then sort of analyzing </v>
<v Speaker 6>with people that you respect and trust </v>

581
00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:23.740
<v Speaker 6>and like and then actually doing the </v>
<v Speaker 6>work.</v>

582
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.760
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think part of it is literally </v>

583
00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.310
<v Speaker 6>working.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I'm getting your hands dirty in </v>

584
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.120
<v Speaker 6>the soil,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like find a as a star.</v>

585
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:38.150
<v Speaker 6>It's just think of it as therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whatever money you're spending on a </v>

586
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.951
<v Speaker 6>therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 6>take take that time and go find a </v>

587
00:29:40.951 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 6>community garden.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just we'd</v>

588
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.040
<v Speaker 5>just go in there and plant some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>find some carrots,</v>

589
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:50.100
<v Speaker 5>do something to just kind of like unplug</v>
<v Speaker 5>and touch dirt and do a thing and </v>

590
00:29:50.501 --> 00:29:55.501
<v Speaker 5>reconnect with that cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you can reconnect with that cycle of </v>

591
00:29:55.501 --> 00:29:57.520
<v Speaker 5>life in some level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you start to really understand what,</v>

592
00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.670
<v Speaker 5>what's more important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

593
00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.980
<v Speaker 5>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people have kids that helps them </v>

594
00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.220
<v Speaker 5>kind of reground themselves and redirect</v>
<v Speaker 5>and focus their energies.</v>

595
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.770
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people will just find,</v>

596
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>find gardening in that way.</v>

597
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:12.450
<v Speaker 5>But this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not this,</v>

598
00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:17.730
<v Speaker 5>this is supposed to be a convenience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is just me trying to talk to you </v>

599
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.551
<v Speaker 5>from a distance and every.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But as far as the information you're </v>

600
00:30:20.551 --> 00:30:22.390
<v Speaker 5>getting off of this thing and forms of </v>
<v Speaker 5>social media,</v>

601
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:25.540
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of poise and there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 5>of misdirect.</v>

602
00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:31.260
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of crap in there and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to kind of fight through it and </v>

603
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.170
<v Speaker 5>literally go eat a garden.</v>

604
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:37.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think just think you're definitely </v>

605
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.430
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think doing that as good.</v>

606
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:38.590
<v Speaker 5>I also think doing difficult things is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is good.</v>

607
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:43.830
<v Speaker 5>I think that's one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're so drawn to Jujitsu and the </v>

608
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:44.750
<v Speaker 5>hardest thing I've ever done in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the hardest thing that it's the,</v>

609
00:30:44.751 --> 00:30:46.300
<v Speaker 5>it's the most.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

610
00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:48.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting no snowflakey be here.</v>

611
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:50.110
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just,</v>

612
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.070
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

613
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:54.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not something that you are handed.</v>

614
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:59.640
<v Speaker 5>You have to do the work to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I had so many injuries over the </v>

615
00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.740
<v Speaker 5>years and it's so much distance from </v>
<v Speaker 5>this thing and I'm such a stubborn prick</v>

616
00:31:02.741 --> 00:31:03.640
<v Speaker 5>that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have,</v>

617
00:31:03.641 --> 00:31:05.650
<v Speaker 5>I've started a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to finish this thing.</v>

618
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:11.190
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's Kinda where I'm at with </v>

619
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.681
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not something that you can be </v>

620
00:31:13.681 --> 00:31:13.681
<v Speaker 5>handled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

621
00:31:13.681 --> 00:31:18.631
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone's legit when they get a fucking </v>

622
00:31:18.631 --> 00:31:19.090
<v Speaker 5>hip surgery and then the back on the mat</v>
<v Speaker 5>four months later,</v>

623
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:24.910
<v Speaker 5>that is first of all ridiculous and not </v>
<v Speaker 5>advisable,</v>

624
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.800
<v Speaker 5>but admirable at the same time.</v>

625
00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.050
<v Speaker 5>It took me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it took me a while to lose the weight.</v>

626
00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:34.060
<v Speaker 5>I was gaining weight before the hip </v>
<v Speaker 5>surgery because I just couldn't move as </v>

627
00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:34.900
<v Speaker 5>well as I wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

628
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:37.270
<v Speaker 5>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was completely destroyed hip.</v>

629
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:38.970
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no cushion in there.</v>

630
00:31:38.971 --> 00:31:41.290
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the recovery was,</v>

631
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:46.520
<v Speaker 5>and then I was on the row,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like one of the worst ways to </v>

632
00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.570
<v Speaker 5>recover from anything you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>recover from being there in the moment.</v>

633
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:55.200
<v Speaker 5>But the thing I did finally found my </v>
<v Speaker 5>rhythm because I think last time we </v>

634
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.110
<v Speaker 5>talked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I talked about how it's hard to train on</v>

635
00:31:56.111 --> 00:31:59.440
<v Speaker 5>the road because I've got this thing I </v>
<v Speaker 5>got to do with at night.</v>

636
00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:05.850
<v Speaker 5>Finding those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>finding the black belts that understand </v>

637
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:09.560
<v Speaker 5>the low,</v>
<v Speaker 5>low impact flow role,</v>

638
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>putting threads together.</v>

639
00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:15.670
<v Speaker 5>Just doing simple a positional drills,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all those things.</v>

640
00:32:15.671 --> 00:32:17.470
<v Speaker 5>Now I've been able to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I,</v>

641
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I trained with Dave and Dan Camereo,</v>

642
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:23.630
<v Speaker 5>Henry Akins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rodrigo comes down,</v>

643
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.910
<v Speaker 5>touch flocks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>comes down.</v>

644
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:29.170
<v Speaker 5>I've been able to train with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people on the road that's amazing.</v>

645
00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.170
<v Speaker 5>May Not be folk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We find our,</v>

646
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:36.300
<v Speaker 5>we find our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our right before sound check and you </v>

647
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:36.610
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it has to be people that trust us to</v>

648
00:32:36.611 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 5>be people that have an understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not here to do this,</v>

649
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to do the same music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

650
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.960
<v Speaker 1>This is just something that helps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to that.</v>

651
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

652
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm just chipping away at that purple </v>
<v Speaker 1>belt,</v>

653
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:49.900
<v Speaker 1>trying to get to that next level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

654
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:53.780
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drills or like one of the most important</v>

655
00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:56.080
<v Speaker 1>things that people don't like to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

656
00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.490
<v Speaker 1>It's just one of those things where it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

657
00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:02.090
<v Speaker 1>like rolling and sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fun that people just want to get</v>

658
00:33:02.091 --> 00:33:03.140
<v Speaker 1>right in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just roll it.</v>

659
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Let's just roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you just kind of do it,</v>

660
00:33:04.761 --> 00:33:07.460
<v Speaker 1>but the real work is done in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>drilling.</v>

661
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:09.860
<v Speaker 1>If you can't do it slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do it fast,</v>

662
00:33:09.861 --> 00:33:12.830
<v Speaker 1>especially if you don't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what it is you're supposed to</v>

663
00:33:12.831 --> 00:33:15.140
<v Speaker 1>be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you have a good part,</v>

664
00:33:15.141 --> 00:33:20.141
<v Speaker 1>a training partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>role player to help you and he's giving </v>

665
00:33:20.141 --> 00:33:22.190
<v Speaker 1>you the exact position that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're trying to train.</v>

666
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:25.010
<v Speaker 1>If he got one of those pricks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like blue belt,</v>

667
00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:25.830
<v Speaker 1>purple belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>garlic,</v>

668
00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.600
<v Speaker 1>no miss going to church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to adjust this position to no,</v>

669
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:31.280
<v Speaker 1>that's not what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what you're here for.</v>

670
00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Your troubles are important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like dead drills are important to </v>

671
00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:37.280
<v Speaker 1>where a person just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just roll,</v>

672
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.380
<v Speaker 1>just roll through the technique with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

673
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

674
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like I've always found it </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting how many people like </v>

675
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.590
<v Speaker 1>find it sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

676
00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.780
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their life.</v>

677
00:33:47.781 --> 00:33:52.781
<v Speaker 1>And it becomes like almost like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>replacement for religion and a lot of </v>

678
00:33:52.781 --> 00:33:54.170
<v Speaker 1>ways it comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this grounding thing for them.</v>

679
00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see that.</v>

680
00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just,</v>

681
00:33:56.721 --> 00:34:01.721
<v Speaker 1>it seems like the real difficult things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Jujitsu or whatever you're </v>

682
00:34:01.721 --> 00:34:01.721
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

683
00:34:01.721 --> 00:34:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy that's into ultra </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathons.</v>

684
00:34:03.471 --> 00:34:05.090
<v Speaker 1>That's his thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's just like pushy.</v>

685
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:10.120
<v Speaker 1>His body to run these crazy distances </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes like this weird sort of like </v>

686
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.970
<v Speaker 1>centering threatened his life because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows it's so fucking difficult that all</v>

687
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:16.040
<v Speaker 1>the other things get easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

688
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:16.970
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

689
00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:19.330
<v Speaker 1>That's kick and run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

690
00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:22.550
<v Speaker 1>that's good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll let him do that.</v>

691
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.100
<v Speaker 1>But you said that some people can run </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a hip replacement?</v>

692
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that there's some guys that </v>

693
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:30.160
<v Speaker 1>they'll go in every couple of years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the,</v>

694
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:33.860
<v Speaker 1>the actual pad of Ithaca silicone pad or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that they're just.</v>

695
00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.200
<v Speaker 1>They just cut them open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like small incision.</v>

696
00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Pop it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop the hip out.</v>

697
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess during the surgery they go in </v>

698
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:43.960
<v Speaker 1>from the front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike.</v>

699
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.511
<v Speaker 1>I went from the front so that you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>my leg was laying across my head while </v>

700
00:34:46.511 --> 00:34:49.931
<v Speaker 1>they're in there digging my you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a full on scoping out the the </v>

701
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.820
<v Speaker 1>hip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sawing,</v>

702
00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:56.900
<v Speaker 1>sawing off the hip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leg,</v>

703
00:34:56.901 --> 00:35:01.901
<v Speaker 1>the femur bone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting a spike down the middle of your </v>

704
00:35:01.901 --> 00:35:05.171
<v Speaker 1>femur with a ball on top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then putting it back in and then </v>

705
00:35:05.171 --> 00:35:05.780
<v Speaker 1>waking you up about an hour later going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go for a walk.</v>

706
00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many?</v>

707
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:12.130
<v Speaker 1>How many inches is the spike?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A spike that goes into the ball?</v>

708
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like about 20 Irish inches.</v>

709
00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:16.280
<v Speaker 1>The size of my deck.</v>

710
00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we talking about?</v>

711
00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:22.220
<v Speaker 1>The deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

712
00:35:22.221 --> 00:35:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Look how far it goes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

713
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>

714
00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

715
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

716
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's freaking me out.</v>

717
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.470
<v Speaker 1>How does that not just like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanical leverage,</v>

718
00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.520
<v Speaker 1>seems like it would just snap your </v>
<v Speaker 1>femur.</v>

719
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a leg kick.</v>

720
00:35:40.861 --> 00:35:42.600
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you'd be taken down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

721
00:35:42.601 --> 00:35:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

722
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please don't.</v>

723
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Please don't give so many right at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of that spike.</v>

724
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:50.340
<v Speaker 1>That's a wrap on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

725
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:52.890
<v Speaker 1>I feel like right where that spike </v>
<v Speaker 1>connects to the meet.</v>

726
00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:57.060
<v Speaker 1>I feel like someone who's got a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>good leg kick,</v>

727
00:35:57.061 --> 00:35:59.340
<v Speaker 1>which is going right through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>

728
00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:04.341
<v Speaker 1>but I think the bone density a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens with the bone density is </v>

729
00:36:04.341 --> 00:36:08.091
<v Speaker 1>that's why the appealing process is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>slow because the bone is actually </v>

730
00:36:08.091 --> 00:36:08.091
<v Speaker 1>healing around that thing.</v>

731
00:36:08.091 --> 00:36:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's maybe in theory more dense than </v>

732
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:12.900
<v Speaker 1>the actual spike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

733
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:15.840
<v Speaker 1>but you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the physics of hitting kicking that</v>

734
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.370
<v Speaker 1>you would think would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your.</v>

735
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.800
<v Speaker 1>That's your weak spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about like falling and stuff?</v>

736
00:36:19.801 --> 00:36:24.801
<v Speaker 1>Do they advise you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing they don't have you do is </v>

737
00:36:24.801 --> 00:36:26.220
<v Speaker 1>if you were to bend my leg back when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>need back that way,</v>

738
00:36:26.221 --> 00:36:29.250
<v Speaker 1>like a lunge back onto this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

739
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:34.280
<v Speaker 1>it will pop out forward of Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm even with no wait a no.</v>

740
00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.270
<v Speaker 1>It would have to be some kind of weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will push forward.</v>

741
00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:43.020
<v Speaker 1>It used to be the way if I put my knees </v>
<v Speaker 1>up on my chest to do like butterfly,</v>

742
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:48.680
<v Speaker 1>the way that they designed the hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>before it would actually pop out that </v>

743
00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:48.680
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now they've fixed it where it's like</v>

744
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:52.050
<v Speaker 1>it has to be this other extreme angle to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it to pop out,</v>

745
00:36:52.051 --> 00:36:53.070
<v Speaker 1>but it can pop out.</v>

746
00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Has it popped out on you yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

747
00:36:54.931 --> 00:36:59.931
<v Speaker 1>it has not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do any weight lifting to </v>

748
00:36:59.931 --> 00:37:00.460
<v Speaker 1>strengthen everything around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of,</v>

749
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:02.150
<v Speaker 1>a lot of walking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

750
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

751
00:37:03.661 --> 00:37:08.661
<v Speaker 1>some weight training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the kettle bells when </v>

752
00:37:08.661 --> 00:37:08.720
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

753
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.890
<v Speaker 1>I think just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that wrestling,</v>

754
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working with somebody,</v>

755
00:37:12.571 --> 00:37:14.570
<v Speaker 1>not actually doing the take downs for </v>
<v Speaker 1>warmup.</v>

756
00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I'd do take downs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

757
00:37:16.381 --> 00:37:21.381
<v Speaker 1>just that act of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of lateral front back and then having </v>

758
00:37:21.381 --> 00:37:23.400
<v Speaker 1>somebody pull you with those different </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways and the low stance.</v>

759
00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low stance.</v>

760
00:37:24.361 --> 00:37:27.900
<v Speaker 1>I liked that low center of gravity drop </v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's good for the legs for sure.</v>

761
00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:32.340
<v Speaker 1>So kettlebells that the battle ropes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those do body weight squats.</v>

762
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I do not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of body weight squats.</v>

763
00:37:36.001 --> 00:37:37.320
<v Speaker 1>You're Hindu squats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call them.</v>

764
00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Which type of squat that you do.</v>

765
00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Will you do like a lot of reps?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do 200 reps and what it's hard to </v>

766
00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:45.040
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

767
00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.010
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's easy because you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first 10,</v>

768
00:37:47.011 --> 00:37:49.410
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do 200 and then you get to 20.</v>

769
00:37:49.411 --> 00:37:50.060
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

770
00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.440
<v Speaker 1>And then you get to 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's no way you just,</v>

771
00:37:52.441 --> 00:37:54.030
<v Speaker 1>you doing your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just me.</v>

772
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.770
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go down,</v>

773
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.860
<v Speaker 1>you go down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you touched your,</v>

774
00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.990
<v Speaker 1>you drop your hands back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you touch your hands to the ground.</v>

775
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.270
<v Speaker 1>And then as you go up you bring your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands up for like,</v>

776
00:38:03.271 --> 00:38:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like this.</v>

777
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.160
<v Speaker 1>It looks like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hang on,</v>

778
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:13.250
<v Speaker 1>hang on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called Hindu squatting and gotta get </v>

779
00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:13.250
<v Speaker 1>counter ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you stand like this and you,</v>

780
00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:16.440
<v Speaker 1>you stand with your back straight up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hands are like behind your button.</v>

781
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:19.740
<v Speaker 1>You go down like this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

782
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:20.970
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>

783
00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:23.340
<v Speaker 1>And as I'm going down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my heels go up.</v>

784
00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.700
<v Speaker 1>So at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at the bottom,</v>

785
00:38:26.701 --> 00:38:31.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually on the ball of my feet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my hands go behind my heels,</v>

786
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as I come up,</v>

787
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:38.090
<v Speaker 1>I touched the ground and I go up to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>position and I breathe out as I do this,</v>

788
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 of these bitches.</v>

789
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.670
<v Speaker 1>I just done like five and I'm ready to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a nap.</v>

790
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:50.410
<v Speaker 1>He'll just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a donut.</v>

791
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Can we just have donuts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

792
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:52.740
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm A.</v>

793
00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.310
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people don't do enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit with their legs.</v>

794
00:38:57.311 --> 00:39:02.311
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the more shit you do with your </v>

795
00:39:02.311 --> 00:39:02.920
<v Speaker 1>legs where it's running or squatting or </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead lifting?</v>

796
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:06.310
<v Speaker 1>It just your whole body feels better and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people neglect that shit.</v>

797
00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do more leg,</v>

798
00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:08.470
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

799
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Then I do arm stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think my next step is I talked about </v>

800
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:13.470
<v Speaker 1>before is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

801
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:15.760
<v Speaker 1>I had broken my wrists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the last time I was in here,</v>

802
00:39:15.761 --> 00:39:17.570
<v Speaker 1>I like that actually was a broken wrist </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

803
00:39:17.571 --> 00:39:19.850
<v Speaker 1>A sprained wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

804
00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.880
<v Speaker 1>So I actually broke both my wrists that </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

805
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had shoulder issues.</v>

806
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:28.750
<v Speaker 1>A rotator shit issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one thing too that I did those,</v>

807
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stem cells and not the,</v>

808
00:39:30.731 --> 00:39:32.740
<v Speaker 1>a prp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the PRP.</v>

809
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:33.920
<v Speaker 1>The other one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one?</v>

810
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

811
00:39:35.141 --> 00:39:36.100
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where'd you do it?</v>

812
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Arizona they were,</v>

813
00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.220
<v Speaker 1>they were doing show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

814
00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.390
<v Speaker 1>They're not cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

815
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:42.150
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not cheap.</v>

816
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:43.990
<v Speaker 1>They take your own blood and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

817
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regina King must be something different.</v>

818
00:39:46.481 --> 00:39:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

819
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

820
00:39:49.061 --> 00:39:50.950
<v Speaker 1>And then I started researching going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

821
00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:55.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just discovered Hep c a couple of </v>

822
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.531
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I shouldn't be putting some kind </v>

823
00:39:58.531 --> 00:39:58.531
<v Speaker 1>of weird foreign shit.</v>

824
00:39:58.531 --> 00:39:58.610
<v Speaker 1>And they just discovered Hep c a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years.</v>

825
00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Just hepatitis than general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

826
00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:02.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like on the rise.</v>

827
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago people didn't know what the</v>

828
00:40:04.931 --> 00:40:05.880
<v Speaker 1>hell that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

829
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 1>30 years ago they just thought people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were skanks.</v>

830
00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.680
<v Speaker 1>There are no gangs have actually like </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible diseases,</v>

831
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.420
<v Speaker 1>male and female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking and just in general,</v>

832
00:40:14.421 --> 00:40:15.490
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

833
00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.390
<v Speaker 1>things that we hear here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take some Prozac and then no,</v>

834
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:24.540
<v Speaker 1>don't take any PROZAC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just changing their minds about every </v>

835
00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.020
<v Speaker 1>thing that they put in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are polite of you,</v>

836
00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:27.550
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

837
00:40:27.551 --> 00:40:28.330
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

838
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:29.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

839
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:34.170
<v Speaker 1>I stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do more what you were doing </v>

840
00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:35.020
<v Speaker 1>with the actually spinning out your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>stem cells.</v>

841
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:38.860
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of different procedures</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're doing now.</v>

842
00:40:38.861 --> 00:40:43.861
<v Speaker 1>One of them that's really important as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're shooting stem cells directly </v>

843
00:40:43.861 --> 00:40:45.410
<v Speaker 1>into disc tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people that have bulging discs in my,</v>

844
00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:50.490
<v Speaker 1>they're able to heal the discs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually create more disc tissue and </v>

845
00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:54.120
<v Speaker 1>this is all super cutting edge stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the stem cell technologies,</v>

846
00:40:54.121 --> 00:40:58.060
<v Speaker 1>some of the most intriguing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating things going on right now in</v>

847
00:40:58.061 --> 00:40:58.930
<v Speaker 1>modern medicine.</v>

848
00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:01.660
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're able to do amazing work.</v>

849
00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:02.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

850
00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.800
<v Speaker 1>they think that within a few years </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be able to fix things.</v>

851
00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Here's one thing they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is really important for people.</v>

852
00:41:08.561 --> 00:41:13.561
<v Speaker 1>I better not forget this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the used to blow out things like </v>

853
00:41:13.561 --> 00:41:15.220
<v Speaker 1>acl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to have to replace it.</v>

854
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:20.250
<v Speaker 1>They used to either replace it with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cadaver ligament or they would replace </v>

855
00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:20.440
<v Speaker 1>it with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

856
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:25.800
<v Speaker 1>your Pete Patella tendon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would cut a piece of that like I </v>

857
00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.780
<v Speaker 1>had that done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they would take your hamstring.</v>

858
00:41:26.781 --> 00:41:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they take a chunk of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hamstring and they screw it in place.</v>

859
00:41:28.931 --> 00:41:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Now they have a new method real knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they can actually.</v>

860
00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 1>They've figured out a way to</v>

861
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.980
<v Speaker 3>repair the actual acl itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They figured out how to tie it back </v>

862
00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.890
<v Speaker 3>together again in heals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It heals way quicker.</v>

863
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:48.160
<v Speaker 3>You're walking almost instantly like </v>
<v Speaker 3>after the surgery and you're back to </v>

864
00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.630
<v Speaker 3>action in three months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a totally different ballgame.</v>

865
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.960
<v Speaker 3>They had this guy who competed in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympics five months after getting the </v>

866
00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:00.581
<v Speaker 3>surgery on his Achilles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He blew out his Achilles and he used to </v>

867
00:42:00.581 --> 00:42:02.630
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously your leg was useless and</v>

868
00:42:02.631 --> 00:42:07.631
<v Speaker 3>it was useless for like a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this guy is five months later is </v>

869
00:42:07.631 --> 00:42:09.260
<v Speaker 3>competing in the Olympics and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting stem cells in there to help the</v>

870
00:42:09.261 --> 00:42:11.480
<v Speaker 3>healing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy what's going on right</v>

871
00:42:11.481 --> 00:42:13.910
<v Speaker 3>now that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're living in an awesome time.</v>

872
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:18.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean for a guy like Hickson who has </v>

873
00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:18.970
<v Speaker 3>all those back problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

874
00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:19.730
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's get them on that.</v>

875
00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:20.960
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

876
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:26.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Hixon is all like holistic </v>

877
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:26.080
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

878
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.350
<v Speaker 3>he wants to just do yoga and ride off </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the sunset on somebody like a pale </v>

879
00:42:29.601 --> 00:42:30.750
<v Speaker 3>horse or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

881
00:42:32.061 --> 00:42:37.061
<v Speaker 3>Like meditate on something where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>light it on fire and that's how he's </v>

882
00:42:37.061 --> 00:42:37.061
<v Speaker 3>going to go out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

884
00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:43.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much he's into getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of stuff shot into him.</v>

885
00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:48.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I admire that a lot of ways.</v>

886
00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:53.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a fascinating character and he's </v>

887
00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:53.620
<v Speaker 3>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

888
00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.610
<v Speaker 3>that opened up a lot of people's eyes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>yoga from that choke documentary.</v>

889
00:42:56.611 --> 00:42:57.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

890

<v Speaker 3>Now he's in his fifties.</v>

901
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.640
<v Speaker 3>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quite a quite a fascinating guy,</v>

902
00:43:23.641 --> 00:43:27.930
<v Speaker 3>but not interested in getting shot up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with stem cells.</v>

00:44:22.531 --> 00:44:24.800
<v Speaker 3>route and said he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He felt like he had power coming.</v>

926
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:25.050
<v Speaker 3>He</v>

927
00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:27.270
<v Speaker 8>lies.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was like I had light coming out of my</v>

928
00:44:27.271 --> 00:44:28.180
<v Speaker 8>hands like that.</v>

929
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.680
<v Speaker 3>Like the first time you did meth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

930
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.760
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's better than that.</v>

931
00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.230
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do better than that.</v>

932
00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:39.630
<v Speaker 3>Meth and ecstasy together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

933
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like a little like your energetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're also loving.</v>

934
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:44.290
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

935
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:49.390
<v Speaker 3>what we're doing right now where I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>within the next 20 or 30 years we're </v>

936
00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:51.210
<v Speaker 3>going to have a real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real problem with people not dying.</v>

937
00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:55.170
<v Speaker 3>GRANDPA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now with the current administration,</v>

938
00:44:55.171 --> 00:44:58.000
<v Speaker 3>I think it could be all right with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that motherfucker,</v>

939
00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:03.020
<v Speaker 3>he so ego maniacal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think you'd be shooting stem </v>

940
00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:03.020
<v Speaker 3>cells into himself and tries to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself alive forever?</v>

941
00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:07.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's going to send anybody else off </v>

942
00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:08.310
<v Speaker 3>to go fight for the materials that go </v>
<v Speaker 3>into those shots.</v>

943
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:13.580
<v Speaker 3>Madge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you trump found out about it before </v>

944
00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:14.310
<v Speaker 3>anybody started reverse aging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Benjamin buttons would be amazing.</v>

945
00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:16.320
<v Speaker 3>Just all of a sudden trump is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>younger again,</v>

946
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:18.360
<v Speaker 3>kind of freaking everybody out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know he's 90,</v>

947
00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:20.140
<v Speaker 5>but he looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

948
00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:25.920
<v Speaker 5>As long as he goes all the way down and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we can put them over your knee and like </v>

949
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:25.920
<v Speaker 5>a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Give him a time out.</v>

950
00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:28.000
<v Speaker 5>What do you think he's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 5>with this dude?</v>

951
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.410
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a smokescreen.</v>

952
00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.600
<v Speaker 5>I think there's so many other things </v>
<v Speaker 5>going on that,</v>

953
00:45:34.601 --> 00:45:36.490
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we're not paying attention to,</v>

954
00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.710
<v Speaker 5>but it is a testament to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

955
00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:45.210
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just the level of frustrations I think </v>

956
00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:48.000
<v Speaker 5>that people have had just with </v>
<v Speaker 5>government in general and the Internet </v>

957
00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:52.540
<v Speaker 5>and social media has been able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>polarize us all enough to where we don't</v>

958
00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:55.190
<v Speaker 5>talk to each other to really sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>sought out some of the,</v>

959
00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the actual issues that are going on.</v>

960
00:45:57.011 --> 00:46:02.011
<v Speaker 5>So they had this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this spectacle I'm going on right now </v>

961
00:46:03.851 --> 00:46:04.710
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

962
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:06.760
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>

963
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:13.300
<v Speaker 3>It is a spectacle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I always wonder whether or not it's </v>

964
00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.191
<v Speaker 3>an orchestra orchestrated spectacle or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether we just try to find patterns </v>

965
00:46:15.191 --> 00:46:16.170
<v Speaker 3>when patterns don't even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what it really is,</v>

966
00:46:16.171 --> 00:46:21.171
<v Speaker 3>is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just a goofy dude who loves </v>

967
00:46:21.171 --> 00:46:25.061
<v Speaker 3>attention and we have a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>popularity contest to see who runs the </v>

968
00:46:25.061 --> 00:46:25.620
<v Speaker 3>country and you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I say,</v>

969
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.200
<v Speaker 3>go back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just back it up</v>

970
00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:30.160
<v Speaker 5>to see where people really frustrated </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the Obama administration.</v>

971
00:46:30.161 --> 00:46:32.260
<v Speaker 5>Were they frustrated with the Bush </v>
<v Speaker 5>administration?</v>

972
00:46:32.261 --> 00:46:33.500
<v Speaker 5>Whether you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether is it,</v>

973
00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:37.960
<v Speaker 5>is it connected or are they just looking</v>
<v Speaker 5>for something different?</v>

974
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:42.990
<v Speaker 5>Because if you look historically at at </v>
<v Speaker 5>places that have had some success as a </v>

975
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:45.190
<v Speaker 5>country and then they have some </v>
<v Speaker 5>problems,</v>

976
00:46:45.191 --> 00:46:50.191
<v Speaker 5>we started seeing some issues and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just whatever the incumbent a </v>

977
00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:52.660
<v Speaker 5>person is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the party,</v>

978
00:46:52.661 --> 00:46:56.080
<v Speaker 5>the group I'm all they want is something</v>
<v Speaker 5>else.</v>

979
00:46:56.081 --> 00:46:57.930
<v Speaker 5>Something different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We want to get rid of that,</v>

980
00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:01.150
<v Speaker 5>but something different in and </v>
<v Speaker 5>historically when that happens,</v>

981
00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:06.720
<v Speaker 5>shit just go sideways that just pick it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just wanted anything else and they </v>

982
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.080
<v Speaker 5>got exactly what they got.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something worse.</v>

983
00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:08.900
<v Speaker 5>Worse.</v>

984
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem is worrying about it </v>

985
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:15.170
<v Speaker 3>the same way you worried about </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>

986
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:19.311
<v Speaker 3>Like one guy can one day create one </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and it fucking ruins everything </v>

987
00:47:19.311 --> 00:47:20.400
<v Speaker 3>and you almost feel like that with like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a president.</v>

988
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:25.430
<v Speaker 3>Like we can ask for something different </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then one day we get it and it </v>

989
00:47:25.561 --> 00:47:29.620
<v Speaker 3>fucking ruins everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I worry about is</v>

990
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.980
<v Speaker 6>a lot of what he's doing with this </v>
<v Speaker 6>battle against the intelligence </v>

991
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.220
<v Speaker 6>agencies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all the shitty talks about them.</v>

992
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:41.530
<v Speaker 6>It's like if they start hiding stuff </v>
<v Speaker 6>from him because they're worried that </v>

993
00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:42.140
<v Speaker 6>he's going to tell stuff to Russian guys</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

994
00:47:42.141 --> 00:47:47.141
<v Speaker 6>and talk about certain things like he </v>
<v Speaker 6>revealed top secret information about </v>

995
00:47:47.141 --> 00:47:51.090
<v Speaker 6>isis wants to use laptops is bombed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He told the Russians that if they can't </v>

996
00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:54.850
<v Speaker 6>trust him and if they developed this </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing where it's them versus him.</v>

997
00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:58.840
<v Speaker 6>Did you gotta you got a real serious </v>
<v Speaker 6>problem on your hands that.</v>

998
00:47:58.841 --> 00:48:03.841
<v Speaker 6>Because that's gonna that attitude's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to carry onto the next </v>

999
00:48:03.841 --> 00:48:06.210
<v Speaker 6>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's pants or some Democrat or </v>

1000
00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:06.210
<v Speaker 6>whoever the fuck comes in after him.</v>

1001
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:08.410
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck man.</v>

1002
00:48:08.411 --> 00:48:09.230
<v Speaker 5>It's all scary.</v>

1003
00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:11.840
<v Speaker 6>It's just people didn't know what they </v>
<v Speaker 6>were voting for.</v>

1004
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:16.960
<v Speaker 6>They didn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They thought they thought it was going </v>

1005
00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:16.960
<v Speaker 6>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to drain the swamp.</v>

1006
00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:20.630
<v Speaker 6>Like this motherfucker just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he just backed up the biggest sewer </v>

1007
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:24.620
<v Speaker 6>truck ever to the swamp and he's shit in</v>
<v Speaker 6>there like crazy.</v>

1008
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.120
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1009
00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:26.280
<v Speaker 5>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1010
00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.310
<v Speaker 5>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think the,</v>

1011
00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:33.120
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the all again y'all.</v>

1012
00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:36.610
<v Speaker 5>All we can do I think is to step back </v>
<v Speaker 5>and fight.</v>

1013
00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:38.590
<v Speaker 5>Fight the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So here,</v>

1014
00:48:38.591 --> 00:48:43.591
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you can think of the battlefield as </v>

1015
00:48:43.591 --> 00:48:43.591
<v Speaker 5>being your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your old school,</v>

1016
00:48:43.591 --> 00:48:44.170
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1017
00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.950
<v Speaker 5>there's the goals over there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Capture the flag kind of battlefield.</v>

1018
00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:52.480
<v Speaker 5>Your first battle is his ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your first enemy is ignorance.</v>

1019
00:48:52.481 --> 00:48:56.320
<v Speaker 5>Trying to figure out how to get past the</v>
<v Speaker 5>misinformation that you know,</v>

1020
00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:58.660
<v Speaker 5>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just to get past ignorance.</v>

1021
00:48:58.680 --> 00:48:59.890
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>
<v Speaker 5>educate yourself.</v>

1022
00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:02.380
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the earth is not flat.</v>

1023
00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:07.620
<v Speaker 6>You don't think there it's flat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think we need to see a rock from the </v>

1024
00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.250
<v Speaker 6>sky slam into the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's what we need.</v>

1025
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.180
<v Speaker 6>We need like a small European city wiped</v>
<v Speaker 6>out just so we go,</v>

1026
00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:14.440
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1027
00:49:14.441 --> 00:49:15.470
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well this is,</v>

1028
00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.650
<v Speaker 6>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are we concentrating on?</v>

1029
00:49:17.651 --> 00:49:20.510
<v Speaker 6>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Goddamn shooting gallery art.</v>

1030
00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:25.540
<v Speaker 6>Life is just so short.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't understand the real spans of </v>

1031
00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:25.540
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1032
00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:30.270
<v Speaker 6>We don't understand that periodically.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This fucking whole thing's going to get </v>

1033
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:30.270
<v Speaker 6>rattled.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1034
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:31.480
<v Speaker 6>Extremely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No doubt about it.</v>

1035
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:32.200
<v Speaker 6>It's coming.</v>

1036
00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:34.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think that's,</v>

1037
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:35.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's idle,</v>

1038
00:49:35.261 --> 00:49:37.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>idle hands are the devil's playground.</v>

1039
00:49:37.791 --> 00:49:39.920
<v Speaker 5>You've heard that cliche and I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>that really is,</v>

1040
00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.330
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1041
00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.520
<v Speaker 5>so my prepper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that prepper side of me is that person </v>

1042
00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:48.520
<v Speaker 5>who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1043
00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.260
<v Speaker 5>what if we don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if you don't have electricity for a</v>

1044
00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.930
<v Speaker 5>week because whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for whatever reason,</v>

1045
00:49:53.931 --> 00:49:54.830
<v Speaker 5>why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1046
00:49:54.831 --> 00:49:55.300
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1047
00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:58.280
<v Speaker 5>just be having an understanding of what </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is.</v>

1048
00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:01.910
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that one is just a starter,</v>

1049
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:04.250
<v Speaker 5>a precursor or just a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

1050
00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:09.340
<v Speaker 5>a dry run of what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what happens when that rock does fall </v>

1051
00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:10.670
<v Speaker 5>from the sky because it happens all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time because,</v>

1052
00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:15.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>historically historically of happens a </v>

1053
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:15.760
<v Speaker 5>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1054
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.410
<v Speaker 5>and I do believe that that is the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be the,</v>

1055
00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:23.000
<v Speaker 5>that would be the reset button.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I prefer not to have that be the reset,</v>

1056
00:50:23.001 --> 00:50:28.001
<v Speaker 5>but I'd prefer to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their consciousness caught up with </v>

1057
00:50:28.001 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 5>itself and we just kind of start to each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

1058
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:30.470
<v Speaker 1>I would like that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we need something.</v>

1059
00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little shake them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it doesn't even have to hit a </v>

1060
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.591
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how about hit the ocean and we </v>

1061
00:50:38.591 --> 00:50:40.691
<v Speaker 1>catch it on video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just bone mile high waves wipes out all </v>

1062
00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:43.610
<v Speaker 1>of Carbon Beach Malibu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

1063
00:50:43.611 --> 00:50:45.560
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those billion dollar,</v>

1064
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.620
<v Speaker 1>they call that billionaire beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking assholes.</v>

1065
00:50:48.621 --> 00:50:51.560
<v Speaker 1>They would only work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would only work if it,</v>

1066
00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:54.330
<v Speaker 1>if it was a global event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1067
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Because if it's isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we've had tsunamis so large,</v>

1068
00:50:58.550 --> 00:50:59.660
<v Speaker 1>we don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Large cities,</v>

1069
00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.510
<v Speaker 1>nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody does anything about it.</v>

1070
00:51:01.511 --> 00:51:04.160
<v Speaker 1>It would have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had Katrina that,</v>

1071
00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:09.161
<v Speaker 1>but that's down there with those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs to be something that's </v>

1072
00:51:09.161 --> 00:51:13.490
<v Speaker 1>nationwide that that hits all of us at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time where we stopped with this</v>

1073
00:51:13.491 --> 00:51:18.491
<v Speaker 1>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop with this polarized bullshit and </v>

1074
00:51:18.491 --> 00:51:18.491
<v Speaker 1>start talking to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what happens.</v>

1075
00:51:18.491 --> 00:51:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Connor connects with the lefthand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>floyd methods when made,</v>

1076
00:51:20.691 --> 00:51:25.691
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Chin Floyd goes down and at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the count of eight when he's about to </v>

1077
00:51:25.691 --> 00:51:30.461
<v Speaker 1>get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole arena gets hit with a media </v>

1078
00:51:30.461 --> 00:51:33.820
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last Vegas is wiped off the face of the </v>

1079
00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:33.920
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's dead,</v>

1080
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.980
<v Speaker 1>but we saw the feed up until the </v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroid impact it.</v>

1081
00:51:36.981 --> 00:51:41.981
<v Speaker 1>Just one big bright spark of light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then everybody starts tuning into </v>

1082
00:51:41.981 --> 00:51:45.250
<v Speaker 1>CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge crater where vegas used </v>

1083
00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:47.291
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the asteroid though has an emp that </v>

1084
00:51:47.291 --> 00:51:49.901
<v Speaker 1>hits every single fee that goes to every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single camera and TV and it wipes out </v>

1085
00:51:49.901 --> 00:51:52.300
<v Speaker 1>every electronic device that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching the whole thing now.</v>

1086
00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Now you're getting too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

1087
00:51:55.461 --> 00:51:57.260
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we just need to wipe out?</v>

1088
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:59.690
<v Speaker 1>They helped me out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even need to wipe out Vegas.</v>

1089
00:51:59.691 --> 00:52:01.010
<v Speaker 1>I Love Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>

1090
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like we need something where</v>

1091
00:52:04.161 --> 00:52:05.720
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to.</v>

1092
00:52:05.721 --> 00:52:08.300
<v Speaker 1>It has to affect them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to affect them on some level.</v>

1093
00:52:08.301 --> 00:52:09.380
<v Speaker 1>That actually the</v>

1094
00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:14.110
<v Speaker 5>kickstarts their compassion gene.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

1095
00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:19.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to have a balance between your </v>

1096
00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:19.140
<v Speaker 5>survival gene and your compassion Jane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you know,</v>

1097
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:22.680
<v Speaker 5>you got to figure back a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing that,</v>

1098
00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:27.860
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that helped us be here today is we </v>

1099
00:52:30.211 --> 00:52:31.410
<v Speaker 5>weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we weren't stronger.</v>

1100
00:52:31.411 --> 00:52:33.540
<v Speaker 5>We weren't faster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1101
00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:39.050
<v Speaker 5>than we are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We weren't larger than the things that </v>

1102
00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:39.050
<v Speaker 5>we're eating us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had to be smarter.</v>

1103
00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:43.221
<v Speaker 5>We have to be clever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had to come up with ways to create </v>

1104
00:52:43.221 --> 00:52:47.150
<v Speaker 5>something from nothing to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>defend ourselves against predators or </v>

1105
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:48.930
<v Speaker 5>refinanced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that creative,</v>

1106
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:52.920
<v Speaker 5>that creative juice was there and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>were trying to,</v>

1107
00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:54.750
<v Speaker 5>we were establishing food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shelter,</v>

1108
00:52:54.751 --> 00:52:59.190
<v Speaker 5>and clothing as well as keeping </v>
<v Speaker 5>protected from predators.</v>

1109
00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:04.790
<v Speaker 5>And it was that creative side of us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that artistic side of us that actually </v>

1110
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:07.770
<v Speaker 5>was too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what you have to think that,</v>

1111
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:11.850
<v Speaker 5>that creative side of us to keep us </v>
<v Speaker 5>ahead of these creatures,</v>

1112
00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:13.720
<v Speaker 5>the elements,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1113
00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:16.290
<v Speaker 5>all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as time has gone on,</v>

1114
00:53:16.291 --> 00:53:18.480
<v Speaker 5>when you no longer are threatened by </v>
<v Speaker 5>these things,</v>

1115
00:53:18.481 --> 00:53:20.460
<v Speaker 5>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's plenty of clothes everywhere.</v>

1116
00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:23.820
<v Speaker 5>Pretty much plenty of food everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 5>where we live and a lot of idle hands,</v>

1117
00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 5>idle hands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we've lost</v>

1118
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.970
<v Speaker 1>touch with that imminent threats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have,</v>

1119
00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:34.290
<v Speaker 1>we started to turn on each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those girls with fake assets.</v>

1120
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.500
<v Speaker 1>People get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm mad that he has a lady.</v>

1121
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:39.890
<v Speaker 1>What's her name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you.</v>

1122
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I was eating all these people angry at </v>
<v Speaker 1>her because there were assets,</v>

1123
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:43.980
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>

1124
00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:46.800
<v Speaker 1>just angry at a fake ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1125
00:53:46.801 --> 00:53:51.150
<v Speaker 1>they don't even have a mic rib here at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mcdonald's Arizona.</v>

1126
00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Keep them big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rib Eye had 12 seasons.</v>

1127
00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:55.230
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1128
00:53:55.410 --> 00:54:00.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no disrespect to the people that they </v>

1129
00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:00.420
<v Speaker 1>get caught up in that broken nail </v>
<v Speaker 1>syndrome,</v>

1130
00:54:00.421 --> 00:54:02.310
<v Speaker 1>but like that is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your,</v>

1131
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:07.490
<v Speaker 1>your tragedies are not tragedies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we need some kind of life threatening</v>

1132
00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:12.960
<v Speaker 1>something that's really global and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It crosses religious,</v>

1133
00:54:12.961 --> 00:54:15.150
<v Speaker 1>economic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

1134
00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:17.880
<v Speaker 1>racial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to cross all those lines to where</v>

1135
00:54:17.881 --> 00:54:20.730
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1136
00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to expose micro aggressions for </v>

1137
00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:25.970
<v Speaker 1>the preposterous notion that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>really are.</v>

1138
00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Like if you get hit in the head with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

1139
00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:30.990
<v Speaker 1>someone gets mad at a microaggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1140
00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:35.280
<v Speaker 1>there are two very different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that meter almost hit him.</v>

1141
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see.</v>

1142
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:40.570

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>21.</v>

1169
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did some.</v>

1170
00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:38.260
<v Speaker 1>We did you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He raped me that night.</v>

1171
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Not Financially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1172
00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:45.050
<v Speaker 1>Financially and it wasn't my idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how to spend that much </v>

1173
00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:45.050
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what kind of wine that was,</v>

1174
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:47.610
<v Speaker 1>but it was fascinating wine that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1175
00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is wine.</v>

1176
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda got it for a brief moment.</v>

1177
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I wandered off on some tangent.</v>

1178
00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I think I actually said I think as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1179
00:55:56.611 --> 00:55:59.880
<v Speaker 1>set up a fight with me and bordain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to fight somebody.</v>

1180
00:55:59.881 --> 00:56:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was important to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One day might kill you,</v>

1181
00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:04.800
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty drunk.</v>

1182
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:08.280
<v Speaker 1>He's crazy and he's got the crazy gene </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1183
00:56:08.281 --> 00:56:13.281
<v Speaker 1>He's got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be a former heroin addict and </v>

1184
00:56:13.281 --> 00:56:13.281
<v Speaker 1>almost died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jean,</v>

1185
00:56:13.281 --> 00:56:16.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll only gets activated and people </v>

1186
00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:16.960
<v Speaker 1>that have been to the brink of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1187
00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I've met a bunch of people like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1188
00:56:17.851 --> 00:56:20.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something that happens.</v>

1189
00:56:20.901 --> 00:56:23.060
<v Speaker 1>There's some scary people like Matt </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown,</v>

1190
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 1>the guy who fights in the UFC,</v>

1191
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.840
<v Speaker 5>same kind of gene.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got that.</v>

1192
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.430
<v Speaker 5>I used to die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I died,</v>

1193
00:56:27.431 --> 00:56:28.300
<v Speaker 5>but I came back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jean,</v>

1194
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.950
<v Speaker 5>I met him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's really Nice Guy,</v>

1195
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:32.950
<v Speaker 5>a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's that edge of like,</v>

1196
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:38.070
<v Speaker 5>I think maybe they've been to the dark </v>
<v Speaker 5>lands when people have been to the dark </v>

1197
00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:39.040
<v Speaker 5>men's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they come back different.</v>

1198
00:56:39.041 --> 00:56:41.560
<v Speaker 5>So like Stephen King's pet cemetery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1199
00:56:41.561 --> 00:56:43.620
<v Speaker 5>you barely the cat comes back to life </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's like,</v>

1200
00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:45.250
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bring the cat back.</v>

1201
00:56:45.251 --> 00:56:47.290
<v Speaker 5>So fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't fuck with that cat.</v>

1202
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:51.020
<v Speaker 5>That is something that happens to people</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they've been to the darklands yeah.</v>

1203
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:52.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the listeria,</v>

1204
00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:56.710
<v Speaker 5>it's Arizona grows its own wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so all of our breads are from Arizona.</v>

1205
00:56:56.711 --> 00:56:57.280
<v Speaker 5>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1206
00:56:57.281 --> 00:56:58.120
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me ask you.</v>

1207
00:56:58.121 --> 00:56:58.530
<v Speaker 5>This.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is,</v>

1208
00:56:58.531 --> 00:57:00.520
<v Speaker 5>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you please not do that?</v>

1209
00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:02.530
<v Speaker 5>We're talking Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jimmy,</v>

1210
00:57:02.531 --> 00:57:04.150
<v Speaker 5>Phil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a new,</v>

1211
00:57:04.151 --> 00:57:07.660
<v Speaker 5>a Jimi Hendrix poster that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you notice in the background folks,</v>

1212
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:12.160
<v Speaker 5>because the old one was not really his </v>
<v Speaker 5>mugshot.</v>

1213
00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:16.060
<v Speaker 5>The new one is actually his mugshot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we had it swapped out.</v>

1214
00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:20.860
<v Speaker 5>This is the real Jimi Hendrix mugshot </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1215
00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:24.550
<v Speaker 5>Broke fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't worry about it folks.</v>

1216
00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:29.580
<v Speaker 5>We're going to be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it true about wheat that there are </v>

1217
00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:33.901
<v Speaker 5>strains that are wild or a rather </v>
<v Speaker 5>unmodified that are much more easy for </v>

1218
00:57:34.901 --> 00:57:38.530
<v Speaker 5>the body to digest?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Hayden Mills is one of the many,</v>

1219
00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:43.570
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>down in Phoenix that are actually </v>

1220
00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:43.570
<v Speaker 5>milling the local waste.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're looking,</v>

1221
00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:47.290
<v Speaker 5>they're basically cultivating a around </v>
<v Speaker 5>southern Arizona heirloom weight and </v>

1222
00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:49.780
<v Speaker 5>that's the idea they're going back to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1223
00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:55.080
<v Speaker 5>the problem with that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course it's always got to get the </v>

1224
00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.400
<v Speaker 5>give and take is that those heirloom </v>
<v Speaker 5>pure heirloom wheats to have far less </v>

1225
00:57:57.610 --> 00:58:00.460
<v Speaker 5>complex glutens and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1226
00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:03.820
<v Speaker 5>and there's far they don't produce as </v>
<v Speaker 5>much wheat,</v>

1227
00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.640
<v Speaker 5>so just your production on an acre of </v>
<v Speaker 5>land is,</v>

1228
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:10.210
<v Speaker 5>is significantly lower for this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's tastier,</v>

1229
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:11.740
<v Speaker 5>it has more nutrients.</v>

1230
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:18.240
<v Speaker 5>And then from there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the next step of course is people </v>

1231
00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.560
<v Speaker 5>understanding a time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're,</v>

1232
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:21.490
<v Speaker 5>you're taking that wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're mailing it,</v>

1233
00:58:21.491 --> 00:58:24.850
<v Speaker 5>and then when you go to make your bread,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any kind of fermentation in that,</v>

1234
00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:25.970
<v Speaker 5>that you're getting your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

1235
00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:29.830
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>inoculating that to make your bread,</v>

1236
00:58:30.550 --> 00:58:33.190
<v Speaker 5>that sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>letting this dose it overnight,</v>

1237
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:38.730
<v Speaker 5>you're letting it rise for a longer </v>
<v Speaker 5>period of time because that whole </v>

1238
00:58:38.801 --> 00:58:42.090
<v Speaker 5>process is breaking down those glutens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1239
00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:45.800
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So my sourdough bread is free.</v>

1240
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:49.060
<v Speaker 5>So because most commercial commercial </v>
<v Speaker 5>bread,</v>

1241
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:50.870
<v Speaker 5>the fermentation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1242
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:52.600
<v Speaker 5>the rising that doe is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

1243
00:58:52.890 --> 00:58:55.090
<v Speaker 5>is almost instantaneous and it goes </v>
<v Speaker 5>right into the oven.</v>

1244
00:58:55.091 --> 00:58:57.370
<v Speaker 5>And then people are not chewing their </v>
<v Speaker 5>food,</v>

1245
00:58:57.371 --> 00:59:02.371
<v Speaker 5>they're just cramming it in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's probably coming from places </v>

1246
00:59:02.371 --> 00:59:07.021
<v Speaker 5>that are doing a lot of pesticides and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the extra stuff that's going on </v>

1247
00:59:07.021 --> 00:59:07.270
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those crops.</v>

1248
00:59:07.271 --> 00:59:12.271
<v Speaker 5>So the heirloom wheat movement ends up </v>
<v Speaker 5>tying hand in hand in hand with,</v>

1249
00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:17.170
<v Speaker 5>with understanding the slow food </v>
<v Speaker 5>movement.</v>

1250
00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:19.510
<v Speaker 5>Take,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take your minute,</v>

1251
00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:25.020
<v Speaker 5>chew your food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>understanding where your food comes </v>

1252
00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:25.580
<v Speaker 5>from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>try to get it organic and local.</v>

1253
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:27.400
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it goes,</v>

1254
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:29.960
<v Speaker 5>that goes all the way back to the wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yes.</v>

1255
00:59:29.961 --> 00:59:31.340
<v Speaker 5>So there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So to answer your question,</v>

1256
00:59:31.341 --> 00:59:32.040
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1257
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:37.450
<v Speaker 5>what happened is they over world war one</v>
<v Speaker 5>to try and make sure that people are </v>

1258
00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:41.100
<v Speaker 5>going to be fed during those wars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were manipulating the wheat so that</v>

1259
00:59:41.101 --> 00:59:44.420
<v Speaker 5>it was much higher production weight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But now the flavor's gone.</v>

1260
00:59:44.421 --> 00:59:46.410
<v Speaker 5>The nutrition's not there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1261
00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:51.110
<v Speaker 5>it being resistant to all these things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that all the glutens are very complex.</v>

1262
00:59:51.111 --> 00:59:54.530
<v Speaker 5>And then so when you were actually big </v>
<v Speaker 5>and making the bread out of these things</v>

1263
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:59.090
<v Speaker 5>are making positives out of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just there's all this extra crap,</v>

1264
00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:04.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you created a Frankenstein's monster </v>

1265
01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:06.371
<v Speaker 5>with this wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So your body of course is reacting to </v>

1266
01:00:06.371 --> 01:00:09.191
<v Speaker 5>all those things that have nothing to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>with actually having bread or having </v>

1267
01:00:09.191 --> 01:00:09.191
<v Speaker 5>wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very controversial.</v>

1268
01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:14.420
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people try to claim that there </v>
<v Speaker 6>is no difference between the we'd have </v>

1269
01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:18.081
<v Speaker 6>today and the weight of the past and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they also try to claim that the only </v>

1270
01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:19.620
<v Speaker 6>people that have issues with gluten are </v>
<v Speaker 6>people that have gluten sensitivity,</v>

1271
01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.720
<v Speaker 6>celiac disease,</v>
<v Speaker 6>things along those lines.</v>

1272
01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:25.320
<v Speaker 6>And My,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my gripe with that is that I always feel</v>

1273
01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:28.770
<v Speaker 6>that the people that say that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>have a good sense of their body,</v>

1274
01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:32.430
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they're real athletes </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I think when you talk to a real.</v>

1275
01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:37.620
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying that you can't perform </v>
<v Speaker 6>like a real world class athlete by </v>

1276
01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:38.040
<v Speaker 6>eating pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You definitely can.</v>

1277
01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.670
<v Speaker 6>What I think is we want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 6>total optimization.</v>

1278
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:45.750
<v Speaker 6>If you want to talk about your body like</v>
<v Speaker 6>running as smoothly as possible.</v>

1279
01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:50.780
<v Speaker 6>For me at least,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I notice a difference between eating a </v>

1280
01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:54.531
<v Speaker 6>lot of bread and gluten,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I used to do a lot and not doing </v>

1281
01:00:54.531 --> 01:00:54.531
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

1282
01:00:54.531 --> 01:00:56.130
<v Speaker 6>When I don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just feel better.</v>

1283
01:00:56.131 --> 01:01:01.131
<v Speaker 6>I have more energy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like my body's struggles less </v>

1284
01:01:01.131 --> 01:01:02.520
<v Speaker 6>digestive food and I don't have the big </v>
<v Speaker 6>crash after the food is over.</v>

1285
01:01:02.610 --> 01:01:04.230
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't mean that I can't perform on </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

1286
01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.570
<v Speaker 6>Like I don't have a gluten sensitivity </v>
<v Speaker 6>issue.</v>

1287
01:01:06.571 --> 01:01:08.580
<v Speaker 6>Like I can eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not,</v>

1288
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:09.900
<v Speaker 6>that's not the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If someone said,</v>

1289
01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:10.590
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're fine,</v>

1290
01:01:10.591 --> 01:01:11.910
<v Speaker 6>you eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's no big deal.</v>

1291
01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.560
<v Speaker 6>It's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's no big deal.</v>

1292
01:01:13.561 --> 01:01:15.600
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's the optimal thing to </v>
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>

1293
01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:19.860
<v Speaker 6>I just think that it's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's killing me,</v>

1294
01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.750
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think if you want to give </v>
<v Speaker 6>your body the very best fuel pasta,</v>

1295
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:29.870
<v Speaker 6>like regular pasta isn't that fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I wonder if you can get some of that</v>

1296
01:01:30.451 --> 01:01:33.150
<v Speaker 6>heirloom pasta if you would notice a </v>
<v Speaker 6>difference.</v>

1297
01:01:33.151 --> 01:01:35.820
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if you would feel the </v>
<v Speaker 6>difference in trying the two.</v>

1298
01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.960
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So similar conversation parallel.</v>

1299
01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:41.880
<v Speaker 5>You're in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in Italy,</v>

1300
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:44.640
<v Speaker 5>you're having bottles of wine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're having gender.</v>

1301
01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:46.950
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it tastes great.</v>

1302
01:01:46.951 --> 01:01:48.720
<v Speaker 5>You had a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you woke up the next day,</v>

1303
01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.590
<v Speaker 5>he didn't have a hangover.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All those things over here.</v>

1304
01:01:52.591 --> 01:01:57.591
<v Speaker 5>I have wine and I get hangovers and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>get sick and I do those things and it's </v>

1305
01:01:57.591 --> 01:02:01.981
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it must be that the Italian wine is </v>

1306
01:02:01.981 --> 01:02:02.120
<v Speaker 5>better or has less sulfites or something</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that was like,</v>

1307
01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:05.250
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most likely what it was is over here.</v>

1308
01:02:05.251 --> 01:02:10.251
<v Speaker 5>You're a fat pig and you sat in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>house and you drank a bottle of wine </v>

1309
01:02:10.251 --> 01:02:14.511
<v Speaker 5>with your buddies without taking a walk </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a foreign country because you're </v>

1310
01:02:14.511 --> 01:02:18.861
<v Speaker 5>walking to your restaurant there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're having food and you're eating </v>

1311
01:02:18.861 --> 01:02:21.480
<v Speaker 5>over the course of three hours with your</v>
<v Speaker 5>friends and you're eating food with your</v>

1312
01:02:21.481 --> 01:02:23.340
<v Speaker 5>wine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're eating less of it.</v>

1313
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.520
<v Speaker 5>Most likely it has a lower alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 5>content because it's meant to go with </v>

1314
01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:32.181
<v Speaker 5>food rather than being this mountain dew</v>
<v Speaker 5>with alcohol in it that you get out of </v>

1315
01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:32.320
<v Speaker 5>California,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1316
01:02:32.321 --> 01:02:35.450
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all for one ones that I did not.</v>

1317
01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.950
<v Speaker 5>I did not all for California,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Arizona thing we're going on.</v>

1318
01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.850
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and maybe you're fucked.</v>

1319
01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:43.500
<v Speaker 5>You're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1320
01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:48.590
<v Speaker 5>Good to know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think there's an experiential thing</v>

1321
01:02:49.621 --> 01:02:54.621
<v Speaker 5>that's happening with those </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversations and it's the same thing </v>

1322
01:02:54.621 --> 01:02:55.830
<v Speaker 5>with the pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pasta makes me feel sluggish.</v>

1323
01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:58.170
<v Speaker 5>You eight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>17 pounds of it,</v>

1324
01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:00.810
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't eat 17 pounds of it,</v>

1325
01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:04.230
<v Speaker 5>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>going back to having just the initiation</v>

1326
01:03:04.231 --> 01:03:07.830
<v Speaker 5>of like understanding the conversation </v>
<v Speaker 5>of heirloom wheat and understanding that</v>

1327
01:03:07.831 --> 01:03:10.680
<v Speaker 5>there's a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Arguing that there is a difference.</v>

1328
01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:13.980
<v Speaker 5>Even if there isn't now you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 5>at it.</v>

1329
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:16.680
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you're having less of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you're,</v>

1330
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:21.710
<v Speaker 5>maybe you're portioning out better and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're paying attention to your diet </v>

1331
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.710
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1332
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:23.310
<v Speaker 5>that's a step in the right direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

1333
01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I read something about the French.</v>

1334
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:30.050
<v Speaker 6>The French are always eating bread,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they do have that older wheat bread </v>

1335
01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:31.580
<v Speaker 6>and they eat a lot of fats with their </v>
<v Speaker 6>bread,</v>

1336
01:03:31.581 --> 01:03:36.581
<v Speaker 6>like it's constantly with butter and oil</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they cook with a lot of butter and </v>

1337
01:03:36.581 --> 01:03:38.390
<v Speaker 6>oil in that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those carbs in that oil together.</v>

1338
01:03:38.391 --> 01:03:41.420
<v Speaker 6>Apparently it's just a better fit for </v>
<v Speaker 6>your digestive system.</v>

1339
01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.530
<v Speaker 5>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could see that.</v>

1340
01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:45.350
<v Speaker 5>I kind of did that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't stick to it.</v>

1341
01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:48.740
<v Speaker 5>Letter of the law,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I did a little bit of Kenogenic Diet</v>

1342
01:03:48.741 --> 01:03:50.870
<v Speaker 5>for a minute where I cut out sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>carbs,</v>

1343
01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:52.640
<v Speaker 5>all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just feel,</v>

1344
01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:56.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt a lot better a right away now.</v>

1345
01:03:56.810 --> 01:04:01.810
<v Speaker 5>Now I go back and I'll have some pasta </v>
<v Speaker 5>once or twice a month in small portions.</v>

1346
01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:05.120
<v Speaker 5>I'll have some bread,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't eat a lot of it.</v>

1347
01:04:05.121 --> 01:04:07.340
<v Speaker 5>I enjoy it better now more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not you.</v>

1348
01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:08.720
<v Speaker 5>It's a treat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a treat.</v>

1349
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:11.480
<v Speaker 5>It's enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that at that point like,</v>

1350
01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>proteins and vegetables are the staple </v>

1351
01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:17.840
<v Speaker 5>and I have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have treats now.</v>

1352
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel the exact same way.</v>

1353
01:04:19.591 --> 01:04:23.970
<v Speaker 6>I feel like I have my nutrition which is</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I try to eat really healthy food 80</v>

1354
01:04:23.971 --> 01:04:27.660
<v Speaker 6>percent of the time and then 20 percent </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the time I like to go to a restaurant</v>

1355
01:04:27.661 --> 01:04:29.340
<v Speaker 6>and get linguine with clams.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1356
01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:31.320
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just an experience.</v>

1357
01:04:31.321 --> 01:04:34.170
<v Speaker 6>It's a delicious experience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know it's not the best thing for me,</v>

1358
01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:35.250
<v Speaker 6>but it's a treat.</v>

1359
01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:35.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

1360
01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:36.950
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1361
01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.270
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get one life,</v>

1362
01:04:38.271 --> 01:04:39.080
<v Speaker 5>so let's enjoy it.</v>

1363
01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:40.480
<v Speaker 6>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially like what you're doing,</v>

1364
01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:42.580
<v Speaker 6>like having,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you have a restaurant,</v>

1365
01:04:42.581 --> 01:04:44.770
<v Speaker 6>I mean you're selling an experience,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1366
01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:48.760
<v Speaker 6>Like it's just delicious wines and </v>
<v Speaker 6>delicious foods.</v>

1367
01:04:48.761 --> 01:04:51.280
<v Speaker 6>And the two of them together with </v>
<v Speaker 6>conversation and saw that,</v>

1368
01:04:51.490 --> 01:04:52.030
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you're like,</v>

1369
01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:52.990
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>try this,</v>

1370
01:04:52.991 --> 01:04:53.500
<v Speaker 6>try this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1371
01:04:53.501 --> 01:04:58.501
<v Speaker 6>like when people are doing that and it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this whole sensory experience is </v>

1372
01:04:58.501 --> 01:04:59.860
<v Speaker 6>all combined together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not just about nutrition,</v>

1373
01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:03.880
<v Speaker 6>it's about the art of creating this </v>
<v Speaker 6>sensory experience.</v>

1374
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:06.260
<v Speaker 5>One could argue that your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your wellbeing,</v>

1375
01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you're actually increasing your life </v>

1377
01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:16.540
<v Speaker 5>experience here and your and your </v>
<v Speaker 5>quality of life by having this </v>

1378
01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 5>experience with these people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these wines that you</v>

1379
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.790
<v Speaker 1>actually feel better tomorrow and next </v>
<v Speaker 1>week because of that interaction because</v>

1380
01:05:21.791 --> 01:05:26.791
<v Speaker 1>of that short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though like that's straight butter </v>

1381
01:05:26.791 --> 01:05:26.791
<v Speaker 1>and that's straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1382
01:05:26.791 --> 01:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And wine.</v>

1383
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:29.560
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're 100 percent right.</v>

1384
01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of an overlooked aspect of </v>

1385
01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:36.400
<v Speaker 1>health is that positive experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1386
01:05:36.401 --> 01:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>and just also like when you go to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good restaurant and especially if</v>

1387
01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>you get to meet the cook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1388
01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>like you meet someone to cook something </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>

1389
01:05:43.781 --> 01:05:48.781
<v Speaker 1>you can say thank you and you have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>like cool feedback with the person who </v>

1390
01:05:48.781 --> 01:05:51.721
<v Speaker 1>made your food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's something going on </v>

1391
01:05:51.721 --> 01:05:51.721
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this exchange,</v>

1392
01:05:51.721 --> 01:05:52.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

1393
01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>it's like a sand castle and the way it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>

1394
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:58.570
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how the fucking the skill </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in creating it,</v>

1395
01:05:58.571 --> 01:06:00.230
<v Speaker 1>but then it's going to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1396
01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:00.940
<v Speaker 1>it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1397
01:06:00.941 --> 01:06:03.760
<v Speaker 1>it was a temporary experience and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this world of,</v>

1398
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:09.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the NSA stockpiling text messages and </v>

1399
01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Dick Pics and some fucking warehouse in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Utah,</v>

1400
01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lost it is,</v>

1401
01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:16.420
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got to address,</v>

1402
01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the address.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I known that I wouldn't give it out,</v>

1403
01:06:19.511 --> 01:06:24.511
<v Speaker 1>they'd come get me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come get you and tell you now we're </v>

1404
01:06:24.511 --> 01:06:25.900
<v Speaker 1>doubling down on your Dick Pics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got a fucking warehouse.</v>

1405
01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Gigantic like costco filled with </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly bigger warehouse but a bigger </v>

1406
01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.360
<v Speaker 1>fucking Irish.</v>

1407
01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1408
01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:40.870
<v Speaker 1>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in the concerts too,</v>

1409
01:06:40.871 --> 01:06:45.871
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like live concerts or kind of that way </v>

1410
01:06:45.871 --> 01:06:45.871
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1411
01:06:45.871 --> 01:06:48.631
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a temporary experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's one thing to listen to a </v>

1412
01:06:48.631 --> 01:06:51.991
<v Speaker 1>song that you have on your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can listen to it over and over </v>

1413
01:06:51.991 --> 01:06:54.121
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're going to see a live </v>

1414
01:06:54.121 --> 01:06:55.030
<v Speaker 1>concert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're experiencing the guy like onstage</v>

1415
01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:58.600
<v Speaker 1>sing that song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're experiencing the sound coming out</v>

1416
01:06:58.601 --> 01:06:59.860
<v Speaker 1>of the guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1417
01:06:59.861 --> 01:07:02.110
<v Speaker 1>When the guys touching the cords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why this.</v>

1418
01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:07.260
<v Speaker 1>That's why this stuff annoys me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The phones at the shows because I'm a </v>

1419
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.970
<v Speaker 1>firm believer in oral tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm a firm believer.</v>

1420
01:07:09.971 --> 01:07:13.120
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I embrace the storytelling.</v>

1421
01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I embraced that whole tradition of oral </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition and being able to describe to </v>

1422
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:20.530
<v Speaker 1>your friends that sitting around that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1423
01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:25.540
<v Speaker 1>fire after a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long day of hunting will you tell the </v>

1424
01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:28.861
<v Speaker 1>story of the hunt and do all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and those and those family </v>

1425
01:07:28.861 --> 01:07:28.861
<v Speaker 1>stories and other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1426
01:07:28.861 --> 01:07:33.780
<v Speaker 1>your grandfather and your great </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandfather's father's stories are told </v>

1427
01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:35.010
<v Speaker 1>in that setting and you have to remember</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's.</v>

1428
01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:36.530
<v Speaker 1>You're not reading it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1429
01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:39.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tradition of of understanding the</v>

1430
01:07:39.311 --> 01:07:44.311
<v Speaker 1>details of being able to explain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>expand on the details from what your </v>

1431
01:07:44.831 --> 01:07:49.831
<v Speaker 1>recollection of what you saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you have no skills of absorbing </v>

1432
01:07:49.831 --> 01:07:53.551
<v Speaker 1>what you saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you rely on this thing to capture </v>

1433
01:07:53.551 --> 01:07:54.280
<v Speaker 1>their stories for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1434
01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:59.310
<v Speaker 1>nothing you're going to get at a show is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be represented that represent </v>

1435
01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:00.610
<v Speaker 1>what you just saw or what you were there</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

1436
01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:03.790
<v Speaker 1>I guess as a postcard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it works,</v>

1437
01:08:03.791 --> 01:08:08.791
<v Speaker 1>but like it's not state presidents day </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these people to be there for this </v>

1438
01:08:10.451 --> 01:08:14.570
<v Speaker 1>thing that's far more important and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know also as critical.</v>

1439
01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the behind you would like</v>

1440
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.610
<v Speaker 5>to be that person who's willing to sell </v>
<v Speaker 5>that and now your shit's in their way.</v>

1441
01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:23.340
<v Speaker 6>Some people hold up fucking ipads.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's 12 inch ipad,</v>

1442
01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:26.490
<v Speaker 6>some dude at the laugh factory the other</v>
<v Speaker 6>day I had a fucking ipad.</v>

1443
01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:28.020
<v Speaker 6>The people behind you have to like,</v>

1444
01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:30.540
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're holding up an IPAD.</v>

1445
01:08:30.570 --> 01:08:33.060
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy to see everybody's got their </v>
<v Speaker 5>phone out.</v>

1446
01:08:33.061 --> 01:08:38.061
<v Speaker 5>So the first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that first barrier we talked about the </v>

1447
01:08:38.061 --> 01:08:41.691
<v Speaker 5>ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just getting past understanding how to </v>

1448
01:08:41.691 --> 01:08:44.030
<v Speaker 5>just get past not just what you think </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1449
01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all those things,</v>

1450
01:08:45.241 --> 01:08:46.530
<v Speaker 5>erasing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>erasing everything.</v>

1451
01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.900
<v Speaker 5>Think you now get past the ignorant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your own ignorance.</v>

1452
01:08:48.901 --> 01:08:49.710
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1453
01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:53.400
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but just then that situational awareness</v>

1454
01:08:53.401 --> 01:08:55.230
<v Speaker 5>is kind of goes in hand in hand with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1455
01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:58.260
<v Speaker 5>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only in your world,</v>

1456
01:08:58.261 --> 01:09:01.920
<v Speaker 5>but who are you in other people's world?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I'm driving my,</v>

1457
01:09:02.010 --> 01:09:05.370
<v Speaker 5>my primary mission is to get out of your</v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

1458
01:09:06.330 --> 01:09:08.280
<v Speaker 5>I want to get out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to get where I'm going.</v>

1459
01:09:08.281 --> 01:09:13.281
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to get out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to have you get out of my </v>

1460
01:09:13.281 --> 01:09:14.940
<v Speaker 5>way because I'm going to a place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm paying attention to where you are as</v>

1461
01:09:14.941 --> 01:09:15.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm driving.</v>

1462
01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:19.470
<v Speaker 5>Because if I think like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I think I'm in your way,</v>

1463
01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:22.410
<v Speaker 5>this is all gonna work out better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're all gonna.</v>

1464
01:09:22.411 --> 01:09:23.280
<v Speaker 5>We're all gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get along.</v>

1465
01:09:23.281 --> 01:09:25.710
<v Speaker 5>If you think like that on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I am in your way,</v>

1466
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:27.940
<v Speaker 5>let me figure out how I can make sure </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I'm,</v>

1467
01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.580
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting where I'm going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna put myself out.</v>

1468
01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:33.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure it's going to pull over the</v>
<v Speaker 5>side of the road while you all drive by.</v>

1469
01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:38.850
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to get out of the way so that </v>

1470
01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:39.240
<v Speaker 5>I make it convenient for you to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>where you're going as well.</v>

1471
01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.220
<v Speaker 5>We're all going someplace,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1472
01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:43.560
<v Speaker 5>We're in a car right away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's not.</v>

1473
01:09:43.830 --> 01:09:45.030
<v Speaker 5>Let's not fight here.</v>

1474
01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.110
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's not film ourselves driving either.</v>

1475
01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:52.140
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw someone facetiming while they're </v>

1476
01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:52.660
<v Speaker 6>driving and holding up the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>talking to someone I'm passing by.</v>

1477
01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:56.350
<v Speaker 6>I saw a dude doing candy crush awhile </v>
<v Speaker 6>back playing candy crush on his phone.</v>

1478
01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:58.970
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

1479
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:01.780
<v Speaker 5>People film,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fireworks.</v>

1480
01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:06.750
<v Speaker 5>Does anybody ever watch it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That makes no sense to me.</v>

1481
01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:08.200
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You send it,</v>

1482
01:10:08.201 --> 01:10:09.460
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You wouldn't believe the fireworks.</v>

1483
01:10:09.461 --> 01:10:11.320
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to send it to you to please </v>
<v Speaker 6>send it.</v>

1484
01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:15.340
<v Speaker 6>I can't wait to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wait to see the video of fireworks.</v>

1485
01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:20.670
<v Speaker 6>Can I put it on instagram?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you mind if I read Graham your </v>

1486
01:10:20.670 --> 01:10:21.850
<v Speaker 6>fireworks and brought it up?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd rather not.</v>

1487
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:24.040
<v Speaker 6>I'd really like all the hits.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a big,</v>

1488
01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:26.800
<v Speaker 6>big,</v>
<v Speaker 6>awful video.</v>

1489
01:10:26.801 --> 01:10:30.040
<v Speaker 6>The thought of Focus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't even tell what the fuck it is.</v>

1490
01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:33.430
<v Speaker 6>You see some lights flashing off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when you go to a fireworks display,</v>

1491
01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:36.730
<v Speaker 6>you see 50 fucking people holding up </v>
<v Speaker 6>their God damn phones.</v>

1492
01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:37.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are you doing?</v>

1493
01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:39.340
<v Speaker 6>What have you got?</v>

<v Speaker 5>it really does come down to </v>

1541

<v Speaker 5>there's things that I know that if a,</v>

1553
01:12:55.020 --> 01:13:00.020
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to put out a vinyl as a </v>

1554
01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:00.020
<v Speaker 5>band,</v>
<v Speaker 5>generally speaking,</v>

1555
01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:02.850
<v Speaker 5>unless you're somebody who can make some</v>
<v Speaker 5>calls and cut some corners,</v>

1556
01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:08.540
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to deliver a master to </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually cut vinyl and now as you want </v>

<v Speaker 5>you record comes out.</v>

1558
01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:13.950
<v Speaker 5>You don't want it to be a delayed thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>and have it all be scattered.</v>

1559
01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:19.580
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it takes three months that,</v>

1560
01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.960
<v Speaker 5>that's your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's your lead time for production.</v>

1561
01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:25.140
<v Speaker 5>No less than no less than three months </v>
<v Speaker 5>is what you have.</v>

1562
01:13:25.141 --> 01:13:27.030
<v Speaker 5>Like an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to make an order,</v>

1563
01:13:27.031 --> 01:13:32.031
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say like x amount of thousands that you </v>

1564
01:13:32.031 --> 01:13:32.031

<v Speaker 5>So you have to plan ahead.</v>

1565
01:13:32.031 --> 01:13:32.031
<v Speaker 5>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if the,</v>

1566

1573
01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:50.730

<v Speaker 5>That's not good.</v>

1574
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:55.760
<v Speaker 5>Nobody really uses a record on January </v>
<v Speaker 5>first just because it's a bad time to </v>

1575
01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:56.340
<v Speaker 5>release a record.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just came out of Christmas.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm having a rock concert on a New </v>
<v Speaker 5>Year's Eve.</v>

1579
01:14:04.591 --> 01:14:06.900
<v Speaker 5>That's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People that are out partying,</v>

1580
01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:11.960
<v Speaker 5>they're going to do their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're going to release a record in </v>

<v Speaker 5>the spring,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to release record in the </v>

1582
01:14:15.081 --> 01:14:15.081
<v Speaker 5>fall.</v>

1583
01:14:15.081 --> 01:14:15.081
<v Speaker 5>That's when you release it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Generally speaking,</v>

1584
01:14:15.081 --> 01:14:17.490
<v Speaker 5>people will release all summer as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the optimum times,</v>

1585
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.350
<v Speaker 5>our optimum times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So just knowing that,</v>

1586
01:14:20.351 --> 01:14:25.351
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well if it takes that long to produce </v>

1587
01:14:25.351 --> 01:14:25.351
<v Speaker 5>the record and get set up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>press and do interviews,</v>

1588
01:14:25.351 --> 01:14:30.001
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as for lead times in a magazine or </v>

1589
01:14:30.001 --> 01:14:30.001
<v Speaker 5>online where they've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1590
01:14:30.001 --> 01:14:34.620
<v Speaker 5>interviews are schedule that we had this</v>
<v Speaker 5>planned amongst go a couple of months </v>

1591
01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:35.410
<v Speaker 5>ago because I couldn't just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you couldn't,</v>

1592
01:14:35.411 --> 01:14:37.300
<v Speaker 5>you would just call me last week and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1593
01:14:37.301 --> 01:14:40.810
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna come in now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know what our schedules are.</v>

1594
01:14:40.811 --> 01:14:43.360
<v Speaker 5>So you're thinking ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1595
01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:45.820
<v Speaker 5>So same thing with the music,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're always,</v>

1596
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:47.470
<v Speaker 5>you're always kind of looking ahead to </v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

1597
01:14:47.471 --> 01:14:49.660
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in order to deliver that master,</v>

1598
01:14:49.661 --> 01:14:54.661
<v Speaker 5>that means we had to be mastering that </v>
<v Speaker 5>piece by here and we had to be mixing </v>

1599
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.360
<v Speaker 5>and mixing and then looking at the mixes</v>
<v Speaker 5>again and fixing anything.</v>

1600
01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:03.360
<v Speaker 5>It's meant to retract something and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of scrambling last minute before </v>

1601
01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:07.321
<v Speaker 5>mixing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's going to take this amount of </v>

1602
01:15:07.321 --> 01:15:07.321
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1603
01:15:07.321 --> 01:15:07.321
<v Speaker 5>in order to mix,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have to track,</v>

1604
01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:12.330
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you have to have everything written </v>

1605
01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:13.090
<v Speaker 5>before you can actually track it to mix </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1606
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:18.300
<v Speaker 5>generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that means all the songs have to be </v>

1607
01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:21.220
<v Speaker 5>written by this day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we're going to record all of them and</v>

1608
01:15:21.221 --> 01:15:25.030
<v Speaker 5>mix all of them and master all of them </v>
<v Speaker 5>and release them all on the same day.</v>

1609
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:26.620
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1610
01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:30.940
<v Speaker 5>so you have to think all the way back to</v>
<v Speaker 5>that day.</v>

1611
01:15:30.941 --> 01:15:32.020
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where are we today?</v>

1612
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:35.440
<v Speaker 5>Are Those songs finished today?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>

1613
01:15:35.441 --> 01:15:36.520
<v Speaker 5>Then we can start recording,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1614
01:15:36.521 --> 01:15:38.350
<v Speaker 5>tomorrow or next week?</v>

1615
01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.400
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do you know when a song is finished?</v>

1616
01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:42.170
<v Speaker 6>Like do you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you give yourself a deadline,</v>

1617
01:15:42.171 --> 01:15:43.390
<v Speaker 6>let's say if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1618
01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:48.460
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have six months to complete this </v>

1619
01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:48.460
<v Speaker 6>album or whatever it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you have a song that like,</v>

1620
01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.610
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just something about the songs.</v>

1621
01:15:49.611 --> 01:15:51.230
<v Speaker 6>This doesn't feel right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not done.</v>

1622
01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.450
<v Speaker 6>Just something feels off like how do </v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1623
01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:56.120
<v Speaker 6>how do you finish something by a </v>
<v Speaker 6>deadline?</v>

1624
01:15:57.250 --> 01:15:59.580
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes you don't,</v>

1625
01:16:00.170 --> 01:16:04.070
<v Speaker 6>so you just take it out of the album and</v>
<v Speaker 6>put it aside for later or how do you,</v>

1626
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:04.820
<v Speaker 6>how do you do that?</v>

1627
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:07.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>

1628
01:16:07.921 --> 01:16:10.080
<v Speaker 5>That varies with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1629
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:11.550
<v Speaker 5>if it's not ready,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not ready.</v>

1630
01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:13.800
<v Speaker 5>So you keep delaying and try to get it </v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1631
01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:18.920
<v Speaker 5>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you second guessing or you start </v>

1632
01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:18.920
<v Speaker 5>realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1633
01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:20.190
<v Speaker 5>these are just some things we should </v>
<v Speaker 5>just finish them.</v>

1634
01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:21.160
<v Speaker 5>Hm.</v>

1635
01:16:21.730 --> 01:16:22.040
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1636
01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:27.100
<v Speaker 6>remember that feeling when you were a </v>
<v Speaker 6>kid when you get an album and some of </v>

1637
01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.861
<v Speaker 6>the songs were just fucking amazing and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then you would hear like one or two or </v>

1638
01:16:29.861 --> 01:16:34.210
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is this piece of shit?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How did this get on a rolling stones </v>

1639
01:16:34.210 --> 01:16:38.021
<v Speaker 6>album?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that was likely because they had a </v>

1640
01:16:38.021 --> 01:16:38.021
<v Speaker 6>deadline and their record company made </v>
<v Speaker 6>them,</v>

1641
01:16:38.021 --> 01:16:38.610
<v Speaker 5>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1642
01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:43.620
<v Speaker 5>they were locked into a contract that </v>
<v Speaker 5>said that they had to deliver by a </v>

1643
01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:43.620
<v Speaker 5>certain time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1644
01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:44.920
<v Speaker 5>But if you're not locked into that kind </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a contract,</v>

1645
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:48.640
<v Speaker 5>then you can kind of take forever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is an equally awful thing</v>

1646
01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:50.250
<v Speaker 6>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Free of contracts.</v>

1647
01:16:50.251 --> 01:16:51.600
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are you your own man?</v>

1648
01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:53.760
<v Speaker 6>It comes to mutual.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Has One more time record</v>

1649
01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.740
<v Speaker 5>under a contract.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm perfect.</v>

1650
01:16:55.741 --> 01:16:57.810
<v Speaker 5>Circle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just signed up for a,</v>

1651
01:16:58.410 --> 01:17:01.080
<v Speaker 5>a one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a one album deal through a,</v>

1652
01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.370
<v Speaker 5>through a company.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1653
01:17:03.810 --> 01:17:08.810
<v Speaker 5>to do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one off album by post suffers an </v>

1654
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:12.591
<v Speaker 5>independent project.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've been independent from the </v>

1655
01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:14.441
<v Speaker 5>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So do you prefer that or is there </v>

1656
01:17:14.441 --> 01:17:17.561
<v Speaker 5>benefits to both?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's benefits to all those </v>

1657
01:17:17.561 --> 01:17:17.561
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Depends on,</v>

1658
01:17:17.561 --> 01:17:17.990
<v Speaker 5>it depends on how many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much,</v>

1659
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:23.020
<v Speaker 5>how many trust issues you have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess like if you're going to work </v>

1660
01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:25.421
<v Speaker 5>with a large company,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you can trust them to handle and </v>

1661
01:17:25.421 --> 01:17:28.871
<v Speaker 5>carry some of the water on some of these</v>
<v Speaker 5>things without getting lost or spilled </v>

1662
01:17:28.871 --> 01:17:29.540
<v Speaker 5>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dumped.</v>

1663
01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:30.950
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1664
01:17:30.951 --> 01:17:34.760
<v Speaker 5>You can work with a company like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It depends on your goals I suppose.</v>

1665
01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:37.800
<v Speaker 5>Is it like more of a benefit now that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you are.</v>

1666
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:39.150
<v Speaker 5>I mean especially,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1667
01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.930
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if now you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the resurgence of vinyl.</v>

1668
01:17:41.931 --> 01:17:44.300
<v Speaker 5>It's been pretty steady over the last </v>
<v Speaker 5>few years,</v>

1669
01:17:44.301 --> 01:17:45.260
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of like a,</v>

1670
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:50.030
<v Speaker 5>like a mason jar type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People in the old funky stuff,</v>

1671
01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:50.910
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1672
01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:55.980
<v Speaker 5>Well I think there's still that </v>
<v Speaker 5>nostalgic feel of touching the vinyl and</v>

1673
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:59.060
<v Speaker 5>then being able to have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have that thing and listened to it.</v>

1674
01:17:59.061 --> 01:18:04.061
<v Speaker 5>Then there is a difference,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I feel like going back to what you </v>

1675
01:18:04.061 --> 01:18:05.300
<v Speaker 5>had mentioned earlier about people </v>
<v Speaker 5>realizing,</v>

1676
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:10.360
<v Speaker 5>oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we need to start looking and </v>

1677
01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.091
<v Speaker 5>talking to each other again and </v>
<v Speaker 5>reconnecting and I feel like vinyl is </v>

1678
01:18:13.091 --> 01:18:16.610
<v Speaker 5>another tip of that iceberg of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>connection of like,</v>

1679
01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:21.850
<v Speaker 5>it's not long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's that this is so temporary and so </v>

1680
01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:22.220
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a one digital.</v>

1681
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:23.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So ditch,</v>

1682
01:18:23.001 --> 01:18:25.910
<v Speaker 5>so one emp away from all that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>being gone.</v>

1683
01:18:25.911 --> 01:18:27.920
<v Speaker 5>Your entire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all those experiences you wasted.</v>

1684
01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:32.920
<v Speaker 5>He were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were recording the fireworks rather </v>

1685
01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.880
<v Speaker 5>than actually looking at the fireworks </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you lost your job or your phone</v>

1686
01:18:34.881 --> 01:18:37.040
<v Speaker 5>in the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's gone.</v>

1687
01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:42.470
<v Speaker 5>Or an emp wipes out all of the servers </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are on your cloud.</v>

1688
01:18:42.471 --> 01:18:47.471
<v Speaker 5>And so all of those photos that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought were safe somewhere and no </v>

1689
01:18:47.471 --> 01:18:48.260
<v Speaker 5>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you freaked me out here.</v>

1690
01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:49.880
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah.</v>

1691
01:18:49.881 --> 01:18:50.650
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1692
01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:51.830
<v Speaker 5>I think vinyl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1693
01:18:51.831 --> 01:18:52.820
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a connection,</v>

1694
01:18:52.821 --> 01:18:55.250
<v Speaker 5>there's a tactal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does it sound better?</v>

1695
01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:56.960
<v Speaker 5>I think it does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1696
01:18:56.990 --> 01:19:00.140
<v Speaker 5>I think it does because it depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1697
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:01.460
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's the vinyl connection I think is </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of guys nowadays like tool</v>

1726
01:20:04.081 --> 01:20:05.070
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would just.</v>

1727
01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:10.520
<v Speaker 5>They'd like analog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like tracking to tape and to really </v>

1728
01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:14.691
<v Speaker 5>translate those things of vinyl is your </v>
<v Speaker 5>perfect medium for that thing.</v>

1729
01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:18.540
<v Speaker 5>It's just not very convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is no record stores.</v>

1730
01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:24.720
<v Speaker 5>When I released the first poster for </v>
<v Speaker 5>record in 2007 from the time we started </v>

1731
01:20:25.891 --> 01:20:28.350
<v Speaker 5>recording that record until the time we </v>
<v Speaker 5>released it,</v>

1732
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:33.830
<v Speaker 5>there was one number of stores when we </v>
<v Speaker 5>started the recording and there was one </v>

1733
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:37.461
<v Speaker 5>fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the number of stores actually in </v>

1734
01:20:37.461 --> 01:20:37.461
<v Speaker 5>existence by the time we actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>released it,</v>

1735
01:20:37.461 --> 01:20:42.430
<v Speaker 5>record industry stopped and went away </v>
<v Speaker 5>during that period of time,</v>

1736
01:20:42.810 --> 01:20:45.850
<v Speaker 5>so 2007 was when the wave rolled back </v>
<v Speaker 5>like you could see it happen.</v>

1737
01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:50.870
<v Speaker 5>It was gone and it was gone and that was</v>
<v Speaker 5>still with best buy's that we're still </v>

1738
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.870
<v Speaker 5>selling.</v>

1739
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:51.720
<v Speaker 5>Cds was still part of that one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twentieth.</v>

1740
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:53.640
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now this is all.</v>

1741
01:20:53.670 --> 01:20:57.900
<v Speaker 5>It's all rolled back to where the small </v>
<v Speaker 5>independent stores that weren't greedy,</v>

1742
01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:01.320
<v Speaker 5>that really had a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 5>their customers that enjoyed vinyl,</v>

1743
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:06.350
<v Speaker 5>that had all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are the ones that have survived </v>

1744
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360
<v Speaker 5>and thrived.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Amoeba.</v>

1745
01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:07.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1746
01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:12.680
<v Speaker 5>Those kind of much smaller versions of </v>
<v Speaker 5>those things like Zia records and the </v>

1747
01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:14.120
<v Speaker 5>Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1748
01:21:14.121 --> 01:21:19.121
<v Speaker 5>I've seen a few of those on the road and</v>
<v Speaker 5>have gotten into a bunch of them and </v>

1749
01:21:19.121 --> 01:21:19.560
<v Speaker 5>they're kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a totally different thing.</v>

1750
01:21:19.561 --> 01:21:21.200
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like you're going to an </v>
<v Speaker 5>antique store,</v>

1751
01:21:21.201 --> 01:21:23.700
<v Speaker 5>so I think we is great if you ever go </v>
<v Speaker 5>through stink weeds.</v>

1752
01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:25.190
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's that in,</v>

1753
01:21:25.191 --> 01:21:25.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in Arizona.</v>

1754
01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:26.520
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1755
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:31.550
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think tempy Kimberly's going to kill </v>

1756
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.550
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tempe.</v>

1757
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:33.030
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I couldn't remember what it was.</v>

1758
01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:35.010
<v Speaker 5>I just do the Tempe Improv all the time.</v>

1759
01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:36.420
<v Speaker 5>That's a cool little spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1760
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:39.240
<v Speaker 5>Tempe is interesting little town.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1761
01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:41.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That whole area is really awesome.</v>

1762
01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:42.670
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1763
01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:45.090
<v Speaker 5>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you make a run of those things,</v>

1764
01:21:45.091 --> 01:21:47.070
<v Speaker 5>you kind of have to decide like as </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're selling,</v>

1765
01:21:47.071 --> 01:21:48.900
<v Speaker 5>when to to make more of them too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1766
01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:49.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1767
01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:52.320
<v Speaker 5>as a small project like pushed for your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1768
01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:54.660
<v Speaker 5>we're writing the checks so you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to over,</v>

1769
01:21:55.020 --> 01:22:00.020
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to overproduce these </v>
<v Speaker 5>things because then you're kind of </v>

1770
01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:00.150
<v Speaker 5>sitting on them and for us at the level </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we're operating,</v>

1771
01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:04.080
<v Speaker 5>he always wanted to operate in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>level where it's sustainable.</v>

1772
01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:06.480
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's kind of a beat word.</v>

1773
01:22:06.481 --> 01:22:07.100
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1774
01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I use it all the time because this,</v>

1775
01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.540
<v Speaker 5>it's the most accurate word to really </v>
<v Speaker 5>look.</v>

1776
01:22:10.541 --> 01:22:11.130
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sustainable.</v>

1777
01:22:11.131 --> 01:22:13.200
<v Speaker 5>If I can keep this thing to keep this </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing alive,</v>

1778
01:22:13.530 --> 01:22:18.530
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to keep going back to other</v>
<v Speaker 5>pockets of money to make this thing led </v>

1779
01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:21.860
<v Speaker 5>to think should stand on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you have to be making all these </v>

1780
01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:23.700
<v Speaker 5>decisions as if this is an independent </v>
<v Speaker 5>business on its own.</v>

1781
01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:26.270
<v Speaker 5>Just ready to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so yeah,</v>

1782
01:22:26.271 --> 01:22:28.710
<v Speaker 5>you have to pay attention to if they </v>
<v Speaker 5>want.</v>

1783
01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.980
<v Speaker 5>If they want 10,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe nine.</v>

1784
01:22:34.290 --> 01:22:35.370
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1785
01:22:35.570 --> 01:22:37.950
<v Speaker 5>They 1:10</v>
<v Speaker 5>make night and keep people wanting more.</v>

1786
01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:40.910
<v Speaker 5>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Always told.</v>

1787
01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:46.600
<v Speaker 5>Don't live past means right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Step there in the goldilocks zone.</v>

1788
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:53.390
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you anticipate ever trimming it down </v>

1789
01:22:53.431 --> 01:22:56.310
<v Speaker 5>to one band or do you like working with </v>
<v Speaker 5>three different projects?</v>

1790
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:57.930
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think just the nature of,</v>

1791
01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:00.660
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of tool in general,</v>

1792
01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.190
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>jump into them,</v>

1793
01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:07.660
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>August one to use just their process in </v>

1794
01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:11.230
<v Speaker 5>their writing process is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is so drawn out.</v>

1795
01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:16.320
<v Speaker 5>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there's a lot of reasons that </v>

1796
01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.730
<v Speaker 5>go into why the delay has been so long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1797
01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:23.280
<v Speaker 5>but when you have a project like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's always going to be time for me </v>

1798
01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.420
<v Speaker 5>to do other things and I will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will definitely.</v>

1799
01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:28.540
<v Speaker 5>I just liked doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like doing it more.</v>

1800
01:23:28.541 --> 01:23:33.541
<v Speaker 5>I like to release records and write </v>
<v Speaker 5>things a little more quickly than those </v>

1801
01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:33.541
<v Speaker 5>guys like to write.</v>

1802
01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:37.710
<v Speaker 5>So their process is a very analytical </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think,</v>

1803
01:23:39.371 --> 01:23:41.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at some point maybe because so much time</v>

1804
01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:46.030
<v Speaker 5>has gone by with a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the last album,</v>

1805
01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:49.630
<v Speaker 5>there has to be some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little bit of fear in there,</v>

1806
01:23:49.631 --> 01:23:50.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in your gut,</v>

1807
01:23:50.351 --> 01:23:53.980
<v Speaker 5>like has or is this record going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>as good as the last one?</v>

1808
01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:54.790
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1809
01:23:54.791 --> 01:23:57.880
<v Speaker 5>the anticipation now is now the pressure</v>
<v Speaker 5>is huge,</v>

1810
01:23:57.881 --> 01:24:00.520
<v Speaker 5>so I'm sure there's some of that goes </v>
<v Speaker 5>into play,</v>

1811
01:24:01.090 --> 01:24:03.670
<v Speaker 5>but as far as the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1812
01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:05.350
<v Speaker 5>Danny and Adam and Justin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1813
01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:08.290
<v Speaker 5>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very tedious,</v>

1814
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:13.350
<v Speaker 5>a long process and they're always going </v>
<v Speaker 5>back over things and questioning what </v>

1815
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:16.090
<v Speaker 5>they did and stepping back and going </v>
<v Speaker 5>back farther and going forward.</v>

1816
01:24:16.530 --> 01:24:20.080
<v Speaker 5>And in a way it's like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're laying a foundation,</v>

1817
01:24:20.081 --> 01:24:21.730
<v Speaker 5>they're putting in the footings for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>

1818
01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:26.760
<v Speaker 5>So I can't write,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't write melodies until the </v>

1819
01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:26.760
<v Speaker 5>footings are in place.</v>

1820
01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:29.770
<v Speaker 5>I can't write words until the melodies </v>
<v Speaker 5>are in place.</v>

1821
01:24:29.771 --> 01:24:34.771
<v Speaker 5>So I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I can't build walls and then start </v>

1822
01:24:34.771 --> 01:24:36.840
<v Speaker 5>decorating this place until the </v>
<v Speaker 5>foundation is in place because if they </v>

1823
01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.260
<v Speaker 5>keep changing the foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>changing the footings,</v>

1824
01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:43.920
<v Speaker 5>the melodies change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the story of course isn't </v>

1825
01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:44.800
<v Speaker 5>getting written.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's where we are.</v>

1826
01:24:44.801 --> 01:24:49.801
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of footings that keep </v>

1827
01:24:49.801 --> 01:24:49.801
<v Speaker 5>shifting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lots of awesome footings,</v>

1828
01:24:49.801 --> 01:24:52.180
<v Speaker 5>but they keep changing so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they keep changing their minds.</v>

1829
01:24:52.330 --> 01:24:54.310
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know if it's a good thing or </v>
<v Speaker 5>a bad thing,</v>

1830
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:55.930
<v Speaker 5>it's just their process.</v>

1831
01:24:56.210 --> 01:25:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Is this a challenge for you to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>manage your own personal expectations </v>

1832
01:25:01.210 --> 01:25:05.831
<v Speaker 1>with the work of others and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know you're so you're very </v>

1833
01:25:05.831 --> 01:25:08.771
<v Speaker 1>prolific and you're a guy that just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very disciplined so you always </v>

1834
01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:11.921
<v Speaker 1>grinding and then when you manage those </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations and you're dealing with a </v>

1835
01:25:11.921 --> 01:25:14.660
<v Speaker 1>bunch of other artists and you're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>converging together,</v>

1836
01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:17.900
<v Speaker 1>converging together on this project </v>
<v Speaker 1>combined cannot make a word up.</v>

1837
01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:20.060
<v Speaker 1>I think it just made it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1838
01:25:20.061 --> 01:25:20.570
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1839
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:22.430
<v Speaker 1>when you have a lot of very strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>willed,</v>

1840
01:25:22.431 --> 01:25:27.431
<v Speaker 1>stubborn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinionated people that have had </v>

1841
01:25:27.431 --> 01:25:27.431
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself included,</v>

1842
01:25:27.431 --> 01:25:29.510
<v Speaker 1>like when you give somebody some </v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

1843
01:25:29.511 --> 01:25:31.220
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty convinced they're right,</v>

1844
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:32.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1845
01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:38.200
<v Speaker 1>so it's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to talk to me or it's hard to </v>

1846
01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.481
<v Speaker 1>talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to talk to people that are in </v>

1847
01:25:40.481 --> 01:25:40.481
<v Speaker 1>that position because they've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

1848
01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:42.590
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so you're,</v>

1849
01:25:42.650 --> 01:25:47.650
<v Speaker 5>you think that the reason you got there </v>
<v Speaker 5>is because of whatever position it is </v>

1850
01:25:47.650 --> 01:25:49.850
<v Speaker 5>you're taking today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is fine.</v>

1851
01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:51.040
<v Speaker 5>But our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1852
01:25:51.041 --> 01:25:54.980
<v Speaker 5>our process has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has evolved over the years,</v>

1853
01:25:55.210 --> 01:25:58.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that,</v>

1854
01:25:58.821 --> 01:26:00.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that stubborn nature,</v>

1855
01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:05.740
<v Speaker 5>he try yet again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take step back and not take any,</v>

1856
01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.790
<v Speaker 5>any of these things personally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1857
01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:10.550
<v Speaker 5>that's our tendency is to like what is </v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1858
01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:11.910
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you get that way.</v>

1860
01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.560
<v Speaker 5>Familiarity breeds contempt kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1861
01:26:15.650 --> 01:26:20.650
<v Speaker 6>How much of a problem is expectations of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fans because the fans like want new </v>

1862

<v Speaker 5>20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But without social media and without </v>

<v Speaker 5>that direct access of bitching,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

1870
01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:44.380
<v Speaker 5>It's like again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go to a master,</v>

1871
01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:48.370

1877
01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:07.850

<v Speaker 6>Lube when you're sitting there and </v>

1878
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:12.230

1907
01:28:08.321 --> 01:28:13.321
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wrote a book and you're just </v>

1908
01:28:13.321 --> 01:28:16.411
<v Speaker 6>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fascinating because you're also </v>

1909
01:28:16.411 --> 01:28:19.950
<v Speaker 6>pretty at peace,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you've found like this strange </v>

1910
01:28:19.950 --> 01:28:22.680
<v Speaker 6>balance of activity and then also </v>
<v Speaker 6>relative isolation and your small area </v>

1911
01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:24.100
<v Speaker 6>took</v>

1912
01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:25.610
<v Speaker 5>me awhile to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1913
01:28:25.630 --> 01:28:27.750
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my desire to move forward with go,</v>

1914
01:28:27.751 --> 01:28:29.860
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go and get things done.</v>

1915
01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:34.880
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm always butting heads heads with and </v>

1916
01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:36.060
<v Speaker 5>the guys in the band and tool to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>those things done and just,</v>

1917
01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:40.450
<v Speaker 5>it's just not their process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it took me a while for me to go,</v>

1918
01:28:40.451 --> 01:28:41.960
<v Speaker 5>this is not personal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is just them.</v>

1919
01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:45.550
<v Speaker 5>This is just the way that they have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do it and I have to respect it.</v>

1920
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:50.470
<v Speaker 5>And I had to take my time and let them </v>
<v Speaker 5>take their time and I just check in.</v>

1921
01:28:50.650 --> 01:28:52.720
<v Speaker 5>I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I come and I see what's going on.</v>

1922
01:28:52.721 --> 01:28:54.400
<v Speaker 5>Hey Justin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1923
01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:57.640
<v Speaker 5>some may send me the track,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see where we're at,</v>

1924
01:28:57.970 --> 01:29:02.970
<v Speaker 5>is this thing done?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If this thing is done done and I can </v>

1925
01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:04.830
<v Speaker 5>start writing words and music on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

1926
01:29:04.831 --> 01:29:08.670
<v Speaker 5>But I've had instances where I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>started to write stuff and by the time I</v>

1927
01:29:08.671 --> 01:29:11.160
<v Speaker 5>actually got it around and back and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're at last,</v>

1928
01:29:11.161 --> 01:29:16.161
<v Speaker 5>she listening and whatever the Ta had </v>
<v Speaker 5>gone in a completely different </v>

1929
01:29:16.261 --> 01:29:16.830
<v Speaker 5>direction.</v>

1930
01:29:17.190 --> 01:29:22.190
<v Speaker 5>So everything that was written melody </v>
<v Speaker 5>wise or lyric wise was completely </v>

1931
01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:22.230
<v Speaker 5>irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I have to start over.</v>

1932
01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:24.570
<v Speaker 5>Is that weird because you guys aren't in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same location.</v>

1933
01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:29.580
<v Speaker 5>Physically I can sit there in that room </v>
<v Speaker 5>a and be with them in that room,</v>

1934
01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:35.140
<v Speaker 5>but their process is so tedious and so </v>
<v Speaker 5>like rain man.</v>

1935
01:29:35.650 --> 01:29:40.650
<v Speaker 5>Then I just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just started fucking folding in on </v>

1936
01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:40.650
<v Speaker 5>myself like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1937
01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:41.550
<v Speaker 5>right back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gotta go make Pasta.</v>

1938
01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:47.460
<v Speaker 5>I got to be right back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gotta go take five years to plant a </v>

1939
01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.290
<v Speaker 5>vineyard because the old still be right </v>
<v Speaker 5>where you were when I left.</v>

1940
01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:51.000
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

1941
01:29:51.090 --> 01:29:53.580
<v Speaker 5>it's a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What they're doing is a wonderful.</v>

1942
01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:57.660
<v Speaker 5>I completely back what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1943
01:29:58.100 --> 01:30:03.100
<v Speaker 5>no another way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no other way for them to do it </v>

1944
01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:03.100
<v Speaker 5>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

1945
01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:04.380
<v Speaker 5>I can move much more quickly if you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you'll let me help you.</v>

1946
01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:05.190
<v Speaker 5>I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1947
01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:07.020
<v Speaker 5>I've written a few songs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

1948
01:30:07.021 --> 01:30:09.370
<v Speaker 5>I was involved in many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1949
01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:12.000
<v Speaker 5>the ones that we've done so we could do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1950
01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:16.110
<v Speaker 5>but I think this is what the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is what they need to do.</v>

1951
01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.280
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm,</v>

1952
01:30:18.281 --> 01:30:19.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm okay with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1953
01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:24.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to get a little friction and </v>

1954
01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:24.200
<v Speaker 5>they're set to come in and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1955
01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.030
<v Speaker 5>and puff my chest out a little bit and </v>
<v Speaker 5>be aggressive and let's,</v>

1956
01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:26.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>

1957
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:28.200
<v Speaker 5>let's move guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's move it.</v>

1958
01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:30.660
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that worked for a minute,</v>

1959
01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:31.740
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we,</v>

1960
01:30:31.770 --> 01:30:34.650
<v Speaker 5>we definitely make traction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if I were to do that every day,</v>

1961
01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:37.350
<v Speaker 5>it would just become a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>friction,</v>

1962
01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:40.820
<v Speaker 5>more friction rather than actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting anything done.</v>

1963
01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:42.540
<v Speaker 5>Seems like one of the biggest problems </v>
<v Speaker 5>with bands,</v>

1964
01:30:42.541 --> 01:30:47.541
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just getting into personalities </v>

1965
01:30:47.541 --> 01:30:47.541
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1966
01:30:47.541 --> 01:30:47.541
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1967
01:30:47.541 --> 01:30:47.541
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1968
01:30:47.541 --> 01:30:49.080
<v Speaker 5>We're definitely very strong for very </v>
<v Speaker 5>strong personalities.</v>

1969
01:30:49.650 --> 01:30:51.150
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1970
01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:54.600
<v Speaker 5>same with billy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>working with billy with perfect circle,</v>

1971
01:30:55.380 --> 01:31:00.380
<v Speaker 5>he gets a little forest for trees </v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes and I'm like the guy gone </v>

1972
01:31:00.630 --> 01:31:02.370
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>step back,</v>

1973
01:31:02.670 --> 01:31:04.350
<v Speaker 5>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1974
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:07.060
<v Speaker 5>and then I'm out the door for poor guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go home.</v>

1975
01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:07.650
<v Speaker 5>Where'd you go?</v>

1976
01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:11.060
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>

1977
01:31:11.070 --> 01:31:16.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>working with Matt Mitchell and Corina </v>

1978
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.070
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and put suffer.</v>

1979
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:21.020
<v Speaker 5>We all generally work with or for other </v>
<v Speaker 5>projects and other people.</v>

1980
01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:26.250
<v Speaker 5>So when we get together we are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>streamline organized.</v>

1981
01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:28.020
<v Speaker 5>We go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1982
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:30.690
<v Speaker 5>I'll check in with the guys and tool and</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

1983
01:31:30.691 --> 01:31:31.530
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where are we at?</v>

1984
01:31:31.531 --> 01:31:33.360
<v Speaker 5>What do we got?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are we there?</v>

1985
01:31:33.390 --> 01:31:34.980
<v Speaker 5>Is it like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are we going to track tomorrow?</v>

1986
01:31:35.010 --> 01:31:37.680
<v Speaker 5>Because we're going to track tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you.</v>

1987
01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:39.600
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then this is,</v>

1988
01:31:39.690 --> 01:31:42.330
<v Speaker 5>we're going to line this up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if we're not going to track tomorrow</v>

1989
01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:47.990
<v Speaker 5>and it's going to take this much time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well then I'm going to do this other </v>

1990
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:49.950
<v Speaker 5>thing while we're telling me when that </v>
<v Speaker 5>day is,</v>

1991
01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:52.500
<v Speaker 5>when we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we're ready to start,</v>

1992
01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:55.140
<v Speaker 5>when these are done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can take my time to write.</v>

1993
01:31:55.190 --> 01:31:57.420
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1994
01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:03.020
<v Speaker 5>in fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should take my 10 years to write </v>

1995
01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:03.020
<v Speaker 5>lyrics now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I won't do that,</v>

1996
01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:06.160
<v Speaker 5>but I'll hold,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll digest these things as quickly as I</v>

1997
01:32:06.161 --> 01:32:08.410
<v Speaker 5>can and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and keep that moment,</v>

1998
01:32:08.411 --> 01:32:13.411
<v Speaker 5>that freshness of what my impressions </v>
<v Speaker 5>are of the finished tracks and we'll </v>

1999
01:32:13.411 --> 01:32:13.411
<v Speaker 5>start,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but nothing,</v>

2000
01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:15.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing is tracked yet.</v>

2001
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:21.000
<v Speaker 5>Nothing is completely finished as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of songs that I think are </v>

2002
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:21.000
<v Speaker 5>finished now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can start working on those,</v>

2003
01:32:21.650 --> 01:32:24.900
<v Speaker 5>but nothing's actually recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's just all for.</v>

2004
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:27.230
<v Speaker 5>They're just written.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2005
01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:30.250
<v Speaker 5>so that leaves time so I can actually go</v>
<v Speaker 5>and work with,</v>

2006
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:31.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with billy.</v>

2007
01:32:31.391 --> 01:32:32.680
<v Speaker 5>I can work with Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Corrina,</v>

2008
01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:34.470
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2009
01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:36.160
<v Speaker 5>and get other things done in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>interim.</v>

2010
01:32:36.161 --> 01:32:38.020
<v Speaker 5>So there's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's more.</v>

2011
01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:39.970
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you write something like say if you</v>

2012
01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:41.470
<v Speaker 6>have an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're just sitting around you like,</v>

2013
01:32:41.471 --> 01:32:44.620
<v Speaker 6>I have a thought,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you just sit down and you go,</v>

2014
01:32:44.621 --> 01:32:45.850
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a tool song.</v>

2015
01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:48.550
<v Speaker 6>This is a perfect circle song.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a pushover song.</v>

2016
01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:49.240
<v Speaker 6>Does it just like,</v>

2017
01:32:49.850 --> 01:32:50.720
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because what I'm,</v>

2018
01:32:50.721 --> 01:32:54.950
<v Speaker 5>what I'm writing to is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the music that I'm hearing from those</v>

2019
01:32:54.951 --> 01:32:56.840
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's all you write too.</v>

2020
01:32:56.841 --> 01:32:59.090
<v Speaker 5>I write to the music because that way </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a unique,</v>

2021
01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:01.100
<v Speaker 5>it's a unique island situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those,</v>

2022
01:33:01.130 --> 01:33:03.140
<v Speaker 5>those things are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whenever I've tried to write,</v>

2023
01:33:03.170 --> 01:33:08.170
<v Speaker 5>I've had some poetry sitting over here </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I want to write and I tried to </v>

2024
01:33:08.170 --> 01:33:11.960
<v Speaker 5>force it onto a song for any of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>projects.</v>

2025
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:13.790
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't,</v>

2026
01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:15.230
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't seem to fit.</v>

2027
01:33:16.010 --> 01:33:21.010
<v Speaker 5>So you need to hear the song,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to hear the finished thing for </v>

2028
01:33:21.010 --> 01:33:22.280
<v Speaker 5>almost finished thing and then put </v>
<v Speaker 5>lyrics to it.</v>

2029
01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:23.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2030
01:33:23.570 --> 01:33:25.340
<v Speaker 5>Get them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get the melodies in place,</v>

2031
01:33:25.341 --> 01:33:26.990
<v Speaker 5>get the rhythm is as if I'm an </v>
<v Speaker 5>instrument.</v>

2032
01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:29.120
<v Speaker 5>And that how you guys did that Fibonacci</v>
<v Speaker 5>Song?</v>

2033
01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:30.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2034
01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:31.730
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2035
01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.730
<v Speaker 5>That was a really unique undertaking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How,</v>

2036
01:33:34.731 --> 01:33:36.230
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what was the process behind that?</v>

2037
01:33:36.230 --> 01:33:38.000
<v Speaker 5>Like did you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did you say hey,</v>

2038
01:33:38.150 --> 01:33:41.870
<v Speaker 5>it would be a nifty idea and do </v>
<v Speaker 5>something to a mathematical sequence?</v>

2039
01:33:41.871 --> 01:33:42.710
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2040
01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:44.450
<v Speaker 5>that was a complete accident.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2041
01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:49.580
<v Speaker 5>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was Adam or justin who had </v>

2042
01:33:49.581 --> 01:33:52.250
<v Speaker 5>the riff and at some point they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually counting,</v>

2043
01:33:53.210 --> 01:33:56.090
<v Speaker 5>counting the riff and it ended up being </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a seven,</v>

2044
01:33:56.091 --> 01:33:56.600
<v Speaker 5>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nine.</v>

2045
01:33:56.601 --> 01:34:01.601
<v Speaker 5>I think it was like a measure of seven,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a measure of a measure of nine and I'm </v>

2046
01:34:01.601 --> 01:34:06.191
<v Speaker 5>not sure how you would actually write </v>
<v Speaker 5>that out as a and no notation,</v>

2047
01:34:06.861 --> 01:34:07.730
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2048
01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:12.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think seven 89 is of FIBONACCI number.</v>

2049
01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm just that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2050
01:34:16.130 --> 01:34:18.800
<v Speaker 5>the actual seminar and 89 I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

2051
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:19.850
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to look at again,</v>

2052
01:34:19.851 --> 01:34:21.670
<v Speaker 5>it might be nine 87.</v>

2053
01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:23.000
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the fuck we're talking</v>

2054
01:34:23.001 --> 01:34:27.230
<v Speaker 6>about FIBONACCI sequences,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a very unique mathematical sequence that</v>

2055
01:34:27.231 --> 01:34:28.820
<v Speaker 6>appears in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

2056
01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:32.060
<v Speaker 6>it's in fractals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's in sunflowers.</v>

2057
01:34:32.061 --> 01:34:34.220
<v Speaker 6>If you look at the pattern of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>sunflower seeds,</v>

2058
01:34:34.221 --> 01:34:36.650
<v Speaker 6>if you look at nautilus shells and what </v>
<v Speaker 6>it is,</v>

2059
01:34:36.651 --> 01:34:41.180
<v Speaker 6>it's an expanding fractal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of a mathematical equation.</v>

2060
01:34:41.181 --> 01:34:44.530
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if I'm saying it correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's like the first step is zero and</v>

2061
01:34:44.531 --> 01:34:48.950
<v Speaker 6>then there's one and then there's one to</v>
<v Speaker 6>two posts.</v>

2062
01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:50.690
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it just keeps going on.</v>

2063
01:34:50.691 --> 01:34:52.970
<v Speaker 6>So that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the FIBONACCI number,</v>

2064
01:34:53.290 --> 01:34:54.260
<v Speaker 6>a whole number,</v>

2065
01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:59.680
<v Speaker 5>like actual number sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's the fire ratio.</v>

2066
01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:01.280
<v Speaker 5>One point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one point six,</v>

2067
01:35:01.281 --> 01:35:03.500
<v Speaker 5>one eight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything multiplied by the one point six</v>

2068
01:35:03.501 --> 01:35:05.060
<v Speaker 5>minute that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are not,</v>

2069
01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:07.460
<v Speaker 5>not multiplied.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The relationship,</v>

2070
01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:09.380
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the difference,</v>

2071
01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:13.580
<v Speaker 5>the difference in the length from this </v>
<v Speaker 5>finger,</v>

2072
01:35:13.610 --> 01:35:15.840
<v Speaker 5>this finger as opposed to this finger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that finger,</v>

2073
01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:16.090
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>

2074
01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:20.210
<v Speaker 5>those knuckles and your digits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are all in that,</v>

2075
01:35:20.330 --> 01:35:22.670
<v Speaker 5>in that relationship of one point six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one eight.</v>

2076
01:35:22.671 --> 01:35:26.480
<v Speaker 5>The fire relationships so that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fractals as it's,</v>

2077
01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:29.480
<v Speaker 5>as it's growing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that progression is,</v>

2078
01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:30.740
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>

2079
01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:33.410
<v Speaker 5>is that ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the number breakdown is,</v>

2080
01:35:33.411 --> 01:35:34.580
<v Speaker 5>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one,</v>

2081
01:35:34.581 --> 01:35:35.540
<v Speaker 5>one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two,</v>

2082
01:35:35.690 --> 01:35:36.440
<v Speaker 5>three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>

2083
01:35:36.441 --> 01:35:37.250
<v Speaker 5>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>13.</v>

2084
01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:37.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

2085
01:35:37.821 --> 01:35:41.400
<v Speaker 3>So like one plus one is two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two plus one is three,</v>

2086
01:35:41.401 --> 01:35:43.590
<v Speaker 3>three plus two is five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five plus three is eight.</v>

2087
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:46.050
<v Speaker 3>And it's like everything you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you count,</v>

2088
01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.770
<v Speaker 3>you add what came before it ended a </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiral,</v>

2089
01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.780
<v Speaker 3>a picture of like of a Giza plateau </v>
<v Speaker 3>showing you them.</v>

2090
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:55.200
<v Speaker 3>Well also facial structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really fascinating.</v>

2091
01:35:55.560 --> 01:36:00.560
<v Speaker 3>There's something about human facial </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure that uses the FIBONACCI </v>

2092
01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:04.791
<v Speaker 3>sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I read somewhere about why people </v>

2093
01:36:04.791 --> 01:36:06.000
<v Speaker 3>recognize plastic surgery while it </v>
<v Speaker 3>disturbs them.</v>

2094
01:36:06.150 --> 01:36:07.020
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2095
01:36:07.021 --> 01:36:08.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like what's going on with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sequence?</v>

2096
01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:10.860
<v Speaker 3>The sequence is off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my friend.</v>

2097
01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it is,</v>

2098
01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.610
<v Speaker 3>the FIBONACCI relationships of the human</v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

2099
01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:16.950
<v Speaker 3>And then all A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend who said,</v>

2100
01:36:16.951 --> 01:36:18.990
<v Speaker 3>you know how when you know a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2101
01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.180
<v Speaker 3>a family has had a child</v>

2102
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:23.040
<v Speaker 5>who has down's syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2103
01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:26.870
<v Speaker 5>There's does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it crosses racial divides.</v>

2104
01:36:26.871 --> 01:36:28.300
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can tell this.</v>

2105
01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:31.590
<v Speaker 5>This family has had that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that child has down syndrome.</v>

2106
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:33.360
<v Speaker 5>There was a look that goes along with </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2107
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:35.460
<v Speaker 5>He said if the same look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2108
01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:36.670
<v Speaker 5>not the same look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

2109
01:36:36.990 --> 01:36:41.940
<v Speaker 5>it's the same recognition of people who </v>
<v Speaker 5>have had a facial plastic</v>

2110
01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:47.050
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You recognize you're not fooling </v>

2111
01:36:47.050 --> 01:36:47.050
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are,</v>

2112
01:36:47.050 --> 01:36:49.430
<v Speaker 3>you've done a thing that's recognizable </v>
<v Speaker 3>universally as wrong.</v>

2113
01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:52.040
<v Speaker 3>Something's wrong with your son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't off.</v>

2114
01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's off.</v>

2115
01:36:53.110 --> 01:36:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I thought he was</v>

2116
01:36:54.490 --> 01:36:56.920
<v Speaker 5>funny that he was actually connecting it</v>
<v Speaker 5>to doubt.</v>

2117
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:58.870
<v Speaker 5>No disrespect to people with down </v>
<v Speaker 5>syndrome.</v>

2118
01:36:58.871 --> 01:36:59.930
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

2119
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:01.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying.</v>

2120
01:37:01.221 --> 01:37:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2121
01:37:01.581 --> 01:37:06.581
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like when you see someone with </v>

2122
01:37:06.581 --> 01:37:06.581
<v Speaker 3>a disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Oh,</v>

2123
01:37:06.581 --> 01:37:06.980
<v Speaker 3>there's clearly an error here in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>code.</v>

2124
01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:08.700
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2125
01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:10.630
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the facial reconstruction,</v>

2126
01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.950
<v Speaker 3>like the plastic surgery because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2127
01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:13.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2128
01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:18.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just have them hold the nose thing </v>

2129
01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:21.701
<v Speaker 3>too is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when someone has a uniquely small </v>

2130
01:37:21.701 --> 01:37:22.940
<v Speaker 3>nose and their face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might have like a long,</v>

2131
01:37:22.941 --> 01:37:27.941
<v Speaker 3>like Ari Shaffir type face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then they have this like shrunken </v>

2132
01:37:27.941 --> 01:37:29.300
<v Speaker 3>down knows you're like hey yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this seems fucked.</v>

2133
01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:30.420
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't.</v>

2134
01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:33.650
<v Speaker 3>There's a ratio that supposed to exist </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't exist.</v>

2135
01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:35.980
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a,</v>

2136
01:37:35.981 --> 01:37:37.040
<v Speaker 5>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a,</v>

2137
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:41.040
<v Speaker 5>in a way a song like a lottery with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>FIBONACCI thing that's,</v>

2138
01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:46.180
<v Speaker 5>that's I feel like I kind of pulled a </v>
<v Speaker 5>very pedestrian sophomore move by </v>

2139
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:54.310
<v Speaker 5>including those numbers in there because</v>
<v Speaker 5>in general music is the fire ratio.</v>

2140
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:57.660
<v Speaker 5>Everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything that all nature,</v>

2141
01:37:57.661 --> 01:37:58.980
<v Speaker 5>all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about it.</v>

2142
01:37:58.981 --> 01:38:02.130
<v Speaker 5>It's already here by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by pointing it out,</v>

2143
01:38:02.131 --> 01:38:06.610
<v Speaker 5>like staring at it and pointing at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>With those numbers are present and the,</v>

2144
01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:09.210
<v Speaker 5>and the way that the numbers and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>lyrics are,</v>

2145
01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:10.860
<v Speaker 5>I feel like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2146
01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:14.640
<v Speaker 5>it's good to let people know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I almost feel like it was kind of a,</v>

2147
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:17.700
<v Speaker 5>it was kind of a Dick joke in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2148
01:38:18.570 --> 01:38:19.260
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2149
01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:22.110
<v Speaker 5>I could do better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>

2150
01:38:22.590 --> 01:38:24.900
<v Speaker 5>Are you one of those ruthlessly </v>
<v Speaker 5>introspective guys?</v>

2151
01:38:24.901 --> 01:38:25.980
<v Speaker 5>Just choose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2152
01:38:25.981 --> 01:38:28.780
<v Speaker 5>Probably so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anybody's name</v>

2153
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:30.090
<v Speaker 1>good at anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that.</v>

2154
01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:33.180
<v Speaker 1>No other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good thing.</v>

2155
01:38:33.450 --> 01:38:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good at anything.</v>

2156
01:38:34.650 --> 01:38:37.080
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you have a guard dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you turn on yourself.</v>

2157
01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sit.</v>

2158
01:38:40.410 --> 01:38:41.930
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2159
01:38:41.931 --> 01:38:43.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like figuring out what's wrong with me.</v>

2160
01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Get me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get me.</v>

2161
01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:46.410
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2162
01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:47.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fly.</v>

2163
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:50.580
<v Speaker 1>You're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm my own guard dog.</v>

2164
01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:55.880
<v Speaker 1>One shot to the dome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I break the God I punched through the </v>

2165
01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.840
<v Speaker 1>guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My shots go through your God.</v>

2166
01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Keep your hands up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2167
01:39:00.961 --> 01:39:04.440
<v Speaker 1>That's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucked.</v>

2168
01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's fucked yet.</v>

2169
01:39:08.730 --> 01:39:09.540
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2170
01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:15.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a characteristic that I see in </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everybody that I respect.</v>

2171
01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:19.830
<v Speaker 1>They all think that everything they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>socks or at least they have very,</v>

2172
01:39:19.831 --> 01:39:22.980
<v Speaker 1>very high standards and are often </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointed by their own work.</v>

2173
01:39:23.530 --> 01:39:24.190
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2174
01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:27.850
<v Speaker 5>I think I have some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I also have that idea of like,</v>

2175
01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:33.920
<v Speaker 5>it's something that might.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I talked about my dad </v>

2176
01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:33.920
<v Speaker 5>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

2177
01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:35.590
<v Speaker 5>he was my wrestling coach in high </v>
<v Speaker 5>school.</v>

2178
01:39:35.890 --> 01:39:37.090
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was also my,</v>

2179
01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:42.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>earth science biology and environmental </v>

2180
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.520
<v Speaker 5>studies teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was my teacher.</v>

2181
01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:43.990
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what a drag you went to school,</v>

2182
01:39:44.290 --> 01:39:49.290

<v Speaker 5>And I learned a lot because he was no </v>

2183
01:39:49.290 --> 01:39:50.170
<v Speaker 5>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't pull any punches for me.</v>

2184
01:39:50.171 --> 01:39:50.700
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2185
01:39:50.710 --> 01:39:55.710
<v Speaker 5>he drove me as hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if not harder than of his other </v>

2186
01:39:55.710 --> 01:39:55.710
<v Speaker 5>students.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't show any favoritism,</v>

2187
01:39:56.230 --> 01:39:58.540
<v Speaker 5>but one of the things that was always </v>
<v Speaker 5>his thing on the mat,</v>

2188
01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:02.230
<v Speaker 5>and I'm kind of paraphrasing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but basically you,</v>

2189
01:40:02.670 --> 01:40:07.670
<v Speaker 5>you either win or you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in that high school college </v>

2190
01:40:07.871 --> 01:40:08.430
<v Speaker 5>setting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

2191
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:10.390
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're learning about yourself.</v>

2192
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:15.390
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you went out there and you got your </v>

2193
01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:16.870
<v Speaker 5>ass handed to you and you just got beat </v>
<v Speaker 5>and didn't learn anything,</v>

2194
01:40:16.871 --> 01:40:18.070
<v Speaker 5>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a fucking loser.</v>

2195
01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:21.310
<v Speaker 5>Take the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>reflect on it,</v>

2196
01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:25.690
<v Speaker 5>build on what you did wrong and you now </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're actually gonna wave one.</v>

2197
01:40:26.170 --> 01:40:29.030
<v Speaker 5>Now you know more about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know about more your.</v>

2198
01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:33.550
<v Speaker 5>Your limitations are what you need to </v>
<v Speaker 5>improve and expand your talents are your</v>

2199
01:40:33.551 --> 01:40:37.000
<v Speaker 5>limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I guess whenever I'm doing a thing,</v>

2200
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:42.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm always looking at it from a learning</v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective so there aren't necessarily </v>

2201
01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:45.700
<v Speaker 5>mistakes unless they're fatal and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you wouldn't know anyway.</v>

2202
01:40:45.701 --> 01:40:49.210
<v Speaker 5>So whatever that really is the right way</v>
<v Speaker 5>to look at everything.</v>

2203
01:40:49.730 --> 01:40:54.730
<v Speaker 1>When are you learn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you have great experiences </v>

2204
01:40:54.730 --> 01:40:58.621
<v Speaker 1>because you were successful or you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>very beneficial experiences because you </v>

2205
01:40:58.621 --> 01:41:01.870
<v Speaker 1>realized what went wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this one more wrinkle,</v>

2206
01:41:01.871 --> 01:41:06.871
<v Speaker 1>one more piece of information or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Glenmore experience that you can add to </v>

2207
01:41:06.871 --> 01:41:09.580
<v Speaker 1>your database of knowledge and it'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you better at everything.</v>

2208
01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.170
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of ways,</v>

2209
01:41:11.171 --> 01:41:16.171
<v Speaker 1>that's my biggest frustration in life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there is something that goes wrong </v>

2210
01:41:16.171 --> 01:41:20.340
<v Speaker 1>and I can't figure out what it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's frustrating for me because I </v>

2211
01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:21.280
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't build on it.</v>

2212
01:41:21.281 --> 01:41:25.840
<v Speaker 1>I can't learn from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't understand what went wrong.</v>

2213
01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:31.340
<v Speaker 1>But what was a relationship or whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something I tried to build or </v>

2214
01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:32.170
<v Speaker 1>something I did or how often does that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>

2215
01:41:33.810 --> 01:41:34.540
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2216
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2217
01:41:34.931 --> 01:41:39.931
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of times I've actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>had an opportunity to do a vocal with </v>

2218
01:41:39.931 --> 01:41:41.700
<v Speaker 1>somebody else as a guest singer and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2219
01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:44.800
<v Speaker 1>rehearsal was great and then you blew it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

2220
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:46.600
<v Speaker 1>for the main event.</v>

2221
01:41:46.990 --> 01:41:48.400
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did I do wrong?</v>

2222
01:41:48.401 --> 01:41:53.401
<v Speaker 1>I did everything the same and until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can actually pinpoint that and figure </v>

2223
01:41:53.401 --> 01:41:56.530
<v Speaker 1>out what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking mess.</v>

2224
01:41:56.531 --> 01:41:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm slipping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm waking up in the middle of the night</v>

2225
01:41:58.961 --> 01:42:01.420
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what the fuck went </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

2226
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the same with comedy cut.</v>

2227
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:08.790
<v Speaker 1>That's one flub joke or one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one premise that you botched and just </v>

2228
01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:12.010
<v Speaker 1>know you'll wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll wake up to pee and go,</v>

2229
01:42:12.011 --> 01:42:13.570
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2230
01:42:13.950 --> 01:42:18.950
<v Speaker 1>just don't have to go downstairs and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of the computer and just start </v>

2231
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:19.590
<v Speaker 1>writing again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2232
01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:22.090
<v Speaker 1>just get angry at a fix this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2233
01:42:22.091 --> 01:42:23.320
<v Speaker 1>I got to figure out what's wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2234
01:42:23.321 --> 01:42:26.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make it bulletproof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2235
01:42:26.681 --> 01:42:29.920
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a unique guy in that you,</v>

2236
01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:35.220
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all these different things that </v>

2237
01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:37.711
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the Kinda like work </v>

2238
01:42:37.711 --> 01:42:37.711
<v Speaker 1>synergistically to have.</v>

2239
01:42:37.711 --> 01:42:39.180
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like you're going.</v>

2240
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:40.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't think like you're battling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

2241
01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I know people that are battling </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

2242
01:42:42.650 --> 01:42:43.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all the different things.</v>

2243
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:46.720
<v Speaker 1>But this all feeds everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stories.</v>

2244
01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:49.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm a storyteller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm involved in a lot of life.</v>

2245
01:42:49.570 --> 01:42:51.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing things on many,</v>

2246
01:42:51.551 --> 01:42:54.340
<v Speaker 1>many levels because in order to tell a </v>
<v Speaker 1>full,</v>

2247
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:56.890
<v Speaker 1>more complete picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a better story,</v>

2248
01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:02.160
<v Speaker 1>having more information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good a good actor is going to do is </v>

2249
01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:03.340
<v Speaker 1>research on the character beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 1>character is going to find out about the</v>

2250
01:43:03.341 --> 01:43:08.341
<v Speaker 1>region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the character supposedly from and the </v>

2251
01:43:08.341 --> 01:43:08.341
<v Speaker 1>history of their family's history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what,</v>

2252
01:43:08.341 --> 01:43:12.830
<v Speaker 1>they're going to add all these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>then so that like when they had their </v>

2253
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:13.780
<v Speaker 1>one line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that history is behind their eyes.</v>

2254
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:16.060
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2255
01:43:16.090 --> 01:43:18.370
<v Speaker 1>for writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for winemaking,</v>

2256
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.000
<v Speaker 1>they're all crossing over together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all feeding each other to make </v>

2257
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.390
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make it a whole presentation.</v>

2258
01:43:25.810 --> 01:43:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're managing the,</v>

2259
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:33.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a crop of grapes and putting together a </v>

2260
01:43:33.550 --> 01:43:36.841
<v Speaker 1>wine and you got a restaurant going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're working on your Jujitsu and then </v>

2261
01:43:36.841 --> 01:43:41.431
<v Speaker 1>you're writing songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're living all these different </v>

2262
01:43:41.431 --> 01:43:44.851
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have so much feeding into your </v>

2263
01:43:44.851 --> 01:43:47.791
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many variables that you're </v>

2264
01:43:47.791 --> 01:43:50.971
<v Speaker 1>attending to that it just keeps your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind sharp and fresh and it creates</v>

2265
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:54.620
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not new necessarily like conflict,</v>

2266
01:43:54.621 --> 01:43:59.621
<v Speaker 6>but the issue is live things that need </v>
<v Speaker 6>to be figured out and solutions need to </v>

2267
01:44:00.531 --> 01:44:05.531
<v Speaker 6>be created for problems.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not like there's something that </v>

2268
01:44:05.531 --> 01:44:08.000
<v Speaker 6>happens to certain people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They get too locked into one thing.</v>

2269
01:44:08.001 --> 01:44:11.870
<v Speaker 6>I feel that they just run out of juice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They run out of things to discuss.</v>

2270
01:44:11.871 --> 01:44:15.680
<v Speaker 6>They run out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>run out of run out of perspective.</v>

2271
01:44:15.930 --> 01:44:16.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2272
01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:18.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're,</v>

2273
01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:20.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>during the seventies,</v>

2274
01:44:20.701 --> 01:44:23.220
<v Speaker 5>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a era of music coming out.</v>

2275
01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:26.640
<v Speaker 5>First two records are probably those </v>
<v Speaker 5>people spent the whole,</v>

2276
01:44:26.641 --> 01:44:31.641
<v Speaker 5>their whole lives writing those two </v>
<v Speaker 5>records and the third record is all </v>

2277
01:44:31.641 --> 01:44:34.671
<v Speaker 5>about the bus or the travel or the are </v>
<v Speaker 5>the shitty record label or a manager.</v>

2278
01:44:37.171 --> 01:44:40.920
<v Speaker 5>Like it's all the road that's the road </v>
<v Speaker 5>album because,</v>

2279
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:43.680
<v Speaker 5>well where the fuck have they been for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the last three years,</v>

2280
01:44:43.770 --> 01:44:47.250
<v Speaker 5>but in a bus or in an airport and hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So those,</v>

2281
01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:52.460
<v Speaker 5>those albums ended up being the ones </v>
<v Speaker 5>that either make or break the band as </v>

2282
01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:53.080
<v Speaker 5>far as getting past a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>

2283
01:44:53.190 --> 01:44:55.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in general I'm speaking very generally.</v>

2284
01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:56.510
<v Speaker 6>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2285
01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:01.640
<v Speaker 6>But it's the same with comics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's this with comics it's usually you </v>

2286
01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:04.080
<v Speaker 6>have one or two good specials and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a big drop off.</v>

2287
01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:09.860
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's guys run out of stuff to </v>

2288
01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:12.051
<v Speaker 6>talk about and usually you work for like</v>
<v Speaker 6>10 years before you do anything before </v>

2289
01:45:12.811 --> 01:45:16.620
<v Speaker 6>you release anything that the best guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it seems like they worked like 10,</v>

2290
01:45:16.650 --> 01:45:21.650
<v Speaker 6>10 years and then they put out an album </v>
<v Speaker 6>or a comedy special or whatever it is </v>

2291
01:45:21.650 --> 01:45:22.990
<v Speaker 6>and then you just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>

2292
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:28.000
<v Speaker 6>your life is about performing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your life is about doing that and you </v>

2293
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.850
<v Speaker 6>don't have enough options outside of </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

2294
01:45:29.851 --> 01:45:32.850
<v Speaker 6>Like a lot of comics turned to airline </v>
<v Speaker 6>jokes and you know,</v>

2295
01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:36.270
<v Speaker 6>things like hotels and he started </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about that.</v>

2296
01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:38.620

<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2309

<v Speaker 5>A lot of actors I've taught here have </v>
<v Speaker 5>met that have gotten on a roll with a </v>

2310
01:46:17.421 --> 01:46:19.940
<v Speaker 5>good series,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a TV series.</v>

2311
01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:23.720
<v Speaker 5>A lot of them will say the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like about a couple of seasons in.</v>

2312
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:28.990
<v Speaker 5>He started looking at the door because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're acting muscles start to atrophy </v>

2313
01:46:29.210 --> 01:46:34.210
<v Speaker 5>if you're only being this guy on that </v>
<v Speaker 5>show for eight years.</v>

2314
01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:38.280
<v Speaker 6>Do they start going crazy and going into</v>
<v Speaker 6>drugs and buying houses?</v>

2315
01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:39.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2316
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:44.990
<v Speaker 5>So you start to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you start to get a little spiral so you </v>

2317
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:44.990
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to get out and be able to do a few films</v>

2318
01:46:45.230 --> 01:46:48.600
<v Speaker 5>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alec William Peterson was on CSI,</v>

2319
01:46:48.601 --> 01:46:52.440
<v Speaker 5>the CSR forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's does theater now.</v>

2320
01:46:53.250 --> 01:46:54.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would think you would have to.</v>

2321
01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:56.710
<v Speaker 5>That's the guy from to live and die in </v>
<v Speaker 5>La.</v>

2322
01:46:56.710 --> 01:46:58.030
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forgot about that movie.</v>

2323
01:46:58.031 --> 01:46:59.760
<v Speaker 5>And Hunter Peep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2324
01:46:59.761 --> 01:47:04.761
<v Speaker 5>That was the original Hannibal Lecter </v>
<v Speaker 5>movie with a different Guy Than Anthony </v>

2325
01:47:04.761 --> 01:47:04.761
<v Speaker 5>Hopkins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a great movie.</v>

2326
01:47:04.761 --> 01:47:06.180
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forgotten.</v>

2327
01:47:06.181 --> 01:47:09.170
<v Speaker 5>Moving to live in Dianella is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>forgotten movie.</v>

2328
01:47:09.171 --> 01:47:13.860
<v Speaker 5>That is a great fucking movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian Cox is Dr Lecter and there he is.</v>

2329
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:15.780
<v Speaker 5>Handsome faster back then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2330
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:20.990
<v Speaker 5>look at him and he's just his sharpening</v>
<v Speaker 5>his chops on the theater stage because </v>

2331
01:47:20.990 --> 01:47:25.641
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a true that guys that got the real </v>

2332
01:47:25.641 --> 01:47:27.900
<v Speaker 5>deal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's on CSI to get paid.</v>

2333
01:47:29.210 --> 01:47:34.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess initially I think most likely </v>

2334
01:47:34.210 --> 01:47:35.460
<v Speaker 5>when that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when that whole new era of TV was coming</v>

2335
01:47:35.461 --> 01:47:38.160
<v Speaker 5>out as it probably seemed like a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea for him to kind of just,</v>

2336
01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:40.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it probably had some bills to pay and he</v>

2337
01:47:40.561 --> 01:47:42.170
<v Speaker 5>wants you to get on their taking.</v>

2338
01:47:42.190 --> 01:47:47.190
<v Speaker 5>It was going to be a couple seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just going to get out of their </v>

2339
01:47:47.190 --> 01:47:48.480
<v Speaker 5>contract and they're going to keep you </v>
<v Speaker 5>around if you do this,</v>

2340
01:47:48.530 --> 01:47:53.530
<v Speaker 5>but I want to do this theater thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to go do Shakespeare in the park </v>

2341
01:47:53.530 --> 01:47:54.730
<v Speaker 5>and they'll punish you if you leave too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2342
01:47:55.170 --> 01:48:00.170
<v Speaker 5>the black volume.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This motherfucker will leave a series </v>

2343
01:48:00.170 --> 01:48:00.170
<v Speaker 5>when it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2344
01:48:00.170 --> 01:48:00.810
<v Speaker 5>so ruined does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2345
01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:01.680
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know him.</v>

2346
01:48:01.681 --> 01:48:06.681
<v Speaker 5>I don't know his decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think a speaking to a lot of </v>

2347
01:48:06.681 --> 01:48:06.990
<v Speaker 5>different people that have been in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation,</v>

2348
01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.400
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2349
01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:12.240
<v Speaker 5>you kind of waited it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if I just stick with this thing for</v>

2350
01:48:12.330 --> 01:48:13.770
<v Speaker 5>six seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight seasons,</v>

2351
01:48:13.771 --> 01:48:15.780
<v Speaker 5>I have enough money in the bank for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rest of my life,</v>

2352
01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:17.620
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2353
01:48:18.050 --> 01:48:21.390
<v Speaker 5>and then I'll have to fight my way back </v>
<v Speaker 5>a couple of years,</v>

2354
01:48:21.550 --> 01:48:24.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of detoxing from that very.</v>

2355
01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:27.270
<v Speaker 5>It could be a great situation because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have.</v>

2356
01:48:27.290 --> 01:48:29.910
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2357
01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:31.800
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what happened at Johnny </v>
<v Speaker 5>Depp.</v>

2358
01:48:32.630 --> 01:48:37.630
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Johnny Depp when he started doing those </v>

2359
01:48:37.630 --> 01:48:37.630

<v Speaker 5>point in time and I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He started buying all that shit when he </v>

2411
01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:58.320
<v Speaker 3>got that pirates of the Caribbean money </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you don't really want to be Jack</v>

2412
01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:01.140
<v Speaker 3>Sparrow every fucking day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I want to do something else.</v>

2413
01:51:01.141 --> 01:51:03.240
<v Speaker 3>You can't do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every time he does something else,</v>

2414
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:08.350
<v Speaker 3>it just doesn't really work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really work like the pirates </v>

2415
01:51:08.350 --> 01:51:08.480
<v Speaker 3>of the Caribbean guide does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2416
01:51:08.490 --> 01:51:13.490
<v Speaker 3>like how many different movies is he </v>
<v Speaker 3>done since you've done the pirates of </v>

2417
01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:13.490
<v Speaker 3>the Caribbean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couple.</v>

2418
01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:14.530
<v Speaker 3>Couple?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2419
01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:16.320
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did Edward Scissorhands.</v>

2420
01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:21.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did the Alice in wonderland thing </v>

2421
01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:21.980
<v Speaker 3>since the pirates of the Caribbean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was actually really good.</v>

2422
01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:22.920
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed it,</v>

2423
01:51:22.921 --> 01:51:24.010
<v Speaker 3>but I enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2424
01:51:25.110 --> 01:51:26.670
<v Speaker 3>Well they want go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2425
01:51:29.850 --> 01:51:32.250
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

2426
01:51:32.730 --> 01:51:35.100
<v Speaker 3>point being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go crazy.</v>

2427
01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:37.530
<v Speaker 3>They just start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start spending,</v>

2428
01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:41.820
<v Speaker 3>buying stopped buying and spending to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get caught now where?</v>

2429
01:51:41.821 --> 01:51:46.821
<v Speaker 3>Howard Hughes and a downward spiral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does this movie tonto and the lone </v>

2430
01:51:47.761 --> 01:51:48.720
<v Speaker 3>ranger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2431
01:51:48.810 --> 01:51:53.810
<v Speaker 3>The 10 worst Johnny Depp movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't that a guy that died and came </v>

2432
01:51:54.271 --> 01:51:57.390
<v Speaker 3>back to life or something like that or </v>
<v Speaker 3>he had the lone ranger come back to life</v>

2433
01:51:57.540 --> 01:52:00.750
<v Speaker 3>and it helped him come back to life </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes back to life or something.</v>

2434
01:52:01.050 --> 01:52:06.050
<v Speaker 3>I think that's cultural appropriation </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't believe that he's </v>

2435
01:52:06.050 --> 01:52:06.050
<v Speaker 3>Indian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm offended.</v>

2436
01:52:06.050 --> 01:52:09.530
<v Speaker 3>How come they couldn't get a native </v>
<v Speaker 3>American Indian?</v>

2437
01:52:09.570 --> 01:52:11.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's A.</v>

2438
01:52:11.970 --> 01:52:13.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a hard time with all that.</v>

2439
01:52:13.210 --> 01:52:14.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm know what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2440
01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:17.550
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have you own guns?</v>

2441
01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:18.350
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2442
01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:19.830
<v Speaker 3>But you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2443
01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:22.150
<v Speaker 3>you're a pot smoker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a your.</v>

2444
01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:24.000
<v Speaker 3>Would you consider yourself a liberal?</v>

2445
01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:26.130
<v Speaker 3>A more liberal than I am conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2446
01:52:26.150 --> 01:52:27.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

2447
01:52:27.061 --> 01:52:28.310
<v Speaker 3>there's that balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2448
01:52:28.890 --> 01:52:32.850
<v Speaker 3>you think the make ribs like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2449
01:52:33.390 --> 01:52:36.170
<v Speaker 3>don't call me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to be now from out,</v>

2450
01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:36.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2451
01:52:36.490 --> 01:52:37.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an avocado,</v>

2452
01:52:37.651 --> 01:52:40.890
<v Speaker 3>I relate to avocado.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as my,</v>

2453
01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:43.890
<v Speaker 3>my sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I relate to an avocado.</v>

2454
01:52:43.891 --> 01:52:48.891
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And don't think you're allowed to </v>

2455
01:52:48.891 --> 01:52:48.891
<v Speaker 3>identify as an avocado now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2456
01:52:48.891 --> 01:52:51.230
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing just,</v>

2457
01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:52.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2458
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:57.790
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need a meteor I guess when it comes </v>

2459
01:52:57.790 --> 01:52:59.480
<v Speaker 3>to talking about guns and avocado,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like you know,</v>

2460
01:52:59.570 --> 01:53:02.510
<v Speaker 3>just that whole the politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

2461
01:53:02.511 --> 01:53:07.511
<v Speaker 3>but then the anti electric intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 3>ism that comes from what I would </v>

2462
01:53:07.511 --> 01:53:08.420
<v Speaker 3>consider the lower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2463
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:10.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a far right that it does go anti</v>

2464
01:53:10.911 --> 01:53:15.470
<v Speaker 3>intellectual ism and then there's far </v>
<v Speaker 3>left that even though they might be more</v>

2465
01:53:15.471 --> 01:53:20.471
<v Speaker 3>well read and maybe intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they put up these blinders to a certain </v>

2466
01:53:20.471 --> 01:53:21.650
<v Speaker 3>patterns of thinking as well.</v>

2467
01:53:21.650 --> 01:53:26.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot of like across the </v>

2468
01:53:26.650 --> 01:53:29.231
<v Speaker 3>board objectivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people formulating </v>

2469
01:53:29.231 --> 01:53:32.291
<v Speaker 3>these preformed patterns of opinions </v>
<v Speaker 3>that conservative opinions and just </v>

2470
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:35.690
<v Speaker 3>clinging to it or liberal opinions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>cleaning to it.</v>

2471
01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:38.430
<v Speaker 3>I think there's no gray area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2472
01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:41.600
<v Speaker 3>I think most people media lots of gray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of gray area.</v>

2473
01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:42.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meteor.</v>

2474
01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:47.860
<v Speaker 3>I think most people really share like </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas that are conservative and liberal </v>

2475
01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:50.120
<v Speaker 3>and I think what's really important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should be able to discuss these ideas</v>

2476
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:54.530
<v Speaker 3>without digging our heels and just being</v>
<v Speaker 3>fully committed to one team or the other</v>

2477
01:53:54.531 --> 01:53:56.060
<v Speaker 3>team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where the problem lies.</v>

2478
01:53:56.210 --> 01:54:00.140
<v Speaker 3>People would so tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's conservative or liberal,</v>

2479
01:54:00.141 --> 01:54:05.141
<v Speaker 3>even libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go real tribal and they just like </v>

2480
01:54:05.141 --> 01:54:08.150
<v Speaker 3>lock onto those ideas and this is right </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that is wrong and you know,</v>

2481
01:54:08.151 --> 01:54:09.590
<v Speaker 3>and it just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't want.</v>

2482
01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:14.800
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to give in and so then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they fight and they dig their heels in </v>

2483
01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:15.050
<v Speaker 3>and they know they fight their opinion.</v>

2484
01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:17.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm an arm snowflake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

2485
01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:19.400
<v Speaker 3>is that a new category?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do that.</v>

2486
01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:21.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should be able to do that.</v>

2487
01:54:21.110 --> 01:54:26.110
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who could stop you from being an </v>

2488
01:54:26.110 --> 01:54:26.110
<v Speaker 3>snowflake?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have bullets and shit.</v>

2489
01:54:26.110 --> 01:54:27.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regular snowflakes don't have bullets.</v>

2490
01:54:28.130 --> 01:54:30.220
<v Speaker 3>Superman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2491
01:54:30.710 --> 01:54:32.370
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're,</v>

2492
01:54:32.371 --> 01:54:37.371
<v Speaker 3>we're moving into a new stage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity is as profound and ridiculous </v>

2493
01:54:37.371 --> 01:54:39.110
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>verbose as that sounds.</v>

2494
01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:44.980
<v Speaker 3>I really think that's what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think all this in fighting and </v>

2495
01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:45.200
<v Speaker 3>squabbling is we're trying to find our </v>
<v Speaker 3>footing,</v>

2496
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:50.770
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out what we are and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're doing and guns are part of </v>

2497
01:54:50.770 --> 01:54:50.770
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2498
01:54:50.770 --> 01:54:53.420
<v Speaker 3>should you be allowed to just have that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know.</v>

2499
01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:55.250
<v Speaker 3>Every now and then it goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2500
01:54:55.251 --> 01:55:00.251
<v Speaker 3>if it goes wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you want to be able to protect </v>

2501
01:55:00.251 --> 01:55:00.251
<v Speaker 3>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2502
01:55:00.251 --> 01:55:00.251
<v Speaker 3>you got a point.</v>

2503
01:55:00.251 --> 01:55:00.251
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a point.</v>

2504
01:55:00.251 --> 01:55:02.930
<v Speaker 3>No one should have one you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what about when the bad people come?</v>

2505
01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:04.870
<v Speaker 3>Should you have one then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2506
01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:07.360
<v Speaker 3>she just let the bad people will kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and then it's all bad people.</v>

2507
01:55:07.361 --> 01:55:10.370
<v Speaker 3>I've had the good people are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well who's that?</v>

2508
01:55:10.490 --> 01:55:15.490
<v Speaker 3>Who's to determine what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a person gets a hold of it and they </v>

2509
01:55:15.490 --> 01:55:16.410
<v Speaker 3>do a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's all these variables but I,</v>

2510
01:55:16.411 --> 01:55:21.411
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's that cut and dry and </v>

2511
01:55:21.411 --> 01:55:22.290
<v Speaker 3>I also think it's a lot like everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>else here.</v>

2512
01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Media or maybe what part if you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at a part of the world without </v>

<v Speaker 3>pissing anybody off without,</v>

01:55:58.890 --> 01:56:00.620
<v Speaker 5>flexor their missile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

2526
01:56:00.621 --> 01:56:05.621
<v Speaker 5>So I love that series because you get </v>
<v Speaker 5>better after the first episode that </v>

2527
01:56:05.621 --> 01:56:05.940
<v Speaker 5>looks set in a bunch of stuff up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2528
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:08.630
<v Speaker 5>I mean as a lot of setup,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but just the concept right away,</v>

2529
01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:10.760
<v Speaker 5>storyteller.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love the a good story.</v>

2530
01:56:11.450 --> 01:56:16.010
<v Speaker 5>A huge percentage of the population just</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking vanishes with no explanation.</v>

2531
01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:19.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in and all the psychological and all</v>

2532
01:56:19.971 --> 01:56:24.971
<v Speaker 5>the religious stuff that unfolds and </v>
<v Speaker 5>collapses and builds up and freaks out </v>

2533
01:56:24.971 --> 01:56:29.590
<v Speaker 5>based on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if we're going to do something </v>

2534
01:56:29.590 --> 01:56:29.590
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2535
01:56:29.590 --> 01:56:34.240
<v Speaker 5>it would have to be spontaneous </v>
<v Speaker 5>combustion from a percentage of the </v>

2536
01:56:34.791 --> 01:56:38.120
<v Speaker 5>globe across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2537
01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:39.970
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2538
01:56:40.050 --> 01:56:41.780
<v Speaker 5>There's burst into flames.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2539
01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:46.960
<v Speaker 5>That's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If five percent of the population </v>

2540
01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:49.990
<v Speaker 5>spontaneously combusting at the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>time across the globe in front of </v>

2541
01:56:51.111 --> 01:56:53.900
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And no explanation,</v>

2542
01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:56.150
<v Speaker 5>no explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we're going to talk.</v>

2543
01:56:56.510 --> 01:56:58.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's gotTa.</v>

2544
01:56:58.890 --> 01:57:00.830
<v Speaker 5>Something's gotta hit us because then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd be like,</v>

2545
01:57:00.831 --> 01:57:02.900
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously camp,</v>

2546
01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:04.400
<v Speaker 5>you want to see people maybe</v>

2547
01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:10.980
<v Speaker 6>fuck you and fuck your hits.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm all for people at Penn and spuntech </v>

2548
01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:17.220
<v Speaker 6>member when we're kids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like spontaneous combustion was a thing </v>

2549
01:57:17.220 --> 01:57:21.030
<v Speaker 6>he would wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe one of your friends will burst </v>

2550
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.450
<v Speaker 6>into flames while you're in school.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They they're lighting farts or something</v>

2551
01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:25.060
<v Speaker 6>that real spontaneous human combustion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it truly real?</v>

2552
01:57:25.150 --> 01:57:30.150
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how spontaneous human </v>
<v Speaker 6>combustion works can make that a little </v>

2553
01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:30.150
<v Speaker 6>bigger so I can read it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And December 19,</v>

2554
01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:35.101
<v Speaker 6>66,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the body of a 96 year old dr j Dot </v>

2555
01:57:35.101 --> 01:57:37.720
<v Speaker 6>Irving Bentley would discovered in his </v>
<v Speaker 6>Pennsylvania home by a meter reader,</v>

2556
01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:42.990
<v Speaker 6>actually only part of Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bentley's leg and slippered foot were </v>

2557
01:57:42.990 --> 01:57:47.191
<v Speaker 6>found.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The rest of his body had been burned to </v>

2558
01:57:47.191 --> 01:57:49.381
<v Speaker 6>ashes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A hole in the bathroom floor was the </v>

2559
01:57:49.381 --> 01:57:49.381
<v Speaker 6>only evidence of the fire that had </v>
<v Speaker 6>killed him.</v>

2560
01:57:49.381 --> 01:57:50.890
<v Speaker 6>The rest of the house remained perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 6>intact.</v>

2561
01:57:51.250 --> 01:57:56.250
<v Speaker 6>How could a man catch fire with no </v>
<v Speaker 6>apparent source of a spark or flame and </v>

2562
01:57:56.250 --> 01:57:59.641
<v Speaker 6>then burns so completely without </v>
<v Speaker 6>igniting anything around him said the </v>

2563
01:57:59.641 --> 01:57:59.641
<v Speaker 6>Washington Post?</v>

2564
01:57:59.641 --> 01:58:00.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dr.</v>

2565
01:58:00.130 --> 01:58:05.130
<v Speaker 6>Bentley's case in several hundred others</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it have been labeled spontaneous </v>

2566
01:58:05.130 --> 01:58:09.721
<v Speaker 6>human combustion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>although he and other victims of the </v>

2567
01:58:09.721 --> 01:58:12.781
<v Speaker 6>phenomena burned almost completely their</v>
<v Speaker 6>surroundings and the even sometimes </v>

2568
01:58:12.781 --> 01:58:13.960
<v Speaker 6>they're close remained virtually </v>
<v Speaker 6>untouched.</v>

2569
01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:16.240
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's just fucking bullshit.</v>

2570
01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:18.010
<v Speaker 6>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What website is this?</v>

2571
01:58:18.190 --> 01:58:19.640
<v Speaker 6>Listen Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're on fire,</v>

2572
01:58:19.650 --> 01:58:22.060
<v Speaker 6>you're fucking clothes are going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>catch fire too.</v>

2573
01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:25.990
<v Speaker 6>Unless someone's using pixie magic on </v>
<v Speaker 6>you or they did.</v>

2574
01:58:25.991 --> 01:58:28.870
<v Speaker 6>You get hit with a magic wand wielded by</v>
<v Speaker 6>an Elf.</v>

2575
01:58:28.871 --> 01:58:32.410
<v Speaker 6>You've cut your fucking clothes are </v>
<v Speaker 6>gonna burn stupid.</v>

2576
01:58:32.411 --> 01:58:34.090
<v Speaker 6>If you're burning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your clothes are burning.</v>

2577
01:58:34.091 --> 01:58:36.970
<v Speaker 6>This is horseshit sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay?</v>

2578
01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:40.360
<v Speaker 6>If spontaneous human combustion isn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>real,</v>

2579
01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:45.420
<v Speaker 6>then what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really to the many pictures that exist </v>

2580
01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:47.701
<v Speaker 6>of charred bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a possible explanation is the wick </v>

2581
01:58:47.701 --> 01:58:49.951
<v Speaker 6>effect which produces proposes that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>body when lit by a cigarette smoldering </v>

2582
01:58:50.051 --> 01:58:54.310
<v Speaker 6>ember or other heat source acts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>much like an inside out candle,</v>

2583
01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:59.820
<v Speaker 6>a candle is composed of a wick on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>inside surrounded by a wax made of </v>

2584
01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:03.870
<v Speaker 6>flammable fatty acids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The wax ignites the wick and keeps it </v>

2585
01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:07.201
<v Speaker 6>burning in the human body.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The body's fat acts as a flammable </v>

2586
01:59:07.201 --> 01:59:10.531
<v Speaker 6>substance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the victim's clothing or hail here </v>

2587
01:59:10.531 --> 01:59:11.920
<v Speaker 6>acts as the wic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As the fat melt from the heat.</v>

2588
01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:17.220
<v Speaker 6>It's soaks into the clothing and acts as</v>
<v Speaker 6>a wax like substance to keep the wick </v>

2589
01:59:17.220 --> 01:59:17.320
<v Speaker 6>burning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Slowly.</v>

2590
01:59:17.321 --> 01:59:22.321
<v Speaker 6>Scientists say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is why the victims bodies are </v>

2591
01:59:22.321 --> 01:59:22.510
<v Speaker 6>destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yet their surroundings are barely burnt.</v>

2592
01:59:22.990 --> 01:59:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're so fat that we become like a </v>

2593
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:31.470
<v Speaker 1>big greasy candle says no one's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever conclusively proven or </v>

2594
01:59:31.631 --> 01:59:32.980
<v Speaker 1>disproven the truth,</v>

2595
01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:38.200
<v Speaker 6>spontaneous human combustion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but most scientists say that there are </v>

2596
01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:41.801
<v Speaker 6>more likely explanations for the charred</v>
<v Speaker 6>remains like your wife fucking hates </v>

2597
01:59:41.801 --> 01:59:46.511
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She hates you in the head with a frying </v>

2598
01:59:46.511 --> 01:59:48.191
<v Speaker 6>pan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let your ass on fire through you in the </v>

2599
01:59:48.191 --> 01:59:48.191
<v Speaker 6>tub and say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know what happened.</v>

2600
01:59:48.191 --> 01:59:49.750
<v Speaker 6>I think it's one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ripley's believe it or not thing,</v>

2601
01:59:51.890 --> 01:59:56.890
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she seen in the embrace of the hardware </v>

2602
01:59:56.890 --> 01:59:59.761
<v Speaker 1>store manager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was crying and Stanley help me </v>

2603
01:59:59.761 --> 02:00:01.810
<v Speaker 1>watching the tick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's real.</v>

2604
02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:04.180
<v Speaker 1>I cried bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>

2605
02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:07.930
<v Speaker 1>and that's why it would make so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of an impact if it happened to five</v>

2606
02:00:07.931 --> 02:00:11.260
<v Speaker 1>percent of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think an outside threat,</v>

2607
02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:15.520
<v Speaker 1>if another planet like an impact is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wakeup call and outs,</v>

2608
02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>like spontaneous seeming alien showed up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and started shooting people from </v>

2609
02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:22.030
<v Speaker 1>spaceships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's going to go,</v>

2610
02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:23.920
<v Speaker 1>that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the government.</v>

2611
02:00:24.130 --> 02:00:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Could be right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an asteroid,</v>

2612
02:00:25.991 --> 02:00:29.050
<v Speaker 1>you realize the government cannot </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreate something the size of a city.</v>

2613
02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:33.850
<v Speaker 1>It's slamming into the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what going to happen.</v>

2614
02:00:35.710 --> 02:00:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's weird</v>

2615
02:00:37.330 --> 02:00:41.050
<v Speaker 6>care.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We care in a big way how people die,</v>

2616
02:00:41.110 --> 02:00:46.110
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like nine slash 11 was huge because </v>

2617
02:00:46.110 --> 02:00:48.540
<v Speaker 6>people caused 3000 people to die and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>world changed radically because of those</v>

2618
02:00:50.021 --> 02:00:54.970
<v Speaker 6>3000 deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But half a million people die every year</v>

2619
02:00:54.971 --> 02:00:59.971
<v Speaker 6>because of cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A half a million just in this country </v>

2620
02:00:59.971 --> 02:00:59.971
<v Speaker 6>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we're like,</v>

2621
02:00:59.971 --> 02:00:59.971
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2622
02:00:59.971 --> 02:00:59.971
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whatever.</v>

2623
02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:02.620
<v Speaker 6>Like it doesn't bother us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you die that way.</v>

2624
02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:03.350
<v Speaker 6>Well your die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm</v>

2625
02:01:03.650 --> 02:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>choking on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on pus filled lungs in some sort of </v>

2626
02:01:08.930 --> 02:01:11.750
<v Speaker 1>urgent care center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't bother us as much.</v>

2627
02:01:12.250 --> 02:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Ah,</v>

2628
02:01:12.971 --> 02:01:17.971
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have smoked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get caught in the 500th floor of</v>

2629
02:01:18.981 --> 02:01:21.530
<v Speaker 1>some fucking skyscraper and get hit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face.</v>

2630
02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some good.</v>

2631
02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:27.510
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of good books on those </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of things that,</v>

2632
02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:28.040
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2633
02:01:28.710 --> 02:01:30.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2634
02:01:30.210 --> 02:01:32.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like the Holocaust in general,</v>

2635
02:01:32.811 --> 02:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>just the intent and the focus and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hatred toward a specific group of people</v>

2636
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:41.930
<v Speaker 1>has way more than the cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cigarette smoke,</v>

2637
02:01:41.931 --> 02:01:44.900
<v Speaker 1>the cigarettes don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not angry.</v>

2638
02:01:44.901 --> 02:01:47.930
<v Speaker 1>They're not hateful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that death is not.</v>

2639
02:01:48.110 --> 02:01:48.730
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

2640
02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:52.300
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't hurt you as much as if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had the,</v>

2641
02:01:52.410 --> 02:01:57.410
<v Speaker 1>the impact of a group of people hating </v>
<v Speaker 1>another group of people so much that </v>

2642
02:01:57.410 --> 02:02:00.230
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed them in a mass,</v>

2643
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:01.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a massive event.</v>

2644
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:04.610
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of insidious though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really look at it objectively,</v>

2645
02:02:04.611 --> 02:02:09.611
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay as long as they peacefully </v>

2646
02:02:09.611 --> 02:02:11.891
<v Speaker 1>suck the vitality of your body with </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical dip plants wrapped in paper </v>

2647
02:02:14.270 --> 02:02:19.270
<v Speaker 1>that they trick you into sucking on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you light them on fire and your </v>

2648
02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:20.780
<v Speaker 1>body becomes accustomed and addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2649
02:02:20.781 --> 02:02:21.560
<v Speaker 1>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2650
02:02:21.561 --> 02:02:24.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a stress relieving choice.</v>

2651
02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:26.660
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't smoke too much.</v>

2652
02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Just as long as you only smoke a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be fun.</v>

2653
02:02:30.130 --> 02:02:32.390
<v Speaker 1>What are the statistics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that like secondhand.</v>

2654
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Secondhand is bad to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waitresses and stuff,</v>

2655
02:02:35.610 --> 02:02:39.230
<v Speaker 1>and in bars they would get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them will get cancer and people</v>

2656
02:02:39.231 --> 02:02:41.330
<v Speaker 1>that lived with people that were chronic</v>
<v Speaker 1>smokers,</v>

2657
02:02:41.331 --> 02:02:43.670
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't smokers themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them got cancer.</v>

2658
02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Secondhand smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in a small enclosed area is </v>

2659
02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:51.281
<v Speaker 1>real as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as bad as the cigarettes </v>

2660
02:02:51.281 --> 02:02:54.281
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we should have seen the first clue </v>

2661
02:02:54.281 --> 02:02:56.900
<v Speaker 1>would have been like as soon as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon as they pulled smoking off of </v>

2662
02:02:56.900 --> 02:02:56.900
<v Speaker 1>planes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2663
02:02:57.460 --> 02:03:01.590
<v Speaker 1>that must be a problem to the planes are</v>
<v Speaker 1>riddick because you're having to pay for</v>

2664
02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:03.050
<v Speaker 1>some flight attendants.</v>

2665
02:03:03.230 --> 02:03:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2666
02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.920
<v Speaker 1>That would be why those things were </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

2667
02:03:06.921 --> 02:03:10.310
<v Speaker 1>I remember they used to smoke in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back end.</v>

2668
02:03:10.311 --> 02:03:14.930
<v Speaker 1>If you smoking non nonsmoking section </v>
<v Speaker 1>separated by space,</v>

2669
02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:17.570
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Separated and a tube.</v>

2670
02:03:17.770 --> 02:03:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Second hand smoke causes approximately </v>
<v Speaker 1>7,333</v>

2671
02:03:21.111 --> 02:03:26.111
<v Speaker 1>deaths from lung cancer and 33,950</v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths from heart disease every year and</v>

2672
02:03:26.930 --> 02:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>64 and 2014 to two point $5.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Million people died from exposure to </v>

2673
02:03:32.481 --> 02:03:34.820
<v Speaker 1>secondhand smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not quite as bad.</v>

2674
02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:36.500
<v Speaker 1>It's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2675
02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:40.220
<v Speaker 1>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to 500,000,</v>

2676
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>but still it's terrible lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2677
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:46.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not as bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still fucking terrible.</v>

2678
02:03:47.150 --> 02:03:48.870
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not a.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Are they real?</v>

2684
02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Hey Siri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up with that?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2687
02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:08.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucking chunk of ice that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been monitoring.</v>

2688
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:13.870
<v Speaker 1>A glacier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the biggest glacier of the world </v>

2689
02:04:13.870 --> 02:04:16.481
<v Speaker 1>has ever known is the size of Delaware </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's floating around in the ocean </v>

2690
02:04:16.481 --> 02:04:19.760
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is so unbelievably massive.</v>

2691
02:04:19.970 --> 02:04:23.630
<v Speaker 1>You could be standing on this glacier </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not see the end of it.</v>

2692
02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:27.530
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't see how far it goes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's floating in this iceberg,</v>

2693
02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:29.390
<v Speaker 1>I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's floating.</v>

2694
02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>It broke off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 things that are smaller than this </v>

2695
02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:37.500
<v Speaker 1>iceberg.</v>

<v Speaker 3>big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Grand Canyon.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The Grand Canyon is smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Great Salt Lake is smaller.</v>

02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:07.200
<v Speaker 3>That's a sane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's separated.</v>

2704
02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:09.450
<v Speaker 3>Do they have a satellite image of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>

2705
02:05:10.330 --> 02:05:15.330
<v Speaker 3>It's separated and floated off and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to come slamming right into the </v>

2706
02:05:15.330 --> 02:05:18.380
<v Speaker 3>Santa Monica pier that you could see it </v>
<v Speaker 3>as they fly over it.</v>

2709
02:05:26.010 --> 02:05:31.010
<v Speaker 3>someone took it from a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking down with the wings and </v>

2710
02:05:31.010 --> 02:05:32.310
<v Speaker 3>where was it?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Which separates us and flatter.</v>

2713
02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:42.780
<v Speaker 3>There's all these assholes and so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't fly over Antarctica online.</v>

2714

<v Speaker 3>You absolutely can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You piece of shit.</v>

2715
02:05:44.900 --> 02:05:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Bourdain just filmed a show from</v>

2716
02:05:47.401 --> 02:05:48.720
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in Antarctica.</v>

2717
02:05:48.721 --> 02:05:51.060
<v Speaker 3>You dumped cons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He filmed the show.</v>

2718
02:05:51.250 --> 02:05:53.940
<v Speaker 3>You landed in Antarctica.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talked to the people that work in the</v>

2719
02:05:53.941 --> 02:05:56.760
<v Speaker 3>science department there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck they do,</v>

2720
02:05:56.850 --> 02:06:01.850
<v Speaker 3>running experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try and keep the Russians from invading </v>

2721
02:06:01.850 --> 02:06:03.020
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

2726
02:06:15.250 --> 02:06:17.880
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be a good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good show to combine them.</v>

2727
02:06:17.881 --> 02:06:19.140
<v Speaker 3>The wine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pasta,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the local food.</v>

2729
02:06:20.670 --> 02:06:22.540

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2730
02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:24.600
<v Speaker 3>you're sensing that because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>projecting it.</v>

2731
02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:26.970
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm not that guy in a bar at a thousand </v>

2734
02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:36.900

<v Speaker 3>get them some good.</v>

2736
02:06:40.090 --> 02:06:42.600
<v Speaker 3>He would do it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would film at your place.</v>

2737
02:06:42.601 --> 02:06:46.230
<v Speaker 3>It'd be a good thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I could helped orchestrate that.</v>

2738
02:06:46.950 --> 02:06:48.630
<v Speaker 3>That'd be a dopey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dopey,</v>

2739
02:06:48.770 --> 02:06:52.260
<v Speaker 3>a dove.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be a Dopa episode for a show,</v>

2740
02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:57.740
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you also have a very unique story </v>

2743
02:07:01.491 --> 02:07:01.650
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy's an addict.</v>

2744
02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:03.540
<v Speaker 3>He does it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2746
02:07:04.591 --> 02:07:07.200
<v Speaker 3>When we were in Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we filmed an episode of his show.</v>

2747
02:07:07.201 --> 02:07:10.320
<v Speaker 3>He went to a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was Bozeman,</v>

2748
02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:15.480
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Bozeman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just found some local Jujitsu club </v>

2749
02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:15.480
<v Speaker 3>was rolling with these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't even know him.</v>

2750
02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:17.190
<v Speaker 3>He gets in there and started training </v>
<v Speaker 3>with him.</v>

2751
02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:18.810
<v Speaker 3>He's an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

2752
02:07:18.930 --> 02:07:21.850
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't fuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does it out overseas to like one 80.</v>

2753
02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:23.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's very tall.</v>

2754
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:27.570
<v Speaker 3>I think he's like at least six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three and he's thin.</v>

2755
02:07:27.630 --> 02:07:31.410
<v Speaker 3>He's lost a ton of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lost 30 pounds from doing Jujitsu.</v>

2756
02:07:31.590 --> 02:07:34.920
<v Speaker 3>He was on all sorts of WHO's on statens </v>
<v Speaker 3>for high blood,</v>

2757
02:07:35.710 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 3>high</v>

2758
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:40.180
<v Speaker 6>cholesterol because of his diet and </v>
<v Speaker 6>sedentary lifestyle and you know,</v>

2759
02:07:40.181 --> 02:07:40.930
<v Speaker 6>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2760
02:07:40.990 --> 02:07:45.990
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have the choice between changing what </v>

2761
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:47.170
<v Speaker 6>I eat right and I don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to keep eating pork and all these</v>

2762
02:07:47.171 --> 02:07:52.171
<v Speaker 6>delicious foods or taking these stat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so we just decided to take the </v>

2763
02:07:52.171 --> 02:07:52.180
<v Speaker 6>statens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but once he started training Jujitsu,</v>

2764
02:07:52.181 --> 02:07:53.430
<v Speaker 6>he got off all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2765
02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:56.410
<v Speaker 6>Just his body just responded to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>demands.</v>

2766
02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:57.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2767
02:07:57.790 --> 02:07:59.760
<v Speaker 6>Your body responds to the demands,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2768
02:07:59.850 --> 02:08:04.850
<v Speaker 6>I think that's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an unheralded factors in people's </v>

2769
02:08:04.850 --> 02:08:09.010
<v Speaker 6>obesity is not just the Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is a huge factor for sure,</v>

2770
02:08:09.011 --> 02:08:11.410
<v Speaker 6>but also the requirements that you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>asking of your body.</v>

2771
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:14.520
<v Speaker 6>Only the bodies are not used to sitting </v>
<v Speaker 6>around doing nothing.</v>

2772
02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:17.230
<v Speaker 6>Go to get up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go to get,</v>

2773
02:08:17.470 --> 02:08:20.920
<v Speaker 6>go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'd go off to a cat.</v>

2774
02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:22.330
<v Speaker 6>Can I ask you a question?</v>

2775
02:08:22.330 --> 02:08:23.020
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>please do.</v>

2776
02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:25.510
<v Speaker 6>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's the Hollywood Babylon,</v>

2777
02:08:25.570 --> 02:08:28.900
<v Speaker 6>but over a what happened with Nuñez?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2778
02:08:28.901 --> 02:08:33.901
<v Speaker 6>she got something called sinus status.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She has apparently like severe sinus </v>

2779
02:08:35.231 --> 02:08:40.210
<v Speaker 6>infections that affect our balance and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they get really bad and um,</v>

2780
02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:45.300
<v Speaker 6>she got one the day of the weigh ins.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She made it through the weigh ends and </v>

2781
02:08:45.300 --> 02:08:50.041
<v Speaker 6>then she was having like a serious </v>
<v Speaker 6>episode to the point where they checked </v>

2782
02:08:50.041 --> 02:08:53.260
<v Speaker 6>her into the hospital and the word was </v>
<v Speaker 6>that she wanted to compete,</v>

2783
02:08:53.261 --> 02:08:55.180
<v Speaker 6>but her coaches did not want her to </v>
<v Speaker 6>compete.</v>

2784
02:08:55.181 --> 02:08:55.450
<v Speaker 6>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

2785
02:08:55.451 --> 02:08:56.980
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're having like a really hard time,</v>

2786
02:08:56.981 --> 02:09:01.981
<v Speaker 6>like walking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like apparently when your sciences get </v>

2787
02:09:01.981 --> 02:09:02.140
<v Speaker 6>like really inflamed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it fucks with your equilibrium.</v>

2788
02:09:02.190 --> 02:09:02.910
<v Speaker 6>Inner ear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2789
02:09:03.070 --> 02:09:05.650
<v Speaker 6>This is second and third hand by the </v>
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>

2790
02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:07.230
<v Speaker 6>I didn't talk to her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2791
02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:08.650
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2792
02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:11.050
<v Speaker 6>that's what you'd have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to have her talk about it,</v>

2793
02:09:11.051 --> 02:09:13.610
<v Speaker 6>but it's super unfortunate because that </v>
<v Speaker 6>was,</v>

2794
02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:18.820
<v Speaker 6>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was the highest level women's mma bout </v>

2795
02:09:18.820 --> 02:09:21.930
<v Speaker 6>ever in terms of the overall ability of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the two athletes.</v>

2796
02:09:22.570 --> 02:09:25.060
<v Speaker 6>I think Valentina Shevchenko and Amanda </v>
<v Speaker 6>Nunez,</v>

2797
02:09:25.061 --> 02:09:27.160
<v Speaker 6>they represent the peak.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These are the,</v>

2798
02:09:27.190 --> 02:09:29.020
<v Speaker 6>this is the best we've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2799
02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:34.260
<v Speaker 6>Nunez is a ruthless knockout striker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She beat the shit out of Ronda Rousey </v>

2800
02:09:34.260 --> 02:09:34.850
<v Speaker 6>and she choked the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She takes,</v>

2801
02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:37.270
<v Speaker 6>she's a real legit black belt in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>

2802
02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:42.300
<v Speaker 6>knockout stryker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then volunteership Chanko is a </v>

2803
02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:42.300
<v Speaker 6>Moitai champion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ridiculous.</v>

2804
02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:43.360
<v Speaker 6>Stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

2805
02:09:43.420 --> 02:09:45.940
<v Speaker 6>she caught Julianna Pena with an arm bar</v>
<v Speaker 6>from the guard.</v>

2806
02:09:45.941 --> 02:09:50.941
<v Speaker 6>Like her ground game is nasty to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Penny is legit for her to catch penny </v>

2807
02:09:50.941 --> 02:09:53.230
<v Speaker 6>with an arm bars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's staggering.</v>

2808
02:09:53.380 --> 02:09:56.710
<v Speaker 6>And her striking is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you saw in the Holly Holm fight,</v>

2809
02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.500
<v Speaker 6>she shot Holly Holm down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whereas like,</v>

2810
02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:02.110
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holly Holm fucked up Jermaine to Rhonda,</v>

2811
02:10:02.111 --> 02:10:07.111
<v Speaker 6>me with a question mark.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kick dropped her with a straight left </v>

2812
02:10:07.111 --> 02:10:09.721
<v Speaker 6>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She never had close to that kind of </v>

2813
02:10:09.721 --> 02:10:11.461
<v Speaker 6>success against Valentina.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Valentina is super high level with her </v>

2814
02:10:11.461 --> 02:10:11.710
<v Speaker 6>striking her movement.</v>

2815
02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:16.860
<v Speaker 6>She fights southbound.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She has that beautiful check right hook </v>

2816
02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:18.820
<v Speaker 6>that she throws that like keeps </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody minding their p's and q's.</v>

2817
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:24.000
<v Speaker 6>She's at a super well rounded game,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's really unfortunate that those </v>

2818
02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:24.910
<v Speaker 6>two didn't go at it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that was going to be a good fight.</v>

2819
02:10:24.970 --> 02:10:27.250
<v Speaker 6>I think they're going to schedule it </v>
<v Speaker 6>again for the.</v>

2820
02:10:27.420 --> 02:10:31.360
<v Speaker 6>The event that is after the end of July </v>
<v Speaker 6>event,</v>

2821
02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:34.810
<v Speaker 6>I think it's 2:15.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going to schedule it for sure.</v>

2822
02:10:35.090 --> 02:10:36.560
<v Speaker 6>But then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Dana White said,</v>

2823
02:10:36.561 --> 02:10:41.360
<v Speaker 6>now Amanda Nunez would never headline in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the van again and I just don't think you</v>

2824
02:10:41.361 --> 02:10:45.620
<v Speaker 6>can force someone to fight if she really</v>
<v Speaker 6>did have a significant injury.</v>

2825
02:10:45.770 --> 02:10:49.010
<v Speaker 6>Like they said that the doctors cleared </v>
<v Speaker 6>her to fight,</v>

2826
02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:51.680
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a significant illness I should say.</v>

2827
02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:52.400
<v Speaker 6>She,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she,</v>

2828
02:10:52.401 --> 02:10:56.270
<v Speaker 6>they said the doctors cleared to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but she chose not to the company word,</v>

2829
02:10:56.810 --> 02:10:59.630
<v Speaker 6>but if she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was that fucked up?</v>

2830
02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:02.870
<v Speaker 6>I just can't imagine she wasn't that </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucked up.</v>

2831
02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:04.430
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's got to suck.</v>

2832
02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:09.640
<v Speaker 6>Have you spent millions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 6>promoting a fight and then here it is </v>

2833
02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:12.880
<v Speaker 6>and then people bought the paper view </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then it falls apart and you got to </v>

2834
02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:12.880
<v Speaker 6>give refunds and I don't know.</v>

2835
02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:17.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well welcome to welcome to the music </v>

2836
02:11:17.670 --> 02:11:20.881
<v Speaker 5>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When it was at its peak in the nineties </v>

2837
02:11:20.881 --> 02:11:21.760
<v Speaker 5>when people are like writing big checks </v>
<v Speaker 5>for stuff and like,</v>

2838
02:11:21.761 --> 02:11:26.761
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is going to begin to get mariah </v>

2839
02:11:26.761 --> 02:11:26.761
<v Speaker 5>carey for millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing.</v>

2840
02:11:26.761 --> 02:11:29.330
<v Speaker 5>And then she goes and she has a </v>
<v Speaker 5>meltdown.</v>

2841
02:11:29.331 --> 02:11:30.520
<v Speaker 5>She went crazy peers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2842
02:11:30.521 --> 02:11:33.460
<v Speaker 5>And then like the like what did we just </v>
<v Speaker 5>spend our money on?</v>

2843
02:11:33.461 --> 02:11:36.490
<v Speaker 5>What happened just now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A mariah carey go crazy.</v>

2844
02:11:36.491 --> 02:11:37.180

<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2845
02:11:37.181 --> 02:11:38.950
<v Speaker 5>I think she had a meltdown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of those.</v>

2846
02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:40.960
<v Speaker 5>Maybe she got a bad dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2847

<v Speaker 5>I wonder if you catch a bad dick while I</v>
<v Speaker 5>have never personally.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean I might.</v>

2853
02:11:57.340 --> 02:11:58.990
<v Speaker 5>There might be one in there somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder.</v>

2854
02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:00.490
<v Speaker 5>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2855
02:12:00.491 --> 02:12:01.770
<v Speaker 5>it's got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's got to be a way.</v>

2856
02:12:02.890 --> 02:12:03.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2857
02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:05.350
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody wrote a big check.</v>

2858
02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:10.620
<v Speaker 5>You have an artist who had a meltdown,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't deliver because that's you're </v>

2859
02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:12.610
<v Speaker 5>talking about were we are merchants of </v>
<v Speaker 5>emotion.</v>

2860
02:12:12.611 --> 02:12:15.820
<v Speaker 5>That's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes it can overwhelm you.</v>

2861
02:12:15.821 --> 02:12:18.190
<v Speaker 5>That is an old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is a volatile thing.</v>

2862
02:12:18.660 --> 02:12:23.660
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's story as old as time and you </v>

2863
02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:23.660
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with fighters,</v>

2864
02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:26.380
<v Speaker 5>one little dump thick walking up the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stairs to the octagon,</v>

2865
02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:30.610
<v Speaker 5>he can pull know your acl fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>separates from your body.</v>

2866
02:12:30.611 --> 02:12:31.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could slip you.</v>

2867
02:12:31.841 --> 02:12:36.841
<v Speaker 5>Kevin Randleman was backstage preparing </v>
<v Speaker 5>for a fight once and he stepped on a </v>

2868
02:12:36.841 --> 02:12:37.750
<v Speaker 5>pipe and slipped and fell on his head </v>
<v Speaker 5>and was concussed.</v>

2869
02:12:39.190 --> 02:12:40.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right</v>

2870
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:42.500
<v Speaker 6>before the main event,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right before the main event,</v>

2871
02:12:42.501 --> 02:12:44.540
<v Speaker 6>he was walking backstage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He stepped on something,</v>

2872
02:12:44.541 --> 02:12:46.410
<v Speaker 6>slipped his leg,</v>
<v Speaker 6>went up on,</v>

2873
02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:49.820
<v Speaker 6>he hit his fucking head and he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>concussed and they canceled the fight.</v>

2874
02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:53.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was like a myth.</v>

2875
02:12:53.210 --> 02:12:58.210
<v Speaker 6>I want to say that was in 1997 or 1998 </v>
<v Speaker 6>or somewhere around there and it just </v>

2876
02:12:58.210 --> 02:12:58.700
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

2877
02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:01.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that can happen for sure.</v>

2878
02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:06.580
<v Speaker 6>And then for a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's so much about who they are is </v>

2879
02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:11.560
<v Speaker 6>dependent upon their confidence and </v>
<v Speaker 6>their state of mind and if she hears </v>

2880
02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:15.611
<v Speaker 6>that the UFC is pissed at her,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she had to pull out of the fight and </v>

2881
02:13:15.611 --> 02:13:16.830
<v Speaker 6>then they say that they'll never have </v>
<v Speaker 6>her headline and event again.</v>

2882
02:13:16.831 --> 02:13:21.831
<v Speaker 6>I when she goes from being this </v>
<v Speaker 6>superstar with two spectacular </v>

2883
02:13:21.831 --> 02:13:23.510
<v Speaker 6>performances against the most popular </v>
<v Speaker 6>women's fighters of all time,</v>

2884
02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:26.540
<v Speaker 6>those two,</v>
<v Speaker 6>between Misha tate and Ronda Rousey,</v>

2885
02:13:26.541 --> 02:13:29.510
<v Speaker 6>I would say arguably the most popular </v>
<v Speaker 6>women fighters of all time.</v>

2886
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 6>Coincidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're both the hottest.</v>

2887
02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:34.130
<v Speaker 6>How weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2888
02:13:34.650 --> 02:13:36.220
<v Speaker 6>like you got to see if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>be a chicken,</v>

2889
02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:37.230
<v Speaker 6>you got to be a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

2890
02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:40.650
<v Speaker 6>it helps a lot if you're hot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't it?</v>

2891
02:13:40.860 --> 02:13:45.000
<v Speaker 6>I am not hot and I'm not a chip.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I noticed both of those things.</v>

2892
02:13:45.210 --> 02:13:48.800
<v Speaker 6>I didn't want to bring it up though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't want to rub your face in it.</v>

2893
02:13:48.990 --> 02:13:49.770
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

2895
02:13:50.820 --> 02:13:52.290
<v Speaker 6>Who knows how she's going to bounce back</v>
<v Speaker 6>from.</v>

2896
02:13:52.291 --> 02:13:54.180
<v Speaker 6>That sucks.</v>

2898
02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:58.810
<v Speaker 6>she gets through the weight cut,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she gets to the training at home.</v>

2899
02:13:59.220 --> 02:14:02.400
<v Speaker 6>Home is one on a in Singapore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was a wonderful.</v>

2900
02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:03.690
<v Speaker 6>That was great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Balm.</v>

2902
02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:08.840

<v Speaker 6>That kicks so well.</v>

2903
02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:10.710
<v Speaker 6>That's a sneaky ass fucking kick man.</v>

2904
02:14:10.710 --> 02:14:15.710
<v Speaker 6>When you think it's going to be a round </v>
<v Speaker 6>kick to the body or a low kick and then </v>

2905
02:14:15.710 --> 02:14:16.350
<v Speaker 6>it comes up high and clangs you in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>dome.</v>

2906
02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:18.810
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so good the way they throw that too</v>

2907
02:14:18.811 --> 02:14:23.040
<v Speaker 6>because it comes in like this and that </v>
<v Speaker 6>loops over clang.</v>

2908
02:14:23.370 --> 02:14:25.740

<v Speaker 6>in an MMA.</v>

2909
02:14:26.130 --> 02:14:27.910
<v Speaker 6>Luke rockhold is got a really good one </v>
<v Speaker 6>too.</v>

2910
02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:29.910

2911
02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:35.160
<v Speaker 6>They.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They throw it and it's such an unusual </v>

2912
02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:36.630
<v Speaker 6>motion of a kick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It looks like it's coming up and then it</v>

2913
02:14:36.631 --> 02:14:39.300
<v Speaker 6>just goes whip over the top,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pull up.</v>

2915
02:14:42.330 --> 02:14:47.330

<v Speaker 6>he caught him with a guillotine choke </v>

2916
02:14:47.330 --> 02:14:47.880
<v Speaker 6>afterwards and tapped him with a gay </v>
<v Speaker 6>teen,</v>

2917
02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:52.050

2926
02:15:15.750 --> 02:15:17.670

<v Speaker 6>He didn't kill him,</v>

2927
02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:21.840
<v Speaker 6>but he a clang them with the question </v>
<v Speaker 6>mark kick.</v>

2928
02:15:22.410 --> 02:15:23.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't go with Kao</v>

2929
02:15:25.590 --> 02:15:28.040
<v Speaker 6>versus Bisping One.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2930
02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:29.580
<v Speaker 6>Guillotine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here it is.</v>

2931
02:15:32.610 --> 02:15:34.260
<v Speaker 6>You got jacked?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2932
02:15:34.261 --> 02:15:36.270
<v Speaker 6>This is some guy holding up a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did it,</v>

2933
02:15:36.271 --> 02:15:41.271
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The UFC takes a lot of those things </v>

2934
02:15:41.271 --> 02:15:42.630
<v Speaker 6>down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think rockhold guillotine choke.</v>

2935
02:15:42.631 --> 02:15:44.040
<v Speaker 6>First Time bisping taps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2936
02:15:44.041 --> 02:15:49.041
<v Speaker 6>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because he was wearing a beard at the </v>

2937
02:15:49.041 --> 02:15:49.041
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Interesting.</v>

2938
02:15:49.041 --> 02:15:49.800
<v Speaker 6>They fought two times,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2939
02:15:50.910 --> 02:15:53.070
<v Speaker 6>and then rockhold thought it was going </v>
<v Speaker 6>to be an easy fight.</v>

2940
02:15:53.071 --> 02:15:55.650
<v Speaker 6>The second time and he got fucked up.</v>

2941
02:15:58.330 --> 02:16:01.990
<v Speaker 6>I think it's right before that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2942
02:16:01.991 --> 02:16:05.360
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But anyway,</v>

2943
02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:09.310
<v Speaker 6>so it's such an unusual movement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is this?</v>

2944
02:16:09.311 --> 02:16:11.290
<v Speaker 6>Just a bunch of highlights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There it is right there.</v>

2945
02:16:11.500 --> 02:16:15.790
<v Speaker 6>But they don't show the whole kick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just show that the actual end of it</v>

2946
02:16:15.791 --> 02:16:16.960
<v Speaker 6>as it's landing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Eh,</v>

2947
02:16:17.260 --> 02:16:19.330
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to show it.</v>

2948
02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:22.570
<v Speaker 6>Point being holly has got one of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>best.</v>

2949
02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:27.660

2950
02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:28.510
<v Speaker 6>combination of a boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was like a world champion boxer.</v>

2951
02:16:28.511 --> 02:16:33.040
<v Speaker 6>I think like times world champion boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but she also has like traditional karate</v>

2952
02:16:33.041 --> 02:16:38.041
<v Speaker 6>techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's throws like a lot of side kicks in </v>

2953
02:16:38.041 --> 02:16:38.041
<v Speaker 6>like these weird round kicks.</v>

2979
02:17:40.710 --> 02:17:41.710
<v Speaker 6>offensive and what isn't offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it moves.</v>

2980
02:17:41.950 --> 02:17:43.960
<v Speaker 6>It moves like the tide.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It comes in,</v>

2981
02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:45.670
<v Speaker 6>it comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There it is.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Is it time spent training for minutes?</v>

2985
02:17:52.510 --> 02:17:55.600
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The vertical hole victorious.</v>

2986
02:17:55.601 --> 02:18:00.340
<v Speaker 6>And with my junk intacct people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we know how good Rhonda is.</v>

2987
02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:02.740
<v Speaker 6>This could be epic</v>

2988
02:18:03.850 --> 02:18:08.850
<v Speaker 9>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Not to be confused with</v>

2989
02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:14.480
<v Speaker 6>conor Mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You gave Rhonda Rousey a very manly </v>

2990
02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:14.480
<v Speaker 6>appearance.</v>

2991
02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:18.380
<v Speaker 9>Nothing at the store.</v>
<v Speaker 9>What's going on here?</v>

2992
02:18:20.110 --> 02:18:20.800
<v Speaker 6>Having a lunch</v>

2993
02:18:22.590 --> 02:18:27.590
<v Speaker 9>specific diet for people at home were </v>
<v Speaker 9>watching animation.</v>

2994
02:18:34.231 --> 02:18:39.231
<v Speaker 9>If you're just listening,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Rhonda is hitting the speed bag right </v>

2995
02:18:39.231 --> 02:18:39.360
<v Speaker 9>now.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Looking very angry.</v>

2996
02:18:41.950 --> 02:18:46.950
<v Speaker 9>Commanders taking steroids and maynard </v>
<v Speaker 9>shooting stairs and it was a bad ass </v>

2997
02:18:46.950 --> 02:18:47.700
<v Speaker 9>because I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't want to lose my job.</v>

2998
02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:52.540
<v Speaker 9>I like how you have tents.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Why'd you decide to have Ted's?</v>

2999
02:18:55.210 --> 02:18:57.480
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you got a problem with that?</v>

3000
02:18:57.800 --> 02:18:58.360
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't.</v>

3001
02:18:58.370 --> 02:19:02.820
<v Speaker 9>Just on men.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I feel like it's a gender appropriation.</v>

3002
02:19:03.690 --> 02:19:04.940
<v Speaker 9>It might be.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It is.</v>

3003
02:19:04.941 --> 02:19:07.680
<v Speaker 9>So man with tits,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you don't claim transgender,</v>

3004
02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:11.870
<v Speaker 9>I got yelled at like what do you have </v>
<v Speaker 9>against people that are transgender?</v>

3005
02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:14.610
<v Speaker 9>Like you know you're giving up your </v>
<v Speaker 9>junk.</v>

3006
02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:16.560
<v Speaker 9>If you lose to Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like that's a bad thing.</v>

3007
02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:20.490
<v Speaker 9>It's okay in a bag.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Here's how it works.</v>

3008
02:19:21.430 --> 02:19:24.280
<v Speaker 6>You have something that you want to hang</v>
<v Speaker 6>onto and keep.</v>

3009
02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:29.360
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have something I want to hang onto a </v>

3010
02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:29.360
<v Speaker 6>keep,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's money or whatever,</v>

3011
02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:29.360
<v Speaker 6>and the bet is</v>

3012
02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:33.250
<v Speaker 1>that if you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to give up the thing that you </v>

3013
02:19:33.250 --> 02:19:33.250
<v Speaker 1>want to keep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

3014
02:19:33.250 --> 02:19:36.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't lose a bet and then give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you were willing to get rid of</v>

3015
02:19:36.711 --> 02:19:37.940
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

3016
02:19:38.420 --> 02:19:40.610
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a person who doesn't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>your junk,</v>

3017
02:19:41.250 --> 02:19:43.760
<v Speaker 1>just that's the choice you've made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then don't.</v>

3018
02:19:44.270 --> 02:19:45.860
<v Speaker 1>That's not really a bet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you.</v>

3019
02:19:46.420 --> 02:19:51.420
<v Speaker 1>If you're a person who wants to hang </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto your junk and you bet your junk </v>

3020
02:19:51.420 --> 02:19:51.950
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's I want my junk.</v>

3021
02:19:52.130 --> 02:19:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no disrespect to Mary.</v>

3022
02:19:53.481 --> 02:19:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Who does not want their junk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to give away?</v>

3023
02:19:55.821 --> 02:19:57.230
<v Speaker 1>If you want to cut your shit off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

3024
02:19:57.290 --> 02:19:58.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want.</v>

3025
02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:01.910
<v Speaker 1>I would like to keep my job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what my wife,</v>

3026
02:20:01.950 --> 02:20:06.950
<v Speaker 1>my wife wants me to keep my junk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a really reasonable </v>

3027
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:06.950
<v Speaker 1>request.</v>

3028
02:20:07.250 --> 02:20:12.250
<v Speaker 9>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in this video you made Donald Trump to </v>

3029
02:20:12.250 --> 02:20:13.100
<v Speaker 9>be a giant monster that must be put down</v>
<v Speaker 9>trump's Zilla.</v>

3030
02:20:13.220 --> 02:20:15.440
<v Speaker 9>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 9>do you worry that like the,</v>

3031
02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:17.630
<v Speaker 9>what they call now,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the Kathy Griffin effect?</v>

3032
02:20:17.631 --> 02:20:19.910
<v Speaker 9>Could possibly happen.</v>
<v Speaker 9>People get ahold of this video.</v>

3033
02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:22.960
<v Speaker 9>I think that you were.</v>
<v Speaker 9>My career was over a long time.</v>

3034
02:20:23.570 --> 02:20:26.420
<v Speaker 9>I don't think her career is over.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I just think it's shifted.</v>

3035
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:29.030
<v Speaker 9>It's shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's moved to a different place.</v>

3036
02:20:29.650 --> 02:20:32.930
<v Speaker 9>While she's universally hated by the </v>
<v Speaker 9>right.</v>

3037
02:20:33.770 --> 02:20:35.030
<v Speaker 9>She wasn't before she,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3038
02:20:35.060 --> 02:20:38.780
<v Speaker 9>she was just kind of Kathy Griffin.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now she's like enemy of the state.</v>

3039
02:20:40.430 --> 02:20:42.590
<v Speaker 9>It's just her trying to be relevant and </v>
<v Speaker 9>it didn't work.</v>

3040
02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:44.390
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>exactly right.</v>

3041
02:20:44.420 --> 02:20:46.290
<v Speaker 9>That's exactly what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Who is this one with?</v>

3042
02:20:46.291 --> 02:20:50.420
<v Speaker 9>The Demon said it was supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 9>Misha tape,</v>

3043
02:20:50.421 --> 02:20:52.010
<v Speaker 9>but I was trying to be kind.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

3044
02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:57.200
<v Speaker 9>so you turn turned into a demon instead </v>
<v Speaker 9>because she came out and supported </v>

3045
02:20:57.200 --> 02:20:57.200
<v Speaker 9>trump.</v>

3046
02:20:57.200 --> 02:20:58.460
<v Speaker 9>So I was gonna I was gonna throw under </v>
<v Speaker 9>the bus.</v>

3047
02:20:58.461 --> 02:20:59.910
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>She made some statements earlier,</v>

3048
02:20:59.950 --> 02:21:02.340
<v Speaker 9>like around that time.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Really.</v>

3049
02:21:02.370 --> 02:21:03.740
<v Speaker 9>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know what?</v>

3050
02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:05.810
<v Speaker 9>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 9>She might have meant something else.</v>

3051
02:21:05.811 --> 02:21:09.470
<v Speaker 9>So I made them because it used to have </v>
<v Speaker 9>her name under her.</v>

3052
02:21:09.471 --> 02:21:14.471
<v Speaker 9>There was her know as the trump minyan.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I like how the hair is all crazy.</v>

3053
02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:18.990
<v Speaker 9>You get underneath the hair.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like scalp.</v>

3054
02:21:18.991 --> 02:21:23.991
<v Speaker 9>But comes over the top and crushes you </v>
<v Speaker 9>from two bald guys.</v>

3055
02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:31.670
<v Speaker 9>Don't you want to just talk to them </v>
<v Speaker 9>about that hair and go,</v>

3056
02:21:31.671 --> 02:21:36.671
<v Speaker 9>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you are wasting so much time and effort </v>

3057
02:21:36.671 --> 02:21:36.980
<v Speaker 9>on that disaster you're keeping on top </v>
<v Speaker 9>of your head.</v>

3058
02:21:37.180 --> 02:21:37.670
<v Speaker 9>But it doesn't.</v>

3059
02:21:37.930 --> 02:21:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be just a part of the part of a</v>

3060
02:21:40.661 --> 02:21:43.480
<v Speaker 1>thing like it just keep that going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the don king thing.</v>

3061
02:21:44.110 --> 02:21:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Like it's all part of like he's got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know people have better haircuts than </v>

3062
02:21:49.110 --> 02:21:49.110
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3063
02:21:49.110 --> 02:21:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he doesn't care,</v>

3064
02:21:50.090 --> 02:21:53.020
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe part of the whole you're to do it.</v>

3065
02:21:53.050 --> 02:21:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like make it look like a hat for.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We'll have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3067
02:21:56.890 --> 02:22:01.890
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrick's spraying everything down and </v>

3068
02:22:01.890 --> 02:22:02.350
<v Speaker 1>locking it in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She got your balls in a jar that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>triggering.</v>

3070
02:22:05.530 --> 02:22:07.840
<v Speaker 1>That triggers you trot was problematic.</v>

3071
02:22:11.630 --> 02:22:16.630
<v Speaker 1>You got to be careful these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men can have balls in a jar and make it </v>

3072
02:22:16.630 --> 02:22:20.631
<v Speaker 1>seem like it's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone identifies with the type of </v>

3073
02:22:20.631 --> 02:22:21.300
<v Speaker 1>person that wants to have their balls in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a jar.</v>

3074
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:23.400
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about Trans Racial </v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

<v Speaker 1>That does the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3084
02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:41.080
<v Speaker 1>how big is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

3085
02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Five miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five miles along with kill everybody.</v>

3086
02:22:43.650 --> 02:22:48.650
<v Speaker 1>That's what killed the dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need like a football field sized </v>

3087
02:22:48.650 --> 02:22:51.810
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a hundred north 100 yards north.</v>

3088
02:22:51.811 --> 02:22:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Paul's not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul's going to cause affects around all</v>

3089
02:22:56.131 --> 02:22:58.290
<v Speaker 1>of their shores below it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

3090
02:22:58.320 --> 02:22:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at the world.</v>

3091
02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Where do we hit it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at China,</v>

3092
02:23:01.230 --> 02:23:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like they can take the hit.</v>

3093
02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I feel like they need a solution anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got a real problem.</v>

3094
02:23:07.260 --> 02:23:12.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a billion people over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying it has to be a </v>

3095
02:23:12.260 --> 02:23:12.780
<v Speaker 1>populated area?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3096
02:23:12.810 --> 02:23:14.370
<v Speaker 1>but maybe like weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you,</v>

3097
02:23:14.371 --> 02:23:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Lynne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right where they eat the dogs.</v>

3098
02:23:16.380 --> 02:23:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we go to the dog festival just and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then like everybody goes,</v>

3099
02:23:20.341 --> 02:23:21.750
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you shouldn't eat dogs.</v>

3100
02:23:21.780 --> 02:23:26.130
<v Speaker 1>God decided to hurl a media and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those assholes that are killing people's</v>

3101
02:23:26.131 --> 02:23:27.090
<v Speaker 1>pets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're killing.</v>

3102
02:23:27.940 --> 02:23:32.940
<v Speaker 1>What if it's five slightly smaller </v>
<v Speaker 1>meteors and they hit every like most </v>

3103
02:23:32.940 --> 02:23:33.840
<v Speaker 1>continents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a bad idea,</v>

3104
02:23:33.841 --> 02:23:36.490
<v Speaker 1>but I think we need one big one and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that you.</v>

3105
02:23:36.491 --> 02:23:41.491
<v Speaker 1>Lynn takes the hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching these videos where they </v>

3106
02:23:41.491 --> 02:23:44.540
<v Speaker 1>were capturing dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing people's pets and they're </v>

3107
02:23:44.540 --> 02:23:44.540
<v Speaker 1>cooking them.</v>

3108
02:23:44.540 --> 02:23:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy meet.</v>

3110
02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Let's just put it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the spot.</v>

3111
02:23:48.540 --> 02:23:51.810
<v Speaker 1>That's just put it where they make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog meat like Grad as they're cooking up</v>

3112
02:23:51.811 --> 02:23:55.480
<v Speaker 1>the dog eat dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's picking,</v>

3113
02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:57.320
<v Speaker 1>which I probably should go pick the hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog man.</v>

3114
02:23:58.530 --> 02:23:59.700
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get my.</v>

3115
02:23:59.970 --> 02:24:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Took my dog to the groomer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you really?</v>

3116
02:24:02.060 --> 02:24:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You took your dog out here.</v>

3117
02:24:04.590 --> 02:24:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Did you drive or do you fly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fly.</v>

3118
02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:11.480
<v Speaker 1>I flew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you put your dog in the bottom with </v>

3119
02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:11.970
<v Speaker 1>the regular dogs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

3120
02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.280
<v Speaker 1>she's with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she sits with you?</v>

3121
02:24:14.420 --> 02:24:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now do you have to make sure that the </v>

3122
02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:19.420
<v Speaker 1>person next to you is in gravely?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3123
02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:22.430
<v Speaker 1>allergic to dogs who have to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>you fuck them,</v>

3124
02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:24.720
<v Speaker 1>fuck them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to tell the airline,</v>

3125
02:24:24.721 --> 02:24:29.721
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm traveling with my emotional support </v>

3126
02:24:29.721 --> 02:24:29.721
<v Speaker 1>dog because I'm very fragile.</v>

3127
02:24:29.721 --> 02:24:31.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm traveling with my emotional support </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog because in theory,</v>

3128
02:24:31.471 --> 02:24:34.140
<v Speaker 1>perhaps this might have happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that we might know.</v>

3129
02:24:34.690 --> 02:24:36.680
<v Speaker 1>You're getting on an airline and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at your.</v>

3130
02:24:36.830 --> 02:24:38.940
<v Speaker 1>You're paying for a dog to go on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flight,</v>

3131
02:24:39.540 --> 02:24:44.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm paying extra for the dog to go on </v>

3132
02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:44.540
<v Speaker 1>the flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sir.</v>

3133
02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Does your dogs thing fit under the seat </v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of you?</v>

3134
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Is it fit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3135
02:24:47.611 --> 02:24:52.611
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's regulation is what you want under </v>

3136
02:24:52.611 --> 02:24:52.611
<v Speaker 1>the seat in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

3137
02:24:52.611 --> 02:24:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your other bag is too big,</v>

3138
02:24:55.650 --> 02:24:57.750
<v Speaker 1>but that's my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my carry on bag.</v>

3139
02:24:59.010 --> 02:25:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now that you're bringing a dog on,</v>

3140
02:25:01.270 --> 02:25:06.270
<v Speaker 1>that is your carry on bag and that bag </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have doesn't fit under the seat in </v>

3141
02:25:06.270 --> 02:25:08.040
<v Speaker 1>front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where my dog is going to be.</v>

3142
02:25:08.390 --> 02:25:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do?</v>

3143
02:25:10.410 --> 02:25:12.540
<v Speaker 1>So you had the choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to check the bag.</v>

3144
02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:15.420
<v Speaker 1>So you checked the bag and the dog stays</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the seat,</v>

3145
02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:18.570
<v Speaker 1>but the dog doesn't really fit under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>seat.</v>

3146
02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's 11 pounds.</v>

3147
02:25:21.210 --> 02:25:26.210
<v Speaker 1>She's small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he kinda like stuffer into that </v>

3148
02:25:26.210 --> 02:25:28.110
<v Speaker 1>crack where the laptop bag goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really small dogs in Yorkie.</v>

3149
02:25:28.510 --> 02:25:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3150
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the point is that if I had,</v>

3151
02:25:32.810 --> 02:25:37.810
<v Speaker 1>if I had a personal item that goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that goes under the seat in front of </v>

3152
02:25:37.810 --> 02:25:41.251
<v Speaker 1>me and the rolling bag goes up in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>upper space that you have paid for,</v>

3153
02:25:42.110 --> 02:25:43.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3154
02:25:44.230 --> 02:25:45.280
<v Speaker 1>but they're telling me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3155
02:25:45.281 --> 02:25:48.970
<v Speaker 1>the dog is now the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the carry on bag,</v>

3156
02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:54.180
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want me to put my dog in the </v>

3157
02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:54.180
<v Speaker 1>overhead bin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3158
02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:54.180
<v Speaker 1>it has to go into the seat in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3159
02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:56.380
<v Speaker 1>But you told me that carry on bags go in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overhead bin.</v>

3160
02:25:56.650 --> 02:26:00.520
<v Speaker 1>It's all just like red tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catch 22 crap.</v>

3161
02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:05.680
<v Speaker 1>But as your dog have an Esa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it an emotional support animal?</v>

3162
02:26:06.490 --> 02:26:09.280
<v Speaker 1>It can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it have to be?</v>

3163
02:26:09.490 --> 02:26:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you had that,</v>

3164
02:26:10.331 --> 02:26:15.331
<v Speaker 1>then we don't charge you anything and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually bring on all three of </v>

3165
02:26:15.331 --> 02:26:16.900
<v Speaker 1>those items,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dog your carry on and your personal life</v>

3166
02:26:16.901 --> 02:26:20.560
<v Speaker 1>and bring three bags on if your dogs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional support animal.</v>

3167
02:26:20.650 --> 02:26:22.780
<v Speaker 1>So if you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So luckily for me,</v>

3168
02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I can't fly without my dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3169
02:26:26.711 --> 02:26:27.760
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

3170
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:29.050
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

3171
02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:31.940
<v Speaker 6>I think Natasha has that deal to Natasha</v>
<v Speaker 6>Leggiero.</v>

3172
02:26:31.970 --> 02:26:34.190
<v Speaker 6>She was an emotional support dog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3173
02:26:34.430 --> 02:26:39.430
<v Speaker 6>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a gross loophole and I applaud </v>

3174
02:26:39.430 --> 02:26:39.890
<v Speaker 6>you for capitalizing on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So way to go.</v>

3175
02:26:41.210 --> 02:26:42.770
<v Speaker 6>Unless you're sitting next to someone </v>
<v Speaker 6>who's like,</v>

3176
02:26:43.470 --> 02:26:45.050
<v Speaker 6>I need a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I need a moment.</v>

3177
02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3178
02:26:45.471 --> 02:26:50.471
<v Speaker 6>Get your collector motions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The dogs aren't even here to support </v>

3179
02:26:50.471 --> 02:26:50.780
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do you get through it?</v>

3180
02:26:52.710 --> 02:26:53.670
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3181
02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:58.760
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pretend that the American Werewolf in </v>

3182
02:26:58.760 --> 02:26:59.560
<v Speaker 1>London with my dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good move.</v>

3183
02:27:00.180 --> 02:27:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Good move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3184
02:27:01.390 --> 02:27:03.730
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a dog by proxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3185
02:27:04.590 --> 02:27:05.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's weird.</v>

3186
02:27:05.070 --> 02:27:07.170
<v Speaker 6>Isn't a weird thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was never around.</v>

3187
02:27:07.171 --> 02:27:08.910
<v Speaker 6>We were a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why I had to pull this out.</v>

3188
02:27:08.970 --> 02:27:11.370
<v Speaker 6>Emotional support because you're fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>weak.</v>

3189
02:27:11.770 --> 02:27:16.710
<v Speaker 6>Your mind is weak and you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're fucked.</v>

3190
02:27:17.370 --> 02:27:22.370
<v Speaker 6>You can't even go to the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>starbucks without bringing your dog in </v>

3191
02:27:22.370 --> 02:27:24.300
<v Speaker 6>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you're allowed to do that.</v>

3192
02:27:24.301 --> 02:27:24.720
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's.</v>

3193
02:27:24.721 --> 02:27:26.850
<v Speaker 6>I think that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you had the paperwork,</v>

3194
02:27:26.851 --> 02:27:30.540
<v Speaker 6>you can go in to play anywhere that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not supposed to have it.</v>

3195
02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:35.600
<v Speaker 6>There's a restaurant that I go to that </v>
<v Speaker 6>one of those ladies used to be hot back </v>

3196
02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:37.590
<v Speaker 6>in the day and that she used to be on </v>
<v Speaker 6>that desperate housewives show.</v>

3197
02:27:38.050 --> 02:27:43.050
<v Speaker 6>Now she's kind of getting up there in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the years and getting a little wackier </v>

3198
02:27:43.050 --> 02:27:43.350
<v Speaker 6>and wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure as time goes on,</v>

3199
02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:46.020
<v Speaker 6>she brings in a full grown golden lab.</v>

3200
02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:51.560
<v Speaker 6>This silly bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His dog is like sitting down where </v>

3201
02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:54.870
<v Speaker 6>everybody's forks codes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dirty assholes touching the ground where</v>

3202
02:27:54.871 --> 02:27:57.870
<v Speaker 6>people accidentally dropped their spoon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just.</v>

3203
02:27:57.930 --> 02:28:00.120
<v Speaker 6>It's such a big dog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so gross.</v>

3204
02:28:00.310 --> 02:28:03.180
<v Speaker 6>It was like something about a little dog</v>
<v Speaker 6>sitting in someone's lap at a restaurant</v>

3205
02:28:03.181 --> 02:28:05.370
<v Speaker 6>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it seems stupid,</v>

3206
02:28:05.371 --> 02:28:10.371
<v Speaker 6>but maybe not so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but a lab fucking 70 pound big ass dog </v>

3207
02:28:11.701 --> 02:28:16.701
<v Speaker 6>laying on the ground and it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bitch is putting everybody else imposing</v>

3208
02:28:17.131 --> 02:28:20.620
<v Speaker 6>her situation on everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She knows it's not.</v>

3209
02:28:20.621 --> 02:28:24.980
<v Speaker 6>So do you that people that go down that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think actors do this,</v>

3210
02:28:25.220 --> 02:28:30.220
<v Speaker 6>that go down that hardcore ketogenic </v>
<v Speaker 6>diet that they cut all the carbs out of </v>

3211
02:28:30.651 --> 02:28:32.350
<v Speaker 6>their diet sugars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think it's starts to,</v>

3212
02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:35.510
<v Speaker 6>if they do it long enough to start to </v>
<v Speaker 6>get a little dinky,</v>

3213
02:28:36.180 --> 02:28:38.090
<v Speaker 6>it could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Definitely.</v>

3214
02:28:38.091 --> 02:28:43.091
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get the Keto flu when you first </v>

3215
02:28:43.091 --> 02:28:43.091
<v Speaker 6>started out.</v>

3216
02:28:43.091 --> 02:28:43.460
<v Speaker 6>I definitely got that can push people </v>
<v Speaker 6>over the top,</v>

3217
02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:48.760
<v Speaker 6>but you got to do it smart.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can't work out too hard when you first </v>

3218
02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:49.850
<v Speaker 6>start doing it and you got to take </v>
<v Speaker 6>exogenous ketones.</v>

3219
02:28:49.851 --> 02:28:51.200
<v Speaker 6>That's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 6>big.</v>

3220
02:28:51.230 --> 02:28:52.960
<v Speaker 6>That's helped me a tremendous amount.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What it,</v>

3221
02:28:53.980 --> 02:28:57.080
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck did he just say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exoneration as ketones?</v>

3222
02:28:57.140 --> 02:28:59.180
<v Speaker 6>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a bunch of different companies.</v>

3223
02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:04.720
<v Speaker 6>The one I use is called key genics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have a new one called eugenics </v>

3224
02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:04.720
<v Speaker 6>prime.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's apparently even better,</v>

3225
02:29:04.970 --> 02:29:06.080
<v Speaker 6>but what it is is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3226
02:29:06.170 --> 02:29:07.160
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3227
02:29:07.161 --> 02:29:12.161
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kama Sutra to bunch of amino acids and </v>

3228
02:29:12.161 --> 02:29:13.910
<v Speaker 6>minerals and stuff that puts your body </v>
<v Speaker 6>into a state of ketosis.</v>

3229
02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:15.290
<v Speaker 6>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3230
02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:18.260
<v Speaker 6>it allows you to balance out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

3231
02:29:18.261 --> 02:29:23.261
<v Speaker 6>it's very good to balance out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>gives you energy when you're sort of </v>

3232
02:29:23.261 --> 02:29:26.951
<v Speaker 6>struggling through that Keto flu thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then eventually body adapts body </v>

3233
02:29:26.951 --> 02:29:31.421
<v Speaker 6>gets used to burning fat and then it </v>
<v Speaker 6>just seems like it has more energy when </v>

3234
02:29:31.421 --> 02:29:31.421
<v Speaker 6>you do that.</v>

3235
02:29:31.421 --> 02:29:36.190
<v Speaker 6>But to really truly be effective,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't you hit that kind of work out two </v>

3236
02:29:36.190 --> 02:29:36.860
<v Speaker 6>hours a day to really make it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3237
02:29:37.130 --> 02:29:38.000
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

3238
02:29:38.001 --> 02:29:40.250
<v Speaker 6>You could definitely make it flip </v>
<v Speaker 6>without working out that much.</v>

3239
02:29:40.640 --> 02:29:42.110
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to work it out that much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just,</v>

3240
02:29:42.111 --> 02:29:43.460
<v Speaker 6>your body has to realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

3241
02:29:43.461 --> 02:29:45.860
<v Speaker 6>carbs aren't coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to need to burn fats,</v>

3242
02:29:46.100 --> 02:29:51.100
<v Speaker 6>which it has as a sort of a go to way </v>
<v Speaker 6>like we've been eating fats and people </v>

3243
02:29:52.161 --> 02:29:54.970
<v Speaker 6>have been relying on fats forever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not a negative thing.</v>

3244
02:29:54.980 --> 02:29:57.380
<v Speaker 6>Like people have this idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>brain relies only on.</v>

3245
02:29:57.470 --> 02:30:02.470
<v Speaker 6>You have any kind of carbs at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You had to get past a certain amount of </v>

3246
02:30:02.470 --> 02:30:02.990
<v Speaker 6>time or like these are people have just </v>
<v Speaker 6>given that up forever.</v>

3247
02:30:03.020 --> 02:30:04.550
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can have some carbs.</v>

3248
02:30:04.610 --> 02:30:08.060
<v Speaker 6>Your body has a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 6>flexibility to it,</v>

3249
02:30:08.061 --> 02:30:13.061
<v Speaker 6>but the way they've done it well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here's a perfect example of how much </v>

3250
02:30:13.061 --> 02:30:17.051
<v Speaker 6>biodiversity or this when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 6>your body's ability to absorb </v>

3251
02:30:17.051 --> 02:30:17.330
<v Speaker 6>carbohydrates and how it reacts.</v>

3252
02:30:17.720 --> 02:30:22.700
<v Speaker 6>I'm Rob Wolf who was a a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a a scientist and a big paleo researcher</v>

3253
02:30:22.701 --> 02:30:27.701
<v Speaker 6>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's got an interesting instagram page </v>

3254
02:30:27.701 --> 02:30:27.701
<v Speaker 6>and on his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's Das.</v>

3255
02:30:27.701 --> 02:30:31.850
<v Speaker 6>Robb wolf is instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what he does is he'll eat something </v>

3256
02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:36.050
<v Speaker 6>and they'll have his wife eat something </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then they'll do these tests,</v>

3257
02:30:37.250 --> 02:30:42.250
<v Speaker 6>blood tests to find out where their </v>
<v Speaker 6>ketones are and whether or not they're </v>

3258
02:30:42.250 --> 02:30:46.181
<v Speaker 6>in a ketogenic state and his body's way </v>
<v Speaker 6>more fragile in terms of like it's </v>

3259
02:30:46.400 --> 02:30:48.890
<v Speaker 6>getting knocked off a ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then his wife's body,</v>

3260
02:30:49.420 --> 02:30:50.990
<v Speaker 6>his wife just rebounds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Better choices,</v>

3261
02:30:50.991 --> 02:30:53.290
<v Speaker 6>better genetics for it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's pretty cool.</v>

3262
02:30:53.440 --> 02:30:55.040
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they obviously lived together eating the</v>

3263
02:30:55.041 --> 02:30:56.500
<v Speaker 6>same foods,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's,</v>

3264
02:30:56.870 --> 02:31:01.870
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of variables involved in </v>
<v Speaker 6>how your body processes carbs and it </v>

3265
02:31:01.870 --> 02:31:02.480
<v Speaker 6>could,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3266
02:31:02.481 --> 02:31:05.870
<v Speaker 6>it's like some people have celiacs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some people are gluten sensitive,</v>

3267
02:31:05.871 --> 02:31:06.920
<v Speaker 6>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3268
02:31:07.160 --> 02:31:12.160
<v Speaker 6>some people have no problem eating a big</v>
<v Speaker 6>bowl of rice and they stay in Ketosis </v>

3269
02:31:12.160 --> 02:31:16.360
<v Speaker 6>and with some people that just knocks </v>
<v Speaker 6>them right out of it and the body goes </v>

3270
02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:19.271
<v Speaker 6>right back to burning carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It depends also on how strict you've </v>

3271
02:31:19.271 --> 02:31:20.010
<v Speaker 6>been in the Ketogenic Diet and how long </v>
<v Speaker 6>you've done</v>

3272
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:25.010
<v Speaker 1>it for free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of critics of that </v>

3273
02:31:25.010 --> 02:31:26.871
<v Speaker 1>diet too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that cry </v>

3274
02:31:26.871 --> 02:31:26.871
<v Speaker 1>bullshit on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're crying.</v>

3275
02:31:26.871 --> 02:31:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I think some of the people that cry </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit though,</v>

3276
02:31:28.231 --> 02:31:30.680
<v Speaker 1>they don't really have much of a science</v>
<v Speaker 1>background and they're just.</v>

3277
02:31:30.750 --> 02:31:35.750
<v Speaker 1>They're just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There also been a certain way I can buy </v>

3278
02:31:35.750 --> 02:31:38.930
<v Speaker 1>three things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to stick as close as I could to </v>

3279
02:31:38.930 --> 02:31:41.511
<v Speaker 1>the ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it probably wasn't a ketogenic diet </v>

3280
02:31:41.511 --> 02:31:41.880
<v Speaker 1>was just basically making sure that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't eating any sugar,</v>

3281
02:31:42.120 --> 02:31:45.330
<v Speaker 1>any fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any carbs that I know that I know of.</v>

3282
02:31:46.440 --> 02:31:51.440
<v Speaker 1>I was eating within a 10 hour window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if I got up at 10:00</v>

3283
02:31:52.020 --> 02:31:57.020
<v Speaker 1>AM and I had anything to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't eat anything after eight and I </v>

3284
02:31:57.020 --> 02:31:58.350
<v Speaker 1>was trying to work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3285
02:31:58.351 --> 02:32:00.810
<v Speaker 1>do something for an hour a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

3286
02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:03.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great combination of mostly key</v>

3287
02:32:03.261 --> 02:32:06.140
<v Speaker 1>to genic or ketogenic and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3288
02:32:06.960 --> 02:32:11.960
<v Speaker 1>the fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is intermittent </v>

3289
02:32:11.960 --> 02:32:13.140
<v Speaker 1>fasting by going 14 hours every day </v>
<v Speaker 1>without eating.</v>

3290
02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:16.380
<v Speaker 1>That apparently is a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>protocol for losing weight.</v>

3291
02:32:16.381 --> 02:32:17.760
<v Speaker 1>And I've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

3292
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:20.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes me feel good to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puts your body in a good place.</v>

3293
02:32:20.971 --> 02:32:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Your body gets accustomed to only eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>for eight hours a day and then the other</v>

3294
02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:29.100
<v Speaker 1>hours you just don't eat just normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

3295
02:32:29.310 --> 02:32:31.110
<v Speaker 1>16 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just know eating.</v>

3296
02:32:32.420 --> 02:32:35.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one for most people it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

3297
02:32:35.011 --> 02:32:36.270
<v Speaker 1>But especially on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3298
02:32:36.271 --> 02:32:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm having to eat after I perform and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3299
02:32:38.311 --> 02:32:43.311
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means I can't eat until the </v>

3300
02:32:43.311 --> 02:32:43.311
<v Speaker 1>afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't fuck with it on the road,</v>

3301
02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:48.440
<v Speaker 1>on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most important thing to me is a </v>

3302
02:32:48.440 --> 02:32:48.440
<v Speaker 1>nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're sleep and recovery,</v>

3303
02:32:48.440 --> 02:32:52.791
<v Speaker 1>sleep and exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I don't exercise when I'm on the </v>

3304
02:32:52.791 --> 02:32:52.830
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get off because uh,</v>

3305
02:32:52.890 --> 02:32:54.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flying and everything,</v>

3306
02:32:54.331 --> 02:32:59.331
<v Speaker 1>I feel like your body needs to exert in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to release endorphins and sorta </v>

3307
02:32:59.331 --> 02:32:59.460
<v Speaker 1>like that's why as soon as I walked in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the door here,</v>

3308
02:32:59.461 --> 02:33:04.461
<v Speaker 1>I grabbed the Kettlebell because I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't been able to do any of that </v>

3309
02:33:04.461 --> 02:33:04.461
<v Speaker 1>stuff for a minute.</v>

3310
02:33:04.461 --> 02:33:08.000
<v Speaker 1>And so I've been here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been in basically on my back for the </v>

3311
02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:11.601
<v Speaker 1>last three days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got some weird stomach thing or don't </v>

3312
02:33:11.601 --> 02:33:14.580
<v Speaker 1>have a bad piece of baked brie or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and like knives and my stomach</v>

3313
02:33:14.581 --> 02:33:17.970
<v Speaker 1>for two days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a dowery blaming on cheese.</v>

3314
02:33:17.971 --> 02:33:19.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm blaming it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to blame it on you,</v>

3315
02:33:19.951 --> 02:33:24.951
<v Speaker 1>but I just got here though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't blame it on code js code pay </v>

3316
02:33:24.951 --> 02:33:29.680
<v Speaker 1>for Bri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk to bake bread again </v>

3317
02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:30.630
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you one of those raw cheese guys?</v>

3318
02:33:30.720 --> 02:33:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Do you prefer the raw cheese?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3319
02:33:33.780 --> 02:33:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like cheese.</v>

3320
02:33:34.951 --> 02:33:36.930
<v Speaker 1>I try not to eat a lot of it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because again,</v>

3321
02:33:36.931 --> 02:33:39.540
<v Speaker 1>anything that's too much of anything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>

3322
02:33:39.541 --> 02:33:40.650
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

3323
02:33:40.651 --> 02:33:44.610
<v Speaker 1>But what I've found is that raw milk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>raw cheese in particular,</v>

3324
02:33:44.611 --> 02:33:49.611
<v Speaker 1>both those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I seem to digest them way easier than I </v>

3325
02:33:49.611 --> 02:33:49.611
<v Speaker 1>do the pasteurized and homogenized </v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

3326
02:33:49.680 --> 02:33:50.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are you,</v>

3327
02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:51.910
<v Speaker 1>how are you getting it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you getting it?</v>

3328
02:33:52.390 --> 02:33:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I actually have that in the US because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get raw cheese at whole foods.</v>

3329
02:33:57.900 --> 02:33:58.830
<v Speaker 1>There's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3330
02:33:58.831 --> 02:34:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can get the foreign.</v>

3331
02:34:01.110 --> 02:34:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like they actually making cheese in </v>

3332
02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:06.110
<v Speaker 1>the US.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

3333
02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Is an awful hurdle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>

3334
02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they want you to pasteurize </v>

3335
02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.430
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like cheese in the US isn't nearly as </v>

3336
02:34:13.430 --> 02:34:16.070
<v Speaker 1>wonderful and tasty is that is a firm in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cs just because of all the process </v>

3337
02:34:16.681 --> 02:34:18.060
<v Speaker 1>that you've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like raw</v>

3338
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:19.930
<v Speaker 5>stuff from a farm and go check it out.</v>

3339
02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:22.680
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have burrata cheese in Italy and I was</v>

3340
02:34:22.681 --> 02:34:24.660
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do I get this home?</v>

3341
02:34:24.930 --> 02:34:26.280
<v Speaker 6>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You move to Italy,</v>

3342
02:34:26.810 --> 02:34:31.810
<v Speaker 6>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Could you even take Berata on an </v>

3343
02:34:31.810 --> 02:34:31.810
<v Speaker 6>airplane?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Would they let you.</v>

3344
02:34:31.810 --> 02:34:33.510
<v Speaker 6>They might not write,</v>
<v Speaker 6>smuggle it.</v>

3345
02:34:33.810 --> 02:34:38.810
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had a friend who was French and he </v>

3346
02:34:38.810 --> 02:34:39.120
<v Speaker 6>came picturing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right little little balloon.</v>

3347
02:34:39.300 --> 02:34:44.300
<v Speaker 6>I had a friend who was French from </v>
<v Speaker 6>France and he had to hide his cheese </v>

3348
02:34:44.300 --> 02:34:45.570
<v Speaker 6>because he had raw cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He had a hide it in his luggage,</v>

3349
02:34:45.810 --> 02:34:48.150
<v Speaker 6>so you have to like folded up inside his</v>
<v Speaker 6>pants.</v>

3350
02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:53.240
<v Speaker 6>Like these bricks have wheels of cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He had to like put his parents are </v>

3351
02:34:53.240 --> 02:34:55.920
<v Speaker 6>stuffed in his luggage to hide cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They make it back and she's made it back</v>

3352
02:34:55.921 --> 02:34:56.940
<v Speaker 6>in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3353
02:34:57.480 --> 02:35:00.510
<v Speaker 6>he was his name and his address.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't tell you can't tell you.</v>

3354
02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:02.400
<v Speaker 6>He actually moved back to France.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

3355
02:35:02.401 --> 02:35:05.970
<v Speaker 6>fuck this place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But when he lived here they used to make</v>

3356
02:35:05.971 --> 02:35:10.971
<v Speaker 6>this raw cheese and like charcuterie </v>
<v Speaker 6>plate.</v>

3357
02:35:11.161 --> 02:35:15.780
<v Speaker 6>They would like cook raw cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 6>melted on the different smoked meats and</v>

3358
02:35:15.810 --> 02:35:17.640
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I forget the name of it,</v>

3359
02:35:17.790 --> 02:35:22.790
<v Speaker 6>the name of the dish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it was sensational and they would </v>

3360
02:35:22.790 --> 02:35:25.491
<v Speaker 6>eat it with like Sauerkraut,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the art of eating you out of eating and </v>

3361
02:35:26.641 --> 02:35:28.950
<v Speaker 6>food to real art.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3362
02:35:29.070 --> 02:35:30.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3363
02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:32.220
<v Speaker 5>I think the trick when you get into </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3364
02:35:32.221 --> 02:35:35.880
<v Speaker 5>you start getting into that gluttonous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a activity with your,</v>

3365
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:38.070
<v Speaker 5>with your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with your world eeo.</v>

3366
02:35:38.760 --> 02:35:43.760
<v Speaker 5>It's the moderation part because you get</v>
<v Speaker 5>caught up in like Morris better and </v>

3367
02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:47.600
<v Speaker 5>cramming it in and just being able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>slow down and actually enjoy those </v>

3368
02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:48.010
<v Speaker 5>experiences without just,</v>

3369
02:35:48.850 --> 02:35:50.630
<v Speaker 6>without going full blown.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gerard,</v>

3370
02:35:50.910 --> 02:35:55.910
<v Speaker 6>you put,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if he put like a plate of prosciutto in </v>

3371
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:58.411
<v Speaker 6>front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm fucked for a week because I'll eat </v>

3372
02:35:58.411 --> 02:35:58.411
<v Speaker 6>all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I to.</v>

3373
02:35:58.411 --> 02:35:59.260
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I eat that stuff a lot because it's,</v>

3374
02:35:59.261 --> 02:36:01.930
<v Speaker 6>it's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like if you get like real good,</v>

3375
02:36:01.931 --> 02:36:05.560
<v Speaker 6>naturally cured,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get lots of healthy fats from it.</v>

3376
02:36:05.910 --> 02:36:09.310
<v Speaker 6>So it's a great way to get a little </v>
<v Speaker 6>package of protein.</v>

3377
02:36:09.311 --> 02:36:11.380
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just open it up and dig in there.</v>

3378
02:36:11.381 --> 02:36:14.230
<v Speaker 6>That's a good key to genic snack.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did that one.</v>

3379
02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:19.120
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always recommend MERC systems book the</v>

3380
02:36:19.121 --> 02:36:24.121
<v Speaker 6>primal blueprint and he's the guy though</v>
<v Speaker 6>that came on the podcast and apparently </v>

3381
02:36:24.121 --> 02:36:25.590
<v Speaker 6>he's incorrect about some wine stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was wondering.</v>

3382
02:36:26.430 --> 02:36:27.790
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what did he say he sending?</v>

3383
02:36:27.850 --> 02:36:29.120
<v Speaker 6>Talking about Kevin Vernon</v>

3384
02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:31.190
<v Speaker 5>wine and he made some mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3385
02:36:31.220 --> 02:36:36.220
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a lot of misconceptions </v>

3386
02:36:36.220 --> 02:36:37.070
<v Speaker 5>about winemaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>commercial,</v>

3387
02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:38.840
<v Speaker 5>large scale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why making.</v>

3388
02:36:38.841 --> 02:36:40.910
<v Speaker 5>I've seen a lot of things happen in </v>
<v Speaker 5>sellers,</v>

3389
02:36:40.911 --> 02:36:43.370
<v Speaker 5>large scale sellers that are cutting </v>
<v Speaker 5>corners.</v>

3390
02:36:43.371 --> 02:36:45.320
<v Speaker 5>It's just a lot of things that they have</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do,</v>

3391
02:36:45.321 --> 02:36:49.700
<v Speaker 5>but there's this idea that there's all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these things that we're adding to our,</v>

3392
02:36:50.090 --> 02:36:53.090
<v Speaker 5>to our wines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>give you headaches and fuck you up.</v>

3393
02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:54.170
<v Speaker 5>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3394
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:57.050
<v Speaker 5>in our vineyard we do have copper sprays</v>
<v Speaker 5>and things that are kind of a,</v>

3395
02:36:57.130 --> 02:37:01.250
<v Speaker 5>we're avoiding a frost or we're avoiding</v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch rot.</v>

3396
02:37:01.530 --> 02:37:03.320
<v Speaker 5>A copper sprays.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3397
02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:04.260
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3398
02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:05.450
<v Speaker 5>it's a long story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3399
02:37:05.930 --> 02:37:08.830
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's organic stuff we're trying to do to</v>

3400
02:37:09.110 --> 02:37:11.000
<v Speaker 5>address the actual copper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3401
02:37:11.001 --> 02:37:14.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure if it's actual copper or </v>
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>

3402
02:37:14.030 --> 02:37:15.800
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine it's no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

3403
02:37:16.410 --> 02:37:17.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3404
02:37:17.630 --> 02:37:22.630
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's just something that you're </v>

3405
02:37:22.630 --> 02:37:25.621
<v Speaker 5>doing in the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the vineyard that are kind of like a </v>

3406
02:37:25.621 --> 02:37:29.200
<v Speaker 5>organic practices that are acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but one of the things when the fruit </v>

3407
02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:32.190
<v Speaker 5>actually gets to the winery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3408
02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:36.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm inoculating it with a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a pro,</v>

3409
02:37:37.100 --> 02:37:39.890
<v Speaker 5>a packaged yeast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so something that might be an isolate is</v>

3410
02:37:39.891 --> 02:37:42.410
<v Speaker 5>trained from Barolo or from Tuscany.</v>

3411
02:37:43.070 --> 02:37:44.840
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but other than that,</v>

3412
02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:50.200
<v Speaker 5>at the end of the process,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll add a kms and so to solution to,</v>

3413
02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:56.380
<v Speaker 5>to stabilize the wine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to keep it bottled with safe in the </v>

3414
02:37:56.380 --> 02:37:56.380
<v Speaker 5>bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what does kms stand for?</v>

3415
02:37:56.380 --> 02:37:59.390
<v Speaker 5>Sulfur where we actually were salt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're adding sulfites to the wine,</v>

3416
02:38:00.020 --> 02:38:03.980
<v Speaker 5>but wine itself actually produces.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those byproducts were just,</v>

3417
02:38:04.310 --> 02:38:08.570
<v Speaker 5>were just escalating it to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 5>that this wine can make it on a truck to</v>

3418
02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:12.440
<v Speaker 5>New Jersey or to whatever and they blow </v>
<v Speaker 5>off that go away.</v>

3419
02:38:12.770 --> 02:38:16.220
<v Speaker 5>So that's A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3420
02:38:16.221 --> 02:38:21.221
<v Speaker 5>Basically just kind of preserves it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And some places that are paranoid about </v>

3421
02:38:21.291 --> 02:38:23.920
<v Speaker 5>where that wine is going and how long </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be sitting in a truck.</v>

3422
02:38:23.930 --> 02:38:25.370
<v Speaker 5>And maybe it's not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>refrigerated.</v>

3423
02:38:25.610 --> 02:38:30.610
<v Speaker 5>They're probably adding a little bit too</v>
<v Speaker 5>much and there's some places that are </v>

3424
02:38:30.610 --> 02:38:30.610
<v Speaker 5>actually adding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3425
02:38:30.610 --> 02:38:31.700
<v Speaker 5>other weird stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3426
02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:35.270
<v Speaker 5>enzymes and stuff into their wines and </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the process.</v>

3427
02:38:35.270 --> 02:38:39.620
<v Speaker 5>But in my cellar it's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the yeast holes,</v>

3428
02:38:39.621 --> 02:38:44.621
<v Speaker 5>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the yeast and at the end it's </v>

3429
02:38:44.621 --> 02:38:44.830
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not doing any other weird added.</v>

3430
02:38:44.831 --> 02:38:49.831
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the idea that there's like all these </v>

3431
02:38:49.831 --> 02:38:52.000
<v Speaker 5>chemicals and all these extra things </v>
<v Speaker 5>were jamming and do our wines is </v>

3432
02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:53.240
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's just a misconception.</v>

3433
02:38:53.450 --> 02:38:54.140
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3434
02:38:54.190 --> 02:38:56.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but are there any wine companies that do</v>

3435
02:38:56.271 --> 02:38:57.200
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure,</v>

3436
02:38:57.230 --> 02:38:58.250
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of stuff.</v>

3437
02:38:58.251 --> 02:38:59.180
<v Speaker 5>People that are adding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3438
02:38:59.210 --> 02:39:01.790
<v Speaker 5>they're adding a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they call mega purple.</v>

3439
02:39:01.791 --> 02:39:04.220
<v Speaker 5>They're adding like tannins and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>adding color and the wood is,</v>

3440
02:39:04.300 --> 02:39:09.300
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so adding like weird nutrients on this </v>

3441
02:39:09.300 --> 02:39:09.300
<v Speaker 5>end and wording,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3442
02:39:09.300 --> 02:39:10.940
<v Speaker 5>while we have nutrients on that end and </v>
<v Speaker 5>some nitrogen on this end,</v>

3443
02:39:10.941 --> 02:39:11.260
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3444
02:39:11.261 --> 02:39:14.720
<v Speaker 5>they're adding a lot of extra stuff in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the process that,</v>

3445
02:39:15.020 --> 02:39:20.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't do it because we're doing very </v>

3446
02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:22.661
<v Speaker 5>small batches of things and then they </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't have to alert people what they're </v>

3447
02:39:22.661 --> 02:39:22.661
<v Speaker 5>putting in either.</v>

3448
02:39:22.661 --> 02:39:22.661
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just wine.</v>

3449
02:39:22.661 --> 02:39:24.830
<v Speaker 5>You get a bottle one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you assume it's just wine.</v>

3450
02:39:25.370 --> 02:39:26.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3451
02:39:26.670 --> 02:39:31.670
<v Speaker 5>I think that's changing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the FDA's threatening to stick </v>

3452
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:31.670
<v Speaker 5>their nose into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3453
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:33.320
<v Speaker 5>into wineries now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a pain in the ass,</v>

3454
02:39:34.110 --> 02:39:39.110
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want to know where everything's </v>

3455
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:39.670
<v Speaker 5>coming from and going to and really all </v>
<v Speaker 5>the shit that's going on.</v>

3456
02:39:39.690 --> 02:39:42.840
<v Speaker 5>You can deal with a group over move </v>
<v Speaker 5>books.</v>

3457
02:39:42.870 --> 02:39:44.030
<v Speaker 5>The one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3458
02:39:44.060 --> 02:39:47.710
<v Speaker 5>we're going to moon pool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for you're new,</v>

3459
02:39:47.770 --> 02:39:52.770
<v Speaker 5>you're just doing for the last 3000 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years they were adding husks.</v>

3460
02:39:53.961 --> 02:39:57.560
<v Speaker 5>Bookton ruin the diva.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What husks we're.</v>

3461
02:39:59.570 --> 02:40:00.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3462
02:40:00.380 --> 02:40:04.700
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so when you're,</v>

3463
02:40:04.730 --> 02:40:09.730
<v Speaker 5>when you're adding the stuff to the wine</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you say that it burns off like </v>

3464
02:40:09.730 --> 02:40:12.530
<v Speaker 5>you're adding sulfites are sulfate </v>
<v Speaker 5>sulfur softening software just as a,</v>

3465
02:40:12.531 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 5>as a preserve,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there</v>

3466
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:16.200
<v Speaker 6>an ideal?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Was off I should say?</v>

3467
02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:18.570
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you bottle of wine,</v>

3468
02:40:18.571 --> 02:40:22.500
<v Speaker 6>is there an ideal time after you borrow </v>
<v Speaker 6>that wine where it should be consumed?</v>

3469
02:40:23.950 --> 02:40:28.950
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you can bottle it the minute you </v>

3470
02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:29.230
<v Speaker 5>can open up to the minute it's bottle if</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to,</v>

3471
02:40:29.290 --> 02:40:30.250
<v Speaker 5>if you want to open it up.</v>

3472
02:40:30.370 --> 02:40:32.910
<v Speaker 6>But this era,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where does the,</v>

3473
02:40:33.250 --> 02:40:35.170
<v Speaker 6>like when we drank that wind from like </v>
<v Speaker 6>19,</v>

3474
02:40:35.171 --> 02:40:38.830
<v Speaker 6>24 or whatever the fuck it was that good</v>
<v Speaker 6>or is that different?</v>

3475
02:40:39.250 --> 02:40:39.730
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's like</v>

3476
02:40:39.780 --> 02:40:43.050
<v Speaker 5>it's all good wine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a long conversation,</v>

3477
02:40:43.051 --> 02:40:45.720
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>winds in theory,</v>

3478
02:40:45.721 --> 02:40:50.721
<v Speaker 5>there's places that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that just the natural structure of that </v>

3479
02:40:50.721 --> 02:40:50.721
<v Speaker 5>place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Ph,</v>

3480
02:40:50.721 --> 02:40:55.230
<v Speaker 5>the asset balances of those places and </v>
<v Speaker 5>depending on how well or not.</v>

3481
02:40:55.231 --> 02:41:00.231
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wine maker got out of the way to </v>

3482
02:41:00.231 --> 02:41:00.231
<v Speaker 5>make sure that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that one,</v>

3483
02:41:00.231 --> 02:41:00.660
<v Speaker 5>that wine made it into a bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was proper,</v>

3484
02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:01.930
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3485
02:41:02.010 --> 02:41:03.270
<v Speaker 5>the storage of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

3486
02:41:03.460 --> 02:41:04.530
<v Speaker 5>the Cork,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how that,</v>

3487
02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:05.940
<v Speaker 5>how that went.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so many,</v>

3488
02:41:05.941 --> 02:41:07.350
<v Speaker 5>so many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so many variables,</v>

3489
02:41:07.860 --> 02:41:12.860
<v Speaker 5>but when you're talking about the track </v>
<v Speaker 5>record of a particular site and a </v>

3490
02:41:12.860 --> 02:41:14.130
<v Speaker 5>producer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3491
02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:15.480
<v Speaker 5>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3492
02:41:16.340 --> 02:41:19.200
<v Speaker 5>there are wines that you just expect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I'm going to buy this Latour,</v>

3493
02:41:19.201 --> 02:41:24.201
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to buy a this fine burgundy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You expected that wine has been held to </v>

3494
02:41:25.111 --> 02:41:29.520
<v Speaker 5>a standard for a long period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like all throughout decades,</v>

3495
02:41:29.550 --> 02:41:31.000
<v Speaker 5>millennia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3496
02:41:31.050 --> 02:41:32.760
<v Speaker 5>they have been consistent.</v>

3497
02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:38.000
<v Speaker 5>So you expect that I should be able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>lay this wind down for 50 years and it </v>

3498
02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.920
<v Speaker 5>should be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'll be different in 50 years.</v>

3499
02:41:41.210 --> 02:41:43.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm provided none of those other </v>
<v Speaker 5>variables.</v>

3500
02:41:44.010 --> 02:41:47.430
<v Speaker 5>Like somebody didn't pull it out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>leave it on the counter in the sun for a</v>

3501
02:41:47.431 --> 02:41:50.160
<v Speaker 5>week and then put it back on the seller </v>
<v Speaker 5>and 50 years later you open it.</v>

3502
02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:53.520
<v Speaker 5>It's crap all would take off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3503
02:41:53.530 --> 02:41:55.740
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the heater sun itself.</v>

3504
02:41:57.570 --> 02:41:59.850
<v Speaker 5>It could be cold,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could be something that goes to,</v>

3505
02:41:59.851 --> 02:42:01.380
<v Speaker 5>gets too cold,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it gets too dry.</v>

3506
02:42:01.381 --> 02:42:05.130
<v Speaker 5>The cork dries out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It leaks that oxygen gets in a heat.</v>

3507
02:42:05.131 --> 02:42:08.130
<v Speaker 5>Is your enemy is your enemy oxygen as </v>
<v Speaker 5>your enemy,</v>

3508
02:42:08.230 --> 02:42:12.300
<v Speaker 6>so as long as it's treated correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it could last a long time and it'll just</v>

3509
02:42:12.310 --> 02:42:13.140
<v Speaker 6>change and</v>

3510
02:42:13.390 --> 02:42:13.870
<v Speaker 5>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3511
02:42:13.871 --> 02:42:17.470
<v Speaker 5>it'll evolve over time and it will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's definitely an art to it.</v>

3512
02:42:17.471 --> 02:42:18.580
<v Speaker 5>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's definitely like,</v>

3513
02:42:18.581 --> 02:42:19.150
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3514
02:42:19.210 --> 02:42:21.790
<v Speaker 5>that particular wine was ready to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a peak,</v>

3515
02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:23.590
<v Speaker 5>that's the shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drank it.</v>

3516
02:42:23.591 --> 02:42:24.070
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then</v>

3517
02:42:24.180 --> 02:42:29.180
<v Speaker 6>how do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you know from reading like articles </v>

3518
02:42:29.180 --> 02:42:29.180
<v Speaker 6>or</v>

3519
02:42:29.180 --> 02:42:29.180
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3520
02:42:29.180 --> 02:42:29.640
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3521
02:42:29.970 --> 02:42:34.140
<v Speaker 5>it's some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why I buy some guys buy a case or</v>

3522
02:42:34.141 --> 02:42:39.141
<v Speaker 5>two cases of wine that they know they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to like and they're trying them </v>

3523
02:42:39.141 --> 02:42:42.591
<v Speaker 5>over time and they're figuring it out </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they'll have that wine and </v>

3524
02:42:42.591 --> 02:42:43.110
<v Speaker 5>they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey guys,</v>

3525
02:42:43.111 --> 02:42:48.111
<v Speaker 5>I just had a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the 10th bottle of wine from those 24 </v>

3526
02:42:48.111 --> 02:42:51.270
<v Speaker 5>bottles and it's starting to go over the</v>
<v Speaker 5>hill.</v>

3527
02:42:51.810 --> 02:42:54.540
<v Speaker 5>So there's a little forum or somebody to</v>
<v Speaker 5>call on each other back and forth going,</v>

3528
02:42:54.541 --> 02:42:56.700
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this particular wine is,</v>

3529
02:42:56.730 --> 02:42:58.110
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

3530
02:42:58.140 --> 02:43:00.450
<v Speaker 5>has seen its best day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3531
02:43:00.510 --> 02:43:02.160
<v Speaker 5>and they'll get back online and somebody</v>
<v Speaker 5>will go,</v>

3532
02:43:02.370 --> 02:43:03.300
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mine's fire.</v>

3533
02:43:03.301 --> 02:43:04.950
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the arguments about that.</v>

3534
02:43:04.951 --> 02:43:09.951
<v Speaker 5>But generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's that communication of guys saying </v>

3535
02:43:09.951 --> 02:43:09.951
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting.</v>

3536
02:43:09.951 --> 02:43:12.100
<v Speaker 6>So it requires like a community of</v>

3537
02:43:12.100 --> 02:43:15.220
<v Speaker 1>knowledgeable people to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

3538
02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy of mine,</v>

3539
02:43:16.871 --> 02:43:20.710
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking total wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not invited me to his birthday party and</v>

3540
02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:24.610
<v Speaker 1>it was a wine tasting birthday party and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all sitting around like.</v>

3541
02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:27.130
<v Speaker 1>And they would judge the wine </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

3542
02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:31.210
<v Speaker 1>It's very oaky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's hints of Tannin and I'd be like,</v>

3543
02:43:31.211 --> 02:43:36.211
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck are you guys take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of them that they didn't like </v>

3544
02:43:36.211 --> 02:43:36.211
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one's corked.</v>

3545
02:43:36.211 --> 02:43:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I think this one's corked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

3546
02:43:37.780 --> 02:43:40.030
<v Speaker 1>this one's my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked this one.</v>

3547
02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:41.710
<v Speaker 1>You tell me it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is bad.</v>

3548
02:43:41.740 --> 02:43:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Like cows it bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you know it's bad?</v>

3549
02:43:44.380 --> 02:43:48.130
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's corked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do,</v>

3550
02:43:48.420 --> 02:43:50.470
<v Speaker 1>does that drive you crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're super busy.</v>

3551
02:43:51.850 --> 02:43:54.490
<v Speaker 1>So there's like a level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretentiousness that's acceptable.</v>

3552
02:43:55.030 --> 02:43:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to kind,</v>

3553
02:43:57.130 --> 02:44:00.700
<v Speaker 1>trying find their way in life and try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find what makes them better than,</v>

3554
02:44:00.701 --> 02:44:04.000
<v Speaker 1>or different than or separates them or </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevates them because pallets.</v>

3555
02:44:04.001 --> 02:44:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Palette is incredible.</v>

3556
02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:10.120
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be able to tell when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>ties it and you get some fat ass.</v>

3557
02:44:10.300 --> 02:44:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Orson Welles dude sitting there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you know,</v>

3559
02:44:16.030 --> 02:44:18.880
<v Speaker 1>after a couple of classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that thing's not really torqued,</v>

3560
02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:20.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm drinking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3561
02:44:20.770 --> 02:44:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially after a couple of glasses.</v>

3562
02:44:23.710 --> 02:44:26.500
<v Speaker 1>In the olden days they used to drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>wine because water would go bad,</v>

3563
02:44:26.501 --> 02:44:27.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3564
02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:28.610
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the,</v>

3565
02:44:29.130 --> 02:44:33.040
<v Speaker 1>well still water sit around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would still water.</v>

3566
02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:34.450
<v Speaker 1>But also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3567
02:44:34.570 --> 02:44:39.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3569
02:44:39.570 --> 02:44:41.980
<v Speaker 1>like New Orleans complete devastation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

3570
02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:47.160
<v Speaker 1>of the water table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like decomposing bodies </v>

3571
02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:48.010
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and you can't drink the </v>
<v Speaker 1>groundwater.</v>

3572
02:44:48.011 --> 02:44:49.630
<v Speaker 1>You can't trust what's coming out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>

3573
02:44:49.631 --> 02:44:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3574
02:44:50.710 --> 02:44:55.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fermented fermented juice is what you </v>

3575
02:44:55.710 --> 02:44:57.780
<v Speaker 1>would drink if it's safe because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone through fermentation process.</v>

3576
02:44:57.790 --> 02:45:00.700
<v Speaker 1>A process of purification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like vodka.</v>

3577
02:45:00.701 --> 02:45:01.960
<v Speaker 1>The water of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3578
02:45:01.990 --> 02:45:04.630
<v Speaker 1>it's the water that doesn't freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can go through the Tundra.</v>

3579
02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:07.150
<v Speaker 1>If you had an eat snow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to freeze to death.</v>

3580
02:45:07.540 --> 02:45:09.700
<v Speaker 1>If you try to like melt the snow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're building.</v>

3581
02:45:09.701 --> 02:45:14.701
<v Speaker 1>If you do have a fire but they actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>water of vodka doesn't freeze and you </v>

3582
02:45:14.701 --> 02:45:19.651
<v Speaker 1>can actually survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have water while you're </v>

3583
02:45:19.651 --> 02:45:22.080
<v Speaker 1>walking through this frozen Tundra and </v>
<v Speaker 1>get the benefit of being drunk all the </v>

3584
02:45:22.080 --> 02:45:23.070
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drunk as fuck in a snowbank yeah.</v>

3585
02:45:23.071 --> 02:45:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Like Vikings had a big ass leather sack </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3587
02:45:28.390 --> 02:45:31.210

<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

3588
02:45:31.470 --> 02:45:36.430
<v Speaker 1>They're drunk all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's eating mushrooms and Reagan made.</v>

3589
02:45:36.940 --> 02:45:39.190
<v Speaker 1>That's wind or that's what it's made out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3594
02:45:44.171 --> 02:45:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Because it doesn't go bad ever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in honey and they just stay good.</v>

3598
02:45:51.670 --> 02:45:54.760
<v Speaker 1>They think that's one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>led to the iphone five.</v>

3599
02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Is it work good on honey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

3600
02:45:57.041 --> 02:46:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Still preserved as looking at different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still use an iphone five.</v>

3601
02:46:00.730 --> 02:46:02.770
<v Speaker 1>You one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the iphone six.</v>

3602
02:46:02.950 --> 02:46:04.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have a,</v>

3603
02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:08.440
<v Speaker 1>you have a port for the headphones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone port.</v>

3604
02:46:08.500 --> 02:46:11.650
<v Speaker 1>So we stopped changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where we draw the line.</v>

3605
02:46:11.651 --> 02:46:16.651
<v Speaker 1>I draw the line and they had from port.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people do like that's where I </v>

3606
02:46:16.651 --> 02:46:16.890
<v Speaker 1>draw the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

3607
02:46:17.210 --> 02:46:18.310
<v Speaker 1>so meade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3608
02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:23.320
<v Speaker 1>like I'd read something where they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculating that one of the conversions </v>

3609
02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:27.851
<v Speaker 1>from mushroom culture to meed cause they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that we used to be like our,</v>

3610
02:46:28.231 --> 02:46:29.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intoxicants.</v>

3611
02:46:29.961 --> 02:46:33.800
<v Speaker 1>We're primarily psychedelic and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they went to alcohol,</v>

3612
02:46:33.950 --> 02:46:38.950
<v Speaker 1>some point in human history and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might've coincided with people </v>

3613
02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:43.211
<v Speaker 1>trying to preserve mushrooms in honey </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they produce some sort of a </v>

3614
02:46:43.211 --> 02:46:46.700
<v Speaker 1>honey mushroom chemical reaction that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the honey actually fermented.</v>

3615
02:46:46.780 --> 02:46:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people started drinking meat </v>

3616
02:46:51.780 --> 02:46:51.970
<v Speaker 1>and then meat culture changed the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3617
02:46:52.070 --> 02:46:54.260
<v Speaker 1>alcohol culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like an aggressive,</v>

3618
02:46:54.860 --> 02:46:55.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loose,</v>

3619
02:46:55.641 --> 02:46:57.950
<v Speaker 1>losing inhibitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild culture.</v>

3620
02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Is there any movement to bring back </v>
<v Speaker 1>those leather wind socks,</v>

3621
02:47:02.690 --> 02:47:03.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

3622
02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:06.290
<v Speaker 1>What are those things called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things that the um,</v>

3623
02:47:06.490 --> 02:47:10.720
<v Speaker 1>that went and the vikings had to carry </v>
<v Speaker 1>him around those leather sacks,</v>

3624
02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:13.460
<v Speaker 1>bladder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wind bladder.</v>

3625
02:47:13.461 --> 02:47:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any benefit to drinking,</v>

3626
02:47:16.930 --> 02:47:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I think I need you to roll in to </v>
<v Speaker 1>augustine wine bar with a fucking </v>

3627
02:47:21.930 --> 02:47:24.020
<v Speaker 1>bladder and a fucking horned helmets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3628
02:47:24.110 --> 02:47:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Drink your ale from one of the day as </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullhorn things.</v>

3629
02:47:28.490 --> 02:47:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Do they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3630
02:47:29.301 --> 02:47:30.260
<v Speaker 1>does anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3631
02:47:30.290 --> 02:47:35.290
<v Speaker 1>serve wine out of like a leather thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would feel like that's like the next </v>

3632
02:47:35.290 --> 02:47:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Mumford and sons should be time to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they do.</v>

3633
02:47:37.371 --> 02:47:42.371
<v Speaker 1>Growler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're walking into a andover was </v>

3634
02:47:42.371 --> 02:47:43.670
<v Speaker 1>a beer bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there allow you to bring in,</v>

3635
02:47:44.290 --> 02:47:49.290
<v Speaker 1>if it's a measured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that volume is and you can refill </v>

3636
02:47:49.290 --> 02:47:49.290
<v Speaker 1>your growler.</v>

3637
02:47:49.290 --> 02:47:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with beer.</v>

3638
02:47:50.570 --> 02:47:52.610
<v Speaker 1>I think some places do the same with </v>
<v Speaker 1>wine.</v>

3639
02:47:53.020 --> 02:47:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big,</v>

3640
02:47:53.540 --> 02:47:56.150
<v Speaker 1>the big issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the labeling.</v>

3641
02:47:56.180 --> 02:47:56.720
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3642
02:47:56.721 --> 02:47:59.630
<v Speaker 1>the ttp gets all weird and the liquor </v>
<v Speaker 1>department gets all weird because like,</v>

3643
02:47:59.631 --> 02:48:03.020
<v Speaker 1>well the bottle has all the labeling on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it that I need to make sure that you're,</v>

3644
02:48:03.190 --> 02:48:05.990
<v Speaker 1>are you pregnant because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>warning on here about that.</v>

3645
02:48:06.430 --> 02:48:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're just coming in and filling </v>

3646
02:48:11.430 --> 02:48:13.451
<v Speaker 1>your growler with wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the assumption is that at some </v>

3647
02:48:13.451 --> 02:48:14.180
<v Speaker 1>point you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3648
02:48:14.210 --> 02:48:15.550
<v Speaker 1>violate the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3649
02:48:15.590 --> 02:48:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3650
02:48:17.270 --> 02:48:18.500
<v Speaker 1>It seems kind of weird to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3651
02:48:18.501 --> 02:48:20.900
<v Speaker 1>just fill up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just let the Guy Philip is thing.</v>

3652
02:48:21.020 --> 02:48:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever thought about </v>
<v Speaker 1>experimenting with like a leather </v>

3653
02:48:26.020 --> 02:48:26.600
<v Speaker 1>bladder for your wine to see if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>influences the taste?</v>

3654
02:48:26.601 --> 02:48:28.490
<v Speaker 1>We did one for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a leather one,</v>

3655
02:48:28.491 --> 02:48:32.060
<v Speaker 1>but did like a plastic one for um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3656
02:48:32.061 --> 02:48:33.740
<v Speaker 1>we do a wine garden.</v>

3657
02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:35.100

<v Speaker 1>rock on the range.</v>

3659
02:48:38.361 --> 02:48:41.090

02:48:44.481 --> 02:48:47.900
<v Speaker 1>We did one down in Florida for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of festivals.</v>

3662
02:48:47.901 --> 02:48:49.970
<v Speaker 1>And does it affect the taste at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>being in that?</v>

3663
02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3664
02:48:50.900 --> 02:48:54.110
<v Speaker 1>well if you're in the middle of a field </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a bunch of shitty bands playing,</v>

3665
02:48:54.140 --> 02:48:55.960
<v Speaker 1>it's going to taste different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3666
02:48:57.250 --> 02:49:00.110
<v Speaker 1>it's hot and you're annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

3667
02:49:00.111 --> 02:49:03.080
<v Speaker 1>it's going to taste different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even drink it because you're annoyed and</v>

3668
02:49:04.010 --> 02:49:09.010
<v Speaker 1>do you have recommended temperatures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your wine should be stored or </v>

3669
02:49:09.010 --> 02:49:09.010
<v Speaker 1>served that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3670
02:49:09.010 --> 02:49:10.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean just normal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A normal seller,</v>

3671
02:49:10.170 --> 02:49:12.370
<v Speaker 5>a seller,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cellaring anyone.</v>

3672
02:49:12.570 --> 02:49:17.570
<v Speaker 5>That'd be nice if you could put it at </v>
<v Speaker 5>like 50 degrees and you're in your wine </v>

3673
02:49:17.570 --> 02:49:19.740
<v Speaker 5>cellar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A good spot for it.</v>

3674
02:49:20.310 --> 02:49:22.610
<v Speaker 5>40 slash 40 slash $45.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what you want,</v>

3675
02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:25.350
<v Speaker 5>but you don't want to put in your fridge</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's going to get too cold.</v>

3676
02:49:25.450 --> 02:49:26.820
<v Speaker 5>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's,</v>

3677
02:49:26.821 --> 02:49:28.380
<v Speaker 5>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to drink it fairly right</v>

3678
02:49:28.381 --> 02:49:29.610
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you go to the store and you got to,</v>

3679
02:49:29.670 --> 02:49:34.670
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get a bottle of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to cram in the fridge for the </v>

3680
02:49:34.670 --> 02:49:34.670
<v Speaker 5>day to open it up that night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>

3681
02:49:34.670 --> 02:49:36.180
<v Speaker 5>But if you store your wine in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fridge,</v>

3682
02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:38.230
<v Speaker 5>that's a little too cold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3683
02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:40.350
<v Speaker 5>be storing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've done that before.</v>

3684
02:49:40.410 --> 02:49:43.180
<v Speaker 5>But it's better than leaving it out in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on top of your fish.</v>

3685
02:49:43.181 --> 02:49:45.950
<v Speaker 5>Court's going to get baked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's Kinda like way out.</v>

3686
02:49:46.220 --> 02:49:51.220
<v Speaker 5>Your House is 70 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It shouldn't just leave it in your </v>

3687
02:49:51.220 --> 02:49:51.220
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3688
02:49:51.540 --> 02:49:56.540
<v Speaker 5>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as long as it's going to maintain 70 </v>

<v Speaker 5>they're not doing anything about that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't abide by those rules.</v>

3725
02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:27.080
<v Speaker 5>I've had red wines that go with all </v>
<v Speaker 5>things in white wines ago and rosaries </v>

3726
02:51:27.080 --> 02:51:27.840
<v Speaker 5>that go with all things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll try all of them,</v>

02:51:34.590 --> 02:51:37.470
<v Speaker 5>I won't be afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I won't go with a set rule going in.</v>

3731
02:51:37.650 --> 02:51:39.890
<v Speaker 5>They used to be a hard fast rule,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3732
02:51:40.060 --> 02:51:41.730
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3733
02:51:42.120 --> 02:51:43.740
<v Speaker 5>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's more,</v>

3734
02:51:43.741 --> 02:51:48.741
<v Speaker 5>it's just more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just more of something to talk </v>

3735
02:51:48.741 --> 02:51:49.530
<v Speaker 5>about at the grocery store,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's like a fetish I'm having.</v>

3736
02:51:49.620 --> 02:51:51.300

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3738
02:51:54.870 --> 02:51:59.870
<v Speaker 5>Good parents here are these some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some restaurants have a pairing with </v>

3739
02:51:59.870 --> 02:52:03.090
<v Speaker 5>each selection and very rarely do you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a white wine with a bloody steak.</v>

3740
02:52:03.810 --> 02:52:04.950
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll do it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the earth where it goes off.</v>
