<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

10
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.020
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a friend of mine,</v>

12
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:20.724
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about creativity and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>source of creativity and how to </v>

13
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:24.264
<v Speaker 1>cultivate creativity and I stumbled </v>
<v Speaker 1>across something that you had on your </v>

14
00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:28.314
<v Speaker 1>website about creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about different methods or different </v>

15
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:36.741
<v Speaker 1>ways to try to inspire your creativity </v>
<v Speaker 1>or shock your system into creativity.</v>

16
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm always really impressed with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who take things that I've always like,</v>

17
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why or when my ideas come from.</v>

18
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.393
<v Speaker 1>And then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

19
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>check out this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually kind of broke this shit down</v>

20
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>and tried to figure out what was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>source of.</v>

21
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these ideas is aware where </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

22
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>these groovy moments of spontaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 1>just just like a blossoming of ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they come from.</v>

24
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.220
<v Speaker 1>My mechanistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to know how the shit works.</v>

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that by talking to you just in</v>

26
00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>the past 10 minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>like when I was talking about you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>cream in your coffee,</v>

30
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>like no drink should have one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scotch neat.</v>

31
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>

32
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got,</v>

33
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>you've got order or opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

34
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>But in your mind there it's very rigid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean it there liberating structures to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

36
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>I do everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do six things in my life I've ever.</v>

37
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.430
<v Speaker 1>If it doesn't fall into those </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories,</v>

38
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.063
<v Speaker 1>I mostly just at discovered years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the only stuff I've failed at was </v>

40
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>the stuff when I was too over extended </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was quitting,</v>

41
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I would give up half way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I could stick to it always led to</v>

42
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:54.150
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

43
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.691
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

44
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:56.680
<v Speaker 1>let's pare it down to essential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

45
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>and whenever life gets crazy for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first instinct is go small,</v>

46
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.073
<v Speaker 1>get small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the hardest things I think about </v>

47
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>being married and running an animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>sanctuary,</v>

48
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>my wife is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many dependents on me now.</v>

49
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 1>When stuff gets difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can no longer get small.</v>

50
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>You can't minimalize and get down to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>duffle bag.</v>

51
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Maxwell,</v>

52
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 1>he literally lives out of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a dry sack,</v>

53
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.023
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those dry socks that you could </v>

54
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>just throw in the river and that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a Duffel bag.</v>

55
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>That's his whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Lives Hotel to hotel travels all over</v>

56
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:25.824
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching people a strength and </v>

57
00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>conditioning routines and wellness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>

58
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.490
<v Speaker 1>That's all he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

59
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.330
<v Speaker 1>he has nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has no items.</v>

60
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>He has a like a ipad and he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

61
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.303
<v Speaker 1>When I was writing my first book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was right out of college before I </v>

62
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:41.670
<v Speaker 1>went to Grad school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

63
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>I lived in a place called anti matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the largest performance and video</v>

64
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:49.881
<v Speaker 1>gallery video galleries in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in San Francisco and huge space.</v>

65
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.680
<v Speaker 1>20 people living there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I lived above the tool room on a,</v>

66
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.383
<v Speaker 1>a plank of wood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the size of a Volkswagen microbus you </v>

67
00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.773
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crawled over my bed to get to my desk </v>

68
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.053
<v Speaker 1>and my clothes were on one side and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there were books on the other that was </v>

69
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was small and tiny and you know,</v>

70
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was a great,</v>

71
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to spend a couple of years there </v>

72
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:10.294
<v Speaker 1>and it where I started writing my first </v>
<v Speaker 1>novel and it was just wonderful owning </v>

73
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:13.144
<v Speaker 1>nothing and being that free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like one of those things </v>

74
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>where it sounds like a really good idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have to do it forever.</v>

75
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 1>this is how I'm going to live for </v>

<v Speaker 1>But if you said this is how I'm going to</v>

<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>

82
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always a good thing to do.</v>

83
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>When I was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

84
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

85
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.050
<v Speaker 1>now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

86
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't work.</v>

89
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>But like this idea that you have of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee black,</v>

90
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.630

<v Speaker 1>do you vacillate at all?</v>

91
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you vary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

92
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Every now and again I'm down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to go from starbucks or something.</v>

93
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually would like,</v>

94
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I have an urge to punch people and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordered that crap.</v>

95
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

96
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>I just cause it's Yummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delicious.</v>

97
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>I believe you do believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do know I'll be an asshole.</v>

98
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

99
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:04.894
<v Speaker 1>it just like I walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like he takes them 17 minutes to </v>

100
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 1>order their coffee and 20 minutes to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.113
<v Speaker 1>make their coffee and I'm sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just want like a small cup of </v>

102
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:13.084
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black place.</v>

103
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.983
<v Speaker 1>But let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're ordering coffee from </v>

104
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have shitty tasting coffee anyway.</v>

105
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Their coffee tastes terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

106
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 1>That if you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get burnt coffee for the</v>

107
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:22.084
<v Speaker 1>most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about starbucks is it's </v>

108
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>convenient and consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not good.</v>

109
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you measuring against?</v>

110
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Are you measuring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>install their other copy?</v>

111
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Are you talking about what was there </v>
<v Speaker 1>before starbucks?</v>

112
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.261
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

113
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you can get diner coffee,</v>

114
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>which is even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

115
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 1>One thing that starbucks does have is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that weird machine.</v>

116
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is a compressed clover clover?</v>

117
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a.</v>

118
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculously expensive machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it might cost 50 or $60,000.</v>

119
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:52.803
<v Speaker 1>It might be even more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And starbucks bought up the patent for </v>

120
00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>them and the guys who invented it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some series geniuses,</v>

121
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 1>dis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were coffee dorks and they said,</v>

122
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:01.774
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us find out what is the exact </v>

123
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:04.204
<v Speaker 1>correct temperature for each individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>being program a bruce cycle where you </v>

124
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 1>brew it for the exact correct time for </v>
<v Speaker 1>each individual being.</v>

125
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they got it down to a science,</v>

126
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.820
<v Speaker 1>so inside starbucks is almost the anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>starbucks,</v>

127
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:19.743
<v Speaker 1>so you have your regular starbucks drip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is almost always burnt to a crisp </v>

128
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:25.150
<v Speaker 1>and tastes bitter and then they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this machine.</v>

129
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.863
<v Speaker 1>It'll come on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This machine that clover and it's a </v>

130
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>digitally programmed a poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff in there,</v>

131
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.500
<v Speaker 1>you could only get it at starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the water comes out.</v>

132
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.930
<v Speaker 1>It's heated to the exact correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperature.</v>

133
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:38.764
<v Speaker 1>They stir it with a whisk and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>works on a vacuum and as it goes down </v>

134
00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:45.214
<v Speaker 1>and presses this thing it the grinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up to the top and you have like </v>

135
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.410
<v Speaker 1>this hockey puck of grinds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like it'll brew it for the exact,</v>

136
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one minute,</v>

137
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:59.881
<v Speaker 1>15 seconds that this program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopian coffee should be brewed for.</v>

138
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Or if you have some sort of Colombian or</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

139
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the coffee is,</v>

140
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it know like you're throwing in.</v>

141
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You program it like you,</v>

142
00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you whatever coffee it is,</v>

143
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:13.904
<v Speaker 1>whatever type of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a different individual settings </v>

144
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:16.634
<v Speaker 1>for that type of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then it brews it and then when the </v>

145
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 1>six seconds is up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it lifts up like this and that's the</v>

146
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:22.634
<v Speaker 1>grinds it or the grounds rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the coffee comes out and it is </v>

147
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:33.341
<v Speaker 1>really good and the coffee comes out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect coffee cup size and then the top</v>

148
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:35.600
<v Speaker 1>thing when it comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this.</v>

149
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>A hockey puck have used up coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>grounds.</v>

150
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.533
<v Speaker 2>Do we know why it's called the clover?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird name for a coffee </v>

151
00:06:42.091 --> 00:06:43.290
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is weird,</v>

152
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.183
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe someone just really likes clovers </v>

153
00:06:45.181 --> 00:06:47.220
<v Speaker 2>and they invented it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you use a little squeegee,</v>

154
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.810
<v Speaker 2>clean that sucker off and that's a wrap </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

155
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.190
<v Speaker 2>soon there'll be homeless guys cleaning </v>
<v Speaker 2>off the coffee for you.</v>

156
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.073
<v Speaker 2>Do you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a new market for the squeegee </v>

157
00:06:55.411 --> 00:06:56.244
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

158
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.660
<v Speaker 2>squeegee thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

159
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>La doesn't have the squeegee people.</v>

160
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.023
<v Speaker 2>Too many guns to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think after the dire wolf wolf </v>

161
00:07:06.181 --> 00:07:08.640
<v Speaker 2>incident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the first freeway killer,</v>

162
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.040
<v Speaker 2>I think people got dire wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they called them.</v>

163
00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:13.140
<v Speaker 2>There was a grateful dead song called </v>
<v Speaker 2>dire wolf,</v>

164
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.360
<v Speaker 2>but it was one of the early freeway </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooters.</v>

165
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.051
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out here.</v>

166
00:07:16.051 --> 00:07:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that sort of like in la,</v>

167
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 2>like we don't want anybody coming.</v>

168
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 2>There are cars because was there one </v>
<v Speaker 2>freeway shooter?</v>

169
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Was there more than one or more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>one?</v>

170
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.240
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

171
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it did a little story about him as a pro</v>

172
00:07:28.171 --> 00:07:30.540
<v Speaker 2>skier and he got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was driving through the Sierra Nevada</v>

173
00:07:30.541 --> 00:07:32.610
<v Speaker 2>mountains is 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 years ago.</v>

174
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.693
<v Speaker 2>And somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some snipers perched up on a bridge and </v>

175
00:07:35.071 --> 00:07:35.904
<v Speaker 2>put a bullet into his heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Craziest part is he pulled off the </v>

176
00:07:39.391 --> 00:07:40.224
<v Speaker 2>highway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>found a fire station and like walked in </v>

177
00:07:42.571 --> 00:07:45.000
<v Speaker 2>and like collapsed on a table and had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been shot in the heart.</v>

178
00:07:45.001 --> 00:07:47.280
<v Speaker 2>Just dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

179
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.250
<v Speaker 2>Did they catch the guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they ever caught him.</v>

180
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.860
<v Speaker 2>What a crazy impulse</v>

181
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.173
<v Speaker 1>to just decide you're going to make your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life more exciting in this moment by </v>

182
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.800
<v Speaker 1>taking another person's life.</v>

183
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange,</v>

184
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.120
<v Speaker 1>strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thing that happens every now and again.</v>

185
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a reoccurring phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super,</v>

186
00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:11.390
<v Speaker 1>super rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why the people with guns get so</v>

187
00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:14.420
<v Speaker 1>frustrated when someone does something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that because they say,</v>

188
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:15.254
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the access to guns is not what causes </v>

189
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:17.444
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone has to be sick in the head in </v>

190
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:19.424
<v Speaker 1>order to do this in the first place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have millions and millions and </v>

191
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.873
<v Speaker 1>millions of legal gun owners who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't even consider doing something </v>

192
00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:25.154
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every now and then someone gets on </v>

193
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:28.844
<v Speaker 1>top of a rock and puts those cross hairs</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a person just for whatever fucking </v>

194
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some strange chemical imbalance,</v>

195
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.243
<v Speaker 1>some strange combination of a fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood and very depressing life and </v>

196
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.010
<v Speaker 1>neurochemistries all out of whack.</v>

197
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:46.550
<v Speaker 2>You gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't.</v>

198
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.830
<v Speaker 2>It's five percent or 10 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>number.</v>

199
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:51.180
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember which one it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's psychotic.</v>

200
00:08:51.181 --> 00:08:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

201
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:52.723
<v Speaker 2>just happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you've got that portion of the </v>

202
00:08:55.111 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 2>population that you know</v>

203
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.963
<v Speaker 1>is crazy and doesn't feel empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you wonder if we should have guns </v>

204
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it definitely does,</v>

205
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:04.200
<v Speaker 1>but then it makes you wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

206
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:05.034
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to follow the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should have guns just for them </v>

207
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 1>fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair point.</v>

208
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.473
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like many things in life to </v>

209
00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:15.660
<v Speaker 1>really is no ultimate answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have so many variables going on there.</v>

210
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.950
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why black coffee's not always the</v>

211
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:20.784
<v Speaker 1>way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes throw a little cream in that </v>

212
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:23.040
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

213
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Just mix it up a little Stevia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

214
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:28.370
<v Speaker 1>it's got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

215
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.640
<v Speaker 1>A little like Ave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

216
00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 1>jack and coke occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

217
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I understand just every now and okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll go out later.</v>

218
00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:37.200
<v Speaker 1>We'll have pina coladas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be fine.</v>

219
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.940
<v Speaker 1>There'll be blended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be frothy.</v>

220
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:40.560
<v Speaker 1>You'll have an umbrella to become mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Umbrellas.</v>

221
00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

222
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm comfortable with my own masculinity.</v>

223
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.940
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will drink a cosmopolitan boat.</v>

224
00:09:44.941 --> 00:09:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who drinks here?</v>

225
00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 1>There's something about those that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>very unmanly.</v>

226
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:54.021
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to be enjoying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual taste of a sugary sweet things if</v>

227
00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:55.350
<v Speaker 1>you're a manly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

228
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:57.300
<v Speaker 1>absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially not if they have alcohol.</v>

229
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't kick ass and drink strawberry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Daiquiris.</v>

230
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:00.144
<v Speaker 1>It's a contradiction in term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you could do it if you </v>

231
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:03.750
<v Speaker 1>were like the rock though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

232
00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:04.584
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to have Mike Tyson once </v>

233
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.780
<v Speaker 1>daughter Strawberry Daiquiri on backing </v>
<v Speaker 1>him up.</v>

234
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:07.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If like you get to a certain level of </v>

235
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:10.074
<v Speaker 1>manliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just take it completely the </v>

236
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:12.090
<v Speaker 1>other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

237
00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Wearing clogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just go off,</v>

238
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.440
<v Speaker 1>wear a kilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gives a fuck.</v>

239
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.723
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

240
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.713
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this article that he wrote about </v>

241
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:21.510
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember which one was called?</v>

242
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Which one of you're looking at him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not know the.</v>

243
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:28.190
<v Speaker 1>You had a bunch of different things </v>
<v Speaker 1>listed as a various things that people,</v>

244
00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:29.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do northern.</v>

245
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.700
<v Speaker 1>It was long haul creativity and that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

246
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.563
<v Speaker 1>so I was looking at kind of a strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>topic because it turns out very few </v>

247
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:37.224
<v Speaker 1>people have looked at it and I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of work that's been </v>

248
00:10:39.121 --> 00:10:39.954
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about it.</v>

249
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I be more creative in the moment?</v>

250
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Right now I'm working on this project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

251
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.910
<v Speaker 1>but I started getting curious about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

252
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:48.744
<v Speaker 1>what does it take to be super creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the course of a career over 10 </v>

253
00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:52.230
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years,</v>

254
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.250
<v Speaker 1>30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years.</v>

255
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.383
<v Speaker 1>And I started to realize that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of kind of points in the life of a </v>

256
00:10:58.291 --> 00:10:59.124
<v Speaker 1>creative that nobody talks about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Places we get creative ended up getting </v>

257
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.930
<v Speaker 1>derailed roadblocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to start taking a look at that.</v>

258
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.580
<v Speaker 1>It may be my next book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not sure,</v>

259
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.270
<v Speaker 1>but something I've been poking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>

260
00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:12.104
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you follow Stephen King it all the </v>

261
00:11:13.441 --> 00:11:14.274
<v Speaker 1>writer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

262
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.293
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like his book on writing a book </v>

263
00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:18.541
<v Speaker 1>and reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

264
00:11:18.541 --> 00:11:20.700
<v Speaker 1>that's a really interesting one because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he kind of,</v>

265
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.713
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those people that are super </v>

266
00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:24.024
<v Speaker 1>successful and very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's probably one of the most </v>

267
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.220
<v Speaker 1>prolific writers ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have this sort of like just show up</v>

268
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.143
<v Speaker 1>mentality like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You people have all these ideas of what </v>

269
00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:36.000
<v Speaker 1>needs to be in place in order for them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be creative.</v>

270
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.930
<v Speaker 1>And Stephen King in a lot of ways is </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying just fucking do it.</v>

271
00:11:39.931 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Just sit down every day and do it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you do.</v>

272
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.650
<v Speaker 1>You are a writer and this is what you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you sit down,</v>

273
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.493
<v Speaker 1>you don't make excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he went over all the different </v>

274
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:53.330
<v Speaker 1>authors that had 19 kids and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put out 50 books and it's just got to do</v>

275
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

276
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.993
<v Speaker 2>And we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you read the war of Art Steve </v>

277
00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.223
<v Speaker 2>Pressfield's book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is amazing in that regard too </v>

278
00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:02.320
<v Speaker 2>because he kind of breaks down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very small book.</v>

279
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 2>It's an easy read for anybody who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in it,</v>

280
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.403
<v Speaker 2>but he breaks down all the different </v>
<v Speaker 2>variables that come into play where you </v>

281
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:10.114
<v Speaker 2>give yourself out and excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he calls it resistance and beating </v>

282
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:16.690
<v Speaker 2>that resistance and forcing yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 2>show up.</v>

283
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:21.691
<v Speaker 2>And then the rewards come for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's wake up at 3:34</v>

284
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.593
<v Speaker 2>AM and I like to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to be writing before my brain is </v>

285
00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:26.800
<v Speaker 2>even awake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be writing within four minutes</v>

286
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:29.600
<v Speaker 2>of getting out of bed because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

287
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you sleep,</v>

288
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:32.980
<v Speaker 2>your brainwaves dropped down kind of to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Alpha Theta,</v>

289
00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:36.070
<v Speaker 2>borderline alphas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative state.</v>

290
00:12:36.071 --> 00:12:36.904
<v Speaker 2>And if you wake all the way up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain waves are going to jump all </v>

291
00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:39.640
<v Speaker 2>the way back up to Beta.</v>

292
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.773
<v Speaker 2>So I don't want that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to keep my brainwaves in that </v>

293
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:44.710
<v Speaker 2>kind of create a face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't.</v>

294
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.040
<v Speaker 2>I never check email first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never do any of that stuff.</v>

295
00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:50.950
<v Speaker 2>I want to immediately get out of bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to my office,</v>

296
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:53.470
<v Speaker 2>have the coffee brewing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then be writing instantly.</v>

297
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.890
<v Speaker 2>That is a very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very interesting choice.</v>

298
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very smart.</v>

299
00:12:58.661 --> 00:12:59.650
<v Speaker 2>Trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But God damn dude,</v>

300
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 2>3:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>AM.</v>

301
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every writer,</v>

302
00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 2>every writer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say ever writer.</v>

303
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:09.220
<v Speaker 2>Most of the writers I know tend to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>time to write when nobody else is awake.</v>

304
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Either they do it late night or I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to do it early because I.</v>

305
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.193
<v Speaker 2>it's an old habit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was living in San Francisco and </v>

306
00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:18.160
<v Speaker 2>coming up and I was starting as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalist,</v>

307
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:21.250
<v Speaker 2>I was writing my books also Edward who </v>
<v Speaker 2>is young and hungry.</v>

308
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.220
<v Speaker 2>I had editors in New York would start </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

309
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were in their twenties to and they </v>

310
00:13:25.061 --> 00:13:25.721
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

311
00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:27.610
<v Speaker 2>they'd get in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd start calling me at 8:30</v>

312
00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:30.550
<v Speaker 2>in the morning their time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in California was 5:30</v>

313
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:32.380
<v Speaker 2>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The minute an editor called me and said,</v>

314
00:13:32.381 --> 00:13:33.520
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need you to do this.</v>

315
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:34.810
<v Speaker 2>I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was hungry.</v>

316
00:13:34.811 --> 00:13:35.644
<v Speaker 2>I was poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I one of the work with the answer was </v>

317
00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going.</v>

318
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted to be able to write my books</v>
<v Speaker 2>before that,</v>

319
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.590
<v Speaker 2>so I just started getting up earlier and</v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>

320
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.043
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably the best way to do it </v>

321
00:13:45.281 --> 00:13:47.890
<v Speaker 2>because I do the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do it when my kids are asleep,</v>

322
00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:49.630
<v Speaker 2>my wife's asleep when everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>asleep,</v>

323
00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 2>that's when I hit the bong and then go </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>

324
00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:57.901
<v Speaker 2>but oftentimes I'll be five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six hours in and then it'll be 5:00</v>

325
00:13:58.361 --> 00:13:59.194
<v Speaker 2>in the morning and then I stopped and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm freaked out and I just lay in </v>

326
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:05.200
<v Speaker 2>bed with my eyes open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going over all the different things that</v>

327
00:14:05.201 --> 00:14:06.034
<v Speaker 2>I just wrote.</v>

328
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the.</v>

329
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.790
<v Speaker 2>That's the other reason if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it.</v>

330
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:09.933
<v Speaker 2>The good news is my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of my writing has probably done at </v>

331
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:12.940
<v Speaker 2>least by noon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

332
00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I'll right from four to 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>AM.</v>

333
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Then I get some exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll come back,</v>

334
00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:18.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll do another session,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get some more exercise,</v>

335
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.910
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day I can shut it </v>
<v Speaker 2>down because I feel like,</v>

336
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:23.830
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought everything through.</v>

337
00:14:23.831 --> 00:14:24.664
<v Speaker 2>I've done everything I possibly can so I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can actually like get some sleep and </v>

338
00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:30.510
<v Speaker 2>started again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard a lot of people say that like</v>

339
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.160
<v Speaker 2>they'll take a break and then they'll go</v>
<v Speaker 2>for like a long hike,</v>

340
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.300
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they'll do some,</v>

341
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.420
<v Speaker 2>some something that's only mildly </v>
<v Speaker 2>exerting.</v>

342
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.640
<v Speaker 2>So there's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to creativity,</v>

343
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:40.474
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do some work on flow states being in </v>

344
00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:43.144
<v Speaker 2>the zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Optimals definitely want to talk to you </v>

345
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:48.841
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things we know is there's</v>

346
00:14:49.451 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 2>something called exercise induced </v>
<v Speaker 2>transient hypofrontality.</v>

347
00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:53.973
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the fancy term transient </v>

348
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:57.140
<v Speaker 3>hypofrontality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when we're in flow,</v>

349
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.873
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that causes it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is why your sense of self sort </v>

350
00:15:01.481 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 3>of disappears in flow and why time </v>
<v Speaker 3>passes strangely,</v>

351
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:04.754
<v Speaker 3>is your prefrontal Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the part of your brain that right back </v>

352
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:08.840
<v Speaker 3>here that governs most of your higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive functions,</v>

353
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:10.640
<v Speaker 3>executive functions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of morality since,</v>

354
00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:12.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will complex planning,</v>

355
00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 3>long term decision making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

356
00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:14.060
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

357
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.040
<v Speaker 3>Turns off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflow shuts down.</v>

358
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:20.330
<v Speaker 3>That portion of the brain shuts down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Transient meaning temporary hypo.</v>

359
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.730
<v Speaker 3>Hypo is the opposite of hyper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>H.</v>

360
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.880
<v Speaker 3>Ypo means to slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to shut down in front prefrontal Cortex,</v>

361
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:28.760
<v Speaker 3>a transient hypofrontality when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise,</v>

362
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:30.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've low grade physical exercise,</v>

363
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:32.030
<v Speaker 3>you're walking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going for a hike,</v>

364
00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.530
<v Speaker 3>25 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know this feeling,</v>

365
00:15:33.531 --> 00:15:35.030
<v Speaker 3>you're brain gets quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

366
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.223
<v Speaker 3>Everything starts to sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exercise induced transient </v>

367
00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:38.504
<v Speaker 3>hypofrontality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can sort of walk yourself into a </v>

368
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:43.360
<v Speaker 3>low grade flow state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really,</v>

369
00:15:43.361 --> 00:15:44.194
<v Speaker 3>it's a great reset if you've been doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something creative and you didn't get </v>

370
00:15:46.191 --> 00:15:47.024
<v Speaker 3>into flow and it was frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a way to sort of reset your </v>

371
00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:50.174
<v Speaker 3>brain and start over and if you did get </v>
<v Speaker 3>into flow and as a really vibrant </v>

372
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:55.154
<v Speaker 3>writing session,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's another way to chill it out and </v>

373
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.063
<v Speaker 3>start over.</v>

374
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:03.470
<v Speaker 4>Now this area of the brain that quiets </v>
<v Speaker 4>down because you're.</v>

375
00:16:03.931 --> 00:16:06.330
<v Speaker 4>You're no longer second guessing </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

376
00:16:06.331 --> 00:16:09.150
<v Speaker 4>You no longer thinking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

377
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.070
<v Speaker 4>whether this is the right thing to do or</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

378
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.920
<v Speaker 4>that does that have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does that have,</v>

379
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.700
<v Speaker 4>do you have to be doing something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've done many,</v>

380
00:16:17.701 --> 00:16:18.534
<v Speaker 4>many times?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've carved these sorts of paths of </v>

381
00:16:20.221 --> 00:16:21.054
<v Speaker 4>recognition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like say like if you were a guy who is </v>

382
00:16:23.491 --> 00:16:24.324
<v Speaker 4>really into running and you run all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and like this is like once you </v>

383
00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:29.310
<v Speaker 4>start running is your body's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

384
00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:31.680
<v Speaker 4>we run and this is what we did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We already know how to do this.</v>

385
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.040
<v Speaker 4>And so then you can get into that sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of strange flow state.</v>

386
00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.113
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>

387
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.430
<v Speaker 3>So there's a couple of different answers</v>
<v Speaker 3>to that and probably the truthful answer</v>

388
00:16:41.431 --> 00:16:44.560
<v Speaker 3>is we're not 100 percent certain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's what we know.</v>

389
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Usually flow is what happens when you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>let.</v>

390
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:50.640
<v Speaker 3>You've automatized a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>skills,</v>

391
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.533
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they come together for the first </v>

392
00:16:52.741 --> 00:16:54.860
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Automatize means you've just passed them</v>

393
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.490
<v Speaker 3>to your conscious mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your subconscious,</v>

394
00:16:56.491 --> 00:16:58.860
<v Speaker 3>so you now know how to do them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

395
00:16:58.861 --> 00:16:59.694
<v Speaker 3>You no longer learning the skills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually what happens with flow is when </v>

396
00:17:01.801 --> 00:17:05.280
<v Speaker 3>you take like three or four of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>automized skills and bring them together</v>

397
00:17:05.281 --> 00:17:07.800
<v Speaker 3>for the first time and everything sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of levels up.</v>

398
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:09.023
<v Speaker 3>So that's typically how it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you see things with like action </v>

399
00:17:11.851 --> 00:17:12.301
<v Speaker 3>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

400
00:17:12.301 --> 00:17:13.134
<v Speaker 3>People go snowboarding for the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and you know the first couple of </v>

401
00:17:15.811 --> 00:17:17.160
<v Speaker 3>hours where they don't know what they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

402
00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:18.960
<v Speaker 3>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're falling all over the place,</v>

403
00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.003
<v Speaker 3>but by the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because snowboarding's a fairly easy </v>

404
00:17:21.811 --> 00:17:22.644
<v Speaker 3>sport to get down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the first time you can actually </v>

405
00:17:24.601 --> 00:17:26.700
<v Speaker 3>start gliding down the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the end of the day,</v>

406
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.150
<v Speaker 3>you'll see people get into flow that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know and they'll have these really deep,</v>

407
00:17:30.151 --> 00:17:30.984
<v Speaker 3>powerful flow states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons is because risk is a </v>

408
00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:36.030
<v Speaker 3>flow trigger risk spikes dumpmen in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain which drives focus,</v>

409
00:17:36.031 --> 00:17:39.600
<v Speaker 3>which helps kick you into flow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that'll get you there.</v>

410
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.790
<v Speaker 3>And so that shows up with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>snowboarding with the action sports.</v>

411
00:17:42.791 --> 00:17:43.624
<v Speaker 3>So I think there are certain things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get into flow along the way </v>

412
00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 3>earlier on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as general rule,</v>

413
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.280
<v Speaker 4>it's skills that you've already </v>
<v Speaker 4>automatized and you're really,</v>

414
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 4>really good at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

415
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:56.310
<v Speaker 4>that's why I was asking because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

416
00:17:56.311 --> 00:17:59.040
<v Speaker 4>I've achieved those states,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

417
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 4>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like playing pool.</v>

418
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.650
<v Speaker 4>It's called being in stroke or being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dead stroke.</v>

419
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.890
<v Speaker 4>And when you get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you play pool,</v>

420
00:18:07.891 --> 00:18:10.050
<v Speaker 4>especially if you play for hours and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours at a time,</v>

421
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.840
<v Speaker 4>you get to this place and sometimes it </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't last.</v>

422
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:14.970
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it only lasts for a few games </v>
<v Speaker 4>at a time.</v>

423
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.133
<v Speaker 4>But you get to this place where you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>put that ball exactly where you wanted </v>

424
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.903
<v Speaker 4>to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know exactly where the ball's </v>

425
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.203
<v Speaker 4>going to reflect off that ball and </v>
<v Speaker 4>bounce to the next rail and being in a </v>

426
00:18:26.221 --> 00:18:29.010
<v Speaker 4>perfect position on the next ball and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get into this flow,</v>

427
00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:32.160
<v Speaker 4>this dead stroke stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when you're there,</v>

428
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:36.540
<v Speaker 4>you're almost like a partition or almost</v>
<v Speaker 4>like rather a passenger.</v>

429
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.270
<v Speaker 4>You're almost sitting back and watching </v>
<v Speaker 4>this play out.</v>

430
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:44.510
<v Speaker 4>And the key to maintaining that state is</v>
<v Speaker 4>to never recognize the state.</v>

431
00:18:44.701 --> 00:18:47.100
<v Speaker 4>Never acknowledged the state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never go,</v>

432
00:18:47.101 --> 00:18:49.050
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in dead punch right now.</v>

433
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.003
<v Speaker 4>Because if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you'll start thinking and then </v>

434
00:18:51.451 --> 00:18:53.550
<v Speaker 4>you'll start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll bring your prefrontal cortex back</v>

435
00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:56.070
<v Speaker 4>online and it'll kick you out of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>state.</v>

436
00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:57.360
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let me ask you a question.</v>

437
00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.253
<v Speaker 4>You were talking earlier and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about fighting and how </v>

438
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.760
<v Speaker 4>everything fits together in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you find more flow as a fighter,</v>

439
00:19:05.761 --> 00:19:07.980
<v Speaker 4>as a comic?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will the explain to people?</v>

440
00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:08.814
<v Speaker 4>What we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about is that I'm </v>

441
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.053
<v Speaker 4>preparing for an martial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arts in general can be very psychedelic </v>

442
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.823
<v Speaker 4>because there's such an intense </v>
<v Speaker 4>introspective aspect to training where </v>

443
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:21.534
<v Speaker 4>you have to examine your skills so </v>
<v Speaker 4>closely and you have to be so acutely </v>

444
00:19:24.781 --> 00:19:25.614
<v Speaker 4>aware of your strengths and weaknesses </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you cannot have any delusion about </v>

445
00:19:27.811 --> 00:19:28.644
<v Speaker 4>it because once the moment funnels down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this pressure builds to this one </v>

446
00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:34.650
<v Speaker 4>event where you have to actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>compete.</v>

447
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.040
<v Speaker 4>That event is if you do not have all </v>
<v Speaker 4>your ducks in a row,</v>

448
00:19:38.041 --> 00:19:38.874
<v Speaker 4>if you have not examined all aspects and</v>
<v Speaker 4>prepared for all aspects of this </v>

449
00:19:43.561 --> 00:19:45.840
<v Speaker 4>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like 100 percent honest,</v>

450
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.900
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna fuck up and you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be scared and you're going to be nervous</v>

451
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:51.420
<v Speaker 4>and you're going to be nervous anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're going to really be nervous if</v>

452
00:19:51.421 --> 00:19:53.940
<v Speaker 4>you haven't done your work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it'd be you.</v>

453
00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.740
<v Speaker 4>There's a selflessness that gets sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>exposed when you're doing that.</v>

454
00:19:58.741 --> 00:20:01.250
<v Speaker 4>Not Selflessness rather,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

455
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.173
<v Speaker 4>you step outside of yourself to examine </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself almost as if you're looking at </v>

456
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.570
<v Speaker 4>yourself as a mathematical program </v>
<v Speaker 4>rather than as a person.</v>

457
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.840
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then when you're,</v>

458
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.840
<v Speaker 4>when you're fighting and all and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's going well,</v>

459
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:16.950
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

460
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.650
<v Speaker 4>not always happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if it is going well,</v>

461
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.620
<v Speaker 4>sometimes things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like sometimes you'll hit people and you</v>

462
00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 4>had no idea how you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you,</v>

463
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:30.110
<v Speaker 4>like you're so it's so programmed in you</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you have to figure out how to quiet</v>

464
00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:33.060
<v Speaker 4>everything down and just react.</v>

465
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.740
<v Speaker 4>But that only happens through intense </v>
<v Speaker 4>training for so long that you have these</v>

466
00:20:37.741 --> 00:20:41.880
<v Speaker 4>pathways carved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you'll see it in a fight with floyd</v>

467
00:20:41.881 --> 00:20:42.714
<v Speaker 4>mayweather is a great example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone will throw a punch at him and </v>

468
00:20:44.461 --> 00:20:48.640
<v Speaker 4>you will literally see his eyes open as </v>
<v Speaker 4>the glove comes to his face.</v>

469
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.380
<v Speaker 4>He moves just out of the way and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>counters any counter so quickly.</v>

470
00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:55.990
<v Speaker 4>There's no way he could have thought of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not even thinking.</v>

471
00:20:55.991 --> 00:20:59.500
<v Speaker 4>It's just he's his patterns recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

472
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:00.334
<v Speaker 4>there's this and then that comes after </v>
<v Speaker 4>this and there's not even a thought </v>

473
00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:04.870
<v Speaker 4>process behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just does.</v>

474
00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.950
<v Speaker 4>He just flows with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's when you can be,</v>

475
00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:13.150
<v Speaker 4>when you have actual space to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>creative inside that are right,</v>

476
00:21:13.151 --> 00:21:16.090
<v Speaker 4>when it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're just not reacting in a fight</v>

477
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:17.290
<v Speaker 4>and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you actually,</v>

478
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:19.770
<v Speaker 4>you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the flow is peaking,</v>

479
00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:20.623
<v Speaker 4>you really can make any decision you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to and it doesn't actually feel </v>

480
00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:23.540
<v Speaker 4>like you're.</v>

481
00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.490
<v Speaker 4>You're making this decision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>feels like you're,</v>

482
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.490
<v Speaker 4>you're watching somebody else make that </v>
<v Speaker 4>decision.</v>

483
00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:30.340
<v Speaker 4>You're a passenger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the way I described finding,</v>

484
00:21:30.341 --> 00:21:35.341
<v Speaker 4>I say fighting is extreme problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>solving with dire physical consequences.</v>

485
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:37.830
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

486
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why I like action sports as well.</v>

487
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.620
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

488
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.640
<v Speaker 4>When you see someone doing like 15 flips</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a bmx bike,</v>

489
00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.770
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't land on your tires,</v>

490
00:21:47.771 --> 00:21:49.090
<v Speaker 4>you got a real problem there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fella.</v>

491
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:50.303
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something superintendent to it </v>

492
00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.080
<v Speaker 4>now in fighting add on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just the air and the ground,</v>

493
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.153
<v Speaker 4>but another person who's just like you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just as trained as you and is trying to </v>

494
00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:03.340
<v Speaker 4>do to you what you're trying to do to </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

495
00:22:03.341 --> 00:22:06.340
<v Speaker 4>So you're solving this puzzle that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>alive,</v>

496
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.060
<v Speaker 4>human being with all these preprogrammed</v>
<v Speaker 4>variables that they have.</v>

497
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:11.883
<v Speaker 4>So your question was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where do you experience the flow state </v>

498
00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:14.920
<v Speaker 4>more fighting or comedy?</v>

499
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.753
<v Speaker 4>I think probably comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's easier because there's not as many </v>

500
00:22:18.161 --> 00:22:22.750
<v Speaker 4>consequences and you also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you develop a routine or like you'll um,</v>

501
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.840
<v Speaker 4>the way I do it and a lot of guys do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same way.</v>

502
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.003
<v Speaker 4>You put together a special and then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>film it and then you abandoned it and </v>

503
00:22:30.491 --> 00:22:35.410
<v Speaker 4>then you start from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that I just did one and it just aired</v>

504
00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.053
<v Speaker 4>October 21st.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I'm in this like new material </v>

505
00:22:39.701 --> 00:22:42.170
<v Speaker 4>acquisition mode which takes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

506
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.083
<v Speaker 4>takes a while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's very little flow going on </v>

507
00:22:45.191 --> 00:22:46.024
<v Speaker 4>while I'm on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of its calculation and </v>

508
00:22:47.531 --> 00:22:49.600
<v Speaker 4>thinking and remembering all the new </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

509
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.830
<v Speaker 4>But then after a few months of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you get to this point where,</v>

510
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:54.683
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that bit and then there's this </v>

511
00:22:55.751 --> 00:22:56.584
<v Speaker 4>bit and this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you get into this comfortable </v>

512
00:22:57.581 --> 00:22:59.770
<v Speaker 4>zone and then it starts to flow again.</v>

513
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.840
<v Speaker 4>And then you just got to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

514
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.033
<v Speaker 4>this is what we got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like an hour and 20 minutes of this </v>

515
00:23:04.391 --> 00:23:05.224
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let this simmer this down to 60 bad ass </v>

516
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:09.700
<v Speaker 4>minutes and wrap it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I start all over again.</v>

517
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.670
<v Speaker 4>It's usually like a two year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two year presses.</v>

518
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:12.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two year cycle.</v>

519
00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.240
<v Speaker 4>Do you know when you're developing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good bit?</v>

520
00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:17.883
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you think it's good and it </v>

521
00:23:19.061 --> 00:23:19.894
<v Speaker 4>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you think it sucks and it </v>

522
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:23.200
<v Speaker 4>turns out to be your best one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

523
00:23:23.201 --> 00:23:24.034
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes you're onstage and then in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the moment a new idea pops in your head </v>

524
00:23:28.331 --> 00:23:29.830
<v Speaker 4>that makes it way better than it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

525
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:30.783
<v Speaker 4>And it's one of the only art forms I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think we have to do it in front of a </v>

526
00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:35.860
<v Speaker 4>crowd to develop it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He like,</v>

527
00:23:35.861 --> 00:23:38.800
<v Speaker 4>you could write the dopest song ever by </v>
<v Speaker 4>herself.</v>

528
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.903
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that have wrote </v>

529
00:23:40.661 --> 00:23:41.494
<v Speaker 4>some written,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some amazing songs and there was no one </v>

530
00:23:43.151 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 4>in the room and they wrote it and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>programmed the music and</v>

531
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.431
<v Speaker 1>then go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

532
00:23:46.431 --> 00:23:47.870
<v Speaker 1>check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a song I wrote and you're like,</v>

533
00:23:47.871 --> 00:23:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is incredible.</v>

534
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:53.450
<v Speaker 1>They didn't need anybody for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came up with it in,</v>

535
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:58.000
<v Speaker 1>in like in their own personal head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sat down with comedy.</v>

536
00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:00.560
<v Speaker 1>You kind kinda have to have an audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the idea,</v>

537
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.753
<v Speaker 1>you write things out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really come fully </v>

538
00:24:03.591 --> 00:24:04.360
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

539
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.193
<v Speaker 1>It?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't cure unless the audience is </v>

540
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:09.560
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that makes sense.</v>

541
00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.413
<v Speaker 1>That totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different kinds of jokes for different </v>

542
00:24:12.261 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 1>audiences as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

543
00:24:13.371 --> 00:24:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

544
00:24:14.691 --> 00:24:17.990
<v Speaker 1>but you can't see those people change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't worry about them.</v>

545
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:19.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

546
00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:19.853
<v Speaker 1>you're got to do things that you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>are funny because the problem with </v>

547
00:24:22.311 --> 00:24:24.410
<v Speaker 1>comedy also is that there's only one </v>
<v Speaker 1>genre,</v>

548
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.580
<v Speaker 1>but there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's many,</v>

549
00:24:25.581 --> 00:24:27.330
<v Speaker 1>many genres of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

550
00:24:27.331 --> 00:24:28.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy is comedy,</v>

551
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.990
<v Speaker 1>but who the fuck goes to see live music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

552
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.943
<v Speaker 1>and you go to see live music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Johnny Cash fall by the Wu Tang </v>

553
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:36.710
<v Speaker 1>clan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

554
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would go see rap,</v>

555
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.820
<v Speaker 1>you'd go to see country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go see rock.</v>

556
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.390
<v Speaker 1>You would likely go to see the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>music that you're really into,</v>

557
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:45.703
<v Speaker 1>whereas comedies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just one universal generic term for a </v>

558
00:24:49.191 --> 00:24:49.940
<v Speaker 1>bunch of</v>

559
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.020
<v Speaker 3>go see Steven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

560
00:24:51.021 --> 00:24:53.290
<v Speaker 3>Followed by Dave Chappelle or radically</v>

561
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:54.261
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

562
00:24:54.261 --> 00:24:55.094
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

563
00:24:55.370 --> 00:25:00.370
<v Speaker 1>But some people like only squeaky clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Brian Regan type comedy and if they</v>

564
00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:04.430
<v Speaker 1>went to see doug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stan hope they would leave and disgust,</v>

565
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:05.923
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

566
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.190
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

567
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.170
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

568
00:25:09.171 --> 00:25:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Well it's weird because there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a bunch of different ways</v>

569
00:25:12.321 --> 00:25:13.940
<v Speaker 1>to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it only has one name,</v>

570
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:15.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's like,</v>

571
00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:16.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

572
00:25:16.491 --> 00:25:17.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what kind of music do you do?</v>

573
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:19.123
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

574
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:20.510
<v Speaker 1>so we need new names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

575
00:25:20.511 --> 00:25:22.600
<v Speaker 1>it's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

576
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

577
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.440
<v Speaker 1>You're the one who started it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

578
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.200
<v Speaker 1>tried to back you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just thinking about it too much.</v>

579
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Overthinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overthinking a I think is a,</v>

580
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.670
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've talked about that many times with</v>

581
00:25:37.671 --> 00:25:38.504
<v Speaker 1>flow state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the second guessing and that part </v>

582
00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:42.104
<v Speaker 1>of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doubts is really the enemy of that </v>

583
00:25:44.121 --> 00:25:44.890
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

584
00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:45.910
<v Speaker 3>It's twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

585
00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.590
<v Speaker 3>you're activating your prefrontal </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cortex,</v>

586
00:25:47.591 --> 00:25:48.424
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The party of brand that's doing that </v>

587
00:25:48.971 --> 00:25:51.880
<v Speaker 3>overthinking and whenever you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>stressed,</v>

588
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:53.980
<v Speaker 3>obviously the brand starts releasing </v>
<v Speaker 3>cortisol.</v>

589
00:25:53.981 --> 00:25:55.590
<v Speaker 3>Norepinephrine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your stress hormones,</v>

590
00:25:55.591 --> 00:25:58.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so flow exists.</v>

591
00:25:58.241 --> 00:26:00.730
<v Speaker 3>One flow exists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call it the flow channel,</v>

592
00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:01.743
<v Speaker 3>and the idea basically is that one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the easiest ways to trigger flow is to </v>

593
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.390
<v Speaker 3>is what's called the challenge skills </v>
<v Speaker 3>balance,</v>

594
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:08.523
<v Speaker 3>so flow shows up best when the challenge</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the task at hand slightly exceeds </v>

595
00:26:13.421 --> 00:26:14.254
<v Speaker 3>your skillset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you want to stretch but not snap and </v>

596
00:26:16.871 --> 00:26:19.030
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing fancy or flow follows </v>
<v Speaker 3>focus,</v>

597
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.660
<v Speaker 3>so everything that triggers flow is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way of driving intention.</v>

598
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:23.523
<v Speaker 3>The present moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I was to what this emotionally I </v>

599
00:26:26.441 --> 00:26:31.180
<v Speaker 3>would say flow exists sort of not on but</v>
<v Speaker 3>near the midpoint between boredom.</v>

600
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.500
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough stimulation here.</v>

601
00:26:32.501 --> 00:26:34.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm not paying any attention and </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety.</v>

602
00:26:34.361 --> 00:26:36.040
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way too much stimulation.</v>

603
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm overburdened that anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>norepinephrine and cortisol.</v>

604
00:26:39.701 --> 00:26:40.534
<v Speaker 3>You get up in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're producing norepinephrine and </v>

605
00:26:42.701 --> 00:26:44.280
<v Speaker 3>cortisol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're knocking yourself</v>

606
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:49.310
<v Speaker 2>out of that sweet spot and why does </v>
<v Speaker 2>norepinephrine knock you out of it?</v>

607
00:26:49.981 --> 00:26:54.030
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that like a like one of those feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>good hormones?</v>

608
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.650
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be as well.</v>

609
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.200
<v Speaker 2>It can be a feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's essentially right.</v>

610
00:26:58.201 --> 00:27:03.201
<v Speaker 2>It's the internal indogenous version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>speed with the external substances.</v>

611
00:27:03.271 --> 00:27:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Same chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically a little bit.</v>

612
00:27:06.601 --> 00:27:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Wakes you up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drives focus too much.</v>

613
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.820
<v Speaker 2>You're jittery and freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

614
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.170
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's got to be a spectrum as well</v>

615
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:17.370
<v Speaker 2>to the toes date,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

616
00:27:17.371 --> 00:27:20.480
<v Speaker 2>So a bunch of different ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a check sent me jaime high chicks at</v>

617
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:20.851
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

618
00:27:20.851 --> 00:27:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Who's sort of the godfather of flow </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology was that he says his name.</v>

619
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Mihai chick sent me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

620

<v Speaker 2>Hi Me hot chicks sent me high and by the</v>

624
00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:34.650
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny story about how I.</v>

625
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.513
<v Speaker 2>So I was on NPR after my second book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the first time I wrote about </v>

626
00:27:38.131 --> 00:27:42.210
<v Speaker 2>him and I slaughtered his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just slaughtered,</v>

627
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.280
<v Speaker 2>destroyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the phone rings.</v>

628
00:27:44.281 --> 00:27:45.750
<v Speaker 2>It was live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in Cleveland.</v>

629
00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:48.050
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the color comes,</v>

630
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.610
<v Speaker 2>gets on like how can we help you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can you do?</v>

631
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.250
<v Speaker 2>Tell them moron sitting next to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's me.</v>

632
00:27:53.251 --> 00:27:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chick sent me hi.</v>

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Chick sent me high and he did like four </v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

634
00:27:58.321 --> 00:27:59.010
<v Speaker 2>We're out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

635
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:00.210
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been schooled.</v>

636
00:28:00.211 --> 00:28:01.044
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

637
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.710
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>

639
00:28:07.591 --> 00:28:09.600
<v Speaker 2>fucking Brownie points because he knew </v>
<v Speaker 2>the name.</v>

640
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that too.</v>

641
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that guy's an asshole.</v>

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.020
<v Speaker 2>Don't moron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moron.</v>

643
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:18.023
<v Speaker 2>Because you don't know the craziest </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking name than anybody's ever put on </v>

644
00:28:20.641 --> 00:28:21.630
<v Speaker 2>a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

645
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:23.850
<v Speaker 2>That isn't a poor kid in school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

646
00:28:23.851 --> 00:28:25.140
<v Speaker 2>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chuck sent me hide.</v>

647
00:28:25.141 --> 00:28:26.490
<v Speaker 2>The whole class was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

648
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.130
<v Speaker 2>Where did we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did we even get to him?</v>

649
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.233
<v Speaker 2>A flow state spectrum spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a check sent me high up in the </v>

650
00:28:35.491 --> 00:28:36.241
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties,</v>

651
00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:38.730
<v Speaker 2>seventies and eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Discovered a bunch of things about flow.</v>

652
00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:39.564
<v Speaker 2>That kind of fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First thing he discovered is that </v>

653
00:28:41.791 --> 00:28:42.624
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came up with 10 characteristics that </v>

654
00:28:44.701 --> 00:28:45.534
<v Speaker 2>define the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he actually sort of mashed up </v>

655
00:28:47.731 --> 00:28:49.590
<v Speaker 2>three triggers with seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics,</v>

656
00:28:49.591 --> 00:28:53.190
<v Speaker 2>but these are things like uninterrupted </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration,</v>

657
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:56.820
<v Speaker 2>your sense of self vanishing time </v>
<v Speaker 2>passing strangely.</v>

658
00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason,</v>

659
00:28:58.351 --> 00:29:00.240
<v Speaker 2>by the way this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does self vanished?</v>

660
00:29:00.241 --> 00:29:01.590
<v Speaker 2>But as time pass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so strangely,</v>

661
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:05.820
<v Speaker 2>inflow self and time are both </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculations performed in the prefrontal</v>

662
00:29:05.821 --> 00:29:07.470
<v Speaker 2>cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

663
00:29:07.471 --> 00:29:09.780
<v Speaker 2>time is calculated all over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>prefrontal cortex.</v>

664
00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:11.580
<v Speaker 2>This is David Eagleman is work from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Stanford,</v>

665
00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.653
<v Speaker 2>used to be at Baylor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when parts of the brain start to </v>

666
00:29:15.031 --> 00:29:17.040
<v Speaker 2>wink out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when part of the prefrontal cortex start</v>

667
00:29:17.041 --> 00:29:19.710
<v Speaker 2>to shut down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you move into flow,</v>

668
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.753
<v Speaker 2>your brain can no longer perform the </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculation so you can no longer </v>

669
00:29:22.801 --> 00:29:23.634
<v Speaker 2>separate past from present future and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're plunged into a deep now are </v>

670
00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:27.753
<v Speaker 2>internal present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's some of where that comes from </v>

671
00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:31.920
<v Speaker 2>is the deactivation of the prefrontal </v>
<v Speaker 2>cortex.</v>

672
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.173
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he figured out there were these seven </v>

673
00:29:34.471 --> 00:29:35.304
<v Speaker 2>characteristics of flow and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>micro flow states when a couple of them </v>

674
00:29:38.281 --> 00:29:39.114
<v Speaker 2>show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like you're at work and you're </v>

675
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:41.990
<v Speaker 2>talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you</v>

676
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:43.690
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you bump into a colleague in the hallway</v>

677
00:29:43.691 --> 00:29:46.450
<v Speaker 3>and you fall into a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets sucks.</v>

678
00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:48.490
<v Speaker 3>You in an hour goes by and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>notice.</v>

679
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.960
<v Speaker 3>That's microflow macro flow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When all the conditions show up at once.</v>

680
00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.990
<v Speaker 3>For the first 70 years we were looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the experience people thought we were</v>

681
00:29:55.991 --> 00:29:58.150
<v Speaker 3>looking at a full blown mystical </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

682
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.460
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know what it was because </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything can happen.</v>

683
00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:03.490
<v Speaker 3>You can have out of body experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have really strange,</v>

684
00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:06.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomena as a consciousness show up.</v>

685
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:07.443
<v Speaker 3>So macro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>micro flow to macro flow and it's a </v>

686
00:30:09.161 --> 00:30:12.490
<v Speaker 3>spectrum experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those words are one of those</v>

687
00:30:12.491 --> 00:30:13.660
<v Speaker 3>terms rather flow</v>

688
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:17.050
<v Speaker 4>state where there's a lot of woo </v>
<v Speaker 4>attached to that sort of state.</v>

689
00:30:17.051 --> 00:30:19.840
<v Speaker 4>Like a lot of people almost want to call</v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit automatically.</v>

690
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:20.770
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

691
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.210
<v Speaker 4>you're in a flow state.</v>

692
00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.281
<v Speaker 3>They stayed there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

693
00:30:23.281 --> 00:30:24.530
<v Speaker 3>there's reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

694
00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.820
<v Speaker 3>so the flow genome project,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is my organization,</v>

695
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.760
<v Speaker 3>our whole goal when I started with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>partner,</v>

696
00:30:29.761 --> 00:30:30.594
<v Speaker 3>Jamie wheal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was to grab flow back from the new age </v>

697
00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:36.090
<v Speaker 3>and put it on a hard science footing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of what happened.</v>

698
00:30:36.091 --> 00:30:37.410
<v Speaker 3>There were a number of things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>

699
00:30:37.411 --> 00:30:38.244
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

700
00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.830
<v Speaker 3>who do I kill?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is actually a woman's name,</v>

701
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:43.500
<v Speaker 3>another person with a crazy name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>H U,</v>

702
00:30:43.501 --> 00:30:46.950
<v Speaker 3>D A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a k I l she was the world's</v>

703
00:30:46.951 --> 00:30:47.784
<v Speaker 3>leading endorphin expert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's with the University of Michigan </v>

704
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:50.843
<v Speaker 3>and she was president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the American Society for neuroscience </v>

705
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.530
<v Speaker 3>and back in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say 99 or 2000.</v>

706
00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:57.960
<v Speaker 3>Gina Kolata was a science writer for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York Times,</v>

707
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:59.350
<v Speaker 3>asked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

708
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.233
<v Speaker 3>who do I kill about endorphins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which everybody had thought were one of </v>

709
00:31:02.491 --> 00:31:03.324
<v Speaker 3>the reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that causes flow and </v>

710
00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.070
<v Speaker 3>they were having a really hard time </v>
<v Speaker 3>measuring endorphins in the brain.</v>

711
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:09.900
<v Speaker 3>So there's that kill said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>told the New York Times,</v>

712
00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:11.880
<v Speaker 3>this is a total fantasy of the pop </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

713
00:31:11.881 --> 00:31:15.060
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was totally wrong,</v>

714
00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:19.110
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't until 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2008 that are technology got good enough</v>

715
00:31:19.111 --> 00:31:21.300
<v Speaker 3>to actually visualize the endorphins in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain.</v>

716
00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:22.373
<v Speaker 3>But at that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flow research in America kept going in </v>

717
00:31:24.871 --> 00:31:27.750
<v Speaker 3>Europe and other places in America </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically it went to a dead stop.</v>

718
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:31.470
<v Speaker 3>Nobody else was gonna fund it and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think the new age came in and went,</v>

719
00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:32.820
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flow.</v>

720
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:36.120
<v Speaker 3>It's such a great term working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what happened.</v>

721
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.313
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of what I tried to do at the flow </v>

722
00:31:39.421 --> 00:31:43.920
<v Speaker 3>genome project and what we've tried to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do is just put it back on a hard science</v>

723
00:31:43.921 --> 00:31:44.754
<v Speaker 3>footing because there's 150 years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>science behind flow flow science dates </v>

724
00:31:47.731 --> 00:31:48.564
<v Speaker 3>back almost to the 18 seventies to </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost the beginning of cognitive </v>

725
00:31:51.391 --> 00:31:54.930
<v Speaker 3>neuroscience and cognitive psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The research goes all the way back.</v>

726
00:31:54.931 --> 00:31:58.200
<v Speaker 3>William James was looking at this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>at Harvard and the turn of the century.</v>

727
00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.070
<v Speaker 3>There's a 100 years of research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean ultimate human performance,</v>

728
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.110
<v Speaker 3>optimal performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course we want to study it.</v>

729
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.630
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's funny because skeptical people will</v>

730
00:32:06.631 --> 00:32:07.464
<v Speaker 4>rally against it in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I had a conversation with Sam </v>

731
00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:10.853
<v Speaker 4>Harris about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were saying that when you look at it </v>

732
00:32:12.301 --> 00:32:14.550
<v Speaker 4>statistically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people are in the zone,</v>

733
00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:18.570
<v Speaker 4>they are not more accurate in basketball</v>
<v Speaker 4>than they are outside of it.</v>

734
00:32:18.571 --> 00:32:21.540
<v Speaker 4>That it's an anomaly and then it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an illusion.</v>

735
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.690
<v Speaker 4>It's an illusion of the state of mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you're achieving this.</v>

736
00:32:24.691 --> 00:32:26.460
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what you're talking about,</v>

737
00:32:26.461 --> 00:32:28.140
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't know how.</v>

738
00:32:28.141 --> 00:32:30.480
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how often that's been measured where you</v>

739
00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:32.990
<v Speaker 4>can say this because he was really </v>
<v Speaker 4>adamant about it.</v>

740
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.133
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like a super hyper skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam's talking specifically about streak </v>

741
00:32:38.431 --> 00:32:39.020
<v Speaker 4>shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

742
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:39.970
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're looking at.</v>

743
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And which is a funny and he's right.</v>

744
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:44.510
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his dad is absolutely correct.</v>

745
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:46.460
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just give you a counterpoint from my own</v>

746
00:32:46.461 --> 00:32:47.690
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have a book,</v>

747
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.150
<v Speaker 2>my third book called a small furry </v>
<v Speaker 2>prayer,</v>

748
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:51.223
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about the relationship between </v>

749
00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:52.874
<v Speaker 2>humans and animals and sort of on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>work that I do with dogs and my wife </v>

750
00:32:54.831 --> 00:32:58.560
<v Speaker 2>does with dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote the first half of them.</v>

751
00:32:58.561 --> 00:33:01.450
<v Speaker 2>It's been a 300 page book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote the first half of the fourth.</v>

752
00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:05.660
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing turned it in and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>agent called me up and she said,</v>

753
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.400
<v Speaker 2>or my editor called me up and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

754
00:33:07.401 --> 00:33:09.170
<v Speaker 2>the first hundred and 10 pages are </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty good.</v>

755
00:33:09.171 --> 00:33:10.004
<v Speaker 2>You got to Redo it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like everything from that point on </v>

756
00:33:11.631 --> 00:33:13.130
<v Speaker 2>sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need you to rewrite it.</v>

757
00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:14.503
<v Speaker 2>And she was totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I sat down to rewrite it and I sort </v>

758
00:33:17.331 --> 00:33:21.830
<v Speaker 2>of polished the first hundred and 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pages and couldn't,</v>

759
00:33:21.831 --> 00:33:23.060
<v Speaker 2>got stuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't write,</v>

760
00:33:23.061 --> 00:33:25.400
<v Speaker 2>couldn't write months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go by closing,</v>

761
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:27.350
<v Speaker 2>and my deadline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go downhill,</v>

762
00:33:27.351 --> 00:33:28.184
<v Speaker 2>mountain biking the very first time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my life and it just kicks me into this </v>

763
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.270
<v Speaker 2>down if you know how to ride a bike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get downhill,</v>

764
00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.790
<v Speaker 2>might have found biking pretty quickly.</v>

765
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.033
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just kicked me into an amazingly </v>

766
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:37.874
<v Speaker 2>deep flow state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went home and I started writing and I </v>

767
00:33:40.431 --> 00:33:42.050
<v Speaker 2>didn't stop for about two weeks </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight.</v>

768
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:45.050
<v Speaker 2>I went to sleep and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a nonstop flow state.</v>

769
00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Finished the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote 160 pages in like two weeks,</v>

770
00:33:48.981 --> 00:33:49.814
<v Speaker 2>which is incredible and bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And talk about feeling like a passenger </v>

771
00:33:52.401 --> 00:33:55.520
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea who wrote the second half</v>

772
00:33:55.521 --> 00:33:56.650
<v Speaker 2>of that book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No idea,</v>

773
00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:58.430
<v Speaker 2>just flowed out of me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pardon the Pun.</v>

774
00:33:58.820 --> 00:33:59.653
<v Speaker 2>But when I turned it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my editor came back to me and they had </v>

775
00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:05.270
<v Speaker 2>the first hundred and 10 pages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The part I had written outside of flow,</v>

776
00:34:05.271 --> 00:34:06.104
<v Speaker 2>there were still lots of errors and can </v>
<v Speaker 2>change this and fix this and this from </v>

777
00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:10.400
<v Speaker 2>page one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 to the end of the book,</v>

778
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:11.623
<v Speaker 2>not one change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was happy with everything I'd </v>

779
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:14.600
<v Speaker 2>written.</v>

780
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.790
<v Speaker 2>Book was a bestseller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is nominated for a Pulitzer prize.</v>

781
00:34:16.791 --> 00:34:18.920
<v Speaker 2>So obviously I did something right along</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way.</v>

782
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Second half happened totally in flow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

783
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.700
<v Speaker 2>that's the counter to Samsung argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the subject of this like?</v>

784
00:34:25.701 --> 00:34:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Well that's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what was the subject to the,</v>

785
00:34:28.131 --> 00:34:28.964
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the second half of the whole book is </v>

786
00:34:30.651 --> 00:34:34.790
<v Speaker 2>about the relationship between humans </v>
<v Speaker 2>and animals and about animal welfare and</v>

787
00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:39.820
<v Speaker 2>running a dog sanctuary and in where </v>
<v Speaker 2>empathy and altruism comes from and what</v>

788
00:34:39.891 --> 00:34:41.870
<v Speaker 2>it has to do with evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things along those lines.</v>

789
00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:43.203
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second half had a lot to do with </v>

790
00:34:44.571 --> 00:34:48.350
<v Speaker 2>sort of a little bit to do with animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>and spirituality and why we have this.</v>

791
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.710
<v Speaker 2>What is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

792
00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.713
<v Speaker 2>non we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we mean by like the spiritual </v>

793
00:34:52.701 --> 00:34:53.534
<v Speaker 2>relationship to nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you strip out the woo what's </v>

794
00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:58.700
<v Speaker 2>underneath that now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you were on the bike,</v>

795
00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.340
<v Speaker 2>do you remember the thought?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember what it was?</v>

796
00:35:01.341 --> 00:35:02.420
<v Speaker 2>What the catalyst was?</v>

797
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:05.323
<v Speaker 2>The catalyst was Bob Dylan's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>occupy local this song and it wasn't </v>

798
00:35:11.061 --> 00:35:12.080
<v Speaker 2>even his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

799
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.333
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the movie that where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they did all the Bob Dylan songs over </v>

800
00:35:16.131 --> 00:35:20.240
<v Speaker 2>again a couple years ago and was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody's version of that and something</v>

801
00:35:20.241 --> 00:35:22.430
<v Speaker 2>about the first couple lines to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>song.</v>

802
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.670
<v Speaker 2>It got the tone right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like the.</v>

803
00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.673
<v Speaker 2>There was something really kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bittersweet and raw in that song that I </v>

804
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:31.430
<v Speaker 2>needed in my book and that's what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

805
00:35:31.431 --> 00:35:32.264
<v Speaker 2>Somehow I came home with the salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that lyric in my head and I just </v>

806
00:35:35.451 --> 00:35:38.350
<v Speaker 2>started writing and that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

807
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.420
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably the.</v>

808
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.780
<v Speaker 2>You happen to pick the one thing where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have given you the cause.</v>

809
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:43.614
<v Speaker 2>Any other book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably going to whiff on that </v>

810
00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:46.800
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the one I remember.</v>

811
00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:48.163
<v Speaker 2>Is there</v>

812
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:49.143
<v Speaker 4>weird how certain songs will trigger </v>
<v Speaker 4>like some sort of inspirational </v>

813
00:35:52.901 --> 00:35:56.410
<v Speaker 4>creativity inside of you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've always wondered what that is.</v>

814
00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:57.373
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I learned this from Hunter Thompson and </v>

815
00:35:59.531 --> 00:36:00.364
<v Speaker 4>I've done it many times myself where </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll take a song and I'll put it on </v>

816
00:36:02.441 --> 00:36:06.830
<v Speaker 4>replay replay and the same song.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I flew from the south.</v>

817
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:11.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm from San Francisco to New York once </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the entire flight actually la,</v>

818
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.553
<v Speaker 4>La and New York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The entire flight I listened to Ozzy </v>

819
00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.073
<v Speaker 4>Osborne,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy train the entire flight while I </v>

820
00:36:18.481 --> 00:36:19.314
<v Speaker 4>was writing.</v>

821
00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:20.183
<v Speaker 2>Just I just kept playing it over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again and do it with a </v>

822
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:23.514
<v Speaker 2>fixed playlist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually pick about seven to 10 songs </v>

823
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:29.280
<v Speaker 2>and for her book and I usually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's usually two different playlists for</v>

824
00:36:29.281 --> 00:36:30.114
<v Speaker 2>the first half of the book will be one </v>
<v Speaker 2>playlist and then they'll start to fail </v>

825
00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:33.474
<v Speaker 2>and I can sort of feel like the Jews to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go on and I'll have to find a whole </v>

826
00:36:36.451 --> 00:36:41.190
<v Speaker 2>bunch to the woo woo magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

827
00:36:41.191 --> 00:36:41.950
<v Speaker 2>There's something</v>

828
00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:42.783
<v Speaker 4>about songs to where sometimes I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>listening to music when I'm writing and </v>

829
00:36:45.071 --> 00:36:47.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm listening to this music too much.</v>

830
00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:50.260
<v Speaker 4>I can't pay attention to what I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've got to shut it off.</v>

831
00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.390
<v Speaker 4>And then I can get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

832
00:36:52.391 --> 00:36:55.130
<v Speaker 4>get into a state sometimes where I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 4>even hearing the words,</v>

833
00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:58.180
<v Speaker 4>like the music is almost just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

834
00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:00.800
<v Speaker 4>like a fuel or something or like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

835
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:05.500
<v Speaker 4>like some sort of a motivating factor </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not really totally taking in.</v>

836
00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.020
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm aware of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not addressing it.</v>

837
00:37:08.021 --> 00:37:08.854
<v Speaker 4>I'm not really focusing on the lyrics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just sorta like riding the head dod </v>

838
00:37:12.571 --> 00:37:16.150
<v Speaker 4>and the beat is kind of driving me in </v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a weird way.</v>

839
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:20.380
<v Speaker 2>Also find my latest book stealing fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that's out in February,</v>

840
00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:22.840
<v Speaker 2>most of the writing that I had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner.</v>

841
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:24.480
<v Speaker 2>So he did something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

842
00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.960
<v Speaker 2>But most of that book was written to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amanda Palmer's cover of Nick Cave's the</v>

843
00:37:28.961 --> 00:37:32.330
<v Speaker 2>ship song over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

844
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:37.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who Amanda Palmer is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who nick cave is either.</v>

845
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.020
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bad person.</v>

846
00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.480
<v Speaker 2>I was at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're a bad person.</v>

847
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Who is Amanda Palmer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

848
00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:43.620
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She uh,</v>

849
00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:45.670
<v Speaker 2>married to Neil Gaiman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the writer.</v>

850
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:50.140
<v Speaker 2>I know that guy is seen him on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amanda's on twitter too.</v>

851
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:53.300
<v Speaker 2>She's just a singer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>songwriter,</v>

852
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:59.600
<v Speaker 4>psychoactive substances or anything that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people do that could enhance creativity.</v>

853
00:38:00.841 --> 00:38:01.674
<v Speaker 4>Is there like a proven thing that Keith </v>
<v Speaker 4>or enhanced flow state or enhanced </v>

854
00:38:05.101 --> 00:38:05.934
<v Speaker 4>creativity?</v>

855
00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:09.980
<v Speaker 2>So there's a couple different ways to </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer this question.</v>

856
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

857
00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:18.300
<v Speaker 2>So neurobiologically we know for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

858
00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.610
<v Speaker 2>so let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

859
00:38:19.611 --> 00:38:21.790
<v Speaker 2>creative is a really fricking fuzzy </v>
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>

860
00:38:21.791 --> 00:38:22.624
<v Speaker 2>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put some meat around it for </v>

861
00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:24.884
<v Speaker 2>starters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are lots of different styles of </v>

862
00:38:27.231 --> 00:38:28.640
<v Speaker 2>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>types of creativity,</v>

863
00:38:28.641 --> 00:38:29.391
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

864
00:38:29.391 --> 00:38:33.530
<v Speaker 2>but usually not 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but usually what you're talking about is</v>

865
00:38:33.531 --> 00:38:36.400
<v Speaker 2>the brain taking in more or different</v>

866
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.233
<v Speaker 3>information per second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then finding connections between </v>

867
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:43.180
<v Speaker 3>this new incoming information and older </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

868
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.670
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've got information acquisition on</v>

869
00:38:45.671 --> 00:38:46.504
<v Speaker 3>the front end and you've got pattern </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognition which is closely related </v>

870
00:38:49.301 --> 00:38:50.134
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finding connections with lateral </v>

871
00:38:51.341 --> 00:38:54.340
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is far flung ideas.</v>

872
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:57.580
<v Speaker 3>And then on the back end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually you have to.</v>

873
00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.830
<v Speaker 3>Creativity involves making it public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

874
00:38:59.831 --> 00:39:00.664
<v Speaker 3>You gotta have some courage and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>bravery on the back and we got to take </v>

875
00:39:04.151 --> 00:39:06.070
<v Speaker 3>it out into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to me,</v>

876
00:39:06.071 --> 00:39:08.500
<v Speaker 3>when we talk about creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the process.</v>

877
00:39:08.501 --> 00:39:10.840
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to tell you about </v>
<v Speaker 3>amplifying creativity,</v>

878
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:14.920
<v Speaker 3>will you have a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>places you can intercept in the chain?</v>

879
00:39:14.921 --> 00:39:15.754
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when we have norepinephrine and </v>

880
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:23.590
<v Speaker 3>dopamine in our system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it internally,</v>

881
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.410
<v Speaker 3>we get nor up effort and dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're focusing chemicals.</v>

882
00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.770
<v Speaker 3>Dope means shows up whenever we link </v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns together also.</v>

883
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:30.603
<v Speaker 3>So you've done a crossword puzzle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get an answer to that little </v>

884
00:39:32.291 --> 00:39:34.240
<v Speaker 3>rush of pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's dopamine,</v>

885
00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:39.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm more norepinephrine and dopamine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only do you take in more information</v>

886
00:39:39.011 --> 00:39:41.250
<v Speaker 3>per second when they're in your system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you also,</v>

887
00:39:41.251 --> 00:39:42.084
<v Speaker 3>they also amplify pattern recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They lower signal to noise ratios is </v>

888
00:39:45.521 --> 00:39:46.354
<v Speaker 3>what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we notice more patterns and mine </v>

889
00:39:48.671 --> 00:39:50.890
<v Speaker 3>which is the psychoactive inside of </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana,</v>

890
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:55.780
<v Speaker 3>amplifies lateral thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long distance connections,</v>

891
00:39:55.781 --> 00:39:56.614
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a bunch of different </v>

892
00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.800
<v Speaker 3>chemicals that will show up and help you</v>
<v Speaker 3>take risks.</v>

893
00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:00.903
<v Speaker 3>All these chemicals can produce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be produced internally or dodge if </v>

894
00:40:05.141 --> 00:40:06.490
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I always say,</v>

895
00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

896
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.233
<v Speaker 3>only you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess there are more states you can </v>

897
00:40:11.081 --> 00:40:14.500
<v Speaker 3>now do this in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a really cheap flow hack is an won't</v>

898
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:17.230
<v Speaker 3>work over time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you go for a 20 minute,</v>

899
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.330
<v Speaker 3>25 minute run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low grade Ron,</v>

900
00:40:19.331 --> 00:40:21.730
<v Speaker 3>you're inducing exercise induced </v>
<v Speaker 3>transient hypofrontality,</v>

901
00:40:21.731 --> 00:40:24.070
<v Speaker 3>we talked about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>followed by a cup of coffee,</v>

902
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.073
<v Speaker 3>followed by a joint and you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially mimic the majority of the </v>

903
00:40:29.501 --> 00:40:31.840
<v Speaker 3>neurochemistry that shows up in a flow </v>
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

904
00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.320
<v Speaker 3>So it's an artificial flow state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can,</v>

905
00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.820
<v Speaker 3>you can do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do it with a,</v>

906
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go for a run and you know,</v>

907
00:40:38.441 --> 00:40:39.274
<v Speaker 3>do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do the same thing if you go for </v>

908
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:44.290
<v Speaker 3>I'll do something and I do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dogs,</v>

909
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:45.124
<v Speaker 3>the dog sanctuary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to put them in flow because all </v>

910
00:40:46.301 --> 00:40:47.134
<v Speaker 3>these same neurochemicals boost your </v>
<v Speaker 3>immune system and reset your nervous </v>

911
00:40:50.201 --> 00:40:52.030
<v Speaker 3>system a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we work with very,</v>

912
00:40:52.031 --> 00:40:55.400
<v Speaker 3>very sick animals and so flow is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>beneficial.</v>

913
00:40:55.401 --> 00:40:56.234
<v Speaker 3>That really extend pet lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've discovered we do this thing where </v>

914
00:40:59.201 --> 00:41:00.034
<v Speaker 3>we'll hike for like half an hour or so </v>
<v Speaker 3>again to get to the point where low </v>

915
00:41:03.281 --> 00:41:04.114
<v Speaker 3>grade exercise induced just handwritten </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypofrontality and then we will sprint </v>

916
00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:07.923
<v Speaker 3>up a cliff or up a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like a five to seven minutes </v>

917
00:41:10.771 --> 00:41:13.840
<v Speaker 3>sprint just long enough to get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>endorphins going.</v>

918
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.490
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get that pain relief.</v>

919
00:41:15.491 --> 00:41:17.950
<v Speaker 3>You sort of know you've gotten there </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get in the pain relief,</v>

920
00:41:17.951 --> 00:41:18.784
<v Speaker 3>so the cycle gets you sort of end to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>low grade flow state and then you're </v>

921
00:41:22.391 --> 00:41:23.224
<v Speaker 3>going to add endorphins in by pushing </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself physically for like five to </v>

922
00:41:25.571 --> 00:41:28.810
<v Speaker 3>seven minutes and then I turn around </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the top of the cliff and I run back</v>

923
00:41:28.811 --> 00:41:29.644
<v Speaker 3>down the cliff face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a big risk and gets a bunch of </v>

924
00:41:32.081 --> 00:41:35.120
<v Speaker 3>dopamine into your system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And usually by the time I hit the bottom</v>

925
00:41:35.121 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 3>of that cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a flow state.</v>

926
00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:40.970
<v Speaker 3>So like if I'm trying to solve a puzzle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a writing puzzle and I can't solve it,</v>

927
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:42.470
<v Speaker 3>I will get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call it a flow hike.</v>

928
00:41:42.471 --> 00:41:43.304
<v Speaker 3>I won't go out and do this exact format.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And usually by the time mom hiking home </v>

929
00:41:47.421 --> 00:41:49.910
<v Speaker 3>with the dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the answers are starting to come.</v>

930
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:51.343
<v Speaker 3>Hello.</v>

931
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:52.543
<v Speaker 4>Now we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we'd be remiss if we didn't go </v>

932
00:41:54.531 --> 00:41:58.640
<v Speaker 4>back to what Sam was talking about where</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was talking about his streak shooting</v>

933
00:41:58.641 --> 00:42:00.980
<v Speaker 4>and comparing streaks to shooting just </v>
<v Speaker 4>flow state,</v>

934
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:03.530
<v Speaker 4>which I think is kind of very different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

935
00:42:03.531 --> 00:42:07.160
<v Speaker 4>Because street shooting has some pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>definitive results.</v>

936
00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.940
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's very repeatable or you're,</v>

937
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:11.720
<v Speaker 4>you're doing the same thing over and </v>
<v Speaker 4>over again.</v>

938
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:15.170
<v Speaker 4>He's shooting a ball into a net and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not an easy thing to do.</v>

939
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:18.200
<v Speaker 4>And statistically when someone's in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>flow state,</v>

940
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.190
<v Speaker 4>they're not more successful or</v>

941
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.370
<v Speaker 3>they think is a flow state or in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>zone.</v>

942
00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.010
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>point out and I like,</v>

943
00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:26.253
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that same data and I have a </v>

944
00:42:28.371 --> 00:42:29.204
<v Speaker 3>hard time believing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't actually make a whole </v>

945
00:42:31.251 --> 00:42:32.990
<v Speaker 3>lot of sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not anomalous finding.</v>

946
00:42:32.991 --> 00:42:35.390
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting for that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know people go on streaks,</v>

947
00:42:35.391 --> 00:42:36.224
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want what I like when I talk </v>

948
00:42:37.551 --> 00:42:38.570
<v Speaker 3>about flow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

949
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.733
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's got what I mean we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's defined as an optimal state of </v>

950
00:42:41.841 --> 00:42:44.060
<v Speaker 3>consciousness where we feel our best and</v>
<v Speaker 3>perform our best.</v>

951
00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:45.590
<v Speaker 3>There's more words we can layer under </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

952
00:42:45.591 --> 00:42:49.550
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm talking about specifically </v>
<v Speaker 3>is specific changes in brain function.</v>

953
00:42:49.551 --> 00:42:52.100
<v Speaker 3>You're getting prefrontal cortex is </v>
<v Speaker 3>turning down.</v>

954
00:42:52.101 --> 00:42:52.934
<v Speaker 3>You're getting five or six </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurochemicals that tend to show up in </v>

955
00:42:55.101 --> 00:42:55.934
<v Speaker 3>your brainwaves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped down to the Alpha Theta </v>

956
00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:58.220
<v Speaker 3>borderline.</v>

957
00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.950
<v Speaker 3>So when somebody tells me they're in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>zone,</v>

958
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.290
<v Speaker 3>we don't have a biophysical based flow </v>
<v Speaker 3>detector yet.</v>

959
00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:08.000
<v Speaker 3>There's we're working on one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam Gozali at CCSF is working alone,</v>

960
00:43:08.001 --> 00:43:10.250
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't exist yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So right now if I want to know if you're</v>

961
00:43:10.251 --> 00:43:11.084
<v Speaker 3>in flow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to give you a subjective </v>

962
00:43:12.111 --> 00:43:14.090
<v Speaker 3>questionnaire is extremely well </v>
<v Speaker 3>validated.</v>

963
00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:17.060
<v Speaker 3>We've got like 50 years of research </v>
<v Speaker 3>around it works,</v>

964
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:18.283
<v Speaker 3>but it's still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way to like look at that and </v>

965
00:43:20.031 --> 00:43:22.860
<v Speaker 3>say okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person is in deep flow or not,</v>

966
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:23.783
<v Speaker 3>so we don't have that way to do it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't don't quite know how we do </v>

967
00:43:26.901 --> 00:43:29.570
<v Speaker 3>this research yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's something that's interesting.</v>

968
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:30.530
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

969
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:31.363
<v Speaker 4>do they know what a flow state is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying that they don't have the </v>

970
00:43:34.131 --> 00:43:37.520
<v Speaker 4>exact ability to test it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but would it,</v>

971
00:43:37.521 --> 00:43:40.700
<v Speaker 4>what would they use with the use f MRI </v>
<v Speaker 4>or some sort of a new technology?</v>

972
00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:44.640
<v Speaker 3>People have done it 100 different ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is stuff I talk about in,</v>

973
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:47.510
<v Speaker 3>in rise of superman primarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

974
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.823
<v Speaker 3>so there's Eg work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right where they're looking at brain </v>

975
00:43:51.711 --> 00:43:54.920
<v Speaker 3>waves that sort of goes back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the sixties.</v>

976
00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.793
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was at that point they just </v>

977
00:43:57.081 --> 00:43:57.914
<v Speaker 3>thought it was alpha waves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you're quick primer on </v>

978
00:44:01.611 --> 00:44:03.860
<v Speaker 3>brainwaves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal waking consciousness,</v>

979
00:44:03.861 --> 00:44:05.590
<v Speaker 3>where are we right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beta?</v>

980
00:44:05.591 --> 00:44:08.570
<v Speaker 3>It's a fast moving wave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just means that we're talking,</v>

981
00:44:08.571 --> 00:44:10.880
<v Speaker 3>we're thinking we're engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alpha,</v>

982
00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:13.400
<v Speaker 3>which is right below that is daydreaming</v>
<v Speaker 3>mode.</v>

983
00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.120
<v Speaker 3>It's where you sort of flitting from </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought to thought without much internal</v>

984
00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:20.210
<v Speaker 3>resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Theta is below that data.</v>

985
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:25.240
<v Speaker 3>We only tend to drop into in rem sleep </v>
<v Speaker 3>or say hypnagogic state or which is when</v>

986
00:44:27.321 --> 00:44:28.430
<v Speaker 3>you're falling asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

987
00:44:28.431 --> 00:44:30.380
<v Speaker 3>That weird state where you're falling </v>
<v Speaker 3>asleep and you think,</v>

988
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that looks like a gray elephant.</v>

989
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.023
<v Speaker 2>And then turns into a grey sweater and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it turns into a great camry pub a </v>

990
00:44:36.031 --> 00:44:37.320
<v Speaker 2>lot that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goget state,</v>

991
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:39.750
<v Speaker 2>that's data as a general rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

992
00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:43.320
<v Speaker 2>so flow takes place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to think it was just alpha.</v>

993
00:44:43.321 --> 00:44:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Now they think it's the borderline </v>
<v Speaker 2>between Alpha Theta.</v>

994
00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:49.140
<v Speaker 2>But we've gotten very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very precise with Eg.</v>

995
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.033
<v Speaker 2>Eg was one of these things we thought we</v>
<v Speaker 2>could sort of measure it for a long </v>

996
00:44:52.141 --> 00:44:52.974
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the past 10 years it's gotten </v>

997
00:44:53.881 --> 00:44:54.930
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very robust.</v>

998
00:44:54.931 --> 00:44:57.600
<v Speaker 2>We have a pretty good look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

999
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:00.430
<v Speaker 2>what people's brands are doing in flow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've also used FMRI.</v>

1000
00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:04.020
<v Speaker 2>The best work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cool work is Charles Limb,</v>

1001
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:07.920
<v Speaker 2>he's at Johns Hopkins and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got all kinds of talks.</v>

1002
00:45:07.921 --> 00:45:09.310
<v Speaker 2>You can find them online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1003
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.110
<v Speaker 2>executive a Ted talk about this work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did something really cool he took,</v>

1004
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:13.944
<v Speaker 2>he started with jazz musicians and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>built a keyboard with no metal in it so </v>

1005
00:45:17.251 --> 00:45:19.080
<v Speaker 2>they can put it inside the f Mri.</v>

1006
00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:23.250
<v Speaker 2>And then he visualized the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the brain of a professional jazz</v>

1007
00:45:23.251 --> 00:45:24.084
<v Speaker 2>musician playing a standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing the same notes over and over </v>

1008
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:27.323
<v Speaker 2>versus improvising in a flow state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we got to start to see what the </v>

1009
00:45:30.541 --> 00:45:31.374
<v Speaker 2>differences are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This work has sort of been extended a </v>

1010
00:45:34.171 --> 00:45:36.540
<v Speaker 2>little bit by a guy named Judd brewer at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yale.</v>

1011
00:45:36.541 --> 00:45:38.320
<v Speaker 2>He's also worked on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1012
00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:39.203
<v Speaker 2>he's looked at flow and meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's found some slightly different </v>

1013
00:45:41.791 --> 00:45:43.530
<v Speaker 2>things than Charles limb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1014
00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:46.050
<v Speaker 2>So it's a combination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll keep really,</v>

1015
00:45:46.051 --> 00:45:46.884
<v Speaker 2>really need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the neurochemistry that I think is </v>

1016
00:45:49.141 --> 00:45:52.860
<v Speaker 2>going to unlock this puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of that stuff takes place deep</v>

1017
00:45:52.861 --> 00:45:55.410
<v Speaker 2>in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really our imaging technology isn't</v>

1018
00:45:55.411 --> 00:45:56.244
<v Speaker 2>quite there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's starting to get there and probably </v>

1019
00:45:57.991 --> 00:45:58.970
<v Speaker 2>will be there him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1020
00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:01.530
<v Speaker 2>three to four years because this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>is advancing so quickly.</v>

1021
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.420
<v Speaker 2>But we haven't put the whole puzzle </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1022
00:46:03.421 --> 00:46:04.254
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you these five or six </v>

1023
00:46:06.031 --> 00:46:06.864
<v Speaker 2>neurochemicals show up in flow states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I tell you the order that they show </v>

1024
00:46:10.141 --> 00:46:10.790
<v Speaker 2>up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I tell it?</v>

1025
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Do we know if the order that you drop </v>
<v Speaker 2>into flow versus how I drop in?</v>

1026
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Are they the same?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they the different.</v>

1027
00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:18.510
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so fascinating.</v>

1028
00:46:18.511 --> 00:46:19.344
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's taking place behind a </v>

1029
00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:23.490
<v Speaker 2>wall and we know what's going on over </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1030
00:46:23.491 --> 00:46:25.620
<v Speaker 2>but we just don't know exactly what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1031
00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.530
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the things I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>often,</v>

1032
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.090
<v Speaker 2>I've discovered about science and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1033
00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:31.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of learned this the hard way </v>

1034
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:32.694
<v Speaker 2>coming up as a science writer is I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>always stunned by how much we don't </v>

1035
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:40.430
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really basic basics.</v>

1036
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.720
<v Speaker 2>A lot of really basic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple questions.</v>

1037
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.630
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's even thought to ask them yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's really,</v>

1038
00:46:45.631 --> 00:46:47.700
<v Speaker 2>it's really astounding to me how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1039
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:49.980
<v Speaker 2>how little we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much more we need to know,</v>

1040
00:46:49.981 --> 00:46:51.360
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really with stuff that,</v>

1041
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:52.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people speak very,</v>

1042
00:46:52.711 --> 00:46:54.750
<v Speaker 2>very learned Lee and authoritatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1043
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:57.040
<v Speaker 2>and you start poking and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1044
00:46:57.041 --> 00:46:59.850
<v Speaker 2>we don't even know the very basics here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>

1045
00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is consciousness?</v>

1046
00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.570
<v Speaker 2>We know if you're conscious one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1047
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:06.673
<v Speaker 2>I mean that isn't that the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What separates people from almost </v>

1048
00:47:09.331 --> 00:47:12.900
<v Speaker 2>anything else is that they're aware of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on and they can communicate</v>

1049
00:47:12.901 --> 00:47:15.060
<v Speaker 2>it and they're here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're conscious,</v>

1050
00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:17.490
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not just conscious,</v>

1051
00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:18.683
<v Speaker 2>but they're somehow or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm imparting my consciousness in your </v>

1052
00:47:22.051 --> 00:47:22.884
<v Speaker 2>head and you're imparting yours into </v>
<v Speaker 2>mine and I'm bouncing your thoughts </v>

1053
00:47:25.351 --> 00:47:26.400
<v Speaker 2>around and try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1054
00:47:26.401 --> 00:47:27.540
<v Speaker 2>I see where he's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1055
00:47:27.541 --> 00:47:29.160
<v Speaker 2>I see where he's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1056
00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.260
<v Speaker 2>where?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's</v>

1057
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 4>that coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You talking about theory of mind,</v>

1058
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:34.383
<v Speaker 4>which is interesting because they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>starting to believe that a lot of a lot </v>

1059
00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:37.514
<v Speaker 4>of mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>health also have theory of mind is not </v>

1060
00:47:38.531 --> 00:47:39.520
<v Speaker 4>just humans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1061
00:47:39.521 --> 00:47:44.521
<v Speaker 4>The dividing line between like what is </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinctly human at this point is really</v>

1062
00:47:44.741 --> 00:47:45.574
<v Speaker 4>thin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've only found a couple of things </v>

1063
00:47:47.201 --> 00:47:48.034
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Robert Sapolsky at Stanford talks about </v>

1064
00:47:50.021 --> 00:47:51.190
<v Speaker 4>this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's great.</v>

1065
00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:56.460
<v Speaker 4>He thinks the only two things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>separate humans that lower species can't</v>

1066
00:47:57.161 --> 00:47:57.994
<v Speaker 4>do what is distinctly human is our </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to delay gratification super </v>

1067
00:48:03.161 --> 00:48:04.630
<v Speaker 4>longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we have religion,</v>

1068
00:48:04.631 --> 00:48:06.880
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You we're willing to delay gratification</v>

1069
00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:08.830
<v Speaker 4>until after I'm dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1070
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.870
<v Speaker 4>This life socks and then you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to heaven.</v>

1071
00:48:10.871 --> 00:48:13.050
<v Speaker 4>So we're willing to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we also have,</v>

1072
00:48:13.051 --> 00:48:13.884
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability to synthesize opposing </v>

1073
00:48:16.511 --> 00:48:17.021
<v Speaker 4>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1074
00:48:17.021 --> 00:48:17.854
<v Speaker 4>They can galleon dialectic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can take this thing over here on this </v>

1075
00:48:20.201 --> 00:48:21.034
<v Speaker 4>side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this thing over here on this and put it </v>

1076
00:48:22.151 --> 00:48:26.350
<v Speaker 4>together and synthesize new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which most animals don't seem to be able</v>

1077
00:48:26.351 --> 00:48:27.040
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>

1078
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 4>But everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we pretty much found.</v>

1079
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.513
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't language one of the big ones </v>

1080
00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:35.080
<v Speaker 4>because with the law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think most animals are,</v>

1081
00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:38.200
<v Speaker 4>even if they're aware and their </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and even if they have some</v>

1082
00:48:38.201 --> 00:48:39.034
<v Speaker 4>sort of a crude form of communication,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they really lack is the ability to </v>

1083
00:48:42.131 --> 00:48:42.964
<v Speaker 4>understand how the other person thinks </v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're talking to me and this is </v>

1084
00:48:45.821 --> 00:48:47.740
<v Speaker 4>the first time we've met and we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking and I'm,</v>

1085
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:52.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting inside your head even from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole coffee should be black,</v>

1086
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:53.303
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you have your methodology for the </v>

1087
00:48:55.181 --> 00:48:56.830
<v Speaker 4>rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm drinking black coffee.</v>

1088
00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:58.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>

1089
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.850
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1090
00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:00.740
<v Speaker 4>but it's like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1091
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:04.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm seeing how you think and what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I try to do,</v>

1092
00:49:04.661 --> 00:49:05.494
<v Speaker 4>at least is when I'm talking to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to sort of empty my head out and </v>

1093
00:49:09.011 --> 00:49:10.930
<v Speaker 4>let them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let them get in my head.</v>

1094
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.090
<v Speaker 4>Like I would try to think like you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>

1095
00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:14.253
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when I think I've always said that </v>

1096
00:49:16.331 --> 00:49:17.164
<v Speaker 4>that's what's happening in an audience </v>
<v Speaker 4>when someone's on stage and they're </v>

1097
00:49:19.361 --> 00:49:21.850
<v Speaker 4>killing when a comedian is on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if someone,</v>

1098
00:49:21.851 --> 00:49:22.684
<v Speaker 4>if uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm watching someone I think is </v>

1099
00:49:23.261 --> 00:49:24.910
<v Speaker 4>really funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like bill burr or something like that,</v>

1100
00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.590
<v Speaker 4>I give my brain to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get like,</v>

1101
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:30.310
<v Speaker 4>like go ahead and take me on a ride.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when,</v>

1102
00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.173
<v Speaker 4>when he's on stage and he's killing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sort of like letting him think for </v>

1103
00:49:35.201 --> 00:49:36.034
<v Speaker 4>me and I'm not questioning or taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>things down other paths or allowing </v>

1104
00:49:41.681 --> 00:49:46.390
<v Speaker 4>myself to also think about my bills or I</v>
<v Speaker 4>got to get gas before I go home.</v>

1105
00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:49.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm just thinking what he's providing </v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

1106
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:50.453
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this and that ability is </v>

1107
00:49:52.331 --> 00:49:53.164
<v Speaker 4>uniquely human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ability to try to understand how </v>

1108
00:49:55.841 --> 00:49:57.700
<v Speaker 4>another person is communicating and </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>

1109
00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.500
<v Speaker 4>And then I started taking it into </v>
<v Speaker 4>variables.</v>

1110
00:49:59.501 --> 00:50:00.420
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like W,</v>

1111
00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:03.340
<v Speaker 4>especially now that I'm a father over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the last,</v>

1112
00:50:03.341 --> 00:50:04.174
<v Speaker 4>this last quarter of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've really concentrated on the concept </v>

1113
00:50:08.471 --> 00:50:11.560
<v Speaker 4>of everybody used to be a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I was young and single.</v>

1114
00:50:11.561 --> 00:50:15.580
<v Speaker 4>That was everyone was static.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That old lady's always been an old lady.</v>

1115
00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.890
<v Speaker 4>That'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's always been an old dude.</v>

1116
00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.500
<v Speaker 4>Now once I had a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once,</v>

1117
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:21.633
<v Speaker 4>you know from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from then on when I'm raising my </v>

1118
00:50:23.801 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 4>children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people now are babies that grew up.</v>

1119
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.233
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's a baby that became an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see some crazy old man with a big </v>

1120
00:50:31.911 --> 00:50:34.340
<v Speaker 2>fucking WC fields knows and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking and like,</v>

1121
00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:36.350
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy was a baby at one point in time</v>

1122
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:39.320
<v Speaker 2>and I've forced myself to go down that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a path.</v>

1123
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.760
<v Speaker 2>So I think that the ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1124
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:47.800
<v Speaker 2>to think how other people think and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of commiserate with each other in a</v>

1125
00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:51.470
<v Speaker 2>very broad and expansive way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a very uniquely human.</v>

1126
00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to under.</v>

1127
00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean the more we figure out about like</v>
<v Speaker 2>whale language,</v>

1128
00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.190
<v Speaker 2>Dolphin language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1129
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:59.840
<v Speaker 2>There's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

1130
00:50:59.841 --> 00:51:01.790
<v Speaker 2>if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be able to dig it up.</v>

1131
00:51:01.791 --> 00:51:02.624
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy I want to say is that </v>

1132
00:51:03.111 --> 00:51:06.350
<v Speaker 2>northern Arizona University who worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>on prairie dog language.</v>

1133
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:08.810
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy research,</v>

1134
00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:13.040
<v Speaker 2>so one of the reasons we've never been </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to study animal communication,</v>

1135
00:51:13.041 --> 00:51:13.874
<v Speaker 2>and I could screw this up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll try it is we couldn't talk </v>

1136
00:51:17.691 --> 00:51:18.230
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1137
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:19.063
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what he did is he recorded a ton of </v>

1138
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:23.833
<v Speaker 2>prairie dog communication and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>started sort of decoding what little </v>

1139
00:51:26.961 --> 00:51:30.470
<v Speaker 2>things mean and but used a computer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>play it back to them.</v>

1140
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:34.790
<v Speaker 2>So what he discovered is prairie dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you don't think of as particularly</v>

1141
00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:35.624
<v Speaker 2>intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they'd started decoding their </v>

1142
00:51:36.771 --> 00:51:37.604
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started to realize that prairie </v>

1143
00:51:38.271 --> 00:51:41.300
<v Speaker 2>dogs routinely say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1144
00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.253
<v Speaker 2>be careful of that right path over there</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a fat guy in a purple </v>

1145
00:51:45.351 --> 00:51:46.184
<v Speaker 2>sweater coming this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That detailed like in the beginning of </v>

1146
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:49.610
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1147
00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:53.510
<v Speaker 2>they used to think animals only sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicated in like nouns and verbs.</v>

1148
00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:56.240
<v Speaker 2>Present tense nouns and verbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1149
00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1150
00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:58.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some certain calls that are </v>

1151
00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:00.690
<v Speaker 2>monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monkeys right now,</v>

1152
00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:04.610
<v Speaker 2>the three calls now they're starting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize they've got adjectives,</v>

1153
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:05.653
<v Speaker 2>they've got tenses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can think in the for a while they </v>

1154
00:52:07.581 --> 00:52:09.620
<v Speaker 2>thought animals lived in a perpetual </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasant,</v>

1155
00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:10.513
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1156
00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:14.600
<v Speaker 2>Like the argument was all animals are </v>
<v Speaker 2>always in flow bright,</v>

1157
00:52:14.601 --> 00:52:15.434
<v Speaker 2>which is the effort focused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything in the now it turns out </v>

1158
00:52:17.241 --> 00:52:18.790
<v Speaker 2>that's not the case at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have passed,</v>

1159
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.633
<v Speaker 2>they have futures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We asked this question a lot running an </v>

1160
00:52:22.251 --> 00:52:25.340
<v Speaker 2>animal sanctuary because if we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're caring for a dog,</v>

1161
00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:28.520
<v Speaker 2>it's not just older special needs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's compromise shelter.</v>

1162
00:52:28.521 --> 00:52:29.354
<v Speaker 2>It was on death row is probably if it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up with us because we work with </v>

1163
00:52:31.731 --> 00:52:33.890
<v Speaker 2>the worst of the worst of the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been very,</v>

1164
00:52:33.891 --> 00:52:35.350
<v Speaker 2>very badly abused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

1165
00:52:35.351 --> 00:52:36.184
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the question my wife and I always </v>

1166
00:52:37.581 --> 00:52:40.520
<v Speaker 2>used to talk about was do they know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they like,</v>

1167
00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:42.620
<v Speaker 2>do they feel grateful to us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they,</v>

1168
00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.080
<v Speaker 2>can they remember their past enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that you know,</v>

1169
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:48.290
<v Speaker 2>the president is different and we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were.</v>

1170
00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:50.570
<v Speaker 2>What was different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like those kinds of questions and after,</v>

1171
00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:51.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

1172
00:52:51.381 --> 00:52:53.390
<v Speaker 2>12 years of doing this work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard core,</v>

1173
00:52:53.391 --> 00:52:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I think they really know and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1174
00:52:55.641 --> 00:52:57.890
<v Speaker 2>they live in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a timescale that's a lot broader than</v>

1175
00:52:57.891 --> 00:52:58.724
<v Speaker 2>we've given them credit for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This work that's been done on prairie </v>

1176
00:53:01.881 --> 00:53:03.830
<v Speaker 2>dogs is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had been done on any other animals.</v>

1177
00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.780
<v Speaker 2>He knew language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>discover,</v>

1178
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:08.480
<v Speaker 2>prairie doggies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a radio lab episode.</v>

1179
00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Powerful radiolab from 2011.</v>

1180
00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Radial abs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking awesome.</v>

1181
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:15.043
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't listened to that podcast </v>

1182
00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:18.800
<v Speaker 2>as folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of my all time favorites.</v>

1183
00:53:18.801 --> 00:53:21.830
<v Speaker 2>I've learned so much from that show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's incredible.</v>

1184
00:53:21.831 --> 00:53:24.170
<v Speaker 2>They can tell you the color of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes.</v>

1185
00:53:24.171 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 2>They have a noise for the color.</v>

1186
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:28.620
<v Speaker 4>Fuck nate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1187
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.513
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it changes the way you think about </v>

1188
00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:32.730
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1189
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:33.600
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1190
00:53:33.601 --> 00:53:37.260
<v Speaker 4>Well the dolphin one is really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dolphins.</v>

1191
00:53:37.261 --> 00:53:41.580
<v Speaker 4>I've found out recently that the babies </v>
<v Speaker 4>come up with their own names.</v>

1192
00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:42.773
<v Speaker 4>They come up with names for each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the mother will say something to </v>

1193
00:53:45.001 --> 00:53:47.000
<v Speaker 4>them and then the baby will say </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that.</v>

1194
00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:47.843
<v Speaker 4>And then the mother will repeat that and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the baby will choose that as a name </v>

1195
00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.370
<v Speaker 4>Dolphin's name themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1196
00:53:53.371 --> 00:53:55.560
<v Speaker 4>They named themselves baby's name </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

1197
00:53:55.561 --> 00:53:57.900
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine if we like human </v>
<v Speaker 4>babies named themselves again?</v>

1198
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:00.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I mean,</v>

1199
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:01.920
<v Speaker 4>dolphins all sound like babies,</v>

1200
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.983
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1201
00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.350
<v Speaker 4>they don't really have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's sort of like eating,</v>

1202
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:10.010
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1203
00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dolphin cognitive chairman sounds.</v>

1204
00:54:12.371 --> 00:54:13.041
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1205
00:54:13.041 --> 00:54:14.030
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's such.</v>

1206
00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.073
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the weirdest things about </v>
<v Speaker 4>people's that distinctly different </v>

1207
00:54:17.061 --> 00:54:19.280
<v Speaker 4>sounds that we have geographically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1208
00:54:19.281 --> 00:54:24.281
<v Speaker 4>Middle Eastern has a German,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has a lot of the guttural sort of.</v>

1209
00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:28.430
<v Speaker 4>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>South America is that flow sort of,</v>

1210
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.593
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the beautiful Latin sounds to a lot of </v>

1211
00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:32.630
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way they speak.</v>

1212
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.863
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't really see too much of that </v>

1213
00:54:35.151 --> 00:54:36.920
<v Speaker 4>with dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you do see some of it.</v>

1214
00:54:36.921 --> 00:54:39.050
<v Speaker 4>You definitely see some dialects and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

1215
00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:42.860
<v Speaker 4>some variables.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's always the most fascinating thing</v>

1216
00:54:42.861 --> 00:54:45.110
<v Speaker 4>to me is that we really don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck.</v>

1217
00:54:45.111 --> 00:54:46.700
<v Speaker 4>They're soft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're saying adult.</v>

1218
00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:47.683
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we've been studying it forever and </v>

1219
00:54:49.941 --> 00:54:50.601
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1220
00:54:50.601 --> 00:54:50.960
<v Speaker 4>you've got it.</v>

1221
00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:54.200
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of human arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right in the way.</v>

1222
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:57.380
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of us being full of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ourselves and what I mean,</v>

1223
00:54:57.381 --> 00:54:58.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1224
00:54:58.901 --> 00:55:00.130
<v Speaker 4>we want to believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1225
00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:03.790
<v Speaker 4>they put it in the Bible where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>master of Earth Week and you know we,</v>

1226
00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:05.053
<v Speaker 4>and that's a hell of a lot easier to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>if other species aren't conscious and </v>

1227
00:55:09.021 --> 00:55:12.590
<v Speaker 4>aren't communicating and aren't feeling </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

1228
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:13.483
<v Speaker 4>What's interesting to me is that they've</v>
<v Speaker 4>determined now at least the people that </v>

1229
00:55:17.421 --> 00:55:18.254
<v Speaker 4>are studying a great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great apes that chimps have moved into </v>

1230
00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:21.763
<v Speaker 4>stone age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They believe that chimps are now at the </v>

1231
00:55:23.901 --> 00:55:24.734
<v Speaker 4>beginning stages of the stone age and if</v>
<v Speaker 4>chimps continue to evolve the way they </v>

1232
00:55:29.091 --> 00:55:33.050
<v Speaker 4>have and the way supposedly we have in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>million years from now,</v>

1233
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:34.123
<v Speaker 4>chimps might have fucking houses and </v>
<v Speaker 4>tools and cars and they might be some </v>

1234
00:55:38.151 --> 00:55:40.250
<v Speaker 4>totally new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely different thing.</v>

1235
00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.013
<v Speaker 4>There's some kind of Charlton Heston </v>
<v Speaker 4>joke here just waiting to happen for </v>

1236
00:55:44.631 --> 00:55:45.710
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't get to,</v>

1237
00:55:45.711 --> 00:55:49.490
<v Speaker 4>but I mean it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we did at one point in time,</v>

1238
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:51.740
<v Speaker 4>if we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously we weren't,</v>

1239
00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:55.700
<v Speaker 4>unless you believe in creationism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we weren't born as human beings,</v>

1240
00:55:55.701 --> 00:55:58.550
<v Speaker 4>we weren't invented and there wasn't an </v>
<v Speaker 4>anatomy in eve.</v>

1241
00:55:58.850 --> 00:55:59.683
<v Speaker 4>There was some sort of hominid that </v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually got smarter and through </v>

1242
00:56:03.681 --> 00:56:07.400
<v Speaker 4>natural selection and through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>genetic mutations,</v>

1243
00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:09.283
<v Speaker 4>diet choice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the different variables that they </v>

1244
00:56:10.761 --> 00:56:13.070
<v Speaker 4>think contributed to the human being </v>
<v Speaker 4>becoming a human being,</v>

1245
00:56:13.071 --> 00:56:16.070
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't always that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if a chimp,</v>

1246
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.840
<v Speaker 4>like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we can,</v>

1247
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:19.810
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we observed the meeting tools of,</v>

1248
00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:20.773
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you've seen the famous photo of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rang Tang that's holding onto the </v>

1249
00:56:23.801 --> 00:56:25.270
<v Speaker 4>branch spear fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1250
00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:28.510
<v Speaker 4>Fucking a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That one's a mindblower you like,</v>

1251
00:56:28.511 --> 00:56:31.330
<v Speaker 4>he's got a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's the interesting question,</v>

1252
00:56:31.331 --> 00:56:33.340
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we're probably,</v>

1253
00:56:33.341 --> 00:56:34.174
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've already accelerated evolution </v>

1254
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:36.250
<v Speaker 4>among humans.</v>

1255
00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:40.210
<v Speaker 4>We probably can accelerate it among </v>
<v Speaker 4>other species if we want to.</v>

1256
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.710
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting.</v>

1257
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:42.723
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you think it's happening amongst </v>

1258
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:46.150
<v Speaker 4>humans right now at a spectacular rate </v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

1259
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:47.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's all,</v>

1260
00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:48.663
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>technical physio evolution is a Robert </v>

1261
00:56:52.271 --> 00:56:53.750
<v Speaker 4>Fogle's term from timbers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1262
00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:56.680
<v Speaker 4>physio evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He came out of the University of Chicago</v>

1263
00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:58.480
<v Speaker 4>still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an economist.</v>

1264
00:56:58.730 --> 00:56:59.850
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and tech,</v>

1265
00:56:59.851 --> 00:57:00.684
<v Speaker 4>the physio evolution is his term for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that we've massively sped up </v>

1266
00:57:04.511 --> 00:57:05.860
<v Speaker 4>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1267
00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:06.813
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1268
00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:08.830
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting because if you look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>his work,</v>

1269
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:10.930
<v Speaker 4>it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing fancy.</v>

1270
00:57:10.931 --> 00:57:11.764
<v Speaker 4>It was sanitation systems and a cleaner </v>
<v Speaker 4>water and slightly better food and </v>

1271
00:57:17.111 --> 00:57:18.190
<v Speaker 4>slightly better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1272
00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:19.083
<v Speaker 4>suddenly our lifespan has doubled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now when he's talking about techno </v>

1273
00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:25.570
<v Speaker 4>physio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's only talking about using technology</v>

1274
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:27.433
<v Speaker 4>in terms of like the health benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it medicine or is he talking about are </v>

1275
00:57:30.791 --> 00:57:32.590
<v Speaker 4>interfacing with technology.</v>

1276
00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:36.550
<v Speaker 4>But our interface and we see that to me </v>
<v Speaker 4>is one of the most bizarre ones.</v>

1277
00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:37.653
<v Speaker 4>Talked about this yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was watching another teen movie </v>

1278
00:57:39.671 --> 00:57:41.080
<v Speaker 4>the other night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is just,</v>

1279
00:57:41.081 --> 00:57:42.850
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was writing and sometimes our right to</v>

1280
00:57:42.851 --> 00:57:47.851
<v Speaker 4>keep the TV on just for a goof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was so unbelievably bad and weird</v>

1281
00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:49.603
<v Speaker 4>as I'm moving from 2001 and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a time capsule and I'm watching this </v>

1282
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:58.810
<v Speaker 4>thing and I'm like culturally we are so </v>
<v Speaker 4>far removed that you could not make this</v>

1283
00:57:58.811 --> 00:58:01.210
<v Speaker 4>movie today if you made another teen </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie.</v>

1284
00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:02.044
<v Speaker 4>It's failed with racism and sexism and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people get a guy punches a woman in the </v>

1285
00:58:06.461 --> 00:58:07.294
<v Speaker 4>face and it's like a punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a lot of crazy fucked up </v>

1286
00:58:10.721 --> 00:58:13.540
<v Speaker 4>shit in this movie and obviously it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy and it's parody,</v>

1287
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:17.290
<v Speaker 4>so I'm supposed to be taken literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't even do comedies like that</v>

1288
00:58:17.291 --> 00:58:18.010
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

1289
00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:20.170
<v Speaker 4>Like you watched that movie and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1290
00:58:20.171 --> 00:58:21.004
<v Speaker 4>this is a sign of a time before people </v>
<v Speaker 4>could communicate instantaneously </v>

1291
00:58:23.531 --> 00:58:24.364
<v Speaker 4>online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would happen if you released </v>

1292
00:58:25.871 --> 00:58:28.060
<v Speaker 4>blazing saddles today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

1293
00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:29.700
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

1294
00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:31.480
<v Speaker 4>So let me ask you a question since you </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought it up.</v>

1295
00:58:31.481 --> 00:58:34.690
<v Speaker 4>It's totally off topic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why doesn't comedy age?</v>

1296
00:58:34.691 --> 00:58:36.730
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very good question.</v>

1297
00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:37.773
<v Speaker 4>You know my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if you want to look at like the </v>

1298
00:58:40.601 --> 00:58:42.550
<v Speaker 4>all time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most important comedians,</v>

1299
00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:44.163
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I've always felt like number</v>
<v Speaker 4>one is lenny bruce because lenny bruce </v>

1300
00:58:47.051 --> 00:58:49.600
<v Speaker 4>was getting arrested back when you can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>arrest me.</v>

1301
00:58:49.601 --> 00:58:50.710
<v Speaker 4>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Haven't said Cock sucker.</v>

1302
00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:52.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1303
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:53.823
<v Speaker 4>He had cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we had cultural blinders on and </v>

1304
00:58:56.831 --> 00:59:00.970
<v Speaker 4>we had these notions of things you could</v>
<v Speaker 4>and could not say,</v>

1305
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:03.850
<v Speaker 4>and he shattered those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the ways he did his but going</v>

1306
00:59:03.851 --> 00:59:04.684
<v Speaker 4>to jail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what he was doing was he was </v>

1307
00:59:07.721 --> 00:59:12.210
<v Speaker 4>interfacing with a society and a culture</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was infantile.</v>

1308
00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:16.060
<v Speaker 4>We were childish back then and we are no</v>
<v Speaker 4>longer like that.</v>

1309
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.983
<v Speaker 4>So the things that he was saying that </v>
<v Speaker 4>were naughty and funny are so </v>

1310
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:21.240
<v Speaker 4>commonplace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

1311
00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:26.150
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing funny about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did have some lines though that still</v>

1312
00:59:26.151 --> 00:59:29.420
<v Speaker 4>to this day hold up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one of them was about gay people.</v>

1313
00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:31.310
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me get this straight.</v>

1314
00:59:31.311 --> 00:59:34.070
<v Speaker 4>See if you're gaining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's illegal.</v>

1315
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:36.080
<v Speaker 4>So they do is if you have sex with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1316
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:39.680
<v Speaker 4>they put you in jail where men want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have sex with you.</v>

1317
00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:45.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean this guy fucking nailed that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>like 1960.</v>

1318
00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:47.490
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what in the fuck are you doing?</v>

1319
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:51.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean people have inadvertently stolen </v>
<v Speaker 4>that bit.</v>

1320
00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:53.840
<v Speaker 4>Like reinvented it themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a friend,</v>

1321
00:59:53.841 --> 00:59:55.550
<v Speaker 4>it was a really funny comic who did that</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>

1322
00:59:55.551 --> 00:59:56.384
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

1323
00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:59.060
<v Speaker 4>you need to know Lenny Lenny Bruce did </v>
<v Speaker 4>that night,</v>

1324
00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.050
<v Speaker 4>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sixty two.</v>

1325
01:00:00.051 --> 01:00:01.070
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no fucking way.</v>

1326
01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:01.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1327
01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.390
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was too obvious.</v>

1328
01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.330
<v Speaker 4>It's too obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty funny,</v>

1329
01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:06.980
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the stuff,</v>

1330
01:00:06.981 --> 01:00:08.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know Robin Williams,</v>

1331
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:11.630
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it's not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what he can do with his face,</v>

1332
01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:12.750
<v Speaker 4>Jim Carrey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam,</v>

1333
01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:16.160
<v Speaker 4>like some of the physical stuff seem to </v>
<v Speaker 4>hold up because it's still amazing.</v>

1334
01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:17.390
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck did you do that?</v>

1335
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:21.380
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interestingly Steve Martin's still holds</v>

1336
01:00:21.381 --> 01:00:22.214
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you listen to like let's get </v>

1337
01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:24.980
<v Speaker 4>small leg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still holds.</v>

1338
01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:28.040
<v Speaker 4>It's so silly and a lot of his stuff was</v>
<v Speaker 4>very physical too.</v>

1339
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:31.880
<v Speaker 4>We do the balloon animals on his head </v>
<v Speaker 4>and shit like that when things.</v>

1340
01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:32.843
<v Speaker 4>A lot of Richard Pryor hangs in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of Richard Pryor still holds up </v>

1341
01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.340
<v Speaker 4>some of the standup seems to last a hell</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a lot better than the funny movies.</v>

1342
01:00:40.341 --> 01:00:41.900
<v Speaker 4>Like go back and try to watch some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

1343
01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:47.290
<v Speaker 4>My wife had a very strange childhood so </v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see everything I saw coming up,</v>

1344
01:00:47.631 --> 01:00:48.464
<v Speaker 4>so I showed her everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including all the like Bill Murray </v>

1345
01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:51.913
<v Speaker 4>Movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stripes and all that stuff from back </v>

1346
01:00:52.571 --> 01:00:56.810
<v Speaker 4>when stripes now is a really sad movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>about war.</v>

1347
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:58.023
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean at the time I remember like </v>

1348
01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:02.370
<v Speaker 4>falling off my chair and being under the</v>
<v Speaker 4>seat.</v>

1349
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:03.223
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't even breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was laughing so hard and now I watch </v>

1350
01:01:05.111 --> 01:01:06.440
<v Speaker 4>with my wife and she's looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

1351
01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:08.470
<v Speaker 4>you sure man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is supposed to be funny.</v>

1352
01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:09.201
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1353
01:01:09.201 --> 01:01:10.034
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is.</v>

1354
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.480
<v Speaker 4>It's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's coming.</v>

1355
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:13.250
<v Speaker 4>And it never comes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1356
01:01:13.251 --> 01:01:16.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think that movies are in a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of ways like a slide,</v>

1357
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:19.190
<v Speaker 4>like a slide for a microscope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1358
01:01:19.191 --> 01:01:21.110
<v Speaker 4>we can look at a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1359
01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.730
<v Speaker 4>from a time period like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1360
01:01:22.731 --> 01:01:26.570
<v Speaker 4>this is 2001 another teen movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's look at this under the microscope.</v>

1361
01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:28.760
<v Speaker 4>And you can check out aspects of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>

1362
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch,</v>

1363
01:01:29.961 --> 01:01:34.190
<v Speaker 4>try to watch a father knows best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It becomes a comedy,</v>

1364
01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:39.080
<v Speaker 4>like it's sort of kind of a comedy when </v>
<v Speaker 4>it came out and then it becomes lame and</v>

1365
01:01:39.081 --> 01:01:42.680
<v Speaker 4>now at the comedy again because really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because now you watch it and you go,</v>

1366
01:01:42.681 --> 01:01:45.150
<v Speaker 4>what in the fuck are they talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1367
01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:50.260
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like some sort of a weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>sketchy on some television show.</v>

1368
01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:52.760
<v Speaker 4>Similarly it's to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a different thing.</v>

1369
01:01:52.761 --> 01:01:55.220
<v Speaker 4>So my wife was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife's a writer also and uh,</v>

1370
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:56.083
<v Speaker 4>she was working on a project that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>end up going when everybody was a TV </v>

1371
01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:00.860
<v Speaker 4>series based around the women in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Manson family.</v>

1372
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:04.670
<v Speaker 4>So I ended up reading everything I could</v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly,</v>

1373
01:02:04.671 --> 01:02:05.504
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to help her out,</v>

1374
01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:06.403
<v Speaker 4>learn about the mansons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the most interesting thing is how </v>

1375
01:02:10.071 --> 01:02:12.140
<v Speaker 4>they talk to each other about emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1376
01:02:12.141 --> 01:02:12.974
<v Speaker 4>Like whatever else you want to say about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the map Manson at that point they </v>

1377
01:02:15.471 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 4>thought they were doing the deepest shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>out there in terms of before things</v>

1378
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:20.933
<v Speaker 3>got crazy right when it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it was just like a psychological </v>

1379
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:25.540
<v Speaker 3>calls before it got totally nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you listen to how they.</v>

1380
01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:27.810
<v Speaker 3>They talk about psychedelic things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our emotions,</v>

1381
01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.350
<v Speaker 3>and it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had one of the problems.</v>

1382
01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.410
<v Speaker 3>You ran into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>

1383
01:02:31.411 --> 01:02:34.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to do here because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't use their dialogue.</v>

1384
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:37.200
<v Speaker 3>They sound like absolute morons all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1385
01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.110
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing like his pages of look </v>
<v Speaker 3>into my.</v>

1386
01:02:40.111 --> 01:02:40.944
<v Speaker 3>I know you look into my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you look into my eyes and be </v>

1387
01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.000
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy crap.</v>

1388
01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:47.040
<v Speaker 3>This really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that dumb.</v>

1389
01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:50.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always interested in and I've looked</v>

1390
01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:52.530
<v Speaker 3>at it and I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't really,</v>

1391
01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:55.920
<v Speaker 3>but I'm interested in how the language </v>
<v Speaker 3>has changed.</v>

1392
01:02:55.921 --> 01:02:56.940
<v Speaker 3>I always thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1393
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.640
<v Speaker 3>in the sixties we had no language for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of,</v>

1394
01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:02.610
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these ideas by the seventies </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the me generation,</v>

1395
01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:03.683
<v Speaker 3>we started to put a little more language</v>
<v Speaker 3>around psychological states and what </v>

1396
01:03:07.081 --> 01:03:07.914
<v Speaker 3>that it was by the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it got a little farmer and around the </v>

1397
01:03:10.381 --> 01:03:11.214
<v Speaker 3>nineties is when it cut a normalized and</v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly like guys could talk about </v>

1398
01:03:14.341 --> 01:03:15.810
<v Speaker 3>having emotions for the first time.</v>

1399
01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:17.820
<v Speaker 3>People don't talk about this back in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties,</v>

1400
01:03:17.821 --> 01:03:18.654
<v Speaker 3>but like the most rebellious thing a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>could do in the early eighties was have </v>

1401
01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:24.600
<v Speaker 3>feelings which nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you'd be like,</v>

1402
01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:27.480
<v Speaker 3>what really are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

1403
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:28.343
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was really interesting </v>

1404
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:30.083
<v Speaker 3>and you can see it in the language and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how we talk about things like emotions </v>

1405
01:03:32.221 --> 01:03:34.200
<v Speaker 3>and psychological problems evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1406
01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:38.190
<v Speaker 1>He didn't cry in the sixties right after</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1407
01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not definitely.</v>

1408
01:03:39.731 --> 01:03:40.564
<v Speaker 1>Not In the fifties.</v>

1409
01:03:41.170 --> 01:03:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Definitely not in the fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was the strong silent.</v>

1410
01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:43.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1411
01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.490
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's a stereotype so it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>

1412
01:03:45.491 --> 01:03:47.770
<v Speaker 3>but it was the strong silent type.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that's what people wanted.</v>

1413
01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:48.260
<v Speaker 3>They wanted that</v>

1414
01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:51.350
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne guy or counselor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1415
01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1416
01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:54.080
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1417
01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:54.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe that's just a sign of the </v>

1418
01:03:55.611 --> 01:03:56.444
<v Speaker 1>times because the world was hard and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're coming off of the depression and </v>

1419
01:03:59.781 --> 01:04:00.614
<v Speaker 1>from the depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you grow up and you're living in the 19 </v>

1420
01:04:02.181 --> 01:04:03.014
<v Speaker 1>fifties now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does those are the adults that grew up </v>

1421
01:04:05.661 --> 01:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>during that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1422
01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:10.760
<v Speaker 1>you're in your late thirties or early </v>
<v Speaker 1>forties and your,</v>

1423
01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:13.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with the ramifications of</v>

1424
01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:14.443
<v Speaker 1>all the shit that you had to go through </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what society was going through when </v>

1425
01:04:17.031 --> 01:04:19.250
<v Speaker 1>you were a kid and it was hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard times.</v>

1426
01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.810
<v Speaker 1>W no room for pussies.</v>

1427
01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.930
<v Speaker 3>You asked my grandmother what life was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like in Russia before she died.</v>

1428
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.823
<v Speaker 3>She only had it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would never tell us which had one </v>

1429
01:04:25.971 --> 01:04:27.590
<v Speaker 3>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was we ate potatoes.</v>

1430
01:04:27.970 --> 01:04:28.840
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was,</v>

1431
01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:29.840
<v Speaker 3>what was Russia like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grandma,</v>

1432
01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.990
<v Speaker 3>we ate potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was Russia.</v>

1433
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.230
<v Speaker 3>Difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We ate potatoes.</v>

1434
01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Grandmother,</v>

1435
01:04:35.431 --> 01:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>when she died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had money stashed all around the house.</v>

1436
01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:39.203
<v Speaker 1>She'd take money and put it in coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>cans and Tuck it under a floorboard or </v>

1437
01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.120
<v Speaker 1>stick it behind book somewhere like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>

1438
01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:48.170
<v Speaker 1>She had stashed things everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was always worried that it was going</v>

1439
01:04:48.171 --> 01:04:51.120
<v Speaker 1>to fall apart again because she had </v>
<v Speaker 1>grown as a depression baby.</v>

1440
01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.513
<v Speaker 1>She had grown up in the heat of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just people not knowing if there </v>

1441
01:04:56.191 --> 01:04:58.650
<v Speaker 1>was going to be any food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And wondering,</v>

1442
01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they were ever going to get a job,</v>

1443
01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.310
<v Speaker 1>if they're ever going to get out of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole,</v>

1444
01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:05.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're soft as fuck right now.</v>

1445
01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:06.534
<v Speaker 1>So we concern ourselves with the 78 </v>
<v Speaker 1>different gender pronouns that they've </v>

1446
01:05:09.271 --> 01:05:11.680
<v Speaker 1>decided exist and all the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

1447
01:05:11.681 --> 01:05:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Is that a real number?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We make a.</v>

1448
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:13.800
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real now.</v>

1449
01:05:13.801 --> 01:05:16.200
<v Speaker 1>It's apparently it's deep into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>

1450
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 1>And you're supposed to recognize them.</v>

1451
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1452
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:19.983
<v Speaker 4>not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Jordan Peterson coming on in a </v>

1453
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:22.503
<v Speaker 4>couple of weeks and talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a professor at the University of </v>

1454
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:29.440
<v Speaker 4>Toronto and I'm in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada has different laws and they don't</v>

1455
01:05:29.441 --> 01:05:31.210
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have censorship,</v>

1456
01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.073
<v Speaker 4>they have legitimate censorship and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a human rights council and the </v>

1457
01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:36.124
<v Speaker 4>human rights council can determine </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not you are insensitive to </v>

1458
01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:41.650
<v Speaker 4>someone else's belief systems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you are,</v>

1459
01:05:41.651 --> 01:05:45.130
<v Speaker 4>you can be charged so you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can go to jail,</v>

1460
01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:45.964
<v Speaker 4>you can be brought in front of a court.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could be fined if you don't use the </v>

1461
01:05:49.751 --> 01:05:52.480
<v Speaker 4>correct gender pronouns that they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>decided.</v>

1462
01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean right now it's just theoretical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It hasn't been,</v>

1463
01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.250
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's at straight out of orwell.</v>

1464
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:58.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also in New York City.</v>

1465
01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:00.183
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but New York City now has new laws were </v>

1466
01:06:02.381 --> 01:06:03.214
<v Speaker 4>31 different gender pronouns are </v>
<v Speaker 4>recognized and if you are either an </v>

1467
01:06:06.581 --> 01:06:07.414
<v Speaker 4>employer or if you are a landlord and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you choose to miss gender someone and </v>

1468
01:06:12.941 --> 01:06:16.390
<v Speaker 4>not use the appropriate gender pronoun </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they prefer,</v>

1469
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:19.450
<v Speaker 4>you can be fined $250,000.</v>

1470
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:21.603
<v Speaker 4>That has not happened yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that is a real law that has been </v>

1471
01:06:24.431 --> 01:06:27.880
<v Speaker 4>passed to try to stop transgender </v>
<v Speaker 4>discrimination.</v>

1472
01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:31.090
<v Speaker 4>But how would you know in advance which </v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to ask?</v>

1473
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:33.220
<v Speaker 4>What pronouns do you prefer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see,</v>

1474
01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:36.100
<v Speaker 4>so everybody gets to be special without </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing anything special.</v>

1475
01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:37.323
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's easy to get food and </v>

1476
01:06:39.191 --> 01:06:40.024
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing does nothing dangerous on the </v>

1477
01:06:41.951 --> 01:06:42.784
<v Speaker 4>horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we look for problems and these are </v>

1478
01:06:45.641 --> 01:06:46.474
<v Speaker 4>one of the problems that people look for</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what's really fascinating is that </v>

1479
01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:49.503
<v Speaker 4>it's not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not transgender people that really </v>

1480
01:06:51.821 --> 01:06:52.654
<v Speaker 4>want this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Weirdos because transgender people </v>

1481
01:06:55.331 --> 01:06:57.400
<v Speaker 4>want to be either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's a man,</v>

1482
01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:59.590
<v Speaker 4>they want to be a woman and they'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>prefer to be,</v>

1483
01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:03.310
<v Speaker 4>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>prefer to be called a she or her and use</v>

1484
01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:06.060
<v Speaker 4>the female gender pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for females to male,</v>

1485
01:07:06.061 --> 01:07:06.894
<v Speaker 4>it's the opposite.</v>

1486
01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:08.043
<v Speaker 4>It's these people that want to be a z or</v>
<v Speaker 4>a here or a bunch of different fucking </v>

1487
01:07:12.221 --> 01:07:13.960
<v Speaker 4>weird ones that they've invented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just,</v>

1488
01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:16.180
<v Speaker 4>they're playing a game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

1489
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:17.710
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're in Narnia.</v>

1490
01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:18.611
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1491
01:07:18.611 --> 01:07:20.170
<v Speaker 4>they're playing dress up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1492
01:07:20.171 --> 01:07:21.520
<v Speaker 4>it's just weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bizarre thing.</v>

1493
01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:22.383
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm now I'm making up names for what I </v>

1494
01:07:23.921 --> 01:07:25.090
<v Speaker 4>am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Fox.</v>

1495
01:07:25.091 --> 01:07:26.690
<v Speaker 4>Can you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1496
01:07:26.691 --> 01:07:27.301
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

1497
01:07:27.301 --> 01:07:28.260
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1498
01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:29.580
<v Speaker 4>you look a little like a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

1499
01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:30.423
<v Speaker 4>Just thinking that when I came in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is exactly the same kind of </v>

1500
01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:33.364
<v Speaker 4>thinking that's behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like this is not an </v>

1501
01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.720
<v Speaker 4>antidiscrimination problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

1502
01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:40.460
<v Speaker 4>it's a self indulgence problem more than</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

1503
01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.550
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1504
01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.150
<v Speaker 4>what passes for creative self </v>
<v Speaker 4>expression,</v>

1505
01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:47.440
<v Speaker 4>like gut and do something in the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>and go do something.</v>

1506
01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you do when they have time to be</v>

1507
01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:51.670
<v Speaker 4>coming up with 78 different gender </v>
<v Speaker 4>pronouns?</v>

1508
01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.970
<v Speaker 4>Fuck doing right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's examine what's going on here.</v>

1509
01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:58.930
<v Speaker 4>Tinder updates including 37 new gender </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity options,</v>

1510
01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:01.930
<v Speaker 4>37 new ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new ones,</v>

1511
01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:03.423
<v Speaker 4>37 new ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to look back at this time </v>

1512
01:08:06.581 --> 01:08:07.414
<v Speaker 4>and we're going to fucking laugh the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't laugh at old comedies were </v>

1513
01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:11.973
<v Speaker 4>going to laugh at the actual historical </v>
<v Speaker 4>documents that show how fucking </v>

1514
01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:17.174
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous people in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where we're going to look at people 50 </v>

1515
01:08:19.971 --> 01:08:20.610
<v Speaker 4>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna.</v>

1516
01:08:20.610 --> 01:08:21.443
<v Speaker 4>Look back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what in the fuck were they doing before </v>

1517
01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:24.050
<v Speaker 4>the asteroid hit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1518
01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:28.040
<v Speaker 4>They were going crazy that it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>like Rome before the fall,</v>

1519
01:08:28.041 --> 01:08:28.874
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all just going crazy and just </v>

1520
01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:36.670
<v Speaker 4>completely obsessed with nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that that also speaks to the</v>

1521
01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:38.864
<v Speaker 4>desire or the the requirement that human</v>
<v Speaker 4>beings have for a certain amount of </v>

1522
01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:48.520
<v Speaker 4>engagement in their environment and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain amount of drama and conflict.</v>

1523
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:54.050
<v Speaker 4>I think we're wired for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're wired for a certain amount</v>

1524
01:08:54.051 --> 01:08:54.884
<v Speaker 4>of conflict and resolution and problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>solving and I think that's one of the </v>

1525
01:08:57.831 --> 01:09:00.800
<v Speaker 4>reasons why people really like doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that are difficult.</v>

1526
01:09:00.801 --> 01:09:01.634
<v Speaker 4>I've been writing about this lately </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I've become obsessed with yoga </v>

1527
01:09:04.101 --> 01:09:07.820
<v Speaker 4>over the last couple of years and I suck</v>
<v Speaker 4>at it.</v>

1528
01:09:08.190 --> 01:09:12.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm not very good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as I do it and continue to do it and</v>

1529
01:09:12.291 --> 01:09:13.124
<v Speaker 4>get better at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's making everything else </v>

1530
01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:17.010
<v Speaker 4>in my life better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's any way that girl.</v>

1531
01:09:17.011 --> 01:09:18.770
<v Speaker 4>There's an athlete without yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't.</v>

1532
01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.070
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just break too many things.</v>

1533
01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:21.923
<v Speaker 4>I think you're totally right and I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has a negative connotation because </v>

1534
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:30.140
<v Speaker 4>people think of it as like being soccer </v>
<v Speaker 4>moms and it's fucking hard.</v>

1535
01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:31.003
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first time.</v>

1536
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:34.100
<v Speaker 4>So I put about 65 hairline fractures and</v>
<v Speaker 4>my legs.</v>

1537
01:09:34.101 --> 01:09:38.630
<v Speaker 4>I shattered my legs and I'm 65 hairline </v>
<v Speaker 4>all in one.</v>

1538
01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:40.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Longer story.</v>

1539
01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was a 16,</v>

1540
01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:45.600
<v Speaker 2>skied off a cliff in Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>split my.</v>

1541
01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.473
<v Speaker 2>Didn't see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nose there and split my Patellas so </v>

1542
01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:52.930
<v Speaker 2>my knees never folded right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I started,</v>

1543
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:53.783
<v Speaker 2>but when you say split my Patella,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I cracked my kneecaps and back </v>

1544
01:09:57.611 --> 01:10:00.760
<v Speaker 2>then they couldn't do anything for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't.</v>

1545
01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:05.890
<v Speaker 2>So they just let it heal and my legs </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't fold quite right.</v>

1546
01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.530
<v Speaker 2>So the angle was off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1547
01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:09.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I came up I started out as a </v>

1548
01:10:10.781 --> 01:10:11.614
<v Speaker 2>journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the action and adventure sports </v>

1549
01:10:12.821 --> 01:10:13.654
<v Speaker 2>were starting out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the early nineties and you could </v>

1550
01:10:15.251 --> 01:10:19.810
<v Speaker 2>ski and ride or surfing right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or rock climbing or there was work and I</v>

1551
01:10:19.811 --> 01:10:21.550
<v Speaker 2>couldn't do any of those things very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>

1552
01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:22.384
<v Speaker 2>But I lied to my editors because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted the work and I was really </v>

1553
01:10:24.101 --> 01:10:24.820
<v Speaker 2>fascinated with.</v>

1554
01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:25.653
<v Speaker 2>So I spent about five or six years </v>
<v Speaker 2>chasing athletes around mountains and I </v>

1555
01:10:27.881 --> 01:10:28.714
<v Speaker 2>broke a lot of bones along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened was every time I impacted </v>

1556
01:10:33.761 --> 01:10:34.594
<v Speaker 2>right ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if skiing bumps dropped off a little </v>

1557
01:10:36.281 --> 01:10:37.114
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would put microfracture in my legs a </v>

1558
01:10:39.461 --> 01:10:41.470
<v Speaker 2>little one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as of your nice structures,</v>

1559
01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:44.110
<v Speaker 2>they weren't told it wasn't folding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1560
01:10:44.111 --> 01:10:46.810
<v Speaker 2>So the shock absorbers was working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

1561
01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:48.340
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1562
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:49.263
<v Speaker 2>one day they all turned into bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>fractures and I sort of collapsed and </v>

1563
01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:54.393
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I was at the Cleveland </v>

1564
01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Clinic and the doc walked out holding up</v>
<v Speaker 2>my extra and he was like,</v>

1565
01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:01.030
<v Speaker 2>the cube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1566
01:11:01.031 --> 01:11:02.830
<v Speaker 2>how do you even walk in here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

1567
01:11:02.831 --> 01:11:04.270
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

1568
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:05.540
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>

1569
01:11:05.541 --> 01:11:07.570
<v Speaker 2>you're days of skiing or running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1570
01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.160
<v Speaker 2>that's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1571
01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:10.750
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's over,</v>

1572
01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:11.890
<v Speaker 2>you're out of your mind.</v>

1573
01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.700
<v Speaker 2>It was like 20 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1574
01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:16.500
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever,</v>

1575
01:11:16.501 --> 01:11:17.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember what tricked me </v>
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

1576
01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:20.560
<v Speaker 2>I started doing the yoga and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1577
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:21.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

1578
01:11:21.631 --> 01:11:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I needed more flexibility.</v>

1579
01:11:23.731 --> 01:11:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that was the key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1580
01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:28.640
<v Speaker 2>but I remember the first time I went </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the yoga class and you know,</v>

1581
01:11:28.641 --> 01:11:29.474
<v Speaker 2>you sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look to your right and there's a 75 </v>

1582
01:11:31.891 --> 01:11:35.450
<v Speaker 2>year old woman who's doing stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I can't even begin to do.</v>

1583
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:36.450
<v Speaker 2>And I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hurt so much.</v>

1584
01:11:36.451 --> 01:11:37.284
<v Speaker 2>I've got tears rolling down my feet to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to like get in that position and I </v>

1585
01:11:39.901 --> 01:11:40.800
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

1586
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:44.790
<v Speaker 2>There's no way I'm going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinated by that and I just stuck with</v>

1587
01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:46.740
<v Speaker 2>it because I know I'm competitive and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

1588
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:48.450
<v Speaker 2>she can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do it.</v>

1589
01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one old woman.</v>

1590
01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.050
<v Speaker 1>I hate calling her old woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a nice lady.</v>

1591
01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:54.373
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to use any pejorative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's a probably deep into her </v>

1592
01:11:57.611 --> 01:12:00.640
<v Speaker 1>sixties I would imagine she's there </v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I'm there.</v>

1593
01:12:00.641 --> 01:12:01.474
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how often she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's there almost every time I'm </v>

1594
01:12:03.671 --> 01:12:04.504
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That lady busts her ass every class and </v>

1595
01:12:09.281 --> 01:12:12.910
<v Speaker 1>she walks out of there smiling and happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

1596
01:12:12.911 --> 01:12:13.744
<v Speaker 1>how many people that are in her age </v>
<v Speaker 1>group have that kind of energy and that </v>

1597
01:12:17.231 --> 01:12:20.830
<v Speaker 1>kind of vitality to get through a 90 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute hot yoga class.</v>

1598
01:12:20.831 --> 01:12:23.230
<v Speaker 1>It'd be smiling and chipper when it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all over.</v>

1599
01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:25.300
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

1600
01:12:25.450 --> 01:12:27.780
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my point was that the.</v>

1601
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I really think that doing difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1602
01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:31.131
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

1603
01:12:31.131 --> 01:12:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you also,</v>

1604
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:33.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about earlier like flow </v>

1605
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:39.920
<v Speaker 2>shows up when our skills are stretched </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Max and we know,</v>

1606
01:12:39.921 --> 01:12:41.790
<v Speaker 2>and this is go back to chicks at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

1607
01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:44.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's massive data on this at this</v>

1608
01:12:44.421 --> 01:12:46.670
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people who are happiest,</v>

1609
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.863
<v Speaker 2>the people who have score off the charts</v>
<v Speaker 2>for overall life satisfaction and </v>

1610
01:12:50.391 --> 01:12:52.850
<v Speaker 2>wellbeing or the people with the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>flow in their lives.</v>

1611
01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.073
<v Speaker 2>So people the most flown their lives are</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are constantly challenging </v>

1612
01:12:57.171 --> 01:12:59.900
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are constantly pushing all the time.</v>

1613
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.530
<v Speaker 1>That totally makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1614
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:07.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm absolutely at my most happy when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in difficult activities.</v>

1615
01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1616
01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:09.903
<v Speaker 1>And in you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also like shitty results sometimes </v>

1617
01:13:12.601 --> 01:13:13.434
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't feel good and then you just </v>

1618
01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:15.924
<v Speaker 1>rebuild and figure out what went wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then bounce back from those shitty </v>

1619
01:13:18.631 --> 01:13:21.450
<v Speaker 1>results and then achieve something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had achieved before.</v>

1620
01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:24.630
<v Speaker 1>And then you get this giant boost of </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness and satisfaction.</v>

1621
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.033
<v Speaker 1>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel energized and engaged as long as </v>

1622
01:13:28.561 --> 01:13:29.394
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing difficult things all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's archery or martial arts or </v>

1623
01:13:33.211 --> 01:13:36.580
<v Speaker 1>yoga or something difficult things for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason when I'm doing them,</v>

1624
01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:39.690
<v Speaker 1>my brain is in a good state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1625
01:13:39.691 --> 01:13:42.990
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the reasons why I've been so</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinated with your work and these,</v>

1626
01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:43.853
<v Speaker 1>these concepts of flow is because I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a whole bunch of different </v>

1627
01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:53.511
<v Speaker 1>variables that or different states that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you achieve in the mind.</v>

1628
01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:54.773
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a momentum state that I feel </v>

1629
01:13:56.221 --> 01:13:57.054
<v Speaker 1>like I get when I'm doing all the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to do when I'm writing a </v>

1630
01:14:00.451 --> 01:14:01.284
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm exercising a lot and I'm eating </v>

1631
01:14:01.981 --> 01:14:02.814
<v Speaker 1>healthy a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this momentum state and that </v>

1632
01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:08.040
<v Speaker 1>momentum state is a different state than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flow state.</v>

1633
01:14:08.041 --> 01:14:09.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1634
01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:10.560
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1635
01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:15.560
<v Speaker 1>it success or it propagates the concept </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a continuing to improve [inaudible] I</v>

1636
01:14:18.311 --> 01:14:19.310
<v Speaker 1>know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

1637
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:22.550
<v Speaker 1>I tend to notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it the momentum stage.</v>

1638
01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.630
<v Speaker 1>When I'm getting into flow fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently,</v>

1639
01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:28.790
<v Speaker 1>that tends to show up at other times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1640
01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:29.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1641
01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:35.640
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think like when that feeling is</v>

1642
01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:38.410
<v Speaker 1>really present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you make big bets.</v>

1643
01:14:38.411 --> 01:14:40.570
<v Speaker 1>That's when you really go because you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>

1644
01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wind in your sails driving you.</v>

1645
01:14:43.151 --> 01:14:43.984
<v Speaker 1>If I'm not feeling that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I will always be willing to take </v>

1646
01:14:46.931 --> 01:14:49.120
<v Speaker 1>a big risk and challenge myself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1647
01:14:49.121 --> 01:14:49.954
<v Speaker 1>but I'm much more comfortable doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm feeling that momentum because </v>

1648
01:14:52.151 --> 01:14:52.810
<v Speaker 1>then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1649
01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:55.150
<v Speaker 1>I know I've at least I got a shot at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1650
01:14:55.150 --> 01:14:57.300
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that exists with a.</v>

1651
01:14:57.310 --> 01:14:59.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a big one with martial artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big one with fighters.</v>

1652
01:14:59.951 --> 01:15:02.830
<v Speaker 1>You see that with fighters when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a bad result,</v>

1653
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.113
<v Speaker 1>they have this rebuilding period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're oftentimes they are on shaky legs </v>

1654
01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:09.820
<v Speaker 1>and then sometimes they never come back </v>
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>

1655
01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:10.953
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes one bad result for a fighter </v>

1656
01:15:12.821 --> 01:15:15.730
<v Speaker 1>in their careers essentially over there </v>
<v Speaker 1>ghost of themselves.</v>

1657
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:16.863
<v Speaker 1>But up until that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's fighters have these dates that </v>

1658
01:15:19.301 --> 01:15:22.900
<v Speaker 1>they achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A perfect example is Anderson Silva,</v>

1659
01:15:22.901 --> 01:15:25.750
<v Speaker 1>when he was in his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva was widely recognized,</v>

1660
01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.593
<v Speaker 1>is if not number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly in the top two or three best </v>

1661
01:15:29.651 --> 01:15:33.430
<v Speaker 1>fighters of all time and UFC considers </v>
<v Speaker 1>them the best of all time,</v>

1662
01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:34.503
<v Speaker 1>but he had achieved this state of mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>and of performance when he was at the </v>

1663
01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:40.533
<v Speaker 1>end of his reign is the middleweight </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion when he was almost in the </v>

1664
01:15:42.101 --> 01:15:42.934
<v Speaker 1>matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he would fight guys and stand </v>

1665
01:15:44.681 --> 01:15:45.310
<v Speaker 1>right in front of them.</v>

1666
01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:46.143
<v Speaker 1>They would throw punches and he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>just slide out of the way effortlessly </v>

1667
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:49.623
<v Speaker 1>and then knocked him out and drop them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this famous fight that he had </v>

1668
01:15:52.001 --> 01:15:53.570
<v Speaker 1>with forrest griffin for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1669
01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:54.763
<v Speaker 1>well it was one of his first fights at </v>
<v Speaker 1>light heavyweight when he was the </v>

1670
01:15:57.041 --> 01:15:57.874
<v Speaker 1>middleweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's fighting 20 pounds above his </v>

1671
01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:00.870
<v Speaker 1>weight class against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1672
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:02.170
<v Speaker 1>a really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch this,</v>

1673
01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.510
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a look at this.</v>

1674
01:16:05.650 --> 01:16:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Watch how he's standing right in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

1675
01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.780
<v Speaker 1>And it just moves out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time for us tries to punch him.</v>

1676
01:16:10.781 --> 01:16:13.600
<v Speaker 1>He's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then watch this being.</v>

1677
01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.240
<v Speaker 1>It just cracks him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1678
01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.230
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's watching it live.</v>

1679
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.720
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is a fucking wizard.</v>

1680
01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really strange.</v>

1681
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:23.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was standing in front of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1682
01:16:24.010 --> 01:16:24.843
<v Speaker 1>like he saw everything coming in slow </v>
<v Speaker 1>motion and forrest is a world class </v>

1683
01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:30.214
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>

1684
01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.113
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a bunch of videos of </v>

1685
01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Anderson like that being in the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stood with his back.</v>

1686
01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:36.124
<v Speaker 1>He fought this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephan Bonner stood with his back </v>

1687
01:16:37.871 --> 01:16:39.070
<v Speaker 1>against the cages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stood there,</v>

1688
01:16:39.071 --> 01:16:42.660
<v Speaker 1>dropped his hands and invited the guy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>just throw punches and kicks Adam.</v>

1689
01:16:42.850 --> 01:16:43.683
<v Speaker 1>And then when the guy tried to attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just slip right out of the way and </v>

1690
01:16:46.241 --> 01:16:47.710
<v Speaker 1>then he went right back to the spot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1691
01:16:47.711 --> 01:16:48.550
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do it again.</v>

1692
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:50.500
<v Speaker 1>And the guy who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

1693
01:16:50.501 --> 01:16:52.330
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is happening to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>

1694
01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Because he was being humiliated is </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing as hell.</v>

1695
01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:57.273
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen seconds later he smashes him </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Anita stomach and knocks him </v>

1696
01:17:00.221 --> 01:17:02.530
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean it was just,</v>

1697
01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:05.590
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had achieved this weird state because</v>

1698
01:17:05.591 --> 01:17:08.470
<v Speaker 1>of the momentum of his success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his confidence.</v>

1699
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:09.913
<v Speaker 1>And you also had this weird aura about </v>
<v Speaker 1>him when he was at the top where </v>

1700
01:17:12.351 --> 01:17:13.184
<v Speaker 1>everyone was terrified of him because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>could do things like that and you had a </v>

1701
01:17:16.161 --> 01:17:16.994
<v Speaker 1>feeling that maybe he's going to put his</v>
<v Speaker 1>back up against the cage with you and </v>

1702
01:17:19.191 --> 01:17:19.970
<v Speaker 1>humiliate you.</v>

1703
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:22.940
<v Speaker 1>So you were almost training in vain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like training,</v>

1704
01:17:22.941 --> 01:17:25.630
<v Speaker 1>thinking that like one day I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get in there with this guy and I'm going</v>

1705
01:17:25.631 --> 01:17:27.170
<v Speaker 1>to get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody else.</v>

1706
01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:28.011
<v Speaker 1>Be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1707
01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:29.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1708
01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:33.170
<v Speaker 1>well he was like water for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that got him,</v>

1709
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.510
<v Speaker 1>well father time got him for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he had.</v>

1710
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:37.640
<v Speaker 1>He got knocked out by this Guy Chris </v>
<v Speaker 1>Weidman.</v>

1711
01:17:37.641 --> 01:17:38.474
<v Speaker 1>He got knocked out doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got knocked out like joking around </v>

1712
01:17:41.421 --> 01:17:46.010
<v Speaker 1>and putting his hands down and Weidman </v>
<v Speaker 1>just judged where he was going to be and</v>

1713
01:17:46.011 --> 01:17:47.960
<v Speaker 1>faked him out and caught him with a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>punch.</v>

1714
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Knocked unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's never been the same again now.</v>

1715
01:17:50.331 --> 01:17:51.290
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1716
01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:53.300
<v Speaker 1>just all stopped right there.</v>

1717
01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:55.340
<v Speaker 3>I did not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have noticed,</v>

1718
01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:57.253
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's one of the more </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting things about kind of </v>

1719
01:17:58.700 --> 01:17:59.533
<v Speaker 3>breaking bones as an athlete is it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter consciously how brave I </v>

1720
01:18:04.641 --> 01:18:07.850
<v Speaker 3>want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a couple years ago I did this and I</v>

1721
01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:10.340
<v Speaker 3>basically nearly severed my hand from </v>
<v Speaker 3>my.</v>

1722
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:11.263
<v Speaker 3>What's going on in there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at 25 foot cliff that I swear I </v>

1723
01:18:14.250 --> 01:18:15.083
<v Speaker 3>ordered a 35 foot cliff at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I under jumped it and I basically went </v>

1724
01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.910
<v Speaker 3>wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I flipped upside down,</v>

1725
01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.300
<v Speaker 3>rates went down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1726
01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:27.580
<v Speaker 3>but for a year and a half after it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever I was above exposed rock.</v>

1727
01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:33.770
<v Speaker 3>So which happens as a skier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a downhill mountain bike or all the top,</v>

1728
01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.633
<v Speaker 3>you're always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have an immediate fight or </v>

1729
01:18:36.321 --> 01:18:37.154
<v Speaker 3>flight response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would freeze and just start shaking </v>

1730
01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:41.120
<v Speaker 3>and I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing.</v>

1731
01:18:41.121 --> 01:18:41.954
<v Speaker 3>I mean that I just had to kind of expose</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself to it over and it took about a </v>

1732
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:47.143
<v Speaker 3>year to like calm down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've discovered that after a big </v>

1733
01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.040
<v Speaker 3>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a broken bone,</v>

1734
01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:53.540
<v Speaker 3>torn rotator cuffs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1735
01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:55.093
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take me six to eight </v>
<v Speaker 3>months at to just like get my </v>

1736
01:18:58.730 --> 01:19:03.080
<v Speaker 3>unconscious back and ready to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>take risks again.</v>

1737
01:19:03.081 --> 01:19:04.370
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1738
01:19:04.371 --> 01:19:05.204
<v Speaker 3>I could be healed from the injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could be in better shape than I was </v>

1739
01:19:07.491 --> 01:19:08.840
<v Speaker 3>before the injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1740
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:10.123
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna take like six or eight months</v>
<v Speaker 3>from my subconscious to like get all </v>

1741
01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:16.370
<v Speaker 3>that fear out and actually reset towards</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal.</v>

1742
01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

1743
01:19:18.061 --> 01:19:20.120
<v Speaker 1>And when fighters lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1744
01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:22.770
<v Speaker 1>there's a physical aspect of it to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>injury.</v>

1745
01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:23.663
<v Speaker 1>Like if they get knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially they're worried about taking </v>

1746
01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:26.694
<v Speaker 1>a punch and sometimes that takes a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time before they can feel confident </v>

1747
01:19:30.001 --> 01:19:32.600
<v Speaker 1>enough to take a blow again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's also this,</v>

1748
01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:33.434
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an illusion of invulnerability </v>

1749
01:19:35.641 --> 01:19:37.710
<v Speaker 1>that they achieve when they're at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very best.</v>

1750
01:19:38.010 --> 01:19:40.110
<v Speaker 1>And that illusion is shattered when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized like,</v>

1751
01:19:40.111 --> 01:19:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now I'm the nail.</v>

1752
01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:44.010
<v Speaker 1>I used to be the hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but today I'm the nail.</v>

1753
01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.020
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you deal with being the nail?</v>

1754
01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.153
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think probably one of the biggest </v>

1755
01:19:49.111 --> 01:19:51.620
<v Speaker 1>psychological barriers that a fighter </v>
<v Speaker 1>can overcome.</v>

1756
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Their own mortality</v>

1757
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:56.520
<v Speaker 3>was your answer to that problem in what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which one?</v>

1758
01:19:56.521 --> 01:19:58.170
<v Speaker 3>How do you come back from becoming an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ale</v>

1759
01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:02.420
<v Speaker 1>ends on the person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends on where you are in your career.</v>

1760
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:03.583
<v Speaker 1>For some fighters they have to recognize</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because of the amount of damage </v>

1761
01:20:06.321 --> 01:20:08.030
<v Speaker 1>that they've taken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1762
01:20:08.031 --> 01:20:08.864
<v Speaker 1>you have what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way I always like to describe it is </v>

1763
01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:13.980
<v Speaker 1>like you have a ticket and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of holes you can punch on</v>

1764
01:20:13.981 --> 01:20:16.950
<v Speaker 1>that ticket and when you punch too many </v>
<v Speaker 1>holes on that ticket,</v>

1765
01:20:16.951 --> 01:20:18.930
<v Speaker 1>you don't get those back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1766
01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:19.883
<v Speaker 1>It's over and you have to really be </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of that because if you start </v>

1767
01:20:22.981 --> 01:20:23.814
<v Speaker 1>getting delusional or new started having</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ridiculous idea that you're </v>

1768
01:20:27.751 --> 01:20:28.584
<v Speaker 1>different than everybody else had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>there before you and even though you've </v>

1769
01:20:30.481 --> 01:20:31.314
<v Speaker 1>been getting knocked out regularly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>training because your Chin's gone that </v>

1770
01:20:34.771 --> 01:20:36.270
<v Speaker 1>somehow now they're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it together.</v>

1771
01:20:36.271 --> 01:20:39.150
<v Speaker 1>When the fight comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only take so many shots.</v>

1772
01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.313
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only take so much trauma </v>

1773
01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:44.520
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure in the body as well.</v>

1774
01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much work has been done</v>

1775
01:20:46.471 --> 01:20:47.304
<v Speaker 1>studying body trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can only imagine the amount of </v>

1776
01:20:49.861 --> 01:20:52.500
<v Speaker 1>scar tissue that you build up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I getting kicked in the liver,</v>

1777
01:20:52.770 --> 01:20:54.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>camp after camp,</v>

1778
01:20:54.151 --> 01:20:54.984
<v Speaker 1>fight after fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it cannot be good for your </v>

1779
01:20:56.911 --> 01:20:58.290
<v Speaker 1>kidneys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get abused,</v>

1780
01:20:58.630 --> 01:20:59.463
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your internal organs get smashed by </v>

1781
01:21:01.261 --> 01:21:05.550
<v Speaker 1>kicks and punches on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body only has so much resilience,</v>

1782
01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:06.683
<v Speaker 1>so if someone is there because someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a bad state because they're 22 years </v>

1783
01:21:11.281 --> 01:21:13.410
<v Speaker 1>old and they fought someone that got </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked out,</v>

1784
01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.273
<v Speaker 1>I would say they just need to take some </v>
<v Speaker 1>time off rest of the brain because </v>

1785
01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:18.624
<v Speaker 1>that's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing that a lot of fighters </v>

1786
01:21:20.131 --> 01:21:23.490
<v Speaker 1>fuck up on as they try to get right back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there and you're vulnerable.</v>

1787
01:21:23.490 --> 01:21:25.430
<v Speaker 1>You're much more vulnerable than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were before when you were.</v>

1788
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.273
<v Speaker 1>You've been knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you been knocked completely </v>

1789
01:21:27.811 --> 01:21:28.644
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and flatlined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is way easier for you to be knocked </v>

1790
01:21:30.721 --> 01:21:31.250
<v Speaker 1>out again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1791
01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:31.880
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1792
01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.540
<v Speaker 1>that's all the Tbi stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1793
01:21:33.541 --> 01:21:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Like that's why there's concussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>protocols.</v>

1794
01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got gotta wait super vulnerable </v>

1795
01:21:37.501 --> 01:21:41.610
<v Speaker 1>right afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember like it was a car accident,</v>

1796
01:21:41.611 --> 01:21:42.444
<v Speaker 1>concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember going rock climbing and </v>

1797
01:21:44.101 --> 01:21:46.380
<v Speaker 1>it was two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three weeks after and I was,</v>

1798
01:21:46.670 --> 01:21:47.503
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 feet up on the wall as vertigo or </v>

1799
01:21:50.431 --> 01:21:52.050
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of craziness.</v>

1800
01:21:52.051 --> 01:21:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Like legos started sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thing started like it was,</v>

1801
01:21:55.670 --> 01:21:58.650
<v Speaker 1>my brain just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ handle this at all.</v>

1802
01:21:58.651 --> 01:21:59.484
<v Speaker 1>It was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was lots of ropes and protection </v>

1803
01:22:00.311 --> 01:22:02.010
<v Speaker 1>and my friend just got me off the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

1804
01:22:02.011 --> 01:22:02.844
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember at the time and I was </v>

1805
01:22:04.621 --> 01:22:05.431
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1806
01:22:05.431 --> 01:22:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking for a hole that was looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a cold and a crack or something like</v>

1807
01:22:08.971 --> 01:22:10.240
<v Speaker 1>that were like three cracks.</v>

1808
01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.073
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

1809
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:13.740
<v Speaker 1>There were not three cracks here a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second ago.</v>

1810
01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:18.120
<v Speaker 1>What the hell just happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have brain trauma is no joke.</v>

1811
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:22.140
<v Speaker 1>So I think for fighters there would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the physical aspect of it and the mental</v>

1812
01:22:22.141 --> 01:22:22.974
<v Speaker 1>aspect of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of them are very difficult to </v>

1813
01:22:24.001 --> 01:22:25.710
<v Speaker 1>overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're younger,</v>

1814
01:22:25.711 --> 01:22:29.580
<v Speaker 1>the physical aspect is easier to resolve</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just need time.</v>

1815
01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:32.400
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychological aspect,</v>

1816
01:22:32.450 --> 01:22:33.283
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people get over it better than </v>

1817
01:22:34.021 --> 01:22:34.854
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people have a more honest </v>

1818
01:22:36.241 --> 01:22:38.870
<v Speaker 1>assessment of themselves as a human and </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

1819
01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:40.130
<v Speaker 1>as a competitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

1820
01:22:40.131 --> 01:22:43.440
<v Speaker 1>they understand that this is just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really difficult thing they're doing and</v>

1821
01:22:43.441 --> 01:22:45.480
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's going to work out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's not.</v>

1822
01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:49.590
<v Speaker 1>And other people to just think I am the </v>
<v Speaker 1>baddest motherfucker that's ever lived.</v>

1823
01:22:49.591 --> 01:22:51.180
<v Speaker 1>And then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something happens.</v>

1824
01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:51.781
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1825
01:22:51.781 --> 01:22:52.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm normal.</v>

1826
01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:55.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's really hard for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mindset thing,</v>

1827
01:22:55.171 --> 01:22:56.004
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference between a fixed and a </v>

1828
01:22:56.461 --> 01:22:57.900
<v Speaker 1>growth mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1829
01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.340
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also,</v>

1830
01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:00.373
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a difference between someone who's </v>

1831
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:02.783
<v Speaker 1>been lucky and understands that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been lucky and someone who's been lucky </v>

1832
01:23:07.391 --> 01:23:09.760
<v Speaker 1>and it feels like they've been blessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the gods.</v>

1833
01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:13.450
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden the gods have </v>
<v Speaker 1>rescinded their program and they say,</v>

1834
01:23:13.451 --> 01:23:14.520
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fickle that way.</v>

1835
01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:16.420
<v Speaker 1>You're just normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're mortal.</v>

1836
01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:18.910
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many variables.</v>

1837
01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:19.744
<v Speaker 1>And it's like how it happened to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it a lucky shot that you got hit </v>

1838
01:23:22.541 --> 01:23:24.430
<v Speaker 1>with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it a prolonged beating?</v>

1839
01:23:24.670 --> 01:23:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Which is oftentimes the worst when a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>really gets beat up,</v>

1840
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:29.223
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard for them to come back </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what you see inside the octagon </v>

1841
01:23:33.311 --> 01:23:36.040
<v Speaker 1>with when a person gets beaten up is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just the beginning of it.</v>

1842
01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:37.353
<v Speaker 1>What really happens after that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>ringing in the ears for weeks with </v>

1843
01:23:41.421 --> 01:23:42.254
<v Speaker 1>Vertigo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking horrible bruises all over your </v>

1844
01:23:45.101 --> 01:23:50.101
<v Speaker 1>face and your body and aching and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible pain for a long time.</v>

1845
01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.960
<v Speaker 1>When you see a guy get the fuck beat out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of him.</v>

1846
01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:54.760
<v Speaker 1>That's just the beginning of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle.</v>

1847
01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:57.070
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you see,</v>

1848
01:23:57.071 --> 01:24:00.370
<v Speaker 1>especially a really bad knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You our entire.</v>

1849
01:24:00.371 --> 01:24:03.100
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible you're seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone will never be the same again.</v>

1850
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:05.560
<v Speaker 1>That's heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1851
01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:08.590
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changes the way you watch fighting.</v>

1852
01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my good friend Dr.</v>

1853
01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Mark Gordon is a specialist in traumatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain injuries.</v>

1854
01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I know mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1855
01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Palladium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1856
01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's helped me when I had lyme disease.</v>

1857
01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he really did that?</v>

1858
01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:21.070
<v Speaker 1>That guy's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>

1859
01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.233
<v Speaker 1>But he's worked with so many football </v>
<v Speaker 1>players and soldiers and now he's </v>

1860
01:24:24.881 --> 01:24:26.470
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done some work with fighters too,</v>

1861
01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:29.620
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's adamant about it.</v>

1862
01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:32.650
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you start ringing that bell,</v>

1863
01:24:33.010 --> 01:24:33.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1864
01:24:33.731 --> 01:24:34.564
<v Speaker 1>you gotta do everything you can to heal </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing up and you cannot just jump </v>

1865
01:24:38.471 --> 01:24:39.304
<v Speaker 1>right back into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you see these football players </v>

1866
01:24:41.111 --> 01:24:41.944
<v Speaker 1>that are getting fucking cracked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then two periods later they're jumping </v>

1867
01:24:44.531 --> 01:24:45.910
<v Speaker 1>back in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1868
01:24:45.911 --> 01:24:48.550
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing a crazy thing.</v>

1869
01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:49.384
<v Speaker 1>You got flat lined and then you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>jumping back in the game three quarters </v>

1870
01:24:52.841 --> 01:24:54.550
<v Speaker 1>later or two quarters later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1871
01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's common.</v>

1872
01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:59.080
<v Speaker 1>It's common wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1873
01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:01.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to tell anybody anything when you're</v>

1874
01:25:01.631 --> 01:25:02.620
<v Speaker 1>22,</v>
<v Speaker 1>23,</v>

1875
01:25:02.621 --> 01:25:03.454
<v Speaker 1>24,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1876
01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:05.590
<v Speaker 1>at that age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at.</v>

1877
01:25:05.591 --> 01:25:06.424
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a professional athlete and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've trained yourself to be fiercely </v>

1878
01:25:09.191 --> 01:25:11.170
<v Speaker 1>competitive in that ferocious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else,</v>

1879
01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:12.543
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to dial that back was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a scary thing though because </v>

1880
01:25:15.221 --> 01:25:16.054
<v Speaker 1>compromising the ability to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly to me is one of the scariest </v>

1881
01:25:19.541 --> 01:25:20.590
<v Speaker 1>things that could happen to you.</v>

1882
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:23.650
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had lyme disease and one of the,</v>

1883
01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:26.190
<v Speaker 1>and I spent three years in bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the worst part about lyme disease,</v>

1884
01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:28.300
<v Speaker 1>I was really sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1885
01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.550
<v Speaker 1>That's where the research came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1886
01:25:30.630 --> 01:25:31.463
<v Speaker 1>I pulled myself out of it through </v>
<v Speaker 1>surfing and these crazy altered states </v>

1887
01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:38.170
<v Speaker 1>that was happening while I was surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my first question was,</v>

1888
01:25:38.171 --> 01:25:39.190
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is gold?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1889
01:25:39.191 --> 01:25:40.024
<v Speaker 1>Surfing is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've known carol for chronic autoimmune </v>

1890
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:43.540
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why was it having,</v>

1891
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:46.590
<v Speaker 1>having these crazy altered state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness experiences while surfing?</v>

1892
01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:48.040
<v Speaker 1>That's where it started for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1893
01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.560
<v Speaker 1>but with lyme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1894
01:25:51.630 --> 01:25:54.250
<v Speaker 1>you'd go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You become extremely paranoid.</v>

1895
01:25:54.251 --> 01:25:57.730
<v Speaker 1>The most common misdiagnosis for lyme is</v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoid schizophrenia.</v>

1896
01:25:58.140 --> 01:25:58.973
<v Speaker 1>So you become extremely paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was hallucinating short term memory </v>

1897
01:26:02.261 --> 01:26:03.750
<v Speaker 1>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm memory gone.</v>

1898
01:26:03.770 --> 01:26:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Been dyslexic.</v>

1899
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:06.590
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even read because I would get</v>

1900
01:26:06.591 --> 01:26:08.390
<v Speaker 2>to the end of a sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't remember the beginning of the</v>

1901
01:26:08.391 --> 01:26:11.660
<v Speaker 2>sentence that I read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like watching yourself go mad.</v>

1902
01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:12.793
<v Speaker 2>I don't know of any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have been through a lot of </v>

1903
01:26:14.511 --> 01:26:15.344
<v Speaker 2>physical pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been through a lot of different </v>

1904
01:26:16.041 --> 01:26:16.874
<v Speaker 2>illnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

1905
01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Nothing is worse than watching yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>go crazy.</v>

1906
01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrifying.</v>

1907
01:26:20.650 --> 01:26:21.800
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My good friend,</v>

1908
01:26:21.801 --> 01:26:22.634
<v Speaker 2>Tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his girlfriend just this past weekend </v>

1909
01:26:23.781 --> 01:26:26.870
<v Speaker 2>was telling me about she had lyme and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was misdiagnosed.</v>

1910
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.943
<v Speaker 2>She had to go to more than a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she said more than a dozen </v>

1911
01:26:30.591 --> 01:26:33.590
<v Speaker 2>different doctors before somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>finally listened to her.</v>

1912
01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:36.050
<v Speaker 2>If you find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if my second book west of Jesus,</v>

1913
01:26:36.051 --> 01:26:38.240
<v Speaker 2>which is the book I write about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is very early,</v>

1914
01:26:38.241 --> 01:26:43.241
<v Speaker 2>it's the first couple of pages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a list of all the diseases that I</v>

1915
01:26:44.181 --> 01:26:47.840
<v Speaker 2>was told I had before they actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered was lime and it's,</v>

1916
01:26:47.890 --> 01:26:49.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's half a page of diseases.</v>

1917
01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:50.813
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so confused by that because lyme is </v>

1918
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.820
<v Speaker 2>common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first of all I was,</v>

1919
01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:57.050
<v Speaker 2>I had it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1920
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:59.690
<v Speaker 2>I got it on the east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was here.</v>

1921
01:26:59.691 --> 01:27:02.660
<v Speaker 2>I was living in California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was living in La at the time were they</v>

1922
01:27:02.661 --> 01:27:04.340
<v Speaker 2>hadn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they've seen it,</v>

1923
01:27:04.341 --> 01:27:08.060
<v Speaker 2>but at that time nobody had really seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and they didn't believe it was a west</v>

1924
01:27:08.061 --> 01:27:09.360
<v Speaker 2>coast disease and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1925
01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:13.610
<v Speaker 2>it's still this point that diagnostics </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not fantastic for lyme.</v>

1926
01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:15.500
<v Speaker 2>But what I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend Katie,</v>

1927
01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:16.880
<v Speaker 2>my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tommy's girlfriend,</v>

1928
01:27:16.881 --> 01:27:17.714
<v Speaker 2>Katie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she lives in New Jersey or Connecticut </v>

1929
01:27:19.461 --> 01:27:21.410
<v Speaker 2>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's really common.</v>

1930
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:24.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>line Connecticut is where it came from,</v>

1931
01:27:24.321 --> 01:27:26.990
<v Speaker 2>so they live in a place where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really common and the doctor's like,</v>

1932
01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.210
<v Speaker 2>nap time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like a thing.</v>

1933
01:27:29.211 --> 01:27:30.770
<v Speaker 2>It might be lime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not lying.</v>

1934
01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:32.900
<v Speaker 2>You're going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went in,</v>

1935
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:35.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can talk about this.</v>

1936
01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:36.860
<v Speaker 2>I can't talk about this a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1937
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.903
<v Speaker 2>So we'll keep names out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first time I walked into see my </v>

1938
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:43.100
<v Speaker 2>doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1939
01:27:43.101 --> 01:27:43.934
<v Speaker 2>I've been sick for awhile and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>moved to La so it didn't have or a </v>

1940
01:27:46.011 --> 01:27:49.130
<v Speaker 2>regular practitioner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I finally got one and I've been sick for</v>

1941
01:27:49.131 --> 01:27:49.964
<v Speaker 2>a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of my friends had been trying </v>

1942
01:27:50.811 --> 01:27:52.430
<v Speaker 2>to figure out what the hell was going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1943
01:27:52.431 --> 01:27:54.230
<v Speaker 2>And one of my editors said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1944
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:55.303
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I think we have and go ask your </v>

1945
01:27:57.081 --> 01:27:59.540
<v Speaker 2>doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember walking into the doctor's</v>

1946
01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.580
<v Speaker 2>first time I'd seen him and I was like,</v>

1949
01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:04.970
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I have lyme.</v>

1950
01:28:04.971 --> 01:28:05.570

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

<v Speaker 2>are you sure?</v>

1957
01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Because my mother was one of the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>first AIDS activists in Ohio.</v>

1958
01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:23.180
<v Speaker 2>So like I've been having protected sex </v>

<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>

1963
01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:34.760
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing at that point.</v>

1964
01:28:34.761 --> 01:28:35.594
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to learn if you'll send me </v>

1965
01:28:36.471 --> 01:28:38.160

<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1966
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:42.300
<v Speaker 2>so this guy decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy just looks at me and the work.</v>

1967
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:43.370
<v Speaker 2>You're gay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1968
01:28:43.371 --> 01:28:45.110
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1969
01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:45.944
<v Speaker 2>buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like I haven't add homosexual </v>

1970
01:28:48.171 --> 01:28:49.490
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never used Ivy.</v>

1971
01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:56.300
<v Speaker 2>That was what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the worst thing is like I go home to</v>

1972
01:28:56.301 --> 01:28:58.160
<v Speaker 2>your girlfriend who you're living with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

1973
01:28:58.161 --> 01:29:00.370
<v Speaker 2>how was the doctor honey?</v>
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

1974
01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:02.063
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1975
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:05.220
<v Speaker 4>Did he test you before he tested?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He tested.</v>

1976
01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:06.900
<v Speaker 4>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that won the lawsuit.</v>

1977
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.961
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1978
01:29:07.961 --> 01:29:10.290
<v Speaker 4>By the time it was all said and I'm holy</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>

1979
01:29:10.291 --> 01:29:11.790
<v Speaker 4>you have to assume,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

1980
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.863
<v Speaker 4>It got really obnoxious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they wouldn't test me for </v>

1981
01:29:15.361 --> 01:29:16.194
<v Speaker 4>anything and it dragged on and on and on</v>
<v Speaker 4>that because they're worried that if </v>

1982
01:29:19.831 --> 01:29:20.664
<v Speaker 4>they do test you for something and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>confirmed that they were incorrect and </v>

1983
01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:26.730
<v Speaker 4>it sets them up for malpractice so </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to drag it out and it was</v>

1984
01:29:26.731 --> 01:29:27.460
<v Speaker 4>an Hmo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>

1985
01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:31.890
<v Speaker 4>So insurance has changed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but back in this was early $2,000</v>

1986
01:29:31.891 --> 01:29:33.190
<v Speaker 4>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ninety nine,</v>

1987
01:29:33.210 --> 01:29:34.043
<v Speaker 4>98.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I paid my premium was hmo coverage was </v>

1988
01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:38.664
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say at the time it was like a </v>

1989
01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:42.240
<v Speaker 4>couple of hundred bucks a month of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>200 bucks a month,</v>

1990
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:46.300
<v Speaker 4>$7 went to the doctor for testing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurant,</v>

1991
01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:50.010
<v Speaker 4>went to the insurance company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the doctor got $7 a month to treat me.</v>

1992
01:29:50.130 --> 01:29:53.640
<v Speaker 4>Somehow incentivized are that are run a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of big expensive tests.</v>

1993
01:29:53.670 --> 01:29:56.190
<v Speaker 4>So it looks at anybody on an Hmo is like</v>
<v Speaker 4>aids.</v>

1994
01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:58.290
<v Speaker 4>You got a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get aids,</v>

1995
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:00.833
<v Speaker 4>get them to run out of my office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully the goal just do drugs and </v>

1996
01:30:03.031 --> 01:30:05.460
<v Speaker 4>die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is drink himself to death.</v>

1997
01:30:05.490 --> 01:30:06.750
<v Speaker 4>It was ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

1998
01:30:06.751 --> 01:30:07.584
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this was a long time ago when line </v>

1999
01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:11.573
<v Speaker 4>wasn't nearly as prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now with lyme is a God damn scary </v>

2000
01:30:15.301 --> 01:30:16.134
<v Speaker 4>disease because I don't know when it </v>
<v Speaker 4>originated and they just started sorta </v>

2001
01:30:18.710 --> 01:30:21.450
<v Speaker 4>treating people for it over the last few</v>
<v Speaker 4>decades.</v>

2002
01:30:21.451 --> 01:30:22.320
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2003
01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:24.270
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if this is still true,</v>

2004
01:30:24.271 --> 01:30:25.104
<v Speaker 4>but there was a period of time where it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was the first or the second biggest </v>

2005
01:30:29.701 --> 01:30:32.880
<v Speaker 4>communicable disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your viral diseases in the world.</v>

2006
01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:34.200
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was second to AIDS.</v>

2007
01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:35.700
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I studied,</v>

2008
01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:39.270
<v Speaker 4>I did this show called the Joe Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 4>questions.</v>

2009
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:40.103
<v Speaker 4>Everything for Psi Phi and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that we looked into with </v>

2010
01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:43.473
<v Speaker 4>something called more jealous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know what more jealous or Jones </v>

2011
01:30:46.291 --> 01:30:47.124
<v Speaker 4>is a very controversial disease where </v>
<v Speaker 4>people feel like they have fibers </v>

2012
01:30:49.591 --> 01:30:53.320
<v Speaker 4>growing out of their skin and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>scratched themselves and develop these,</v>

2013
01:30:53.321 --> 01:30:54.154
<v Speaker 4>like open sores from itching and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they think that they'll get like carpet </v>

2014
01:30:58.741 --> 01:30:59.574
<v Speaker 4>fibers and their skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll think it's coming out of their </v>

2015
01:31:01.021 --> 01:31:01.854
<v Speaker 4>body like they have like fibers from </v>
<v Speaker 4>their clothes that they'll detect on </v>

2016
01:31:05.341 --> 01:31:06.174
<v Speaker 4>their skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it has this sort of weird </v>

2017
01:31:07.981 --> 01:31:08.814
<v Speaker 4>psychological aspect to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's interesting about it is a </v>

2018
01:31:11.191 --> 01:31:12.024
<v Speaker 4>disproportionate number of people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>have more gentleman's or believed they </v>

2019
01:31:15.210 --> 01:31:17.670
<v Speaker 4>haven't tested positive for lyme </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>

2020
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:20.790
<v Speaker 4>So I was talking to a doctor who had </v>
<v Speaker 4>more jealous,</v>

2021
01:31:20.791 --> 01:31:21.624
<v Speaker 4>who also has lyme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was very candid and honest about </v>

2022
01:31:24.361 --> 01:31:25.194
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He and he thinks that there's a direct </v>

2023
01:31:27.031 --> 01:31:28.740
<v Speaker 4>risk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something going on,</v>

2024
01:31:28.770 --> 01:31:29.603
<v Speaker 4>there's a neurotoxic effect that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening with the lyme disease that's </v>

2025
01:31:33.690 --> 01:31:35.310
<v Speaker 4>twisting his mind doesn't.</v>

2026
01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:37.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean I went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you I was at.</v>

2027
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:40.620
<v Speaker 4>That's why I wanted to talk to them </v>
<v Speaker 4>about Fairfax and sunset.</v>

2028
01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:42.480
<v Speaker 4>I was driving my car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just stick.</v>

2029
01:31:42.481 --> 01:31:44.100
<v Speaker 4>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was coming back from the doctors.</v>

2030
01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:47.040
<v Speaker 4>This was a typical lyme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens to your brain?</v>

2031
01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:51.330
<v Speaker 4>And I'm the light's red and it's rush </v>
<v Speaker 4>hour.</v>

2032
01:31:51.331 --> 01:31:54.170
<v Speaker 4>You know what Fairfax in sunset is like </v>
<v Speaker 4>at rush hour and uh,</v>

2033
01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:58.740
<v Speaker 4>the light turns from red to green.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I no longer know what green means.</v>

2034
01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.690
<v Speaker 4>My brain is just like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

2035
01:32:01.691 --> 01:32:03.160
<v Speaker 4>what am I supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What am I supposed to do?</v>

2036
01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:06.430
<v Speaker 4>People are flocking and hugging and </v>
<v Speaker 4>finally I'm like,</v>

2037
01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:08.830
<v Speaker 4>Oh crap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Green means go,</v>

2038
01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:09.843
<v Speaker 4>and I looked down to the stick shift and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I no longer had not remember how to </v>

2039
01:32:12.041 --> 01:32:12.874
<v Speaker 4>drive stick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to literally get out and people </v>

2040
01:32:14.471 --> 01:32:15.304
<v Speaker 4>had to push my car into whatever that </v>
<v Speaker 4>little grocery store is right there to </v>

2041
01:32:18.671 --> 01:32:19.090
<v Speaker 4>the bar.</v>

2042
01:32:19.090 --> 01:32:20.740
<v Speaker 4>You crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

2043
01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:21.953
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental skills that I'd had since I </v>

2044
01:32:22.961 --> 01:32:25.390
<v Speaker 4>was 16 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2045
01:32:25.391 --> 01:32:27.070
<v Speaker 4>the ability to go when the light turns </v>
<v Speaker 4>green.</v>

2046
01:32:27.071 --> 01:32:30.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean you watch yourself go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2047
01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:34.090
<v Speaker 4>That must be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you knew how to walk.</v>

2048
01:32:34.091 --> 01:32:36.550
<v Speaker 4>You knew how to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You knew to say there's something wrong.</v>

2049
01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:37.593
<v Speaker 4>You had full access to the language that</v>
<v Speaker 4>had full access to land that couldn't </v>

2050
01:32:40.271 --> 01:32:43.240
<v Speaker 4>write.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started developing like scrabble words</v>

2051
01:32:43.241 --> 01:32:45.400
<v Speaker 4>up when I was writing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I could talk.</v>

2052
01:32:45.401 --> 01:32:48.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I ever lost my powers of </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech that I remember.</v>

2053
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:51.040
<v Speaker 4>What a scary little fucking disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lyme is,</v>

2054
01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:52.180
<v Speaker 4>was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scary,</v>

2055
01:32:52.181 --> 01:32:53.770
<v Speaker 4>creepy disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2056
01:32:53.771 --> 01:32:56.350
<v Speaker 4>this doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was absolutely convinced that the two</v>

2057
01:32:56.351 --> 01:32:57.184
<v Speaker 4>of them were correlated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said that there's something going on </v>

2058
01:32:58.691 --> 01:32:59.524
<v Speaker 4>with lyme disease that produces this </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing where you start seeing these </v>

2059
01:33:03.041 --> 01:33:05.620
<v Speaker 4>fibers coming out of your body and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2060
01:33:05.621 --> 01:33:06.454
<v Speaker 4>we had a ton of people like the sending </v>
<v Speaker 4>videos and show us images and they had </v>

2061
01:33:10.511 --> 01:33:12.130
<v Speaker 4>slides that they had prepared.</v>

2062
01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:12.963
<v Speaker 4>They were convinced these fibers were </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming out of their skin and so doctors </v>

2063
01:33:16.841 --> 01:33:20.920
<v Speaker 4>oftentimes just completely label it as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychosomatic disorder.</v>

2064
01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:22.053
<v Speaker 4>But this one doctor who had it said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that the correlation is lyme </v>

2065
01:33:25.511 --> 01:33:28.690
<v Speaker 4>disease and it completely makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen to what you're saying.</v>

2066
01:33:29.650 --> 01:33:32.560
<v Speaker 4>The other thing is everything has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychosomatic disease,</v>

2067
01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:33.341
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2068
01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:36.440
<v Speaker 4>there's not a wealth of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All I was saying is,</v>

2069
01:33:39.610 --> 01:33:40.443
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was kind of funny now because it's </v>

2070
01:33:42.101 --> 01:33:45.100
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you could kind of avoid.</v>

2071
01:33:45.101 --> 01:33:47.380
<v Speaker 4>It used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were all worried everybody's going to</v>

2072
01:33:47.381 --> 01:33:49.840
<v Speaker 4>die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can joke around about aids now,</v>

2073
01:33:50.110 --> 01:33:51.570
<v Speaker 4>which is rare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2074
01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:56.050
<v Speaker 4>if you look at like the time when Magic </v>
<v Speaker 4>Johnson came out as HIV positive,</v>

2075
01:33:56.051 --> 01:33:57.910
<v Speaker 4>everybody was terrified we're all going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to die.</v>

2076
01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:58.833
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lost a lot of friends during that </v>

2077
01:34:00.371 --> 01:34:00.610
<v Speaker 4>period.</v>

2078
01:34:00.610 --> 01:34:02.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they thought you had aids.</v>

2079
01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:02.993
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I might have lost some friends </v>

2080
01:34:06.551 --> 01:34:07.920
<v Speaker 4>that way too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

2081
01:34:07.950 --> 01:34:09.820
<v Speaker 4>because of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2082
01:34:11.230 --> 01:34:13.360
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was a death sentence for a lot</v>

2083
01:34:13.361 --> 01:34:14.560
<v Speaker 4>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2084
01:34:14.561 --> 01:34:17.320
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a guy on who,</v>

2085
01:34:17.321 --> 01:34:20.710
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a super controversial character.</v>

2086
01:34:20.711 --> 01:34:22.750
<v Speaker 4>He's a biologist at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 4>California,</v>

2087
01:34:22.751 --> 01:34:24.220
<v Speaker 4>Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And have you ever heard of him?</v>

2088
01:34:24.221 --> 01:34:27.520
<v Speaker 4>His name's Peter Duesberg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a weird guy,</v>

2089
01:34:27.521 --> 01:34:28.410
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm,</v>

2090
01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:30.220
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

2091
01:34:30.221 --> 01:34:31.054
<v Speaker 4>his credentials are rock solid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's done some amazing work with cancer </v>

2092
01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:35.430
<v Speaker 4>research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's in me.</v>

2093
01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:37.910
<v Speaker 4>He's a legitimate tenured biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2094
01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:42.400
<v Speaker 4>And he believes that HIV does not cause </v>
<v Speaker 4>aids.</v>

2095
01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:43.473
<v Speaker 4>He believes that AIDS is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause he believes that it's not a </v>

2096
01:34:47.051 --> 01:34:47.884
<v Speaker 4>communicable disease that is caused by </v>
<v Speaker 4>rampant drug abuse and that people </v>

2097
01:34:52.151 --> 01:34:53.960
<v Speaker 4>taking crystal meth and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2098
01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:54.853
<v Speaker 4>amyl nitrate and that in the gay </v>
<v Speaker 4>community there's so much partying that </v>

2099
01:34:58.281 --> 01:34:59.930
<v Speaker 4>they're destroying their immune system.</v>

2100
01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:00.793
<v Speaker 4>And that's why HIV is showing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He believes that HIV is a very weak </v>

2101
01:35:04.011 --> 01:35:04.844
<v Speaker 4>virus and it only shows up in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the immune systems are in the bodies </v>

2102
01:35:08.031 --> 01:35:10.460
<v Speaker 4>of people who have compromised immune </v>
<v Speaker 4>systems already,</v>

2103
01:35:10.461 --> 01:35:12.200
<v Speaker 4>that it's not the cause of the immune </v>
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>

2104
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:14.960
<v Speaker 4>but it's a symptom of a compromised </v>
<v Speaker 4>immune system.</v>

2105
01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:17.840
<v Speaker 4>It can't just be because like abuse </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously,</v>

2106
01:35:17.850 --> 01:35:21.890
<v Speaker 4>because there's tons of people who have </v>
<v Speaker 4>aids who never used drugs in their life,</v>

2107
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:22.671
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Africa,</v>

2108
01:35:22.671 --> 01:35:23.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2109
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:25.310
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's what's weird about that.</v>

2110
01:35:25.311 --> 01:35:26.144
<v Speaker 4>They don't test them for HIV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you get money from AIDS </v>

2111
01:35:28.341 --> 01:35:29.640
<v Speaker 4>organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2112
01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:30.441
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not,</v>

2113
01:35:30.441 --> 01:35:33.320
<v Speaker 4>they're not spending a ton of money to </v>
<v Speaker 4>test people for HIV.</v>

2114
01:35:33.321 --> 01:35:34.760
<v Speaker 4>They're just looking at their t cell </v>
<v Speaker 4>count.</v>

2115
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:36.680
<v Speaker 4>They're looking at people with </v>
<v Speaker 4>compromised immune systems.</v>

2116
01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:39.380
<v Speaker 4>Aids meaning acquired immune deficiency </v>
<v Speaker 4>syndrome.</v>

2117
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:42.560
<v Speaker 4>So they're seeing these people that have</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously compromised immune systems and</v>

2118
01:35:42.561 --> 01:35:43.460
<v Speaker 4>they look at the t cell count.</v>

2119
01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:44.570
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have aids,</v>

2120
01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:47.900
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't mean they have HIV and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what he.</v>

2121
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:48.763
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's fucking super controversial and no </v>

2122
01:35:51.021 --> 01:35:51.854
<v Speaker 4>one agrees with them and no one wants to</v>
<v Speaker 4>debate him either because I had him on </v>

2123
01:35:54.351 --> 01:35:55.184
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People were really angry with me for </v>

2124
01:35:55.611 --> 01:35:56.421
<v Speaker 4>having a lawn like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2125
01:35:56.421 --> 01:35:57.254
<v Speaker 4>I have zero background in biology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's a fucking professor at the </v>

2126
01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:01.520
<v Speaker 4>University of California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Berkeley.</v>

2127
01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.930
<v Speaker 4>He's written all these articles about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2128
01:36:02.931 --> 01:36:04.250
<v Speaker 4>He's talked to all these people about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2129
01:36:04.251 --> 01:36:07.880
<v Speaker 4>I want to hear what he has to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are so angry at all,</v>

2130
01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:10.550
<v Speaker 4>but as you look into it deeper and </v>
<v Speaker 4>deeper,</v>

2131
01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:13.940
<v Speaker 4>it demands that someone shot them down </v>
<v Speaker 4>like some.</v>

2132
01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:18.410
<v Speaker 4>Some biologist should have a debate with</v>
<v Speaker 4>them and show step by step wise,</v>

2133
01:36:18.411 --> 01:36:20.210
<v Speaker 4>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if he's just running around,</v>

2134
01:36:20.211 --> 01:36:22.490
<v Speaker 4>they're saying that and everybody avoids</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

2135
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:24.710
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people gonna get sucked into </v>
<v Speaker 4>that rabbit hole.</v>

2136
01:36:25.130 --> 01:36:25.690
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

2137
01:36:25.690 --> 01:36:27.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't obviously don't know who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2138
01:36:27.321 --> 01:36:29.120
<v Speaker 4>I doubt he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I highly,</v>

2139
01:36:29.121 --> 01:36:29.954
<v Speaker 4>highly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>highly doubt that all those other </v>

2140
01:36:31.971 --> 01:36:34.520
<v Speaker 4>biologists are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this one guy is correct,</v>

2141
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:35.803
<v Speaker 4>but it might be both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be that HIV does cause aids at </v>

2142
01:36:39.441 --> 01:36:44.120
<v Speaker 4>AIDS is a communicable disease and also </v>
<v Speaker 4>that drug abuse accentuates it.</v>

2143
01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:46.310
<v Speaker 4>That makes it much worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So instead,</v>

2144
01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:47.373
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's looking at this one factor when </v>

2145
01:36:48.951 --> 01:36:49.784
<v Speaker 4>this one factor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which absolutely everybody knows when </v>

2146
01:36:51.681 --> 01:36:54.770
<v Speaker 4>you're doing crystal meth and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing a meal nitrate and all these crazy</v>

2147
01:36:54.771 --> 01:36:55.604
<v Speaker 4>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people are doing anybody doing </v>

2148
01:36:57.021 --> 01:36:58.820
<v Speaker 4>that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have a fucked up body.</v>

2149
01:36:59.110 --> 01:37:00.610
<v Speaker 4>Like it's going to compromise your </v>
<v Speaker 4>immune system.</v>

2150
01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:02.660
<v Speaker 4>You drink every night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it compromises your immune system.</v>

2151
01:37:02.661 --> 01:37:03.494
<v Speaker 4>Any drug abuse is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if that drug abuse is going on and </v>

2152
01:37:08.130 --> 01:37:10.880
<v Speaker 4>it's coinciding with an infectious </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease,</v>

2153
01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:13.010
<v Speaker 4>it just makes sense that it would </v>
<v Speaker 4>accentuate it.</v>

2154
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:16.040
<v Speaker 4>That's what I probably think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But his path,</v>

2155
01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:21.340
<v Speaker 4>the path that he's chosen to pursue is </v>
<v Speaker 4>just extremely controversial.</v>

2156
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:22.303
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people think that he's antisemitic and </v>

2157
01:37:24.001 --> 01:37:27.320
<v Speaker 4>then he's anti gay anti this and anti </v>
<v Speaker 4>that because of it.</v>

2158
01:37:27.321 --> 01:37:28.154
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of weird stuff gets tossed around </v>

2159
01:37:30.730 --> 01:37:32.640
<v Speaker 4>a crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2160
01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:33.561
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2161
01:37:33.561 --> 01:37:35.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure he's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dunno.</v>

2162
01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:36.163
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do I know.</v>

2163
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:37.123
<v Speaker 4>But for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did they have to do to you to get </v>

2164
01:37:39.441 --> 01:37:43.370
<v Speaker 4>you off the lyme disease and isn't lyme </v>
<v Speaker 4>something you keep semi-permanently?</v>

2165
01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:45.440
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2166
01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:46.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in bed for three,</v>

2167
01:37:46.731 --> 01:37:47.564
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the year it was in bed for about three </v>

2168
01:37:48.951 --> 01:37:49.784
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had to pull me off antibiotics </v>

2169
01:37:51.411 --> 01:37:53.300
<v Speaker 4>because my stomach lining started </v>
<v Speaker 4>bleeding out.</v>

2170
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:55.940
<v Speaker 4>There was nothing else maybe you could </v>
<v Speaker 4>for me and</v>

2171
01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:59.820
<v Speaker 3>just tell you the full story and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to end my life.</v>

2172
01:37:59.821 --> 01:38:01.920
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at that point I was functional but</v>

2173
01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:02.873
<v Speaker 3>10 percent of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe like an hour a day I couldn't </v>

2174
01:38:04.891 --> 01:38:05.724
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing I was going to be was </v>

2175
01:38:07.171 --> 01:38:09.660
<v Speaker 3>burdening my friends and my family and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was just like,</v>

2176
01:38:09.670 --> 01:38:10.680
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time,</v>

2177
01:38:10.710 --> 01:38:14.570
<v Speaker 3>30 m and a in the middle of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2178
01:38:14.770 --> 01:38:15.603
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was when I was still living in Los </v>

2179
01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:17.723
<v Speaker 3>Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine showed up my door and </v>

2180
01:38:18.631 --> 01:38:21.360
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going surfing your fucking mind.</v>

2181
01:38:21.361 --> 01:38:24.450
<v Speaker 3>I can't walk across the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I literally,</v>

2182
01:38:24.490 --> 01:38:28.020
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do it and she wouldn't shut </v>
<v Speaker 3>up and wouldn't leave,</v>

2183
01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:28.953
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't leave and wouldn't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And after like it just hard to make </v>

2184
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:32.703
<v Speaker 3>compliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to drown me four hours of </v>

2185
01:38:34.861 --> 01:38:36.480
<v Speaker 3>this or three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2186
01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:38.880
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go surfing today.</v>

2187
01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:40.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the worst that can happen?</v>

2188
01:38:40.561 --> 01:38:41.394
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll always kill myself tomorrow and a </v>

2189
01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:44.543
<v Speaker 3>drag matt to sunset beach and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally sort of had to walk me to the </v>

2190
01:38:47.971 --> 01:38:48.480
<v Speaker 3>car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2191
01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:51.610
<v Speaker 3>Take you by the shoulders because I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really weak and you know,</v>

2192
01:38:51.630 --> 01:38:54.000
<v Speaker 3>they gave me a board the size of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cadillac and the bigger the board,</v>

2193
01:38:54.001 --> 01:38:56.850
<v Speaker 3>the easier it is to serve and this was </v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous and it was a tiny day.</v>

2194
01:38:56.851 --> 01:39:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Like waves were like two feet at best </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was so crappy.</v>

2195
01:39:00.211 --> 01:39:01.044
<v Speaker 3>Nobody was even out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the water was warm and they sort of </v>

2196
01:39:02.911 --> 01:39:03.744
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took me by the elbow and they </v>

2197
01:39:03.961 --> 01:39:04.794
<v Speaker 3>walked me out to the break and I was out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and I knew how to surf a little </v>

2198
01:39:07.171 --> 01:39:09.060
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had been a long time side surfed at that</v>

2199
01:39:09.061 --> 01:39:12.170
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but 30 seconds later a wave came in.</v>

2200
01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:13.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened.</v>

2201
01:39:13.321 --> 01:39:14.430
<v Speaker 3>Muscle memory took over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2202
01:39:14.431 --> 01:39:17.040
<v Speaker 3>But I spun my board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I paddled a couple of times and I popped</v>

2203
01:39:17.041 --> 01:39:20.400
<v Speaker 3>up and I just popped up in a dimension I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't even know existed.</v>

2204
01:39:20.401 --> 01:39:21.234
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the eye panoramic vision I felt </v>

2205
01:39:22.711 --> 01:39:27.680
<v Speaker 3>like I could see out of the back of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>head and I felt amazing.</v>

2206
01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Felt like that kind of full throttle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetime and slowed down.</v>

2207
01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:34.200
<v Speaker 3>None of it made any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt so good.</v>

2208
01:39:34.201 --> 01:39:37.310
<v Speaker 3>I caught like four more waves that day </v>
<v Speaker 3>and by the fifth wave I was,</v>

2209
01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:40.680
<v Speaker 3>I was disassembled it Kinda put me back </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the car and drove me home.</v>

2210
01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:45.040
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so sick after that that I was,</v>

2211
01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:45.933
<v Speaker 3>I got into bed and people had to bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>me food for like two weeks because I </v>

2212
01:39:48.481 --> 01:39:51.810
<v Speaker 3>couldn't walk to my kitchen which is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 60 feet away and I was exhausted.</v>

2213
01:39:53.190 --> 01:39:56.130
<v Speaker 3>But on the Fifteenth Day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which the day I could walk again,</v>

2214
01:39:56.910 --> 01:40:00.690
<v Speaker 3>caught another ride back to the beach </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I did it again and again.</v>

2215
01:40:00.691 --> 01:40:03.600
<v Speaker 3>I had this crazy altered state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness experience.</v>

2216
01:40:03.601 --> 01:40:04.710
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2217
01:40:04.711 --> 01:40:05.544
<v Speaker 3>I was disassembled this time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was like 13 days that I was in </v>

2218
01:40:08.071 --> 01:40:11.230
<v Speaker 3>bed and I did it again and over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>course of about six to eight months with</v>

2219
01:40:11.231 --> 01:40:13.650
<v Speaker 3>the only thing I was doing differently </v>
<v Speaker 3>in my life was surfing.</v>

2220
01:40:14.010 --> 01:40:14.843
<v Speaker 3>I went from about 10 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>functionality to about 80 percent </v>

2221
01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:18.144
<v Speaker 3>functionality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my first question is the fuck is </v>

2222
01:40:20.611 --> 01:40:21.361
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2223
01:40:21.361 --> 01:40:22.194
<v Speaker 3>Like as I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>surfing is not a known cure for chronic </v>

2224
01:40:25.261 --> 01:40:26.310
<v Speaker 3>autoimmune.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2225
01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:27.653
<v Speaker 3>So I laid out on a John Question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing was I backgrounds is a </v>

2226
01:40:31.531 --> 01:40:32.364
<v Speaker 3>science writer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like I don't have quasi mystical </v>

2227
01:40:35.371 --> 01:40:38.250
<v Speaker 3>experiences and I sure as hell don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have them while surfing,</v>

2228
01:40:38.251 --> 01:40:41.130
<v Speaker 3>which has got to be the flakest thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

2229
01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:45.120
<v Speaker 3>And I'm so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really believed that even though I was</v>

2230
01:40:45.121 --> 01:40:45.954
<v Speaker 3>feeling better lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only fatal if it gets into your brain </v>

2231
01:40:48.450 --> 01:40:50.730
<v Speaker 3>and I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty sure that even though I was</v>

2232
01:40:50.731 --> 01:40:51.564
<v Speaker 3>starting to feel physically better that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the disease had crept into my brain </v>

2233
01:40:54.251 --> 01:40:57.220
<v Speaker 3>because why else would I be having these</v>
<v Speaker 3>mystical experiences?</v>

2234
01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:00.220
<v Speaker 3>I must be totally losing my mind about </v>
<v Speaker 3>to die.</v>

2235
01:41:00.221 --> 01:41:04.660
<v Speaker 3>And I lit out on a giant quest beer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At what the hell happened and you know,</v>

2236
01:41:04.690 --> 01:41:08.260
<v Speaker 3>very quickly discovered that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>states of consciousness have names.</v>

2237
01:41:08.261 --> 01:41:09.094
<v Speaker 3>We called them flow states and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>version of what happened to me health </v>

2238
01:41:12.341 --> 01:41:13.174
<v Speaker 3>wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is her Benson did some of the </v>

2239
01:41:15.371 --> 01:41:17.650
<v Speaker 3>work on the neurobiology of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's at Harvard,</v>

2240
01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:19.810
<v Speaker 3>he wrote about it in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the breakout principle,</v>

2241
01:41:19.811 --> 01:41:20.644
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the neurochemicals that show up in </v>

2242
01:41:23.871 --> 01:41:25.030
<v Speaker 3>flow to things happen.</v>

2243
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:27.160
<v Speaker 3>So one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you move into flow,</v>

2244
01:41:27.370 --> 01:41:29.320
<v Speaker 3>there's a global release of nitric </v>
<v Speaker 3>oxide.</v>

2245
01:41:29.321 --> 01:41:31.570
<v Speaker 3>It's a gas as signaling molecules </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere in the body.</v>

2246
01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:32.433
<v Speaker 3>What it does is it flushes all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress hormones out of your system and </v>

2247
01:41:35.981 --> 01:41:37.960
<v Speaker 3>it pumps you full of these kind of feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>good performance.</v>

2248
01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:42.980
<v Speaker 3>Tangent line is an essentially any </v>
<v Speaker 3>autoimmune conditions you nervous system</v>

2249
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:46.060
<v Speaker 3>gone haywire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you go into flow,</v>

2250
01:41:46.061 --> 01:41:47.620
<v Speaker 3>it resets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your nervous system,</v>

2251
01:41:47.710 --> 01:41:50.950
<v Speaker 3>calms everything down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets rid of all the stress hormones,</v>

2252
01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:52.960
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff and it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when.</v>

2253
01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:56.170
<v Speaker 3>The worst part about lyme is you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even know what normal is.</v>

2254
01:41:56.260 --> 01:41:59.560
<v Speaker 3>Like it has been so long since you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>felt normal,</v>

2255
01:41:59.561 --> 01:42:01.540
<v Speaker 3>like you don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't even find it on a map,</v>

2256
01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:03.400
<v Speaker 3>so suddenly like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2257
01:42:03.850 --> 01:42:05.410
<v Speaker 3>this is what normal feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2258
01:42:05.411 --> 01:42:06.820
<v Speaker 3>the other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2259
01:42:06.821 --> 01:42:09.510
<v Speaker 3>the positive neurochemicals that show up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and float dopamine,</v>

2260
01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:12.190
<v Speaker 3>Serotonin and Nanda [inaudible] see </v>
<v Speaker 3>towson.</v>

2261
01:42:12.191 --> 01:42:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Those are all immune system boosters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they do a ton of other stuff,</v>

2262
01:42:15.041 --> 01:42:16.540
<v Speaker 3>enhance cognitive performance and </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2263
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:19.930
<v Speaker 3>but her Benson at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think this may be overstretching,</v>

2264
01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:20.773
<v Speaker 3>it will have a budget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he has kind of gone on record and </v>

2265
01:42:23.741 --> 01:42:28.741
<v Speaker 3>said he thinks most cases of so called </v>
<v Speaker 3>spontaneous healing actually have a flow</v>

2266
01:42:29.231 --> 01:42:31.960
<v Speaker 3>state at their heart and it's this </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular process that's doing it.</v>

2267
01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.270
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It almost.</v>

2268
01:42:34.410 --> 01:42:37.080
<v Speaker 4>It makes sense if you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the opposite,</v>

2269
01:42:37.081 --> 01:42:37.530
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2270
01:42:37.530 --> 01:42:40.590
<v Speaker 4>What is the big diminisher of people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>health?</v>

2271
01:42:41.190 --> 01:42:42.600
<v Speaker 4>It's stress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2272
01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:46.560
<v Speaker 4>It's stress and depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad feelings,</v>

2273
01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:50.850
<v Speaker 4>and it's always followed by degrading of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the immune system.</v>

2274
01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:54.060
<v Speaker 4>Health goes poor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That totally makes sense.</v>

2275
01:42:54.270 --> 01:42:55.103
<v Speaker 4>If you're happy and either achieve that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I meant earlier when I said </v>

2276
01:42:57.151 --> 01:42:58.800
<v Speaker 4>every disease is psychosomatic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2277
01:42:58.830 --> 01:43:00.990
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm not saying there aren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>physical causes,</v>

2278
01:43:01.290 --> 01:43:02.210
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2279
01:43:02.250 --> 01:43:02.780
<v Speaker 4>whatever</v>

2280
01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:06.650
<v Speaker 3>I used to think about the mind body </v>
<v Speaker 3>split is absolute complete nonsense,</v>

2281
01:43:06.651 --> 01:43:08.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We now know that there's as many kind of</v>

2282
01:43:08.931 --> 01:43:11.770
<v Speaker 3>neurons in your heart and your stomach </v>
<v Speaker 3>as you had in your brain until</v>

2283
01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:13.330
<v Speaker 4>body system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2284
01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:14.173
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you have concentrated on </v>
<v Speaker 4>probiotics and the probiotics have </v>

2285
01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:21.980
<v Speaker 4>unconsciousness and the way you feel way</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel.</v>

2286
01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:23.810
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Consciousness.</v>

2287
01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:26.060
<v Speaker 4>How they think it even forms your </v>
<v Speaker 4>personality.</v>

2288
01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.770
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The microbiome.</v>

2289
01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:28.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2290
01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:29.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing.</v>

2291
01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:31.320
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>candy,</v>

2292
01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:34.120
<v Speaker 3>which is another one of those diseases </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody believes you have.</v>

2293
01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:35.153
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're on antibiotics for three </v>

2294
01:43:36.701 --> 01:43:37.534
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've totally throw off the human </v>

2295
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:41.960
<v Speaker 3>microbiome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that happens when,</v>

2296
01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:44.350
<v Speaker 3>when candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get overrun by yeast,</v>

2297
01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:46.840
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is you get extremely,</v>

2298
01:43:46.841 --> 01:43:49.210
<v Speaker 3>extremely anxious and paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2299
01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:52.370
<v Speaker 3>Because yeast feeds on sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is fast</v>

2300
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:53.203
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I make you super anxious and </v>

2301
01:43:54.531 --> 01:43:55.364
<v Speaker 2>paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna want to eat sugar because </v>

2302
01:43:57.111 --> 01:43:57.944
<v Speaker 2>you're going to want the fast energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you might have to fight or do </v>

2303
01:43:59.811 --> 01:44:00.644
<v Speaker 2>something so you can get taken over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a chemical imbalance and it makes </v>

2304
01:44:05.001 --> 01:44:08.810
<v Speaker 2>you paranoid and anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what it really is is is the east set</v>

2305
01:44:08.811 --> 01:44:09.644
<v Speaker 2>craving sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it totally takes over your </v>

2306
01:44:11.691 --> 01:44:12.524
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and I always thought that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was interesting because if you were to </v>

2307
01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:16.190
<v Speaker 2>really poke at people and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2308
01:44:16.191 --> 01:44:17.960
<v Speaker 2>what is really you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>

2309
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.823
<v Speaker 2>what do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gunna often come back to their </v>

2310
01:44:21.111 --> 01:44:23.090
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will I am my emotions?</v>

2311
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:24.103
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's this tilting your microbiome </v>

2312
01:44:26.150 --> 01:44:26.983
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing that happens is they </v>

2313
01:44:27.381 --> 01:44:29.240
<v Speaker 2>hijack your emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2314
01:44:29.241 --> 01:44:30.074
<v Speaker 2>So it can get the food at once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're definitely not completely in </v>

2315
01:44:33.321 --> 01:44:34.340
<v Speaker 2>control of your emotions.</v>

2316
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:36.140
<v Speaker 2>What's so difficult?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we look in the mirror,</v>

2317
01:44:36.141 --> 01:44:38.330
<v Speaker 2>we see an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see a unique thing,</v>

2318
01:44:38.331 --> 01:44:40.240
<v Speaker 2>but what we are is we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2319
01:44:40.290 --> 01:44:41.120
<v Speaker 2>you're a hybrid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2320
01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:41.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

2321
01:44:41.631 --> 01:44:43.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one of the questions,</v>

2322
01:44:43.610 --> 01:44:44.780
<v Speaker 2>and nobody has an answer to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

2323
01:44:44.781 --> 01:44:45.920
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really neat,</v>

2324
01:44:45.921 --> 01:44:48.410
<v Speaker 2>so if you study flow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you study optimal performance,</v>

2325
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:49.970
<v Speaker 2>and I've been asking people this </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

2326
01:44:49.971 --> 01:44:50.781
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2327
01:44:50.781 --> 01:44:54.170
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you how it works in the brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure and some of the body,</v>

2328
01:44:54.171 --> 01:44:58.280
<v Speaker 2>but like if I'm going to drop into flow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does my microbiome help?</v>

2329
01:44:58.490 --> 01:45:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Is it's a collective experience or if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's optimal performance,</v>

2330
01:45:02.241 --> 01:45:03.074
<v Speaker 2>is it everything in the system?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody can even start to poke at those </v>

2331
01:45:06.111 --> 01:45:06.944
<v Speaker 2>questions but would super interesting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me if they think it affects your </v>

2332
01:45:08.751 --> 01:45:09.584
<v Speaker 2>personality and they think it affects </v>
<v Speaker 2>your moods and it they think it effects </v>

2333
01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:14.720
<v Speaker 2>your intelligence level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your Iq level.</v>

2334
01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:15.553
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all these new things are </v>

2335
01:45:16.431 --> 01:45:20.420
<v Speaker 2>constantly correlating on a daily basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your gut biome,</v>

2336
01:45:20.730 --> 01:45:23.960
<v Speaker 2>the mean and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and taking in probiotics.</v>

2337
01:45:24.230 --> 01:45:25.063
<v Speaker 2>For me it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's vastly improved my sick to healthy </v>

2338
01:45:28.671 --> 01:45:29.380
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2339
01:45:29.380 --> 01:45:33.020
<v Speaker 2>That for sure that for sure without yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>without a question.</v>

2340
01:45:33.230 --> 01:45:36.440
<v Speaker 2>No question whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once I started eating Kimchi,</v>

2341
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:38.780
<v Speaker 2>the Kimchi is a big one for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat that stuff all the time.</v>

2342
01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:42.290
<v Speaker 2>I drink Kombucha daily every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drink that stuff.</v>

2343
01:45:42.291 --> 01:45:47.291
<v Speaker 2>I eat a lot of yogurt and I'm constantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking in different kinds of probiotics.</v>

2344
01:45:47.730 --> 01:45:48.563
<v Speaker 2>Once I started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also did this thing called total </v>

2345
01:45:50.841 --> 01:45:52.210
<v Speaker 2>gut health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an audit,</v>

2346
01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:53.113
<v Speaker 2>a thing that we sell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just try to get as many different </v>

2347
01:45:56.031 --> 01:45:56.864
<v Speaker 2>forms of probiotics and as possible and </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of that I'm fucking constantly </v>

2348
01:45:59.991 --> 01:46:01.400
<v Speaker 2>traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I travel constantly.</v>

2349
01:46:01.401 --> 01:46:02.234
<v Speaker 2>I rarely get sick and if I do it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a day or two and then it's gone and I </v>

2350
01:46:06.331 --> 01:46:06.780
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

2351
01:46:06.780 --> 01:46:08.690
<v Speaker 2>I credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the probiotics.</v>

2352
01:46:08.691 --> 01:46:12.080
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Kimchi and Kombucha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those are two big ones.</v>

2353
01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:15.860
<v Speaker 2>I also noticed in this could we meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about but because there might be</v>

2354
01:46:15.861 --> 01:46:16.694
<v Speaker 2>no science here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I stopped once I started taking </v>

2355
01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:21.680
<v Speaker 2>probiotics regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped tearing things as much,</v>

2356
01:46:21.681 --> 01:46:25.460
<v Speaker 2>tearing muscles for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I could be done to the core of that.</v>

2357
01:46:25.461 --> 01:46:27.620
<v Speaker 2>I've never read anything about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's one thing that I noticed.</v>

2358
01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're just not doing stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're not as anxious.</v>

2359
01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:32.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing stupid shit.</v>

2360
01:46:33.710 --> 01:46:35.630
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2361
01:46:35.631 --> 01:46:36.464
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2362
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:37.460
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2363
01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:40.130
<v Speaker 2>it is incredible to think of yourself as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a community.</v>

2364
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:43.370
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible to think of yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a weird ecosystem.</v>

2365
01:46:43.371 --> 01:46:44.810
<v Speaker 2>I read an article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you could.</v>

2366
01:46:45.210 --> 01:46:46.200
<v Speaker 2>I think it's unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2367
01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:48.980
<v Speaker 2>I think it's on Forbes that I wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 2>called you or not you.</v>

2368
01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Is that on your website</v>

2369
01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:52.590
<v Speaker 4>now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was an article I wrote for my,</v>

2370
01:46:52.591 --> 01:46:53.790
<v Speaker 4>for my blog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you go to,</v>

2371
01:46:53.791 --> 01:46:57.060
<v Speaker 4>I wrote a blog for Forbes for like four </v>
<v Speaker 4>or five years called far from tears.</v>

2372
01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:58.273
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think the piece is called you are </v>

2373
01:47:00.330 --> 01:47:03.210
<v Speaker 4>not you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't until recently that we had</v>

2374
01:47:03.211 --> 01:47:04.044
<v Speaker 4>the knowledge to understand this and </v>
<v Speaker 4>also the time to actually sit down and </v>

2375
01:47:07.201 --> 01:47:09.930
<v Speaker 4>contemplate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people for the last,</v>

2376
01:47:09.931 --> 01:47:11.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

2377
01:47:11.041 --> 01:47:12.780
<v Speaker 4>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years people have been people.</v>

2378
01:47:13.290 --> 01:47:18.290
<v Speaker 4>It's been a fucking tooth and nail claw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the struggle to stay alive.</v>

2379
01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:21.360
<v Speaker 4>You haven't had time to contemplate on </v>
<v Speaker 4>your gut biome,</v>

2380
01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:22.613
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is all like really new stuff to </v>

2381
01:47:23.851 --> 01:47:25.830
<v Speaker 4>human beings for us to be even </v>
<v Speaker 4>considering.</v>

2382
01:47:25.831 --> 01:47:26.664
<v Speaker 4>So are cemented observations and ideas </v>
<v Speaker 4>of who we are now being challenged by </v>

2383
01:47:31.711 --> 01:47:32.544
<v Speaker 4>this notion that no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a community of fucking weird </v>

2384
01:47:35.281 --> 01:47:37.350
<v Speaker 4>bacteria that you need.</v>

2385
01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:40.980
<v Speaker 4>Like that's the thing that kills you the</v>
<v Speaker 4>most about those antibiotics.</v>

2386
01:47:40.981 --> 01:47:42.850
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It kills all the good stuff too.</v>

2387
01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:45.490
<v Speaker 4>Like you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that was A.</v>

2388
01:47:45.610 --> 01:47:46.051
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2389
01:47:46.051 --> 01:47:46.884
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I often think that one of the hardest </v>

2390
01:47:48.601 --> 01:47:49.434
<v Speaker 4>parts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure this happens with a lot of </v>

2391
01:47:50.101 --> 01:47:50.934
<v Speaker 4>other diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've noticed it with lime and I've </v>

2392
01:47:52.681 --> 01:47:57.180
<v Speaker 4>talked to a lot of other lyme patients,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the antibiotics fuck you up so much.</v>

2393
01:47:57.181 --> 01:48:00.780
<v Speaker 4>And they mimic when your microbiome gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>that scurry,</v>

2394
01:48:00.781 --> 01:48:05.781
<v Speaker 4>it mimics the symptoms of lyme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So sometimes you can't even tell you the</v>

2395
01:48:05.851 --> 01:48:07.980
<v Speaker 4>antibiotics actually might be making you</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel better,</v>

2396
01:48:08.190 --> 01:48:10.590
<v Speaker 4>but you can't tell the lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe dying not,</v>

2397
01:48:10.591 --> 01:48:11.424
<v Speaker 4>but you still feel so crappy because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what the antibiotics have done to your </v>

2398
01:48:13.621 --> 01:48:16.170
<v Speaker 4>symptoms and it feels like the same kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of ailment.</v>

2399
01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:17.393
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

2400
01:48:18.930 --> 01:48:19.763
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had staff a few years back and I took </v>

2401
01:48:21.511 --> 01:48:24.520
<v Speaker 1>a really strong antibiotic for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2402
01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:27.030
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I felt like was a light </v>
<v Speaker 1>headed.</v>

2403
01:48:27.031 --> 01:48:28.500
<v Speaker 1>And weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2404
01:48:28.501 --> 01:48:32.640
<v Speaker 1>this is a weird feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just felt really like,</v>

2405
01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:35.430
<v Speaker 1>how long were you on antibiotics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

2406
01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:37.620
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that long because I caught it </v>
<v Speaker 1>really early.</v>

2407
01:48:37.650 --> 01:48:39.510
<v Speaker 1>My friend take caught it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was super lucky.</v>

2408
01:48:39.511 --> 01:48:40.344
<v Speaker 1>We were at the airport and I was wearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>shorts and he just looked down at my </v>

2409
01:48:42.031 --> 01:48:43.950
<v Speaker 1>calf and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that on your leg?</v>

2410
01:48:44.130 --> 01:48:44.963
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2411
01:48:45.250 --> 01:48:46.800
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got a little zip seals,</v>

2412
01:48:46.801 --> 01:48:47.491
<v Speaker 1>little zits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2413
01:48:47.491 --> 01:48:47.941
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2414
01:48:47.941 --> 01:48:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I think you have staff like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking serious?</v>

2415
01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like little zits.</v>

2416
01:48:51.661 --> 01:48:52.560
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go get it.</v>

2417
01:48:52.561 --> 01:48:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Checked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It checked out.</v>

2418
01:48:53.701 --> 01:48:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Staff immediately,</v>

2419
01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:55.853
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antibiotics and when it was gone pretty </v>

2420
01:48:58.771 --> 01:48:59.730
<v Speaker 1>far pretty quickly.</v>

2421
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.420
<v Speaker 1>But I remember feeling like a shell for </v>
<v Speaker 1>four weeks.</v>

2422
01:49:03.450 --> 01:49:05.790
<v Speaker 1>I just felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was like,</v>

2423
01:49:06.150 --> 01:49:06.983
<v Speaker 1>I was probably down to like 50 or 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of what I used to be until it </v>

2424
01:49:10.081 --> 01:49:13.860
<v Speaker 1>all sort of built back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But luckily I was super on the ball when</v>

2425
01:49:13.861 --> 01:49:14.694
<v Speaker 1>it comes to probiotics and replenishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>my gut biome because I know some people </v>

2426
01:49:18.181 --> 01:49:21.480
<v Speaker 1>that just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just sort of try to keep on keeping</v>

2427
01:49:21.481 --> 01:49:22.314
<v Speaker 1>on and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating cheeseburgers and fries </v>

2428
01:49:24.541 --> 01:49:25.374
<v Speaker 1>and you don't ever get probiotics in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your system and your gut biome suffers </v>

2429
01:49:28.770 --> 01:49:29.603
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go on this sort of spiral of </v>

2430
01:49:31.801 --> 01:49:33.870
<v Speaker 1>deterioration because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Health wise</v>

2431
01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:36.950
<v Speaker 4>it's critical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did that.</v>

2432
01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:38.053
<v Speaker 4>So why did your lyme gets so bad?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I've never heard of anybody having </v>

2433
01:49:42.221 --> 01:49:44.710
<v Speaker 4>it for three years like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it took them,</v>

2434
01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:48.610
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it took them almost a year</v>

2435
01:49:48.850 --> 01:49:51.010
<v Speaker 2>to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's really what it is.</v>

2436
01:49:51.011 --> 01:49:53.020
<v Speaker 2>It's how long do you have it before you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get there?</v>

2437
01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:55.390
<v Speaker 2>So it took them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2438
01:49:55.391 --> 01:49:57.880
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was tested for everything because they</v>

2439
01:49:57.881 --> 01:49:58.900
<v Speaker 2>just didn't like the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2440
01:49:59.000 --> 01:49:59.833
<v Speaker 2>the guy didn't believe I have line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody believed that I had lyme since </v>

2441
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:02.710
<v Speaker 2>the AIDS guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same guy.</v>

2442
01:50:02.711 --> 01:50:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Same Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't get a second opinion.</v>

2443
01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2444
01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:07.840
<v Speaker 2>was 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was poor.</v>

2445
01:50:07.841 --> 01:50:08.780
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always say this,</v>

2446
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:10.240
<v Speaker 2>my healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was my doctor that,</v>

2447
01:50:10.241 --> 01:50:11.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

2448
01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:15.100
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because of that,</v>

2449
01:50:15.130 --> 01:50:17.350
<v Speaker 2>because by the way I did when I finally </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

2450
01:50:17.351 --> 01:50:19.330
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta like just go out and network and</v>

2451
01:50:19.331 --> 01:50:21.760
<v Speaker 2>find infectious disease doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember walking in,</v>

2452
01:50:21.761 --> 01:50:23.110
<v Speaker 2>I told him all my symptoms and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2453
01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:25.770
<v Speaker 2>you don't think I'm crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you like I,</v>

2454
01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:27.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly wondering my </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypochondriac.</v>

2455
01:50:27.490 --> 01:50:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Am I making this shit up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2456
01:50:28.781 --> 01:50:30.490
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looked right at me and said,</v>

2457
01:50:30.491 --> 01:50:31.480
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're making it up.</v>

2458
01:50:31.481 --> 01:50:33.010
<v Speaker 2>I think you have lyme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's test you for it.</v>

2459
01:50:33.110 --> 01:50:35.680
<v Speaker 2>And sure enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So did you call the other guy up and go,</v>

2460
01:50:35.681 --> 01:50:36.520
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck face,</v>

2461
01:50:36.521 --> 01:50:39.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't have aids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

2462
01:50:39.850 --> 01:50:41.640
<v Speaker 2>I'd be so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2463
01:50:41.650 --> 01:50:44.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean the incentive of someone getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>$77,</v>

2464
01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:45.730
<v Speaker 2>$7 to treat you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2465
01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:48.310
<v Speaker 2>not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they put you on.</v>

2466
01:50:48.311 --> 01:50:49.144
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I blame the insurance company is much </v>

2467
01:50:49.901 --> 01:50:51.850
<v Speaker 2>more than the doctors on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

2468
01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:54.580
<v Speaker 2>So they put you on these hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics.</v>

2469
01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:55.663
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean how is that how one year </v>

2470
01:50:58.601 --> 01:51:00.940
<v Speaker 2>without diagnosing become two years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment?</v>

2471
01:51:01.450 --> 01:51:02.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2472
01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:07.150
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just was not getting better.</v>

2473
01:51:07.151 --> 01:51:07.541
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

2474
01:51:07.541 --> 01:51:09.370
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even after they found it,</v>

2475
01:51:09.371 --> 01:51:10.000
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2476
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:10.833
<v Speaker 2>it took me a long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was probably on the antibiotics for </v>

2477
01:51:13.601 --> 01:51:14.434
<v Speaker 2>like four or five months before I even </v>
<v Speaker 2>started getting made it to the better </v>

2478
01:51:19.541 --> 01:51:21.310
<v Speaker 2>and then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a long,</v>

2479
01:51:21.311 --> 01:51:23.650
<v Speaker 2>slow process that scares the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2480
01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:25.450
<v Speaker 2>That's all coming from a tick.</v>

2481
01:51:27.730 --> 01:51:28.750
<v Speaker 2>A buddy of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

2482
01:51:28.751 --> 01:51:30.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his son got it.</v>

2483
01:51:30.131 --> 01:51:32.380
<v Speaker 2>And is the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Took him to a pediatrician.</v>

2484
01:51:32.381 --> 01:51:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

2485
01:51:33.461 --> 01:51:36.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's long and he starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting bell's Palsy.</v>

2486
01:51:36.311 --> 01:51:40.420
<v Speaker 2>We're half his face was paralyzed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then finally they test them for it.</v>

2487
01:51:41.170 --> 01:51:42.260
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met a,</v>

2488
01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:43.440
<v Speaker 2>a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2489
01:51:43.490 --> 01:51:45.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess this happens,</v>

2490
01:51:45.370 --> 01:51:47.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it produces really bad arthritis,</v>

2491
01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:48.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2492
01:51:49.330 --> 01:51:50.163
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I guess it can go either it gets </v>

2493
01:51:51.611 --> 01:51:52.444
<v Speaker 2>into your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes either towards your brain or in </v>

2494
01:51:54.581 --> 01:51:55.414
<v Speaker 2>that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm,</v>

2495
01:51:55.450 --> 01:51:57.250
<v Speaker 2>I met a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful,</v>

2496
01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:58.420
<v Speaker 2>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>

2497
01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Probably late twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you looked at her hands,</v>

2498
01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:04.360
<v Speaker 2>look like they had the hands of like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred year old woman.</v>

2499
01:52:04.361 --> 01:52:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Her fingers had literally twisted almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>into circles.</v>

2500
01:52:07.361 --> 01:52:10.120
<v Speaker 2>I'd never seen anything like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was insane.</v>

2501
01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:11.900
<v Speaker 2>And again it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2502
01:52:11.950 --> 01:52:14.740
<v Speaker 2>it was live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really a strange thing.</v>

2503
01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:17.380
<v Speaker 2>How long did she have it before the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of thing.</v>

2504
01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:19.733
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you don't suffer any </v>

2505
01:52:20.561 --> 01:52:21.670
<v Speaker 2>repercussions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2506
01:52:21.671 --> 01:52:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've totally back to normal.</v>

2507
01:52:26.081 --> 01:52:26.531
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2508
01:52:26.531 --> 01:52:28.170
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2509
01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:30.080
<v Speaker 2>don't ever recover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2510
01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:30.933
<v Speaker 2>it took me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was the surfing and the flow and </v>

2511
01:52:33.011 --> 01:52:35.500
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that work got me back to about 80.</v>

2512
01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:40.740
<v Speaker 2>It took a long time to go from 80 all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way to 100 percent and I worked with</v>

2513
01:52:41.861 --> 01:52:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Mark Gordon then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

2514
01:52:43.290 --> 01:52:43.990
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2515
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>

2516
01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 2>people always ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you</v>

2517
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.760
<v Speaker 3>do to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to caroline,</v>

2518
01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:48.080
<v Speaker 3>can I use your protocol?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2519
01:52:48.081 --> 01:52:49.580
<v Speaker 3>you won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people like,</v>

2520
01:52:49.581 --> 01:52:50.271
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2521
01:52:50.271 --> 01:52:52.370
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used action sports and flow states.</v>

2522
01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:53.923
<v Speaker 3>I took steroids and medical marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 3>and those were the three things that </v>

2523
01:52:57.590 --> 01:52:59.900
<v Speaker 3>really worked for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So steroids,</v>

2524
01:52:59.901 --> 01:53:03.410
<v Speaker 3>pot and action sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a party man.</v>

2525
01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:06.170
<v Speaker 3>Magic healing protocol for lyme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2526
01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:09.530
<v Speaker 3>so what other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it just the surfing or what other,</v>

2527
01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:11.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>action sports.</v>

2528
01:53:11.061 --> 01:53:14.330
<v Speaker 3>Did you engage in the put in the truck </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time it was mostly,</v>

2529
01:53:14.331 --> 01:53:16.550
<v Speaker 3>it was mostly surfing though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing,</v>

2530
01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:17.021
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2531
01:53:17.021 --> 01:53:17.854
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I was recovering after like the </v>

2532
01:53:19.821 --> 01:53:20.654
<v Speaker 3>surfing was what I was doing and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would knock me on my ass for a long </v>

2533
01:53:22.611 --> 01:53:24.650
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but after I started to get a little more</v>

2534
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:26.090
<v Speaker 3>physical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started,</v>

2535
01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:27.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2536
01:53:27.441 --> 01:53:28.274
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would do long hikes with my dog </v>

2537
01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:31.633
<v Speaker 3>through the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which to me will produce a low grade </v>

2538
01:53:33.201 --> 01:53:34.220
<v Speaker 3>flow state for sure.</v>

2539
01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:37.190
<v Speaker 3>Being out in nature obviously does that </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me a lot.</v>

2540
01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and being with being with my dog at that</v>

2541
01:53:39.621 --> 01:53:41.750
<v Speaker 3>time did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was that also,</v>

2542
01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:47.390
<v Speaker 3>once I got enough of my brain back and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>started writing at that point it was,</v>

2543
01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:49.370
<v Speaker 3>I was writing the west to Jesus when my </v>
<v Speaker 3>second book,</v>

2544
01:53:49.371 --> 01:53:51.050
<v Speaker 3>which was the book that sort of covered </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2545
01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:54.920
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of this stuff that started </v>
<v Speaker 3>producing massive amounts of flow.</v>

2546
01:53:54.921 --> 01:53:57.680
<v Speaker 3>One of the things about flow is the more</v>
<v Speaker 3>flow you have,</v>

2547
01:53:57.681 --> 01:53:58.514
<v Speaker 3>the more flow you haven't float will </v>
<v Speaker 3>cross domains if you end up with a lot </v>

2548
01:54:01.191 --> 01:54:03.830
<v Speaker 3>of flow while surfing or fighting or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2549
01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:08.330
<v Speaker 3>it'll start bleeding into your other </v>
<v Speaker 3>work because it's just a focusing skill,</v>

2550
01:54:08.331 --> 01:54:09.164
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's training the brain to focus in a </v>

2551
01:54:10.131 --> 01:54:13.970
<v Speaker 3>particular way and you can train it up </v>
<v Speaker 3>so the more flow you have,</v>

2552
01:54:13.971 --> 01:54:14.990
<v Speaker 3>the more flow you have.</v>

2553
01:54:15.290 --> 01:54:16.123
<v Speaker 3>So those used boots and performance that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start getting in surfing will start </v>

2554
01:54:18.351 --> 01:54:20.330
<v Speaker 3>bleeding into your writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And suddenly,</v>

2555
01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:21.353
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything in my life just started </v>

2556
01:54:22.161 --> 01:54:24.800
<v Speaker 3>clicking in the writing started </v>
<v Speaker 3>producing a lot of flow.</v>

2557
01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:25.853
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and eventually I started skiing has </v>

2558
01:54:30.111 --> 01:54:31.220
<v Speaker 3>always been my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2559
01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:32.113
<v Speaker 3>my core deep sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that it took a while till I was </v>

2560
01:54:35.151 --> 01:54:35.984
<v Speaker 3>strong enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a hell of a lot easier to ride a </v>

2561
01:54:37.630 --> 01:54:38.463
<v Speaker 3>long board in the waves and it is to try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go hurdling down a mountain on skis </v>

2562
01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:42.553
<v Speaker 3>really isn't for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was for me in terms of energy </v>

2563
01:54:44.481 --> 01:54:45.980
<v Speaker 3>expenditure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't speak for everybody else,</v>

2564
01:54:45.981 --> 01:54:47.120
<v Speaker 3>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2565
01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:48.163
<v Speaker 3>because I already knew how to surf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have to learn how to surf and </v>

2566
01:54:49.851 --> 01:54:51.920
<v Speaker 3>once you know how to surf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>riding a long board,</v>

2567
01:54:51.921 --> 01:54:54.880
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're writing super </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendly wave,</v>

2568
01:54:54.890 --> 01:54:56.870
<v Speaker 3>sunset or Malibu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>places like that.</v>

2569
01:54:57.230 --> 01:54:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Not</v>

2570
01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:00.590
<v Speaker 1>severely taxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never served,</v>

2571
01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:04.580
<v Speaker 1>but have always been compelled or just </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about it being on that</v>

2572
01:55:04.581 --> 01:55:06.980
<v Speaker 1>water and it's grieving and its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2573
01:55:06.981 --> 01:55:09.590
<v Speaker 1>but the whole monsters in the water </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2574
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:10.723
<v Speaker 1>I can't get over that to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how many people have this </v>

2575
01:55:14.061 --> 01:55:16.770
<v Speaker 1>phobia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is astounding how many people are.</v>

2576
01:55:16.771 --> 01:55:20.000
<v Speaker 1>We're afraid of sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think that comes from?</v>

2577
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:21.260
<v Speaker 1>The fucking sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2578
01:55:21.261 --> 01:55:23.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what it comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is millions of them.</v>

2579
01:55:23.811 --> 01:55:25.010
<v Speaker 1>They're out there fucking swimming </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

2580
01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:30.020
<v Speaker 1>You're getting hit by lightening are </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater than getting eaten by a shark.</v>

2581
01:55:30.381 --> 01:55:31.214
<v Speaker 1>Next time you say that to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to recognize that your </v>

2582
01:55:33.201 --> 01:55:35.480
<v Speaker 1>chances of getting eaten by a shark or </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

2583
01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:37.550
<v Speaker 1>if you don't go in the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

2584
01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:40.520
<v Speaker 1>zero percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will never fucking happened,</v>

2585
01:55:40.521 --> 01:55:42.770
<v Speaker 1>but that's one thing you never have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about.</v>

2586
01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Very few things</v>

2587
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:49.050
<v Speaker 2>on this planet that feel as good or as </v>
<v Speaker 2>uniquely good as surfing.</v>

2588
01:55:49.051 --> 01:55:53.250
<v Speaker 2>Believe you and you'll never get that </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience for an experience junkie such</v>

2589
01:55:53.251 --> 01:55:54.780
<v Speaker 2>as yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that,</v>

2590
01:55:54.781 --> 01:55:56.460
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're missing something.</v>

2591
01:55:56.910 --> 01:55:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be right,</v>

2592
01:55:58.411 --> 01:56:01.020
<v Speaker 2>but I ain't skydiving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a buddy of mine who's a fucking.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like looking over the edge of a cliff,</v>

2609
01:56:44.761 --> 01:56:48.630
<v Speaker 2>like from his perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he just slowly tips forward and</v>

2610
01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:51.300
<v Speaker 2>jumps off of it and starts flying.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to look at that man.</v>

2614
01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:00.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must be fun.</v>

2615
01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Must Be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2616
01:57:01.771 --> 01:57:02.604
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2617
01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:03.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dean Potter before it,</v>

2618
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:06.120
<v Speaker 2>before he died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a climber and a,</v>

2619
01:57:06.121 --> 01:57:08.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another wind suit guy and he,</v>

2620
01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:09.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he died.</v>

2621
01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:10.890
<v Speaker 2>See the guy that slammed into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bridge,</v>

2622
01:57:11.070 --> 01:57:12.150
<v Speaker 2>not the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2623
01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:15.360
<v Speaker 2>body slamming into a notch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a notch and rock.</v>

2624
01:57:15.361 --> 01:57:17.670
<v Speaker 2>And he was flying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a new cemetery.</v>

2625
01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:20.820
<v Speaker 2>He slammed into a cliff called lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>brother.</v>

2626
01:57:20.821 --> 01:57:25.590
<v Speaker 2>I want to say fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you going terminal velocity?</v>

2627
01:57:25.770 --> 01:57:28.740
<v Speaker 2>So 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>3,140</v>

2628
01:57:28.830 --> 01:57:32.310
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour is coming to holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wrong.</v>

2629
01:57:32.311 --> 01:57:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Why they call it terminal velocity </v>
<v Speaker 2>because everybody dies.</v>

2630
01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:38.490
<v Speaker 2>Is that what they call a terminal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That maximum that you can.</v>

2631
01:57:38.590 --> 01:57:40.470
<v Speaker 2>You can hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2632
01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:43.050
<v Speaker 2>if you're not a pair of Jean Falcon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2633
01:57:43.530 --> 01:57:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Is this handy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking crazy asshole.</v>

2634
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:46.583
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

2635
01:57:48.330 --> 01:57:50.370
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That must be fun though,</v>

2636
01:57:50.371 --> 01:57:51.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you that?</v>

2637
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've skydived before.</v>

2638
01:57:53.850 --> 01:57:56.550
<v Speaker 2>What'd you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hesitation.</v>

2639
01:57:57.330 --> 01:57:58.163
<v Speaker 2>The hesitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's only because I'm married and I </v>

2640
01:58:02.911 --> 01:58:07.040
<v Speaker 2>run a dog that like when I get cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hail,</v>

2641
01:58:07.041 --> 01:58:09.330
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't just cure it with flow state.</v>

2642
01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going to give that.</v>

2643
01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:14.940
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know that's a beaut flow trigger.</v>

2644
01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:15.953
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to flip one like crazy when </v>

2645
01:58:18.001 --> 01:58:20.430
<v Speaker 2>you're flying 18 miles and a squirrel </v>
<v Speaker 2>suit,</v>

2646
01:58:20.670 --> 01:58:24.410
<v Speaker 2>we now know there we think there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know of 20 flow triggers right there.</v>

2647
01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Probably would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there.</v>

2648
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:26.880
<v Speaker 2>Can you list them off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2649
01:58:26.881 --> 01:58:27.714
<v Speaker 2>but I can list off some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I could probably list them all </v>

2650
01:58:29.311 --> 01:58:30.320
<v Speaker 2>but it would give me a couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2651
01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:32.340
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but think about all these ones that.</v>

2652
01:58:32.410 --> 01:58:33.243
<v Speaker 2>So these are all things that grab hold </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your attention and sort of drive it </v>

2653
01:58:35.371 --> 01:58:35.700
<v Speaker 2>into the now.</v>

2654
01:58:35.700 --> 01:58:38.460
<v Speaker 2>So risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not just physical risk,</v>

2655
01:58:38.461 --> 01:58:40.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You emotional or a spiritual risk.</v>

2656
01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Arrests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social risk is phenomenal.</v>

2657
01:58:43.331 --> 01:58:44.164
<v Speaker 2>Your social risks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain can't tell the difference </v>

2658
01:58:46.151 --> 01:58:49.660
<v Speaker 2>between social fear and physical fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when people have unsafe sex,</v>

2659
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:52.030
<v Speaker 2>when they have sent some strangers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>flow state thing,</v>

2660
01:58:52.090 --> 01:58:54.490
<v Speaker 2>maybe flip some Weirdo at a bar and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

2661
01:58:54.491 --> 01:58:56.710
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take them back to your house,</v>

2662
01:58:56.711 --> 01:58:58.060
<v Speaker 2>you anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they know where you live.</v>

2663
01:58:58.061 --> 01:58:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know you.</v>

2664
01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:00.970
<v Speaker 2>I like how your role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2665
01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:02.530
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2666
01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:07.330
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a flow state.</v>

2667
01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:08.660
<v Speaker 2>It may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may be.</v>

2668
01:59:08.750 --> 01:59:09.583
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2669
01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I was just talking about this with </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody a couple days ago.</v>

2670
01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:12.933
<v Speaker 2>We haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously there's all kinds of </v>

2671
01:59:14.351 --> 01:59:17.350
<v Speaker 2>sexual flow triggers because obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex grabs hold of your attention.</v>

2672
01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:18.970
<v Speaker 2>We just haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't been looked at,</v>

2673
01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:22.810
<v Speaker 2>but novelty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>complexity,</v>

2674
01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:24.970
<v Speaker 2>unpredictability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a deep embodiment,</v>

2675
01:59:24.971 --> 01:59:27.700
<v Speaker 2>which is when you're paying attention to</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple sensory streams.</v>

2676
01:59:27.730 --> 01:59:28.950
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so not just like,</v>

2677
01:59:29.230 --> 01:59:30.063
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a head on a stick looking at a computer </v>

2678
01:59:31.121 --> 01:59:31.910
<v Speaker 2>screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

2679
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:34.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of learning through that way,</v>

2680
01:59:34.481 --> 01:59:37.750
<v Speaker 2>you're learning through doing so often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give you an example.</v>

2681
01:59:37.930 --> 01:59:38.763
<v Speaker 2>Montessori education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they went looking for nonsports </v>

2682
01:59:42.340 --> 01:59:44.590
<v Speaker 2>examples of really high flow </v>
<v Speaker 2>environments,</v>

2683
01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:47.440
<v Speaker 2>a Montessori education is very high on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the list.</v>

2684
01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2685
01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:50.493
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons is Montessori </v>
<v Speaker 2>education is often talked about is </v>

2686
01:59:53.110 --> 01:59:57.070
<v Speaker 2>embodied education and they emphasize </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning through doing.</v>

2687
01:59:57.071 --> 01:59:57.904
<v Speaker 2>So don't just read about the windmill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go out and build one when you're going </v>

2688
02:00:00.851 --> 02:00:01.684
<v Speaker 2>out and building one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're engaging multiple sensory </v>

2689
02:00:02.861 --> 02:00:04.450
<v Speaker 2>streams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're working with your hands,</v>

2690
02:00:04.451 --> 02:00:05.560
<v Speaker 2>working with your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>

2691
02:00:06.010 --> 02:00:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Drive attention into the now tends to </v>
<v Speaker 2>drive flow.</v>

2692
02:00:08.650 --> 02:00:09.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of like super successful and </v>

2693
02:00:10.331 --> 02:00:12.370
<v Speaker 2>creative people came from Montessori </v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

2694
02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:13.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a Wall Street Journal article </v>

2695
02:00:14.591 --> 02:00:15.424
<v Speaker 2>about the Montessori Mafia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all the ceos in Silicon Valley were </v>

2696
02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Montessori educated.</v>

2697
02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:22.233
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

2698
02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:25.150
<v Speaker 2>My friend went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took his son to Montessori,</v>

2699
02:00:25.151 --> 02:00:25.984
<v Speaker 2>but who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is my kid like who's six in school </v>

2700
02:00:28.781 --> 02:00:31.990
<v Speaker 2>with a bunch of 14 year olds?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all in the same class.</v>

2701
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:33.303
<v Speaker 2>He's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have different age kids all hang </v>

2702
02:00:35.861 --> 02:00:36.720
<v Speaker 2>out together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2703
02:00:36.730 --> 02:00:38.470
<v Speaker 2>because it's self directed learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2704
02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:42.280
<v Speaker 2>He didn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense.</v>

2705
02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:43.773
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense that,</v>

2706
02:00:44.050 --> 02:00:44.883
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that having all these </v>

2707
02:00:47.261 --> 02:00:48.820
<v Speaker 2>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>examples of,</v>

2708
02:00:48.850 --> 02:00:49.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2709
02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:52.000
<v Speaker 2>that's what a 16 year old girls like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2710
02:00:52.001 --> 02:00:55.360
<v Speaker 2>when you're six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what a 12 year old boys like,</v>

2711
02:00:55.390 --> 02:00:56.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the greatest.</v>

2712
02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:57.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

2713
02:00:57.250 --> 02:00:58.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about six,</v>

2714
02:00:58.391 --> 02:01:02.530
<v Speaker 2>but I was a 10 on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a magician.</v>

2715
02:01:02.590 --> 02:01:05.380
<v Speaker 2>That was my first job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was pressed to digitor.</v>

2716
02:01:05.381 --> 02:01:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I did birthday parties and misses and </v>

2719
02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2720
02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:15.700

<v Speaker 2>If I have lived a crazy life.</v>

2722
02:01:18.370 --> 02:01:21.310
<v Speaker 2>This guy was Arthur Benjamin who became </v>
<v Speaker 2>a mathematics genius.</v>

2723
02:01:21.311 --> 02:01:22.144
<v Speaker 2>He's the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a Ted famous Ted talk where he </v>

2724
02:01:23.531 --> 02:01:25.690
<v Speaker 2>squares numbers faster than calculators </v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>

2725
02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I knew him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was from Cleveland,</v>

02:01:37.961 --> 02:01:41.030
<v Speaker 2>So he gave me the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 11 or 12 at the time.</v>

2731
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:42.160
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2732
02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:44.510
<v Speaker 2>I was every weekend I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2733
02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:46.820
<v Speaker 2>and I was making a ton of cash for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an 11,</v>

2734
02:01:46.821 --> 02:01:47.654
<v Speaker 2>12 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was making 40 bucks a day for doing </v>

2735
02:01:49.011 --> 02:01:51.320
<v Speaker 2>like three birthday parties on Saturday </v>
<v Speaker 2>and three on Sunday.</v>

2736
02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:52.633
<v Speaker 2>Tiny money for her kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I bought a car in cash when I </v>

2737
02:01:54.411 --> 02:01:58.280
<v Speaker 2>was 16 with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they bought a bunch of it,</v>

2738
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:59.143
<v Speaker 2>the most obnoxious thing of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 16 year old kid walking in with a </v>

2739
02:02:01.671 --> 02:02:02.504
<v Speaker 2>big role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know how we got in to the </v>

2740
02:02:05.601 --> 02:02:07.190
<v Speaker 2>magic word restart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2741
02:02:08.090 --> 02:02:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Close date risks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we get the Magicians Jamie?</v>

2742
02:02:13.670 --> 02:02:15.060
<v Speaker 2>First job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

2743
02:02:15.450 --> 02:02:18.560
<v Speaker 2>we're still not getting back there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2744
02:02:18.561 --> 02:02:19.394
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So interesting tidbit about Steven that </v>

2745
02:02:20.661 --> 02:02:23.570
<v Speaker 2>not many people now now they do to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll call it,</v>

2746
02:02:23.571 --> 02:02:24.404
<v Speaker 2>that we're discussing is all the various</v>
<v Speaker 2>flow triggers and we're talking about </v>

2747
02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:28.940
<v Speaker 2>unsafe sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what it is.</v>

2748
02:02:28.941 --> 02:02:30.230
<v Speaker 2>You're having unsafe sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>

2749
02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:32.780
<v Speaker 2>He wrote lots of lots of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to leave that one alone.</v>

2750
02:02:32.790 --> 02:02:33.623
<v Speaker 2>Those other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going there with you pulling </v>

2751
02:02:35.631 --> 02:02:40.631
<v Speaker 2>rabbits out of your hat and found me </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2752
02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:46.790
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you document all these years,</v>

2753
02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:48.360
<v Speaker 4>various flow states,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2754
02:02:48.361 --> 02:02:50.010
<v Speaker 4>whether they're social flow state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2755
02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:51.750
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is or triggers rather social</v>

2756
02:02:51.751 --> 02:02:54.510
<v Speaker 4>triggers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>environmental danger,</v>

2757
02:02:54.511 --> 02:02:55.344
<v Speaker 4>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were talking about a bunch of </v>

2758
02:02:57.151 --> 02:03:01.710
<v Speaker 4>different stimuli that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously.</v>

2759
02:03:01.711 --> 02:03:05.790
<v Speaker 4>You were talking about not just one form</v>
<v Speaker 4>of information coming at you,</v>

2760
02:03:05.791 --> 02:03:07.950
<v Speaker 4>but several.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's when he started talking about</v>

2761
02:03:08.190 --> 02:03:10.290
<v Speaker 4>the being a magician,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't it?</v>

2762
02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:11.693
<v Speaker 4>Am I?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2763
02:03:12.190 --> 02:03:13.770
<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think so.</v>

2764
02:03:13.950 --> 02:03:14.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was it.</v>

2765
02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2766
02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:17.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be able to rewind it </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

2767
02:03:17.630 --> 02:03:19.130
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter to magic.</v>

2768
02:03:19.150 --> 02:03:19.983
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>

2769
02:03:20.210 --> 02:03:25.010
<v Speaker 4>There's all these different factors and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all these different forms of stimulation</v>

2770
02:03:25.340 --> 02:03:29.960
<v Speaker 4>that can sort of trigger this optimal </v>
<v Speaker 4>state,</v>

2771
02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:34.130
<v Speaker 4>its optimal state of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you've sort of documented cities and</v>

2772
02:03:34.131 --> 02:03:37.670
<v Speaker 4>studied these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what is your take out of it?</v>

2773
02:03:37.671 --> 02:03:38.640
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2774
02:03:38.750 --> 02:03:39.583
<v Speaker 4>what is like when you step back and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the book you wrote and you look </v>

2775
02:03:43.701 --> 02:03:44.534
<v Speaker 4>at all the research that you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at all the talks you've given </v>

2776
02:03:46.371 --> 02:03:48.050
<v Speaker 4>and all the conversations that you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>had about it.</v>

2777
02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:49.213
<v Speaker 4>What can you impart on people that would</v>
<v Speaker 4>allow them to sort of be able to absorb </v>

2778
02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:58.040
<v Speaker 4>some of this into their life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>

2779
02:03:58.610 --> 02:03:59.443
<v Speaker 4>Meaning what can average people do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What can the average person do to sort </v>

2780
02:04:01.941 --> 02:04:04.910
<v Speaker 4>of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like most things require a step.</v>

2781
02:04:05.330 --> 02:04:06.163
<v Speaker 4>Most things require like a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>dipping your toe into the water as it </v>

2782
02:04:09.201 --> 02:04:10.034
<v Speaker 4>were to sort of get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get stimulated or get excited about </v>

2783
02:04:13.671 --> 02:04:14.504
<v Speaker 4>doing something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think like the average </v>

2784
02:04:16.011 --> 02:04:21.011
<v Speaker 4>person should do just to try to feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>what a flow state could be?</v>

2785
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:23.510
<v Speaker 4>Is there any one thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2786
02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:24.950
<v Speaker 4>that's an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of a.</v>

2787
02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:26.390
<v Speaker 4>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a great question.</v>

2788
02:04:26.391 --> 02:04:28.160
<v Speaker 4>I think there's lots of stuff.</v>

2789
02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:31.473
<v Speaker 4>How do you.</v>

2790
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:36.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean yoga is a pretty good one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2791
02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of,</v>

2792
02:04:37.050 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people can</v>

2793
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:41.460
<v Speaker 3>use yoga as a great kind of gateway into</v>
<v Speaker 3>flow.</v>

2794
02:04:41.461 --> 02:04:44.040
<v Speaker 3>It's really easy because it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it combines,</v>

2795
02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:45.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of,</v>

2796
02:04:45.031 --> 02:04:48.420
<v Speaker 3>like we'll do really simple things when </v>
<v Speaker 3>we start working with people.</v>

2797
02:04:48.421 --> 02:04:51.450
<v Speaker 3>Like if we're working in a corporate </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>

2798
02:04:51.451 --> 02:04:52.440
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2799
02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:53.333
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mckinsey did a 10 year study and they </v>

2800
02:04:54.301 --> 02:04:55.134
<v Speaker 3>found that top executives in flow are </v>
<v Speaker 3>five times more productive than out of </v>

2801
02:04:58.561 --> 02:05:00.030
<v Speaker 3>flow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's 500 percent more.</v>

2802
02:05:00.590 --> 02:05:02.690
<v Speaker 3>How do they decide that you're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Florida?</v>

2803
02:05:03.150 --> 02:05:04.410
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was a survey.</v>

2804
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:05.303
<v Speaker 3>They surveyed thousands of top </v>
<v Speaker 3>executives and just ask them how much </v>

2805
02:05:08.311 --> 02:05:10.200
<v Speaker 3>more productive are you in flow?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2806
02:05:10.350 --> 02:05:11.183
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are psychological questionnaires </v>

2807
02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:15.050
<v Speaker 3>is kind of a sampling bias there though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the people that are successful,</v>

2808
02:05:15.051 --> 02:05:15.291
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2809
02:05:15.291 --> 02:05:16.124
<v Speaker 3>it was flowing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

2810
02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:18.660
<v Speaker 3>It might be you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be right about that.</v>

2811
02:05:18.661 --> 02:05:20.970
<v Speaker 3>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't dug deep enough into that.</v>

2812
02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:23.010
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2813
02:05:23.011 --> 02:05:24.150
<v Speaker 3>So this may be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>

2814
02:05:24.170 --> 02:05:25.230
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2815
02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:26.633
<v Speaker 3>That said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first thing we do when we start working </v>

2816
02:05:29.671 --> 02:05:33.740
<v Speaker 3>with corporations is tell people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't turn off your cellphone.</v>

2817
02:05:33.810 --> 02:05:35.080
<v Speaker 3>Turn off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he like flower quarters,</v>

2818
02:05:35.081 --> 02:05:36.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No concentration.</v>

2819
02:05:36.431 --> 02:05:39.030
<v Speaker 3>So shut everything off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2820
02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:40.770
<v Speaker 3>have you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can't,</v>

2821
02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:42.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>

2822
02:05:42.481 --> 02:05:45.450
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to sort of tack flow onto your</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2823
02:05:45.451 --> 02:05:47.850
<v Speaker 3>You sort of got to put it the center of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you do.</v>

2824
02:05:48.210 --> 02:05:50.940
<v Speaker 3>And for most people that seems like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>state is,</v>

2825
02:05:50.941 --> 02:05:53.370
<v Speaker 3>there's so much creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much motivation,</v>

2826
02:05:53.371 --> 02:05:55.050
<v Speaker 3>there's learning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>accelerates,</v>

2827
02:05:55.051 --> 02:05:57.350
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff to the upside is,</v>

2828
02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:58.353
<v Speaker 3>is worth it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people will start to build their </v>

2829
02:05:59.311 --> 02:06:01.590
<v Speaker 3>lives around the state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2830
02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:02.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

2831
02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:05.310
<v Speaker 3>Yoga is a pretty easy way in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it,</v>

2832
02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:08.310
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>taste it that way.</v>

2833
02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:09.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2834
02:06:09.541 --> 02:06:10.660
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in,</v>

2835
02:06:10.670 --> 02:06:11.503
<v Speaker 3>in stealing fire in my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my next book and the book that comes </v>

2836
02:06:13.111 --> 02:06:15.720
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is it about worry word stealing</v>

2837
02:06:15.721 --> 02:06:19.860
<v Speaker 3>fire is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bout a $4,000,000,000,000</v>

2838
02:06:19.950 --> 02:06:24.950
<v Speaker 3>underground revolution in altered states</v>
<v Speaker 3>of consciousness that is,</v>

2839
02:06:25.330 --> 02:06:26.163
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>involves kind of the top performance </v>

2840
02:06:27.811 --> 02:06:30.540
<v Speaker 3>from pretty much every domain and no </v>
<v Speaker 3>one's talking about it.</v>

2841
02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:33.930
<v Speaker 3>And yet if you know where to look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's everywhere you look.</v>

2842
02:06:34.350 --> 02:06:35.183
<v Speaker 3>So it's a book about a revolution and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people utilizing altered states of </v>

2843
02:06:37.831 --> 02:06:38.664
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm to massively drive performance and </v>

2844
02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:45.600
<v Speaker 3>across all different kinds of altered </v>
<v Speaker 3>states.</v>

2845
02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:48.330
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did that piece of shit crash again?</v>

2846
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:52.700
<v Speaker 1>How dare you try castor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever the fuck is making the tricaster</v>

2847
02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:56.690
<v Speaker 1>you fucking mutts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your machine sucks.</v>

2848
02:06:56.810 --> 02:06:59.330
<v Speaker 1>What is it goes down every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the video switcher.</v>

2849
02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:02.030
<v Speaker 1>So now we're still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're still recording,</v>

2850
02:07:02.060 --> 02:07:02.893
<v Speaker 1>but the audio version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie will have to splice the audio </v>

2851
02:07:04.911 --> 02:07:05.744
<v Speaker 1>recording into the video recording now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to have to a yell at </v>

2852
02:07:10.581 --> 02:07:11.414
<v Speaker 1>these tricaster people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has been happening on a regular </v>

2853
02:07:13.011 --> 02:07:13.844
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2854
02:07:15.230 --> 02:07:16.063
<v Speaker 1>Only the best thing you can buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only the best fucking piece of </v>

2855
02:07:18.111 --> 02:07:21.230
<v Speaker 1>equipment you could buy anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

2856
02:07:21.590 --> 02:07:22.470
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2857
02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:25.070
<v Speaker 1>altered states of consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>research,</v>

2858
02:07:25.071 --> 02:07:27.440
<v Speaker 1>like what are they concentrating on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the different,</v>

2859
02:07:27.441 --> 02:07:29.720
<v Speaker 1>various altered states of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what</v>

2860
02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:35.750
<v Speaker 3>one of the interesting things is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we talk about this in stealing fire,</v>

2861
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:40.720
<v Speaker 3>is a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We use the term Iq status.</v>

2862
02:07:40.860 --> 02:07:44.470
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a Greek term and it's what ecstatic</v>

2863
02:07:44.471 --> 02:07:45.960
<v Speaker 3>comes from ecstasy from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

2864
02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:48.940
<v Speaker 3>But it originally means if you go back </v>
<v Speaker 3>to Plato,</v>

2865
02:07:48.941 --> 02:07:52.810
<v Speaker 3>it means estate beyond your normal sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>of self,</v>

2866
02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:56.440
<v Speaker 3>where you tend to be filled with </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and inspiration or intuition</v>

2867
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:59.320
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was the classic Greek definition</v>

2868
02:07:59.321 --> 02:08:00.154
<v Speaker 3>of extensive if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we are interested in those altered </v>

2869
02:08:03.611 --> 02:08:04.444
<v Speaker 3>states that tend to produce this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this particular experience and that's </v>

2870
02:08:06.941 --> 02:08:10.840
<v Speaker 3>everything from contemplated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mystical states flow states of,</v>

2871
02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:15.350
<v Speaker 3>of all kinds of psychedelic states fall </v>
<v Speaker 3>into this category as well in the.</v>

2872
02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:16.233
<v Speaker 3>I mean the interesting thing is we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been talking a lot about the </v>

2873
02:08:18.101 --> 02:08:19.360
<v Speaker 3>neurobiology of flow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2874
02:08:19.361 --> 02:08:21.820
<v Speaker 3>What goes on under the hood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the interesting thing,</v>

2875
02:08:21.821 --> 02:08:24.070
<v Speaker 3>and this is what sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go back 100 years,</v>

2876
02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:25.233
<v Speaker 3>William James,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who kind of early Harvard psychologists </v>

2877
02:08:27.610 --> 02:08:29.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bought,</v>

2878
02:08:29.530 --> 02:08:30.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flow states,</v>

2879
02:08:30.371 --> 02:08:32.860
<v Speaker 3>mystical experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>contemplate of experiences,</v>

2880
02:08:32.890 --> 02:08:34.100
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experiences.</v>

2881
02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:35.770
<v Speaker 3>He thought they were all the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2882
02:08:35.890 --> 02:08:39.070
<v Speaker 3>They weren't split apart over the course</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the past hundred years.</v>

2883
02:08:39.580 --> 02:08:40.413
<v Speaker 3>We split those things apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's happening now is we can look </v>

2884
02:08:44.081 --> 02:08:48.340
<v Speaker 3>under the hood and when you look under </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hood and you look at flow versus say</v>

2885
02:08:48.610 --> 02:08:51.910
<v Speaker 3>a near death experiences versus a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic state,</v>

2886
02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:54.190
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very similar things are happening in the</v>

2887
02:08:54.191 --> 02:08:57.610
<v Speaker 3>brain in all these states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prefrontal Cortex,</v>

2888
02:08:57.820 --> 02:09:00.370
<v Speaker 3>parts of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or deactivating and get the same five or</v>

2889
02:09:00.371 --> 02:09:01.204
<v Speaker 3>six neurochemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have brainwave moving towards Alpha </v>

2890
02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:04.570
<v Speaker 3>Theta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all very similar.</v>

2891
02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:07.870
<v Speaker 3>They may get you there in different ways</v>
<v Speaker 3>like psychedelics,</v>

2892
02:09:07.871 --> 02:09:10.110
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a inflow.</v>

2893
02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:12.130
<v Speaker 3>It's an efficiency exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2894
02:09:12.131 --> 02:09:17.080
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is we trade and our </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain has a fixed energy budget.</v>

2895
02:09:17.081 --> 02:09:18.430
<v Speaker 3>It's an energy hog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2896
02:09:18.431 --> 02:09:22.270
<v Speaker 3>Uses about 25 percent of your energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet two percent of your mass,</v>

2897
02:09:22.271 --> 02:09:23.620
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>25 percent of your energy.</v>

2898
02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:24.663
<v Speaker 3>It's got a fixed energy budget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happens in flow is we allocate </v>

2899
02:09:28.331 --> 02:09:30.910
<v Speaker 3>more and more energy for focus and </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention,</v>

2900
02:09:31.150 --> 02:09:34.690
<v Speaker 3>and then the brain starts shutting down </v>
<v Speaker 3>noncritical structures,</v>

2901
02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:35.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens.</v>

2902
02:09:35.861 --> 02:09:37.690
<v Speaker 3>That's why your sense of self </v>
<v Speaker 3>disappears.</v>

2903
02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:40.630
<v Speaker 3>That's why time passes strangely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that efficiency exchange.</v>

2904
02:09:40.930 --> 02:09:44.500
<v Speaker 3>Psychedelics also downregulate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prefrontal cortex.</v>

2905
02:09:44.650 --> 02:09:46.360
<v Speaker 3>They do it by overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2906
02:09:46.361 --> 02:09:50.920
<v Speaker 3>They let in so much stimuli that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>no longer process it with your conscious</v>

2907
02:09:50.921 --> 02:09:51.754
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sort of kicks things over to the </v>

2908
02:09:52.301 --> 02:09:55.390
<v Speaker 3>subconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the end result is the same.</v>

2909
02:09:55.391 --> 02:09:58.060
<v Speaker 3>You get this sense of selflessness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>timelessness,</v>

2910
02:09:58.180 --> 02:10:01.900
<v Speaker 3>effortlessness and information richness </v>
<v Speaker 3>that shows up in all these states.</v>

2911
02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:04.480
<v Speaker 3>All these states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have different names,</v>

2912
02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:07.570
<v Speaker 3>but you look under the hood and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurobiology is the same.</v>

2913
02:10:07.571 --> 02:10:10.960
<v Speaker 3>And the experience like how we feel in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the estates,</v>

2914
02:10:11.230 --> 02:10:12.063
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we feel like our sense of self has </v>

2915
02:10:13.091 --> 02:10:13.480
<v Speaker 3>disappeared.</v>

2916
02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:16.600
<v Speaker 3>We feel like time is passing strangely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There all effortless effort.</v>

2917
02:10:16.601 --> 02:10:18.100
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're in flow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every decision,</v>

2918
02:10:18.101 --> 02:10:20.410
<v Speaker 3>every action follows seamlessly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fluidly,</v>

2919
02:10:20.411 --> 02:10:23.170
<v Speaker 3>perfectly from the next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of the definition of flow.</v>

2920
02:10:23.470 --> 02:10:26.560
<v Speaker 3>And they're all information rich states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we tend to think.</v>

2921
02:10:26.561 --> 02:10:28.690
<v Speaker 3>I tend to think about these things I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying we,</v>

2922
02:10:28.691 --> 02:10:30.910
<v Speaker 3>because I co wrote this book with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>partner Jamie Wheal,</v>

2923
02:10:30.911 --> 02:10:32.490
<v Speaker 3>who I started the flow genome project </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

2924
02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:33.573
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tend to think of all these states is </v>

2925
02:10:34.681 --> 02:10:35.514
<v Speaker 3>sort of like big data for the mind to </v>
<v Speaker 3>access to a much more information </v>

2926
02:10:38.451 --> 02:10:39.284
<v Speaker 3>inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they seem to be all the same </v>

2927
02:10:40.731 --> 02:10:41.564
<v Speaker 3>experience under the hood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what this means is why is this giant </v>

2928
02:10:45.081 --> 02:10:45.914
<v Speaker 3>revolution will cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all these different subcultures </v>

2929
02:10:48.050 --> 02:10:49.580
<v Speaker 3>that are doing different things and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

2930
02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:50.593
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get the same effects </v>

2931
02:10:51.081 --> 02:10:53.600
<v Speaker 3>technologically transcranial </v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulation.</v>

2932
02:10:53.601 --> 02:10:54.180
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2933
02:10:54.180 --> 02:10:57.920
<v Speaker 3>you can use weak magnetic pulses to </v>
<v Speaker 3>knock out the prefrontal cortex.</v>

2934
02:10:58.280 --> 02:10:59.640
<v Speaker 3>And they're now doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like,</v>

2935
02:10:59.650 --> 02:11:01.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're following this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

2936
02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:02.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2937
02:11:02.181 --> 02:11:04.030
<v Speaker 3>in stealing fire we did a lot of work </v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

2938
02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:05.113
<v Speaker 3>with the Navy seals and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you dig under the hood with seal </v>

2939
02:11:08.661 --> 02:11:09.890
<v Speaker 3>training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll tell you that,</v>

2940
02:11:10.190 --> 02:11:11.023
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously there's levels of physical </v>

2941
02:11:12.471 --> 02:11:15.320
<v Speaker 3>skills and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tactical sales that you have to have.</v>

2942
02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:16.393
<v Speaker 3>But most everything else that we think </v>
<v Speaker 3>of as seal training is a giant group </v>

2943
02:11:19.341 --> 02:11:21.830
<v Speaker 3>flow filtration system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they can get,</v>

2944
02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:22.753
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the screening for people who can drop </v>

2945
02:11:24.291 --> 02:11:27.440
<v Speaker 3>into glue group flow together at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>click of a hat.</v>

2946
02:11:27.441 --> 02:11:29.930
<v Speaker 3>Because it's how you work best work at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>team,</v>

2947
02:11:31.990 --> 02:11:32.823
<v Speaker 3>you see the same kind of things across </v>
<v Speaker 3>the boards and all of these high </v>

2948
02:11:35.451 --> 02:11:36.284
<v Speaker 3>performing groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the seals don't think of themselves </v>

2949
02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:40.340
<v Speaker 3>in the same way that the yoga moms think</v>
<v Speaker 3>of themselves.</v>

2950
02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:42.890
<v Speaker 3>They would never say we're doing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing,</v>

2951
02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:43.993
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hippies and Ravers who were taken </v>

2952
02:11:46.241 --> 02:11:47.074
<v Speaker 3>acts or drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would never think that these people </v>

2953
02:11:49.101 --> 02:11:49.934
<v Speaker 3>are involved in the same revolution they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were in this world than say moon is </v>

2954
02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:53.713
<v Speaker 3>absolutely the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're seeking the same ability to </v>

2955
02:11:56.241 --> 02:11:57.074
<v Speaker 3>change the channel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason is there are certain </v>

2956
02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:03.800
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote skills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty first century skills,</v>

2957
02:12:03.801 --> 02:12:05.530
<v Speaker 3>whether it's healing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive trauma,</v>

2958
02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:06.910
<v Speaker 3>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2959
02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:08.143
<v Speaker 3>or creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cooperation in these kinds of things </v>

2960
02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:11.323
<v Speaker 3>were the way we've been built from an </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary standpoint to optimize </v>

2961
02:12:14.511 --> 02:12:15.344
<v Speaker 3>those things is through altered states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is through changing the channel and </v>

2962
02:12:17.841 --> 02:12:20.300
<v Speaker 3>utilizing non ordinary states of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

2963
02:12:20.301 --> 02:12:24.030
<v Speaker 3>So the book is about getting the giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution that's going on with this and</v>

2964
02:12:24.070 --> 02:12:24.903
<v Speaker 3>kind of four emerging forces that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>driving this forward and making it go </v>

2965
02:12:28.881 --> 02:12:29.714
<v Speaker 3>faster and wider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you concentrated on holotropic </v>

2966
02:12:32.271 --> 02:12:34.520
<v Speaker 3>breathing or meditation practices?</v>

2967
02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:37.100
<v Speaker 3>Are Kundalini or any of those things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We focus on.</v>

2968
02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:37.953
<v Speaker 3>We looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we looked at all that stuff and </v>

2969
02:12:39.081 --> 02:12:40.670
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2970
02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:41.743
<v Speaker 3>respiration breathing stuff is easiest </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible way in the world that change </v>

2971
02:12:46.071 --> 02:12:47.360
<v Speaker 3>your consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2972
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:49.550
<v Speaker 3>And I mean in everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2973
02:12:49.610 --> 02:12:53.690
<v Speaker 3>whether it's on the vm off side with his</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of crazy version of,</v>

2974
02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:54.770
<v Speaker 3>of breath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of fire,</v>

2975
02:12:54.771 --> 02:12:57.200
<v Speaker 3>which has a long history in yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2976
02:12:57.350 --> 02:12:58.183
<v Speaker 3>everybody sort or whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what Laird Hamilton and Brian </v>

2977
02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:02.200
<v Speaker 3>Mackenzie are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2978
02:13:02.260 --> 02:13:04.040
<v Speaker 3>what are they doing on the pool </v>
<v Speaker 3>training?</v>

2979
02:13:04.370 --> 02:13:06.740
<v Speaker 3>They're just a different version they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>using.</v>

2980
02:13:06.741 --> 02:13:07.574
<v Speaker 3>It's different versions of apnea </v>
<v Speaker 3>training where they're using various </v>

2981
02:13:10.281 --> 02:13:14.830
<v Speaker 3>breath holds and things along those </v>
<v Speaker 3>lines to alter consciousness in abet.</v>

2982
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:18.050
<v Speaker 3>Performance seems to be kind of going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>across the boards everywhere.</v>

2983
02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:19.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the respiration stuff,</v>

2984
02:13:19.730 --> 02:13:20.563
<v Speaker 3>Hixon Gracie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's probably the greatest Jujitsu </v>

2985
02:13:23.481 --> 02:13:26.150
<v Speaker 3>practitioner of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least he certainly wasn't his era,</v>

2986
02:13:26.210 --> 02:13:28.550
<v Speaker 3>recognized by everyone as being the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best,</v>

2987
02:13:28.551 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 3>was a massive yoga practitioner who is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yogi and one</v>

2988
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:32.873
<v Speaker 1>of the things that he was really deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply invested in his breath work and </v>

2989
02:13:36.571 --> 02:13:37.404
<v Speaker 1>he would do that crazy shit where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucks his stomach up deep into his rib </v>

2990
02:13:40.441 --> 02:13:41.610
<v Speaker 1>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen,</v>

2991
02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:43.860
<v Speaker 1>I know extent do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he does it,</v>

2992
02:13:43.861 --> 02:13:44.694
<v Speaker 1>it's super bizarre because he's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing control so his stomach is like </v>

2993
02:13:47.491 --> 02:13:51.210
<v Speaker 1>going in and also the people say it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the secret.</v>

2994
02:13:51.211 --> 02:13:54.600
<v Speaker 1>If you want the lower kind of add band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn to suck it in.</v>

2995
02:13:54.601 --> 02:13:55.434
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never really played with lots of </v>

2996
02:13:56.700 --> 02:13:57.533
<v Speaker 1>static.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is aesthetic thing he's not </v>

2997
02:14:00.841 --> 02:14:03.960
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's trying to do is achieve this</v>

2998
02:14:03.961 --> 02:14:04.794
<v Speaker 1>complete control of the breath for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in Jujitsu that's really important </v>

2999
02:14:08.551 --> 02:14:11.800
<v Speaker 1>because there's many times where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>locked up on something and you're,</v>

3000
02:14:11.801 --> 02:14:14.400
<v Speaker 1>you're panicking and when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>panicking,</v>

3001
02:14:14.401 --> 02:14:15.234
<v Speaker 1>you're heartbeats too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need more oxygen and you can't </v>

3002
02:14:17.821 --> 02:14:18.654
<v Speaker 1>breathe and you freak out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ability to stay calm and </v>

3003
02:14:20.881 --> 02:14:23.760
<v Speaker 1>controlled is directly related to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to control your breathing.</v>

3004
02:14:23.790 --> 02:14:27.240
<v Speaker 1>One of the first things you know we </v>
<v Speaker 1>train people to do is,</v>

3005
02:14:27.510 --> 02:14:30.570
<v Speaker 1>so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your exhale is about seven seconds or</v>

3006
02:14:30.571 --> 02:14:31.800
<v Speaker 1>longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably know this.</v>

3007
02:14:32.220 --> 02:14:35.340
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a fight or flight </v>
<v Speaker 1>response because your brain goes,</v>

3008
02:14:35.610 --> 02:14:36.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this long,</v>

3009
02:14:36.751 --> 02:14:41.160
<v Speaker 1>luxurious exhale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must be calm so you won't panic.</v>

3010
02:14:41.490 --> 02:14:42.480
<v Speaker 1>So one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3011
02:14:42.481 --> 02:14:45.710
<v Speaker 1>with when working with action sport </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes or people you know,</v>

3012
02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:47.040
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could do with fighters as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3013
02:14:47.041 --> 02:14:47.874
<v Speaker 1>we've done it with some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the special forces guys just </v>

3014
02:14:50.491 --> 02:14:51.324
<v Speaker 1>really slowing down the breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exhale a little bit in most </v>

3015
02:14:54.601 --> 02:14:56.970
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably couldn't do it mid fight,</v>

3016
02:14:57.420 --> 02:14:59.640
<v Speaker 1>probably certain sports situation can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

3017
02:14:59.850 --> 02:15:00.683
<v Speaker 1>but you can always usually get like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>three second inhale and a seven second </v>

3018
02:15:03.901 --> 02:15:07.330
<v Speaker 1>exhale and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do about three of those and you will</v>

3019
02:15:07.770 --> 02:15:10.740
<v Speaker 1>really calm down your central nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>system really quickly.</v>

3020
02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:12.293
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing that happens in a </v>

3021
02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:17.990
<v Speaker 1>bowhunting they called target panic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the dealing,</v>

3022
02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:21.450
<v Speaker 1>the difference between a closed loop </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and an open loop system,</v>

3023
02:15:21.810 --> 02:15:22.643
<v Speaker 1>meaning when you are in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something and you're when you're </v>

3024
02:15:28.260 --> 02:15:29.093
<v Speaker 1>drawing back on an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you panic and you just slam the trigger </v>

3025
02:15:31.651 --> 02:15:33.590
<v Speaker 1>and you freak out and your emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3026
02:15:33.591 --> 02:15:36.210
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your anxiety gets carried away with you,</v>

3027
02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:37.313
<v Speaker 1>but if you follow a certain protocol and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to all your movements and </v>

3028
02:15:41.641 --> 02:15:46.090
<v Speaker 1>have everything in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your concentration on your movement</v>

3029
02:15:46.091 --> 02:15:46.924
<v Speaker 1>sort of overtakes your anxiety and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the issues that you would have and it </v>

3030
02:15:50.611 --> 02:15:51.444
<v Speaker 1>allows you to carry through with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing in this very </v>

3031
02:15:54.841 --> 02:15:58.170
<v Speaker 1>intense and sort of like pressure field </v>
<v Speaker 1>filled situation.</v>

3032
02:15:58.420 --> 02:15:59.850
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did it go down again?</v>

3033
02:16:00.550 --> 02:16:03.610
<v Speaker 1>It's completely acting way up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even look.</v>

3034
02:16:03.630 --> 02:16:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Click on anything right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to reset it five times so.</v>

3035
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:08.183
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we'll splice in the audio to the </v>

3036
02:16:09.331 --> 02:16:11.940
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fucking piece of shit.</v>

3037
02:16:12.410 --> 02:16:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you guys went,</v>

3038
02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:17.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on these different altered</v>

3039
02:16:17.161 --> 02:16:20.880
<v Speaker 1>states of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have like a hierarchy of them?</v>

3040
02:16:20.881 --> 02:16:21.541
<v Speaker 1>Do you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3041
02:16:21.541 --> 02:16:22.374
<v Speaker 1>examine all of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are some of them more beneficial than </v>

3042
02:16:24.061 --> 02:16:25.460
<v Speaker 1>others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me get it.</v>

3043
02:16:25.461 --> 02:16:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Let's get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about,</v>

3044
02:16:26.331 --> 02:16:28.650
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at trauma for example.</v>

3045
02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:29.513
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what</v>

3046
02:16:30.730 --> 02:16:33.220
<v Speaker 3>they all seem to do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's timescale.</v>

3047
02:16:33.221 --> 02:16:34.054
<v Speaker 3>So we know Michael Mithoefer hoffer's </v>
<v Speaker 3>work used mgma for to treat ptsd in </v>

3048
02:16:39.221 --> 02:16:40.054
<v Speaker 3>victims of child abuse and sexual abuse </v>
<v Speaker 3>and trauma from the wars in Iraq and </v>

3049
02:16:45.881 --> 02:16:46.541
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3050
02:16:46.541 --> 02:16:47.374
<v Speaker 3>This is the work that went down in South</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carolina that lead right there was the </v>

3051
02:16:51.370 --> 02:16:52.930
<v Speaker 3>foundational work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what they discovered,</v>

3052
02:16:52.931 --> 02:16:53.764
<v Speaker 3>what he's discovered is one to three </v>
<v Speaker 3>sessions with Mtma therapy is enough to </v>

3053
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:05.980
<v Speaker 3>significantly reduce or completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>remove ptsd symptoms.</v>

3054
02:17:05.981 --> 02:17:08.080
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they've done a lot of this.</v>

3055
02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:09.333
<v Speaker 3>So they redid that at Camp Pendleton </v>
<v Speaker 3>with about a thousand soldiers and </v>

3056
02:17:13.751 --> 02:17:16.960
<v Speaker 3>instead of Mtma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they replaced it with flow.</v>

3057
02:17:16.961 --> 02:17:20.650
<v Speaker 3>They used surfing as a flow trigger and </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk therapy.</v>

3058
02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:22.930
<v Speaker 3>And they've done this with about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand soldiers this,</v>

3059
02:17:22.980 --> 02:17:24.190
<v Speaker 3>this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

3060
02:17:24.191 --> 02:17:25.840
<v Speaker 3>And they're getting the same end </v>
<v Speaker 3>results,</v>

3061
02:17:25.841 --> 02:17:29.290
<v Speaker 3>but it takes about five weeks of surfing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and talk therapy.</v>

3062
02:17:29.291 --> 02:17:34.270
<v Speaker 3>So the MTMA get to these results in </v>
<v Speaker 3>about one to three sessions,</v>

3063
02:17:34.271 --> 02:17:37.780
<v Speaker 3>so three days tops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five weeks with the surfing,</v>

3064
02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:40.150
<v Speaker 3>with the surfing and talk therapy.</v>

3065
02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:40.983
<v Speaker 3>And then they redid it again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different different scientists with </v>

3066
02:17:43.121 --> 02:17:48.121
<v Speaker 3>meditation and it takes about 12 weeks </v>
<v Speaker 3>with meditation and they can't get it.</v>

3067
02:17:48.700 --> 02:17:49.533
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they've gotten a total </v>
<v Speaker 3>reduction of ptsd symptoms with </v>

3068
02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:55.990
<v Speaker 3>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for sure people's with meds drop.</v>

3069
02:17:56.170 --> 02:18:00.010
<v Speaker 3>So it's the same sort of result,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different timescales.</v>

3070
02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:01.053
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's the interventions are doing the </v>

3071
02:18:02.681 --> 02:18:05.360
<v Speaker 3>same thing inside the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3072
02:18:05.390 --> 02:18:09.250
<v Speaker 3>The same thing as sort of happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a question and it's really how much</v>

3073
02:18:09.251 --> 02:18:10.084
<v Speaker 3>risk you want to take Mtma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you got to put an amphetamine into </v>

3074
02:18:12.251 --> 02:18:15.190
<v Speaker 3>your system surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a little bit of risk out there.</v>

3075
02:18:15.191 --> 02:18:17.830
<v Speaker 3>And the waves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not particularly dangerous meditation.</v>

3076
02:18:17.831 --> 02:18:19.810
<v Speaker 3>There's almost no risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So where,</v>

3077
02:18:19.870 --> 02:18:22.750
<v Speaker 3>where are your risk tolerances?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much time do you have?</v>

3078
02:18:22.990 --> 02:18:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Those are the kinds of questions you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask around this.</v>

3079
02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:30.520
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like the MTMA also would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>way easier for it to be effective,</v>

3080
02:18:30.521 --> 02:18:32.770
<v Speaker 3>whereas with surfing or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3081
02:18:32.771 --> 02:18:35.470
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to really stick to some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a protocol here.</v>

3082
02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:37.150
<v Speaker 3>Have stick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're constantly doing it.</v>

3083
02:18:37.151 --> 02:18:40.570
<v Speaker 3>Really getting involved in staying </v>
<v Speaker 3>engaged in it where if you do ecstasy,</v>

3084
02:18:40.571 --> 02:18:41.404
<v Speaker 3>you kind of have to be engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just takes what hunter said right by </v>

3085
02:18:43.841 --> 02:18:44.860
<v Speaker 3>the ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take the ride.</v>

3086
02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:46.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just takes you.</v>

3087
02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:47.380
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>

3088
02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:48.220
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

3089
02:18:48.220 --> 02:18:50.260
<v Speaker 3>Let me write that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I talk about effortlessness,</v>

3090
02:18:50.261 --> 02:18:51.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>With flow,</v>

3091
02:18:51.221 --> 02:18:53.590
<v Speaker 3>it's every action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every decision leads seamlessly,</v>

3092
02:18:53.591 --> 02:18:54.311
<v Speaker 3>perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The next one,</v>

3093
02:18:54.311 --> 02:18:57.160
<v Speaker 3>you talking about the effortlessness of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a psychedelic experience,</v>

3094
02:18:57.460 --> 02:18:59.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drop the pill,</v>

3095
02:18:59.861 --> 02:19:00.694
<v Speaker 3>take the hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you are effortlessly in another </v>

3096
02:19:03.191 --> 02:19:04.390
<v Speaker 3>altar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3097
02:19:04.391 --> 02:19:05.440
<v Speaker 3>You're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3098
02:19:05.441 --> 02:19:06.274
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really excited about the fact that </v>

3099
02:19:07.391 --> 02:19:08.224
<v Speaker 3>marijuana has been legalized in </v>
<v Speaker 3>California and now I hopefully I hope </v>

3100
02:19:12.550 --> 02:19:13.383
<v Speaker 3>we're going to start to see some headway</v>
<v Speaker 3>being moved into other psychedelic </v>

3101
02:19:16.631 --> 02:19:18.580
<v Speaker 3>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's mushrooms or Lsd.</v>

3102
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:22.870
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of drugs that </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be incredibly beneficial to people</v>

3103
02:19:23.110 --> 02:19:25.380
<v Speaker 3>that aren't being utilized where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ibogaine.</v>

3104
02:19:25.510 --> 02:19:26.980
<v Speaker 3>I believe we were talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>before the.</v>

3105
02:19:27.540 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 3>We were talking</v>

3106
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:33.010
<v Speaker 2>about animals that target various,</v>
<v Speaker 2>various ways of altering their states of</v>

3107
02:19:33.081 --> 02:19:34.160
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3108
02:19:34.190 --> 02:19:38.600
<v Speaker 2>I know dolphins find puffer fish and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>high upper fish puff,</v>

3109
02:19:38.601 --> 02:19:43.280
<v Speaker 2>puff pass our goats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gobble,</v>

3110
02:19:45.050 --> 02:19:47.950
<v Speaker 2>gobble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>locoweed loco,</v>

3111
02:19:47.951 --> 02:19:49.840
<v Speaker 2>loco loco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd is cows.</v>

3112
02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Cats are catnip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baboons,</v>

3113
02:19:52.580 --> 02:19:54.850
<v Speaker 2>as we talked about where I boga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3114
02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:58.330
<v Speaker 2>the reindeer obviously are going after </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mushrooms,</v>

3115
02:19:58.350 --> 02:20:00.800
<v Speaker 2>many to ms Dot Kara.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dogs are gone for silicide.</v>

3116
02:20:00.810 --> 02:20:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Been is what they found.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are probably other things.</v>

3117
02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:03.673
<v Speaker 2>Elephants pretty much at any animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>found a way to alter their </v>

3118
02:20:05.811 --> 02:20:06.644
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elephants will drink fermented bog </v>

3119
02:20:07.761 --> 02:20:11.150
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's otters if they can't,</v>

3120
02:20:11.151 --> 02:20:13.010
<v Speaker 2>and I can't remember what their drug of </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice is,</v>

3121
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:15.590
<v Speaker 2>but if they can't find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will actually hit themselves in the</v>

3122
02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:17.960
<v Speaker 2>head with a rock to alter their </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

3123
02:20:18.220 --> 02:20:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

3124
02:20:20.101 --> 02:20:21.180
<v Speaker 2>I've done that personally on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3125
02:20:21.350 --> 02:20:22.790
<v Speaker 2>on occasion a couple of times.</v>

3126
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:24.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

3127
02:20:24.201 --> 02:20:26.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be hard outs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I watched a hotter kill a monkey the</v>

3128
02:20:26.721 --> 02:20:29.540
<v Speaker 2>other day online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otter drowned a monkey.</v>

3129
02:20:29.650 --> 02:20:30.483
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in the other markets to trying to </v>

3130
02:20:32.241 --> 02:20:33.440
<v Speaker 2>rescue them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the monkey.</v>

3131
02:20:33.441 --> 02:20:34.460
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

3132
02:20:34.461 --> 02:20:37.880
<v Speaker 2>And the audit took the monkey and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding on him when drowning them.</v>

3133
02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:39.290
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3134
02:20:39.410 --> 02:20:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Otters are murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>

3135
02:20:41.601 --> 02:20:42.780
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3136
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea the,</v>

3137
02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:46.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're uh,</v>

3138
02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:46.953
<v Speaker 2>they're crazy little animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you were listing before the podcast </v>

3139
02:20:49.551 --> 02:20:50.384
<v Speaker 2>started all the various animals that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have found some way to alter their </v>

3140
02:20:53.901 --> 02:20:56.000
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and it's almost all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3141
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:57.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is not.</v>

3142
02:20:57.800 --> 02:20:59.750
<v Speaker 2>This is the guy who did this original </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

3143
02:20:59.751 --> 02:21:02.330
<v Speaker 2>Let's give credit where credit is due.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Ronald K Siegel.</v>

3144
02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:03.433
<v Speaker 2>He's at Ucla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you really want to read the </v>

3145
02:21:04.700 --> 02:21:07.100
<v Speaker 2>cortext on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a book called intoxication.</v>

3146
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:08.383
<v Speaker 2>And it covers kind of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at this point they believe that </v>

3147
02:21:11.841 --> 02:21:13.460
<v Speaker 2>pretty much every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3148
02:21:13.461 --> 02:21:15.590
<v Speaker 2>at least mammalian species and earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the birds do it.</v>

3149
02:21:15.591 --> 02:21:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Two birds will go crazy for marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeds if they can get them,</v>

3150
02:21:19.820 --> 02:21:22.980
<v Speaker 2>has found a way to alter their </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and there's very few,</v>

3151
02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.610
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's very good reasons for it and</v>

3152
02:21:25.611 --> 02:21:29.720
<v Speaker 2>it's animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like humans get stuck in ruts and they,</v>

3153
02:21:29.950 --> 02:21:30.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3154
02:21:30.580 --> 02:21:31.413
<v Speaker 2>you keep doing the same pattern over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and you're getting no results and </v>

3155
02:21:33.681 --> 02:21:35.660
<v Speaker 2>you have to be to kind of shift your </v>
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

3156
02:21:35.661 --> 02:21:40.100
<v Speaker 2>changed the channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so using the Edward Edward de Bono,</v>

3157
02:21:40.130 --> 02:21:40.963
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talks about psychedelics in these kinds </v>

3158
02:21:42.351 --> 02:21:44.810
<v Speaker 2>of substances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>d patterning instruments,</v>

3159
02:21:44.990 --> 02:21:49.010
<v Speaker 2>they allow us to break out of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns and they allow us to innovate.</v>

3160
02:21:49.011 --> 02:21:50.270
<v Speaker 2>Basically they put us in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3161
02:21:50.271 --> 02:21:53.630
<v Speaker 2>innovative Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which for survival is critical.</v>

3162
02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:54.463
<v Speaker 2>So every species seems to have found one</v>
<v Speaker 2>way or the other to alter their </v>

3163
02:21:58.281 --> 02:22:02.030
<v Speaker 2>consciousness to upc kind of cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance and creativity.</v>

3164
02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:03.343
<v Speaker 2>Problem solve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is fascinating that these animals </v>

3165
02:22:05.091 --> 02:22:05.924
<v Speaker 2>would want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would think that what they would </v>

3166
02:22:07.131 --> 02:22:08.760
<v Speaker 2>want is to be constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3167
02:22:08.761 --> 02:22:09.650
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're on TV,</v>

3168
02:22:10.380 --> 02:22:12.020
<v Speaker 2>we're back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3169
02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:13.123
<v Speaker 2>you would think that these animals would</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be constantly aware of their </v>

3170
02:22:15.531 --> 02:22:17.610
<v Speaker 2>surroundings and constantly alert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3171
02:22:17.620 --> 02:22:18.590
<v Speaker 2>So that was the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3172
02:22:18.591 --> 02:22:19.424
<v Speaker 2>That was the big question that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>started to ask is like with the fuck </v>

3173
02:22:22.101 --> 02:22:23.720
<v Speaker 2>with this come from like how if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3174
02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:26.180
<v Speaker 2>if it's red in tooth and claw</v>

3175
02:22:26.180 --> 02:22:28.380
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you possibly,</v>

3176
02:22:28.610 --> 02:22:29.443
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to take a psychedelic like Iboga </v>

3177
02:22:31.441 --> 02:22:32.274
<v Speaker 1>where you're talking about the Jaguars </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking Iowasca where the effects are </v>

3178
02:22:34.710 --> 02:22:38.190
<v Speaker 1>significant and long lasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3179
02:22:38.191 --> 02:22:39.420
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3180
02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:40.283
<v Speaker 1>the answer seems to be that the creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem solving boost you get from </v>

3181
02:22:45.301 --> 02:22:46.134
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics is worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could just be that the highfields so </v>

3182
02:22:48.811 --> 02:22:51.000
<v Speaker 1>good that everybody wants it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

3183
02:22:51.001 --> 02:22:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Well it also could be like some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a stress alleviation mechanism for a lot</v>

3184
02:22:55.321 --> 02:22:56.154
<v Speaker 1>of these animals that are dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Tooth Fang and clogs assistance of </v>

3185
02:22:58.601 --> 02:23:01.290
<v Speaker 1>being a wild animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just distress if at all.</v>

3186
02:23:01.291 --> 02:23:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes I just need a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>break,</v>

3187
02:23:03.930 --> 02:23:04.763
<v Speaker 1>so drink some fermented fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fermented Bhagwat water whacked out and </v>

3188
02:23:08.190 --> 02:23:09.023
<v Speaker 1>chill out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Awhile we were talking about the </v>

3189
02:23:09.841 --> 02:23:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Jaguars that take a dmt rich plants is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the thing I don't understand,</v>

3190
02:23:14.341 --> 02:23:16.920
<v Speaker 1>isn't Ios is a blend of two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>plants.</v>

3191
02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did the Jaguars get both?</v>

3192
02:23:20.020 --> 02:23:21.000
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3193
02:23:21.001 --> 02:23:21.834
<v Speaker 1>the question would be whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jaguars have monoamine oxidase and your </v>

3194
02:23:24.570 --> 02:23:25.403
<v Speaker 1>stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3195
02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:26.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the exact question that they </v>

3196
02:23:26.910 --> 02:23:28.410
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would make sense.</v>

3197
02:23:28.411 --> 02:23:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what if they don't?</v>

3198
02:23:30.570 --> 02:23:32.830
<v Speaker 1>That means that it's active to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3199
02:23:32.940 --> 02:23:33.721
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3200
02:23:33.721 --> 02:23:37.230
<v Speaker 1>we eat plants and we meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're omnivores.</v>

3201
02:23:37.231 --> 02:23:40.410
<v Speaker 1>They are obligate predators so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't need any plants.</v>

3202
02:23:40.650 --> 02:23:43.200
<v Speaker 1>So when they do eat plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just eating them for a goof.</v>

3203
02:23:43.620 --> 02:23:44.453
<v Speaker 1>So if they do eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably don't have the </v>

3204
02:23:46.260 --> 02:23:50.670
<v Speaker 1>compensatory mechanisms in their system </v>
<v Speaker 1>to process the DMT rich plants.</v>

3205
02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:51.760
<v Speaker 1>And we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3206
02:23:51.761 --> 02:23:56.130
<v Speaker 1>that's what model amy knock stays does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why Mao inhibitors or you know,</v>

3207
02:23:56.190 --> 02:23:58.560
<v Speaker 1>they use harming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they mix it up with the.</v>

3208
02:23:59.250 --> 02:24:04.250
<v Speaker 1>But people that have taken actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pharmaceutical grade Mao inhibitors</v>

3209
02:24:04.591 --> 02:24:06.270
<v Speaker 1>to have horrible experiences.</v>

3210
02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you try to use an,</v>

3211
02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:09.623
<v Speaker 1>a real Mao inhibitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like from a pharmaceutical company and </v>

3212
02:24:12.211 --> 02:24:16.860
<v Speaker 1>then throw some dmt in there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it's a real bad time.</v>

3213
02:24:17.060 --> 02:24:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3214
02:24:17.921 --> 02:24:21.990
<v Speaker 1>and it's super dangerous and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could break your fucking brain.</v>

3215
02:24:22.410 --> 02:24:26.070
<v Speaker 1>There's some would story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some horror stories.</v>

3216
02:24:26.071 --> 02:24:26.904
<v Speaker 1>It might be or what it might be some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other website where the people were </v>

3217
02:24:28.330 --> 02:24:30.780
<v Speaker 1>documenting trips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hyperspace lexicon.</v>

3218
02:24:31.050 --> 02:24:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were just saying,</v>

3219
02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:35.670
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do this important safety tip.</v>

3220
02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:39.900
<v Speaker 1>I've also heard horrible experiences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people mixing mushrooms and DMT.</v>

3221
02:24:40.410 --> 02:24:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I've heard really bad experiences with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as well.</v>

3222
02:24:44.030 --> 02:24:44.863
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like it has a habit not to </v>

3223
02:24:48.421 --> 02:24:49.254
<v Speaker 1>get metaphysical about DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has a habit of smacking down </v>

3224
02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:54.113
<v Speaker 1>certain users.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people tell those stories that </v>

3225
02:24:56.510 --> 02:24:59.880
<v Speaker 1>something about the substance doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow itself to be abused.</v>

3226
02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:02.300
<v Speaker 1>You find that a lot in our wood and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperspace lexicon,</v>

3227
02:25:02.310 --> 02:25:04.950
<v Speaker 1>places like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sort of gets to a point and then it</v>

3228
02:25:04.951 --> 02:25:07.710
<v Speaker 1>warns you and cutting out the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

3229
02:25:07.711 --> 02:25:09.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any idea what the hell that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>

3230
02:25:09.691 --> 02:25:11.550
<v Speaker 1>and I just said it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like it's interesting.</v>

3231
02:25:11.690 --> 02:25:12.523
<v Speaker 1>That's the exact description of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tattooist that I know who had done it </v>

3232
02:25:15.031 --> 02:25:20.031
<v Speaker 1>like 100 days in a row and then finally </v>
<v Speaker 1>he said like literally when he tripped,</v>

3233
02:25:20.221 --> 02:25:21.830
<v Speaker 1>he went into this dimension and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

3234
02:25:22.260 --> 02:25:23.680
<v Speaker 1>they were kicking them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

3235
02:25:23.690 --> 02:25:25.210
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fuck you gotta.</v>

3236
02:25:25.211 --> 02:25:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Stop doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were very adamant,</v>

3237
02:25:27.790 --> 02:25:31.550
<v Speaker 3>damaged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exact story happened to a friend of mine</v>

3238
02:25:31.610 --> 02:25:33.200
<v Speaker 3>who was just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was told he was,</v>

3239
02:25:33.230 --> 02:25:33.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3240
02:25:33.740 --> 02:25:36.920
<v Speaker 3>He's tripping balls and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not to do this again.</v>

3241
02:25:37.460 --> 02:25:38.420
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3242
02:25:38.820 --> 02:25:41.000
<v Speaker 1>That completely makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3243
02:25:41.001 --> 02:25:41.834
<v Speaker 1>if it seems to me like something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only really handle in small </v>

3244
02:25:45.471 --> 02:25:47.600
<v Speaker 1>doses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally he'd go in,</v>

3245
02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:49.970
<v Speaker 1>you get your brains blown out and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back,</v>

3246
02:25:49.971 --> 02:25:52.190
<v Speaker 1>sort of regroup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to assess what,</v>

3247
02:25:52.191 --> 02:25:54.350
<v Speaker 1>if anything you could take out of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and learn,</v>

3248
02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:55.513
<v Speaker 1>get humbled by the fact that this exists</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all and then sort of try to reassess </v>

3249
02:25:59.571 --> 02:26:00.310
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

3250
02:26:00.310 --> 02:26:02.160
<v Speaker 3>We talk about that a lot in stealing </v>
<v Speaker 3>fire in that,</v>

3251
02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:03.910
<v Speaker 3>in the book that's coming out in </v>
<v Speaker 3>February,</v>

3252
02:26:03.911 --> 02:26:08.911
<v Speaker 3>whereas it seems like if you've never </v>
<v Speaker 3>had any experiences with altered states,</v>

3253
02:26:09.281 --> 02:26:09.730
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3254
02:26:09.730 --> 02:26:11.540
<v Speaker 3>any of these flow states or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

3255
02:26:12.610 --> 02:26:13.443
<v Speaker 3>you need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of reality shattering first </v>

3256
02:26:16.271 --> 02:26:18.070
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just so you know,</v>

3257
02:26:18.071 --> 02:26:18.904
<v Speaker 3>that this domain exists and maybe go </v>
<v Speaker 3>skydiving and have that kind of a flow </v>

3258
02:26:22.571 --> 02:26:23.404
<v Speaker 3>state experience or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a psycho and then you need it less </v>

3259
02:26:26.141 --> 02:26:26.974
<v Speaker 3>and less and less than you can get a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>farther with less and there seems to be </v>

3260
02:26:32.081 --> 02:26:34.780
<v Speaker 3>some something there with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about</v>

3261
02:26:34.930 --> 02:26:37.780
<v Speaker 1>the idea of mixing up a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different modalities?</v>

3262
02:26:37.781 --> 02:26:39.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there any benefit in.</v>

3263
02:26:39.370 --> 02:26:39.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

3264
02:26:39.810 --> 02:26:41.450
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

3265
02:26:41.810 --> 02:26:45.290
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is when I'm really happy about,</v>

3266
02:26:45.350 --> 02:26:46.580
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3267
02:26:46.581 --> 02:26:51.581
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a Rick Doblin if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a longtime friend of mine.</v>

3268
02:26:51.801 --> 02:26:53.750
<v Speaker 3>I've known him for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is so important.</v>

3269
02:26:53.751 --> 02:26:54.531
<v Speaker 3>Is Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3270
02:26:54.531 --> 02:26:55.460
<v Speaker 3>he's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great girl.</v>

3271
02:26:55.500 --> 02:26:57.740
<v Speaker 3>He's dealing with maps is just so </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful.</v>

3272
02:26:57.750 --> 02:27:01.130
<v Speaker 3>So huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we were talking about,</v>

3273
02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:02.953
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a psychedelic medicine at this point is </v>

3274
02:27:04.491 --> 02:27:05.240
<v Speaker 3>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3275
02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:06.800
<v Speaker 3>everybody knows it's gone on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

3276
02:27:06.801 --> 02:27:07.634
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting going on at the </v>

3277
02:27:08.361 --> 02:27:10.940
<v Speaker 3>cutting edge and it's so basic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost stupid.</v>

3278
02:27:10.941 --> 02:27:13.490
<v Speaker 3>You can't even believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but lo and behold,</v>

3279
02:27:13.491 --> 02:27:14.324
<v Speaker 3>they're discovering that if you combine </v>
<v Speaker 3>the occasional mtma session with </v>

3280
02:27:18.771 --> 02:27:21.770
<v Speaker 3>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>occasionally you get farther,</v>

3281
02:27:21.771 --> 02:27:23.720
<v Speaker 3>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big surprise,</v>

3282
02:27:23.721 --> 02:27:24.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3283
02:27:24.380 --> 02:27:25.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm this and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3284
02:27:25.971 --> 02:27:28.760
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth of the matter is once you move</v>

3285
02:27:28.761 --> 02:27:29.594
<v Speaker 3>into these cultures effort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's blending state changing </v>

3286
02:27:32.091 --> 02:27:32.924
<v Speaker 3>technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're using your martial arts for flow </v>

3287
02:27:34.971 --> 02:27:35.804
<v Speaker 3>states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're using your yoga breathing </v>

3288
02:27:36.921 --> 02:27:39.170
<v Speaker 3>techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're having the occasional psychedelic</v>

3289
02:27:39.171 --> 02:27:42.230
<v Speaker 3>experience at burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're smoking pot,</v>

3290
02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:42.830
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

3291
02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:43.663
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's blending all this stuff </v>

3292
02:27:44.271 --> 02:27:45.104
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very rare that you find somebody </v>

3293
02:27:48.231 --> 02:27:48.921
<v Speaker 3>who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3294
02:27:48.921 --> 02:27:49.720
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3295
02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:52.280
<v Speaker 3>I only do one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3296
02:27:52.460 --> 02:27:53.400
<v Speaker 3>that they do.</v>

3297
02:27:53.410 --> 02:27:56.340
<v Speaker 1>If they're so rigid and they're probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>not getting the same benefits out of it,</v>

3298
02:27:56.341 --> 02:27:59.120
<v Speaker 1>that they would if they were just more </v>
<v Speaker 1>open and loose about it.</v>

3299
02:27:59.121 --> 02:27:59.954
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably true too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's so many different ways </v>

3300
02:28:02.071 --> 02:28:02.904
<v Speaker 1>to endogenously a trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these chemicals that I think we need to </v>

3301
02:28:09.751 --> 02:28:10.584
<v Speaker 1>explore more and one of the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking about for so long and </v>

3302
02:28:13.881 --> 02:28:15.510
<v Speaker 1>I've really never get off my ass and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3303
02:28:15.930 --> 02:28:19.290
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to so many people that get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into Kundalini,</v>

3304
02:28:19.690 --> 02:28:21.830
<v Speaker 1>couldn't any of that and that Kundalini </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoga,</v>

3305
02:28:21.831 --> 02:28:25.160
<v Speaker 1>once you practice it for long periods of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and once you get really good at it,</v>

3306
02:28:25.161 --> 02:28:25.994
<v Speaker 1>you figure out a way or your brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures out a way to access these </v>

3307
02:28:30.020 --> 02:28:30.853
<v Speaker 1>dimensions that you would normally only </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve if you were on psychedelic </v>

3308
02:28:33.981 --> 02:28:34.814
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>States of minds that were very similar </v>

3309
02:28:37.821 --> 02:28:40.910
<v Speaker 1>to the DMT state and you can do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>through Kundalini Yoga,</v>

3310
02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:45.560
<v Speaker 1>but it 45 minutes of intense practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>for long periods of time.</v>

3311
02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many weeks in a row.</v>

3312
02:28:46.701 --> 02:28:47.534
<v Speaker 1>And then you can kind of get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will say that in talking to a Brian </v>

3313
02:28:51.830 --> 02:28:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Mackenzie and layered with about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of what they're doing and it's this</v>

3314
02:28:54.591 --> 02:28:55.424
<v Speaker 1>blend of a kind of like box breathing </v>
<v Speaker 1>coupled by sort of like the Wim Hoff </v>

3315
02:28:59.391 --> 02:29:02.400
<v Speaker 1>protocol for the breathing protocol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they've,</v>

3316
02:29:02.420 --> 02:29:03.253
<v Speaker 1>they've developed into a system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they claim that they're getting full on </v>

3317
02:29:07.611 --> 02:29:08.444
<v Speaker 1>dmt experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laird Hamilton's tripping balls lot </v>

3318
02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:13.730
<v Speaker 1>through the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the breath holding work.</v>

3319
02:29:13.740 --> 02:29:14.573
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he said,</v>

3320
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:16.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's doing the substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to.</v>

3321
02:29:16.821 --> 02:29:17.654
<v Speaker 1>I mean the brain produces the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which was one of the most fascinating </v>

3322
02:29:20.361 --> 02:29:21.194
<v Speaker 1>thing about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most potent psychedelic drug known </v>

3323
02:29:22.911 --> 02:29:24.710
<v Speaker 1>to man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's made in the body.</v>

3324
02:29:25.450 --> 02:29:27.500
<v Speaker 1>It's in pretty much every cell in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

3325
02:29:28.190 --> 02:29:29.190
<v Speaker 1>What it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3326
02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:34.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was Mckenna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was probably was Dennis Dennis,</v>

3327
02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:35.713
<v Speaker 1>who I think he pointed out that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of us is walking around with enough </v>

3328
02:29:39.891 --> 02:29:42.290
<v Speaker 1>of an illegal substance in our system to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to jail forever.</v>

3329
02:29:42.290 --> 02:29:44.890
<v Speaker 1>You go buy an orange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3330
02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:47.240
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's enough dmt and an orange to send</v>

3331
02:29:47.241 --> 02:29:49.220
<v Speaker 1>you to jail for the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it real?</v>

3332
02:29:49.221 --> 02:29:50.054
<v Speaker 1>It's everywhere in orange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know they hadn't been </v>

3333
02:29:52.130 --> 02:29:53.420
<v Speaker 1>oranges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

3334
02:29:53.450 --> 02:29:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird drug when your whole.</v>

3335
02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:56.663
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like making saliva illegal or </v>

3336
02:29:57.771 --> 02:29:58.890
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3337
02:29:59.130 --> 02:30:01.190
<v Speaker 1>it's so common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

3338
02:30:01.191 --> 02:30:02.024
<v Speaker 1>very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that you can make your </v>

3339
02:30:04.101 --> 02:30:08.420
<v Speaker 1>brain produce large dumps of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can figure out a way.</v>

3340
02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:11.060
<v Speaker 1>And apparently Kundalini Yoga is the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3341
02:30:11.210 --> 02:30:13.730
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife practices Kundalini Yoga.</v>

3342
02:30:13.940 --> 02:30:15.320
<v Speaker 1>I've never asked her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's tripping.</v>

3343
02:30:15.680 --> 02:30:16.513
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she hasn't.</v>

3344
02:30:16.520 --> 02:30:18.900
<v Speaker 1>She hasn't reported it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

3345
02:30:18.960 --> 02:30:21.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she certainly gets her into flow states.</v>

3346
02:30:21.111 --> 02:30:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Right story of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3347
02:30:23.390 --> 02:30:25.030
<v Speaker 1>it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3348
02:30:25.070 --> 02:30:27.890
<v Speaker 1>I think what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're saying before about marijuana</v>

3349
02:30:27.891 --> 02:30:32.891
<v Speaker 1>being legalized and the fact that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>took until 2016 in California.</v>

3350
02:30:33.410 --> 02:30:36.440
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really filled with folly.</v>

3351
02:30:36.680 --> 02:30:37.513
<v Speaker 1>I really hope that this opens up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>door to all these other non toxic drugs </v>

3352
02:30:41.481 --> 02:30:43.580
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like psilocybin,</v>

3353
02:30:43.581 --> 02:30:44.414
<v Speaker 1>which has this ridiculously high ld 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate where you would literally have to </v>

3354
02:30:47.061 --> 02:30:49.780
<v Speaker 1>eat pounds of it to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>

3355
02:30:49.790 --> 02:30:50.623
<v Speaker 1>I'm really hoping that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get more and more research and more and </v>

3356
02:30:53.691 --> 02:30:54.524
<v Speaker 1>more understanding things like I began </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we were talking about before the </v>

3357
02:30:56.901 --> 02:30:58.640
<v Speaker 1>podcast where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3358
02:30:58.700 --> 02:31:01.580
<v Speaker 1>my friend Ed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has a center down in Mexico,</v>

3359
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:05.780
<v Speaker 1>he was hooked on pills and he got one to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

3360
02:31:05.930 --> 02:31:06.763
<v Speaker 1>took an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3361
02:31:06.860 --> 02:31:10.220
<v Speaker 1>went on Ibogaine trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely cured him of his addiction to</v>

3362
02:31:10.221 --> 02:31:11.054
<v Speaker 1>opiates and now he runs the center and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so many people that have had these </v>

3363
02:31:15.171 --> 02:31:16.004
<v Speaker 1>problems with pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a gigantic problem in our </v>

3364
02:31:17.541 --> 02:31:19.250
<v Speaker 1>culture today because they're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevalent.</v>

3365
02:31:19.710 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

3366
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:22.260
<v Speaker 3>so much of that could be cured with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ibogaine,</v>

3367
02:31:23.310 --> 02:31:24.550
<v Speaker 3>the Ibogaine hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3368
02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:26.640
<v Speaker 3>opiate addiction research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3369
02:31:26.641 --> 02:31:28.710
<v Speaker 3>that's where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the drug got interesting.</v>

3370
02:31:28.711 --> 02:31:29.830
<v Speaker 3>If people in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3371
02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:30.673
<v Speaker 3>They going all called the movie back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fifties or sixties when they first </v>

3372
02:31:33.601 --> 02:31:37.110
<v Speaker 3>started realizing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm certainly,</v>

3373
02:31:37.111 --> 02:31:37.944
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3374
02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:41.340
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many great questions that you</v>

3375
02:31:41.341 --> 02:31:42.174
<v Speaker 3>can start asking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can ask when we talk about </v>

3376
02:31:43.801 --> 02:31:45.150
<v Speaker 3>consciousness earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>

3377
02:31:45.420 --> 02:31:48.950
<v Speaker 3>These are phenomenally good tools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3378
02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:49.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3379
02:31:50.040 --> 02:31:52.890
<v Speaker 3>in stealing fire where you write about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the work of Robin Card Harris,</v>

3380
02:31:52.891 --> 02:31:53.724
<v Speaker 3>who is the first person to use f Mri to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do visualizations of the brain on </v>

3381
02:31:58.681 --> 02:32:00.510
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we now know what the brain looks like</v>

3382
02:32:00.511 --> 02:32:02.340
<v Speaker 3>on Lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know what the world looks like on,</v>

3383
02:32:02.750 --> 02:32:04.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psilocybin as he says,</v>

3384
02:32:04.290 --> 02:32:04.951
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3385
02:32:04.951 --> 02:32:08.160
<v Speaker 3>we're starting to understand where all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this mind expansion is coming from.</v>

3386
02:32:08.160 --> 02:32:09.230
<v Speaker 3>And we actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3387
02:32:09.240 --> 02:32:11.430
<v Speaker 3>the heightened creativity that we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been talking about,</v>

3388
02:32:11.730 --> 02:32:14.550
<v Speaker 3>we now know what that looks like and why</v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens.</v>

3389
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:15.623
<v Speaker 3>I think we're at the front edge of </v>
<v Speaker 3>starting to ask the interesting </v>

3390
02:32:18.211 --> 02:32:19.320
<v Speaker 3>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3391
02:32:19.470 --> 02:32:22.290
<v Speaker 3>A lot of what we've done in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in kind of psychedelic research,</v>

3392
02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:23.333
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this renaissance that we're going </v>

3393
02:32:24.061 --> 02:32:24.894
<v Speaker 3>through is rerun all the experiments </v>
<v Speaker 3>they ran back in the sixties and </v>

3394
02:32:28.351 --> 02:32:29.184
<v Speaker 3>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3395
02:32:29.310 --> 02:32:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Because nobody trusts those damn hippies</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their research.</v>

3396
02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:35.400
<v Speaker 3>So we've just done a lot of that work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3397
02:32:35.401 --> 02:32:38.070
<v Speaker 3>we've done it more rigorously and was </v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly better tools.</v>

3398
02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:39.690
<v Speaker 3>But if you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3399
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:43.320
<v Speaker 3>the classic suicide instead of the Good </v>
<v Speaker 3>Friday experiment,</v>

3400
02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:44.493
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was done in the marsh chapel in 1962 </v>

3401
02:32:49.650 --> 02:32:51.810
<v Speaker 3>and this was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was the first study that said,</v>

3402
02:32:51.811 --> 02:32:52.644
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do psychedelics produce valid quote </v>

3403
02:32:55.171 --> 02:32:57.330
<v Speaker 3>unquote mystical experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3404
02:32:57.331 --> 02:32:57.940
<v Speaker 3>And the and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3405
02:32:57.940 --> 02:32:58.773
<v Speaker 3>the study and then Rick Doblin redid it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then Roland Griffith at Johns </v>

3406
02:33:03.420 --> 02:33:04.253
<v Speaker 3>Hopkins read it and then it's been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this one study has been redone four </v>

3407
02:33:09.181 --> 02:33:10.014
<v Speaker 3>times to get the exact same result </v>
<v Speaker 3>because nobody wants to believe it </v>

3408
02:33:12.870 --> 02:33:13.703
<v Speaker 3>because they don't trust me because </v>
<v Speaker 3>these substances are so volatile and </v>

3409
02:33:15.511 --> 02:33:17.310
<v Speaker 3>scare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scare us so much.</v>

3410
02:33:17.950 --> 02:33:18.783
<v Speaker 1>Well not in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's one thing I think also to suck </v>

3411
02:33:20.830 --> 02:33:21.663
<v Speaker 1>the concentrate on not just substances </v>
<v Speaker 1>but also states of mind that can be </v>

3412
02:33:24.491 --> 02:33:26.590
<v Speaker 1>achieved consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on purpose,</v>

3413
02:33:26.591 --> 02:33:27.424
<v Speaker 1>like mindfulness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like concentrating on being in the </v>

3414
02:33:30.191 --> 02:33:33.910
<v Speaker 1>moment like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can alter the way you view the world</v>

3415
02:33:34.090 --> 02:33:37.290
<v Speaker 1>by the way you concentrate on the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment that you,</v>

3416
02:33:37.300 --> 02:33:38.530
<v Speaker 1>you're existing in right now.</v>

3417
02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:40.353
<v Speaker 3>Her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3418
02:33:40.480 --> 02:33:41.313
<v Speaker 3>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the combination of stuff as you brought </v>

3419
02:33:43.631 --> 02:33:46.450
<v Speaker 3>up is where also this is going to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get interesting when you,</v>

3420
02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:50.260
<v Speaker 3>when we start really figuring out how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>skillfully blend these things together,</v>

3421
02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:53.380
<v Speaker 3>turn them into protocols to that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit of</v>

3422
02:33:53.520 --> 02:33:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Dma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of meditation.</v>

3423
02:33:56.470 --> 02:33:57.303
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit of this for flow a little </v>

3424
02:33:59.351 --> 02:33:59.640
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3425
02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:01.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other thing is,</v>

3426
02:34:01.390 --> 02:34:02.223
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics are the technology we're </v>

3427
02:34:05.411 --> 02:34:06.244
<v Speaker 3>talking about most now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most of these things are achievable </v>

3428
02:34:08.411 --> 02:34:10.500
<v Speaker 3>with actual technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3429
02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:11.413
<v Speaker 3>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different than.</v>

3430
02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:15.250
<v Speaker 3>And we're going to get more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

3431
02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:18.700
<v Speaker 3>there's a company called Palo Alto </v>
<v Speaker 3>Neuroscience,</v>

3432
02:34:18.970 --> 02:34:20.200
<v Speaker 3>Palo Alto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroscience,</v>

3433
02:34:20.201 --> 02:34:22.570
<v Speaker 3>and this is early stages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're not there yet,</v>

3434
02:34:22.571 --> 02:34:26.990
<v Speaker 3>but what they're working towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>figuring out is say you are a trained to</v>

3435
02:34:26.991 --> 02:34:31.080
<v Speaker 3>Benton Lama and you can meditate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>drop your brain down to that Alpha Theta</v>

3436
02:34:31.090 --> 02:34:35.120
<v Speaker 3>borderline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can record various biomarkers,</v>

3437
02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:36.690
<v Speaker 3>galvanic skin response,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3438
02:34:36.730 --> 02:34:37.563
<v Speaker 3>a couple of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of other things while you're in </v>

3439
02:34:40.271 --> 02:34:41.104
<v Speaker 3>that meditative state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they can take that recording </v>

3440
02:34:43.630 --> 02:34:44.463
<v Speaker 3>and an egg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it on somebody who's an absolute </v>

3441
02:34:46.481 --> 02:34:51.481
<v Speaker 3>novice and use that as neurofeedback to </v>
<v Speaker 3>guide somebody else into your state,</v>

3442
02:34:52.660 --> 02:34:53.860
<v Speaker 3>into the state you were in.</v>

3443
02:34:54.310 --> 02:34:56.590
<v Speaker 3>This is worth the front edge of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3444
02:34:56.890 --> 02:34:57.723
<v Speaker 3>But more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is really starting to come some of </v>

3445
02:35:02.081 --> 02:35:03.130
<v Speaker 3>this stuff with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3446
02:35:03.131 --> 02:35:03.964
<v Speaker 3>with flow states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got use neurofeedback to drive </v>

3447
02:35:07.271 --> 02:35:08.104
<v Speaker 3>people in the flow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all the work that Chris Burkard </v>

3448
02:35:09.361 --> 02:35:12.790
<v Speaker 3>did it advanced brain monitoring and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know if you've seen her ted talk.</v>

3449
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:14.503
<v Speaker 3>She's got a great ted talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She did a lot of work with the navy on </v>

3450
02:35:16.331 --> 02:35:17.230
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

3451
02:35:17.260 --> 02:35:18.093
<v Speaker 3>we're using,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got technology that'll drive you </v>

3452
02:35:19.481 --> 02:35:21.490
<v Speaker 3>into flow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got technology that is going to be</v>

3453
02:35:21.491 --> 02:35:23.020
<v Speaker 3>able to mimic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>

3454
02:35:23.021 --> 02:35:24.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now today,</v>

3455
02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:29.040
<v Speaker 3>2016,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about psychedelics and you</v>

3456
02:35:29.100 --> 02:35:31.810
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these pills that affect these molecules.</v>

3457
02:35:31.811 --> 02:35:33.640
<v Speaker 3>But we've got technology coming that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming,</v>

3458
02:35:33.641 --> 02:35:34.540
<v Speaker 3>that's letting us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3459
02:35:34.541 --> 02:35:36.310
<v Speaker 3>just to interface directly with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

3460
02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:40.240
<v Speaker 3>And that's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm a little confused.</v>

3461
02:35:40.450 --> 02:35:44.410
<v Speaker 3>How are you experiencing someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 3>flow state?</v>

3462
02:35:44.470 --> 02:35:49.000
<v Speaker 3>What is the mechanism like if someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're recording something.</v>

3463
02:35:49.060 --> 02:35:49.893
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

3464
02:35:50.090 --> 02:35:52.330
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would Chris Burke and what the guys</v>

3465
02:35:52.331 --> 02:35:55.020
<v Speaker 3>did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Advanced brain monitoring is there.</v>

3466
02:35:55.070 --> 02:35:57.220
<v Speaker 3>We're working with archers for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marksman,</v>

3467
02:35:57.440 --> 02:35:58.273
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they will record kind of what is </v>

3468
02:36:00.431 --> 02:36:01.264
<v Speaker 3>going on in the brain of an expert </v>
<v Speaker 3>marksman as at the moment they're drawn </v>

3469
02:36:04.750 --> 02:36:05.890
<v Speaker 3>and firing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3470
02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:06.993
<v Speaker 3>And then they're using neurofeedback </v>
<v Speaker 3>with other participants to drive them </v>

3471
02:36:12.011 --> 02:36:12.844
<v Speaker 3>toward that same brain wave state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what they've done is they've cut </v>

3472
02:36:15.761 --> 02:36:18.910
<v Speaker 3>learning times in half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let me do it.</v>

3473
02:36:18.970 --> 02:36:21.700
<v Speaker 3>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can train up an APP.</v>

3474
02:36:21.701 --> 02:36:22.534
<v Speaker 3>They've managed to train up absolute </v>
<v Speaker 3>novices to expert performance and 50 </v>

3475
02:36:26.171 --> 02:36:31.171
<v Speaker 3>percent less time using using this and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what are the novices experiencing?</v>

3476
02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:34.300
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are they doing to them?</v>

3477
02:36:35.110 --> 02:36:38.050
<v Speaker 3>They're novices are just using </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurofeedback,</v>

3478
02:36:38.051 --> 02:36:38.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3479
02:36:38.350 --> 02:36:40.900
<v Speaker 3>So what does that mean though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A neurofeedback means,</v>

3480
02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:42.273
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how our system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember exactly how our system </v>

3481
02:36:45.161 --> 02:36:46.600
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will have to pull up the ted talks so</v>

3482
02:36:46.601 --> 02:36:48.310
<v Speaker 3>I can see it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3483
02:36:49.030 --> 02:36:50.410
<v Speaker 3>let's say it's a tone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3484
02:36:50.411 --> 02:36:51.244
<v Speaker 3>Let's like let's say expert performance </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes place at this borderline Alpha </v>

3485
02:36:55.240 --> 02:36:56.073
<v Speaker 3>Theta borderline brainwave wise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole bunch of other things </v>

3486
02:36:57.431 --> 02:36:59.920
<v Speaker 3>going on and being just crunching it </v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

3487
02:36:59.921 --> 02:37:00.754
<v Speaker 3>but you know when you're closer to there</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear a low pitch sound and when </v>

3488
02:37:05.861 --> 02:37:06.694
<v Speaker 3>you're farther away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pitch gets higher and higher and </v>

3489
02:37:08.141 --> 02:37:09.370
<v Speaker 3>higher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you just,</v>

3490
02:37:09.550 --> 02:37:11.580
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what you're aiming for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ed's brainwaves,</v>

3491
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:13.750
<v Speaker 3>you can't control your brainwaves </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciously,</v>

3492
02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:16.320
<v Speaker 3>but just by providing the feedback and </v>
<v Speaker 3>none,</v>

3493
02:37:16.321 --> 02:37:17.600
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the wrong state of this,</v>

3494
02:37:17.601 --> 02:37:20.090
<v Speaker 3>is the right to your brain will start to</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn.</v>

3495
02:37:20.091 --> 02:37:22.790
<v Speaker 3>That's how neurofeedback works with </v>
<v Speaker 3>trains.</v>

3496
02:37:22.791 --> 02:37:27.791
<v Speaker 3>You just trains your brain to move to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this brainwave state just by giving it a</v>

3497
02:37:28.041 --> 02:37:30.080
<v Speaker 3>little bit of a little feedback loop to </v>
<v Speaker 3>playoff</v>

3498
02:37:30.390 --> 02:37:31.223
<v Speaker 1>and doing this during the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity itself is what accentuates the </v>

3499
02:37:34.861 --> 02:37:37.470
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are they doing the archery themselves</v>

3500
02:37:37.471 --> 02:37:40.560
<v Speaker 1>while they're being inundated with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>tones?</v>

3501
02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

3502
02:37:42.750 --> 02:37:43.583
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're not even consciously </v>

3503
02:37:45.541 --> 02:37:47.880
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I've always wondered,</v>

3504
02:37:47.970 --> 02:37:49.890
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I'm bringing this up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered,</v>

3505
02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:53.160
<v Speaker 1>how far away are we from actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>recording memories?</v>

3506
02:37:53.310 --> 02:37:54.143
<v Speaker 1>Like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you decided to get on your snowboard </v>

3507
02:37:57.540 --> 02:37:58.373
<v Speaker 1>and go down a mountain and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing some sort of a device or some </v>

3508
02:38:02.190 --> 02:38:03.023
<v Speaker 1>you're interfacing with some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>device that can record all of your </v>

3509
02:38:05.731 --> 02:38:07.410
<v Speaker 1>physical experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your emotions,</v>

3510
02:38:07.411 --> 02:38:08.900
<v Speaker 1>your nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your immune.</v>

3511
02:38:08.940 --> 02:38:11.270
<v Speaker 1>You might slip a little bit and have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little little,</v>

3512
02:38:11.280 --> 02:38:12.113
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little scary moment and that that also </v>

3513
02:38:14.761 --> 02:38:15.594
<v Speaker 1>can be related and those memories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then someone else going to be sitting </v>

3514
02:38:17.971 --> 02:38:18.804
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put your whatever device it is </v>

3515
02:38:21.601 --> 02:38:22.434
<v Speaker 1>on them and they can interface with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory and they could experience your </v>

3516
02:38:26.281 --> 02:38:27.180
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3517
02:38:27.181 --> 02:38:28.970
<v Speaker 1>how far away are we from doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

3518
02:38:29.020 --> 02:38:29.853
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Selena smell and he does this </v>

3519
02:38:32.441 --> 02:38:33.274
<v Speaker 3>in a speech he gave a and I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm blanking the name of the company </v>

3520
02:38:37.151 --> 02:38:41.440
<v Speaker 3>that's doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are trying to figure out how to</v>

3521
02:38:41.441 --> 02:38:45.370
<v Speaker 3>record what goes on in the visual cortex</v>
<v Speaker 3>while you dream.</v>

3522
02:38:45.730 --> 02:38:46.563
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so their ultimate goal is to be able to </v>

3523
02:38:47.651 --> 02:38:48.484
<v Speaker 3>play your dreams but get arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if you get arrested for your </v>

3524
02:38:50.441 --> 02:38:51.274
<v Speaker 3>dreams?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing horrible shit and your </v>

3525
02:38:52.181 --> 02:38:53.014
<v Speaker 3>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is precog right where you were in </v>

3526
02:38:55.451 --> 02:38:57.250
<v Speaker 3>minority report.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's happening.</v>

3527
02:38:58.720 --> 02:38:59.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got,</v>

3528
02:38:59.620 --> 02:39:02.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can now go to jail in what should be</v>

3529
02:39:02.711 --> 02:39:06.790
<v Speaker 3>fined $250,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>in New York for using the wrong pronoun.</v>

3530
02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:09.910
<v Speaker 3>So that's probably coming to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3531
02:39:10.310 --> 02:39:11.780
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3532
02:39:11.900 --> 02:39:12.733
<v Speaker 1>if you really can find the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a higher propensity for violence </v>

3533
02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:15.921
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3534
02:39:15.921 --> 02:39:16.754
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're closer to committing violent </v>

3535
02:39:17.751 --> 02:39:19.760
<v Speaker 1>crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't done it yet,</v>

3536
02:39:20.060 --> 02:39:21.570
<v Speaker 3>but they're pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3537
02:39:21.580 --> 02:39:23.130
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talked about this earlier,</v>

3538
02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:27.170
<v Speaker 3>what do you do with the five percent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the population that is sociopathic?</v>

3539
02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:28.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>

3540
02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:31.100
<v Speaker 3>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitler had a couple of ideas.</v>

3541
02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:32.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3542
02:39:32.810 --> 02:39:34.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's the way we should </v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

3543
02:39:34.460 --> 02:39:35.160
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

3544
02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:36.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a way to fix them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3545
02:39:36.901 --> 02:39:37.734
<v Speaker 1>maybe a cognitive research is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead down past where you can understand </v>

3546
02:39:41.431 --> 02:39:44.130
<v Speaker 1>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to increase empathy.</v>

3547
02:39:44.190 --> 02:39:44.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3548
02:39:44.611 --> 02:39:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say how to cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3549
02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:51.450
<v Speaker 1>how to actually unlock it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's some sort of a biochemical</v>

3550
02:39:51.451 --> 02:39:52.284
<v Speaker 1>roadblock in the mind and they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to unleash that and make </v>

3551
02:39:55.441 --> 02:39:59.910
<v Speaker 1>people understand what it is that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions do to other people and have them</v>

3552
02:39:59.911 --> 02:40:01.070
<v Speaker 1>feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3553
02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:03.420
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone doesn't feel empathy,</v>

3554
02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:05.850
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have any feelings for anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else other than themselves.</v>

3555
02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:06.953
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people amongst us that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they believe are just acting like they </v>

3556
02:40:10.081 --> 02:40:10.914
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're mimicking actual emotions </v>

3557
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:14.040
<v Speaker 1>and I think we've been around.</v>

3558
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:16.380
<v Speaker 2>I think you've probably been around </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like that and it's weird,</v>

3559
02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:17.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you'll,</v>

3560
02:40:17.171 --> 02:40:21.090
<v Speaker 2>they'll talk about something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some horrible tragedy and they have some</v>

3561
02:40:21.091 --> 02:40:21.924
<v Speaker 2>weird sort of disingenuous take on it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just very awkward and you're </v>

3562
02:40:26.701 --> 02:40:27.031
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3563
02:40:27.031 --> 02:40:28.260
<v Speaker 2>I think that guy's a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3564
02:40:28.261 --> 02:40:29.580
<v Speaker 2>And then you get out of there and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3565
02:40:29.581 --> 02:40:31.400
<v Speaker 2>I think we might've been around a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociopath.</v>

3566
02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:34.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that someone doesn't feel it.</v>

3567
02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:35.093
<v Speaker 2>They just don't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's something in the brain </v>

3568
02:40:36.241 --> 02:40:38.460
<v Speaker 2>that can be unlocked and we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminate that.</v>

3569
02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:40.830
<v Speaker 2>It might be as simple as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3570
02:40:40.831 --> 02:40:45.270
<v Speaker 2>like some people have asberger's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people have Alzheimer's,</v>

3571
02:40:45.280 --> 02:40:46.113
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe some people have a lack of </v>

3572
02:40:47.401 --> 02:40:48.930
<v Speaker 2>empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's a doorway.</v>

3573
02:40:48.970 --> 02:40:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure they've,</v>

3574
02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:52.610
<v Speaker 2>they're having some success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3575
02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:53.453
<v Speaker 2>this is anybody on the spectrum of </v>
<v Speaker 2>autism and asperger's empathy's in </v>

3576
02:40:57.320 --> 02:40:57.990
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3577
02:40:57.990 --> 02:40:58.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3578
02:40:58.801 --> 02:40:59.311
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3579
02:40:59.311 --> 02:41:02.070
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that is their mirror neurons </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't mirror owings,</v>

3580
02:41:02.130 --> 02:41:03.610
<v Speaker 2>so they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3581
02:41:03.940 --> 02:41:04.773
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last time I said that out loud in </v>

3582
02:41:05.731 --> 02:41:07.710
<v Speaker 2>public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got screamed at for a very,</v>

3583
02:41:07.711 --> 02:41:08.544
<v Speaker 2>very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody screamed at you seems to be </v>

3584
02:41:09.931 --> 02:41:10.930
<v Speaker 2>fairly well established.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

3585
02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:11.873
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a little bit about autism in a </v>

3586
02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:13.673
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>furry prayer and people whose people </v>

3587
02:41:15.361 --> 02:41:18.660
<v Speaker 2>really got upset when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I said,</v>

3588
02:41:18.710 --> 02:41:19.543
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things is going on with </v>

3589
02:41:20.101 --> 02:41:20.934
<v Speaker 2>autism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether we think is that your mirror </v>

3590
02:41:21.781 --> 02:41:24.830
<v Speaker 2>neurons are mirroring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

3591
02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:25.753
<v Speaker 2>you're not reading facial expressions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and emotions in people in that </v>

3592
02:41:28.741 --> 02:41:30.270
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got very upset with me.</v>

3593
02:41:30.540 --> 02:41:31.620
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3594
02:41:31.790 --> 02:41:35.490
<v Speaker 2>But it was this established science </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much at this point.</v>

3595
02:41:35.491 --> 02:41:38.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sexual was baron cone and you know,</v>

3596
02:41:38.240 --> 02:41:39.450
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a smart dude.</v>

3597
02:41:39.730 --> 02:41:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their take was,</v>

3598
02:41:41.581 --> 02:41:43.920
<v Speaker 2>I was wrong and I shouldn't be talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it in public.</v>

3599
02:41:44.100 --> 02:41:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Sacha Baron Cohen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the not,</v>

3600
02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:46.531
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3601
02:41:46.531 --> 02:41:46.981
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3602
02:41:46.981 --> 02:41:49.140
<v Speaker 2>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3603
02:41:49.141 --> 02:41:50.670
<v Speaker 2>not boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same name.</v>

3604
02:41:51.390 --> 02:41:53.520
<v Speaker 2>Neuroscientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was upset at you?</v>

3605
02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:54.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3606
02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:55.193
<v Speaker 2>He was the guy who did the research and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so he feels no people in the people in </v>

3607
02:41:59.341 --> 02:42:00.930
<v Speaker 2>that community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

3608
02:42:01.650 --> 02:42:05.760
<v Speaker 2>I got letters and email and things along</v>
<v Speaker 2>those lines.</v>

3609
02:42:05.761 --> 02:42:08.580
<v Speaker 2>People posted stuff online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were offended that I had.</v>

3610
02:42:08.670 --> 02:42:11.310
<v Speaker 2>I had written about their disease </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently.</v>

3611
02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:14.460
<v Speaker 2>Just because you had written about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't suffer from it.</v>

3612
02:42:14.610 --> 02:42:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3613
02:42:14.980 --> 02:42:15.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3614
02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:16.553
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're asking big why questions and I </v>

3615
02:42:18.351 --> 02:42:20.430
<v Speaker 2>can answer them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

3616
02:42:22.530 --> 02:42:24.030
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought so too.</v>

3617
02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:24.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if,</v>

3618
02:42:24.970 --> 02:42:25.803
<v Speaker 2>if some established neuroscientists has </v>
<v Speaker 2>made some sort of a connection between </v>

3619
02:42:28.951 --> 02:42:31.800
<v Speaker 2>that issue and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to discuss it.</v>

3620
02:42:31.801 --> 02:42:33.880
<v Speaker 2>That seems really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

3621
02:42:34.160 --> 02:42:36.030
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of that garden room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3622
02:42:36.031 --> 02:42:40.050
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that going around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's also a,</v>

3623
02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:42.620
<v Speaker 2>obviously they call it the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3624
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:43.690
<v Speaker 2>for a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3625
02:42:43.710 --> 02:42:44.543
<v Speaker 2>when you say someone's on the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know people that are probably </v>

3626
02:42:47.461 --> 02:42:48.294
<v Speaker 2>mildly autistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I know some folks that are just </v>

3627
02:42:50.700 --> 02:42:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Gonzo full blown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3628
02:42:53.430 --> 02:42:54.880
<v Speaker 2>so the prop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3629
02:42:55.110 --> 02:42:55.943
<v Speaker 2>it's some people that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't recognize that in themselves </v>

3630
02:42:58.081 --> 02:43:01.370
<v Speaker 2>or maybe they don't want to admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3631
02:43:01.380 --> 02:43:04.550
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot of time in silicon valley </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's a lot of that,</v>

3632
02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:05.800
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3633
02:43:05.820 --> 02:43:09.440
<v Speaker 2>in fact normally used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3634
02:43:09.450 --> 02:43:11.320
<v Speaker 2>if you were on the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't</v>

3635
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:13.750
<v Speaker 3>procreating as much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3636
02:43:14.080 --> 02:43:16.420
<v Speaker 3>But in Silicon Valley they're rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're rich,</v>

3637
02:43:16.450 --> 02:43:20.280
<v Speaker 3>they're on the spectrum and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>banging hot up there.</v>

3638
02:43:20.330 --> 02:43:21.163
<v Speaker 3>A couple of nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's one autistic people are having </v>

3639
02:43:22.691 --> 02:43:25.960
<v Speaker 3>sex with other autistic animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the places we're looking at their</v>

3640
02:43:25.961 --> 02:43:28.000
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting question because one</v>

3641
02:43:28.001 --> 02:43:28.420
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3642
02:43:28.420 --> 02:43:32.530
<v Speaker 3>one of the questions that this raises is</v>
<v Speaker 3>will it start to splinter the species?</v>

3643
02:43:32.531 --> 02:43:34.420
<v Speaker 3>Are we looking when that starts </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening,</v>

3644
02:43:34.450 --> 02:43:35.283
<v Speaker 3>are you looking at a new that like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first step towards something because </v>

3645
02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:43.570
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely something going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently in their brains.</v>

3646
02:43:43.571 --> 02:43:44.404
<v Speaker 3>They can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all kinds of superpowers and </v>

3647
02:43:45.701 --> 02:43:48.160
<v Speaker 3>there's all kinds of limitations right </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

3648
02:43:48.840 --> 02:43:49.540
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3649
02:43:49.540 --> 02:43:52.300
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't take much to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>speciation.</v>

3650
02:43:52.520 --> 02:43:53.353
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3651
02:43:53.750 --> 02:43:55.850
<v Speaker 1>totally a good point because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>

3652
02:43:55.851 --> 02:43:56.684
<v Speaker 1>at one point in time we had to develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions and empathy in order to unite </v>

3653
02:44:00.741 --> 02:44:03.500
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and to stayed together </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected in the community.</v>

3654
02:44:03.830 --> 02:44:05.780
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other animals don't have that.</v>

3655
02:44:05.781 --> 02:44:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Like ants don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the,</v>

3656
02:44:07.790 --> 02:44:08.830
<v Speaker 1>as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3657
02:44:08.900 --> 02:44:09.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3658
02:44:09.650 --> 02:44:10.483
<v Speaker 1>they seem to be pretty robotic and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>also don't have any free will </v>

3659
02:44:12.831 --> 02:44:13.664
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why they have those crazy aunt </v>

3660
02:44:15.261 --> 02:44:18.020
<v Speaker 1>spirals where they never seen the ant </v>
<v Speaker 1>death spiral.</v>

3661
02:44:18.270 --> 02:44:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Never seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is the female,</v>

3662
02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:22.273
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another we'll get separated </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the rest of the colony and the </v>

3663
02:44:26.151 --> 02:44:30.620
<v Speaker 1>males are still trying to follow the </v>
<v Speaker 1>female scent and they can't follow it.</v>

3664
02:44:30.621 --> 02:44:31.454
<v Speaker 1>So they're following each other and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow each other and what looks like a </v>

3665
02:44:33.561 --> 02:44:37.190
<v Speaker 1>hurricane where there's an eye of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurricane and the center and it's an ant</v>

3666
02:44:37.191 --> 02:44:39.050
<v Speaker 1>death spiral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that right there.</v>

3667
02:44:39.780 --> 02:44:40.613
<v Speaker 1>See though they're spinning around in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>circle and they will do that until they </v>

3668
02:44:42.981 --> 02:44:44.660
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3669
02:44:44.750 --> 02:44:45.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't find the female for the </v>

3670
02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:47.233
<v Speaker 1>Queen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't find the queen and they're </v>

3671
02:44:48.621 --> 02:44:51.530
<v Speaker 1>confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some sort of a disruption in the</v>

3672
02:44:51.531 --> 02:44:53.390
<v Speaker 1>signal that they get the pheromones that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've.</v>

3673
02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:56.630
<v Speaker 1>They're getting and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering around all fucking crazy.</v>

3674
02:44:56.930 --> 02:44:59.010
<v Speaker 1>And the ones in that center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that.</v>

3675
02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:02.780
<v Speaker 1>That mimics exactly what a hurricane </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like.</v>

3676
02:45:02.820 --> 02:45:03.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3677
02:45:04.780 --> 02:45:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

3678
02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Non Empathetic.</v>

3679
02:45:08.201 --> 02:45:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Little no fucking free will have in </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitches who do you to circle?</v>

3680
02:45:11.890 --> 02:45:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're important here in an hater.</v>

3681
02:45:13.780 --> 02:45:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lover of ants because without them</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be alive.</v>

3682
02:45:16.421 --> 02:45:17.254
<v Speaker 1>I'm just joking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's as much biomass of ants as all </v>

3683
02:45:20.921 --> 02:45:22.780
<v Speaker 1>the other animals combined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome,</v>

3684
02:45:22.781 --> 02:45:23.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of that.</v>

3685
02:45:24.460 --> 02:45:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are.</v>

3686
02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:28.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they exist alongside us,</v>

3687
02:45:28.601 --> 02:45:30.700
<v Speaker 1>but they have completely different rules</v>
<v Speaker 1>of engagement.</v>

3688
02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:31.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

3689
02:45:31.961 --> 02:45:36.280
<v Speaker 1>their world is very strange and almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like mechanical.</v>

3690
02:45:36.550 --> 02:45:40.270
<v Speaker 1>They're almost like some weird bio </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms,</v>

3691
02:45:40.300 --> 02:45:42.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

3692
02:45:42.290 --> 02:45:43.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a collective consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3693
02:45:43.901 --> 02:45:46.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a shared consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

3694
02:45:46.830 --> 02:45:47.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3695
02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:51.330
<v Speaker 1>how do you even Grok that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you get your head around that?</v>

3696
02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our little world,</v>

3697
02:45:53.521 --> 02:45:55.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3698
02:45:55.381 --> 02:45:56.970
<v Speaker 1>but we step on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't mind,</v>

3699
02:45:57.330 --> 02:45:57.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

3700
02:45:57.871 --> 02:45:59.560
<v Speaker 1>there's so little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't mind squishing them.</v>

3701
02:45:59.980 --> 02:46:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Like you can squish them in your kitchen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just brush them off your pants.</v>

3702
02:46:03.300 --> 02:46:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Like if you kill an ant on your pants </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your kitchen,</v>

3703
02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:08.910
<v Speaker 1>like most people don't pick that fucker </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and he just let it drop to the,</v>

3704
02:46:10.580 --> 02:46:12.590
<v Speaker 1>to the proper burial you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3705
02:46:12.591 --> 02:46:13.424
<v Speaker 1>You don't dig a hole and say your </v>
<v Speaker 1>prayers and light a candle and put up a </v>

3706
02:46:16.461 --> 02:46:18.070
<v Speaker 1>picture of the amt before it died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3707
02:46:18.260 --> 02:46:20.150
<v Speaker 1>be weird if I did that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would.</v>

3708
02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:22.730
<v Speaker 1>But there's a certain size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you,</v>

3709
02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:27.380
<v Speaker 1>if you kill the tiniest little Gnat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not really gonna do anything with</v>

3710
02:46:27.381 --> 02:46:29.570
<v Speaker 1>the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you stop a rat,</v>

3711
02:46:29.940 --> 02:46:31.580
<v Speaker 1>he had to clean that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can dispose it.</v>

3712
02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:32.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

3713
02:46:32.301 --> 02:46:33.134
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3714
02:46:33.770 --> 02:46:35.060
<v Speaker 1>there's a line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3715
02:46:35.061 --> 02:46:35.894
<v Speaker 1>there's lines is a biomass line where </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals become like super significant </v>

3716
02:46:40.071 --> 02:46:40.970
<v Speaker 1>and important to us.</v>

3717
02:46:42.610 --> 02:46:46.720
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think it's totally size related?</v>

3718
02:46:46.780 --> 02:46:50.410
<v Speaker 1>It's some of it's size related,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a appearance.</v>

3719
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:55.030
<v Speaker 1>We like little cute mice more than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>like big fucking scary spiders.</v>

3720
02:46:55.440 --> 02:46:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Is he a big scary spider?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crush that fucker with a hammer.</v>

3721
02:46:58.340 --> 02:47:00.120
<v Speaker 1>And I really liked spiders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3722
02:47:00.430 --> 02:47:02.830
<v Speaker 1>One of those weird guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3723
02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:03.753
<v Speaker 1>I mean most people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people suffer from at least some </v>

3724
02:47:06.041 --> 02:47:06.874
<v Speaker 1>form of Arachnophobia where they see </v>
<v Speaker 1>some creepy spider walking tours and be </v>

3725
02:47:09.421 --> 02:47:10.254
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

3726
02:47:10.420 --> 02:47:12.160
<v Speaker 1>because not a lot of spiders will kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3727
02:47:12.460 --> 02:47:13.293
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go specifically out hunting for like </v>

3728
02:47:15.641 --> 02:47:19.170
<v Speaker 1>the Tarantula migrations in New Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really know when that's going on?</v>

3729
02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:21.250
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool if you've never seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3730
02:47:21.370 --> 02:47:23.470
<v Speaker 1>you can see if you go to pinnacle's </v>
<v Speaker 1>National Monument,</v>

3731
02:47:23.471 --> 02:47:26.350
<v Speaker 1>which is up kind of around Gilroy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3732
02:47:26.590 --> 02:47:28.720
<v Speaker 1>you can see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have trashed on migrations up there</v>

3733
02:47:28.721 --> 02:47:29.620
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's amazing.</v>

3734
02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Just huge column.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of them?</v>

3735
02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:35.500
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of Tarantulas.</v>

3736
02:47:36.730 --> 02:47:39.460
<v Speaker 1>You freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie has got a rack to phobia.</v>

3737
02:47:39.461 --> 02:47:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's covered his mouth through.</v>

3738
02:47:40.900 --> 02:47:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Throw up who that he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you've seen a vampire.</v>

3739
02:47:43.780 --> 02:47:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Did you pull up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pull up a tranche.</v>

3740
02:47:45.730 --> 02:47:48.910
<v Speaker 1>The migration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's terrified.</v>

3741
02:47:48.940 --> 02:47:49.773
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's literally covering his mouth like </v>

3742
02:47:51.191 --> 02:47:52.360
<v Speaker 1>they're pulling out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cross on them.</v>

3743
02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:57.180
<v Speaker 1>My favorite spiders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Brazilian wondering spider.</v>

3744
02:47:57.181 --> 02:48:00.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't want that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It bites you.</v>

3745
02:48:00.820 --> 02:48:01.653
<v Speaker 1>It stings you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it gives you a raging hard on that </v>

3746
02:48:05.161 --> 02:48:07.800
<v Speaker 1>will kill you and if it doesn't kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3747
02:48:07.830 --> 02:48:11.790
<v Speaker 1>your Dick is broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll it will break your sexuality will</v>

3748
02:48:11.791 --> 02:48:14.860
<v Speaker 1>literally wreck your Dick like a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>ballpark,</v>

3749
02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:17.250

<v Speaker 1>that you left on a on a,</v>

3750
02:48:17.790 --> 02:48:19.830
<v Speaker 1>on a grill for too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know they plump.</v>

3751
02:48:19.831 --> 02:48:20.970
<v Speaker 1>When you cook them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they pop.</v>

02:48:53.731 --> 02:48:54.564
<v Speaker 1>muscles in your body.</v>

<v Speaker 1>nitric or nitrix one of those and did a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3770
02:49:03.271 --> 02:49:06.150
<v Speaker 1>the same sort of stuff that exists in,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

3776
02:49:14.100 --> 02:49:18.900
<v Speaker 1>That nitric oxide has some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on muscles and it's also the same</v>

3777
02:49:18.901 --> 02:49:21.090
<v Speaker 1>sort of an effect that you get from </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a Viagra,</v>

3778
02:49:21.091 --> 02:49:24.360
<v Speaker 1>which is why those vasodilators are </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal in the Olympics.</v>

3779
02:49:24.750 --> 02:49:29.100
<v Speaker 1>You can't take Viagra has a performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancing effect on muscular.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Muscular.</v>

3781
02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:31.890
<v Speaker 1>That's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3782
02:49:32.100 --> 02:49:34.540
<v Speaker 1>It's illegal in the Olympics.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm by Agra.</v>

3784
02:49:35.581 --> 02:49:36.414
<v Speaker 1>It actually enhances endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason why you get so much </v>

3785
02:49:39.030 --> 02:49:41.560
<v Speaker 1>blood flow to your penis is because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3786
02:49:41.630 --> 02:49:44.280
<v Speaker 1>you just got this crazy blood flow </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout all your muscles,</v>

3787
02:49:44.281 --> 02:49:46.290
<v Speaker 1>so it gives you more strength and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>endurance.</v>

3788
02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:47.593
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much of it is digital </v>

3790
02:49:50.590 --> 02:49:52.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to look into it.</v>

3791
02:49:52.890 --> 02:49:57.170
<v Speaker 1>But this Brazilian wondering spider </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently that times a fucking thousand</v>

<v Speaker 3>She's a macarthur genius award winning </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservationists.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She helped start a to on a national park</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Madagascar and they had these huge </v>

3797
02:50:12.700 --> 02:50:15.370
<v Speaker 3>hairy spiders in moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found a national park.</v>

<v Speaker 3>How big you are showing me like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>football.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>

3803
02:50:30.701 --> 02:50:33.310
<v Speaker 3>we're in the right vicinity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're harmless though.</v>

3804
02:50:33.430 --> 02:50:36.370
<v Speaker 3>There's no docks in two minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna kill him.</v>

3805
02:50:36.371 --> 02:50:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was dumped on them.</v>

3806
02:50:39.170 --> 02:50:40.420
<v Speaker 3>There was a researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was at,</v>

3807
02:50:40.450 --> 02:50:41.283
<v Speaker 3>I want to say she was at Duke at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and one of the researchers there </v>

3808
02:50:43.871 --> 02:50:45.140
<v Speaker 3>asked if she would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3809
02:50:45.160 --> 02:50:50.160
<v Speaker 3>kind of bring these spiders back for her</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do some research on and a hat,</v>

3810
02:50:52.050 --> 02:50:55.150
<v Speaker 3>kind of fill the container with it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was under her seat on the airplane.</v>

3811
02:50:55.180 --> 02:50:56.013
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's wearing a skirt and she </v>

3812
02:50:57.231 --> 02:50:58.064
<v Speaker 3>sitting on the airplane and she suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 3>starts to feel something walking up her </v>

3813
02:51:02.471 --> 02:51:05.710
<v Speaker 3>skirt and she's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She looks down.</v>

3814
02:51:05.720 --> 02:51:06.760
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

3818
02:51:15.210 --> 02:51:16.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she got arrested.</v>

3819
02:51:16.600 --> 02:51:18.490
<v Speaker 2>She got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got them all back in.</v>

3820
02:51:19.250 --> 02:51:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Think it was like eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We get small.</v>

3850
02:52:37.260 --> 02:52:38.093
<v Speaker 1>Probably probably like some 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moving 60 zap array or something that </v>

3867
02:53:22.851 --> 02:53:25.230
<v Speaker 3>These are all dangers that come with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3868
02:53:25.320 --> 02:53:27.860
<v Speaker 3>exploring aneurysm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>overindulgence over indulgence,</v>

3869
02:53:27.861 --> 02:53:28.694
<v Speaker 3>but commercialization to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the same impulses can be really </v>

3870
02:53:31.731 --> 02:53:33.620
<v Speaker 3>harnessed to sell us stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3871
02:53:34.730 --> 02:53:35.450
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

3872
02:53:35.450 --> 02:53:37.760
<v Speaker 1>is there also an issue in </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercialization in the same issue that</v>

3873
02:53:37.770 --> 02:53:38.603
<v Speaker 1>has been with opiates?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Opiates have a real benefit for people </v>

3874
02:53:40.381 --> 02:53:41.214
<v Speaker 1>that are in chronic pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've been sold so many times and </v>

3875
02:53:44.431 --> 02:53:45.264
<v Speaker 1>they're so available and so over </v>
<v Speaker 1>prescribed that you're dealing with is </v>

3876
02:53:48.301 --> 02:53:50.340
<v Speaker 1>massive amount of people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>addictions to them.</v>

3877
02:53:50.341 --> 02:53:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

3878
02:53:50.650 --> 02:53:52.000
<v Speaker 3>we're living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just put it this way,</v>

3879
02:53:52.001 --> 02:53:54.320
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things we tell people,</v>

3880
02:53:54.880 --> 02:53:57.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the flow genome project is don't ever go</v>

3881
02:53:57.191 --> 02:53:58.024
<v Speaker 3>shopping in a flow state because you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>got massively heightened pattern </v>

3882
02:54:01.481 --> 02:54:02.314
<v Speaker 3>recognition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>information processing and everything </v>

3883
02:54:04.061 --> 02:54:05.300
<v Speaker 3>looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna,</v>

3884
02:54:05.410 --> 02:54:08.050
<v Speaker 3>you're going to write it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can get very,</v>

3885
02:54:08.051 --> 02:54:10.390
<v Speaker 3>very expensive like going to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>supermarket when you're hungry,</v>

3886
02:54:10.420 --> 02:54:11.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same sort of thing.</v>

3887
02:54:11.741 --> 02:54:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Everything looks great on you and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3888
02:54:14.990 --> 02:54:17.290
<v Speaker 3>because it's optimal performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel great,</v>

3889
02:54:17.291 --> 02:54:19.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's in those,</v>

3890
02:54:19.780 --> 02:54:22.510
<v Speaker 3>we can abuse those for commercial ends </v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

3891
02:54:22.511 --> 02:54:25.120
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3892
02:54:26.020 --> 02:54:30.550
<v Speaker 3>this is not wild speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A two or three years ago,</v>

3893
02:54:30.580 --> 02:54:34.720
<v Speaker 3>the flow genome project presented the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Advertising Research Foundation,</v>

3894
02:54:34.721 --> 02:54:35.554
<v Speaker 3>which is a collection of pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 3>every major media and ad company in the </v>

3895
02:54:39.881 --> 02:54:40.714
<v Speaker 3>world and they brought us in to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about kind of flow and advertising and </v>

3896
02:54:44.861 --> 02:54:48.450
<v Speaker 3>could you start to harness non ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 3>states of consciousness as to,</v>

3897
02:54:48.540 --> 02:54:49.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive buying behavior.</v>

3898
02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:51.580
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

3899
02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:53.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're,</v>

3900
02:54:53.590 --> 02:54:54.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3901
02:54:54.250 --> 02:54:57.400
<v Speaker 3>this stuff requires a massive amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

3902
02:54:57.401 --> 02:55:02.401
<v Speaker 3>We feel that open source in the research</v>
<v Speaker 3>and open sourcing the exploration is,</v>

3903
02:55:03.100 --> 02:55:07.190
<v Speaker 3>is the best way to kind of keep it free </v>
<v Speaker 3>and tamp down those impulses.</v>

3904
02:55:07.460 --> 02:55:09.170
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but ultimately I,</v>

3905
02:55:09.220 --> 02:55:11.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do I think it's going is I,</v>

3906
02:55:11.571 --> 02:55:12.404
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think most of the skills that we need </v>

3907
02:55:15.171 --> 02:55:17.930
<v Speaker 3>in the 21st century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's kind of,</v>

3908
02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:19.460
<v Speaker 3>as I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with trauma,</v>

3909
02:55:19.461 --> 02:55:20.294
<v Speaker 3>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of things or create the </v>

3910
02:55:22.251 --> 02:55:25.820
<v Speaker 3>heights of creativity and cooperation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that stuff.</v>

3911
02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:27.193
<v Speaker 3>Those are best accessed through altered </v>
<v Speaker 3>states of consciousness during non </v>

3912
02:55:30.771 --> 02:55:32.480
<v Speaker 3>ordinary states of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a sense.</v>

3913
02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:36.980
<v Speaker 3>These are the tools evolution gave us </v>
<v Speaker 3>for ultimate performance and I think,</v>

3914
02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:38.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's,</v>

3915
02:55:38.720 --> 02:55:40.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes for a long time we didn't have</v>

3916
02:55:40.491 --> 02:55:42.500
<v Speaker 3>the science to understand what was all </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on with.</v>

3917
02:55:42.500 --> 02:55:45.530
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole bunch of kind of moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues that got layered on top of it.</v>

3918
02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:48.860
<v Speaker 3>I think some of the moral issues are </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting kind of peeled back in.</v>

3919
02:55:48.861 --> 02:55:49.694
<v Speaker 3>The science is showing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think we're gonna see a huge kind </v>

3920
02:55:52.900 --> 02:55:55.760
<v Speaker 3>of revolution in this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you look at the numbers,</v>

3921
02:55:55.761 --> 02:55:57.980
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just talking about flow,</v>

3922
02:55:58.310 --> 02:55:59.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending on,</v>

3923
02:56:00.260 --> 02:56:02.360
<v Speaker 3>we talked about this crazy boost and </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning,</v>

3924
02:56:02.361 --> 02:56:03.194
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that Darpa and advanced brain </v>

3925
02:56:04.521 --> 02:56:05.354
<v Speaker 3>monitoring achieved with it with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>military 400 to $400 or 230 to 500 </v>

3926
02:56:10.911 --> 02:56:13.160
<v Speaker 3>percent increase in accelerated </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning.</v>

3927
02:56:13.460 --> 02:56:17.060
<v Speaker 3>You see a similar spike in motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see a similar spike in creativity.</v>

3928
02:56:17.380 --> 02:56:19.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3929
02:56:19.490 --> 02:56:21.710
<v Speaker 3>these are huge step functions </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference,</v>

3930
02:56:21.711 --> 02:56:22.544
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're in self help and I can get a </v>

3931
02:56:24.081 --> 02:56:27.500
<v Speaker 3>five percent improvement over like six </v>
<v Speaker 3>months and it'll stick.</v>

3932
02:56:27.740 --> 02:56:29.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a miracle.</v>

3933
02:56:29.181 --> 02:56:30.040
<v Speaker 3>It's giant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3934
02:56:30.050 --> 02:56:31.820
<v Speaker 3>It's giant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're talking about,</v>

3935
02:56:32.030 --> 02:56:34.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>creativity spiking 400 percent.</v>

3936
02:56:34.491 --> 02:56:35.324
<v Speaker 3>And it's not even just in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Teresa Amabile at Harvard discovered </v>

3937
02:56:38.061 --> 02:56:41.510
<v Speaker 3>that the heightened creativity that </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows up in a flow state can outlast the</v>

3938
02:56:41.511 --> 02:56:43.130
<v Speaker 3>flow state by a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes two days,</v>

3939
02:56:43.131 --> 02:56:45.140
<v Speaker 3>and it suggests more research needs to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be done.</v>

3940
02:56:45.410 --> 02:56:46.243
<v Speaker 3>But it suggests that flow actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>rewires the brain to think more </v>

3941
02:56:48.831 --> 02:56:49.664
<v Speaker 3>creatively overtime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is amazing because it's really </v>

3942
02:56:51.951 --> 02:56:52.784
<v Speaker 3>hard to train people up in creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're not talking about a five </v>

3943
02:56:55.131 --> 02:56:55.964
<v Speaker 3>percent increase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about a to a step </v>

3944
02:56:57.921 --> 02:56:58.754
<v Speaker 3>function worth a difference and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just starting to kind of tap it into </v>

3945
02:57:01.251 --> 02:57:02.330
<v Speaker 3>this function,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3946
02:57:02.331 --> 02:57:03.164
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure you've had similar </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations with the people in the </v>

3947
02:57:05.481 --> 02:57:06.314
<v Speaker 3>high performance world about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anybody you talk to has done much </v>

3948
02:57:09.741 --> 02:57:12.040
<v Speaker 3>work on high performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will tell you we think we've,</v>

3949
02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:12.913
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tap five percent of what we know and </v>

3950
02:57:14.721 --> 02:57:15.800
<v Speaker 3>what's actually possible.</v>

3951
02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:16.461
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3952
02:57:16.461 --> 02:57:17.294
<v Speaker 3>I think what's coming is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly exciting and incredibly </v>

3953
02:57:19.641 --> 02:57:20.670
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's that?</v>

3954
02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:23.510
<v Speaker 3>How's that for a final test where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking nailed it,</v>

3955
02:57:23.511 --> 02:57:24.980
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just knocked it out of the park.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Thank you so much for coming on here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where,</v>

3957
02:57:27.960 --> 02:57:30.320
<v Speaker 3>where can people get Ahold of you?</v>

<v Speaker 3>You can find me@StevenKotler.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>S T E v e n k o t l e r Dot com.</v>

3961
02:57:40.670 --> 02:57:44.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm Steven Underscore Kotler on twitter </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm really responsive on twitter.</v>

3962
02:57:44.871 --> 02:57:46.970
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to follow me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to ask me questions,</v>

3963
02:57:46.971 --> 02:57:50.000
<v Speaker 3>whatever are flow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>genome project.com.</v>

3964
02:57:50.001 --> 02:57:53.840
<v Speaker 3>One resource I want to give people is if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to the flow genome project,</v>

3965
02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:54.993
<v Speaker 3>a.com,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a free flow profile of the </v>

3966
02:57:56.611 --> 02:58:01.070
<v Speaker 3>anybody can take and it basically says </v>
<v Speaker 3>if your trait tology says if you're this</v>

3967
02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:01.913
<v Speaker 3>kind of person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're likely to find flow in the </v>

3968
02:58:04.241 --> 02:58:04.690
<v Speaker 3>instruction.</v>

3969
02:58:04.690 --> 02:58:07.500
<v Speaker 3>So you asked what's the easiest entrance</v>
<v Speaker 3>place for people?</v>

3970
02:58:07.830 --> 02:58:10.470
<v Speaker 3>The flow profiles are really easy </v>
<v Speaker 3>entrance place.</v>

3971
02:58:10.471 --> 02:58:15.270
<v Speaker 3>It'll tell you what direction to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And and it's actually interesting point.</v>

3972
02:58:15.650 --> 02:58:18.110
<v Speaker 3>It's become one of the largest studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>that anybody's ever run.</v>

3973
02:58:18.111 --> 02:58:19.950
<v Speaker 3>An optimal psych.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sort of happened accidentally.</v>

3974
02:58:19.951 --> 02:58:20.784
<v Speaker 3>We didn't expect to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like 40 some thousand people have </v>

3975
02:58:22.741 --> 02:58:25.560
<v Speaker 3>taken this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the weird fact that I will leave you</v>

3976
02:58:25.561 --> 02:58:28.830
<v Speaker 3>with is even though we normally </v>
<v Speaker 3>associate flow with athletic achievement</v>

3977
02:58:28.831 --> 02:58:31.680
<v Speaker 3>or artistic achievement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority of our respondents,</v>

3978
02:58:31.681 --> 02:58:34.980
<v Speaker 3>I think it's 47 percent of our study </v>
<v Speaker 3>group find the most flow.</v>

3979
02:58:34.981 --> 02:58:36.870
<v Speaker 3>They fall into what we call the deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinker category.</v>

3980
