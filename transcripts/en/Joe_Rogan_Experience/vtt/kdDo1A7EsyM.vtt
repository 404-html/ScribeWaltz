00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are really reluctant to give up</v>

2
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.990
<v Speaker 1>fun shit like lying and driving their</v>
<v Speaker 1>car fast like those two things.</v>

3
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Speaker 1>People are gonna have a hard time with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4
00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:14.770
<v Speaker 1>like actually getting into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into their mind,</v>

5
00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:17.920
<v Speaker 1>seeing their actual mind and being able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that so we can know without a</v>

6
00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:19.930
<v Speaker 1>doubt whether or not someone's guilty or</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent.</v>

7
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.800
<v Speaker 1>But my question to you is if you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>get inside someone's mind and it was</v>

8
00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:28.801
<v Speaker 1>like that really super.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a suggestive guy they were talking</v>

9
00:00:29.711 --> 00:00:33.490
<v Speaker 1>about earlier that just confessed all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horrific demonic possession stuff</v>

10
00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:36.790
<v Speaker 1>and eating babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it's like getting to that guy's</v>

11
00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:38.350
<v Speaker 1>mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you can't tell?</v>

12
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.733
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

13
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 3>be the case that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that worries me,</v>

14
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 3>and this is perhaps an inept segue to</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

15
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 3>but the um,</v>

16
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.970
<v Speaker 3>in people's minds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you get,</v>

17
00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 3>you get someone talking long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know their minds.</v>

18
00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:01.681
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

19
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:05.450
<v Speaker 3>they can only conceal what they're about</v>
<v Speaker 3>a only so.</v>

20
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:08.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can because you're a super smart</v>

21
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 3>wizard type.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

22
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.610
<v Speaker 3>but Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

23
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:13.940
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know if he's a mind reader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the question is what will people</v>

24
00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:14.870
<v Speaker 3>care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

25
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:17.000
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have,</v>

26
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.840
<v Speaker 3>we don't even need a lie detector.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have someone who's openly line,</v>

27
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.790
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

28
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.200
<v Speaker 3>who just gets caught in lies again and</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

29
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.750
<v Speaker 3>you could see it too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel it,</v>

30
00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:29.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But people don't seem to care right in,</v>

31
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.540
<v Speaker 3>at least in the political process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm thinking in this case of trump</v>

32
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.570
<v Speaker 3>where you have someone who is in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some cases line or just changing his</v>

33
00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:43.901
<v Speaker 3>mind in such an incoherent way that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

34
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.280
<v Speaker 3>it's the functional equivalent of line.</v>

35
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's someone who becomes totally</v>

36
00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:51.410
<v Speaker 3>unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a stance that is a on Tuesday and</v>

37
00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 3>it's be on Wednesday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when the discrepancy is pointed out,</v>

38
00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:57.500
<v Speaker 3>he tells her to go fuck yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

39
00:01:57.501 --> 00:01:58.700
<v Speaker 3>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just no,</v>

40
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.510
<v Speaker 3>there is no accountability to his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his own states of consciousness that</v>

41
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.170
<v Speaker 3>he's going to be held to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the people who love him don't seem</v>

42
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:10.040
<v Speaker 3>to care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually,</v>

43
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.060
<v Speaker 3>in as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know so many of these people</v>

44
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:17.570
<v Speaker 3>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but from based on social media and</v>

45
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:21.410
<v Speaker 3>seeing a few articles where someone has</v>
<v Speaker 3>explained why they love trump.</v>

46
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 3>People view this as a kind of this sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this dishonesty,</v>

47
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:30.950
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my view,</v>

48
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.040
<v Speaker 3>both dishonesty and a kind of a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>theatrical hucksterism.</v>

49
00:02:37.071 --> 00:02:40.610
<v Speaker 3>I started sort of person who's who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretending to be many things that he</v>

50
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:41.444
<v Speaker 3>probably hasn't.</v>

51
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.690
<v Speaker 3>They see it as a new kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>authenticity,</v>

52
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.733
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this guy,</v>

53
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.160
<v Speaker 3>he's just letting it rip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't care what what is true.</v>

54
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:51.800
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't care what your expectations</v>
<v Speaker 3>for coherence are.</v>

55
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.800
<v Speaker 3>He's just going to tell you to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself every which way.</v>

56
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 3>And this is the new way of being honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

57
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 3>This is a new form of into integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing to watch.</v>

58
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's getting.</v>

59
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 3>It has been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm someone who actually,</v>

60
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 3>I remember on my own podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I was talking to Paul Bloom,</v>

61
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.900
<v Speaker 3>this psychologist who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's great and we had taught.</v>

62
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.140
<v Speaker 3>We got into politics and this is at</v>
<v Speaker 3>least a year ago,</v>

63
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 3>but at that point I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way we're going to be talking</v>

64
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 3>about trump in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

65
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 3>this is kind of completely flame out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was.</v>

66
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 3>This is A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't tend to make predictions,</v>

67
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 3>but this was a clear moment that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember making a prediction,</v>

68
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 3>which is now obviously false,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just couldn't imagine it that this</v>

69
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:38.821
<v Speaker 3>was where people were going to find this</v>
<v Speaker 3>compelling enough to for for him to be</v>

70
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the cusp of getting elected.</v>

71
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is terrifying.</v>

72
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 3>Have you taught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you taught this issue to death on</v>

73
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 3>your podcast or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess we kind of have.</v>

74
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is how everybody feels.</v>

75
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Everybody feels like you're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like with their person,</v>

76
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.320
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Bernie or whether it's for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary or whether you're a trump</v>

77
00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:59.720
<v Speaker 1>supporter or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have to be all in,</v>

78
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.290
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at the choices that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're given,</v>

79
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.050
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of these kids really be described</v>

80
00:04:06.051 --> 00:04:06.821
<v Speaker 1>as ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

81
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:08.090
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Hillary Clinton.</v>

82
00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:11.420
<v Speaker 1>You could want a woman in the White</v>
<v Speaker 1>House and you want to want to show</v>

83
00:04:11.421 --> 00:04:14.540
<v Speaker 1>everyone that a woman can do that job</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as well as a man and she's got the</v>

84
00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:16.970
<v Speaker 1>most experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She certainly has the most experience</v>

85
00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:19.880
<v Speaker 1>dealing with foreign governments and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly has the most experience in</v>

86
00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:21.870
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can make an easy,</v>

87
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>but she's also involved in to criminal</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigations.</v>

88
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:30.181
<v Speaker 1>She had an observer and her bathroom</v>
<v Speaker 1>squirrely stuff going on like,</v>

89
00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:32.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's.</v>

90
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.380
<v Speaker 1>She's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In many ways.</v>

91
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 1>She was gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2013 and then wouldn't admit the change</v>

92
00:04:39.741 --> 00:04:42.830
<v Speaker 1>of mind either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a politician,</v>

93
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.580
<v Speaker 1>she's a brilliant woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's also set in her ways and a</v>

94
00:04:46.581 --> 00:04:49.340
<v Speaker 1>politician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a politician to the end and part of</v>

95
00:04:49.341 --> 00:04:51.980
<v Speaker 1>being a politician has been a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>huckster.</v>

96
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.290
<v Speaker 1>You got to be able to get those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see your side and the way you do that</v>

97
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 1>is to talk like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't talk like a normal person</v>

98
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.980
<v Speaker 1>needs a speech coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all do.</v>

99
00:05:03.981 --> 00:05:06.830
<v Speaker 1>He's terrible to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump's not even good at it and he</v>

100
00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:07.970
<v Speaker 1>kicked their asses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

101
00:05:07.971 --> 00:05:09.350
<v Speaker 1>but who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but her voice or she.</v>

102
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.040
<v Speaker 1>She has a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use the sexist trope,</v>

103
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.950
<v Speaker 1>she has a shrill voice when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get her</v>

104
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.590
<v Speaker 3>in front of a mic and there's a crowd</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she thinks she's talking over the</v>

105
00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:21.030
<v Speaker 3>crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he doesn't have to do because</v>

106
00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:24.600
<v Speaker 3>she's in front of a mic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sound you get is just,</v>

107
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.570
<v Speaker 3>it's his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's yelling when she doesn't need to</v>

108
00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 3>yell at someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone has to teach her how to dial</v>

109
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 3>that back.</v>

110
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>What you just did is called</v>
<v Speaker 1>mansplaining.</v>

111
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm explaining to the men and her crew</v>
<v Speaker 1>who should,</v>

112
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.440
<v Speaker 1>who should talk some sense into her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she is,</v>

113
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 1>she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a bad candidate,</v>

114
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no doubt that she's</v>

115
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.180
<v Speaker 3>very smart and she's well informed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's qualified and she is absolutely</v>

116
00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:51.860
<v Speaker 3>who I will vote for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given the choices.</v>

117
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

118
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 3>I totally understand people's with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a liar.</v>

119
00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:03.430
<v Speaker 3>She's an opportunist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's just almost preternaturally and</v>

120
00:06:03.431 --> 00:06:04.221
<v Speaker 3>authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

121
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 3>she's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she will just focus group every third</v>

122
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:09.710
<v Speaker 3>sentence and you feel that from her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

123
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is all true.</v>

124
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 3>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also believe that people who say I've</v>

125
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 3>never met her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people who know her and I've met her</v>

126
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 3>say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

127
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 3>behind closed doors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

128
00:06:18.321 --> 00:06:21.120
<v Speaker 3>one on one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's incredibly impressive and,</v>

129
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.220
<v Speaker 3>and great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

130
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't translate into her</v>
<v Speaker 3>candidacy.</v>

131
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 3>She probably thinks she has to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Old School,</v>

132
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

133
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:31.010
<v Speaker 3>the way she's doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she,</v>

134
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is,</v>

135
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.790
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the,</v>

136
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 3>what's worked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what worries me?</v>

137
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 3>So I went on facebook the other day and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've said very little about this,</v>

138
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:44.870
<v Speaker 3>but I've made enough noise is sort that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just made that people understand that</v>

139
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:45.704
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm,</v>

140
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Clinton,</v>

141
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:49.640
<v Speaker 3>despite all my reservations about her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

142
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.490
<v Speaker 3>and when I got on my own facebook page,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you have to assume is filtered by</v>

143
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 3>the people who are following me on</v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook and,</v>

144
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.530
<v Speaker 3>and already liked me in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like a thousand comments of pure</v>

145
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:04.101
<v Speaker 3>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

146
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:05.660
<v Speaker 3>no one loves hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one,</v>

147
00:07:05.661 --> 00:07:06.291
<v Speaker 3>no one said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

148
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:08.680
<v Speaker 3>thank God someone's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's smart is for Hillary.</v>

149
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.360
<v Speaker 3>It was all just Bernie people and trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>people flaming me for,</v>

150
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.370
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>

151
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.560
<v Speaker 3>the most tepid possible endorsement of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton.</v>

152
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 3>All I said was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

153
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:21.830
<v Speaker 3>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

154
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Clinton is a liar and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's an opportunist and she's,</v>

155
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

156
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.630
<v Speaker 3>I completely get your reservations about</v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

157
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.120
<v Speaker 3>but at least she's grown up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

158
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 3>And</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's going to be the candidate.</v>

159
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:37.760
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to be sanders facilities</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the moment.</v>

160
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Now is the moment to put your political</v>
<v Speaker 3>idealism behind you if you're a sanders</v>

161
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:45.470
<v Speaker 3>person and recognize that there is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>vast difference between Clinton and</v>

162
00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:47.060
<v Speaker 3>trump and no itch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

163
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 3>she's not going to change the system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's also not going to run</v>

164
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 3>civilization off a cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

165
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget how I said it on facebook,</v>

166
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:56.030
<v Speaker 3>but it was just the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>

167
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.490
<v Speaker 3>it really was a lesser of two evils</v>
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>

168
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 3>And it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

169
00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing to see how energized and</v>

170
00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 3>passionate people are in defensive trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sanders.</v>

171
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.130
<v Speaker 3>And there's almost none of that for</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton.</v>

172
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.810
<v Speaker 3>It's like people are just sheepishly</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that they do just divulging that</v>

173
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:16.510
<v Speaker 3>they will vote for Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

174
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 3>but they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they may be somewhere that I haven't</v>

175
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:21.090
<v Speaker 3>noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone loves,</v>

176
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.730
<v Speaker 3>absolutely loves Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just,</v>

177
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:24.890
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She does not have her defenders the way</v>

178
00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 3>these guys do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the man enough to vote for</v>

179
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:28.780
<v Speaker 3>her campaign?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

180
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.130
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's with like hipster dudes with</v>

181
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.560
<v Speaker 3>tattoos and beards that are going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>vote for Hillary.</v>

182
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope it's fake because it's so</v>

183
00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:38.360
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope it's not real.</v>

184
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.630
<v Speaker 3>Is it fake?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>

185
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.960
<v Speaker 3>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so good though,</v>

186
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.290
<v Speaker 3>because it's not that fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty good.</v>

187
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.120
<v Speaker 3>Like you could almost see.</v>

188
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.910
<v Speaker 3>So wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

189
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 3>this is not bad for</v>

190
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.521
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

191
00:08:56.521 --> 00:08:57.480
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

192
00:08:57.481 --> 00:08:57.931
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

193
00:08:57.931 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just funny that someone would make a</v>

194
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 1>joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political ad that you have to be man</v>

195
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:08.460
<v Speaker 1>enough to vote for Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's guys out there that would</v>

196
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:10.020
<v Speaker 1>buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>

197
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it.</v>

198
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a scary time because it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem like anybody that you would want to</v>

199
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 1>be president wants to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're left with,</v>

200
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.460
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you pick?</v>

201
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like as if we're going to play the</v>
<v Speaker 1>super bowl with three of the shittiest</v>

202
00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:29.880
<v Speaker 1>teams we could find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to go get some drunk</v>

203
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:33.330
<v Speaker 1>high school kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get some inmates with club feet.</v>

204
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:36.060
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to throw whoever we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have the worst game ever.</v>

205
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>And this was what this game is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good game.</v>

206
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.580
<v Speaker 1>This is not a game where you've got like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a John F Kennedy versus a Lyndon Johnson</v>

207
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:48.870
<v Speaker 1>or it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like like powerful characters.</v>

208
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.050
<v Speaker 1>It's trump I guess is a really powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

209
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:55.770
<v Speaker 1>but in more ways like a showman</v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

210
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.130
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

211
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.760
<v Speaker 1>he's putting on a great show and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to win probably because he's</v>

212
00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 1>putting on such a great show and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a great show.</v>

213
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.440
<v Speaker 1>But I do</v>

214
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:11.560
<v Speaker 3>think I'm now have among the people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>think something new,</v>

215
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.230
<v Speaker 3>we're witnessing witnessing something</v>
<v Speaker 3>new with trump.</v>

216
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.320
<v Speaker 3>It's not just the same old thing where</v>
<v Speaker 3>the process is so onerous that it's</v>

217
00:10:21.701 --> 00:10:26.701
<v Speaker 3>selecting for the kind of narcissist or</v>
<v Speaker 3>thick skin person who is willing to</v>

218
00:10:28.001 --> 00:10:29.890
<v Speaker 3>submit to the process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there are many,</v>

219
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.990
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the good people just aren't</v>

220
00:10:31.991 --> 00:10:33.640
<v Speaker 3>going to put up with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

221
00:10:33.641 --> 00:10:34.900
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's that too.</v>

222
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.210
<v Speaker 3>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

223
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.800
<v Speaker 3>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

224
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.280
<v Speaker 3>it's a moment among</v>
<v Speaker 3>the electorate where it's like,</v>

225
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.920
<v Speaker 3>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an antistatic.</v>

226
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.060
<v Speaker 3>There's an ant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's enough of an antiestablishment</v>

227
00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.180
<v Speaker 3>mood and vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now is it happening with,</v>

228
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.380
<v Speaker 3>with sanders to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

229
00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:01.110
<v Speaker 3>where people just want to jam a stick in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wheel of the system just to see what</v>

230
00:11:01.901 --> 00:11:02.860
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

231
00:11:02.861 --> 00:11:06.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the main gripe against Hillary</v>

232
00:11:06.311 --> 00:11:08.860
<v Speaker 3>really is that she is politics as usual.</v>

233
00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.760
<v Speaker 3>She's not going to change the system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

234
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.290
<v Speaker 3>People want to change the system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not really thinking about</v>

235
00:11:14.291 --> 00:11:16.900
<v Speaker 3>the implications of radically changing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the system.</v>

236
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.450
<v Speaker 3>And in the case of trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

237
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:26.350
<v Speaker 3>I may hear or someone who is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was advertising his lack of</v>

238
00:11:26.351 --> 00:11:29.830
<v Speaker 3>qualifications for the office in every</v>
<v Speaker 3>way that he can,</v>

239
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.380
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

240
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.590
<v Speaker 3>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no,</v>

241
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even,</v>

242
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:40.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even bothered by his racism or</v>
<v Speaker 3>his misogyny or his demagoguery or is</v>

243
00:11:40.541 --> 00:11:41.021
<v Speaker 3>bully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

244
00:11:41.021 --> 00:11:45.520
<v Speaker 3>all of that I'm willing to guess is an</v>
<v Speaker 3>act right.</v>

245
00:11:45.521 --> 00:11:48.190
<v Speaker 3>That he's decided that that's somehow</v>
<v Speaker 3>pandering his base.</v>

246
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.620
<v Speaker 3>And he's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in truth,</v>

247
00:11:50.621 --> 00:11:52.270
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't have a racist bone in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

248
00:11:52.271 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 3>Say I'm willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to believe that I'm out.</v>

249
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why I would think that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>plausible,</v>

250
00:11:57.581 --> 00:11:58.500
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

251
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

252
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a hunch that he's far more</v>

253
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.660
<v Speaker 3>liberal than he seems and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>pandering.</v>

254
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.170
<v Speaker 3>But the thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

255
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:14.340
<v Speaker 3>can't be true is there's no way he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually brilliant and well informed</v>

256
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.570
<v Speaker 3>about all the issues and saying the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things he's saying.</v>

257
00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:24.571
<v Speaker 3>He's not pretending to be as uninformed</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as incoherent and as irresponsible</v>

258
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.200
<v Speaker 3>as he's seeming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

259
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.520
<v Speaker 3>because you wouldn't withhold</v>
<v Speaker 3>information that will make you a better</v>

260
00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:31.151
<v Speaker 3>leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

261
00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:31.661
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

262
00:12:31.661 --> 00:12:32.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just,</v>

263
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.450
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just the vacuum busyness of his</v>

264
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:35.590
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's,</v>

265
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.660
<v Speaker 3>he'll say that he'll say the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>three times in a row and it was</v>

266
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.520
<v Speaker 3>meaningless the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

267
00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:44.320
<v Speaker 3>He'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be amazing.</v>

268
00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:45.940
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very amazing.</v>

269
00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:47.350
<v Speaker 3>Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be so amazing.</v>

270
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.420
<v Speaker 3>And he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does this with everything.</v>

271
00:12:49.421 --> 00:12:53.800
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the transcripts of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>speeches and the fact that he can't,</v>

272
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:59.790
<v Speaker 3>he has never so far as I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has never once strung together a</v>

273
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:06.451
<v Speaker 3>string of sentences that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>even interesting.</v>

274
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.653
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he'd be like,</v>

275
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.740
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's never.</v>

276
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.790
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's never a moment where I read or I</v>

277
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:13.624
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

278
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:18.130
<v Speaker 3>this guy is smarter and better informed</v>
<v Speaker 3>than I realized that that moment never</v>

279
00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 3>comes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or I keep expecting to see that happen.</v>

280
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a little bit like my head is</v>

281
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.240
<v Speaker 3>this image of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine you have an urn right way and</v>

282
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.790
<v Speaker 3>you just keep pulling things out of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all you pull out of it as junk,</v>

283
00:13:30.791 --> 00:13:33.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You pull chicken bones and broken</v>

284
00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:36.940
<v Speaker 3>marbles and gum and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

285
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.920
<v Speaker 3>it's still possible that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you root around in that earned</v>

286
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.700
<v Speaker 3>long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to find the hope diamond.</v>

287
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:45.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in each round that you pull something</v>

288
00:13:45.611 --> 00:13:49.000
<v Speaker 3>out that really has no logical</v>
<v Speaker 3>implication for the next thing you might</v>

289
00:13:49.001 --> 00:13:52.270
<v Speaker 3>pull out of a the earn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But mines aren't like that when I see</v>

290
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:56.590
<v Speaker 3>what this guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does not say anything that a well</v>

291
00:13:56.591 --> 00:13:58.960
<v Speaker 3>informed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent person would say.</v>

292
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.270
<v Speaker 3>And it's just an ideas are connected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

293
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:03.190
<v Speaker 3>So you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

294
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.160
<v Speaker 3>you can't fake this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

295
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:11.050
<v Speaker 3>you can't fake being this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this uninformed and you can't fake being</v>

296
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.530
<v Speaker 3>really well informed and he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

297
00:14:13.531 --> 00:14:16.320
<v Speaker 3>we just look at one policy that he wants</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

298
00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.410
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>

299
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:18.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

300
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 3>the rounding up of illegal aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right around 11 million illegal aliens.</v>

301
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.460
<v Speaker 3>Now this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this gets stated as,</v>

302
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:25.900
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to round them up and send</v>

303
00:14:25.901 --> 00:14:27.710
<v Speaker 3>them back to Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

304
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.590
<v Speaker 3>and what worries me is no one seems to</v>
<v Speaker 3>care about that.</v>

305
00:14:32.591 --> 00:14:35.050
<v Speaker 3>If you just look at the implications of</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this,</v>

306
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:40.700
<v Speaker 3>it has this one policy claim alone is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>impractical and unethical.</v>

307
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:45.280
<v Speaker 3>It's just what are we talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>here?</v>

308
00:14:45.281 --> 00:14:47.460
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about like your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your gardener,</v>

309
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.970
<v Speaker 3>your housekeeper or the person that</v>
<v Speaker 3>works at the carwash,</v>

310
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 3>the person who picks the that you buy in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the market is going to get a knock on</v>

311
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:59.531
<v Speaker 3>the door in the middle of the night by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Gestapo and get sent back to.</v>

312
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.340
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority of these people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

313
00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.970
<v Speaker 3>are law abiding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are just working at jobs that</v>

314
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:10.570
<v Speaker 3>Americans by and large don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And many of them have kids who were</v>

315
00:15:11.101 --> 00:15:12.170
<v Speaker 3>American citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

316
00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:15.350
<v Speaker 3>And somebody to say someone's got kids</v>
<v Speaker 3>under the age of 10 who are American</v>

317
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 3>citizens and what you're going to send</v>
<v Speaker 3>that person back to Mexico and you're</v>

318
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:21.770
<v Speaker 3>going to do this by the hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands and millions.</v>

319
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:27.310
<v Speaker 3>It's just that one point alone held in</v>
<v Speaker 3>isolation from all of the other things.</v>

320
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:31.400
<v Speaker 3>He said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The crazy things like climate change is</v>

321
00:15:31.401 --> 00:15:35.300
<v Speaker 3>a hoax concocted by the Chinese to</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroy our manufacturing base.</v>

322
00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:36.500
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

323
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.140
<v Speaker 3>the fact that he likes Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

324
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.210
<v Speaker 3>everything else he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>write this one policy,</v>

325
00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:44.960
<v Speaker 3>claim alone should be enough to</v>
<v Speaker 3>disqualify a person's candidacy.</v>

326
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:48.020
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy with the moment you look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at it,</v>

327
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.990
<v Speaker 3>and yet no one seems to care.</v>

328
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.010
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is just,</v>

329
00:15:52.011 --> 00:15:55.520
<v Speaker 3>it's just more energizing to the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who already like him.</v>

330
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 3>I know that he said that he wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>build a wall,</v>

331
00:15:58.011 --> 00:16:01.670
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know that he wanted to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>rid of the illegal aliens,</v>

332
00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:04.820
<v Speaker 3>round them up and around them up and do</v>
<v Speaker 3>one with them,</v>

333
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.390
<v Speaker 3>send them back to their country is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

334
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.670
<v Speaker 3>That's such a crazy idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's so brutal.</v>

335
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.170
<v Speaker 3>The idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

336
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.230
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a sub human thing.</v>

337
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.660
<v Speaker 3>The only reason why people would come to</v>
<v Speaker 3>America as because they felt they felt</v>

338
00:16:17.661 --> 00:16:20.240
<v Speaker 3>like it would make their life better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people take a big risk.</v>

339
00:16:20.241 --> 00:16:23.090
<v Speaker 3>It's not an easy way to do it if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor,</v>

340
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.630
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any qualifications for</v>
<v Speaker 3>any unusual job.</v>

341
00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to get across to Mexico,</v>

342
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.640
<v Speaker 3>but everybody who does it does it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they want to improve their life,</v>

343
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the idea that one group of people</v>

344
00:16:33.921 --> 00:16:36.560
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be able to do it in one group</v>
<v Speaker 3>should just because they were born in</v>

345
00:16:36.561 --> 00:16:41.561
<v Speaker 3>the right side of some strange line that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is only a couple hundred years old.</v>

346
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.050
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

347
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:42.800
<v Speaker 3>but I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

348
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.430
<v Speaker 3>I'll go further in meeting him in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>middle,</v>

349
00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.220
<v Speaker 3>whereas I think we should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>defend our borders,</v>

350
00:16:49.221 --> 00:16:50.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it is,</v>

351
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a good argument for having</v>
<v Speaker 3>a porous border that we can't figure out</v>

352
00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:58.010
<v Speaker 3>how to defend and we don't know who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming into the country.</v>

353
00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:58.461
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

354
00:16:58.461 --> 00:17:02.960
<v Speaker 3>so I think building the wall is almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly a stupid idea among his many</v>

355
00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:06.980
<v Speaker 3>stupid ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it would be great to know</v>

356
00:17:06.981 --> 00:17:11.510
<v Speaker 3>who's coming in the country and have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a purely legal process by which that</v>

357
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.290
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

358
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.300
<v Speaker 3>ultimately that's got to be the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

359
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:19.310
<v Speaker 3>And we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in perfectly doing that.</v>

360
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:22.550
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't have an argument for open</v>

361
00:17:22.551 --> 00:17:25.220
<v Speaker 3>borders or porous borders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the question is,</v>

362
00:17:25.221 --> 00:17:30.221
<v Speaker 3>what do you do with 11 or 12 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are already here doing jobs</v>

363
00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:32.990
<v Speaker 3>we want them to do that help our</v>
<v Speaker 3>society,</v>

364
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the vast majority of them are law</v>

365
00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:39.380
<v Speaker 3>abiding people who as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or just trying to have better lives,</v>

366
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that you're going to break up</v>

367
00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:46.040
<v Speaker 3>families and send people back by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions and the idea that you're going</v>

368
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 3>to devote your law enforcement resources</v>
<v Speaker 3>to doing this when you have real</v>

369
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.910
<v Speaker 3>terrorism and real crime to s to deal</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

370
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.580
<v Speaker 3>It's just pure insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

371
00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:57.483
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

372
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:03.170
<v Speaker 3>and also totally unethical and yet he</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't get any points docked for this</v>

373
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.361
<v Speaker 3>aspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

374
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:08.370
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the things around which</v>

375
00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:12.360
<v Speaker 3>people are rallying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the climate change thing is also</v>

376
00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:13.590
<v Speaker 3>insane and dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

377
00:18:13.591 --> 00:18:15.450
<v Speaker 3>he was a birther,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

378
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

379
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.080
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the original birthers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was saying that Obama's birth</v>

380
00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:22.440
<v Speaker 3>certificate was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was born in Kenya,</v>

381
00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:23.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't he one of those guys?</v>

382
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

383
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.940
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

384
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.300
<v Speaker 3>I would love it if funding that for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>

385
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.450
<v Speaker 3>I would love to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he got into office and just said,</v>

386
00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:33.570
<v Speaker 3>listen folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am nothing like this person.</v>

387
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:37.620
<v Speaker 3>I pretended to be to win the presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to show you that you can</v>

388
00:18:37.621 --> 00:18:42.420
<v Speaker 3>be manipulated and get it together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then at peaches punk to all.</v>

389
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.470
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to hire some people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually know how to run things and</v>

390
00:18:46.471 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 3>we'll say that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

391
00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.240
<v Speaker 3>the smart people who are voting for him</v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

392
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.230
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think an actual,</v>

393
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.960
<v Speaker 3>a crazy position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they,</v>

394
00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:00.040
<v Speaker 3>they think that he is just pandering to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idiots who he needs to pander to,</v>

395
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.110
<v Speaker 3>to get into office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's,</v>

396
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:08.430
<v Speaker 3>he's not disavowing the white</v>
<v Speaker 3>supremacists votes,</v>

397
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:09.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

398
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.810
<v Speaker 3>the Alacrity that you would if you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>a decent human being and you found out</v>

399
00:19:12.811 --> 00:19:15.200
<v Speaker 3>that David Duke supported you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

400
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he needs to.</v>

401
00:19:17.071 --> 00:19:19.780
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he needs those votes and he knows that,</v>

402
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.640
<v Speaker 3>that most of the people in his base</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't going to care and he can just</v>

403
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.600
<v Speaker 3>kind of move on in the news cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

404
00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:31.730
<v Speaker 3>and he's doing this on all these issues</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he looked where smart people see</v>

405
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:35.430
<v Speaker 3>that he looks like a buffoon and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

406
00:19:35.431 --> 00:19:39.210
<v Speaker 3>and they are treating him as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who don't like him or</v>

407
00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:43.260
<v Speaker 3>treating him as a comic figure who he</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't really believe that stuff.</v>

408
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.570
<v Speaker 3>He's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's too sophisticated to really believe</v>

409
00:19:45.571 --> 00:19:46.920
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's just pandering.</v>

410
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

411
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:52.530
<v Speaker 3>one is people aren't seeing if that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>true,</v>

412
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.050
<v Speaker 3>just how unethical and weird that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>right here.</v>

413
00:19:55.051 --> 00:19:58.560
<v Speaker 3>The guy has no compunction about lying</v>
<v Speaker 3>and demonizing people.</v>

414
00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:02.640
<v Speaker 3>Like let's say he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say he thinks that that Clinton</v>

415
00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:05.760
<v Speaker 3>really isn't guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Bill Clinton isn't really guilty of,</v>

416
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:07.200
<v Speaker 3>of a rape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

417
00:20:07.201 --> 00:20:08.730
<v Speaker 3>And now he's calling him a rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now.</v>

418
00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:12.690
<v Speaker 3>At the time he was saying he wasn't a</v>
<v Speaker 3>rapist and he's just being defamed.</v>

419
00:20:12.691 --> 00:20:13.980
<v Speaker 3>And this is outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was taking,</v>

420
00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:15.680
<v Speaker 3>he was taking the side of a friend who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

421
00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:19.230
<v Speaker 3>he invited to his wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now he's,</v>

422
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.950
<v Speaker 3>he's calling him a rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

423
00:20:20.951 --> 00:20:23.790
<v Speaker 3>In a sexual Predator who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who've harmed women's rights more than</v>

424
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:26.040
<v Speaker 3>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so,</v>

425
00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:26.910
<v Speaker 3>which is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

426
00:20:26.911 --> 00:20:27.780
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's,</v>

427
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:32.810
<v Speaker 3>there's no version of the truth here</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes trump look at all acceptable</v>

428
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:34.020
<v Speaker 3>as a person.</v>

429
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:39.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like either he knew he was a rapist</v>
<v Speaker 3>and was defending him because he was</v>

430
00:20:39.421 --> 00:20:41.700
<v Speaker 3>just cozying up to power at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

431
00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.380
<v Speaker 3>Didn't care that he's a rapist or now</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

432
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.730
<v Speaker 3>he knows he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's still the guy who thinks he wasn't</v>

433
00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:49.720
<v Speaker 3>a rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now he just,</v>

434
00:20:49.721 --> 00:20:52.630
<v Speaker 3>for purely opportunistic reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

435
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's willing to call a guy a rapist who</v>

436
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:56.670
<v Speaker 3>he knows isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

437
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.180
<v Speaker 3>they're both horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

438
00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.110
<v Speaker 3>And it's not like there's new evidence</v>
<v Speaker 3>has come forward in the intervening</v>

439
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.280
<v Speaker 3>years that would have changed his mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>about what happened in,</v>

440
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.380
<v Speaker 3>in Clinton's presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's,</v>

441
00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:10.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

442
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:15.180
<v Speaker 3>but I think people think that he's got</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be much more sophisticated than he</v>

443
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:18.730
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that if he got into office,</v>

444
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.750
<v Speaker 3>he would just be a totally sober and</v>
<v Speaker 3>presidential person.</v>

445
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.340
<v Speaker 3>There's just no reason to believe that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

446
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:29.860
<v Speaker 3>if he thinks climate change is a hoax</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that we should pull out of the Paris</v>

447
00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 3>accord,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then what your ramp up coal production</v>

448
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.180
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to bring back the coal</v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs.</v>

449
00:21:34.181 --> 00:21:35.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what he's saying,</v>

450
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:37.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason to think he doesn't</v>

451
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.110
<v Speaker 3>believe this at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

452
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.350
<v Speaker 3>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

453
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.850
<v Speaker 3>it is a disastrous thing for a president</v>
<v Speaker 3>to think.</v>

454
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.410
<v Speaker 3>The only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

455
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:53.020
<v Speaker 1>fascinating versions of this that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been hearing from people that I respect</v>

456
00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.720
<v Speaker 1>are that the idea that he is like,</v>

457
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:57.463
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

458
00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.580
<v Speaker 1>the political version of the asteroid</v>
<v Speaker 1>that killed the dinosaurs.</v>

459
00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Like he's going to come down and smash</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and it's going to be so chaotic that</v>

460
00:22:04.601 --> 00:22:06.700
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be forced to reform the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

461
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.210
<v Speaker 1>And people are gonna respond in turn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way people are responding</v>

462
00:22:10.211 --> 00:22:12.310
<v Speaker 1>against factory farming and more people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going Vegan,</v>

463
00:22:12.311 --> 00:22:14.050
<v Speaker 1>like that kind of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to see it and they gonna</v>

464
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:17.110
<v Speaker 1>respond in turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is such a.</v>

465
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:20.380
<v Speaker 1>So it's like he's going to toss the</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple cart up in the air,</v>

466
00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:23.590
<v Speaker 1>he's just going to fuck this whole goofy</v>
<v Speaker 1>system up and then we'll be able to</v>

467
00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:26.140
<v Speaker 1>rebuild after trump has dismantled all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

468
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.290
<v Speaker 1>all the different special interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups and lobbyists and all the people</v>

469
00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:31.600
<v Speaker 1>that we really would like to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system.</v>

470
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.480
<v Speaker 1>We really don't like the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that they're such insane</v>

471
00:22:34.481 --> 00:22:39.430
<v Speaker 1>amounts of influence that big</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations and lobbyists have had on</v>

472
00:22:39.431 --> 00:22:39.670
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

473
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Laws get passed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This might be the way to do it.</v>

474
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.160
<v Speaker 1>You have some wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's fired.</v>

475
00:22:45.161 --> 00:22:47.410
<v Speaker 1>You have fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have fire Jetson.</v>

476
00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like a character like he's coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

477
00:22:49.691 --> 00:22:53.200
<v Speaker 1>His hair's plastic is all fired up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a billionaire.</v>

478
00:22:53.201 --> 00:22:55.690
<v Speaker 1>He made all his own money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of dad gave him some money,</v>

479
00:22:55.691 --> 00:22:58.690
<v Speaker 1>but you turned it into a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Point being he doesn't need anybody's</v>

480
00:22:58.691 --> 00:23:00.070
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is probably lying about the</v>

481
00:23:00.071 --> 00:23:04.240
<v Speaker 1>amount of money has he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a baller for sure though,</v>

482
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the very least,</v>

483
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.290
<v Speaker 1>he's got to be worth some cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

484
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:09.790
<v Speaker 1>I made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be a big difference between</v>

485
00:23:09.791 --> 00:23:11.620
<v Speaker 1>what he's claiming and what is in fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

486
00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:14.590
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a many</v>

487
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.040
<v Speaker 3>pieces here when people assume that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's a successful businessman,</v>

488
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.290
<v Speaker 3>he must understand the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

489
00:23:20.291 --> 00:23:22.630
<v Speaker 3>Which is no necessary connection there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

490
00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:28.770
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of rich people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally confused about economics and</v>

491
00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.760
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most economists don't have a lot of</v>

492
00:23:30.761 --> 00:23:32.920
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's no real connection there.</v>

493
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.270
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

494
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:36.483
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

495
00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what you're describing is</v>

496
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.240
<v Speaker 1>I kind of just random like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're just,</v>

497
00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.950
<v Speaker 1>let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just smash the window and then see</v>

498
00:23:45.951 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 1>what</v>

499
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.910
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

500
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.880
<v Speaker 3>What I'm going to light a fire to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this place and,</v>

501
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:52.480
<v Speaker 3>and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's um,</v>

502
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.270
<v Speaker 3>it almost any process by which you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>change the system is more intelligent</v>

503
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.270
<v Speaker 3>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

504
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.200
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's also not value in how much harm</v>

505
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.990
<v Speaker 3>one bad president could do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

506
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think even,</v>

507
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.410
<v Speaker 3>I haven't tested this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm imagining that even trump</v>

508
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:15.770
<v Speaker 3>supporters would answer this question</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I would hope,</v>

509
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.880
<v Speaker 3>which is like if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had a crystal ball that could tell</v>

510
00:24:19.881 --> 00:24:21.220
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't tell you who's going to be</v>

511
00:24:21.221 --> 00:24:24.560
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it tells you how it works out for</v>

512
00:24:24.561 --> 00:24:26.210
<v Speaker 3>the next president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if I,</v>

513
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.300
<v Speaker 3>if I look in the crystal ball and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>says the next president of United States</v>

514
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.440
<v Speaker 3>is a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

515
00:24:31.441 --> 00:24:33.230
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the worst president we've ever</v>

516
00:24:33.231 --> 00:24:35.150
<v Speaker 3>had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just think of,</v>

517
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:39.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just just failures of governance and,</v>

518
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:45.130
<v Speaker 3>and the toxic influence of narcissism</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Hubris that comes along just like</v>

519
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:46.880
<v Speaker 3>once every thousand years.</v>

520
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

521
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:50.570
<v Speaker 3>just disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

522
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:52.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you're a trump supporter,</v>

523
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.050
<v Speaker 3>which candidate that was like only trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

524
00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:00.700
<v Speaker 3>is likely to screw things up that badly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

525
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.130
<v Speaker 3>Clinton is going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to be almost perfectly</v>

526
00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:06.440
<v Speaker 3>predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's going to be a politician,</v>

527
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.590
<v Speaker 3>she's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's going to be basically centrist on</v>

528
00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:12.560
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on foreign policy and domestic policy.</v>

529
00:25:12.561 --> 00:25:14.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's going to be liberal on social</v>

530
00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:16.220
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

531
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:21.720
<v Speaker 3>she is not going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to dismantle NATO and to get into a</v>

532
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:29.080
<v Speaker 3>war with North Korea or get into an</v>
<v Speaker 3>alliance with Putin or image.</v>

533
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.520
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's not going to do something insane.</v>

534
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so alliance with Putin.</v>

535
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said basically only favorable things</v>

536
00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:39.650
<v Speaker 3>about Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're homeless.</v>

537
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.030
<v Speaker 3>They're tight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she get get.</v>

538
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:43.941
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully we'll,</v>

539
00:25:43.941 --> 00:25:48.850
<v Speaker 3>we'll see pictures with both of them on</v>
<v Speaker 3>horseback shirtless and out of the red</v>

540
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.680
<v Speaker 3>shirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll probably keep your shirt on.</v>

541
00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't see them as being the shirtless</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

542
00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

543
00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.730
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you just look at the landscape</v>

544
00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:06.200
<v Speaker 3>between Bernie and Hillary in him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

545
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:09.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it looks like the last gasps of a</v>

546
00:26:09.561 --> 00:26:11.120
<v Speaker 3>dying system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

547
00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.750
<v Speaker 3>But that's representative government</v>
<v Speaker 3>system for that is a lot of people are</v>

548
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:20.770
<v Speaker 3>saying that things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not hearing just how</v>

549
00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:25.940
<v Speaker 3>nihilistic that is if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

550
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.670
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's so much stuff we have</v>

551
00:26:28.671 --> 00:26:33.460
<v Speaker 3>to get right and there's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only tool to get it right is,</v>

552
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:38.420
<v Speaker 3>is having your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind actually understand what's</v>

553
00:26:38.421 --> 00:26:42.200
<v Speaker 3>going on in the world and how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulate the world in the direction</v>

554
00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:46.350
<v Speaker 3>you want it to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to understand like what,</v>

555
00:26:46.351 --> 00:26:50.850
<v Speaker 3>whether or not climate change is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your beliefs about it have to be</v>

556
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.250
<v Speaker 3>representative of that truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

557
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.850
<v Speaker 3>So like let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

558
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.570
<v Speaker 3>let's say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say I'm mistaken and there's,</v>

559
00:26:57.571 --> 00:26:59.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no human caused climate change</v>

560
00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:00.810
<v Speaker 3>is not a problem.</v>

561
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.350
<v Speaker 3>And every moment spent thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

562
00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:08.340
<v Speaker 3>worrying about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correcting for it is just a waste of</v>

563
00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:11.100
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just throwing out the wealth of</v>

564
00:27:11.101 --> 00:27:11.934
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

565
00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a terrible thing,</v>

566
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it really matters who's right about</v>

567
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:21.120
<v Speaker 3>that and the fact that we have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>president or a candidate who is coming</v>

568
00:27:21.121 --> 00:27:24.480
<v Speaker 3>in saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all bullshit,</v>

569
00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:25.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

570
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:30.500
<v Speaker 3>in defiance of all of the science is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

571
00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.350
<v Speaker 3>and it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's on every other problem.</v>

572
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.310
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you he doesn't know the</v>

573
00:27:38.311 --> 00:27:42.900
<v Speaker 3>difference between Sunni and Shia Islam</v>
<v Speaker 3>or which countries are Sunni</v>

574
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:44.820
<v Speaker 3>predominantly in which are Shia</v>
<v Speaker 3>predominantly,</v>

575
00:27:44.821 --> 00:27:47.040
<v Speaker 3>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he's going to do.</v>

576
00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:48.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he's going to cram for</v>
<v Speaker 3>this final exam.</v>

577
00:27:48.901 --> 00:27:52.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure before one of those debates</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to get someone's gonna sit</v>

578
00:27:52.411 --> 00:27:55.650
<v Speaker 3>down with him and give him some bullet</v>
<v Speaker 3>points he's got to have in his head,</v>

579
00:27:55.651 --> 00:27:58.770
<v Speaker 3>but his head is just not in this game.</v>

580
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:02.700
<v Speaker 3>It's never been in this game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's obvious from everything he says and</v>

581
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.580
<v Speaker 3>that's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something you can't say about Clinton,</v>

582
00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For all of her flaws as a person,</v>

583
00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:09.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't care how much you hate her as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

584
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.050
<v Speaker 3>She understands what's going on in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world and that's.</v>

585
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:18.000
<v Speaker 3>That difference is so enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget about all the other character</v>

586
00:28:18.001 --> 00:28:21.420
<v Speaker 3>flaws of this guy who is just obviously</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to.</v>

587
00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:22.763
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

588
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:27.330
<v Speaker 3>but are we attached to much to this idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>of one person being the figurehead?</v>

589
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.900
<v Speaker 3>We figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone has to be the decider.</v>

590
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:34.130
<v Speaker 3>If we all woke up today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if everybody woke up and there was just</v>

591
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.450
<v Speaker 3>no government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was nothing more.</v>

592
00:28:36.451 --> 00:28:37.560
<v Speaker 3>I'll just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>

593
00:28:37.561 --> 00:28:39.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we've got to figure out how to run</v>

594
00:28:39.511 --> 00:28:40.261
<v Speaker 3>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

595
00:28:40.261 --> 00:28:42.360
<v Speaker 3>we had no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no previous understanding of government.</v>

596
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.420
<v Speaker 3>Would you think anybody would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need one dude to just run this whole</v>

597
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.970
<v Speaker 3>giant continent filled with 300 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

598
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.530
<v Speaker 3>Most likely if we woke up and we had</v>
<v Speaker 3>technology like we have today,</v>

599
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.800
<v Speaker 3>we have the ability to communicate like</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have today with social media and</v>

600
00:28:55.801 --> 00:28:58.670
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would probably say we need to like</v>

601
00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:01.470
<v Speaker 3>figure this out amongst each other and</v>
<v Speaker 3>find the people that have the most</v>

602
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.490
<v Speaker 3>qualified for each one of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>positions and start running our</v>

603
00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:08.070
<v Speaker 3>government that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that that's what we're attempting</v>

604
00:29:08.071 --> 00:29:09.480
<v Speaker 3>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just,</v>

605
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.670
<v Speaker 3>and I totally agree with you that it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>astonishing that out of a nation of 300</v>

606
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.280
<v Speaker 3>million people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are the choices you would think</v>

607
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.950
<v Speaker 3>you would think it'd be starting from</v>
<v Speaker 3>your basic,</v>

608
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your zero set point of just,</v>

609
00:29:21.721 --> 00:29:24.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we're going to reboot civilization.</v>

610
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would think that if you had this</v>

611
00:29:27.691 --> 00:29:32.610
<v Speaker 3>kind of process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each candidate would be more impressive</v>

612
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:33.350
<v Speaker 3>than the next.</v>

613
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.840
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

614
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.880
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe each,</v>

615
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.490
<v Speaker 3>each person who came to the podium like</v>
<v Speaker 3>James.</v>

616
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:40.620
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like,</v>

617
00:29:40.621 --> 00:29:42.600
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like the dunk contest for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>NBA.</v>

618
00:29:42.601 --> 00:29:43.720
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

619
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.070
<v Speaker 3>I could just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you thought you saw the best dunk</v>

620
00:29:47.071 --> 00:29:47.861
<v Speaker 3>in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

621
00:29:47.861 --> 00:29:50.950
<v Speaker 3>the next guy comes along and it would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

622
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.360
<v Speaker 3>It would be that on every topic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

623
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.920
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like you'd be talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>science of climate change.</v>

624
00:29:56.921 --> 00:30:00.730
<v Speaker 3>It'll be talking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual dynamics of the war on</v>

625
00:30:00.731 --> 00:30:03.050
<v Speaker 3>terror.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You to topics that,</v>

626
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.250
<v Speaker 3>that seem to have no relationship where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would have to be.</v>

627
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.310
<v Speaker 3>You'd be amazed that anyone could be an</v>
<v Speaker 3>expert in all of them.</v>

628
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:13.120
<v Speaker 3>You would find someone who is an expert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a functional expert in all of them.</v>

629
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.260
<v Speaker 3>Agility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>winter dude.</v>

630
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:14.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

631
00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:15.520
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

632
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.690
<v Speaker 3>but someone who is also ethically wise</v>
<v Speaker 3>who wasn't just wasn't obviously an</v>

633
00:30:19.691 --> 00:30:20.524
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>

634
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:25.490
<v Speaker 3>And who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

635
00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.680
<v Speaker 3>who had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mature relationship to changing his or</v>

636
00:30:32.261 --> 00:30:33.160
<v Speaker 3>her mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

637
00:30:33.161 --> 00:30:36.870
<v Speaker 3>So like the whole bit about flip</v>
<v Speaker 3>flopping and not,</v>

638
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being someone who could honestly</v>

639
00:30:40.871 --> 00:30:45.130
<v Speaker 3>represent changes of mind in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>across a political career.</v>

640
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.500
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is nowhere written.</v>

641
00:30:47.501 --> 00:30:51.430
<v Speaker 3>That is a good thing to believe today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you believe 20 years ago.</v>

642
00:30:51.431 --> 00:30:53.080
<v Speaker 3>In fact that they do that on every</v>
<v Speaker 3>topic.</v>

643
00:30:53.081 --> 00:30:55.600
<v Speaker 3>It means basically you haven't been in</v>
<v Speaker 3>dialogue with the world,</v>

644
00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.730
<v Speaker 3>but there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so taboo to change your mind that</v>

645
00:31:00.731 --> 00:31:03.610
<v Speaker 3>either you have to lie about it or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to pretend it was a,</v>

646
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:07.860
<v Speaker 3>it was always that way or it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

647
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm an assistant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet the system is,</v>

648
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.130
<v Speaker 3>is broken in that respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But given the choices,</v>

649
00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you have a choice between</v>

650
00:31:17.201 --> 00:31:22.201
<v Speaker 3>someone who is for all her flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>been in the game for long enough to be</v>

651
00:31:24.071 --> 00:31:28.420
<v Speaker 3>really well informed and capable of</v>
<v Speaker 3>compromise and capable of,</v>

652
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just just,</v>

653
00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.400
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking,</v>

654
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:37.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire machine.</v>

655
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have someone who's just,</v>

656
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:44.790
<v Speaker 3>he could just kind of stepped off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>set of his reality TV show and then lied</v>

657
00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:49.630
<v Speaker 3>about everything and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and elbowed his way onto your television</v>

658
00:31:49.631 --> 00:31:52.250
<v Speaker 3>set and never left because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

659
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:55.600
<v Speaker 3>CNN couldn't figure out how to give the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mic to someone else.</v>

660
00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

661
00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:59.050
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

662
00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a product of attention because they</v>

663
00:32:01.631 --> 00:32:04.320
<v Speaker 1>realize that there's the heated race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

664
00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:06.730
<v Speaker 1>The heated race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy was really famous and in a</v>

665
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:09.460
<v Speaker 1>heated race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy would say some crazy stuff and</v>

666
00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:11.980
<v Speaker 1>so they would tune into them so</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody had to do an intro.</v>

667
00:32:11.981 --> 00:32:13.780
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of him saying crazy stuff,</v>

668
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:16.210
<v Speaker 1>he accelerated the amount they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about them.</v>

669
00:32:16.211 --> 00:32:19.630
<v Speaker 1>So they're constantly talking about him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and barely talking about other people.</v>

670
00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.493
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

671
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.330
<v Speaker 3>But he's created a worm hole in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>political process now where there's</v>

672
00:32:24.331 --> 00:32:28.700
<v Speaker 3>nothing so crazy that could disqualify</v>
<v Speaker 3>him among the people who like him to.</v>

673
00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:33.730
<v Speaker 3>So he can just keep it just like nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 3>bombs of craziness that the press can't</v>

674
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.770
<v Speaker 3>ignore that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time they think,</v>

675
00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.000
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the crazy.</v>

676
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:41.180
<v Speaker 3>He said that's going to harm his</v>
<v Speaker 3>candidacy,</v>

677
00:32:41.181 --> 00:32:45.290
<v Speaker 3>so let's shine a light on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just helps him know he could just,</v>

678
00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:46.011
<v Speaker 3>he could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

679
00:32:46.011 --> 00:32:47.450
<v Speaker 3>he could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could get on twitter right now and</v>

680
00:32:47.451 --> 00:32:48.320
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know who I'd like to.</v>

681
00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:53.570
<v Speaker 1>I'd like Nicki Minaj and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would work for him.</v>

682
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:59.430
<v Speaker 1>It would work for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would use a tweet storm of a billion</v>

683
00:32:59.431 --> 00:33:02.210
<v Speaker 1>people who say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to fuck Nikki Minaj to go get</v>

684
00:33:02.211 --> 00:33:05.130
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's insanity.</v>

685
00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:09.300
<v Speaker 1>That's where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in a sense,</v>

686
00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:12.480
<v Speaker 1>if w w we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do admit that this is a fucked up</v>

687
00:33:12.481 --> 00:33:13.890
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not ideal.</v>

688
00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.590
<v Speaker 1>It should definitely be reworked and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to rework.</v>

689
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't the best way to rework it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A trump asteroid just slams right into</v>

690
00:33:21.151 --> 00:33:22.980
<v Speaker 1>the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

691
00:33:22.981 --> 00:33:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Blows the whole thing sky high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what terrible things have to</v>

692
00:33:27.811 --> 00:33:30.480
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that would be enough.</v>

693
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.800
<v Speaker 1>The thing is we have those,</v>

694
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:36.190
<v Speaker 3>those asteroids are coming anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you look at like nine slash 11</v>

695
00:33:36.191 --> 00:33:37.210
<v Speaker 3>was an asteroid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

696
00:33:37.211 --> 00:33:39.600
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a superbug that,</v>

697
00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:44.410
<v Speaker 3>that becomes a pandemic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these are things that are coming</v>

698
00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:49.930
<v Speaker 3>and we need people who are in touch</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

699
00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.540
<v Speaker 3>with reality to deal with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

700
00:33:52.541 --> 00:33:56.080
<v Speaker 3>So like the moment someone advertises</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

701
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:59.470
<v Speaker 3>not only their ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that they don't care that</v>

702
00:33:59.471 --> 00:34:02.200
<v Speaker 3>they're ignorant and they do this again</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

703
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:06.220
<v Speaker 3>they keep doubling down that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you put that person at the</v>

704
00:34:06.221 --> 00:34:10.180
<v Speaker 3>helm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you have done is basically put</v>

705
00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:11.900
<v Speaker 3>chaos at the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

706
00:34:11.901 --> 00:34:14.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person's going to believe whatever</v>

707
00:34:14.021 --> 00:34:17.770
<v Speaker 3>he believes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless of the information coming in</v>

708
00:34:17.771 --> 00:34:20.320
<v Speaker 3>and regardless of the consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just,</v>

709
00:34:20.321 --> 00:34:21.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

710
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:24.040
<v Speaker 3>it's worse than having no one in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

711
00:34:24.041 --> 00:34:24.874
<v Speaker 3>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>

712
00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:28.180
<v Speaker 3>you've put the power in this person's</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands,</v>

713
00:34:28.181 --> 00:34:28.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

714
00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:29.620
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person is,</v>

715
00:34:29.621 --> 00:34:34.621
<v Speaker 3>everything has to go through this node</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the network that is just like an</v>

716
00:34:34.781 --> 00:34:36.940
<v Speaker 3>information scrambling device,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

717
00:34:36.941 --> 00:34:37.721
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know how Matt,</v>

718
00:34:37.721 --> 00:34:39.580
<v Speaker 3>no matter how good the information is</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming in,</v>

719
00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:43.180
<v Speaker 3>you have everything that you've got a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bottleneck here which just screws up the</v>

720
00:34:43.181 --> 00:34:44.014
<v Speaker 3>signal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

721
00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're doing if you're,</v>

722
00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.810
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're hiring someone like this,</v>

723
00:34:49.811 --> 00:34:52.180
<v Speaker 3>who I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

724
00:34:52.181 --> 00:34:53.320
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the best case,</v>

725
00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:57.490
<v Speaker 3>you're what you stated earlier would in</v>
<v Speaker 3>fact be true,</v>

726
00:34:57.491 --> 00:34:57.730
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

727
00:34:57.730 --> 00:34:59.920
<v Speaker 3>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll get into the oval office and even</v>

728
00:34:59.921 --> 00:35:02.290
<v Speaker 3>he will be scared about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the prospect that he is now</v>

729
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:06.840
<v Speaker 1>running the better part of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization and he will hire the best</v>

730
00:35:06.841 --> 00:35:09.570
<v Speaker 1>people or some semblance of the</v>

731
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:14.690
<v Speaker 3>people he can get access to and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me how to not screw this up.</v>

732
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:17.930
<v Speaker 3>And that will be a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it'll,</v>

733
00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.910
<v Speaker 3>then it'll essentially be business as</v>
<v Speaker 3>usual,</v>

734
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:22.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In so far as you've hired,</v>

735
00:35:22.101 --> 00:35:26.030
<v Speaker 3>the best people will be people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who are are deeply in this game</v>

736
00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:26.864
<v Speaker 3>already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

737
00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:28.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll defer to the generals when it</v>

738
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.070
<v Speaker 1>comes time to make war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being real.</v>

739
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Really pragmatic about how they pick</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians and how they push certain</v>

740
00:35:35.661 --> 00:35:39.120
<v Speaker 1>people and decide not to push others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that something like trump</v>

741
00:35:39.121 --> 00:35:41.850
<v Speaker 1>completely changes how they move</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward?</v>

742
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Now they realize that this can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now that you see that people are so</v>

743
00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:49.860
<v Speaker 1>goofy were so wwe eat out that you can</v>

<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

745
00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:53.610
<v Speaker 1>this is where we're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a guys.</v>

746
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.430
<v Speaker 1>I told them the wall just got 10 foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher.</v>

747
00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets crazy.</v>

748
00:35:58.261 --> 00:36:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Like how could you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once they realize that that's possible.</v>

749
00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.550
<v Speaker 1>How long before you get like some</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational speaker type dudes?</v>

750
00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.810
<v Speaker 1>How long before they start jumping in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

751
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Tony Robbins says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we,</v>

752
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:10.510
<v Speaker 1>that's what we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

753
00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:11.830
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

754
00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:13.680
<v Speaker 1>this is way worse than Tony Robbins for</v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

755
00:36:13.681 --> 00:36:14.191
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way,</v>

756
00:36:14.191 --> 00:36:14.760
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

757
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Tony Robbins positive dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

758
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd vote for him.</v>

759
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony Robbins positive guy.</v>

760
00:36:19.381 --> 00:36:20.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what it means,</v>

761
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:26.090
<v Speaker 1>but that sort of ability to excite</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to get like one of those</v>

762
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.770
<v Speaker 1>motivational speaker dudes like those</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

763
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a lot of yoga pants and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>

764
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.160
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be the next president is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get us in shape</v>

765
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:38.280
<v Speaker 1>to be a reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>America is a reality show where there</v>

766
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:40.050
<v Speaker 1>were awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're the best.</v>

767
00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Did you see this press conference he</v>
<v Speaker 3>held?</v>

768
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:45.700
<v Speaker 3>I think it was yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

769
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.870
<v Speaker 3>I did not know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a very funny moment where the,</v>

770
00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:52.460
<v Speaker 3>there was one journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't recognize who it was,</v>

771
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.863
<v Speaker 3>who gets hooked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

772
00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.880
<v Speaker 3>so trump was being very combative with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the press pool and he was,</v>

773
00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:00.110
<v Speaker 3>he was basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

774
00:37:00.111 --> 00:37:02.510
<v Speaker 3>shouting them down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not answering any of the questions and</v>

775
00:37:02.511 --> 00:37:04.280
<v Speaker 3>one journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a gas said,</v>

776
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.800
<v Speaker 3>is this what is going to be like when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're president and is this,</v>

777
00:37:07.801 --> 00:37:11.120
<v Speaker 3>how is this going to be like to be in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the White House press corps and deal</v>

778
00:37:11.121 --> 00:37:13.130
<v Speaker 3>with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

779
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.133
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

780
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:17.900
<v Speaker 3>this is exactly what's gonna be like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

781
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:19.270
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could just see that like the</v>

782
00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.690
<v Speaker 3>journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they,</v>

783
00:37:20.691 --> 00:37:22.030
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they turn the camera on the room of</v>

784
00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:27.040
<v Speaker 3>journalists and they like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are astonished by what is happening</v>

785
00:37:28.851 --> 00:37:29.000
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

786
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.790
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't know they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>participating in this process and in</v>

787
00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:34.540
<v Speaker 3>some sense they've created this process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

788
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.863
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

789
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:38.263
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all of you.</v>

790
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:42.310
<v Speaker 3>Many of you are enough of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this what you do?</v>

791
00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:44.400
<v Speaker 3>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this what it's going to be covering</v>

792
00:37:44.401 --> 00:37:45.710
<v Speaker 3>you if your president?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

793
00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.490
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you to have this kind of</v>

794
00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:48.960
<v Speaker 3>take charge in the restroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

795
00:37:48.961 --> 00:37:50.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is gonna to be like this David.</v>

796
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:55.320
<v Speaker 3>If the press writes false stores like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did with this because you know,</v>

797
00:37:55.321 --> 00:37:57.900
<v Speaker 3>probably half of you are amazed that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>raised all this money.</v>

798
00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:03.270
<v Speaker 3>If the press writes fault like they did</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I wanted to keep a low profile.</v>

799
00:38:03.271 --> 00:38:05.610
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want the credit for raising all</v>
<v Speaker 3>this money for the vets.</v>

800
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.850
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't looking for the credit and by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way more money is coming in.</v>

801
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.110
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't looking for the credit but I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had no choice but to do this because the</v>

802
00:38:13.111 --> 00:38:15.240
<v Speaker 3>press was saying I didn't raise any</v>
<v Speaker 3>money for them.</v>

803
00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:19.200
<v Speaker 3>Not only that are raised it much of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was given a long time ago and there is a</v>

804
00:38:19.201 --> 00:38:21.210
<v Speaker 3>vetting process and I think you</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that,</v>

805
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:25.290
<v Speaker 3>but when I raised almost $6,000,000 and</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably in the end were raised more</v>

806
00:38:25.291 --> 00:38:28.110
<v Speaker 3>than six because more is going to come</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and is coming in.</v>

807
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.230
<v Speaker 3>But when I raised five point 6 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>as of today,</v>

808
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.350
<v Speaker 3>more is coming in and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

809
00:38:33.351 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 3>and this is going to phenomenal groups</v>
<v Speaker 3>and have many</v>

810
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:40.480
<v Speaker 1>of these people vetting the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are getting the money and work you play</v>

811
00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:41.920
<v Speaker 1>at the moment I was referring to</v>

812
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:49.400
<v Speaker 3>say here is a case where he's probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost certainly line about his history</v>

813
00:38:50.021 --> 00:38:54.310
<v Speaker 3>of giving to veterans affairs and says</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gave money very recently after people</v>

814
00:38:54.311 --> 00:38:57.910
<v Speaker 3>started fishing around to see if he</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually had given the money that he</v>

815
00:38:57.911 --> 00:38:59.590
<v Speaker 3>claimed were given to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to veterans.</v>

816
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:02.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

817
00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is.</v>

818
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:08.770
<v Speaker 3>What's difficult about this is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the PR,</v>

819
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.800
<v Speaker 3>yes there are the press is highly</v>
<v Speaker 3>imperfect and there and also partisan</v>

820
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:19.300
<v Speaker 3>and there are false stories and there</v>
<v Speaker 3>are exaggerations and they screw people</v>

821
00:39:19.301 --> 00:39:20.140
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

822
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:25.650
<v Speaker 3>And there are reasons to</v>
<v Speaker 3>not trust the press from time to time,</v>

823
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.790
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this case you have a,</v>

824
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:39.670
<v Speaker 3>someone who the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no amount of fact checking and</v>

825
00:39:39.671 --> 00:39:42.430
<v Speaker 3>discuss information of his statements</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

826
00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:47.000
<v Speaker 3>that forces him to ever acknowledge</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that he's done wrong and the,</v>

827
00:39:47.001 --> 00:39:49.240
<v Speaker 3>and the lack of acknowledgement to.</v>

828
00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:52.480
<v Speaker 3>He pays no price for it among,</v>
<v Speaker 3>among the people who like him.</v>

829
00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:56.590
<v Speaker 3>And so the press is powerless and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

830
00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.050
<v Speaker 3>but the net result of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a press conference like this,</v>

831
00:39:59.051 --> 00:40:04.051
<v Speaker 3>if you're a trump follower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he just showed how a biased and and</v>

832
00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.320
<v Speaker 3>petty the press pool is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

833
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:12.490
<v Speaker 3>and the press do need to just be beaten</v>
<v Speaker 3>up by a strong man who,</v>

834
00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.870
<v Speaker 3>who's not gonna stand for their</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

835
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:15.730
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>

836
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:17.070
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

837
00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:21.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unbecoming the very least,</v>

838
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.790
<v Speaker 3>that kind of communication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of unbecoming that person that</v>

839
00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:27.460
<v Speaker 3>we expect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's pretty mild compared to his,</v>

840
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his parody of the,</v>

841
00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.890
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

842
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:35.550
<v Speaker 3>the disabled reporter who he saw that</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit where he did like a,</v>

843
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.023
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

844
00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.690
<v Speaker 3>a cerebral palsy imitation at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at one of his speeches.</v>

845
00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:41.651
<v Speaker 3>He was the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

846
00:40:41.651 --> 00:40:42.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

847
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:44.440
<v Speaker 3>He was interviewed by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't happen to know who the.</v>

848
00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.520
<v Speaker 1>And it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roberto was.</v>

849
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.341
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was making.</v>

850
00:40:46.341 --> 00:40:48.680
<v Speaker 1>He was making fun of somebody with</v>
<v Speaker 1>cerebral palsy.</v>

851
00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done so many</v>

852
00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:54.790
<v Speaker 3>things that you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you would think would be</v>

853
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:58.720
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally canceling of a person's</v>
<v Speaker 3>political aspirations.</v>

854
00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:01.390
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't even cut Marco Rubio</v>

855
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.970
<v Speaker 3>pretending to be like a just</v>

856
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:08.050
<v Speaker 1>goofy on someone's cerebral palsy</v>
<v Speaker 1>added at one of his campaign events.</v>

857
00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

858
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:14.660
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that Ted Cruz was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>that video of him with his family.</v>

859
00:41:14.661 --> 00:41:17.510
<v Speaker 1>The outtakes where they read into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

860
00:41:17.511 --> 00:41:18.344
<v Speaker 1>you didn't see it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

861
00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.660
<v Speaker 1>it's a gem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's spectacular.</v>

862
00:41:20.661 --> 00:41:25.160
<v Speaker 1>It's him with his mom and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom prays for me often for hours</v>

863
00:41:25.161 --> 00:41:26.330
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was like,</v>

864
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:30.970
<v Speaker 1>she looks at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck for hours every day.</v>

865
00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:31.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

866
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 1>He can't even say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they have all these really</v>

867
00:41:34.221 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 1>awkward moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

868
00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.740
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go in for a hug.</v>

869
00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:37.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say I love you.</v>

870
00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:43.760
<v Speaker 1>It's all like weirdly mapped out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that got online and people were like,</v>

871
00:41:43.761 --> 00:41:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>

872
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.750
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See this is,</v>

873
00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.180
<v Speaker 1>this is a bad game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not even good at this game.</v>

874
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.040
<v Speaker 1>This is you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're terrible at this game.</v>

875
00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was objective really terrible.</v>

876
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.233
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his,</v>

877
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.980
<v Speaker 1>that's trumped competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

878
00:41:57.981 --> 00:42:00.230
<v Speaker 1>the thing that we'll think about cruise</v>
<v Speaker 1>that never even got out,</v>

879
00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.290
<v Speaker 1>which was the reason to be scared about</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Cruz presidency,</v>

880
00:42:03.291 --> 00:42:06.170
<v Speaker 1>was his level of religious craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

881
00:42:06.171 --> 00:42:09.860
<v Speaker 1>no one was even pushing on that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was just enough to push on before</v>

882
00:42:09.861 --> 00:42:12.470
<v Speaker 1>he even got to that door and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold onto those weapons.</v>

883
00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:13.813
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hadn't been.</v>

884
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Had crews been the nominee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been all about religion.</v>

885
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.680
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's odd is that that's not a handicap</v>

886
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:26.480
<v Speaker 1>in 2016 that you can have that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people consider it an asset.</v>

887
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that's</v>

888
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:32.890
<v Speaker 3>pricing and actually hopeful in trump's</v>
<v Speaker 3>candidacy is the fact that he has,</v>

889
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:39.580
<v Speaker 3>he has dissected out the religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social conservative component of,</v>

890
00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:43.640
<v Speaker 3>of the Republican Party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like evangelicals,</v>

891
00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:47.210
<v Speaker 3>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going for trump over crews when it</v>

892
00:42:47.211 --> 00:42:52.211
<v Speaker 3>was pretty clear to them that trump was</v>
<v Speaker 3>just pretending to be religious and</v>

893
00:42:52.401 --> 00:42:54.240
<v Speaker 3>Minnesota.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So trump gave one speech at,</v>

894
00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.530
<v Speaker 3>I think Liberty University where he</v>
<v Speaker 3>spoke.</v>

895
00:42:57.531 --> 00:42:59.930
<v Speaker 3>He said Corinthians two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

896
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:02.750
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the way any bible reader</v>

897
00:43:02.751 --> 00:43:05.810
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would speak about a second Corinthians.</v>

898
00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.790
<v Speaker 3>How would you say it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second Corinthians,</v>

899
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:09.140
<v Speaker 3>that's how you'd say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

900
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

901
00:43:10.011 --> 00:43:11.400
<v Speaker 3>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he said Corinthians two,</v>

902
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:15.290
<v Speaker 3>it's as though this is something he just</v>
<v Speaker 3>opened every,</v>

903
00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:20.440
<v Speaker 3>every night before you went to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it is clear that it was clear to</v>

904
00:43:21.201 --> 00:43:23.750
<v Speaker 3>them that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he is just,</v>

905
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:27.380
<v Speaker 3>just miming the language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

906
00:43:27.381 --> 00:43:31.520
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I'm impersonating a person of faith</v>

907
00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:36.580
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't care really as long as he</v>

908
00:43:36.741 --> 00:43:37.400
<v Speaker 3>does it.</v>

909
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.630
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

910
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:40.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're gonna look for a silver lining</v>

911
00:43:40.221 --> 00:43:41.390
<v Speaker 3>to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

912
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:46.870
<v Speaker 3>it shows that it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's they just want a space where their</v>

913
00:43:47.661 --> 00:43:52.661
<v Speaker 3>religious convictions are not under</v>
<v Speaker 3>attack and they don't really care that</v>

914
00:43:53.001 --> 00:43:57.290
<v Speaker 3>the person in charge share them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just if you pretend to share them,</v>

915
00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:59.210
<v Speaker 3>that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

916
00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:02.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's better than actually carrying</v>

917
00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.220
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This person really believe in the</v>

918
00:44:04.221 --> 00:44:07.850
<v Speaker 3>rapture or anything else that is quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously crazy.</v>

919
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:10.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

920
00:44:10.041 --> 00:44:10.581
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

921
00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:13.640
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think any Christian who</v>
<v Speaker 3>voting for trump thinks,</v>

922
00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:17.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean they'll say I'm not going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>judge another man's faith,</v>

923
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or I'm not.</v>

924
00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Who am I to say what's really in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>heart,</v>

925
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:20.781
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll say that,</v>

926
00:44:20.781 --> 00:44:23.770
<v Speaker 3>but he's just given.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

927
00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.980
<v Speaker 3>if you've been paying attention to who</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been and,</v>

928
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.970
<v Speaker 3>and if you just look at how he talks</v>
<v Speaker 3>about these things,</v>

929
00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any Christian that it.</v>

930
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:36.300
<v Speaker 3>So I think they're willing to vote for</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone for it now,</v>

931
00:44:36.301 --> 00:44:41.070
<v Speaker 3>for other reasons that are fairly</v>
<v Speaker 3>depressing in their own right.</v>

932
00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:43.870
<v Speaker 3>They're willing to vote for someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>

933
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:46.470
<v Speaker 3>who doesn't really play the game the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>

934
00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:54.060
<v Speaker 3>You have to believe in God to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>president in 2016.</v>

935
00:44:54.061 --> 00:44:54.601
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't you?</v>

936
00:44:54.601 --> 00:44:56.640
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That has to pretend to believe in God.</v>

937
00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:00.060
<v Speaker 3>But I think with trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it,</v>

938
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:05.090
<v Speaker 3>I think the pretense is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is obvious enough that I don't think</v>

939
00:45:05.221 --> 00:45:09.150
<v Speaker 3>he's fooling the better part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the people who were voting for him,</v>

940
00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:09.901
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who would,</v>

941
00:45:09.901 --> 00:45:13.680
<v Speaker 3>who would say they care about a person</v>
<v Speaker 3>of faith being in the White House.</v>

942
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.000
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if anything,</v>

943
00:45:15.001 --> 00:45:19.620
<v Speaker 3>he might be in one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might be breaking the barrier on</v>

944
00:45:19.621 --> 00:45:22.410
<v Speaker 3>having an atheist president because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think he,</v>

945
00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:28.080
<v Speaker 3>it's just nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody thinks he is a person of faith.</v>

946
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:31.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone really thinks that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's perfect.</v>

947
00:45:31.981 --> 00:45:33.600
<v Speaker 3>He's made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be our first atheist president</v>

948
00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.760
<v Speaker 3>who would help us in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that regard as well.</v>

949
00:45:35.761 --> 00:45:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Another trump media right into the White</v>
<v Speaker 3>House.</v>

950
00:45:37.861 --> 00:45:38.910
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm starting to sound like a trump</v>

951
00:45:38.911 --> 00:45:39.360
<v Speaker 3>supporter.</v>

952
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.310
<v Speaker 3>Occasionally an asteroid does something</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

953
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Who would be the ideal president?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like what,</v>

954
00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:45.780
<v Speaker 3>what kind of a person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

955
00:45:45.781 --> 00:45:48.060
<v Speaker 3>it would probably be a person who</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't seek attention.</v>

956
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.640
<v Speaker 3>Probably be a person that they could be</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

957
00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:56.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>
<v Speaker 3>the process is even,</v>

958
00:45:56.100 --> 00:46:00.270
<v Speaker 3>even an optimized process will be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

959
00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:06.340
<v Speaker 3>we'll record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will require a sacrifice of what</v>

960
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:10.680
<v Speaker 3>ordinary people want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the time that it will be an</v>

961
00:46:10.681 --> 00:46:13.480
<v Speaker 3>unusual personality who has to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>promoted and you will,</v>

962
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:17.160
<v Speaker 3>you will be on some metric be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

963
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:20.250
<v Speaker 3>it's almost by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>narcissistic to think that you should be</v>

964
00:46:20.251 --> 00:46:21.084
<v Speaker 3>in this role,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

965
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:25.980
<v Speaker 3>Who are you to think that you should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>running a civilization at this moment in</v>

966
00:46:25.981 --> 00:46:27.150
<v Speaker 3>human history?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

967
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:29.230
<v Speaker 3>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you to be on it,</v>

968
00:46:29.231 --> 00:46:31.920
<v Speaker 3>for you to honestly stand at the podium</v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

969
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:36.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm the guy or the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am the most qualified.</v>

970
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:38.340
<v Speaker 3>I should be doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

971
00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:40.240
<v Speaker 3>I can help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

972
00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.110
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to scrutinize the kind</v>

973
00:46:43.111 --> 00:46:46.200
<v Speaker 3>of personality that could give rise to</v>
<v Speaker 3>those opinions,</v>

974
00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.180
<v Speaker 3>it's not you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

975
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:50.640
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are some dials you would probably</v>

976
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:52.100
<v Speaker 3>want to change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tweak if you,</v>

977
00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:56.430
<v Speaker 3>if you had to be married to this person</v>
<v Speaker 3>or if it's not an optimal personality.</v>

978
00:46:56.431 --> 00:47:01.431
<v Speaker 3>So there's going to be kind of pathology</v>
<v Speaker 3>of power seeking that might be just</v>

979
00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:03.900
<v Speaker 3>intrinsic to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

980
00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:08.940
<v Speaker 3>you want someone who is actually wise</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethically.</v>

981
00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:09.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

982
00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.400
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just trying to map that onto</v>

983
00:47:11.401 --> 00:47:12.340
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

984
00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:15.360
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's imagined someone saying thing I</v>

985
00:47:15.361 --> 00:47:20.040
<v Speaker 3>like about trump is that he is so deeply</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical and wise.</v>

986
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.110
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

987
00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.960
<v Speaker 3>it does not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

988
00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.890
<v Speaker 3>it's like saying it's because his hair</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks so natural.</v>

989
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's just no,</v>

990
00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:31.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

991
00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.060
<v Speaker 3>is the antithesis of what he is.</v>

992
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:35.340
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

993
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:41.050
<v Speaker 3>the thing I like about trump is that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>is so well informed about the way the</v>

994
00:47:41.051 --> 00:47:42.620
<v Speaker 3>world works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

995
00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:47.800
<v Speaker 3>and where he's not informed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He recognizes his ignorance so quickly</v>

996
00:47:47.801 --> 00:47:50.800
<v Speaker 3>and he remedies that as fast as</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

997
00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:51.510
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

998
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:54.460
<v Speaker 3>he seeks out the best experts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>defers to them.</v>

999
00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1000
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just,</v>

1001
00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:01.810
<v Speaker 3>he's mindful of the limits of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge.</v>

1002
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:05.080
<v Speaker 3>Seo As,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as he is about his expertise and his</v>

1003
00:48:05.081 --> 00:48:06.640
<v Speaker 3>expertise is vast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1004
00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:09.520
<v Speaker 3>You'd want to be able to say that about</v>
<v Speaker 3>a president.</v>

1005
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:11.830
<v Speaker 3>You could not begin to say that about</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

1006
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.300
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1007
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:16.450
<v Speaker 3>you could probably say that honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could probably say that about</v>

1008
00:48:16.451 --> 00:48:17.300
<v Speaker 3>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1009
00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Like for Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all her defects,</v>

1010
00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:25.410
<v Speaker 3>she's very knowledgeable and I'm sure</v>
<v Speaker 3>she will just try it.</v>

1011
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:28.270
<v Speaker 3>Where she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where she doesn't feel like she's got</v>

1012
00:48:28.271 --> 00:48:30.110
<v Speaker 3>the knowledge he's going to try to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1013
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:31.480
<v Speaker 3>go to the source of the knowledge.</v>

1014
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.270
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just grab the best experts you can find.</v>

1015
00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she,</v>

1016
00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:41.940
<v Speaker 3>I think she will be as aware as you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be of the consequences of not</v>

1017
00:48:42.911 --> 00:48:44.110
<v Speaker 3>knowing what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1018
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:46.180
<v Speaker 3>She's just going to want to find out</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on.</v>

1019
00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:49.960
<v Speaker 3>Whereas this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean all trump has advertised about</v>

1020
00:48:49.961 --> 00:48:54.961
<v Speaker 3>himself is that he thinks that bluster</v>
<v Speaker 3>and banality and bullying will win in</v>

1021
00:48:59.231 --> 00:49:00.610
<v Speaker 3>every situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

1022
00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:04.810
<v Speaker 3>it's just attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy is the guy is winging it</v>

1023
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:10.470
<v Speaker 3>and it could not be more obvious that</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is winging it on every level.</v>

1024
00:49:10.481 --> 00:49:11.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's just,</v>

1025
00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:13.100
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is</v>

1026
00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.380
<v Speaker 3>not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There'd be no way for him to signal the</v>

1027
00:49:17.381 --> 00:49:21.850
<v Speaker 3>fact that he's winging it more clearly</v>
<v Speaker 3>than he is with everything he's doing.</v>

1028
00:49:21.851 --> 00:49:23.830
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yet there's no penalty.</v>

1029
00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's possible that in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>age of information,</v>

1030
00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.370
<v Speaker 1>the way we can communicate with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other that we're going to experience</v>

1031
00:49:30.371 --> 00:49:32.500
<v Speaker 1>these cycles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these waves,</v>

1032
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:37.530
<v Speaker 1>these in and outs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these high and low tides of really smart</v>

1033
00:49:38.351 --> 00:49:42.960
<v Speaker 1>presidents and really stupid president</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we just people revolt and there's</v>

1034
00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:45.490
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to stay alive is plenty of</v>

1035
00:49:45.491 --> 00:49:48.550
<v Speaker 1>students who fill out there and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're only willing to vote for other</v>

1036
00:49:48.551 --> 00:49:50.890
<v Speaker 1>dme folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the other dme folks get into</v>

1037
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:53.950
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They send out the frequency that only</v>

1038
00:49:53.951 --> 00:49:55.990
<v Speaker 1>the dummies here and everybody else is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

1039
00:49:55.991 --> 00:49:59.590
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is everybody voting for</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy for what is happening,</v>

1040
00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:04.060
<v Speaker 1>and then it makes the smart people</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebound and for years and challenge</v>

1041
00:50:04.061 --> 00:50:08.170
<v Speaker 1>themselves a new because they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need some sort of an enemy to rally</v>

1042
00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:12.880
<v Speaker 1>against to reach their full potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that without the low tide you cannot</v>

1043
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:16.690
<v Speaker 1>have the high tide Sam Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hopefully.</v>

1044
00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:20.950
<v Speaker 1>That's not an analogy that applies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the maintenance of civilization.</v>

1045
00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.750
<v Speaker 1>The smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:26.160
<v Speaker 1>The time man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe at the very least it's a wakeup</v>

1047
00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:29.690
<v Speaker 1>call for the establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This silly game that you've been running</v>

1048
00:50:29.691 --> 00:50:32.060
<v Speaker 1>have two candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just doesn't work.</v>

1049
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Someone can cooperate your candidacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get in there,</v>

1050
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:37.610
<v Speaker 1>throw the fucking monkey wrench into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gear system,</v>

1051
00:50:37.611 --> 00:50:39.500
<v Speaker 1>and guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump's running for president now.</v>

1052
00:50:39.501 --> 00:50:40.610
<v Speaker 1>He's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the head,</v>

1053
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:44.120
<v Speaker 1>he's the head guy for the Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is that even possible?</v>

1054
00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:46.270
<v Speaker 3>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met with amazing.</v>

1055
00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:47.890
<v Speaker 3>It is a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if nothing else,</v>

1056
00:50:47.891 --> 00:50:49.840
<v Speaker 3>it has a total wakeup call for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans.</v>

1057
00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:51.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean they are just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's June aghast.</v>

1058
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:52.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1059
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.580
<v Speaker 1>it's June.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's decided locked down.</v>

1060
00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.040
<v Speaker 1>So we have July,</v>
<v Speaker 1>August,</v>

1061
00:50:58.041 --> 00:50:59.510
<v Speaker 1>September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>October,</v>

1062
00:50:59.511 --> 00:51:01.550
<v Speaker 1>November.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're that close.</v>

1063
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:08.650
<v Speaker 3>But he's not someone who has been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is aligned with the Republican</v>

1064
00:51:08.751 --> 00:51:13.160
<v Speaker 3>platform in most ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1065
00:51:13.161 --> 00:51:18.161
<v Speaker 3>So it's like he's been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Truth is virtually no one knows what his</v>

1066
00:51:18.921 --> 00:51:22.490
<v Speaker 3>policies are because he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he keeps changing his position on things</v>

1067
00:51:22.491 --> 00:51:24.470
<v Speaker 3>like taxation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if there actually is no keys.</v>

1068
00:51:24.471 --> 00:51:27.350
<v Speaker 3>He said he's talked to on both sides of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1069
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.020
<v Speaker 3>of core issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>core Republican issues.</v>

1070
00:51:30.021 --> 00:51:32.380
<v Speaker 3>But</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1071
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:35.600
<v Speaker 3>in many ways he's left of Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1072
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:36.530
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1073
00:51:36.531 --> 00:51:39.860
<v Speaker 3>he's left of Hillary in terms of being</v>
<v Speaker 3>an isolationist.</v>

1074
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:40.690
<v Speaker 3>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1075
00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:42.230
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1076
00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:47.320
<v Speaker 3>his relationship to war is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but both extremes.</v>

1077
00:51:47.361 --> 00:51:48.194
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

1078
00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.550
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just going to,</v>

1079
00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.070
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get out of the world's</v>
<v Speaker 3>business,</v>

1080
00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:53.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to be isolationists,</v>

1081
00:51:53.451 --> 00:51:56.670
<v Speaker 3>which is deeply anti Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1082
00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:00.710
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to be the maniac who</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to know who I'm going</v>

1083
00:52:00.711 --> 00:52:01.460
<v Speaker 3>to bomb next.</v>

1084
00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.050
<v Speaker 3>We're going to keep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to wipe out isis.</v>

1085
00:52:03.051 --> 00:52:04.430
<v Speaker 3>We're just straight away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1086
00:52:04.431 --> 00:52:06.470
<v Speaker 3>Did Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a man left standing.</v>

1087
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:10.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not gonna take any shit from</v>

1088
00:52:10.161 --> 00:52:13.490
<v Speaker 3>anyone including China and North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he's that.</v>

1089
00:52:13.491 --> 00:52:17.600
<v Speaker 3>But we're going to pull back in a huge</v>
<v Speaker 3>way and not be in anyone's business,</v>

1090
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:19.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said both of those things.</v>

1091
00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:22.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1092
00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.940
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's way too interesting way.</v>

1093
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:32.390
<v Speaker 3>We don't want politics to be this</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting and it's going to be</v>

1094
00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:37.220
<v Speaker 3>November is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the polls are closed and watching</v>

1095
00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:38.460
<v Speaker 3>those debates and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1096
00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:39.530
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1097
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting for a swing in the polls,</v>

1098
00:52:41.931 --> 00:52:43.370
<v Speaker 3>as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be,</v>

1099
00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.530
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be way too interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's gonna be like watching the</v>

1100
00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.180
<v Speaker 3>superbowl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those first debates,</v>

1101
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:49.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be 100 million people</v>

1102
00:52:49.911 --> 00:52:53.870
<v Speaker 3>watching those debates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a prediction.</v>

1103
00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.120
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1104
00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:02.370
<v Speaker 1>I think it's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole thing was a plot that didn't</v>

1105
00:53:02.371 --> 00:53:06.030
<v Speaker 1>work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he probably came out of the gate</v>

1106
00:53:06.031 --> 00:53:10.890
<v Speaker 1>saying crazy shit thinking he would tank</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republican Party and get his friend</v>

1107
00:53:10.891 --> 00:53:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton into the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did it.</v>

1108
00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't tend to work out.</v>

1109
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:19.020
<v Speaker 1>He kept trying to insult her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept trying to make stuff up about</v>

1110
00:53:19.021 --> 00:53:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Mexicans and it just kept making them</v>
<v Speaker 1>get better and better and now he's</v>

1111
00:53:22.401 --> 00:53:23.234
<v Speaker 1>stuck.</v>

1112
00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:26.970
<v Speaker 3>He can't pull out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be.</v>

1113
00:53:26.971 --> 00:53:29.100
<v Speaker 3>That would be a great moment and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>would change the system.</v>

1114
00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:31.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have to go through</v>

1115
00:53:31.051 --> 00:53:33.660
<v Speaker 3>something like this in order for us to</v>
<v Speaker 3>realize that this is crazy,</v>

1116
00:53:33.661 --> 00:53:36.750
<v Speaker 3>that a guy can just do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can just not really have any interest in</v>

1117
00:53:36.751 --> 00:53:39.960
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Until then he should get the Nobel prize</v>

1118
00:53:39.961 --> 00:53:42.390
<v Speaker 3>for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he pulls out at this point and says,</v>

1119
00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:45.090
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just took you to the precipice here,</v>

1120
00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:50.610
<v Speaker 3>just because I wanted you to recognize</v>
<v Speaker 3>how unstable this situation is.</v>

1121
00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1122
00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:56.740
<v Speaker 3>you guys could elect a demagogue who is</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually an incoherent demagogue.</v>

1123
00:53:59.041 --> 00:54:00.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't even been playing an</v>

1124
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:02.520
<v Speaker 3>incoherent authoritarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1125
00:54:02.521 --> 00:54:03.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1126
00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:04.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1127
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:08.730
<v Speaker 3>on one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very liberal,</v>

1128
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:11.010
<v Speaker 3>right and tolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on the other hand,</v>

1129
00:54:11.011 --> 00:54:15.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm like getting ready to be Hitler and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys can't figure out who I am and</v>

1130
00:54:15.331 --> 00:54:16.920
<v Speaker 3>yet you're still prepared to vote for</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

1131
00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1132
00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:22.110
<v Speaker 3>for him to do a postmortem on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on his punking of,</v>

1133
00:54:22.210 --> 00:54:26.160
<v Speaker 3>of the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be the best thing to ever</v>

1134
00:54:26.161 --> 00:54:28.400
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think that's,</v>

1135
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:30.990
<v Speaker 3>that's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we need someone like this.</v>

1136
00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.080
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we realized how silly this whole thing</v>

1137
00:54:34.081 --> 00:54:34.741
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we need.</v>

1138
00:54:34.741 --> 00:54:35.520
<v Speaker 3>Some are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1139
00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:39.690
<v Speaker 3>we need a qualified person to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the other hassles and dangers</v>

1140
00:54:39.691 --> 00:54:41.820
<v Speaker 3>that are coming our way that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing to do with,</v>

1141
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:45.390
<v Speaker 3>with what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that person's not there.</v>

1142
00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Even if we were doing everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly,</v>

1143
00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:54.290
<v Speaker 3>they would still be this tsunami of risk</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hassle and</v>

1144
00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:01.230
<v Speaker 3>waste and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1145
00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:05.100
<v Speaker 3>just all the rest of the world chaos</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is coming our way.</v>

1146
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:09.180
<v Speaker 3>And it just forget even if we had our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our house in order,</v>

1147
00:55:09.181 --> 00:55:14.181
<v Speaker 3>in every respect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we still have terrorism and the global</v>

1148
00:55:14.371 --> 00:55:15.450
<v Speaker 3>climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1149
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:17.550
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got China and India and what are</v>

1150
00:55:17.551 --> 00:55:21.150
<v Speaker 3>they doing in terms of complying with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1151
00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:22.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>climate goals?</v>

1152
00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:26.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have all the things we've been</v>

1153
00:55:26.101 --> 00:55:29.780
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the virtual certainty that there's going</v>

1154
00:55:29.781 --> 00:55:32.040
<v Speaker 3>to be a pandemic at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the not want to talking about</v>

1155
00:55:32.041 --> 00:55:34.710
<v Speaker 3>bioterrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about just the sheer fact</v>

1156
00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:39.090
<v Speaker 3>that in 1919 there was a killer flu and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gonna be another killer.</v>

1157
00:55:39.091 --> 00:55:40.650
<v Speaker 3>Flew right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just no way.</v>

1158
00:55:40.651 --> 00:55:41.780
<v Speaker 3>There's not going to be another killer</v>
<v Speaker 3>flu.</v>

1159
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:45.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we need,</v>

1160
00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:50.570
<v Speaker 3>we need people and we need people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to smart people to change the,</v>

1161
00:55:50.571 --> 00:55:53.370
<v Speaker 3>to optimize the system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to deal with these kinds of things.</v>

1162
00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:58.460
<v Speaker 3>And if we're promoting religious maniacs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1163
00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:03.600
<v Speaker 3>and crazy narcissists and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>liars,</v>

1164
00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:07.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ignoramuses and only that,</v>

1165
00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:11.200
<v Speaker 3>those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could this end will know this is</v>

1166
00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:14.130
<v Speaker 3>just a weird year for leg heavyweight</v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing,</v>

1167
00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:17.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have those weird years for Tony.</v>

1168
00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:22.260
<v Speaker 3>And then were you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could be the heavyweight champion of</v>

1169
00:56:22.261 --> 00:56:23.920
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went through a period of time</v>

1170
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.020
<v Speaker 1>in the early eighties for Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came around,</v>

1171
00:56:26.021 --> 00:56:28.510
<v Speaker 1>was a series of like these champs that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

1172
00:56:28.530 --> 00:56:30.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like journeymen fighters.</v>

1173
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:32.560
<v Speaker 1>And then Tyson came along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what it is,</v>

1174
00:56:32.561 --> 00:56:34.300
<v Speaker 1>but only with only with heavy weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1175
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly with heavyweights.</v>

1176
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1177
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:38.620
<v Speaker 1>And the lighter weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were always bad ass.</v>

1178
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:40.600
<v Speaker 1>But I think that maybe that's what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

1179
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we need to have this bad season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the season out of our way,</v>

1180
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:48.790
<v Speaker 1>realize the danger of having an inept</v>
<v Speaker 1>person in office,</v>

1181
00:56:48.791 --> 00:56:52.330
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a liar or a dude who hates</v>
<v Speaker 1>money or,</v>

1182
00:56:52.331 --> 00:56:54.250
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or trump or whoever it is.</v>

1183
00:56:54.251 --> 00:56:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Just go through it and realize how silly</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that we have it set up this way</v>

1184
00:56:58.091 --> 00:56:58.450
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>
