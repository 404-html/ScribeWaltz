Hello Ladies and gentlemen and everybody else.
It's up.

2
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:10.440
Fuckers.
This episode is brought to you by legal zoom.

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Legal Zoom is a a pretty awesome service and what it is is a website,

4
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.460
essentially a self help website that allows you to do a lot of the things that

5
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:27.150
you would ordinarily have to go to an attorney's office to handle.

6
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.500
You can do it yourself online.
They will divvy,

7
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.680
they were developed by top attorneys to provide self help services at your

8
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:38.730
specific direction.
It's not a legal firm,
it's not a law firm,

9
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.030
but they provide you with legal self help and they can also provide you with a

10
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:48.810
contact for a third party independent attorney if the shit hits the fan.

11
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.860
And what does this mean?
It means that like if you want to form an LLC,

12
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.530
if you want to incorporate,
if you want to get a will,

13
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.170
a power of attorney living trust,
things along those lines,

14
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.120
you can do all that step by step on legal zoom.
And it's very easy to do.

15
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.810
I know a lot of people who have done that on it was formed that way.
Uh,

16
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.150
Brian formed his desk squad company.
That way,

17
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:13.530
all that is done through legal zoom.
Super easy to do.

18
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.860
There's a lot of things that you would ordinarily have to go to a lawyer.

19
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:19.710
You'd have to put your clothes on,
you'd have to make an appointment.

20
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:23.790
You could be naked drunk at home and do legal stuff.
It's amazing,

21
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.120
amazing and not very expensive.
Uh,

22
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:30.540
you can form an LLC from 99 bucks.
Uh,

23
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.350
they've been helping Americans get personal wills,
power of attorney,

24
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.310
doing all that stuff for over 10 years,

25
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:39.750
and they have an a plus from the better business bureau,
which to me is giant.

26
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.750
You know,
they don't just give those away.
So I liked that.

27
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.820
I know people that have used this service.

28
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.910
I liked that my friends have used this service and I liked that.

29
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.280
I just hear nothing but good things about them.

30
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.540
You can even get a divorce if you know the other person you're going to get

31
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.320
divorce with is really cool.
But if they're not,

32
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.870
and then if they're really that cool,

33
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:02.640
why are you divorcing him the fuck you doing?

34
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.800
I wonder how many people have gotten divorced through legal zoom.

35
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:08.760
It's probably be like three.
I might be wrong,
but you could do it.
Um,

36
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.550
so go there,
go to legalzoom.com.

40
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:27.120
It's a sweet fucking website.
I really enjoyed legal zoom.

41
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:31.950
I liked the fact that there's a lot of things that you know you used to be super

42
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:36.870
inconvenient to deal with,
like simple legal issues like forming a corporation.

43
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:38.580
You can do all of that now.

44

45
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.400

46
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.980

48
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:58.350

I got a new batch of naturebox,
Jamie.
Oh,

49
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:00.220
you're going to love all this new

50
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.280
<v 1>groovy shit we got.
But no Sriracha.
Cashews.</v>

51
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.420
I've fucking talk too much about Serratia cashews and now you bitches all buy

52
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:09.970
them up.
They know Sriracha cashews left.

53
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:11.800
We're fucking killing the cashew farmers.

54
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.900
There was poor cashew farmers and those Porsche Rochan makers,

55
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.880
their work a double,

56
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.810
triple overtime sweating their balls off trying to make serratia cashews.

57
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.760
But there's,
what's that?
Yeah,
we all need some blueberry Ahmond's though.

58
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.320
Dark cocoa almonds.
If you had those.
Oh good lord and peanut butter,

59
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:31.540
nom noms.
They might be my new favorite.
Peter.
Pardon?

60
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:34.870
Num noms might take the place of Serratia cashews but I shouldn't tell you

61
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:38.830
fuckers cause then you buy them all up to,
uh,
what naturebox is,

62
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:43.330
is you order it online and you pick the stuff that you want and then they send

63
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:45.580
you boxes every week and here's the deal behind it.

64
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.420
If you are a person that works in an office and you have one of those goddamn

65
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.710
vending machines attempts you,

66
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:53.920
you kind of hungry and you walk by and like the most healthy thing in there,

67
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:57.400
it's like some shitty as Granola bar and you know,

68
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:59.620
that's not what you want to eat.
And he definitely don't want to eat candy,

69
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:01.720
but you wind up doing it just because you're hungry.

70
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.270
Naturebox gives you hundreds and I mean hundreds of delicious snacks to choose

71
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:08.650
from.

72
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.340
Really good stuff and there's a lot of stuff that you don't have to feel guilty

73
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:12.940
about.

74
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.990
There's a few things that are a bit questionable if you'd pretzels and things

75
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.090
along those lines are not necessarily good for you,

76
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.370
but they have zero trans fats,
zero high fructose corn syrup,

77
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:27.910
all that stuff that's really shitty for your body,
low in sugar.

78
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.780
You can get plenty of them that are low in sugar and non GMO and without gluten

79
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.710
and they shipped for free.
Um,
peanut butter nom nom is,
like I said,

80
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:38.380
are my favorites,
but there's so many good ones.

81
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:41.290
The blueberry Ahmond's or to live in the big apple pie,
big island,

82
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:42.820
pineapples are fantastic.

83
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.110
There's a lot of really healthy choices that you could choose from that are

84
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:48.550
delicious.
They're really good.

85
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.950
I've signed up a bunch of friends on naturebox.com and you know,
they,

86
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.300
no one's complaining.
Everybody's enjoying the shit out of it.

87
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:56.650
Brian's completely addicted to it.

88
00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.420
That fucker doesn't even go food shopping anymore.
He just buys naturebox.

89
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.900
It hasn't stacked around a second house.

90
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.750
It needs to go to a God damn grocery store.

91
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:06.700
He wonders why he's not feeling good all the time.

92
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Fucking dude's smoking cigarettes and eating snacks like a God damn meal.

93
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.240
But in between meals,
naturebox is seriously the way to go.

94
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.230
It's the official snack provider for a the Joe Rogan experience podcast.

95
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:21.790
We have them laying around the office right now.

96
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:23.320

And last but not least,

108
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:05.030
we're brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com that is o.N n.
I.
T.

109
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.790
We are a human optimization website.

110
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.260
And on it we sell all of the very best in strength and conditioning equipment

111
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:14.330
and supplements,
athletic supplements,

112
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:17.360
supplements that are designed to help you improve your performance,

113
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.830
both in cognitive function,
uh,
your physical fitness performance,

114
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:25.970
your endurance.
We have,
uh,
things that aid in recovery.

115
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.300
We just find one of the best shit that we can find online,

116
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.180
whether it's a athletic equipment,

117
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.980
like a battle ropes or kettle bells or things along those lines,

118
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:37.814
medicine balls,

119
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.560
all things that provide what we call functional strength and what functional

120
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:44.300
strength is the IB.

121
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.950
The idea behind functional strength is athletic equipment and exercises that

122
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.930
improve performance in any given task.
Like,
um,
like if you do bicep curls,

123
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:57.380
it's not necessarily going to help you do Jujitsu or it's not going to

124
00:06:57.381 --> 00:06:59.870
necessarily help you throw punches better.
It's gonna make your arms look bigger,

125
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:01.700
you little fucking sexy at the beach and shit.

126
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.560
But the reality of athletic performance is your body has to move as one

127
00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:10.620
individual unit,
all parts moving together to enhance your w,

128
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.050
your athletic performance,

129
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:15.440
not just your ability to lift weights in a very specific and isolated way.

130
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.550
And uh,
that's what kettle bells are all about.
I'm a huge fan of kettlebells.

131
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.740
If you've heard this podcast before,
you'd probably like,

132
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:24.560
we shut the fuck up about Kettlebells,
Jesus Christ son.

133
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.950
But I just think that these a bad fucking Russians,

134
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:31.520
they figured out some cool shit.
Um,
and they figured out a long time ago,

135
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.600
one of the best ways to improve athletic performance is this thing called the

136
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:37.940
kettle bell.
It's like a bowling ball,

137
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.370
an iron bowling ball with a handle on the top of it.

138
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.210
And it's all about swinging these things around and it's all about overcoming a

139
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:47.360
nurse Hsa and using your whole body and these explosive movements.

140
00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:52.310
And it is just absolutely fantastic for developing full body strength,

141
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:56.680
like full body strength where you can just move couches easier.
You know,

142
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.900
if you're doing any sort of a sport,
whether it's tennis or you know,
anything,

143
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.880
you will have more physical strength to draw upon.
Um,
and uh,

144
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.840
we sell the very best ones that we can find,

145
00:08:05.841 --> 00:08:09.830
including the primal bells and the Zombie Bells,
which are two,

146
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:13.550
a artistic kettle bells that we had designed.
Um,
we had a,

147
00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:15.740
the primal bells designed to the great apes.

148
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.530
It's a chimpanzees how we are monkeys,

149
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.610
Orangutans and gorillas,
uh,

150
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:26.170
all various weights from 18 pounds up to 72 pounds and uh,

151
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.700
they're all three d balanced as well.
Um,
you,

152
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:31.480
there's some artistic kettle bells that are out there,
uh,

153
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.680
from other companies and they look really cool.

154
00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:38.420
But the reality is you want a kettle bell to be completely symmetrically

155
00:08:38.421 --> 00:08:40.370
balanced so that when you're swinging it,

156
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.240
there's not like some weird momentum that comes from the,
the odd shape of it.

157
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.900
We designed these kettlebells to make sure that not only do they look great,

158
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.380
but they function the exact same way as regular kettle bells.

159
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.300
So either prepare for the gorilla,

160
00:08:53.301 --> 00:08:56.880
take over or the Zombie apocalypse with primal bells or Zombie bells.

161
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.510
And then get your freak on at [inaudible] dot com that's o,
n n I t,

162
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.540
use the Codeword Rogan and you will save 10% off any and all supplements.

163
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.500
All right.
That's it.
And of commercials.
Robin motherfucker blockers,

164
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.980
acutely music,
young Jamie landscape,

165
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.010
the Joe Rogan experience.

166
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.020
<v 2>Try by day Joe Rogan podcast by night.</v>

167
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.680
<v 1>There's very few people in this life can say that they've gone from Glam rock to</v>

168
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.890
expert MMA commentary and even fighting in MMA.

169
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.830
Very few people other than you,
Robin black.

170
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.800
<v 3>There might be some lady out there,
so check that out out.
Yeah,
it's pretty weird.</v>

171
00:09:38.801 --> 00:09:42.790
I,
I tend to try to do stuff that I like.
That's kind of my goal in life.

172
00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:43.890
Just do a bunch of stuff.
I like.

173
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.570
<v 1>That's a beautiful goal,
man.
And if everybody did that,</v>

174
00:09:46.571 --> 00:09:49.730
we would have a lot more happy people in this world.
Yeah,
right,
right.
Yeah.

175
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.110
You do a fantastic job.
You work for the fight network in Canada,
right?
Yeah.

176
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:58.320
And you do a fantastic job of breaking down fights and your enthusiasm is so

177
00:09:58.361 --> 00:09:59.890
contagious.
It's really cool.

178
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:05.050
It's really enjoyed watching those videos because as a person myself who's a

179
00:10:05.051 --> 00:10:07.690
huge fan of fights and just just,

180
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:12.940
there's so many aspects that I think that maybe the casual fan might miss or the

181
00:10:12.941 --> 00:10:17.800
person who was never trained or competed my miss and you do a great job of sort

182
00:10:17.801 --> 00:10:22.120
of encapsulating those really important moments and and and highlighting them

183
00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:25.810
and isolating them and you do it all with passion.
It's really fun

184
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.170
<v 3>man.
Thank you.
That is the coolest thing anyone's ever said to me.
Like I just,</v>

185
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:33.760
I really fucking love doing these things.
Like you could tell.
Yeah,

186
00:10:33.761 --> 00:10:38.710
I do like to spend hours sitting there and look at how beautifully these guys

187
00:10:38.711 --> 00:10:42.340
moves in the moment in time where too unwilling guys are like,

188
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:46.270
they each are trying to choreograph their own thing and what's going on

189
00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:49.930
psychically and what's going on mentally like it.
Honest to God,

190
00:10:49.931 --> 00:10:54.130
I've done a lot of fun things and they all seem to kind of lead to this.

191
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.740
And if I could only do one thing for the rest of my life,

192
00:10:56.741 --> 00:11:00.670
I'd spend my time in my little lab researching what's going on when two men

193
00:11:00.671 --> 00:11:04.060
fight.
Like that's what I do with my life and that's what I do now.

194
00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:06.640
And I absolutely love doing it.

195
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.300
<v 1>Yeah,
you could tell and I'm like I said,</v>

196
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.370
as someone like me who is also a huge fan of MMA and a huge,
uh,

197
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:19.260
a huge fan of watching two people trying to figure each other out in the most

198
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:23.670
dangerous and most,
uh,
the most high stake sport I think in the world,

199
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.660
maybe not the most dangerous as far as like,
I mean,

200
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.710
I guess like maybe Nascar is probably more dangerous,
dangerous,

201
00:11:28.711 --> 00:11:33.540
but the high stakes of the human hand to hand combat,

202
00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:35.430
to me,
there's so much on the line,

203
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.690
there's so much psychologically going on and there's so many little things.

204
00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:43.680
Like I'm sure there's a lot that I'm missing if I watch basketball.

205
00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:45.900
I'm sure there's a lot that I'm missing.
If you watch football,

206
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.160
but when it comes to striking and grappling and mixed martial arts,

207
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.590
the variables are so,

208
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:58.060
and the different approaches to overcoming those variables is so gigantic.

209
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:03.060
Like you did a recent thing on Gunnar Nelson and a gunner Nelson who is a

210
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.740
Jujitsu expert and now an MMA fighter out of Iceland.
Yeah.

211
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.410
Who's a really interesting dude.
Like super stoic.
Yeah.
Yeah.

212
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:16.150
Fucking cold as ice.
Never smiles.
Never laughs.
He's,
he's a weird dude,

213
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.660
but wicked Jujitsu.
I remember him from the,

214
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.800
just before he ever got into MMA or high level MMA.
Um,

215
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:28.080
he beat my fucking Monton.
Yeah.
Cool.
Real love.

216
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.240
I remember seeing this little guy on monsoons back.
I'm like,

217
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:34.090
who is that motherfucker?
Like that guy is a beast.

218
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.940
How do you take Jeff Monsoons back?

219
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.000
<v 3>Yeah.
And it's,
it,
that calmness.</v>

220
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:43.260
He uses that so intelligently.
Like I was,
I'm reading this will,

221
00:12:43.261 --> 00:12:46.830
have you heard of this book?
The rise of Superman?
No.
Oh Dude,

222
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.780
look to read this book immediately.

223
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.490
So this guy goes and he has researched the biochemistry that's happening in the

224
00:12:53.491 --> 00:12:55.110
brain at the opera,

225
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.800
at the moments where people feel like a surfer feels like at one with the wave,

226
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.560
you know where I free climb or feels at one with the wall,

227
00:13:01.561 --> 00:13:06.230
there's actually biochemistry happening in the brain and there's four for a

228
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.490
neurotransmitters that are released simultaneously.

229
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:13.110
And in that moment there's all of these things that humans do better.
Uh,

230
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:17.130
one of them is pattern recognition.
So when two guys are fighting,

231
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.610
you can see patterns in how they move and predict outcomes,
right?

232
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.050
And got a different guys get into it in different ways.

233
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.230
The bulk of the research is on action and sports,

234
00:13:28.231 --> 00:13:32.100
like flipping motorcycles through the air five times and stuff.
Cause those guys,

235
00:13:32.101 --> 00:13:36.780
if they are not in that state,
they die,
right?
So the level now,

236
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.960
like there's exponential growth in what people can now do in that state because

237
00:13:42.181 --> 00:13:45.810
it's being sort of a global experiment that men are pushing each other further

238
00:13:45.811 --> 00:13:50.550
and further.
I mean,
everybody used to gather around to see,
um,
uh,

239
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.350
evil.
Knievel jumped 10 buses.

240
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.080
Now everyday 10 guys do that and flipped four times while doing it,
you know?

241
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.800
So the level of what people are able to mentally accomplish.

242
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.680
So that's happening in fighting and the thing,

243
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:05.310
and I'm obsessed with science so that what's going on physically is fascinating

244
00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:06.420
what's going on psychologically,

245
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.530
but the science has crazy and that's kind of where my research is going now.

246
00:14:10.531 --> 00:14:15.120
Like if you could take an EEG and put it on their brain in the highest moments

247
00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:16.770
of combat,
what's going on in,

248
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.770
<v 1>I wonder if you ever could do that because if they were in that highest one</v>

249
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.030
would combat and they had an EEG on their brain,
would they be thinking the same?

250
00:14:23.031 --> 00:14:26.440
Because what they realize they had an EEG and what did distract them?
In

251
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.280
<v 3>theory,</v>

252
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:31.350
if all these people screaming and you sit in at the side of the cage and wearing

253
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.690
your underpants getting punched in the face,
if all that isn't distracting,

254
00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:39.190
a couple of things on your head.
It's hard to say though.
I mean the state,

255
00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:39.630
what you want,

256
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:44.200
what you want to check with that EEG or something is the mental state of the

257
00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:46.810
biochemistry,
the neurology happening in the brain.

258
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.660
And if they're not in that state,
you can't do it.

259
00:14:49.661 --> 00:14:50.770
But people have done it in other,

260
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.780
they've done it and looked at what's happening in the brain and there's

261
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:57.200
something called dumb,
a hypo frontal ism.

262
00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:01.000
We're actually less as happening in the front of your brain during these moments

263
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.390
of like perfect performance.
And that's what this book's about.
This guy is like,

264
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.870
like chemically analyzing the highest level of performance.

265
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.770
So to take that into fighting,
these guys are operating at that level now.

266
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.970
Like the top guys,
Carlos Condit is operating at that level.
You know,

267
00:15:16.971 --> 00:15:21.971
he's operating in moments of pure flow and when these guys are in those moments,

268
00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:25.280
what's happening in that?
That's shit's fascinating.

269
00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:29.600
Like to look at fights and under and look and see that these guys are operating

270
00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:32.780
at the highest level of human performance and in that state against each other,

271
00:15:32.781 --> 00:15:34.160
they're fighting each other.
It's crazy.

272
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.510
<v 1>Yeah,
it's really fascinating.
Um,</v>

273
00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:41.010
the book is called the rise of Superman and it's by a guy named Steven Kotler

274
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.750
and uh,
it's got four and a half stars on amazon.com.
So that's a,
that's a pretty,

275
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:45.851
<v 3>it's a great book.</v>

276
00:15:45.851 --> 00:15:49.330
I'm going to do a little breakdown on what's going on with pattern recognition

277
00:15:49.331 --> 00:15:50.140
in that state.

278
00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:55.090
And imagine you and I are both in that state and you know that I'm starting to

279
00:15:55.091 --> 00:15:56.230
recognize patterns.

280
00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:00.430
You can lay traps for me by doing something called chunking where you'll go one,

281
00:16:00.431 --> 00:16:00.911
two,
three,

282
00:16:00.911 --> 00:16:05.560
four and all start to recognize that pattern and anticipate it and you'll change

283
00:16:05.561 --> 00:16:08.800
one thing.
That pattern in hidden,
right?
So chunking,
use,

284
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.730
understanding that I'm predicting your patterns and using that against me,

285
00:16:12.731 --> 00:16:15.420
like all of that kind of stuff just fascinates the shit out of me.
Right.

286
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.510
<v 1>Well that's always been a big thing about striking,</v>

287
00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:22.511
about changing up the speed of your approach and also throwing faints in

288
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.600
pretending to go one way and going another.

289
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.610
There's all sorts of different things that people have done to try to offset

290
00:16:28.611 --> 00:16:29.120
pattern rec

291
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.210
<v 3>mission and each other's brains like your,
your brain.</v>

292
00:16:32.211 --> 00:16:33.800
The better your brain performs,

293
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.280
the different I have to approach to make you pay for having such a good

294
00:16:37.281 --> 00:16:41.520
performing brain.
You know what I mean?
Like your brain can anticipate stuff.

295
00:16:41.521 --> 00:16:45.290
So I need to make you make that a bad thing for you.
Wow.

296
00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.670
<v 1>You know,
so it's what it says here at Fau.</v>

297
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:52.540
That flow is caused by a mighty cocktail,
five powerful chemicals from dopamine,

298
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.820
serotonin.
And that's interesting that I've never really thought about it,
that,

299
00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:01.350
that the have all these chemicals flowing together.

300
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.190
I've always thought of it as just sort of a quote unquote state of mind that you

301
00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:06.210
achieve a state of mind.

302
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.380
But this state of mind being a bunch of neural transmitters are flowing together

303
00:17:10.381 --> 00:17:11.460
and the optimum level.

304
00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:14.540
<v 3>Yeah,
man.
Like think of that.
The way,
uh,
like this,</v>

305
00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.690
your state of mind affects your emotion and your emotion affects your

306
00:17:18.691 --> 00:17:22.890
biochemistry and your biochemistry affects your performance.
So it's,

307
00:17:22.891 --> 00:17:27.060
they're linked to each other.
So that idea that guys get focused,

308
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.840
that focus causes a biochemical change and the brand,

309
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.550
this is the kind of Shit I want to go to next on my breakdowns.

310
00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.130
And they start playing with this kind of stuff and evolutionary things.

311
00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.670
You've probably read that the hand part of the reason that evolved the way it

312
00:17:38.671 --> 00:17:39.990
did was for fighting.

313
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:45.170
We read that in the jaw and stuff exactly like so start looking at what that

314
00:17:45.751 --> 00:17:48.930
means and why they're like the science of that kind of stuff is just starting to

315
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:49.840
my mind.

316
00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.590
<v 1>It is totally fascinating stuff and it's also the,</v>

317
00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.600
the thing about this achieving this flow state that's so maddening for people is

318
00:17:57.941 --> 00:18:01.570
that it's,
it just slips through your fingers.
It's there and it's gone.

319
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.890
It's you achieve these brief moments where you've seen it in basketball games

320
00:18:05.891 --> 00:18:07.570
where a guy just feels like you can't mass.

321
00:18:07.571 --> 00:18:10.360
He hits those three partners from the outside in pool.

322
00:18:10.361 --> 00:18:15.040
I played pool a lot in you've,
there's these moments,
they're rare and fleeting,

323
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:19.210
but when they come it's like you can't miss it.
You know where everything is,

324
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:20.490
<v 3>be willing to bat.</v>

325
00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:24.780
You're in that state some huge percentage of time when you're doing comedy

326
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.070
because once you read about it,

327
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.740
there's a whole bunch of confidence that how it affects your way,

328
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:34.560
your inhibitions,
and your unwillingness to to use inhibitions.

329
00:18:34.561 --> 00:18:38.100
You're probably in that state almost always when you're hitting it in comedy.

330
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.680
<v 1>Yeah,
I would think so.
Because when you're doing comedy,</v>

331
00:18:40.681 --> 00:18:44.510
I've always described it as you're more like a passenger,
right?

332
00:18:44.511 --> 00:18:46.860
Then you are like the pilot.
You were all just,

333
00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:49.920
you just kind of like doing it and like sometimes words will come out of your

334
00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:50.754
mouth and you're like,

335
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:55.380
I don't even know if I could take credit for those words because I guess it's

336
00:18:55.381 --> 00:18:59.700
not,
I know it's me.
It's coming out of my mouth.
I know it's my voice.
I know.

337
00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:02.910
I know.
Technically I created them,
I wrote them,

338
00:19:02.911 --> 00:19:06.780
but it's not really me that's doing it.
It's like it's just coming out on its own

339
00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:07.480
<v 3>and,</v>

340
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.570
and a guy who catches an enormous killer wave will say exactly the same thing.

341
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.170
And a guy who walks a tight rope over top of Niagara Falls will say the same

342
00:19:15.171 --> 00:19:17.600
thing.
You're going into that state in that time.

343
00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.900
<v 1>Yeah,
I would imagine.
And in Jujitsu you see it as well,</v>

344
00:19:20.901 --> 00:19:22.460
like when guys are rolling,

345
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.360
there's moments where you know like there's a certain transition,

346
00:19:26.361 --> 00:19:29.180
like someone will hit the over under,

347
00:19:29.181 --> 00:19:32.390
the guy will try to escape a flow immediately to an arm bar and then immediately

348
00:19:32.391 --> 00:19:34.160
to a triangle and it's all happening so fast.

349
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.590
It's almost impossible for that person to be thinking.

350
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:41.860
They're just reacting and hitting those moves and just completely like in that

351
00:19:42.021 --> 00:19:42.854
zone.

352
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.860
<v 3>One of the aspects of flow state is that Eh,
you,
you interpret time differently.</v>

353
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.350
So you'll hear that from a lot of fighters.

354
00:19:49.351 --> 00:19:54.090
I mean one of the things I think that helps me analyze stuff is that when I

355
00:19:54.091 --> 00:19:58.080
fought,
I had success in a terrible failures,

356
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:02.670
like terrible embarrassing.
Changing who you are as a man.

357
00:20:02.671 --> 00:20:07.200
Failures.
How many times,
you know,
nine.
Yeah.
And the one for them,
I'm,

358
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.700
I'm going to do one last fight.

359
00:20:08.701 --> 00:20:13.410
I'm going to end five wins at 45 five wins and five losses.

360
00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:18.210
You're sure?
I'm sure.
I'm sure.
Hey Man,
I have to get to 10.

361
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.680
I mean,
but I'm telling you,

362
00:20:19.681 --> 00:20:24.300
I had the kind of losses that make you question who you are as a man.

363
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:25.710
You know what I mean?

364
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.760
For four days or weeks or affect your pop into your head experiencing that.

365
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.960
I think that's an analyst's life.
Like I've had a flow state.

366
00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.950
My last fight I won in the second round.

367
00:20:37.951 --> 00:20:41.790
I literally completely did whatever I wanted for seven minutes.
It was perfect.

368
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:46.560
And two fights earlier,
my brain almost melted down.
When I look back,

369
00:20:46.561 --> 00:20:49.810
I don't know if I lost vision or if I fainted or what,

370
00:20:49.811 --> 00:20:52.930
like just absolute utter failure and it,

371
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.610
and it hurts you because in our genes,
the,

372
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.140
when males would fight,
if one of them would lose,
you'd be kicked out of the,

373
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.590
out of the,
uh,
the group.
Like you may never have sex again.

374
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:10.650
You may never a one loss of a fight with another male could change your history

375
00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:14.230
for the rest of your life.
That's in our genes only x generations ago.

376
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:18.310
And we still feel that.
But failure is really fucking brutal.

377
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.920
But it makes you look at these things differently.

378
00:21:20.921 --> 00:21:24.770
Like now when I look at these elite level fighters who can do that every day,

379
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:25.540
every day,

380
00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.500
I've such a marvel and what they're capable of and I think that's cause I got

381
00:21:29.501 --> 00:21:34.210
brutally embarrassed and fight before you know and I think and you'd sure don't

382
00:21:34.211 --> 00:21:35.100
like that experience but you,

383
00:21:35.101 --> 00:21:37.840
it changes who you are and hopefully in good ways later on.

384
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.270
<v 1>Well it also when you lose and whenever you fail at something and you feel that</v>

385
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.680
awful feeling of failure,

386
00:21:43.681 --> 00:21:48.570
the motivation that comes from that to never feel that again is almost

387
00:21:48.571 --> 00:21:52.680
impossible to recreate without having experienced failure.

388
00:21:52.681 --> 00:21:55.830
You find it in comedy,
I experienced it and fighting as well,

389
00:21:55.831 --> 00:21:58.530
but that those moments where when it's over,

390
00:21:58.531 --> 00:22:03.240
you just feel like such a hunk of shit that like when you're training from then

391
00:22:03.241 --> 00:22:04.230
on you,

392
00:22:04.231 --> 00:22:08.130
your intensity is so much higher because the stakes are higher because you know

393
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.400
that there's a brutal beat down by somebody is such a horrible proposition.

394
00:22:14.071 --> 00:22:17.150
Not just in the moment but after that moment.
The,

395
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:20.850
the thinking about the act of thinking about it the same as failing.
Like,

396
00:22:20.851 --> 00:22:24.750
I think failure as a person and especially as a man,

397
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.120
I think it's a huge part of life.

398
00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:30.240
I think it's an important part of life and it's the people that stay on the

399
00:22:30.241 --> 00:22:31.710
couch and don't risk anything.

400
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:36.540
The Uri that's trying to stay comfortable is one of the worst decisions you

401
00:22:36.541 --> 00:22:40.620
could ever make as a man.
Trying to stay comfortable as a terrible,
terrible path.

402
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:41.070
Yeah,

403
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.720
because you're just going to stay soft and weak and you're never going to figure

404
00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.550
out anything.
He never gonna accomplish shit.

405
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.190
<v 3>I,
I've got to do some pretty fun things.
I have a really good life.</v>

406
00:22:50.191 --> 00:22:54.180
I like everything that I do and a,
I got to kill her wife and I live in Canada.

407
00:22:54.181 --> 00:22:58.980
I have fun and stuff and I really think the only two things that I ever had

408
00:22:58.981 --> 00:23:03.300
going for me was that I have a crazy good work ethic and I'm not afraid to look

409
00:23:03.301 --> 00:23:07.350
like an idiot.
I don't give a fuck.
I am not afraid to look like an idiot.

410
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:12.470
Failure sucks and it hurts you but thee be not afraid to be made fun of or,

411
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.560
or put down or looked at and laughed at and not give a shit about that.

412
00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:21.390
You'll try stuff,
you know,
you'll go for things like you'll do stuff and uh,

413
00:23:21.391 --> 00:23:22.410
I mean,
man,

414
00:23:22.411 --> 00:23:25.950
nobody ever had more haters than a guy who are eye make up and tried to go into

415
00:23:25.951 --> 00:23:30.330
the fight game.
Like,
I mean,
fucking everybody hated me.
Everybody in Canada,

416
00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.740
like anybody in the fight business and here I am fucking six years later,

417
00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.680
all you can do is put your head down and try to do good work.

418
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.360
You can't do anything else.
Nothing.
He can't kiss anybody's ass.

419
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.050
I was talking to Eddie about this too.
You can't kiss anybody's ass.

420
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.070
You can't beg your way out of it.
You can't buy way out of it.
If they hate

421
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.340
<v 4>you and they think you're a joke,
the only answer is to just do,</v>

422
00:23:49.341 --> 00:23:52.610
try to do great work.
There's no other,
there's no other care.
And uh,

423
00:23:52.611 --> 00:23:53.630
that's what I tried to do.

424
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:55.970
<v 1>Yeah.
I think in that sense,</v>

425
00:23:55.971 --> 00:24:00.230
sometimes it's good to have haters because it keeps you motivated,

426
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:05.060
it keeps you motivated.
And it also,
it's,
it's a balancing act,
you know,

427
00:24:05.061 --> 00:24:09.960
I think,
I think the world needs Yin and Yang.
The world needs push and pull.

428
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.430
And I think that having some negativity in your life,

429
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.840
it makes the positivity feels so much better.
Yeah.

430
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.250
<v 4>Yeah.
No,
it makes it,
it makes a lot of sense,
man.
We,
I mean,</v>

431
00:24:19.251 --> 00:24:21.950
we were just talking about losing what,
you know,

432
00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:26.240
if there's is that evolutionary reason and that like deep ns at all.
My God,

433
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:27.650
I am never,
I'm going to be made,

434
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.110
pushed out of the group and never have sex again.

435
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.690
I'm going to wander the earth alone for the rest of my life that's in us.

436
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:36.890
But I think also,
uh,
you know,
I forgot where I was going.

437
00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:40.493
<v 1>He's not even stolen.</v>

438
00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:45.070
<v 4>Yeah,
no,
I had an edible this morning.
Um,
but,
uh,
yeah,</v>

439
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.160
I mean it's just one of those things.
It's a miserable,
miserable thing,

440
00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:53.260
but I know where I was going.
Winning is so good because losing so terrible,

441
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.650
you know,
like,
I mean,
if losing didn't suck,
winning would be,
oh cool,

442
00:24:56.651 --> 00:24:58.210
let's go try and win again next weekend.

443
00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:01.470
<v 1>I remember when I was competing the day of the competition,</v>

444
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.800
there was always moments where I was like,
I gotta stop doing this.
Like,

445
00:25:04.801 --> 00:25:08.160
this is just too much stress.
It just feels terrible.
This is,

446
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.470
and then once I would,
when I would go,

447
00:25:10.471 --> 00:25:13.080
this is the greatest feeling in the world has ever known.

448
00:25:13.081 --> 00:25:17.340
Like people who I feel sorry for people who don't know what this feels like to

449
00:25:17.341 --> 00:25:20.520
just to,
to win like a major taekwondo tournament or something like that.

450
00:25:20.521 --> 00:25:23.850
It was just the craziest feeling.
Like you just felt like,
wow,

451
00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.880
all that work paid off and that fuels you as a person to accomplish other

452
00:25:28.921 --> 00:25:30.090
things.
It gives you this,

453
00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:35.250
this understanding of focus and of motivation and discipline and that if you

454
00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.720
apply all those things to anything,
to writing,
to whatever you trying to do,

455
00:25:39.721 --> 00:25:41.880
to building a business to whatever you're trying to do,

456
00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:45.630
you can accomplish things that you felt were insurmountable before.

457
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.520
<v 4>For sure.
I mean,
uh,
there was,
uh,</v>

458
00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:52.720
the opposite of that too is in us,

459
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.750
I think we all think if the Zombie apocalypse happens tomorrow,

460
00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.140
I'll be the guy rolls the car off,
my wife picks her up,
runs out of here,

461
00:25:59.141 --> 00:26:02.290
kills 10 zombies on the way,
gets on the helicopter and gets out of there.

462
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.450
But that's not entirely always true.

463
00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.060
And you need to find that out about yourself,

464
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:10.060
<v 1>right?
You need to,
yeah.
You need to face the fire.</v>

465
00:26:10.061 --> 00:26:13.270
Don't understand what it's like to be under extreme pressure.

466
00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:17.780
<v 4>Yeah.
And uh,
and losing makes you say,</v>

467
00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:21.680
I'm not necessarily that guy who fucking flips the car.
Does that jumps,

468
00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:25.280
kills 10 zombies.
But then if you can come back and when you go,
you know what,

469
00:26:25.281 --> 00:26:27.230
if I'm at my best,
if I'm focused,
if I have,

470
00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:30.470
I have my shit together some of the time I can be that guy.

471
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:32.690
And I think that's what you kind of hope for.

472
00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:33.271
<v 1>Well,</v>

473
00:26:33.271 --> 00:26:38.271
it's also objective analysis of your own shortcomings and your own strengths.

474
00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:43.440
And that comes in martial arts.
It's a huge factor in martial arts because when,

475
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.820
especially when you're training,
when you're in the gym and you're sparring with,

476
00:26:47.821 --> 00:26:49.200
you know,
if you got a great gem,

477
00:26:49.201 --> 00:26:51.720
like you're training a 10th planet Jiu Jitsu or something like that,

478
00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:56.640
you got just a whole room full of killers and everyone kind of knows the food

479
00:26:56.641 --> 00:26:57.474
chain.

480
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.450
Everyone knows where everybody stands and why does everyone know where everybody

481
00:27:00.451 --> 00:27:00.751
stands?

482
00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:03.150
We know where everybody stands because we're tapping each other out on a regular

483
00:27:03.151 --> 00:27:07.800
basis.
And so because of that you're forced to really analyze your game.

484
00:27:07.801 --> 00:27:10.240
Like this motherfucker gets me in his guard,
I'm in trouble.

485
00:27:10.241 --> 00:27:14.040
Like I got a status guys,
guard,
I know this.
Why?
Because I've been caught.

486
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:18.080
I understand it.
Whereas if you don't have any experience overcoming adversity,

487
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:19.410
like nobody's catching me.

488
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.650
And then you get in there with somebody who just rag dolls you and you like what

489
00:27:22.651 --> 00:27:27.330
the fuck?
And like your ideas of who you are a change because you,

490
00:27:27.331 --> 00:27:28.410
you have this distorted.

491
00:27:28.411 --> 00:27:31.380
But like how many guys out there that have never fought have this crazy

492
00:27:31.381 --> 00:27:33.580
distorted perception of what they're capable,

493
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.890
<v 4>insane.
Like nobody looks at Tiger Woods and goes on the right damn that guy,</v>

494
00:27:37.891 --> 00:27:42.720
1818 holes.
You don't know how I play golf.
I played golf.

495
00:27:42.721 --> 00:27:46.020
I would dominate because I'm taking it to the street and it's going to be

496
00:27:46.021 --> 00:27:49.200
fucking street golf.
You know like guys really think that,

497
00:27:49.201 --> 00:27:52.920
but that's a lack of understanding of what that really is.

498
00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:56.190
I mean you can kind of see it that the willingness or the ability to go,

499
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.310
there's trouble,
I'm going to hit it with this fist that's in every guy.

500
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:03.240
So they don't understand that other guys have an understanding of physics and

501
00:28:03.241 --> 00:28:04.770
understanding of where the body works.

502
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.660
What happens when you hit somebody in the throat?

503
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.260
What that the natural instinct to roll away gives them your back.

504
00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:13.080
Like all the most basics.
They don't even understand that exists.
Right?

505
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.660
So they have the idea that if I hit that thing with this thing,

506
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:17.280
I might be able to beat it.

507
00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.330
<v 1>That somehow or another they're tougher.
Somehow they're more alpha,</v>

508
00:28:22.331 --> 00:28:27.200
other whatever,
whatever goofy shit they have in their head.
And it's just a prop.

509
00:28:27.201 --> 00:28:30.500
It's like,
it's like a building that they use for a movie,

510
00:28:30.501 --> 00:28:31.970
but there's nothing inside the house.

511
00:28:31.971 --> 00:28:36.110
Like you have this like this fake facade and then behind there there's no house.

512
00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.660
Where's your fucking house?
Ah,
you know,

513
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.900
and some fucking beast mounts you and start to pound that on you and you give

514
00:28:41.901 --> 00:28:44.150
your back and you're like,
and then after that's over,

515
00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.110
you're so devastated and defeated and who you,

516
00:28:48.111 --> 00:28:51.050
your perceptions of who you are.
We're so screwy.
Yeah.

517
00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.620
I can't tell you how many times I've had guys tell me that they would never lose

518
00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:58.490
if they fought because my mentality,
they're always like this job,
bro.

519
00:28:58.491 --> 00:28:59.840
I don't move my mentality.

520
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.780
<v 4>That's,
I've had a dozen.
Why do they all have a tie in accent?</v>

521
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:09.190
<v 1>They're all Italian.
It's a huge part of my,
uh,
my culture.
The Italians,</v>

522
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:11.530
I don't know what it is about my people,

523
00:29:11.531 --> 00:29:13.270
but they're goofy as fuck when it comes to that.

524
00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.750
They have this bizarre belief in their ability to fight.

525
00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.980
<v 4>That's awesome.
I don't know what it is.
It's that long.
Most of the time,
you know,</v>

526
00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:25.820
even if it's wrong,
like you see dudes do terrible things,
treat people bad,

527
00:29:25.821 --> 00:29:29.600
knee assholes.
If that guy took a beating when he was 15 he'd be a better person.

528
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:33.470
You're right.
He will be a way better guide today.
He would treat people better,

529
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:36.120
he'd under it,
but you know,
there's not enough of that going on.

530
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.490
We're really soft.

531
00:29:37.491 --> 00:29:42.130
Like our culture is really so like buy a fight network where I work,

532
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:46.030
<v 3>there's like a metro where though you get groceries and then we used to walk</v>

533
00:29:46.031 --> 00:29:47.110
around this building,

534
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.920
it takes like four minutes and they built this path on the other side so it only

535
00:29:50.921 --> 00:29:54.560
takes two minutes now costs like 80 a hundred thousand to strip it out,

536
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.940
put the stuff down and put,
what the fuck are we doing that for?

537
00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.400
When you're in Canada,
that will part of Canada,
Toronto,

538
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.710
it's cold as fuck for about two minutes.

539
00:30:02.711 --> 00:30:06.100
I mean it's like we're going to literally spend money to make sure that people

540
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:10.390
don't have to go do more effort for two minutes.
Even escalators,
like,

541
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:12.490
why don't we make this shit like,
you know what I mean?

542
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.800
We in the history of humankind,

543
00:30:14.801 --> 00:30:18.040
there has never been a softer culture than North America,
Canada.

544
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.610
You got never in human history.
You know,
and that's,

545
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:26.611
I think another reason why fighting is so interesting because in a world like

546
00:30:27.251 --> 00:30:30.280
that,
let's go see what happens when we see the opposite of that.

547
00:30:30.281 --> 00:30:32.770
When we see people who drive it to the hardest level,

548
00:30:32.771 --> 00:30:36.160
push it as far as it can humanly go and go in and gets another guy.

549
00:30:36.161 --> 00:30:38.680
You're talking about a guy saying,
oh,
you know,
I'm hard.

550
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:40.990
That guy's fucking hard to,
right.

551
00:30:40.991 --> 00:30:45.500
The guy you're fighting is also mentally unbelievably talented.
He's also,

552
00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:46.900
and he's better than you.

553
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.330
<v 1>Yeah.
And he's training every day,
check active,</v>

554
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:53.730
and he's got a real balanced sense of who he is.
He's a real martial artist.
Yeah.

555
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.380
Yeah.
That,
that's a good point.

556
00:30:55.381 --> 00:30:59.280
That how soft we are is one of the reasons why it's so exciting to see someone

557
00:30:59.281 --> 00:31:03.420
compete in such a,
it's such a dangerous and volatile profession,

558
00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.330
but the critics of MMA would say,
well,

559
00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:11.450
the reason why we are so quote unquote soft is that our race or the human race

560
00:31:12.091 --> 00:31:16.920
is evolving and that we are moving towards a state where we no longer require

561
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:18.180
physical conflict.

562
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:23.250
I think that martial arts is the key to that gap in the deal,
and this is,

563
00:31:23.251 --> 00:31:27.930
it would seem like contradictory to someone who doesn't engage in martial arts,

564
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:31.260
but I think that the realities of the biology,

565
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:35.070
the realities of the body itself and the long history of combat,

566
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.990
that it's ingrained in our genetics.

567
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:42.350
Our DNA has this long history of all these people before us that had to fight to

568
00:31:43.081 --> 00:31:43.741
stay alive,

569
00:31:43.741 --> 00:31:47.220
whether it's to fight off animals or fight off intruders or photo and this.

570
00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:51.510
All this conflict is almost built into the system.
And one of the best ways,

571
00:31:51.511 --> 00:31:52.291
in my opinion,

572
00:31:52.291 --> 00:31:57.291
to ensure peace is to actually exercise out all of that conflict in the gym so

573
00:31:58.591 --> 00:32:00.810
that it doesn't exist in society.

574
00:32:00.811 --> 00:32:04.560
It doesn't exist in the workplace and it doesn't exist in friendships and it

575
00:32:04.561 --> 00:32:07.860
doesn't exist in,
in,
you know,
in the,
the world at large,

576
00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:11.370
it only exists in doe Joe's.
It only exists in gyms.

577
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.470
And some of the nicest,

578
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:17.790
most respectful people I have ever met have been killers,

579
00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:22.090
murderers,
I mean in the gym,
you know,
in,
in the,
in the cage,
in,
in,

580
00:32:22.091 --> 00:32:26.640
in boxing rings.
Kickboxers the nicest folks because of the fact that they,

581
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.120
they have no insecurities when it comes to that stuff.
They,
their co,

582
00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:34.080
their focus when it comes to their martial arts is not about,
you know,

583
00:32:34.081 --> 00:32:39.000
like it's not about going out and bullying people on the street or going out

584
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:39.861
picking fights.
No,

585
00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:44.660
their focus is in bettering their skills and in doing so and in training really

586
00:32:44.661 --> 00:32:48.560
hard,
all your need to prove all that goes away.

587
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:53.030
Like some I've seen like MMA fighters that people don't know and they get into

588
00:32:53.031 --> 00:32:55.340
discussions with people when someone will get douchey with them and they'll

589
00:32:55.341 --> 00:32:57.980
smile and laugh.
Like there's a famous story,

590
00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.710
my friend Tate Fletcher fought on the ultimate fighter.

591
00:33:00.711 --> 00:33:04.850
He's a black belt in Jujitsu is a bad motherfucker.
It's cool ass dude too.

592
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:08.630
Super Nice.
If you're a friendly guy,
Tate's going to be your best friend.

593
00:33:08.631 --> 00:33:09.830
He's just the nicest guy ever.

594
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:14.360
But we were in the hard rock hotel and there was this big fucking kid,
man.

595
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:19.280
He was like six foot six,
maybe at least six,
four,
six,
five and Tate's like six,

596
00:33:19.281 --> 00:33:23.210
four.
So this guy was bigger than tape and uh,
like probably like a big,

597
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.220
he's probably like college age 23,
24.

598
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:33.380
And he was just being a fucking trunk asshole to everybody and just walking

599
00:33:33.381 --> 00:33:35.540
around with his shirt off this big giant kid.

600
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:39.530
And he got to Tate's door and he said to Tate like,
hey man,

601
00:33:39.531 --> 00:33:43.760
that's my fucking room.
And a Tate's like,
no,
I'm pretty sure it's my room.

602
00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:44.211
He's like,

603
00:33:44.211 --> 00:33:48.260
I got my key right here and I'm gonna use the key and a cake take goes,

604
00:33:48.261 --> 00:33:51.290
take it easy.
And t Tate opens his door and goes inside.

605
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.070
And I had the room next to Tate.
So I go inside my room and I hear bang,
Bang,

606
00:33:55.071 --> 00:33:59.980
Bang.
I hear banging on tates door and we had our doors open.
You know,
we uh,
yeah,

607
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.010
the adjoining rooms and I stepped through tastes target.

608
00:34:03.011 --> 00:34:06.440
What the fuck's going on?
Is that,
that same guy.
And so Tate opens a guy,
he goes,

609
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:08.270
don't you shut the door on me bitch?

610
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:12.830
Like it was like some crazy moment where this guy was like,

611
00:34:12.831 --> 00:34:16.280
not just picking a fight,
but going after Tate.
Once he went into the room,

612
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.480
they go out to the hallway and people do that.
And it's just so big.
Bullying,

613
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:25.230
just a big bully who'd used to be,
you know,
used to being a big bully.
And,
um,

614
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:28.520
take goes,
uh,
what do you,
you know,
what do you want to do man?

615
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:31.220
What do you want to do?
He goes,
he goes,
I'm gonna kick your fucking ass.

616
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.130
Let's take those.
Once you come over here and swing on me,
man,
come on,
come on.

617
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:37.060
So a Tate is standing in front of the dude and the dude's to,

618
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.170
and the dude is like,
oh shit,
this is really happening.

619
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:43.970
And then Tate throws an inside leg kick and then pulls,

620
00:34:43.971 --> 00:34:48.971
guard grabs the guy pulls guard before the guy even knows it,

621
00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:54.220
Tate hooks and Alma Plata is on the side of the guy and then security shows up.

622
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.700
So he's got this guy in normal plot that he's got his arm under his neck and the

623
00:34:58.701 --> 00:35:03.110
normal Plata and security shows up and they go,
stop,
stop,
stop.
So I go,

624
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:06.680
don't worry about it man.
I go,
it's fine.
He's just going to put them to sleep.

625
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.170
It's okay.
And the and the security guy goes,
hey,

626
00:35:09.171 --> 00:35:11.960
you're that guy from fear factor.
And in that moment,

627
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:15.620
in that moment with the security guys are completely going,
Holy Shit,

628
00:35:15.621 --> 00:35:19.030
what are you doing here man?
I go,
this drunk guys picking on my friend.
And when,

629
00:35:19.031 --> 00:35:21.650
when I said like,
don't worry,
he's just going to put them to sleep.

630
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:24.050
Tate said that in his head.
He was like,
all right,

631
00:35:24.051 --> 00:35:27.350
I guess I wouldn't put them asleep now.
He wasn't going to hit the guy.

632
00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:29.000
He just decided like,
look,

633
00:35:29.001 --> 00:35:32.720
if I hit this guy and then it becomes crazy salt and there's marks on him.

634
00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.700
So Tate just chokes it,
puts a rear naked,

635
00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:37.380
choke on him and sleep some right there in the hallway.

636
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.290
His friends picked the guy up and it's like a scene in that goddamn movie.

637
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:44.070
His friends picked the guy up,
they put him in the hotel,
the elevator,

638
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.810
the elevator door closes and the guy at vanishes and he disappears from line.

639
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:53.520
That is labs all night.
We for years,
we still bring this up.

640
00:35:53.521 --> 00:35:57.420
This shit happened to like 2003 we still bring this up because it was so

641
00:35:57.421 --> 00:35:58.170
ridiculous.

642
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:00.020
<v 4>Uh,
you've seen Ryan,
what's his name?</v>

643
00:36:00.021 --> 00:36:04.320
That Ju Jitsu guy in a bar and he takes the guy down.

644
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:05.440
Takes his bat or a mountain.

645
00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:10.000
<v 1>Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Tom Hall,
right?
Yeah.</v>

646
00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:14.620
<v 4>Don't worry about it.
Gets him down mount some waits till he's exhausted.</v>

647
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:17.570
<v 1>Yeah.
Well he's used to doing that all the time.</v>

648
00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:21.540
That's the thing about training is like you're used to struggling like

649
00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.460
essentially for your life.
What does it tap?

650
00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:30.410
Tap is a way that you can train where it's safe and someone taps and what that

651
00:36:30.411 --> 00:36:32.280
means is,
you know you got me,
but what?

652
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:34.430
What has got me means it means you're dead.

653
00:36:34.431 --> 00:36:37.480
I would have died or my arm would have broken in half and then he killed.

654
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:38.573
Then you kill them.

655
00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:43.100
It's essentially you're playing a game called I kill you with my body or you

656
00:36:43.101 --> 00:36:47.150
kill me or we kill each other several times over the course of a seven minute

657
00:36:47.151 --> 00:36:50.570
rolling session and then we shake hands.
Thanks man,
that was great.

658
00:36:50.571 --> 00:36:52.830
And then you move on to the next day.
I walked out of there.

659
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:57.180
<v 4>Well it'd be a better person and I agree 100% it exercises that stuff out of</v>

660
00:36:57.181 --> 00:37:01.530
your system.
That's the frustrating thing when all of a sudden,
you know,

661
00:37:01.531 --> 00:37:04.560
I come to town and my wife's here and her friends are like,

662
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:07.050
what's the deal with this war machine?
And Christy Mack,

663
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:08.700
they don't know about any of this stuff.

664
00:37:08.701 --> 00:37:12.300
They don't know about in any of the good things about,
about martial arts.

665
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.130
They don't know about any of the good things it does.

666
00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.950
It makes people a better person.
They just come in and they're like,
hey,

667
00:37:16.951 --> 00:37:20.130
some submit MMA fighter beat up a porn star.
Like,
you know what I mean?

668
00:37:20.131 --> 00:37:20.964
They don't know.

669
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:25.010
Like they don't know that there's that side to it that Marshall had to make sure

670
00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:29.860
<v 1>better fucked up story.
I don't,
you know,
I don't know what exactly went down.</v>

671
00:37:29.861 --> 00:37:31.510
Like people keep asking me to comment on it.

672
00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:37.020
This is the only thing I would ever say any anytime,
you know,

673
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:40.540
there's an altercation like that between a man and a woman and a man hits a

674
00:37:40.541 --> 00:37:45.400
woman,
it's,
it's never correct.
It's always evil.

675
00:37:45.401 --> 00:37:46.270
It's always wrong.

676
00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:51.700
It's beyond fucked that a guy could beat a woman.
It's beyond fuck.

677
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:56.500
And it should be,
it should be a heinous crime that's punishable in,

678
00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:00.790
in the worst ways possible.
But I don't know what happened.
You know,

679
00:38:00.791 --> 00:38:05.710
all I know is it appears according to her story that he beat the shit out of
her.

680
00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:10.330
That's what it looks like.
There's no evidence to the contrary.
And that's awful.

681
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:14.980
So that's all I could say.
I mean,
I'm not commenting on it until,

682
00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.570
I mean really commenting on until I know more of what exactly happened.

683
00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:23.590
I don't know what the fuck went down,
but I don't know how it got,
could do that.

684
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:28.280
I literally do not know how a man,
especially a martial artist,

685
00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.780
he always likes to think of yourself as not a martial artist.
He's a fighter,

686
00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:32.300
you know?

687
00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:36.190
<v 4>Yeah.
And that's probably true.
He's an animal,
you know.
And there are</v>

688
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.900
<v 3>those guys typically in the gym,</v>

689
00:38:37.901 --> 00:38:40.240
you don't get guys get that good that are animals like that.

690
00:38:40.241 --> 00:38:43.570
They don't have enough,
they have too much ego to go,
I'm not good at this,

691
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:46.960
so I have to train that to get better.
So you don't,
these guys come into,

692
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.960
you know,
a big gym and they're new and they're tough guys.

693
00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:53.500
They're gone in a year.
They don't have,
they won't have the,

694
00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:56.140
the absence of ego enough to train and things are not good at.

695
00:38:56.141 --> 00:38:57.160
And then they ended up leaving.

696
00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:02.170
So it's rare that somebody has to be very driven of like a,
you know,
a,

697
00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:05.230
an animal style fighter typed,

698
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:09.400
get past that to get to that level or just be genetically really superior,

699
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:13.570
you know,
or whatever.
It's rare that that style of person becomes a high level.

700
00:39:13.571 --> 00:39:13.890
I'm a

701
00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:17.440
<v 1>fun.
Yeah,
it is.
It is rare because if you're that fucked in the head,</v>

702
00:39:17.441 --> 00:39:21.340
usually not strong enough mentally to keep going and to get to that salmon war

703
00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:25.630
machines.
Uh,
he's a high level MMA fighter.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean it's,

704
00:39:25.631 --> 00:39:30.190
it's just so disappointing.
I had them in the podcast was six months ago maybe.

705
00:39:30.191 --> 00:39:33.760
Something like that.
Yeah.
It's a weird,
unbelievably sad that like you said,

706
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:36.970
we don't really know.
Life's over.
Yeah.
I'll fucking,
life is over.
I mean,

707
00:39:36.971 --> 00:39:40.270
I dunno what he's going to do because he's been in jail twice now and this is

708
00:39:40.271 --> 00:39:44.290
the third one and a girl.
Yeah,
a pretty little girl like that.

709
00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:46.720
She's tiny man.
A hundred pounds.
Yeah.

710
00:39:46.721 --> 00:39:48.450
You don't like to speculate on how the salon,

711
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:51.560
<v 3>let's change subject.
It's distance.
It's a weird one too.
You know,</v>

712
00:39:51.561 --> 00:39:55.940
not just this topic,
but it's strange.
Like I like to analyze fighting.

713
00:39:55.970 --> 00:40:00.970
I don't really like to be an MMA journalist because a lot of that time you're

714
00:40:02.031 --> 00:40:03.200
not talking about fighting,

715
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:07.670
guys are talking about this guy said that thing or this sold that many things

716
00:40:07.671 --> 00:40:09.890
are,
you know,
why is this guy not a star?

717
00:40:09.891 --> 00:40:11.870
I don't care really about that shit so much.

718
00:40:11.871 --> 00:40:16.820
Like to me I'm just just so unbelievably curious of what is going to happen when

719
00:40:16.821 --> 00:40:18.350
Demetrius Johnson fights this guy.

720
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:21.980
And then after he fights sat guy sitting there and trying to figure out what the

721
00:40:21.981 --> 00:40:25.940
thing was that made that one moment like you know Jaron Vol?
Yes.

722
00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:29.360
Yeah Jaron vol was,
was a reffing that match.

723
00:40:29.361 --> 00:40:32.000
We talk about bad ras who talking about bad judges.
We,

724
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:35.600
Jaron is cool and I ran into him in Winnipeg actually Joe Dirksen was at this

725
00:40:35.601 --> 00:40:38.630
party and you were talking about the guys that Kinda,
you know,

726
00:40:38.631 --> 00:40:42.500
our cool Dirksen works now in a prison and he said,
God,
she'll be like,

727
00:40:42.501 --> 00:40:45.020
I think I can beat you.
And he'll be like,
yeah,
you probably could.
My,

728
00:40:45.021 --> 00:40:48.520
Joe doesn't give a shit,
but,
uh,
they're Jaron Vilas there.
And he was saying,

729
00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.900
I really like your Demetrius Johnson breakdown.
I'm like,
thanks man.

730
00:40:50.901 --> 00:40:54.520
Whenever anybody's like likes those,
it means a lot to me cause I,

731
00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.800
I'd love doing them.
Right.
And so we're talking about,
he goes,
well,
you know,

732
00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:02.140
tell me what else you saw and where I'm having a beer and I whatever.
And uh,

733
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:05.330
I said,
why?
And he goes,
well,
I was,
I was wrapping that one.
So I did.

734
00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:08.810
I looked at a lot of tape to,
and I'm like,
really?
That's cool man.
He goes,
yeah,

735
00:41:08.811 --> 00:41:10.730
me and big John,
him and John are very good friends.

736
00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.440
They'll go on Skype and look at tape together.
And so I'm like,
wow,

737
00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:16.700
that's fucking cool that you do that.
And he goes,
yeah,
I saw a couple of things.

738
00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.100
How one thing you didn't,
he didn't say you missed,

739
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.860
but he suggested and it was fucking brilliant.

740
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:26.240
Like this referee that was wrapping the main event picked up on this one.

741
00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.400
That basically when the two guys,

742
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:32.330
when when Demetrius Johnson ends up kind of in that center zone,

743
00:41:32.331 --> 00:41:36.440
not quite the clinch and not quite at,
at uh,
you know,
in the pocket,

744
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:38.880
kind of in that middle zone,
he'll give you a little bit shop.

745
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:41.470
Like he'll come see,
yeah,
well he,

746
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:44.870
he is looking for one of your only two logical responses.

747
00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.590
You're going to back up and he backs all the way out or you're going to push

748
00:41:48.591 --> 00:41:50.240
against his,
and he goes to the clinch.

749
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:54.830
So he goes in as a little sample test and he does it all after Jaron pointed
out,

750
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:57.110
I'm like,
holy fuck.
I looked at his fights.
He always does that.

751
00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:01.460
And for a co a referee to go and spend that much time and find that little

752
00:42:01.461 --> 00:42:03.770
moment because,
and I said,
why did you do that?
Because,
well,

753
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:07.070
I just wanted to be in the right moment and right places and be aware of what

754
00:42:07.071 --> 00:42:10.760
was going on.
I'm like,
that's a fucking good.
That's uh,
that's what we need.

755
00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.040
<v 0>Yeah.
That is what we need.</v>

756
00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:16.600
And get an actual example in Demetrius Johnson of a guy who's trained by one of

757
00:42:16.601 --> 00:42:18.180
the best in the world.
And Matt Hume.

758
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.500
<v 3>I did a breakdown a Matt Hume's first fight in Pancrase.</v>

759
00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:25.590
<v 0>Oh yeah.
I'm a big man.
Whom Fan?
I really like him in the corner too.
Yeah,</v>

760
00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.890
he's great at giving look technical instructions in between rounds.

761
00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:33.990
I think you know there's a few guys that are just really good trainers and you

762
00:42:33.991 --> 00:42:36.530
just see it in the,
in the examples of the fight.

763
00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.090
Duane Ludwig I think right now is the best.

764
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.610
I don't think there's a better striking coach on earth.

765
00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.530
<v 3>Duke at Duke has him.
He's right up there with them.
Right up there with them.</v>

766
00:42:45.531 --> 00:42:50.400
You can,
Henri Hooft are in this world of perfection and bang,

767
00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:52.170
Ludwig is pushing the boundaries a little.

768
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:53.970
He's trying to task is taking new things.

769
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.230
Even just the simplest shit that he was showing me,
uh,
after,
uh,

770
00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:01.320
was it after or before Tj fight?
I think it was before.

771
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:06.650
And he was showing me the elements of when guys will go to enter and you know

772
00:43:06.691 --> 00:43:09.600
how like I'll use punches to get you to think up and down and you start

773
00:43:09.601 --> 00:43:10.434
responding up and down.

774
00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:15.770
He makes you believe that he is playing with your up and down and while your

775
00:43:16.171 --> 00:43:19.860
brain is focusing in on that,
he camouflages his footwork in.

776
00:43:19.861 --> 00:43:24.810
So some of the punches are bullshit to make you think about them while he steps

777
00:43:24.811 --> 00:43:27.960
off in a different place.
Yeah.
Shit like that.
Like and it's,

778
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:33.080
and he's a man and he is operating like he's got 700 cups of coffee and he's

779
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:38.340
yelling at his thinking fast and you can see,
talk about flow when he's teaching.

780
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:40.260
This guy's in a different place.

781
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.670
<v 0>Yeah,
he really is.
Yeah.
Duane Ludwig,
chugs Alpha brain.</v>

782
00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:47.690
That shit like candy.
He eats it all day long.
He's obsessed with,

783
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:51.500
he's obsessed with analyzing fights and training fighters.

784
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:56.660
It's such a huge part of his daily thought process.
It's it,
it,

785
00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.570
it just,
it's engrossing.
It just is.

786
00:43:59.571 --> 00:44:03.080
It's his whole being and that's why he's so God damn good.

787
00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:08.320
I sat down with him at lunch the day TJ fought Barao and when Tj Dillashaw beat

788
00:44:08.661 --> 00:44:09.231
Hanan Barao,

789
00:44:09.231 --> 00:44:12.740
who at the time was thought of as the best pound for pound fighter or one of the

790
00:44:12.741 --> 00:44:15.260
best pound for pound for pound fighters in the world.

791
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:19.940
Tj was a big underdog and Tj went into that fight and dominated Hennen Browne

792
00:44:19.941 --> 00:44:23.150
knocked him out in the fifth round after dropping them the first dominating them

793
00:44:23.151 --> 00:44:24.560
for five rounds and then stopped him.

794
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.770
But what was crazy was when I had lunch with Dwayne,

795
00:44:27.771 --> 00:44:32.040
Dwayne told me exactly what the plan was and then he went out and

796
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.340
<v 5>did it exactly that way.
A lot of switching stances,</v>

797
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:39.060
a lot of capitalizing on Barao loading up and standing flat footed,

798
00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.860
a lot of stepping to the outside.

799
00:44:40.861 --> 00:44:43.860
Then immediately countering and he did it over and over and over again.

800
00:44:43.861 --> 00:44:47.880
And TJ is a sponge man.
I had a chance to watch those to workout together.

801
00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:52.710
Tj is just a sponge.
He's a sponge.
Everything Duane teaches them.
Yeah.

802
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:54.120
Sometimes it's like,

803
00:44:54.121 --> 00:44:56.940
do you got the brilliant teacher and the brilliant fighter and then the two

804
00:44:56.941 --> 00:45:00.540
together make an even bigger thing.
And there's no conflict between those guys.

805
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.250
They're really good friends and Tj is a completely open book.
He,

806
00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:09.260
his cup is empty and Dwayne is completely ego free when it comes to teaching

807
00:45:09.631 --> 00:45:11.550
him.
He's all about getting TJ better.

808
00:45:11.551 --> 00:45:13.710
Tj is all about getting better and they're great friends.

809
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:14.670
These guys love each other.

810
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:17.610
So they're always laughing and joking and palled around together.

811
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:21.720
Like when Tj beat Hanan Barao and there was this moment after the fight where

812
00:45:21.721 --> 00:45:25.770
they hugged and they're both crying Israel.
Woo fucking real man.

813
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.430
I was tearing up when I was watching it,
a cage side.
It was crazy.
Amazing.
Yeah,

814
00:45:29.431 --> 00:45:34.320
it was incredible.
I really wise and Demetrius and Matt Hume,
similar thing.

815
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:39.180
I look back,
it was 1994,
it was like four months after UFC one.

816
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:42.690
And I and I went back and reanalyze cause we,
uh,
up at fight network,

817
00:45:42.691 --> 00:45:44.280
we're calling classic pancreas.

818
00:45:44.281 --> 00:45:47.400
So we got all of the old pancreas and were commentating them through the lens of

819
00:45:47.401 --> 00:45:50.580
today.
So we're going,
you know,
this guy does this.
Wow.
You know,

820
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:53.880
in 2014 that couldn't happen because of this,
this and this.

821
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:58.680
So we're looking at them historically in the context of today.
It's super cool,

822
00:45:58.681 --> 00:46:01.860
man.
It's the funnest thing.
Like guys don't,

823
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:06.060
there's no such thing as a,
like if I,
if I got lots of pasture guard,

824
00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:09.960
he just passes it.
Like in the 90s,
everyone's good at foot locks.

825
00:46:09.961 --> 00:46:12.050
For some reason people change,

826
00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:16.530
you get them out and you'll like swing your leg over the top to go back to side.

827
00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:20.040
So I'm in the map,
my leg over to end up aside,
you'll be an eight,

828
00:46:20.041 --> 00:46:21.960
10 different positions.
Always kind of,

829
00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:25.560
there were chaining together a submission attempts in positions to try to make

830
00:46:25.561 --> 00:46:29.580
you keep guessing,
but it didn't like it had over straight.
It's welcome.

831
00:46:29.581 --> 00:46:32.010
You're looking at it and going,
this doesn't work,
but they're still doing it.

832
00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:36.960
Yeah,
well no,
it's fascinating.
Dog Shit.
Jujitsu.
I watched,
uh,

833
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:41.030
I watched coliseum 2000 with Hixon Gracie,
uh,

834
00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:43.140
over his house like way back.

835
00:46:43.141 --> 00:46:47.760
And I kind of say it was probably like 2004 or 2005 or something like that.

836
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.740
It was back when Hickson was still thinking about fighting.

837
00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:53.670
And it was a few years after he had fought food knocky and coliseum and he's,

838
00:46:53.671 --> 00:46:54.990
we're watching fights together.

839
00:46:54.991 --> 00:46:59.070
We watched the entire event and Hixon would break down the movements and he's

840
00:46:59.071 --> 00:47:03.100
like,
look at all these space,
all this,
you can have this space,
you know,

841
00:47:03.101 --> 00:47:07.050
like this like space to him it's just evil.
Like what is this?
You know,

842
00:47:07.051 --> 00:47:10.680
cause Hickson's Jujitsu has always been the elite of the elite.

843
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:15.330
So when he watches like these errors and these things like big goofy movements,

844
00:47:15.331 --> 00:47:19.500
you know,
with big openings,
he would just drive him crazy.

845
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:23.250
Like he would just be talking about all these errors and what's wrong with this

846
00:47:23.251 --> 00:47:24.840
and so focused on it.

847
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:30.050
And if you watch Jujitsu or you watch MMA from 93 and then watch

848
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:34.270
<v 3>like say Demetrius Johnson in 2014 you're like,
boy,</v>

849
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.660
this is like no sport has evolved as quickly.
Never.

850
00:47:37.661 --> 00:47:41.920
And you those two examples.
It's when I looked at Matt Hume,

851
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:43.870
he was better than everybody him and have Ventana.

852
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:48.070
We're better than everybody just because they were fighting like today.

853
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:52.360
And you look back and Matt Hume was doing this kind of leg ride and side ride,

854
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:57.070
like resting position that at that Chris Weidman was teaching at a seminar I was

855
00:47:57.071 --> 00:48:02.020
at like two years ago and he's doing it in 1994 good morning ty to mad,
humid.

856
00:48:02.021 --> 00:48:02.930
Very good morning time.

857
00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:07.120
Remember he fought pat Miletich and broke his nose and they stopped the fight.

858
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:10.300
That was crazy.
Like stopped the fight for a broken nose.
I know,

859
00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:13.000
I remember like thinking like what kind of Goofy Shit is that?

860
00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:16.600
You look back at these pancreas ones too and it's like there were rope escapes.

861
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:21.520
Like if you go and it's like you've got it,
I'm fucking top.
Instead of tapping,

862
00:48:21.521 --> 00:48:26.380
I grabbed the rope and then were stood up and it's like if it is not finished

863
00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:29.150
you win.
Cause I grabbed the rope once but we've tried to figure that out.

864
00:48:29.151 --> 00:48:31.900
I was going to talk to Dave Meltzer,
right,
who I don't really know good.

865
00:48:31.901 --> 00:48:35.530
But you know we've chatted online and stuff cause he understands that history

866
00:48:35.531 --> 00:48:39.460
moment because there's also a lot of works back then like legitimately and you

867
00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:41.260
when you see works for folks who don't know,

868
00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.710
we're talking about what mean fixed fights and that's a lot of,

869
00:48:44.711 --> 00:48:47.020
that has a history because of pro wrestling.

870
00:48:47.021 --> 00:48:50.710
Pro Wrestling in Japan was huge and that's also where the rope escape came from.

871
00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:52.840
There was always like a big thing in pro wrestling.

872
00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.870
The guy would have a hold on a god that God would grab the rope and the referee

873
00:48:55.871 --> 00:48:59.230
would make them break.
It was a way to keep pro-wrestling.
Interesting.

874
00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:01.090
Well when we look back at it,

875
00:49:01.091 --> 00:49:05.060
we suddenly Ram Deena and I are colonies and we look at each other.
That's,

876
00:49:05.061 --> 00:49:08.170
that's fake.
And some,
the first time that happened we were like,

877
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:11.510
well like I mean we have to address that week.

878
00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:15.070
Like your credibility demands that you don't go,
oh and he power bombed them.

879
00:49:15.071 --> 00:49:17.770
I mean you can't do that yet.
And you're talking about history.

880
00:49:17.771 --> 00:49:21.760
We're trying to make this series a history lesson as well.
Right?

881
00:49:21.761 --> 00:49:25.910
So you have to talk about it.
So they,
the reason it looks,
the way it looks,
you,

882
00:49:25.911 --> 00:49:29.830
you,
you nailed it.
It's like basically wrestling was fake.
Once upon a time.

883
00:49:29.831 --> 00:49:30.491
Wrestling was real,

884
00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:33.820
guys went to towns and they wrestled each other and the winner was the winner

885
00:49:33.821 --> 00:49:34.570
who could wrestle.

886
00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.840
But what's the guy's got so good and it got so boring that they had to fix them

887
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.180
and became progressive.
Is that why they did it?

888
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:43.570
Because God's got so good or is it just because people wanted to control the

889
00:49:43.571 --> 00:49:47.620
outcome?
I think a bit of both because it's more gambling than anything.
Maybe so.

890
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:51.610
Maybe so.
Yeah.
Uh,
and then progressing over there,

891
00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.360
these two guys for knocky and Suzuki went and said,
well,

892
00:49:55.361 --> 00:49:56.440
you're going to take pro wrestling,

893
00:49:56.441 --> 00:49:58.360
which we love and everyone loves and we're going to make it real.

894
00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.180
And so when they made it real,
that was Pancrase.

895
00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:03.070
So suddenly it's like wrestling was real,

896
00:50:03.071 --> 00:50:05.140
then it was fake and now we're going to make it real again.

897
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:09.100
So there were things like rope escapes left in there as you trans,

898
00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:13.310
as you transferred from fake to real again.
They stayed there for a bit.
Yeah,

899
00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.460
that's interesting.
That's really interesting.

900
00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:18.760
And they were so obsessed with the storylines because they were originally

901
00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:23.140
rustling performers that the most of the work's involved them and involve them

902
00:50:23.141 --> 00:50:27.160
losing.
So in its in its own way,
it was only there to create,

903
00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:32.060
but it's a weird time in there like for purists and I fucking love the sport.

904
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:36.740
You have to make sense of why that was for people so that they're not just,

905
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:41.120
it doesn't color MMA in a way,
but it was that moment where I'm a man.

906
00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:43.310
Wrestling sort of touched each other in the early nineties

907
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:45.770
<v 0>yeah,
that is an interesting thing,
man.</v>

908
00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:49.430
It's also an interesting thing that I,

909
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:52.670
we were saying this that I don't think there's ever been a sport that has

910
00:50:52.671 --> 00:50:57.620
changed so much and grown so much in just a period of 20 years.

911
00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:03.040
Like this 20 if you go to UFC one and then go to one on one number,

912
00:51:03.511 --> 00:51:03.901
we all know,

913
00:51:03.901 --> 00:51:08.901
or (707) 087-0870 seven if you go and just go to 2014 2003 or 1993 to 2014 it's

914
00:51:15.291 --> 00:51:19.520
gone through like a thousand years of evolution that the level is so different.

915
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:23.870
The level of athleticism,
the level of endurance,
the martial arts skill,

916
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.330
like everything's different.
Everything's different.

917
00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:30.630
<v 3>I I,
I think it's one of the things I love about it the most and like people will</v>

918
00:51:30.631 --> 00:51:34.650
talk John Johnson and core me a or like having all this heat and they asked me

919
00:51:34.651 --> 00:51:37.200
about it.
It's like,
well I don't care.
It's interesting.

920
00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:40.800
But for me the biggest thing about one of the,
I always say the biggest thing,

921
00:51:40.801 --> 00:51:42.990
cause I also love the science.
I also love the brain chemistry.

922
00:51:42.991 --> 00:51:44.670
I love the beauty of the dance,
all of it.

923
00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:49.530
But one of the things I'm most interested in is it's basically one global

924
00:51:49.531 --> 00:51:53.970
science experiment in real time using thousands and thousands and thousands of

925
00:51:53.971 --> 00:51:58.200
fights to distill down to the nugget of what's the best and it's still is that

926
00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:02.730
every 500 fights,
the best coaches are going,
okay,
well that doesn't work anymore.

927
00:52:02.731 --> 00:52:03.570
Well we've added that.

928
00:52:03.571 --> 00:52:08.571
That works and it's just ongoing distillation down to the purest way to beat

929
00:52:08.791 --> 00:52:09.271
other guys.

930
00:52:09.271 --> 00:52:13.530
That changes slightly now because of this sort of demand for entertainment from

931
00:52:13.531 --> 00:52:16.050
the audience and stuff that changes.
Like you know,

932
00:52:16.051 --> 00:52:20.250
guys are rewarded more for standing now than in certain things so that Ultracet

933
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:24.360
but you re you take that out of it and basically we just have thousands and

934
00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:28.470
thousands of contests all there to help us determine the research of how to be

935
00:52:28.471 --> 00:52:29.304
the best fighter.

936
00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:32.360
<v 0>Yeah,
I have issue with that aspect of it.</v>

937
00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:37.380
The were the technical aspect of fights changes for it to be more entertaining.

938
00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:39.420
I think it's not good.

939
00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:43.560
I think it's not smart and I think it takes away from the purity of mixed

940
00:52:43.561 --> 00:52:46.530
martial arts expression.
Like what?
What is martial arts?

941
00:52:46.531 --> 00:52:49.560
It's all about doing the very best thing in order to win a fight.

942
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:53.500
And if you put yourself more in danger so the crowd roars and you know,

943
00:52:53.501 --> 00:52:55.410
like just drop your hands,
Duke it up.

944
00:52:55.620 --> 00:53:00.150
I remember a guy who was a friend of mine wrote something on Twitter and he

945
00:53:00.151 --> 00:53:03.420
wrote a,
you know,
fuck technical striking,
you know,

946
00:53:03.421 --> 00:53:05.550
just stand in the center of the cage and let it bang.

947
00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:08.910
And meanwhile the guy who wrote that is all fucked up.

948
00:53:08.911 --> 00:53:11.910
Now he's got all sorts of physical problems.
He's had a bunch of fights,

949
00:53:11.911 --> 00:53:16.320
he's all banged up and it's like,
no,
don't know.
Don't think that,

950
00:53:16.321 --> 00:53:20.760
don't say that.
Like put,
that's the,
that is like,
you know,

951
00:53:20.761 --> 00:53:25.680
like uh,
you know,
fuck,
fuck thinking I'm just going to hit this with a hammer.
No,

952
00:53:25.681 --> 00:53:26.100
no.

953
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.470
<v 5>You have to think like that's the whole thing.</v>

954
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:33.620
The whole thing is solving the puzzle and solving the puzzle in striking is

955
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:36.690
about technical striking.
It doesn't mean no knockouts.

956
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.300
There's a lot of knockouts that come from tactical strikers.

957
00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:44.040
It's means doing it the right way where you have the most amount of success,

958
00:53:44.041 --> 00:53:48.120
the least amount of risk and you're doing things based on the amount of

959
00:53:48.121 --> 00:53:51.900
knowledge that's been accumulated over thousands of years of martial arts.

960
00:53:51.901 --> 00:53:55.170
You were applying that and intelligent way Johnson,

961
00:53:55.171 --> 00:53:58.140
Demetrius Johnson in my opinion is the best example of that.

962
00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:02.250
That fucking guy does everything right.
Everything he does is perfect.

963
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:03.750
He doesn't rush anything.

964
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:08.280
He's never seen him slugging it out and then fucking drop it his hands and like

965
00:54:08.281 --> 00:54:10.590
come on bitch,
come on.
But there's none of that stupidity.

966
00:54:10.591 --> 00:54:14.760
It's all brilliant martial arts and he's so exciting to watch.

967
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:15.810
I mean I I,

968
00:54:15.811 --> 00:54:19.680
you know sometimes people say it's not as exciting cause you just not finishing

969
00:54:19.681 --> 00:54:20.281
guys as much,

970
00:54:20.281 --> 00:54:24.210
but he fucking finished John Moraga and the fourth round of a fight that he was

971
00:54:24.211 --> 00:54:28.620
dominating.
He finished Joseph Benevidez one punch guy in the world in this way.

972
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:32.040
Exactly.
You know,
he's a beast and Bhagwati enough,

973
00:54:32.041 --> 00:54:35.750
the only reason why I didn't finish him cause he's EPO to the fucking gills and

974
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:40.380
who knows what else.
Yeah.
I mean he is such a part of it.

975
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:44.570
Yes.
It's such an enormous part of it.
If you are,
you know,

976
00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:48.900
if everything is else's equal but you're in better shape than the guy eventually

977
00:54:48.901 --> 00:54:51.420
it's no longer he mall.
It's really that simple.
Well,

978
00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:54.060
that's the Nick Diaz strategy.
Nick Diaz Strategy.

979
00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:56.940
Nick is obviously a very high level martial artist when it comes to his

980
00:54:56.941 --> 00:55:00.480
technique and his experience and he's obviously very,
very tough guy,

981
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:04.230
but he's also in fucking phenomenal shave.

982
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:09.470
Nick Diaz is swam back from Alcatraz twice in the fucking Pacific Ocean outside

983
00:55:10.741 --> 00:55:14.970
San Francisco,
filled with sharks.
Okay.
He swam back twice.

984
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:19.440
He's done triathletes,
triathlons.
He's done marathons.

985
00:55:19.441 --> 00:55:23.280
I mean he's a fucking beast when it comes to his physical conditioning and what

986
00:55:23.281 --> 00:55:28.050
he does is just puts a pace.
He just makes you run with them like,
come on,

987
00:55:28.051 --> 00:55:28.371
let's go.

988
00:55:28.371 --> 00:55:31.770
We'll go and run and we're going running and he starts throwing these punches

989
00:55:31.771 --> 00:55:34.690
that are like 50% speed.
Hey,
come catch me coming.

990
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:38.430
Killing mentally get you pulled in there.
He's good at that too.
Oh yeah.

991
00:55:38.431 --> 00:55:42.840
He starts,
come on bitch.
Come on bitch.
That gets you vial.
Oh,
it's brilliant.

992
00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:47.100
You Know Jack Slack.
Sure.
Yeah man.
That guy is doing killer stuff.

993
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.440
Excellent stuff.
Yeah,
great breakdowns.

994
00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:53.130
A little group of people at their to niche in a niche and I'm proud to be part

995
00:55:53.131 --> 00:55:57.120
of it.
Mine,
I stand there and do mine.
But Jack is fucking good.

996
00:55:57.270 --> 00:56:02.250
And this young Guy Lawrence Kenshin is,
yes,
I was going to mention him.
Excellent.

997
00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:03.480
Great breakdowns.

998
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:08.040
And I'm so happy that like there's these guys doing it and instead of God who's

999
00:56:08.041 --> 00:56:11.970
that fucking guy,
I'm better than him whether we end up kind of we're friends.

1000
00:56:11.971 --> 00:56:13.770
So it Kinda like pushing each other.
It's really,

1001
00:56:13.771 --> 00:56:16.740
it's an interesting thing about MMA commentary that's like that as well.

1002
00:56:16.741 --> 00:56:17.940
Like I'm really good friends with Michael.

1003
00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:21.270
She'll velo really good friends with Jimmy Smith.
I worked with Mike twice,

1004
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.770
good friends with Jason Chambers as well.
He's a great buddy

1005
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:27.640
<v 1>and because I'm friends with all these guys that also do my job,</v>

1006
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:30.520
like there's no like competition amongst each other.

1007
00:56:30.521 --> 00:56:33.780
Like I tried to get Jimmy Smith hired by the UFC.
Oh,
I tell you,

1008
00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:36.730
when Jimmy Smith was,
his contract was going up with Bella tour,

1009
00:56:36.731 --> 00:56:39.910
I called Dana White and I said,
dude,
this guy's the best.
He's great.

1010
00:56:39.911 --> 00:56:43.660
He's really good.
He's a real martial artist.
He's a real good guy.
I go,

1011
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:45.860
he should work for us.
You know,
he's,
he's fucking great.
Okay.

1012
00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.370
<v 3>Balachandra must've understood he was so valuable.</v>

1013
00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:50.830
<v 1>Well,
they would.
Yeah,
they were.
Well,
they were worried also.</v>

1014
00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:53.500
They would worry that who the fuck else is out there.
I mean,

1015
00:56:53.501 --> 00:56:57.460
it's a really tough Gig to have a person who's very passionate and very

1016
00:56:57.461 --> 00:56:58.091
articulate,

1017
00:56:58.091 --> 00:57:02.290
which Jimmy is both and it's really good at breaking down scenarios and

1018
00:57:02.291 --> 00:57:05.950
situations and is legitimately passionate while the fights going on.

1019
00:57:05.951 --> 00:57:10.690
Like you could see it.
And also not afraid to call out bad refereeing,
bad calls,

1020
00:57:10.691 --> 00:57:13.410
bad judgements.
And he's really like it.

1021
00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:16.390
It's very important to him to be honest about the whole scene.

1022
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:20.650
There's not that many guys out there.
So if they,
if Bella did lose Jimmy,

1023
00:57:20.651 --> 00:57:24.610
like who the fuck else?
Who Do they get all my fights?
Yeah,

1024
00:57:24.611 --> 00:57:27.130
they probably would call you and you would do a great job.
I'm sure.

1025
00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:30.790
I mean that Brian Stan does a great job.
That's Kenny Florian of course,

1026
00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:31.633
does a great job

1027
00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:32.430
<v 3>guy.</v>

1028
00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:35.880
He's always been one of my favorites because he's a regular guy who just figured

1029
00:57:35.881 --> 00:57:39.120
out how to get the answers to the shit he needed to get to.
You know what I mean?

1030
00:57:39.121 --> 00:57:42.220
Like he wasn't some big powerful genetic specimen.
Right.

1031
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:45.540
He was kind of a nerd who's like,
if I can just figure out how to do this.
Okay,

1032
00:57:45.541 --> 00:57:48.630
that worked.
But this didn't and overtime and he analyzes the same way.

1033
00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:52.410
But where I was going with Jack talking about Jack is he did this,
I'm sure Tim,

1034
00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:56.960
I'm remembering this amazing breakdown on um,
Nick Diaz.
Yes.

1035
00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:59.970
And I'm pretty sure it was jack.
If it isn't,
if it was a different guy,

1036
00:57:59.971 --> 00:58:00.780
I apologize,

1037
00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:05.580
but it's looking at Nick Diaz is striking compared to old school bare knuckle

1038
00:58:05.581 --> 00:58:06.930
boxers.
You know,

1039
00:58:06.931 --> 00:58:10.380
the guys who were the mustaches fighting like this and it looks at it and

1040
00:58:10.381 --> 00:58:13.020
there's so many comparisons.
Weighed on the front leg,

1041
00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:17.060
catching punches with the top of his head.
Like so many.

1042
00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:20.040
It's so brilliant at,
I'm pretty,
it must be Jack.

1043
00:58:20.041 --> 00:58:21.330
Cause Jack the best guy out there.

1044
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:25.000
<v 1>Yeah,
he's done a bunch of great stuff.
Yeah.
He even wrote a,</v>

1045
00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.630
he wrote a whole piece on George Saint Pierre Versus Nick Diaz,

1046
00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:32.860
which is in advance of it or after.
Yeah.
I believe it was in advance and,

1047
00:58:32.861 --> 00:58:35.040
and he wrote a breakdown afterwards.
He writes

1048
00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.580
<v 3>bunch of those things,
man.
He's got,
yeah,
he's writing.</v>

1049
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:41.890
Part of the reason he's so good is he's working so much.
He's in that zone,

1050
00:58:41.891 --> 00:58:45.440
you know,
but nobody knows who he really is.
And uh,

1051
00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:47.660
does anybody know what he looks like?
No,
I think he,

1052
00:58:47.661 --> 00:58:51.070
I mean he doesn't want that and I think that's super cool.
I think he's British.

1053
00:58:51.071 --> 00:58:55.060
I'm pretty sure he's,
I believe he has too.
But uh,
it's cool man.

1054
00:58:55.061 --> 00:58:58.660
It's a little niche but people are finding it interesting.
I always feel like,

1055
00:58:59.020 --> 00:58:59.351
you know,

1056
00:58:59.351 --> 00:59:04.351
you look at other sports and on Monday the ESPN will have a two hour show and

1057
00:59:04.901 --> 00:59:07.000
they will go into what happened.
And it won't be like,

1058
00:59:07.001 --> 00:59:10.910
well this guy threw a thing and the the highlight will only be the catch the

1059
00:59:10.911 --> 00:59:12.760
show,
what happened at the line.
They'll show,

1060
00:59:12.761 --> 00:59:15.100
they'll talk about what kind of plays these guys calling and stuff.

1061
00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:18.730
That kind of analysis,
like all you guys do a fucking killer job,

1062
00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:23.190
but the before and the after and that's an area I was wishing the UFC

1063
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:27.770
concentrated on more,
especially during the really passion years.

1064
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:28.710
Like the,

1065
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:32.300
the heavy work has always been on the hype and the excitement and this guy hates

1066
00:59:32.301 --> 00:59:33.740
and these two are the best and stuff.

1067
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:39.190
But during that era you feel like if you got 20% or 30% or 40% of the audience

1068
00:59:40.101 --> 00:59:41.900
to be obsessed with the technique.

1069
00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:45.560
And I think a lot of times people went and showed how to do a triangle,

1070
00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:49.240
not how to watch a triangle.
You know what I mean?
You know?

1071
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:53.360
But it feels like in a lot of other sports there are,

1072
00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:56.500
they have spent time to develop a PR,

1073
00:59:56.570 --> 01:00:00.710
a certain percentage of the audience that is there because baseball does some

1074
01:00:00.711 --> 01:00:02.780
crazy shit.
I Dunno what happens in baseball,

1075
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:06.560
but there are guys that talk about how the field moves and what guys do when

1076
01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:10.220
they're like with Rosin and shit and if football they talk about how the plays

1077
01:00:10.221 --> 01:00:10.491
are called,

1078
01:00:10.491 --> 01:00:14.420
what the subtleties are and you don't see that before and after in the UFC.

1079
01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.270
<v 0>Yeah,
I agree with you know,</v>

1080
01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:20.010
it'd be nice to see that they're doing a lot of that though on the,
uh,

1081
01:00:20.011 --> 01:00:22.860
the breakdowns that they do on Fox,
on Fox sports,

1082
01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:26.060
like Carlos condit does a fantastic job of that.
No,

1083
01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:28.890
I'm not going to say Carlos condit other than me and Carlos condit.

1084
01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:33.750
Who the fuck who the,
who does that?
Um,
Dominick Cruz.

1085
01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:35.130
Donald Cruz does a great job of it

1086
01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:38.840
<v 3>to speak in like you're talking about Tom,
Demetrius Johnson,
Dominick Cruz.</v>

1087
01:00:38.841 --> 01:00:40.940
If he can come back the way that he was,

1088
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.270
he's one of those super brilliant mind blowing performance too.

1089
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:47.440
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
he's,
he's great as far as movement,</v>

1090
01:00:47.441 --> 01:00:51.520
foot work and his conditioning is always top notch to Dominic is just so good at

1091
01:00:51.521 --> 01:00:54.220
like not being there like you,
you,

1092
01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.000
you swing for him and he's off to the left and then he's countering you off to

1093
01:00:58.001 --> 01:01:01.330
the right and you're like,
fuck him.
Where is this guy?
But he does a great job.

1094
01:01:01.331 --> 01:01:06.331
Like he did a great breakdown of Lee versus a rich Franklin explaining it drew

1095
01:01:07.601 --> 01:01:12.030
out the right hook.
Yeah,
I did a great job of explaining like,
you know when,

1096
01:01:12.031 --> 01:01:13.000
when someone is like,

1097
01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:16.360
like head straight up in the air and they don't move off the center line.

1098
01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.940
That shit drives me crazy.
I watched it.
I was like,

1099
01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:22.120
fucking who's training you like why are you like,
what's going on here?

1100
01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:27.210
And then you watch a guy like TJ Dillashaw so satisfying because he does all the

1101
01:01:27.311 --> 01:01:30.400
right things because he's constantly moving off the center line because he's

1102
01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:34.030
completely unpredictable.
So like when Dominic did a great,

1103
01:01:34.031 --> 01:01:37.810
he did a great breakdown,
what Franklin did wrong and where the errors were.

1104
01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:41.410
And he's done that for a bunch of different fights.
Don was really good at it.

1105
01:01:41.650 --> 01:01:45.520
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
He's fucking talented.
Uh,
there,
uh,
went into,</v>

1106
01:01:45.521 --> 01:01:48.250
we were talking about Duane Ludwig,
when he's teaching,
he'll say,

1107
01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:51.100
you make no errors unless you're making them on purpose.

1108
01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:54.280
And what he means by that is if you,
obviously you show,
oh,

1109
01:01:54.281 --> 01:01:55.870
this is here and the guy will throw a punch.

1110
01:01:55.871 --> 01:01:58.360
We want them to do that and we'll respond.
And there was,

1111
01:01:58.390 --> 01:02:03.310
there's a really wild heavy case of it where you see,
and I broke it down and,

1112
01:02:03.311 --> 01:02:05.980
and uh,
if you even just look at the fight itself,

1113
01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:09.730
you see it as soon as somebody I mentioned it was,
um,

1114
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:14.940
Jack Ira versus a Okami,
right?

1115
01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:20.040
So shock Caray the whole fight,
all he's got in mind is the overhand right.

1116
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.780
<v 4>And the way for him to draw that out is,
you know,
how everybody who,
you know,</v>

1117
01:02:23.781 --> 01:02:25.920
are they talking about that,
where the front foot goes,
you know,

1118
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:26.820
against a southpaw.

1119
01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:31.800
He's got his front foot intentionally inside and he's offering a straight line

1120
01:02:31.801 --> 01:02:34.470
to his chin for the straight left.
And it'll call me.

1121
01:02:34.471 --> 01:02:38.010
You can see him seeing it and going,
Nah Shit,
he wants me to throw that,

1122
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:42.930
oh shit he's doing,
he's ready to counter it.
And the hesitation on Okami is like,

1123
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.650
it's such a fascinating moment as a guys go going,
look,

1124
01:02:46.651 --> 01:02:49.050
I'm out here or you can hit me with it.
And he's going,

1125
01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:51.930
oh he's telling me I can hit him with it.
But he's got that right hand ready.

1126
01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.750
And then just those moments to me are the fascinating shit.

1127
01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.120
<v 0>Well it's also even more fascinating,</v>

1128
01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.260
it comes to garlic joc arrays because if you do engage the real fears that he's

1129
01:03:00.261 --> 01:03:01.250
going to take you down.
Yeah,

1130
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:05.480
there's always this thing when you're striking with a guy who such an elite

1131
01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:08.960
grappler.
It's like this guy is trying to goad me into a slug fest,

1132
01:03:08.961 --> 01:03:11.390
but I know that he's going to change levels and take me down at any moment.

1133
01:03:11.391 --> 01:03:15.290
So you're always hesitant to really commit the shots and extend yourself.

1134
01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:16.250
Cause if you extend yourself,

1135
01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:20.180
it makes it much more difficult to defend a take down.
A guy like Okami is also,

1136
01:03:20.181 --> 01:03:24.410
or a guy like Jacques Rey rather is also fascinating because started out his

1137
01:03:24.411 --> 01:03:28.790
career as one of the elite of the elite and grappling and really at bad striking

1138
01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:31.600
in the beginning like you watch is when he got knocked out by Makoko.

1139
01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.390
Just his striking was just very rudimentary,
which wasn't very good.

1140
01:03:35.391 --> 01:03:38.540
But now he's destroying guys with striking.

1141
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:40.550
Like he beat the fucking shit out of you can,
okay,

1142
01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:44.810
you should know Cami with striking and like that's terrifying to people because

1143
01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:49.960
now you take this guy who is this just phenomenal top 1% of all grapplers ever.

1144
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:54.920
I mean I think John like lead Jujitsu guys,

1145
01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.750
he's like top 1% ever and now destroying people with stand up.

1146
01:03:59.751 --> 01:04:04.340
It's like the focus that made him a great Jujitsu fighter and the athleticism is

1147
01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:06.340
now making him an elite striker and that's

1148
01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.980
<v 4>terrified that what I have,</v>

1149
01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:14.060
it's always kind of an additional terrifying is that you don't see him for like

1150
01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:17.340
a year when a guy's not around for a year.
You're like,
what the fuck is he doing?

1151
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.040
Right?
Like what does he have now?
What new things does he have?
Right.

1152
01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:23.670
What does he do better?
What's way faster than it was a year ago?

1153
01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:25.590
That always scares the shit out of me.

1154
01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:28.980
Likes excites you and there's a fight coming,
but you're like,
shit man.

1155
01:04:28.981 --> 01:04:31.320
What has this guy been doing in the lab for the last year?

1156
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.700
Maybe he's got some crazy shit we don't even know about.

1157
01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:36.660
<v 0>Yeah,
well he's definitely getting better.
He's not slacking off.</v>

1158
01:04:36.661 --> 01:04:37.500
I guarantee you that.

1159
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:40.890
But did you see when he got elbow surgery and they cleaned out his elbow,

1160
01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:42.810
did you see that?
Oh,
oh,
pull that up.

1161
01:04:42.811 --> 01:04:47.811
Jamie Shakuri Elbow surgery pictures he had before he fought Francis Garment.

1162
01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.710
Um,
he had uh,

1163
01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:57.770
like be like a really bad but like bone spurs and chips and shit inside of his

1164
01:04:59.101 --> 01:05:01.380
elbow.
It was like,
you know,

1165
01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.590
all the years of elbowing people and also of getting arm barred,

1166
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:09.330
like things break off inside your elbow and it becomes like crunchy and you're

1167
01:05:09.331 --> 01:05:13.170
moving it around.
It's just all inflammation and tissue damage.
And,

1168
01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:16.140
and look,
we'll show it to you up on the big screen,

1169
01:05:16.141 --> 01:05:18.620
but it's really fucking crazy.
Like

1170
01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:23.800
<v 4>cop,
ah,
things,
oh they removed from his elbow,
got teeth in his album out.</v>

1171
01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:24.880
It looks like teeth

1172
01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:30.040
chunks of bone and cartilage and all rip it apart.

1173
01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:33.890
All the stuff around and on top.
You know what people don't,
you know,

1174
01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:34.751
how could they,

1175
01:05:34.751 --> 01:05:39.751
but nobody really sees a guy like who's a black belt level guys,

1176
01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:41.710
but training you guys,

1177
01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:45.760
you and Eddie and and a shot at least black belt level guys train all their
life.

1178
01:05:45.761 --> 01:05:49.960
They have no idea what that does to their joints and their bodies like Jiu
Jitsu,

1179
01:05:49.961 --> 01:05:54.200
so fucking fit,
vicious sport.
Like it's a hard vicious sport.

1180
01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:58.000
Guys will kickboxers we'll look over at the Jujitsu area and they see the guys

1181
01:05:58.001 --> 01:06:00.640
stretching and stuff and like,
oh look these guys,
they won't,

1182
01:06:00.641 --> 01:06:02.410
they don't want no part of that.
They don't want to go in there,

1183
01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:06.550
have the skeleton all stacked by a guy like yeah it's a vicious sport

1184
01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:09.870
<v 0>or that I'm realizing like one of the things that I did,</v>

1185
01:06:10.290 --> 01:06:14.880
I made some mistakes with my Jujitsu training and one of the mistakes that I

1186
01:06:14.881 --> 01:06:18.690
made was for a long time I didn't do any strength and conditioning equipment.

1187
01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:20.190
There's strength and conditioning training.

1188
01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:25.220
I did mostly just Jujitsu like for years and years I would lift ways like maybe

1189
01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:26.280
once a week or something like that.

1190
01:06:26.281 --> 01:06:29.640
I get a little lift in just to kind of maintain my strength and size,

1191
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:33.510
but I didn't specifically like strengthen my core strength and my spine,

1192
01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:38.000
strengthen certain areas and strach constantly stretch.

1193
01:06:38.001 --> 01:06:42.120
Like you got to put as much time almost into that as you do in your Jujitsu

1194
01:06:42.121 --> 01:06:46.350
training just to armor up your body just to,
just to armor up your joints,

1195
01:06:46.351 --> 01:06:51.351
not so that you can overpower guys and like not concentrate on technique,

1196
01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:55.500
which a lot of people do have a problem with like really strong like football

1197
01:06:55.501 --> 01:06:56.330
players.

1198
01:06:56.330 --> 01:07:00.450
Big guys tend to try to muscle things instead of like the really technical guys

1199
01:07:00.451 --> 01:07:03.780
are always the really small guys because they don't have the muscle up option.

1200
01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:08.280
So their option is only do use the proper technique and leverage.
But you,

1201
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.820
the strengthening your body is important just to prevent injuries,

1202
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:15.990
strengthen your hamstrings to prevent knee injuries,
strengthen your quads,

1203
01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:19.320
prevent knee injuries,
strengthening your neck,
strengthening your back,

1204
01:07:19.321 --> 01:07:21.840
like strengthened lower back stretching.

1205
01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:25.170
All that's like a lot of guys slack off on that Shit.
And I did too.

1206
01:07:25.171 --> 01:07:28.710
And I got some,
some pretty serious back injuries because of that,

1207
01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:31.950
because I wasn't strengthening those areas.
You know,

1208
01:07:31.951 --> 01:07:36.240
like for the longest time I very rarely worked my back.

1209
01:07:36.241 --> 01:07:39.870
I didn't do like rose or any like exercises specifically.

1210
01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:43.890
So having like an issue with disks and stuff like that forced me to really

1211
01:07:43.891 --> 01:07:44.760
concentrate on that.

1212
01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:48.880
<v 4>Yeah,
that's nasty stuff.
Yeah.
And then,
you know,
guys get back injuries,</v>

1213
01:07:48.881 --> 01:07:51.530
head gets the doctors give him like opiates and stuff.

1214
01:07:51.531 --> 01:07:55.700
That shit can wreck their lives.
Oh,
bad back injury leads to something like that.

1215
01:07:55.701 --> 01:08:00.400
And next thing you know,
you're,
you're Tanya flading dudes for money for,
hey,

1216
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:04.670
how'd you get there?
It was a lot,
bit of a leap I recognize.
But what does your,

1217
01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:08.000
what is your martial arts background?
When did you start doing martial arts?

1218
01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:11.600
I started by nine a taekwondo.
I have a black belt in taekwondo.

1219
01:08:11.601 --> 01:08:16.550
I trained through Canada.
Oh,
Toronto.
Yeah,
a chaos Cho College.
I lived,

1220
01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:18.440
grew up in Manitoba and you know what,

1221
01:08:18.650 --> 01:08:21.980
like my parents are the coolest people ever on earth.

1222
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:26.540
I was just like a weird kid and I really was like Bruce Lee and stuff.

1223
01:08:26.541 --> 01:08:28.520
Like I was really interested in martial arts.
The end.

1224
01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.010
I was pretty hyper and odd and it didn't have a lot of focus.

1225
01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:33.680
And they once they said,
if you're serious about this,
we'll do it.

1226
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:37.370
They would drive me an hour and a half each direction to Winnipeg to go train

1227
01:08:37.371 --> 01:08:41.630
three times a week for my whole fucking as a kid.
It was amazing.

1228
01:08:41.631 --> 01:08:46.160
It changed my whole Byron's mom.
It changed my whole life.
And,
uh,
you know,

1229
01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.230
I competed,
I did really well and stuff and,

1230
01:08:48.231 --> 01:08:51.740
and I enjoyed it and I did a little box,
I had an interest in every martial art,

1231
01:08:51.741 --> 01:08:55.690
so I did a little sicker on which is like a Filipino martial arts sicker on,

1232
01:08:55.770 --> 01:09:00.560
how do you spell it's s,
I.
K.
A.
R.
A.
N.
And you know,
no,

1233
01:09:00.690 --> 01:09:05.120
rns and Colleen are an offshoot of sicker on what's a Filipino martial arts and

1234
01:09:05.121 --> 01:09:06.410
it's very much like taekwondo.

1235
01:09:06.411 --> 01:09:10.820
But when they compete they stick their hands in their belt and it's mall spin

1236
01:09:10.821 --> 01:09:13.910
kicks in,
Hook kicks and shit.
It's super cool.
They put their hands,

1237
01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:17.720
they compete like wide stance with their head far back,

1238
01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.810
lots of hook kicks off the front and the no hands,
it's a kicking,

1239
01:09:20.811 --> 01:09:25.280
it's like savant almost savant does have hands now modified to have hands over

1240
01:09:25.281 --> 01:09:28.260
time.
But,
but so I did a lot of that at our,
no walking,

1241
01:09:28.650 --> 01:09:31.790
no all moving your head and your body.
It was like really,

1242
01:09:31.791 --> 01:09:36.140
it was just a very Winnipeg thing.
This one central area of,
of Canada,

1243
01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:39.830
this Filipino master of it came there and he started the school.

1244
01:09:39.831 --> 01:09:43.670
He was a really good businessman so it ended up being on in the whole world.

1245
01:09:43.671 --> 01:09:44.840
If you looked at were sick around,

1246
01:09:44.841 --> 01:09:47.210
was taught the Philippines and there was a chunk,

1247
01:09:47.211 --> 01:09:50.120
a little red.in the middle of Canada because this guy was there and he had a

1248
01:09:50.121 --> 01:09:53.180
bunch of schools and people study it.
A lot of Filipino population.

1249
01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:57.830
So I did a little of that and then we have to stick around.
It's really cool.

1250
01:09:57.831 --> 01:10:01.220
Check it out.
I don't know how much they'll be a modern stuff on the internet,

1251
01:10:01.221 --> 01:10:03.770
but it's basically a ton of round kicks,

1252
01:10:03.771 --> 01:10:06.710
Hook kicks and spin kicks with your weight heavy on the back leg.

1253
01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:11.570
So it's sort of like kicking like a martial arts version of soccer.
Yeah.

1254
01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:14.260
Use your hands like fencing with your feet.
You want me to look?

1255
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:18.950
You can't even like block.
That's so ridiculous.
Yeah,
it's really weird.
I mean,

1256
01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:23.090
but his boxing or did cause you can only punch.
Yeah,
but at least you can block.

1257
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:28.490
I guess that actually you would see a lot of cars over the IOWAS found it

1258
01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:31.820
interesting.
Even just as a kid I was curious guys would be doing,

1259
01:10:31.821 --> 01:10:34.910
you'd go to the tournament's in guys are all doing hook kicks and then shift

1260
01:10:34.911 --> 01:10:35.780
forward and spin kick.

1261
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:39.680
All of a sudden guys started doing this from there where they would just bounce

1262
01:10:39.681 --> 01:10:42.320
on their back leg cooking and,
and round kicking.

1263
01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:44.680
So they bounced towards each other during that.
So they're tapping.

1264
01:10:44.890 --> 01:10:48.860
It's just an interesting thing as a teenager to see.
And then I got,

1265
01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:51.980
I started playing in a rock band in my 20th since I didn't do much martial arts

1266
01:10:51.981 --> 01:10:54.950
at all.
Afternoon practice music before that.

1267
01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:58.820
Like when did you get involved in I was uh,
growing up as a kid,

1268
01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:02.750
Bruce Lee and Alice Cooper were like my two,
the Glam rock

1269
01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.070
and a late mid twenties.

1270
01:11:07.071 --> 01:11:10.250
I started playing in a band and I really like performing and I did a lot of

1271
01:11:10.251 --> 01:11:14.020
jumping and kicking and wearing tight pants and you know,
I like it was superior.

1272
01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:17.790
The Rostow exactly,
exactly.
And,
uh,
somewhere.

1273
01:11:17.791 --> 01:11:21.780
But June David Lee Roth in the New York dolls and very drunk,
very,

1274
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:26.700
very fucked up like through the whole era.
Like we would go and we,
oh man.

1275
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:28.560
And I told Eddie this story.

1276
01:11:28.561 --> 01:11:31.110
I haven't told a lot of people this story but people ask me about it if my

1277
01:11:31.111 --> 01:11:32.190
friends ask me about it recently,

1278
01:11:32.191 --> 01:11:35.190
but I was basically on tour so I can do that for like 10,
12,

1279
01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:40.080
14 years and we were touring England in the UK and um,
and uh,

1280
01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:42.300
like,
um,
it'll leave in a few places like that.

1281
01:11:42.301 --> 01:11:46.530
We did really well over there and I had a seizure from just doing so much drugs

1282
01:11:46.531 --> 01:11:49.170
and drinking so much and like a bad,

1283
01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:52.040
like you basically I had been the,

1284
01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:56.100
when I came back the doctor said the vodka and red bull was actually the biggest

1285
01:11:56.490 --> 01:11:57.271
component.

1286
01:11:57.271 --> 01:12:00.060
The fact that I took a lot of speed over the three days without sleeping,

1287
01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:01.800
let me drink more vodka,
red ball.

1288
01:12:01.801 --> 01:12:05.430
But basically as the sugar leaves your body,

1289
01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:09.360
it goes down and you and you get sick.
And when the alcohol then leaves her body,

1290
01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:12.150
it draws more sugar and you have a hypoglycemic seizure.

1291
01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.160
So I lied laying on the couch.

1292
01:12:14.161 --> 01:12:17.400
I felt terrible for like 10 hours and then all of a sudden apparently I just

1293
01:12:17.401 --> 01:12:21.750
yelled something and people came over and I felt this electricity shoot down my

1294
01:12:21.751 --> 01:12:25.680
arms into my hands and they just locked up and I rolled back down in my eyes,

1295
01:12:25.681 --> 01:12:26.514
rolled in my head.

1296
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:29.430
I thought it was 10 seconds later and everyone's looking at me like I just got

1297
01:12:29.431 --> 01:12:32.550
knocked out,
you know?
And then apparently it was like a minute or something.

1298
01:12:32.551 --> 01:12:35.160
And I went back and the doctor said,
dude,
you got to get your life together.

1299
01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:38.880
And I started training martial arts again pretty much that day.

1300
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:42.870
And then I trained,
you know,
three times a week,
then five,
then seven,

1301
01:12:42.871 --> 01:12:45.660
then I was doing Jujitsu Monday,
Wednesday,
Friday,

1302
01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:50.661
7:00 AM noon and 6:00 PM and Tuesday and Thursday noon and 6:00 PM and you were

1303
01:12:50.761 --> 01:12:53.850
trained to do two,
three times a day,
three times a day,
Monday,
Wednesday,
Friday,

1304
01:12:53.851 --> 01:12:56.190
twice a day,
Tuesday,
Thursday for about six months.

1305
01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:59.100
And then people kind of knew me a little in Canada,

1306
01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:03.300
like on television doing stuff.
I was like a reality show judge.

1307
01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:05.670
And the network said,
Oh,
you're going to fight.
Well,

1308
01:13:05.671 --> 01:13:09.720
why don't we do a TV show about that?
And that kind of allowed me,

1309
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:12.640
I really want it to be in the fight world.
That's what I love.

1310
01:13:12.641 --> 01:13:14.370
The second I kind of had,
you know,

1311
01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:17.970
been not living a crazy lifestyle.

1312
01:13:17.971 --> 01:13:21.890
All I wanted to do was martial arts and then real really from that minute on and

1313
01:13:21.891 --> 01:13:24.090
that's all I kind of did.
And that's all I was interested in.

1314
01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.200
<v 5>Wow.
Wow.</v>

1315
01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:30.050
That's crazy that you blacked out from red bull and vodka.

1316
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:35.270
So the hypoglycemic aspect of it is just super bad for you.

1317
01:13:35.271 --> 01:13:35.840
Yeah.

1318
01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:40.130
<v 4>Oh yeah.
They,
uh,
in fact out,
and my wife just told me this morning,
unrelated,</v>

1319
01:13:40.131 --> 01:13:42.990
she said she was on the Internet and she said,
uh,

1320
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:47.690
Toronto looking to ban vodka or alcohol and red bull served in bars just,

1321
01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.090
just popped up this morning on the Internet.

1322
01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.270
<v 5>That's so crazy.
I never thought of that as a bad drink.
Yeah.</v>

1323
01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:56.320
<v 4>Yeah.
At the very dangerous,
this apparently law.
Once you,</v>

1324
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:58.720
something like that happens to you,
you look it up on the Internet,

1325
01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:02.810
there's a lot of that going on.
HYP hypoglycemic seizures as a result

1326
01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:06.760
<v 5>of vodka.
Redbulls that's so funny.
Well,
when it's hypoglycemia,</v>

1327
01:14:06.850 --> 01:14:10.820
what have you used?
Sugar free.
Red Bull.
Does it have a lesson than hell?
Yeah.

1328
01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:12.110
Help you come to try and give me,

1329
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:15.670
<v 0>give me the equaling folks.
Give it a go.
I feel like,
um,</v>

1330
01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:19.600
it's always like a weird thing when you mix an upper and a downer too.
Right?

1331
01:14:19.601 --> 01:14:21.490
And that's what you're doing with alcohol and red bull.

1332
01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:23.740
If you smoke a better weed and you strike a coffee,

1333
01:14:23.741 --> 01:14:25.900
it's kind of on the same thing.
Not really though,

1334
01:14:25.901 --> 01:14:27.700
because I don't think weed is a downer.

1335
01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.990
It's not a downer in terms of like a depressant.
Alcohol is a true depressant.

1336
01:14:31.991 --> 01:14:36.370
Yeah.
We'd like you could smoke a joint and lift weights and have a great work.

1337
01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.110
I can't,
you can't.
You need to hang out with me more.
Yeah,
maybe so.

1338
01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.270
Oh Man.

1339
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:43.660
<v 3>Want to do,
it's like chill out.</v>

1340
01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:46.720
I'll watch fights all to a bit of writing or whatever.
But yeah,

1341
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:48.670
I tend to get a little introverted,

1342
01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:53.530
<v 0>little mellow.
I Dunno.
It's just,
you know,
it's fantastic.
We'd and yoga.
Yeah,</v>

1343
01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:57.610
that would make sense to me.
For Asia,
it's amazing stretching like a,

1344
01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.110
I was talking to my friend Aubrey about this the other day that like a,

1345
01:15:00.111 --> 01:15:05.000
there's this buddy that we know that,
um,
makes these,
uh,
they're called jam bows,

1346
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:09.200
these uh,
these uh,
organic,
um,
uh,
edibles,

1347
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:14.770
but he uses honey instead of like a processed sugar and the really delicious and

1348
01:15:15.111 --> 01:15:17.270
they're super strong and you know,

1349
01:15:17.271 --> 01:15:20.720
Aubrey eight one and then went on this like two hours stretching.

1350
01:15:20.721 --> 01:15:23.210
And like rampage was like,
oh,

1351
01:15:23.211 --> 01:15:25.860
like using a lacrosse ball to roll out all the,

1352
01:15:25.861 --> 01:15:29.630
the tight tissue just makes you really in tune.

1353
01:15:29.631 --> 01:15:31.210
It makes you feel like,
well,

1354
01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:35.570
I like lifting weights on it because it makes me like feel like what my body's

1355
01:15:35.571 --> 01:15:39.790
doing.
I feel like I can get like a sense of better,
I'm more in tune,

1356
01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:40.850
more sensitive.

1357
01:15:41.690 --> 01:15:45.380
<v 3>I'd be afraid of afraid,
but I don't feel like doing something physical.</v>

1358
01:15:45.381 --> 01:15:49.400
But I'd definitely give it a track.
Uh,
it's weightlifting for you.

1359
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:51.740
That's become like a martial art,
right?
It is to me,

1360
01:15:51.741 --> 01:15:55.430
I think of especially Olympic lifting,
that's a martial art.
In what way?

1361
01:15:55.730 --> 01:15:59.810
Like an Olympic lifts,
like say,
um,
you know,
a clean or a snatch,

1362
01:16:00.230 --> 01:16:05.210
you work for forever on the little details to try to make yourself calm enough

1363
01:16:05.211 --> 01:16:07.370
to be able to express yourself with the lift,

1364
01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:11.720
like to be able to really put it all together.
You move one way wrong.
You don't,

1365
01:16:11.721 --> 01:16:14.720
you don't nail the lift.
You distributor wait different in your feet.

1366
01:16:14.721 --> 01:16:15.650
You don't know the left.

1367
01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.830
You don't drive and tire hips together with the same time that you're supposed

1368
01:16:18.831 --> 01:16:20.800
to go up on your toes and shrug.
He don't hit the left.

1369
01:16:20.801 --> 01:16:24.920
So it becomes this ongoing work to try to make this thing better.

1370
01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:31.240
And a man like to doing an Olympic clean to me is one of the great things in the

1371
01:16:31.611 --> 01:16:33.290
world to be able to just really hit.
Yeah.

1372
01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:36.380
<v 0>It's such a full body exercise too.
It's such,</v>

1373
01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:40.980
it's like really enhances your ability to explode anytime you're doing anything

1374
01:16:40.981 --> 01:16:42.690
where you're pushing up from your toes,

1375
01:16:42.691 --> 01:16:46.350
from the ground and extending and lifting it up over your head and forcing your

1376
01:16:46.351 --> 01:16:50.970
whole body go fucking power that up.
Everything,
your whole chain,

1377
01:16:50.971 --> 01:16:55.860
your posterior,
your,
your,
your all your,
your uh,
your,
your core,
your spine.

1378
01:16:55.861 --> 01:17:00.660
Like can you think of your shoulder,
your delts,
your,
your quads,
your toes,

1379
01:17:00.661 --> 01:17:01.860
your toes are pushing.

1380
01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:06.000
That's why like a Steve Maxwell is a big proponent of lifting weights barefoot.

1381
01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:10.310
Yeah.
He thinks that,
you know,
when you have,
uh,
like especially a spongy

1382
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:12.680
<v 5>Servo,
like a running shoe on with,</v>

1383
01:17:12.681 --> 01:17:16.130
it's like a lot of give that you're not feeling,
you don't,
you're,

1384
01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:19.550
you're not engaging your toes pushing off the ground.

1385
01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:22.790
I'll say take away some of your force.
Some of them for sure.

1386
01:17:22.791 --> 01:17:26.180
Exerting it will kind of absorb it a little bit.
Yeah,
definitely.
They,

1387
01:17:26.181 --> 01:17:28.820
a lot of the Olympic lifters around where I go,
I go to this place,

1388
01:17:28.821 --> 01:17:30.770
Bang fitness in Toronto and it's just like,

1389
01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:34.270
it's the best part of my week to go in there.
And,
um,

1390
01:17:34.410 --> 01:17:37.700
they had most of the guys who Olympic lift just use the tiny,
tiny,

1391
01:17:37.701 --> 01:17:41.900
tiny shoe sole.
Yeah,
I like those.

1392
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:44.480
A lot of people criticize those toe shoes,
you know,

1393
01:17:44.481 --> 01:17:48.440
apparently they made a bunch of ridiculous claims that aren't necessarily true,

1394
01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.230
but I still like it.
I love them for lifting weights.

1395
01:17:51.231 --> 01:17:53.870
They're so comfortable for lifting weights and again,
the same thing.

1396
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:56.420
They're really flat and they make you feel,

1397
01:17:56.570 --> 01:18:00.650
I liked the fact that the toes are all free moving because you can push off with

1398
01:18:00.651 --> 01:18:04.880
those things.
You feel like your connection to the ground.
But yeah,

1399
01:18:04.881 --> 01:18:09.770
I'm a big fan of Olympic lifts.
I'm a big fan of obviously of kettle bells.

1400
01:18:09.771 --> 01:18:14.060
I'm a big fan of anything where you're doing these explosive strength exercises.

1401
01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:18.350
This make your body so much God damn strong,
feel good doing that.
That you know,

1402
01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.020
you talk about drug or or whatever.

1403
01:18:21.021 --> 01:18:24.260
It's like you get endorphins from doing full body that's,
hey,

1404
01:18:24.261 --> 01:18:26.150
have you ever seen that tab on the Internet?

1405
01:18:26.151 --> 01:18:29.840
These kinesiologists broke down in like milliseconds.

1406
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:32.850
Bruce Lee's one inch punch.
Yeah.
Crazy.

1407
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:36.930
And they show that it's actually the order in which his body fires and it's like

1408
01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:38.330
the millisecond,

1409
01:18:38.331 --> 01:18:42.860
the shred of a millisecond in between the different body parts kind of firing

1410
01:18:42.861 --> 01:18:47.090
one after the other.
It's fascinating.
It is fascinating.
You know I used to be a,

1411
01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:49.520
well I'm still,
I'm a huge fan of Mike Tyson,

1412
01:18:49.521 --> 01:18:52.230
but one of the things that I used to always be fascinated about Tyson then

1413
01:18:52.231 --> 01:18:55.490
people didn't comment on is his size of his fucking legs.

1414
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:57.800
Like that's where all the power was coming from.

1415
01:18:58.070 --> 01:19:00.890
He was like pushing off the floor constantly,

1416
01:19:00.891 --> 01:19:05.891
like pushing off the floor and just everything was like thrusting from the

1417
01:19:06.471 --> 01:19:11.150
bottom and when you see a guy punching you assume like,
oh it's his body,

1418
01:19:11.151 --> 01:19:13.100
his upper body,
his arms are throwing the punch.

1419
01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:16.730
But really with like a guy like Tyson,
those vicious power punches.

1420
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:20.480
It was all coming from his ass.
It was called from his toes down,

1421
01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:25.310
pushing off and all his quads and it's upper body throwing it into it.

1422
01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:28.940
It's amazing how much of that is,
how much of your,

1423
01:19:28.941 --> 01:19:33.770
your full body is involved in techniques and a kettle bell.
It's Olympic lifts,

1424
01:19:33.771 --> 01:19:35.750
stuff like that.
That way that that,

1425
01:19:35.751 --> 01:19:38.900
that the bottom half attaches to the top half.

1426
01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:42.650
That's strength in between those two.
That's the big,
definitely the big.

1427
01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:46.640
When you compete,
what way do you compete at one 35 whoa.
How do you make,

1428
01:19:46.641 --> 01:19:50.300
what do you walk around at?
Probably one 58 right now.
Wow.

1429
01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:53.000
That's a lot of drain yourself,
Huh?
Yeah.

1430
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:55.730
I mean when I was fighting for me,

1431
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:58.460
even at the beginning was trying to figure out what's going on,

1432
01:19:58.490 --> 01:20:02.720
like really understand it to a point that I can fairly analyze it and I really

1433
01:20:02.721 --> 01:20:05.210
felt like that I had to go in and do it.
Also,
you want to,

1434
01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:08.040
you become a better person going and doing that,
you know,

1435
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:12.330
<v 4>pushing,
you talked about it just today.
We are you pushing,
taking risks,
going in,</v>

1436
01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.900
putting yourself in harm's way,
putting yourself at risk of failure.
I mean,

1437
01:20:16.090 --> 01:20:18.240
that's part of it,
but really it's to figure out stuff.

1438
01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:22.290
Being forced to make heavyweight as top going to weigh in a seeing I want to

1439
01:20:22.291 --> 01:20:26.310
kill you.
That's all of those experiences.
I think it helped.

1440
01:20:26.311 --> 01:20:29.910
My real calling of allies are fine.
Why did you decide to cut so much weight?

1441
01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:35.240
And it started out my first fight I probably walked around at 145 pounds and

1442
01:20:35.761 --> 01:20:37.440
then you cut weight and your next fight,

1443
01:20:37.441 --> 01:20:40.470
you're 148 pounds and then you cut all that weight and you come back and you

1444
01:20:40.471 --> 01:20:44.760
gain your 150 pounds and over.
I was also 39 when I took my first fight.

1445
01:20:44.761 --> 01:20:45.594
Now I'm 45.

1446
01:20:45.630 --> 01:20:50.590
So over the six years I gained three pounds a year just in muscle.
This,
yeah,

1447
01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:54.300
lifting weights,
working really hard,
changing my life from,
you know,

1448
01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:58.980
eating burgers and shit and drinking beer at lunch to working out twice a day

1449
01:20:58.981 --> 01:21:02.220
and,
and change all of that.
Just added three,
four pounds of muscle a year.

1450
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:05.760
And each time you cut weight after you've gained the weight back,

1451
01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:08.250
you fought this.
And then,
uh,
you know,

1452
01:21:08.251 --> 01:21:10.860
you've had your couple of days to eat pizza and burgers and stuff.

1453
01:21:10.890 --> 01:21:14.640
The weight that you are then is a pound or two heavier than it was the last time

1454
01:21:14.641 --> 01:21:18.090
you were there.
Yeah,
at least it was for me.
Yeah.
At least.
So these guys,

1455
01:21:18.091 --> 01:21:21.930
at least maybe in your thirties and forties so a lot of these guys,
you know,

1456
01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:25.620
they either have a perfect,
and I was going to say they have a perfect diet,

1457
01:21:25.621 --> 01:21:28.530
but a lot of these guys celebrate the way that you deserve to celebrate after he

1458
01:21:28.531 --> 01:21:31.110
fought a fight and they don't have the perfect diet right after.

1459
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:34.800
But it gets that walking around weight creeps up a little bit.

1460
01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:35.850
At least it did for me.

1461
01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:39.330
<v 0>Well,
the lighter weight guys ascent,
traditionally,</v>

1462
01:21:39.331 --> 01:21:42.630
those have been the guys that have the shortest careers.
Yeah.

1463
01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:45.570
The lighter weight guys,
when they get into their thirties it starts to drop off.

1464
01:21:45.571 --> 01:21:47.730
Whereas heavyweights in their thirties,

1465
01:21:47.731 --> 01:21:49.740
a lot of times they're just hitting their prime.
You know,

1466
01:21:49.741 --> 01:21:51.330
like you could have a heavyweight,
like look,

1467
01:21:51.331 --> 01:21:54.960
George Foreman won the heavyweight title at 45 years old,
46 actually,

1468
01:21:55.730 --> 01:22:00.560
and was the oldest heavyweight champion was the oldest boxing champion until

1469
01:22:00.570 --> 01:22:04.670
Bernard Hopkins recently,
which is just the freakiest freaks.
Yeah.

1470
01:22:04.710 --> 01:22:08.640
He's the strangest guy ever.
And he's amazing to me.
How do you get,

1471
01:22:08.641 --> 01:22:11.340
do you know him?
Have you got to no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I need to meet him.

1472
01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:15.810
I've never met him,
but I've,
I've admired his style.
I just love,

1473
01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:19.650
I was amazed back when he beat Kelly Pavlock,
which is like,

1474
01:22:19.651 --> 01:22:23.220
what was that like 2007 or something like that.

1475
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:26.700
You'd look seven years later,
it's still blowing people away.
Wow.

1476
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:30.920
<v 4>It is wild.
Um,
who's that football player that was fighting in a,</v>

1477
01:22:31.210 --> 01:22:35.930
<v 0>was it bell?
Herschel Walker?
Yeah.
You know what?</v>

1478
01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:39.420
He was 48 when he was fighting in Strikeforce.
Yeah,
right.
Oh yeah.

1479
01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:42.360
I'm a strike force shredded.
I mean,

1480
01:22:42.361 --> 01:22:47.190
he was goddamn shredded and it just a beast at 48 and,

1481
01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:51.960
but Hershel Walker's something going on there that's not kosher.

1482
01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:56.970
I mean with his brain because like he says that he eats like a salad and drinks

1483
01:22:56.971 --> 01:22:58.860
a bowl of soup and a day and that's it.

1484
01:22:59.070 --> 01:23:01.410
That's not even possible to keep that kind of math.

1485
01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:05.980
<v 4>Well,
I mean we could get some doctors and dieticians and they would 100% tell us</v>

1486
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.600
<v 5>there's no way that could be true.
Right.</v>

1487
01:23:07.601 --> 01:23:10.840
So when a guy tells you that all he eats is a salad and drinks a cup of soup

1488
01:23:10.841 --> 01:23:14.340
every day.
Okay.
I don't know what he's doing.
He might be fucking with people.

1489
01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:19.330
There's something not kosher about that though.
It's weird,
but he's so yoked.

1490
01:23:19.630 --> 01:23:20.231
It's also,

1491
01:23:20.231 --> 01:23:24.910
it's crazy to see that kind of muscle mass and a 48 year old guy like no loss of

1492
01:23:24.911 --> 01:23:26.890
muscle mass.
In fact like he looks,

1493
01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:31.390
he looks like a 25 year old guy in his prime.
The science,

1494
01:23:31.391 --> 01:23:36.391
I mean it is not cool to suggest that somebody is doing something but not

1495
01:23:36.491 --> 01:23:38.990
talking about him necessarily mean performance enhancing drugs.

1496
01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:44.470
But the science of many guys in their forties fifties sixties and seventies the

1497
01:23:44.471 --> 01:23:49.060
sciences there to make a 65 I mean we've all seen photos of a 70 year old guys

1498
01:23:49.061 --> 01:23:51.850
just shred.
It's the loan.
Yeah.
Yeah,
exactly.

1499
01:23:51.851 --> 01:23:55.930
So loan is like 67 years old now and he's a ripped.

1500
01:23:55.931 --> 01:23:58.630
I wish I had his body.
No,
crazy ridiculous.

1501
01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:02.470
It would be fascinating to get a real one of these guys on the front end of anti

1502
01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:06.820
aging and human performance side,
that science to figure out like,
okay,

1503
01:24:06.821 --> 01:24:09.430
a bodybuilder uses this much growth hormone.

1504
01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:13.780
A guy like say an actor on CSI maybe uses like this much,

1505
01:24:13.810 --> 01:24:17.680
you know like anti aging.
How much is this 70 how much is Stallone using?

1506
01:24:17.681 --> 01:24:21.790
You know what I mean?
To get a sense of where the chemistry is happening.

1507
01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:24.550
Is this more,
is this different?

1508
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:26.650
Do you have the new shit that we don't know about?

1509
01:24:26.651 --> 01:24:29.920
Like what's going on at the elite level?
Like Stallone was.
I don't,
I mean,

1510
01:24:29.921 --> 01:24:32.110
he's not an athlete,
so it's,
it's not a big deal.

1511
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:34.660
But he was caught at a airport once with a whole bunch of,

1512
01:24:34.710 --> 01:24:37.120
it was in Australia because it's illegal in Australia.

1513
01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.610
They have weird laws when it comes to hormones,

1514
01:24:39.630 --> 01:24:43.210
even hormones that are prescribed by doctors that don't show any negative

1515
01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:46.120
effects on the body when used at normal doses.
Meanwhile,

1516
01:24:46.121 --> 01:24:50.190
they have alcohol at every fucking store.
You know,
it's all corn.
Racy,

1517
01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:53.590
it's science.
It's fucking weird medicines where it's ignorance.

1518
01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:58.420
It's not the science or medicine.
That's weird.
It's the ignorance.
Well,
it's,
no,

1519
01:24:58.421 --> 01:25:01.750
it's,
it's,
it's the,
essentially the people that are dictating the rules,

1520
01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:05.830
the people that are writing the laws,
their ignorance about the understanding,

1521
01:25:05.831 --> 01:25:10.330
the effects of on the human body,
these substances out,
if it's done correctly.

1522
01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:14.200
And if it's done through proper medical supervision,
it enhances the body.

1523
01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:18.160
And that's what people don't understand.
When you arrest a guy like still own,

1524
01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:20.230
who's showing up with growth hormone and he's,

1525
01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:24.010
why don't you just let him take his shirt off and look?
Exactly.
The zoo look bad.

1526
01:25:24.011 --> 01:25:27.760
He's healthy.
He's happy.
His wife is good.

1527
01:25:27.761 --> 01:25:29.820
What exactly is going on here?
Yeah.
It's also,

1528
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:33.820
it's not like he's competing in some sport.
We have some unfair advantage.
No,

1529
01:25:33.821 --> 01:25:38.821
he's an old guy who wants to have a body that works good and why is it okay that

1530
01:25:39.901 --> 01:25:43.990
that old guy could go to the bar and just do shot after shot until it's fucking

1531
01:25:43.991 --> 01:25:46.480
liver collapses and no one stops that,

1532
01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:50.710
but you have a problem with them bringing the inboxes of human growth hormone

1533
01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:54.040
just like it's weird.
It is weird.
It's for some reason people,

1534
01:25:55.210 --> 01:25:58.900
when something happens that people decide something is a,

1535
01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:03.860
a law or bad or they've made a decision on something,
it takes forever.
Change it.

1536
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:08.420
<v 4>Like even,
and people are anti science,
right?
They're anti science.</v>

1537
01:26:08.421 --> 01:26:11.150
So this like you'd go,
no,
look these.
This is why this has got no,

1538
01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:14.300
because since the 60s we've said this is bad,
therefore it's bad.

1539
01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:14.681
<v 0>Well,</v>

1540
01:26:14.681 --> 01:26:18.910
I think when it comes to growth hormone and testosterone and all these different

1541
01:26:18.911 --> 01:26:20.680
things were the real,

1542
01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:25.720
where people have an issue is because the way it's played out in the public eye

1543
01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:29.680
has been all about illegal use in sports.

1544
01:26:29.950 --> 01:26:33.670
It's been about the Barry bonds situation.
It's been about Mark McGuire.

1545
01:26:33.671 --> 01:26:37.360
It's been about all these people that are taking these things in cheating in

1546
01:26:37.361 --> 01:26:38.194
sports.

1547
01:26:38.230 --> 01:26:43.230
So because our associations have been all about people getting unfair advantages

1548
01:26:44.531 --> 01:26:48.850
in sports,
people automatically assume that these substances are bad for you.

1549
01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:52.900
When you look at cigarettes,
which are one of the worst things for you ever,

1550
01:26:52.930 --> 01:26:55.810
no one's stopping that from being legal.
Those are everywhere

1551
01:26:55.910 --> 01:27:00.620
<v 4>as people that make hundreds of billions lobby to make that stay leak,
you know,</v>

1552
01:27:00.621 --> 01:27:03.830
like it's like I'm making $100 billion,
I got to get some,

1553
01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:07.730
some government person to say cigarettes is okay,
let's keep that cool.
You know,

1554
01:27:07.731 --> 01:27:10.070
that's,
it's motivated by finance.

1555
01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:13.450
<v 0>Yeah.
But I mean,
I don't,
that's why I don't understand.
I mean,
so it was,</v>

1556
01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:17.050
you could sell testosterone tomb and that can be motivated by finance as well.

1557
01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:20.590
It's just,
there's a big difference between the way people look at,

1558
01:27:20.770 --> 01:27:23.650
there should be a big difference between the way people look at someone who's

1559
01:27:23.651 --> 01:27:26.980
doing something that's a performance enhancing drug that's allowing them to

1560
01:27:26.981 --> 01:27:31.540
compete in an unfair advantage with an unfair advantage in a sport and doing it

1561
01:27:31.541 --> 01:27:33.170
where if you're a guy likes a restaurant Stallone,

1562
01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.220
you're doing it to enhance your life and you're 70 years old or whatever and

1563
01:27:36.221 --> 01:27:39.850
you're shredded.
Like who gives a shit?
Let the guy do whatever he wants.

1564
01:27:39.970 --> 01:27:41.760
<v 4>Well what if,
you know,</v>

1565
01:27:41.770 --> 01:27:46.770
there's an element of trying to let 10 keep a difference between the people at

1566
01:27:47.531 --> 01:27:49.400
the top and the people at the bottom.
What if the,

1567
01:27:49.401 --> 01:27:52.660
all the people at the bottom got testosterone that would be harder to manage

1568
01:27:52.661 --> 01:27:57.490
them harder to kind of,
you know,
like the societal difference between,

1569
01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:58.900
you know,
the oppressed,

1570
01:27:58.930 --> 01:28:01.150
the people who are kind of at the bottom of the food chain.

1571
01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:05.380
The people like the people who run a shit and the kind of people who kind of

1572
01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:09.820
monitor how the world kind of works.
Prefer to keep people watching TV.

1573
01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:14.470
Not really,
you know,
eating bad food that there's does smoking cigarettes.

1574
01:28:14.471 --> 01:28:18.610
There's a direction to keeping some of society not super active and those people

1575
01:28:18.611 --> 01:28:21.100
don't want those people to take performance enhancing drugs.

1576
01:28:21.101 --> 01:28:23.080
They want them to smoke cigarettes and eat hamburgers and shit.

1577
01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:28.240
<v 0>I wonder if that's a real conscious decision.
You know,
there's,
that's a,
that's a,</v>

1578
01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:30.030
a thing that gets thrown around a lot.

1579
01:28:30.031 --> 01:28:32.190
That accusation gets thrown around that there's some sort of uh,

1580
01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:37.290
international cabal.
This look looking out to keep the proletariat down,

1581
01:28:37.330 --> 01:28:37.691
<v 4>but not,</v>

1582
01:28:37.691 --> 01:28:41.560
not so much saying that there's some room somewhere we're 20 guys are in there

1583
01:28:41.561 --> 01:28:44.350
making decisions.
Just the feeling,
the,
the sort of,

1584
01:28:44.590 --> 01:28:48.370
the way that society kind of breaks itself up if these laws happen for this

1585
01:28:48.371 --> 01:28:52.690
reason,
it keeps,
these guys are rich.
The way that society kind of Devy shit out.

1586
01:28:52.810 --> 01:28:54.430
It kind of ends up being that way.

1587
01:28:54.650 --> 01:28:57.860
<v 0>I think you'd kind of ends up being that way more than anybody's trying to make</v>

1588
01:28:57.861 --> 01:28:58.694
it that way.
Yeah.

1589
01:28:58.790 --> 01:29:03.180
I think that what would people have when it comes to testosterone and human

1590
01:29:03.181 --> 01:29:06.790
growth hormone and anti aging and all these,
the stigmas that people have on the,

1591
01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.170
whether that's the efficacy of them or the,

1592
01:29:09.171 --> 01:29:12.450
the dangers of them is a lot of it is based on sports.

1593
01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:15.510
It's a lot of his base on all the negative press that we've heard about guys

1594
01:29:15.511 --> 01:29:18.630
taking steroids in sports.
And then there's,
you know,

1595
01:29:18.631 --> 01:29:22.860
in MMA there's this huge issue with testosterone replacement therapy,

1596
01:29:22.861 --> 01:29:27.040
which was up until very recently legal now,
um,

1597
01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.220
human growth hormone has always been illegal,

1598
01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:32.720
but they were never testing for it until recently when shell son,

1599
01:29:32.721 --> 01:29:35.710
he got popped for human growth hormone.
It was a big deal.
Yeah.

1600
01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:40.020
Because it let everybody know like,
Oh boy,
these new tests,

1601
01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:43.620
like I had a conversation with jail about it right after he got popped.

1602
01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:47.190
He's like,
well,
turns out these new tests are really good.
Yeah.
You know,

1603
01:29:47.191 --> 01:29:48.960
and that's,
that's really what it was.

1604
01:29:48.961 --> 01:29:52.950
They're doing these tasks that costs $45,000 per athlete.
Wow.
Yeah.

1605
01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:56.880
It's all financed by the UFC.
Lorenzo pays for all this shit.
And you know,

1606
01:29:56.881 --> 01:29:57.091
they're,

1607
01:29:57.091 --> 01:30:00.720
they're testing blood or don't and they're doing it and they're doing it.

1608
01:30:00.721 --> 01:30:04.890
They have this like really intense chain of evidence where like the guy will

1609
01:30:04.891 --> 01:30:08.310
show up at your house,
take your blood.
Then it's like,
you know,
fucking suitcase,

1610
01:30:08.311 --> 01:30:10.710
he's got chained to his wrist.
Like it's one of those type of deals.

1611
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:13.680
Like I travels with it to wherever the lab is.
Like it's in his,

1612
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:17.850
his custody the entire time and they take the blood from your body,

1613
01:30:17.851 --> 01:30:21.450
he signs off on it and they bring it to the laboratory and then the laboratory

1614
01:30:21.451 --> 01:30:24.720
analyzes it and you're finding you're there,
there's going to,

1615
01:30:24.730 --> 01:30:26.610
they're going to find out.
A lot of guys are taking,

1616
01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:30.480
<v 3>of course it's,
it's a really interesting one.
This,
it's such a large thing.</v>

1617
01:30:30.481 --> 01:30:33.930
It's like people will try to talk about it in a three minute chunk on TV or

1618
01:30:33.931 --> 01:30:37.800
write one article about it,
but it's,
so,
it's such a large philosophical thing,

1619
01:30:37.801 --> 01:30:38.310
right?

1620
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:42.930
We have to look back at what it means to strive and want to succeed and want to

1621
01:30:42.931 --> 01:30:46.470
Wayne and the desire to be great and all that.
I mean,
shit,

1622
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:51.810
we can go and train at elevation,
which will increase your red blood cell count,

1623
01:30:51.930 --> 01:30:54.540
but you can't take EPL,
which we'll do the same thing,
you know?
Right.
And,

1624
01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:57.120
and for a lot of guys,
just like,
you know,
I want,

1625
01:30:57.150 --> 01:30:59.940
they want to be great and it's like at the low level,

1626
01:30:59.950 --> 01:31:01.950
so the mid levels guys are broke.
They were,
you know,
there,

1627
01:31:02.050 --> 01:31:03.720
maybe it's not as vital,

1628
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:07.830
but at the top of it means five or $10 million in that chasing greatness has

1629
01:31:07.831 --> 01:31:11.010
always been there.
And this doctor's like,
I can help you chase grace greatness.

1630
01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:15.360
That's a naturally instinctively there to go,
well let's explore everything.

1631
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:16.263
Right.

1632
01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:18.690
<v 0>That's where like the ball called God came in.
Yeah,
right.</v>

1633
01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:22.350
You know the Victor Conte guy who came along and came up with some different

1634
01:31:22.351 --> 01:31:24.270
strategies for avoiding tests.

1635
01:31:24.690 --> 01:31:28.830
Some drugs that hadn't been detected yet that they found were effective.

1636
01:31:28.831 --> 01:31:30.240
They sort of manipulated the,
yeah,

1637
01:31:30.410 --> 01:31:33.390
the components of some various performance enhancing drugs.

1638
01:31:33.690 --> 01:31:34.830
And that's where they got that stuff too.

1639
01:31:34.831 --> 01:31:38.220
They called the clear that they were giving allegedly to Barry bonds and a bunch

1640
01:31:38.221 --> 01:31:39.041
of different people.

1641
01:31:39.041 --> 01:31:42.390
And I had content on the podcast and he sort of explained the whole process

1642
01:31:42.391 --> 01:31:44.060
behind all that stuff.
He's is,

1643
01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:48.180
he's a fascinating cat because now he's kind of working hard to stop doping in

1644
01:31:48.181 --> 01:31:51.570
sports,
which is like really a weird position to take.

1645
01:31:51.571 --> 01:31:54.330
When that was your whole career was like juicing guys up.

1646
01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:57.150
I think I saw him on like dateline or something.
Yeah.

1647
01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:00.190
I mean I don't even recently,
I don't know how I feel about that.
It's weird.

1648
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:02.860
<v 5>It's very strange.
But I also don't know how I feel.</v>

1649
01:32:02.890 --> 01:32:06.930
I mean these guys that were on the testosterone,
guys like Vito,

1650
01:32:07.130 --> 01:32:09.330
Vito is the poster boy,
right for Tesco.

1651
01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:12.670
Cause if you've seen the photos of him now,
like pre and post,
man,

1652
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:16.550
it's really crazy.
Yeah.
Pull,
pull his photo of [inaudible] uh,

1653
01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:21.220
pre and post TRT because,
uh,
you know,
he's been saying,

1654
01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:24.540
you know,
I'm not on TRT anymore.
Now it's just tea and t.

1655
01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:27.460
And so then Chris Weidman posts,
hold on.
Is this,

1656
01:32:27.461 --> 01:32:31.900
what happens when you're placed TRT with TNT and he shows a picture of Trt v Two

1657
01:32:31.901 --> 01:32:33.390
r versus the wreath,

1658
01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:37.720
recent veto who's off testosterone and he has shrunken.
Yeah,

1659
01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:41.890
I mean he is really like Luke Rockhold just said that he has a chicken neck now.

1660
01:32:41.891 --> 01:32:43.900
I mean it's,
it's weird that's going to get to him.

1661
01:32:44.110 --> 01:32:48.370
You know what the easiest thing to do to get a a guy in the gym a big like now

1662
01:32:48.371 --> 01:32:52.670
that's a,
that's the wrong photos cause that's a photo of him before testosterone

1663
01:32:52.671 --> 01:32:53.890
replacement and after,

1664
01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:58.980
which you want to see is during and after Chris Weidman comments on Vitor

1665
01:32:59.110 --> 01:33:02.860
Belfort,
TRT and look for a photo.
I'll be like,
well I didn't really need it.

1666
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:05.800
It's like then why were you taking it?
But yeah,
what do you,
how can you say that?

1667
01:33:05.801 --> 01:33:08.380
Yeah,
of course.
And you'll look at them.
But there's,

1668
01:33:08.410 --> 01:33:13.150
there's definitely like all kinds of stuff at play like that will dramatically

1669
01:33:13.151 --> 01:33:16.300
affect his confidence and his confidence.

1670
01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:19.510
How are you throwing SpringAhead kicks AI cause you got this level of
confidence,

1671
01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:20.553
I can do it.

1672
01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:24.130
That's not going to just affect how he looks and when it can do it will affect

1673
01:33:24.131 --> 01:33:25.690
the way he performs without question.

1674
01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:29.950
Shrink that down so we could see the full image.
Yeah.
Wow.
Look at this.

1675
01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:32.530
Look at his body like on the right hand side.

1676
01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:36.220
It looks like he's lost it at least 15 pounds.
Yeah,

1677
01:33:36.221 --> 01:33:40.930
and his neck and the swelling under his channel that's crazies is NAC has
shrunk.

1678
01:33:40.931 --> 01:33:43.840
Really traps.
Look at the difference in the left picture,

1679
01:33:43.841 --> 01:33:47.560
like how high his traps are and the right picture.
It's nuts.

1680
01:33:48.010 --> 01:33:51.910
I mean his body is shrinking,
but it looks so different.

1681
01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:56.740
It a,
it's a strange one too because you go into a gym with bodybuilders,

1682
01:33:57.010 --> 01:34:00.610
you want to get a guy just freaking out.
He's scar.
It looks smaller today.

1683
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:04.780
Told those that shit.
Those guys,
especially guys,

1684
01:34:04.781 --> 01:34:09.100
been walking around in the world with the craziest body that you've ever seen

1685
01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.580
and now people online going,

1686
01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:14.080
he's got a chicken neck that's going to affect his choices from here.

1687
01:34:14.110 --> 01:34:18.440
It's a tough place to be.
Stay offline.
Yeah,
for sure.
For sure.
Yeah.

1688
01:34:18.630 --> 01:34:21.340
He's definitely going to hear about all these things that people are saying

1689
01:34:21.341 --> 01:34:21.731
about them.

1690
01:34:21.731 --> 01:34:24.730
And it's interesting because people are saying like on the underground,

1691
01:34:24.731 --> 01:34:28.510
people are speculating like maybe this is going to make Vituro start using
again.

1692
01:34:28.690 --> 01:34:31.960
And if he does start using again and he's going to Piss hot,
you know?

1693
01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:36.400
And it's all also about like they're testing these guys who's testing them.

1694
01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:39.820
Where are they testing,
how they're being tested.
You know,

1695
01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:43.210
is it going to come down to the UFC,

1696
01:34:43.211 --> 01:34:47.710
has to show up at the gym every day while fighters training and have him peanut

1697
01:34:47.711 --> 01:34:49.270
cup every day.
I mean,

1698
01:34:49.271 --> 01:34:53.770
is that the point is what is the way to tell if a guy's taking anything?

1699
01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:58.070
Because you can,
the problem with urine tests especially,
cause like

1700
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:01.670
<v 0>g guys would joke around about it.
They would say that's not even a drug test.</v>

1701
01:35:01.671 --> 01:35:03.920
It's an intelligence test.
You know that if you,

1702
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:06.050
if you test positive when they're testing your urine,

1703
01:35:06.051 --> 01:35:10.730
you're a fucking idiot because the Ellis stuff like oral testosterone is out of

1704
01:35:10.731 --> 01:35:14.480
your system within 24 hours.
Uh,
human growth hormone is out of your system.

1705
01:35:14.481 --> 01:35:17.570
Within 10 hours.
Like he can't even test,

1706
01:35:17.571 --> 01:35:20.900
I don't think human growth hormone without using blood.

1707
01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:23.040
I don't even think you can test and urine.

1708
01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:25.850
So these guys are getting that we're getting popped.

1709
01:35:25.851 --> 01:35:27.770
They were just doing it completely wrong.

1710
01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:32.270
So now that there's this really stringent testing,
you've got to think,

1711
01:35:32.271 --> 01:35:35.840
well guys are cheating in the Olympics if they're cheating in the Olympics.

1712
01:35:35.841 --> 01:35:37.130
Like how are they getting away with it?

1713
01:35:37.131 --> 01:35:39.230
That's like some of the most stringent testing ever.

1714
01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:42.410
Their tea because they know when they're going to be tested

1715
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:45.290
<v 4>protocol.
Yeah.
A new thing.
It's like,
okay,</v>

1716
01:35:45.291 --> 01:35:48.260
at three o'clock in the morning you set your alarm,
you take this one at three,

1717
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:51.320
you know,
you drink this many liters of something before you do that.
Yeah,

1718
01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:52.400
they'll find a way.

1719
01:35:52.401 --> 01:35:57.401
I mean it's because the game is to try to win then try to win every little

1720
01:35:58.011 --> 01:36:00.530
scenario.
And the doctor who is trying to fix this thing,

1721
01:36:00.531 --> 01:36:01.550
he's got a game to try to,

1722
01:36:01.551 --> 01:36:04.340
when two people are motivated to try to do great things.

1723
01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:08.990
And this doctor's assignment in life,
your assignment in life while you have 20,

1724
01:36:09.190 --> 01:36:12.560
uh,
you know,
you'll make people laugh and call fights and do a million things.

1725
01:36:12.561 --> 01:36:16.760
But,
uh,
his,
his,
his to beat drug tests.
This doctor,

1726
01:36:16.761 --> 01:36:19.710
this one doctor here,
his goal is to go out there.

1727
01:36:19.711 --> 01:36:23.270
I wake up tomorrow and fucking figure out how to win this contest.

1728
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:24.560
I'm beating this test.

1729
01:36:24.690 --> 01:36:25.810
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm,</v>

1730
01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:30.320
I'm really curious to see what's going to happen to these guys that were on

1731
01:36:30.321 --> 01:36:35.060
testosterone replacement and now they're off cause chill son is retired.
He's,

1732
01:36:35.061 --> 01:36:38.060
he's out of the business but [inaudible] still in it.

1733
01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:42.920
And Vito is one of the few guys from 1997 when he made his debut that is at the

1734
01:36:42.921 --> 01:36:47.510
elite level today in 2014 and is ready to fight for a title.

1735
01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:52.340
So it's,
it's really interesting,
really,
really interesting.

1736
01:36:52.410 --> 01:36:54.360
<v 4>But hormones are a weird thing too.
I,
uh,</v>

1737
01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:58.110
my thyroid burned out and I never thought of this until like this.

1738
01:36:58.170 --> 01:37:01.200
It's just how stupid.
Like I grew up by a nuclear power plant,

1739
01:37:01.470 --> 01:37:03.330
like in this town called [inaudible] Manitoba.

1740
01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:06.210
There's like a nuclear research plant there.
And when I was young,

1741
01:37:06.211 --> 01:37:09.750
my mom's thyroid went out.
And then when I was in my thirties,

1742
01:37:09.751 --> 01:37:12.000
mine just ended up dying as tumors in and stuff.

1743
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:15.080
They fixed it up and you'd take a hormone to hormones,
stuff,

1744
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:20.030
take your t three and t four and the other one is um,

1745
01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:24.150
uh,
thyroid,
Tsh,
thyroid stimulating hormone.

1746
01:37:24.151 --> 01:37:27.900
Those three things go out of whack when your thyroid is off,
you feel like shit,

1747
01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:31.500
like you can't function when your hormones go out of whack like that.

1748
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:32.850
So imagine somebody,

1749
01:37:32.851 --> 01:37:35.730
I don't know what it would be like to have your testosterone at that level,

1750
01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:37.740
but it's got to throw you the fuck out of whack.

1751
01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:41.760
<v 0>Yeah.
Well these guys that get off of it,
the thing is when you take testosterone,</v>

1752
01:37:41.770 --> 01:37:44.680
you put this artificial testosterone in your body,

1753
01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:49.150
your body stops producing wrangler,
testosterone.
So if they had low test before,

1754
01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:52.540
it's even lower now because your body stops taking it.

1755
01:37:52.541 --> 01:37:56.370
You're injecting all the stuff in your system.
And you know,
he's only 37

1756
01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:57.370
<v 1>years old.
This is a,</v>

1757
01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:02.520
it's a weird thing to have like old man testosterone levels at 36 37 years old.

1758
01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:06.930
And then to have to face up fucking beast like Chris Weidman,

1759
01:38:07.290 --> 01:38:11.340
knowing that Vitor Belfort,
like when he fought,
um,

1760
01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:15.630
Michael Bisbing when he fought Luke Rockhold,
when he fought Dan Henderson,

1761
01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:16.441
all these guys,

1762
01:38:16.441 --> 01:38:21.441
he was on this artificial stuff and it was making him super confident he'd build

1763
01:38:21.541 --> 01:38:24.390
two strong needs,
was super explosive,

1764
01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:26.820
and now all that's gone and now he's still got tech

1765
01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:30.870
<v 4>need.
Weidman's a on the phone.
He's like,
man,</v>

1766
01:38:30.871 --> 01:38:34.710
you look at that guy,
you look at what,
he's a weird one too.

1767
01:38:34.711 --> 01:38:38.700
Like you don't even look at him and think he's just a modern amalgamation.

1768
01:38:38.701 --> 01:38:41.910
He's just genetically better than us.
He's more handsome than us.

1769
01:38:41.911 --> 01:38:44.100
He's funnier than us,
more confident than I,

1770
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:48.630
he's genetically better than 97 99% of all men on earth.

1771
01:38:49.050 --> 01:38:54.050
And he learns fast and he's incredibly driven and he grew up wrestling and just

1772
01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:56.130
for the thing about wrestlers,

1773
01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:58.770
they just spend their whole time dominating other men.

1774
01:38:58.950 --> 01:39:02.220
That's all they're about growing up.
They dominate other men physically.

1775
01:39:02.250 --> 01:39:05.220
That's who that guy grew up with.
Dan.
He learns while it got the best coaches,

1776
01:39:05.221 --> 01:39:08.730
everyone believes in him like a guy like that.
Uh,
we called it,

1777
01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:09.900
he was going to beat Anderson Silva.

1778
01:39:09.901 --> 01:39:11.790
He was in our studio and we're talking to them.

1779
01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:16.770
And you talked to this guy in advance and he fucking believe without a shadow of

1780
01:39:16.771 --> 01:39:19.620
a doubt,
he was gonna beat him.
Even turned down.
Remember this,

1781
01:39:19.621 --> 01:39:22.050
he turned down his contract renewal and said,
no,

1782
01:39:22.051 --> 01:39:23.850
I'll beat him and then I'll sign my new contract.

1783
01:39:23.970 --> 01:39:27.210
I know I'll have to beat him twice.
Everything he said came true.

1784
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:30.030
Everything that's animal.
Yeah,
that's crazy.

1785
01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:32.600
<v 1>And he did it all.
Was knees all fucked up.
You know,</v>

1786
01:39:32.601 --> 01:39:36.260
a lot of people don't know he did.
He couldn't even bring his heel up to his ass,

1787
01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.450
like his knees were so arthritic.

1788
01:39:38.630 --> 01:39:41.270
And then he went and got that Regena keen done in Germany.

1789
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:43.220
And then after he had that done,

1790
01:39:43.221 --> 01:39:47.870
he still had to get his knee scoped but against Leono his knees were great and

1791
01:39:47.871 --> 01:39:51.710
now he's throwing kicks at him and shit and it's,
he's,
he's a different animal.

1792
01:39:51.770 --> 01:39:55.430
Yes.
He's an unusual dude.
He can take it too.

1793
01:39:55.431 --> 01:39:59.240
That's the other thing about why men like Leono unloaded on him in the fifth

1794
01:39:59.241 --> 01:40:02.870
round and it was still there kind of asking from one.
Yeah,
fourth and fifth round

1795
01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:03.990
<v 4>when he was at fight,</v>

1796
01:40:03.991 --> 01:40:07.080
now our can't a couple hours to kill to like what to the airport and he was

1797
01:40:07.081 --> 01:40:11.760
hanging out and Ram Dean started playing him in Ping Pong and ram was getting a

1798
01:40:11.761 --> 01:40:15.810
little slight better of him.
He fucking got dead serious.
I want a better paddle.

1799
01:40:15.811 --> 01:40:19.110
I'm not fucking around here.
Dead serious.
And he's like,
I don't like to lose.

1800
01:40:19.111 --> 01:40:21.960
He's pasted,
still have it fine.
It's still a good slug.
We're having a great time.

1801
01:40:21.961 --> 01:40:24.750
But he did not want to lose that game.

1802
01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:27.720
It was not in him to let this guy beat him in ping pong.

1803
01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:31.440
He's not a ping pong guy.
He just is not having it.
It just not having it.

1804
01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.940
<v 1>There's a lot of guys like that.</v>

1805
01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:37.050
I played Jake Ellenberger pool once and Ellenberger who a fucking stud.

1806
01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:41.100
He's not very good at pool and I've been playing pool a long time and he's

1807
01:40:41.101 --> 01:40:43.700
fucking,
every time I was winning,
he's like,
yeah,
sure.

1808
01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:47.640
Like you could see like he was handling it,
but he didn't like it.
Yeah,

1809
01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:51.240
but that's the quality that makes them great fighters,

1810
01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:54.040
that unwillingness to lose.
You

1811
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.280
<v 0>know,
the guy wants to fight you.
If you fuck a beat him at pinball,</v>

1812
01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:01.870
you know like that.
That's that quality that makes them a great fighter.

1813
01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:03.053
Heating.
Losing,
yeah.

1814
01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:06.920
<v 4>Yeah.
Once you're getting at this point where these guys are the top top guys,</v>

1815
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:09.410
they have to have all of it.
They have to have that quality.

1816
01:41:09.411 --> 01:41:11.360
They have to have that genetic Steph to have those coaches.

1817
01:41:11.361 --> 01:41:13.970
They have to have that mental game or else this just no way.

1818
01:41:13.971 --> 01:41:17.990
That's how good the whole level is now.
It's still getting better.
It's shocking.

1819
01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:23.260
Ellenberger had that fight with Rory and he's never been a ship talker and all

1820
01:41:23.571 --> 01:41:26.510
of a sudden he was talking to walk.
Oh,
all kinds of shit on Twitter and stuff,

1821
01:41:26.930 --> 01:41:28.340
and when he got in there,

1822
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:32.000
it raised that pressure so high that you know,

1823
01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:35.690
it wasn't that I like,
I got to beat this guy who was,

1824
01:41:35.691 --> 01:41:37.260
I just can't lose bad to a guy.

1825
01:41:37.261 --> 01:41:40.160
I called a fruit stick on an inch and a half and the pressure of it.

1826
01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:43.370
That's why when people were so excited about Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier,

1827
01:41:43.371 --> 01:41:46.370
I'm like this kind of,
although it's great,
I love that people are into a fight.

1828
01:41:46.371 --> 01:41:47.330
I love like that.

1829
01:41:47.331 --> 01:41:49.910
There'll be about a million more people that normally watching a fight.

1830
01:41:49.911 --> 01:41:52.520
That's a love that,
that's awesome.
But for me personally,

1831
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:54.020
I just want to see them fight.

1832
01:41:54.050 --> 01:41:56.410
They're going to fight whether they hate each other or not,
right.

1833
01:41:56.420 --> 01:41:57.650
They're going to go in there.

1834
01:41:57.651 --> 01:42:00.950
We're going to see 25 minutes or less of these two guys putting together their

1835
01:42:00.951 --> 01:42:02.390
lifetime of everything to fight.

1836
01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:05.630
Whether or not that guy hates that guy isn't really all that relevant to me.

1837
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:08.700
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
I agree with you.
Um,</v>

1838
01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:11.290
I was torn on that whole thing because I'm,

1839
01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:14.750
part of me loves the fact they're fucking with each other and yeah,

1840
01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:18.050
getting into each other's heads.
But I think that it does,

1841
01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:22.010
it's not a good representation of mixed martial arts to see two guys who are at

1842
01:42:22.011 --> 01:42:23.500
the elite level have a street fight.
Like

1843
01:42:23.650 --> 01:42:27.570
<v 4>I hated that.
I loved when they were talking with no on.
Yeah.
Cause that was real.</v>

1844
01:42:27.690 --> 01:42:30.680
<v 0>That was funny.
When John Jones puts the microwave goes,
hey pussy,</v>

1845
01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:35.480
<v 4>that's amazing.
Him and then I would kill you.</v>

1846
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:39.200
I would tell you it was literally kill you.
Literally kill you,
John.
You take,

1847
01:42:39.201 --> 01:42:43.520
I would just let you kill me.
Yeah.
Come on data.
You can do better.
I'm a big car.

1848
01:42:43.521 --> 01:42:46.400
Me a guy,
man.
I know,
although John John is absolutely bright,

1849
01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:49.470
but when they fought each other on a stage,
I hated that stupid,

1850
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.020
like two of the best athletes in the world and that's the worst fight I've ever

1851
01:42:54.021 --> 01:42:56.750
seen.
I don't want no part of that is bad.
People are going,
Oh,

1852
01:42:56.751 --> 01:42:59.420
you watch that show or you work in that business like in these idiots.

1853
01:42:59.421 --> 01:43:02.870
That's terrible.
But when they were talking about each other with a camera on,

1854
01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:07.640
that's real and there's so little real in the world,
you fucking win some some,

1855
01:43:07.641 --> 01:43:08.120
uh,

1856
01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:12.320
like hip hop award and you've got to thank God and you're fucking producer and

1857
01:43:12.321 --> 01:43:15.410
you're,
and you know,
I just feel so blessed and I want to thank the fans.

1858
01:43:15.411 --> 01:43:18.650
It's like fucking bullshit.
Let me see what you say when there's,

1859
01:43:18.651 --> 01:43:19.800
when there's not everybody.

1860
01:43:20.130 --> 01:43:23.630
<v 0>Yeah.
That's the thing about that getting John and Daniel.
Well,</v>

1861
01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:27.120
apparently that video was pulled.
Yeah,
it was more

1862
01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:31.020
<v 4>apparently when they said,
guys,
you're a on the Internet.
I think again,</v>

1863
01:43:31.021 --> 01:43:34.330
it's Melcher might have that,
hey guys,
uh,
you know,
you're being shot.

1864
01:43:34.350 --> 01:43:38.790
This could be around the world.
And,
and Jones,
his face just went like,

1865
01:43:38.970 --> 01:43:43.320
Holy Shit.
He,
like,
he realized,
you know,

1866
01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:45.150
that that was the,
that's the best part.

1867
01:43:45.151 --> 01:43:46.800
I don't know why that part doesn't get shared.

1868
01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:52.130
<v 0>You know,
everybody's trying to put up an like John's,</v>

1869
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:55.080
<v 1>his depiction of what happened when he first met Danielle.</v>

1870
01:43:55.081 --> 01:43:56.990
I was just trying to make a new friend,
like what

1871
01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:02.310
<v 4>they call them,
all the exact same story.
All the,
he said he did,
I did this,
this,</v>

1872
01:44:02.311 --> 01:44:06.150
this,
he did that.
This happened.
He was a dick and I got,
yeah,
I did this,
this,

1873
01:44:06.151 --> 01:44:08.430
this happened in the bar.
I was just fucking around.
But it's,

1874
01:44:08.431 --> 01:44:09.750
they tell the exact same story.

1875
01:44:09.850 --> 01:44:12.040
<v 1>Well Dan,
well he wasn't even saying he was fucking around.
He was like,</v>

1876
01:44:12.041 --> 01:44:13.810
I was just trying to form a new friendship.

1877
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:18.370
Like fuck you where you're trying to let some duties and your division know that

1878
01:44:18.371 --> 01:44:21.360
you're the fucking king.
Yeah.
He ain't taking me down.
You know,

1879
01:44:21.361 --> 01:44:24.190
it was like trying to let them know is trying to fuck with his head and let the

1880
01:44:24.191 --> 01:44:25.570
gamesmanship begin.
Yeah.

1881
01:44:25.690 --> 01:44:29.860
<v 4>And that,
that stuff is a definitely a law.
That's all interesting.</v>

1882
01:44:29.861 --> 01:44:30.940
Cause that's all real too.

1883
01:44:31.090 --> 01:44:34.060
That's all having a real effect on the outcome of a fight.

1884
01:44:34.330 --> 01:44:38.650
All of that mental stuff.
Uh,
you know,
the guys at the weigh ins,
how they act.

1885
01:44:38.651 --> 01:44:42.790
I mean,
you've seen the science where they looked at the smiles and the wins.
No,

1886
01:44:43.130 --> 01:44:46.940
no science to this guy.
So check that out on the Internet.
These,

1887
01:44:46.941 --> 01:44:47.980
because these researchers,

1888
01:44:48.010 --> 01:44:52.900
these sociologists go and they looked at hundreds or thousands of UFC way ants

1889
01:44:52.901 --> 01:44:55.300
and they found that guys who smiled lost,
uh,

1890
01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:59.590
an extremely large percentage of them.
Real.
Yeah.
For Real,
for real.

1891
01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:00.693
And uh,

1892
01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:05.080
because that moment is a moment of the starting of the conflict between the two

1893
01:45:05.081 --> 01:45:08.590
males,
between the two alpha males.
It doesn't start when the cage car starts.

1894
01:45:08.830 --> 01:45:12.200
It starts when we're setting the tone of who's who in there.
And when the,

1895
01:45:12.201 --> 01:45:13.930
the smile is a giveaway of a circuit.

1896
01:45:13.931 --> 01:45:16.090
There's two kinds of small ones called the chess share smile.

1897
01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:18.250
And neither is the smile of I'm going to fucking kill you.

1898
01:45:18.490 --> 01:45:22.300
And that one doesn't count.
They look at the actual types of smiles.
It's real.

1899
01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:24.430
It's,
it's fascinating how one doesn't count.
No,

1900
01:45:24.431 --> 01:45:26.560
because it's a different expression there.
You know,

1901
01:45:26.561 --> 01:45:30.040
you can look at the slivers of expression and in um,

1902
01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:34.060
in psychology and what they mean and that one means something different.

1903
01:45:34.530 --> 01:45:38.610
<v 1>Isn't that fascinating that the difference in like understanding facial</v>

1904
01:45:38.611 --> 01:45:42.570
expressions like human beings kind of get when someone's creepy,

1905
01:45:42.810 --> 01:45:46.710
but like would a robot be able to figure that out?
You know,
study financially,

1906
01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:50.670
filing fighters are losing fighters,
but that's not always true.

1907
01:45:50.671 --> 01:45:54.060
John Dodson smiles every fight.
That's not a good example.
No,

1908
01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:56.130
just smiled before he fucks people up

1909
01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:59.660
<v 4>to the math.
You look at the math and it's like whatever the numbers are,
he may,</v>

1910
01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:03.080
there are exceptions,
you know,
they might lose whatever 68% of the time.

1911
01:46:03.081 --> 01:46:05.840
We're 63 that's higher than the 50 that you would think,

1912
01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:10.130
but that still means there's 32% of other guys who smile and kick ass.

1913
01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:13.370
It just shows that there is a sway,
you know,

1914
01:46:13.371 --> 01:46:15.650
in the statistical truth of that.

1915
01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:18.380
<v 1>Hang.
That's funny.
Donald Cerrone and Anthony Pettis.</v>

1916
01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:22.110
<v 4>Actually I did a breakout send it to you of um,
of uh,</v>

1917
01:46:22.170 --> 01:46:25.610
what the impression of Alpha male posturing the PR,

1918
01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:28.260
the effect that that has on fighting.
So you know,

1919
01:46:28.261 --> 01:46:31.290
like guys will stand there and they'll have a project,
a certain posture.

1920
01:46:31.291 --> 01:46:34.290
There was research done at the University of Harvard,

1921
01:46:34.291 --> 01:46:36.900
Harvard University about Alpha posture.

1922
01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:40.290
And what happens if you're interviewing me for a job and I have a certain

1923
01:46:40.291 --> 01:46:42.420
posture and they interviewed,
they talked to you after.

1924
01:46:42.510 --> 01:46:47.280
You'll score me much higher of your opinion of me also.
Yeah.

1925
01:46:47.310 --> 01:46:50.070
And that affects your,
when we go to fight

1926
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:54.900
<v 3>and I like Uriah Faber has that a lot and he projects a certain thing and that</v>

1927
01:46:54.901 --> 01:46:56.400
will affect your performance.
But the mat,

1928
01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:59.760
this science actually shows that it affects his performance as well.

1929
01:46:59.761 --> 01:47:01.710
Cause there's certain postures that when you do them,

1930
01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:05.790
your testosterone rate raises a measurable amount and your cortisol drops a

1931
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:10.580
measurable amount just by doing a certain physical posture.
Yeah,
it's real man

1932
01:47:14.330 --> 01:47:17.720
on therapy.
Why don't guys just postural day?

1933
01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:22.350
Some guys do that really work well.
It's,
there's a few of them in a big one.

1934
01:47:22.351 --> 01:47:25.880
So let me tell VTR.
Yeah,
exactly.
[inaudible] that shit all the way

1935
01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:31.060
traps.
It's a Harvard research anyways.
And uh,
they,

1936
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:34.050
they did it to measure your pro,

1937
01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:38.310
your biological responses to your own physical posture.
But it also,

1938
01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:40.290
there's an interpretation of the other guy.

1939
01:47:40.410 --> 01:47:43.770
So I broke that down and then I took a piece of Donald's Serone standing there

1940
01:47:43.771 --> 01:47:47.820
looking over at Pedis and then I've superimposed with Serone set after,

1941
01:47:47.821 --> 01:47:51.690
and he said,
I looked across the cage at him and I looked at him,
I thought,
Dang,

1942
01:47:51.691 --> 01:47:53.340
I pissed him off.
And he's coming hard.

1943
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:56.090
And it was the worst performance he's ever had.
And he talks over me.

1944
01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:57.960
Serone is fascinating cause thrown.

1945
01:47:57.980 --> 01:48:02.580
He's a regular guy who deals with fear and uses it appropriately.

1946
01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:05.880
And he talked about looking over and he literally said,
I saw that guy.

1947
01:48:05.881 --> 01:48:08.430
And he said,
after I knew I had to see us,
a psychiatrist,

1948
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:12.330
like a sports psychologist or a psychologist because there's no way I should be

1949
01:48:12.331 --> 01:48:15.330
about to fight a guy.
And the things going through my mind is all man,

1950
01:48:15.331 --> 01:48:17.160
I pissed him off.
Never should happen.

1951
01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:21.030
But it was po in part the posture of of um,

1952
01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:24.300
pedis that projected that on them.
But that's an interesting,
yeah.

1953
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:28.590
All each of these guys who wear red when a slight percentage larger all of a

1954
01:48:28.591 --> 01:48:29.970
sudden GSPS wearing red every time.

1955
01:48:30.330 --> 01:48:34.890
Cause guys are looking for one and 2% incremental raises and there are certain

1956
01:48:34.891 --> 01:48:37.890
guys anyways,
why is red make you win?
I don't know,

1957
01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:41.910
but I mean Mike Tyson always wore black.
Yeah.
Well Mike Tyson was my exercise.

1958
01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:45.840
Go to one pink.
Yeah.
Fuck.
That's okay.

1959
01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:49.490
It's probably something that you see in the wild when you see,
you know,

1960
01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.960
a certain color in nature and it has an effect on you each.
Yeah.

1961
01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:57.060
Each of these things might be one or 2% in the end.

1962
01:48:57.061 --> 01:48:59.570
If you can't fucking fight it doesn't matter.
Right.
You know,

1963
01:48:59.571 --> 01:49:01.080
like have the physical skills,

1964
01:49:01.081 --> 01:49:04.290
you have the technique and then you add on those other things.
Yeah.

1965
01:49:04.291 --> 01:49:07.260
I imagine you both guys at the top level have all that.

1966
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:09.720
They're both have the best strength and conditioning on earth.

1967
01:49:09.870 --> 01:49:12.900
They both have the entire human history of fighting skills.

1968
01:49:13.050 --> 01:49:16.320
They both have all the mental training.
They have all that shit.
Shit,
man,

1969
01:49:16.321 --> 01:49:19.800
if I could get half a percentage of increase on my side in any way,

1970
01:49:19.801 --> 01:49:21.930
let's stack up two or three of those have percentages.

1971
01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:26.610
I wonder what the red thing is.
That's enough.
It's true in all sports,

1972
01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:31.140
uh,
sports teams that were red have won a slightly larger percentage of time than

1973
01:49:31.141 --> 01:49:34.360
any other color.
Real.
Yeah.
Wow.

1974
01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:38.220
I'm having,
this is the kind of shit that fascinates,
you know,

1975
01:49:38.221 --> 01:49:41.830
they also see the like red sports cars get pulled over more.
Yeah.

1976
01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:43.650
So it's something in nature.

1977
01:49:43.651 --> 01:49:47.920
It's something that we probably had to deal with as a threat.
Evolutionary

1978
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:52.270
<v 0>red is a threatening thing.
Like if you see an animal that's red,
like a snake,</v>

1979
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:56.260
it's red.
You assume that that's a snake that could poison you.
Yeah.
You know,

1980
01:49:56.261 --> 01:49:59.510
but like animals,
there's no red predators are there are,

1981
01:50:00.370 --> 01:50:04.210
there might've been certain thousands of years ago or some shit.
Yeah.

1982
01:50:04.490 --> 01:50:06.760
Send some wine.
Red is a winning color.
Yeah.

1983
01:50:07.530 --> 01:50:09.690
<v 4>And saw that just start stacking up all these sites.</v>

1984
01:50:09.730 --> 01:50:13.830
So now I've got years worth of fucking breakdowns I can do just from all these

1985
01:50:13.831 --> 01:50:17.670
things to reading and looking.
And it's like you start to combine them,
you know,

1986
01:50:17.671 --> 01:50:21.360
you've got the and the evolutionary hat and you got the job and you got red

1987
01:50:21.361 --> 01:50:23.760
winning,
you've got Alpha posture,
you put all that shit together.

1988
01:50:23.761 --> 01:50:26.580
What the fuck does that mean?
Right.
That's what I'm doing with my life.

1989
01:50:27.190 --> 01:50:28.660
<v 0>That's interesting.
You know,</v>

1990
01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:32.680
I also am fascinated and I want to bring this back to you.

1991
01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:34.720
I'm competing at such a lightweight,

1992
01:50:34.930 --> 01:50:38.560
I'm fascinating by the science of weight cutting and the negative aspects of

1993
01:50:38.561 --> 01:50:42.250
weight cutting.
This is an important part of MMA.
And uh,

1994
01:50:42.251 --> 01:50:45.550
one of the best examples in my opinion is Anthony Rumble Johnson.

1995
01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:48.730
Anthony Rumble Johnson who fought at one 74.

1996
01:50:48.731 --> 01:50:51.840
The majority of the first stint of his UFC career,
uh,

1997
01:50:51.850 --> 01:50:54.910
fought one fight at one 85 with Vito Belfort actually didn't even make the

1998
01:50:54.911 --> 01:50:55.990
weight,
was overweight,

1999
01:50:55.991 --> 01:50:59.830
got cuts from the UFC and then started fighting heavyweight fucked up.

2000
01:50:59.831 --> 01:51:04.480
Andrew Polaski as a heavyweight was destroying guys in the first round,

2001
01:51:04.481 --> 01:51:05.740
almost stopped him.
Really.

2002
01:51:05.741 --> 01:51:10.741
Probably they should have stopped that fight and then have fought in the UFC as

2003
01:51:11.051 --> 01:51:15.600
a light heavyweight.
Two fights in a row.
It's just been a murderer.

2004
01:51:15.610 --> 01:51:18.810
This is a world class dude.
Couldn't take full day.

2005
01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:21.670
Full Day was couldn't take them down and just got battered on the feet and then

2006
01:51:21.671 --> 01:51:24.040
destroyed little nog in the first round.

2007
01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:27.520
40 seconds of the first round just lit him up like a Christmas tree and it looks

2008
01:51:27.521 --> 01:51:29.980
like the scariest guy in the world at 205 pounds.

2009
01:51:30.190 --> 01:51:35.140
When his first career was 35 pounds lighter than that.

2010
01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:36.580
That's crazy.

2011
01:51:36.630 --> 01:51:39.120
<v 4>I've never seen him in Ohio.
And I was sitting in the stands.</v>

2012
01:51:39.121 --> 01:51:44.121
It was rap page versus Keith Jardeen and I was sitting in the stands and

2013
01:51:44.521 --> 01:51:48.840
there's,
he's pretty good the size of him.
Yeah.
What the fuck is that?

2014
01:51:48.841 --> 01:51:53.310
He is amazing.
What fight is that?
Staples Center?
It's probably a,

2015
01:51:54.730 --> 01:51:58.810
<v 0>was that Phil Davis?
No,
it's Anthony.
John Noah.</v>

2016
01:51:59.150 --> 01:52:03.570
Sam.
That might've been him when he fought at one 70 which is ridiculous.
Right.

2017
01:52:03.571 --> 01:52:03.980
Crazy.

2018
01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:08.360
<v 4>But I saw him and there was these hot girls and like eight UFC fighters walked</v>

2019
01:52:08.361 --> 01:52:11.840
over.
I'll,
hi,
great to see Ya.
And I was like,
oh,
okay.
Those are the Ohio checks.

2020
01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:14.510
And Anthony walks over just to say hello.

2021
01:52:14.511 --> 01:52:16.840
I don't know how they might've fucking had a real job.
I Dunno.

2022
01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:20.050
I'm projected that on him cause they were pretty,
uh,
and he goes over it.

2023
01:52:21.010 --> 01:52:25.610
I turned to my buddy and I'm like,
that huge guy.

2024
01:52:25.611 --> 01:52:30.050
The fucking enormous guy looks a lot like Anthony Johnson and it was Anthony

2025
01:52:30.050 --> 01:52:34.250
Johnson now like 240 pounds it when he was a one 70.
Yeah.
So,
but yeah,

2026
01:52:34.251 --> 01:52:36.500
I mean the weight cutting thing,
I don't know how he did that.

2027
01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:38.870
He almost killed himself probably doing it.

2028
01:52:38.871 --> 01:52:42.680
And I mean if we're talking about measuring things that really work,

2029
01:52:42.681 --> 01:52:46.760
looking at the math of like,
is this better?
This,
okay,
great.

2030
01:52:46.761 --> 01:52:49.670
Your eight pounds heavier than the other guy that raises your,

2031
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:53.460
let's say what you're,
if we're going to score your likelihood of winning a race,

2032
01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:58.470
is it 6% but the point of diminishing returns and what if it drops you 8%

2033
01:52:58.611 --> 01:53:01.220
because of the weight cut and stuff.
It's true for me.

2034
01:53:01.221 --> 01:53:04.370
I mean all of this was a learning experience so I can be a real analyst.

2035
01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:05.390
That's what I want it to do it.

2036
01:53:05.391 --> 01:53:08.960
So we'll cutting weight was an experience that I really needed to have and

2037
01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:12.280
understand it,
but it just,
wrestlers data,

2038
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:14.900
they were good at restaurants were beaten everybody and they were bigger and

2039
01:53:14.901 --> 01:53:17.210
everyone else was like,
we gotta do this.
And I think you're right.
I,

2040
01:53:17.211 --> 01:53:20.780
I think you're absolutely right.
Well you got to see guys got away from it.

2041
01:53:20.781 --> 01:53:22.610
Eventually get away from that huge weight cut.

2042
01:53:23.570 --> 01:53:25.370
<v 0>Zidan cut weight at all.
I mean,</v>

2043
01:53:25.371 --> 01:53:29.000
I really wish they fought at no and everyone made an agreement to fight it.

2044
01:53:29.001 --> 01:53:32.150
What you way,
you know,
but everybody wants this advantage.

2045
01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:35.520
But the problem was when both guys are seeking and advantage and they both try

2046
01:53:35.521 --> 01:53:39.280
to achieve that advantage while you're actually wind up happening is it's okay.

2047
01:53:39.310 --> 01:53:40.370
Just got it.
Will you,

2048
01:53:40.371 --> 01:53:45.371
will you actually wind up happening is you have both guys that are fighting not

2049
01:53:45.561 --> 01:53:49.670
to the best extent of their abilities and so instead neither guy has an

2050
01:53:49.671 --> 01:53:52.790
advantage in both guys are compromised.
Yeah,
I agree.
Yeah,

2051
01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:56.030
and it's also dangerous when it comes to combat sports,
a difference,

2052
01:53:56.031 --> 01:53:58.850
true wrestling,
which is a combat sport,

2053
01:53:58.851 --> 01:54:03.560
but it's not a contact sport in terms of concussive blows where you're dealing

2054
01:54:03.561 --> 01:54:04.341
with striking.

2055
01:54:04.341 --> 01:54:09.341
There's a big difference almost all of the instances of a of brain damage and

2056
01:54:09.381 --> 01:54:13.700
death that occurred in boxing because boxing matches or a lighter weight fights,

2057
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:17.720
not brain damaged.
Cumulative to heavyweight guys of course,
got that as well,

2058
01:54:17.721 --> 01:54:22.580
but in fights where guys like had bleeding on the brain and then were w and then

2059
01:54:22.581 --> 01:54:25.010
wound up dying,
almost all of them.

2060
01:54:25.130 --> 01:54:28.130
There was one recent one that was a heavyweight bound with Eric Perez,

2061
01:54:28.250 --> 01:54:31.760
fought a Russian guy and the guy had some swelling of the brain and his careers

2062
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:36.140
probably over that was a prolonged beating,
unusual situation.

2063
01:54:36.530 --> 01:54:38.330
Whereas like boom,
boom,

2064
01:54:38.331 --> 01:54:43.100
[inaudible] and duck who cam that was a severe weight cut.
Um,
Gerald Mcclellan,

2065
01:54:43.101 --> 01:54:44.150
severe weight cut.

2066
01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:48.680
A lot of fighters who wound up having like horrible tragedies inside the ring.

2067
01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:51.090
It was because they had depleted themselves,

2068
01:54:51.091 --> 01:54:53.030
did dehydrated themselves and then they got it

2069
01:54:53.070 --> 01:54:56.700
<v 4>beat up.
Yeah.
If there's gotta be a death and you know,</v>

2070
01:54:56.701 --> 01:54:59.010
a high level MMA one day and,
and you'd have,

2071
01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:02.250
you would gas that if there was dehydration and the brain that would add to it

2072
01:55:02.251 --> 01:55:06.270
for sure.
Well the guy died in Brazil from cutting weight.
Yeah,
yeah.
Right,
right.

2073
01:55:06.271 --> 01:55:08.510
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's true.
It was liver or kidney.

2074
01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:10.033
<v 0>Can you fill?
Yeah.</v>

2075
01:55:10.210 --> 01:55:13.150
Which almost happened to Daniel Cormier when he competed in the Olympics.

2076
01:55:13.151 --> 01:55:15.480
He had kidney failure and they pulled them out of the Olympic.

2077
01:55:15.710 --> 01:55:17.880
<v 4>Yeah.
W and that big weight cut that guys do,</v>

2078
01:55:17.881 --> 01:55:22.881
one of the tools they use is some hyperhydration where you use like a ton of

2079
01:55:23.341 --> 01:55:26.270
distilled water to flush all your sodium,
but it also has like a,

2080
01:55:26.490 --> 01:55:30.750
like a kidney trick where it's actually doing tricking your kidney to perform a

2081
01:55:30.751 --> 01:55:34.440
certain way.
It's really risky.
Yeah.
I think in the long run,

2082
01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:36.840
if everybody just said,
yeah,
let's just fight at arrest.
Uh,

2083
01:55:36.890 --> 01:55:41.890
Sam Stout and Kj noons had a fight up in Quebec city and they just like two days

2084
01:55:42.241 --> 01:55:43.770
out,
they're like,
oh,
how much weigh and man,

2085
01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:45.720
I'm weighing about one 71 what about you?

2086
01:55:45.870 --> 01:55:49.370
Like one 70 you want to just fight at one 70 and they just did it.
Yeah,

2087
01:55:49.371 --> 01:55:53.940
that's smart.
Yeah.
Smart.
I mean,
why torture yourself?
Especially at both doing it.

2088
01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:55.330
It just doesn't make

2089
01:55:55.330 --> 01:55:55.860
<v 0>sense.</v>

2090
01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:59.760
If you both walking around on one 85 and you're both cutting down to one 75 one

2091
01:55:59.761 --> 01:56:02.280
85,
you know,
you're probably both fight better.

2092
01:56:02.650 --> 01:56:05.070
<v 4>The trick is that everything's that arms race.</v>

2093
01:56:05.071 --> 01:56:08.310
We were talking about ever everything is somebody looking for an advantage to

2094
01:56:08.311 --> 01:56:09.990
win.
So we agreed to do it,

2095
01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:13.620
but then I'm lying and I actually cut 15 pounds and now I'm way bigger than you.

2096
01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:14.770
You know what I mean?
That it,

2097
01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:19.020
until you find a way to make it have to happen or make something that both guys

2098
01:56:19.021 --> 01:56:21.720
adhere to for some reason that's safe.
And this is,

2099
01:56:21.810 --> 01:56:23.220
this is the way they're going to do it.

2100
01:56:23.290 --> 01:56:24.190
<v 0>Yeah.
It's interesting.</v>

2101
01:56:24.191 --> 01:56:28.300
Like Bj Penn has a weird way of looking at things because a Bj,

2102
01:56:28.750 --> 01:56:32.560
although he dropped down to 145 pounds when he fought Frankie Edgar and his last

2103
01:56:32.561 --> 01:56:36.070
fight who would not ivy.
Yeah.
And you know,

2104
01:56:36.071 --> 01:56:38.650
and dolce tried to get them to ivy.
He wouldn't do it.

2105
01:56:38.651 --> 01:56:43.330
He feels like Ivs are cheating and Antal here.
Yeah,
the Ivy's cheating.

2106
01:56:43.331 --> 01:56:47.010
But,
but cutting,
weight's not cheating.
It's weird.

2107
01:56:47.011 --> 01:56:48.940
So like dehydrating yourself,

2108
01:56:48.941 --> 01:56:52.840
getting on a scale of one 45 and then drinking water's okay.
But yeah,

2109
01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:55.390
<v 4>but putting it into you at different route is not okay.</v>

2110
01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:58.320
<v 0>Yeah.
There's something about like needles.
It's not natural.</v>

2111
01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:02.160
<v 4>Yes.
The whole idea.
I think most cats wouldn't agree.
He is a unique one now,
man.</v>

2112
01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:07.320
But a lot of debate over at our office with a few friends and stuff about his

2113
01:57:07.471 --> 01:57:09.240
place in the world personally.

2114
01:57:09.241 --> 01:57:12.570
Like I think Bj Penn's one of the greats ever for a million reasons.

2115
01:57:12.571 --> 01:57:15.750
And other guy,
like certain people will say,
well,

2116
01:57:15.751 --> 01:57:19.860
his records has this or he never beat,
you know,
there's reasons to that.

2117
01:57:19.861 --> 01:57:23.850
People argue it.
But I think the biggest thing is pure talent.

2118
01:57:24.030 --> 01:57:25.920
And one thing I think people sort of forget.

2119
01:57:25.950 --> 01:57:30.030
You see a guy and you go to a guy's back and you trap his arm in there with the

2120
01:57:30.031 --> 01:57:31.650
hook.
That's a Bj Penn.

2121
01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:35.520
You take a guy on the fence and you turn your body sideways and you elbow him

2122
01:57:35.521 --> 01:57:37.710
when you're defending the single.
That's a Bj Penn.

2123
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:41.820
Did we really see that at all before he fought Diego Sanchez?
You know when you,

2124
01:57:41.821 --> 01:57:43.440
when you got a guy in a triangle,

2125
01:57:43.441 --> 01:57:47.310
but he hides his arm over here and you pressure the straight armbar against your

2126
01:57:47.311 --> 01:57:49.410
face until he gives you the triangle.
That's a beachae pen.

2127
01:57:49.530 --> 01:57:53.640
There's all of these things that he did that you know,
and uh,

2128
01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:57.300
and he can,
I don't know.
It's a weird one.
I mean the very least,

2129
01:57:57.301 --> 01:57:59.760
he should be considered one of the most beloved fighters of all time.

2130
01:57:59.790 --> 01:58:03.600
<v 0>Well,
he's a great fighter for sure.
And he's a two division champion.</v>

2131
01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:06.900
He's without a doubt.
He's an all time great.
Um,

2132
01:58:07.470 --> 01:58:12.470
what I think about Bj is that Bj at his very best was outside of his comfort

2133
01:58:13.561 --> 01:58:14.010
zone.

2134
01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:17.370
He brought in Marinovich to do strength conditioning and he just got in this

2135
01:58:17.371 --> 01:58:20.790
unbelievable condition and when he fought Diego Sanchez,

2136
01:58:20.791 --> 01:58:21.990
he was probably at his best.

2137
01:58:21.991 --> 01:58:24.840
He was this a destroyer and he had incredible endurance.
I mean,

2138
01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:27.030
he fought and you know,

2139
01:58:27.031 --> 01:58:31.740
was he had the same like pace deep into the fight that he did at the beginning

2140
01:58:31.741 --> 01:58:36.150
of the fight.
And that's what plague Bj.
Bj is just extremely,

2141
01:58:36.151 --> 01:58:39.630
extremely talented,
extremely game,
very aggressive,

2142
01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:43.690
but didn't like to train hard,
didn't like to push himself,

2143
01:58:43.691 --> 01:58:46.590
didn't like to get outside.
I mean,
you know,
he'll dispute that he should go.

2144
01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:49.690
Of course he trained hard,
but did he train the way?

2145
01:58:49.691 --> 01:58:51.280
Train when news with a Marinovich is like,

2146
01:58:51.281 --> 01:58:54.820
he would talk about how he couldn't even hold his kid at night because he was so

2147
01:58:54.821 --> 01:58:58.790
tired.
But that's what it takes to be at that kind of level,
you know?

2148
01:58:58.830 --> 01:58:59.920
And he didn't like that.

2149
01:59:00.570 --> 01:59:00.691
<v 4>Well,</v>

2150
01:59:00.691 --> 01:59:05.160
I hadn't went where it started on this hand saying absolutely one of the greats

2151
01:59:05.161 --> 01:59:07.650
ever and the other side of the debate,
that's one of them.

2152
01:59:07.651 --> 01:59:12.120
And another one was I think has his choices,
his career choices,

2153
01:59:12.150 --> 01:59:15.540
misunderstanding messages that I think were given to him when fighting.

2154
01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:17.370
And I think the biggest one he fought,

2155
01:59:17.371 --> 01:59:21.600
Frankie had Garney lost and a big thing in his brain was,
see,

2156
01:59:21.601 --> 01:59:24.710
he doesn't cut weight.
He's the smaller man and he's faster.

2157
01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:28.170
I'm going to go back up to one 70 and I'll be the Frankie Edgar of one 70 you

2158
01:59:28.171 --> 01:59:32.700
know what I mean?
Frankie Edgar at one 55 him at one seventies theoretically,

2159
01:59:32.701 --> 01:59:35.940
his interpretation of the same approach.
I'm the smaller guy,

2160
01:59:35.941 --> 01:59:39.000
I'm the quicker guy enough with this other bullshit.
I'm just better,

2161
01:59:39.001 --> 01:59:39.834
I'm going to beat guys.

2162
01:59:39.870 --> 01:59:44.250
And then he fought guys like Rory and fucking Nick Diaz and these monsters.

2163
01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:48.120
There's no way this 145 pounders should be in there with Rory Mcdonald.

2164
01:59:48.121 --> 01:59:49.280
Just size and athletic.

2165
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:51.880
<v 0>He should have never been a one 45 or either,
I don't think.</v>

2166
01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:53.950
I think you look like this is skinny,

2167
01:59:53.951 --> 01:59:56.980
emaciated version of Bj Penn when he was there.
I mean,
yeah,

2168
01:59:56.981 --> 01:59:59.170
you can make the weight if you just don't eat any food,

2169
01:59:59.171 --> 02:00:02.380
but then your body eats itself.
That's not smart either.

2170
02:00:02.670 --> 02:00:07.670
The and then him at one 70 was not like Frankie Edgar at one 55 Frankie Edgar,

2171
02:00:07.860 --> 02:00:12.560
one 55 is ripped.
He's in shape.
He's moving fast.
Bj had a role,
you know,

2172
02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:14.410
he looked Pudgy,
he looks soft.

2173
02:00:14.411 --> 02:00:16.900
He just didn't look like the same guy and he fought well.

2174
02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:21.760
He's a very good fighter,
but his physical is the the correct weight for him,

2175
02:00:21.761 --> 02:00:23.920
I will always think is 155 pounds.
Yeah.

2176
02:00:24.020 --> 02:00:26.720
<v 4>Or if there was a one 50 maybe you don't have that existed.</v>

2177
02:00:26.780 --> 02:00:31.040
<v 0>Well,
I think 55 is fine.
You know,
when he fought Diego Sanchez,
if 55 is perfect,</v>

2178
02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:34.670
I think the issue was that Bj needs,

2179
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:36.800
he needed to be outside of his comfort zone.

2180
02:00:36.801 --> 02:00:40.940
He needed to be away from that camp and be,
you know,
with uh,

2181
02:00:40.941 --> 02:00:45.470
Matt Hume type guy who organizes entire camp,
brought in high level guys,

2182
02:00:45.570 --> 02:00:49.940
dictated his training and took him outside of his comfort zone.

2183
02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:55.250
Uh,
yeah,
but he also likes being in Hawaii.
He likes training in Hawaii.
You know,

2184
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:57.320
there's a lot,
you know,
it's a lot there.

2185
02:00:57.390 --> 02:01:01.700
<v 4>There uh,
there is that 10,000 hours theory,
right?
Uh,</v>

2186
02:01:01.810 --> 02:01:03.190
there's a couple of,
you know,
uh,

2187
02:01:03.330 --> 02:01:05.730
guys who have done hard research onto this and one guy,

2188
02:01:05.731 --> 02:01:09.690
there's was a book called talent is overrated and it's buying that it doesn't

2189
02:01:09.691 --> 02:01:12.420
matter what you were born with.
If you outwork everybody,
you'll be the wing man.

2190
02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:16.590
And the other one is called the sports gene.
Right.
And it's the opposite.

2191
02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:19.500
It doesn't matter how fucking hard you work.
If you don't have that gene,

2192
02:01:19.530 --> 02:01:22.300
you can't do it.
Of course,
the truth is somewhere probably in the middle.
Well,

2193
02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:23.850
<v 0>the truth is most certainly in the middle of the,</v>

2194
02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:28.810
the issue is when you got a guy who's got excellent genetics and is working

2195
02:01:28.811 --> 02:01:30.400
hard,
then you get a Jon Jones.

2196
02:01:30.730 --> 02:01:35.050
You get a guy who has fantastic genetics and is super disciplined and focused

2197
02:01:35.051 --> 02:01:38.830
and trains very hard.
That's when you get true elite athletes like Josie,

2198
02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:40.100
you get

2199
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:42.800
<v 5>the elite of the elite when you have the best of both worlds.</v>

2200
02:01:42.801 --> 02:01:45.860
When you got a guy who works really hard,
buddy,
I shit genetics,

2201
02:01:46.100 --> 02:01:48.670
he will never achieve greatness.
They just don't.
They,

2202
02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:52.310
I think you could get close to it even five years ago,
like we mentioned,

2203
02:01:52.311 --> 02:01:54.500
Florian Florian doesn't have no jeans.

2204
02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:57.350
He was just really smart and he worked really,

2205
02:01:57.351 --> 02:02:00.440
really hard and back and look how close he got close,

2206
02:02:00.441 --> 02:02:04.190
but not quite there because he just didn't have the genetics to do it.

2207
02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:08.270
But he sure as fuck got clothes for a nerdy little cat from Boston.

2208
02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:11.840
We didn't have terrible genetics.
I mean,
he's fast.
He had good kicks,

2209
02:02:11.841 --> 02:02:15.590
he had great Jujitsu.
You know,
it's just these elite of the elite,

2210
02:02:15.650 --> 02:02:20.180
the Bj Penn guys,
the guys who just,
they have that little something extra,

2211
02:02:20.570 --> 02:02:24.380
you know,
these,
these Liotta Machida's,
these,
you know,
there's,

2212
02:02:24.381 --> 02:02:28.490
there's guys that just have,
they have everything.
They have genetics,

2213
02:02:28.491 --> 02:02:29.330
like Weidman,

2214
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:34.460
genetics and hard work and focus and mental toughness.
Then breeding,

2215
02:02:34.461 --> 02:02:37.400
his family was good,
his family took care of him,
pointed,

2216
02:02:37.401 --> 02:02:38.900
taught him the things he needed to learn,

2217
02:02:38.901 --> 02:02:41.660
like he had all of it was dad was an NFL player,
you know,

2218
02:02:41.661 --> 02:02:46.520
so it's like those genetics are strong,
you know,
that's,
that's all a big thing.

2219
02:02:46.521 --> 02:02:48.890
And also I think growing up with brothers,

2220
02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:51.770
there's a lot of fighters that grow up with big brothers and they're used to

2221
02:02:51.771 --> 02:02:53.840
fighting in the house all the time.

2222
02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:58.520
And those guys wind up being motherfuckers man.
Like Matt Hughes Mad.

2223
02:02:58.521 --> 02:03:01.280
He was in his brother,
his brother was a mirror,
you know,

2224
02:03:01.281 --> 02:03:04.790
he's got a twin brother was also a savage and they beat the fuck out of each

2225
02:03:04.791 --> 02:03:08.300
other all the time.
And when did you have that sort of an environment?
Man,

2226
02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:12.980
you just use your extra tough.
You're extra strong.
Jon Jones,

2227
02:03:12.981 --> 02:03:17.981
he's too super athlete brothers and one of them is just so 43

2228
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:25.640
and he's,
you see this guy's for real.
That's crazy.
That's not human.

2229
02:03:25.641 --> 02:03:26.870
That's certainly not.

2230
02:03:26.990 --> 02:03:30.770
If you came from outer space and you look down and you saw a pit bull and a

2231
02:03:30.771 --> 02:03:31.201
Chihuahua,

2232
02:03:31.201 --> 02:03:34.190
you wouldn't think those are the same animals we saw me and John John's big

2233
02:03:34.191 --> 02:03:37.520
brother.
You wouldn't think we're on the same thing.
Oh look,

2234
02:03:37.521 --> 02:03:39.710
there's two different kinds of stuff.
This one's smaller.

2235
02:03:39.711 --> 02:03:42.770
This one's three 40 Bridget,
the midget and Shaquille O'Neal.

2236
02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:47.810
Two completely different things.
Yeah,
but they're the same species.
Yeah.
There's,

2237
02:03:47.811 --> 02:03:52.100
there's genetics that are just undeniable and if you get a guy who's got those

2238
02:03:52.101 --> 02:03:56.600
fantastic genetics and he is in just engrossed in MMA,

2239
02:03:56.630 --> 02:04:00.590
I mean his body,
he's his body,
his mind,
his focus.
He lives at breathe,

2240
02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:03.800
eats and sleeps.
It gets up in the morning and thinks,
how do I get better?

2241
02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:07.610
That guy going to be better than you.
There's,
and also this physical power,

2242
02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:11.390
like especially when it comes to striking physical power when it comes to

2243
02:04:11.391 --> 02:04:14.120
striking is something you either born with or you're not.

2244
02:04:14.121 --> 02:04:18.800
Dominick Cruz is not born with it.
He breaks his hands all the time and his,
his,

2245
02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:22.520
his body's kind of fragile in a way.
He's got a mind for it.
Yes.

2246
02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:26.110
But will he be able to beat a guy like Borow?

2247
02:04:26.111 --> 02:04:30.200
Will he able to be able to beat the guys who have the genetics and have that

2248
02:04:30.201 --> 02:04:34.460
physical power as well?
There's these guys that have that knock out power.

2249
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:38.100
That's Anthony rebel Johnson.
This is a god given

2250
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:41.700
<v 0>gift.
The world has given him a hand of cards and it is</v>

2251
02:04:41.900 --> 02:04:42.261
<v 4>excellent.</v>

2252
02:04:42.261 --> 02:04:45.710
And then you put them with Henry Hoof to has a god given gift to take guys like

2253
02:04:45.711 --> 02:04:48.670
that and make them better.
And now we're now we're terrified.
Yeah,

2254
02:04:48.770 --> 02:04:50.550
it's fucking scary.
And Man,

2255
02:04:50.610 --> 02:04:55.580
there's so like the beauty of how he moves is like I trained with a guy,

2256
02:04:55.581 --> 02:04:59.000
Evan Boris,
whose um,
kickboxing coach who trained with Henry.

2257
02:04:59.001 --> 02:05:02.510
He was one of the guys carry in his bucket and learning from him and he's just

2258
02:05:02.511 --> 02:05:06.410
as passionate young guy up in Toronto.
And uh,
he tells me all,

2259
02:05:06.411 --> 02:05:08.510
it gives me insight into how Henry thinks and you know,

2260
02:05:08.511 --> 02:05:13.100
tries to show me stuff too.
Um,
you know,
in through Henry's eyes.

2261
02:05:13.101 --> 02:05:16.880
So you feel like you're learning,
you know,
one step down from this master.
Right.

2262
02:05:17.180 --> 02:05:20.870
And so his thing is with a guy like Anthony Johnson has said,

2263
02:05:20.871 --> 02:05:23.750
Henri Hooft is we'll say to him,
you know,

2264
02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:27.890
you got to be ready.
If you are ready,
you don't got to get ready.

2265
02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:32.180
That's the essential fundamental uh,
plan of Anthony Johnson.

2266
02:05:32.181 --> 02:05:35.110
The way he stands in the way he moves is at all times you're in a,

2267
02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:37.700
in a type of balance where you can deliver power,

2268
02:05:37.810 --> 02:05:41.150
cause you have power and we just need to keep you in a spot where you can

2269
02:05:41.151 --> 02:05:43.840
deliver it all the time.
So his take down defense revolves around that.

2270
02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:45.680
The way his foot works,
it revolves around that.

2271
02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:49.040
It's all built so that at any moment in time when you throw a punch,

2272
02:05:49.130 --> 02:05:52.460
you're in the state to be able to smash with it cause you're,
you have that gift.

2273
02:05:52.750 --> 02:05:52.961
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2274
02:05:52.961 --> 02:05:57.760
And also when you see a guy like hoofed or anyone who teaches that classic Dutch

2275
02:05:57.761 --> 02:05:59.080
style of kickboxing,

2276
02:05:59.380 --> 02:06:03.100
it's such a tactical style and that style can be lost on someone who doesn't

2277
02:06:03.101 --> 02:06:06.430
understand what's going on.
Is it every movement has a purpose.

2278
02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:10.540
Every technique has a purpose.
Every technique chains into another technique.

2279
02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:13.810
The left hook leads to the right low kick and all these,

2280
02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:18.310
these techniques that go together like bread and butter,
they just,
they,
they,

2281
02:06:18.330 --> 02:06:20.570
they're,
they're a part of a system,
you know.

2282
02:06:20.590 --> 02:06:24.280
And Duane Ludwig is the best at breaking down.
It says like he's got books.

2283
02:06:24.430 --> 02:06:27.700
Like he was over at my house the other day and he had all these books,
a detail,

2284
02:06:27.701 --> 02:06:30.970
all his techniques and how they intertwined together and what's,

2285
02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:34.720
he has steps and levels and he has a whole belt system based around these

2286
02:06:34.721 --> 02:06:38.990
techniques.
I mean,
he's spent countless hours analyzing and,
and,
and,

2287
02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:41.710
and categorizing and putting all this stuff together.

2288
02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:46.060
And that's what sort of lost on a lot of people that you aluminate very well

2289
02:06:46.061 --> 02:06:46.990
with your breakdowns.

2290
02:06:47.250 --> 02:06:50.860
<v 4>Thank you.
I appreciate that man.
I can't tell you.
I like how when,</v>

2291
02:06:50.861 --> 02:06:52.080
when I wanted to do that,

2292
02:06:52.140 --> 02:06:56.820
I want it to do it for people like you and Bang Ludwig and fighters and people

2293
02:06:56.821 --> 02:06:57.270
in the Va.

2294
02:06:57.270 --> 02:07:01.260
I wanted them to like it in a what and a fucking means the world to me that

2295
02:07:01.261 --> 02:07:01.680
people like,

2296
02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:02.010
<v 0>yeah.</v>

2297
02:07:02.010 --> 02:07:04.680
Well you break down Jiu Jitsu until you broke down to Eddie's match with boiler.

2298
02:07:04.710 --> 02:07:05.330
Yeah,
yeah,

2299
02:07:05.330 --> 02:07:08.060
<v 4>yeah.
At Jiu Jitsu it's something I've trained a lot for a while.</v>

2300
02:07:08.210 --> 02:07:09.830
And then I was in an environment where like,

2301
02:07:09.831 --> 02:07:13.070
I was literally in one day he'll hooked by like three guys who intended to

2302
02:07:13.071 --> 02:07:16.600
injure me.
Like it was a really bad environment and that own was

2303
02:07:18.140 --> 02:07:21.230
not a god of wrath,
but,
but it was like,
you know,

2304
02:07:21.231 --> 02:07:24.340
people and they were just guys in the gym,
but there was a little culture of God.

2305
02:07:24.380 --> 02:07:27.500
I'm like,
who's that fucking guy wears makeup is on TV,
thinks he's a fucking,

2306
02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:32.110
and they'd like came after me one and so I started trying to hurt you.
Yeah,

2307
02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:33.553
for sure.

2308
02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:38.850
Specifically heal hooks for the purpose of trying to me one.
Wow.

2309
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:40.690
And later I heard I'd been,
you know,

2310
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:43.390
heard from a number of people that that was a bit of the emo of a couple of,

2311
02:07:43.391 --> 02:07:45.160
anyways,
it's one of those things is like,

2312
02:07:45.670 --> 02:07:49.390
so I kind of got away from it for awhile and then um,
uh,

2313
02:07:49.391 --> 02:07:50.680
I started reading Eddie's books.

2314
02:07:50.681 --> 02:07:53.240
Actually I'm going to train at his place tomorrow night.
Hey,
yeah,

2315
02:07:53.740 --> 02:07:55.660
I trained last time I was in la,
I trained over there.

2316
02:07:55.661 --> 02:08:00.550
Fuck you take one class with Eddie Bravo and your whole understanding of

2317
02:08:00.551 --> 02:08:03.880
everything you think you know about Jujitsu,
the whole thing fucking falls apart.

2318
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:04.743
Like it's,

2319
02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:09.460
it's so crazy that you sit there and it's like these are positions people use,

2320
02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:13.120
you know,
whatever.
We'll take the 10 or 15 of them and the guy goes in,

2321
02:08:13.121 --> 02:08:16.630
in between.
As you know,
obviously in between each of those,

2322
02:08:16.631 --> 02:08:20.040
there's an entire universe of,
of stuff to do in between the,

2323
02:08:20.110 --> 02:08:24.640
the positions that people already know,
US positions,
entire worlds,
you know.
Yeah.

2324
02:08:24.730 --> 02:08:29.730
<v 0>That's what he has done a fantastic job of not just incorporating his own</v>

2325
02:08:31.061 --> 02:08:34.210
techniques but incorporating other people's techniques into his style as well.

2326
02:08:34.211 --> 02:08:36.730
And just spent just like Dwayne,

2327
02:08:36.750 --> 02:08:41.080
countless hours analyzing positions and using them in the lab,

2328
02:08:41.110 --> 02:08:45.820
using them in the gym and using them with high level guys and figuring out like

2329
02:08:46.090 --> 02:08:47.170
a guy in his gym.

2330
02:08:47.171 --> 02:08:50.320
We'll come up with some new variation on a specific technique and then they'll

2331
02:08:50.321 --> 02:08:53.160
add it to the rotation and then the rectal drill it and then they'll,

2332
02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:57.770
<v 4>so trying to find another answer.
When I was there just that one time,</v>

2333
02:08:57.771 --> 02:08:59.930
and I had trained with Eddie,
we met in Toronto one time.

2334
02:08:59.931 --> 02:09:03.230
I took him up for a bunch of drinks and it was funny.
He's a really cool dude.

2335
02:09:03.231 --> 02:09:04.100
It's really cool to be,

2336
02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:07.970
have a buddy like that and I haven't been invited me to his gym and,
and stuff.

2337
02:09:08.330 --> 02:09:12.830
And,
uh,
he uh,
you know,
I I've got his books and uh,
you know,
you see,

2338
02:09:12.831 --> 02:09:15.890
okay I understand your mission control and make sure you got the leg lock.

2339
02:09:15.891 --> 02:09:19.870
You know the invisible collarb do,
do claw,
that kind of basic stuff.
You know,

2340
02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:22.370
they read a little bit about his basics.

2341
02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:25.310
You'll be a little bit about twister side control on the twist and then you

2342
02:09:25.311 --> 02:09:28.970
think you have an idea of what,
what the Eddie Bravo system is.

2343
02:09:28.971 --> 02:09:31.880
If you read that like I thought well in the world,
the guys who know about,

2344
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:35.060
about MMA,
I think,
I know you take one class for them,

2345
02:09:35.061 --> 02:09:36.410
you don't know fucking anything.

2346
02:09:36.411 --> 02:09:40.910
Like there was something we did from some truck position and my first curiosity

2347
02:09:40.911 --> 02:09:44.160
was I need to know how this guy's brain thinks like why he thinks these,

2348
02:09:44.210 --> 02:09:45.350
how he comes up with this shit.

2349
02:09:45.351 --> 02:09:49.220
Cause there was something that felt a lot like a locked down position from

2350
02:09:49.221 --> 02:09:51.470
another angle upside down while holding a leg.
And I'm like,

2351
02:09:51.471 --> 02:09:53.030
okay well this is brain.

2352
02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:53.201
<v 0>Well,</v>

2353
02:09:53.201 --> 02:09:56.860
there's a lot of techniques you can reverse the positions of the bodies and just

2354
02:09:56.861 --> 02:10:00.760
say,
look,
well if I,
um,
on my back,
I get a guy with a triangle,

2355
02:10:00.761 --> 02:10:05.761
what happens if I'm not on my back but I'm on his back and I'm behind him and

2356
02:10:07.961 --> 02:10:10.330
then I can I,
can I just triangle there?
Yeah.
It's kind of the same thing.

2357
02:10:10.331 --> 02:10:12.530
The arm is there.
It's like,
um,

2358
02:10:12.670 --> 02:10:14.860
remember when Matt Hughes Choked Out Ricardo Almay?

2359
02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:18.070
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
That front choke,
they tee peed up with his head,
right?</v>

2360
02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:20.720
<v 0>Yeah.
And that's essentially an arm triangle,</v>

2361
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:24.890
but it's an arm triangle from a completely different position from a head to

2362
02:10:24.891 --> 02:10:28.880
head position.
So weird thing,
but it's the same position.

2363
02:10:28.881 --> 02:10:33.440
It's still choking off the neck on one side with the forearm and then with the

2364
02:10:33.441 --> 02:10:35.900
neck,
with your own neck and your own,
you know,

2365
02:10:35.901 --> 02:10:37.910
your own body pressing against it on the other side.

2366
02:10:37.970 --> 02:10:41.420
<v 4>And this rest of that element of wrestling that where that was sort of a bull</v>

2367
02:10:41.421 --> 02:10:44.810
dog kind of rest and kind of stuff.
And the Schultz headlock,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2368
02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:45.210
And the,

2369
02:10:45.210 --> 02:10:50.210
the weird like to either in the moment or have trained it either one is amazing

2370
02:10:50.900 --> 02:10:54.920
to figure out that the angle of elevating your hips so high drove that extra

2371
02:10:54.921 --> 02:10:57.480
thing,
like all those little elements made it beautiful.
But uh,

2372
02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:02.090
you have a black belt under Machado as well.
Yeah.
That's fucking crazy.
Yeah.

2373
02:11:02.091 --> 02:11:05.120
You have to,
you have a gay black belt and a black belt in the system.

2374
02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:07.460
When I started training in [inaudible] 96.
Yeah.
Wow.

2375
02:11:07.630 --> 02:11:10.940
And so when you were training in 96 and guys would say,
oh,

2376
02:11:10.941 --> 02:11:13.940
there's some purple belt come through town,
everybody was blown away back then.

2377
02:11:13.941 --> 02:11:15.150
Right?
Like was that the level?

2378
02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:20.320
<v 0>No,
no,
not [inaudible] 96 in [inaudible] 96.
Um,
well there was a few purple belts.</v>

2379
02:11:20.550 --> 02:11:23.820
I started out at um,
um,
Carlson Gracie's.
Yeah,

2380
02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:25.720
I took one class at Hickson's.

2381
02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:28.630
See back then in [inaudible] 96 I didn't know that there was a difference

2382
02:11:28.631 --> 02:11:32.590
between Carlson Gracie and Hixon Gracie.
It was just Gracie Jujitsu.

2383
02:11:32.770 --> 02:11:36.250
And the only reason why I went from Carlson's to Hickson's at Hickson's was all

2384
02:11:36.251 --> 02:11:38.950
the way across town.
Carlson's like much closer to me.

2385
02:11:38.951 --> 02:11:40.570
It was like a 20 minute difference in the drive,

2386
02:11:40.571 --> 02:11:43.990
so I just started going to crossings and that was when Vito had just made his

2387
02:11:43.991 --> 02:11:48.991
debut against John Hess and they were actually calling them Victor Gracie and I

2388
02:11:49.241 --> 02:11:54.241
even accidentally referred to him as Victor Gracie during one of the things that

2389
02:11:55.271 --> 02:12:00.150
I did for the UFC in 1997 UFC 12 when I first started working for him baby.

2390
02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:03.350
<v 4>That's fucking UFC 12 yeah.
Let's think about that man.</v>

2391
02:12:03.351 --> 02:12:06.050
How long you been doing that?
I said that I've said this a few times.

2392
02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:09.740
I don't know if you probably don't realize it because when you're in stuff you

2393
02:12:09.741 --> 02:12:10.190
don't do,

2394
02:12:10.190 --> 02:12:14.030
often people that are driven don't often pause to look and be proud of what

2395
02:12:14.031 --> 02:12:18.990
they've done.
Maybe hopefully they do that,
but that you actually invented this,

2396
02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:21.380
the idea of commentating the sport,

2397
02:12:21.381 --> 02:12:24.470
which is very different than any other one and there's so many things that

2398
02:12:24.471 --> 02:12:28.180
people you think are just terms,
but they're terms that you said.

2399
02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:32.120
Do you know what I mean?
Things that you said that are common descriptive things.

2400
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:35.210
They think they've always existed but they didn't exist before.

2401
02:12:35.211 --> 02:12:38.450
You said them in a lot of cases and that's really a wild thing.

2402
02:12:38.451 --> 02:12:43.100
The influence in how people observe this great sport and how big it influenced

2403
02:12:43.101 --> 02:12:43.934
that is,

2404
02:12:44.270 --> 02:12:46.610
<v 0>well,
I definitely don't think about it but the,</v>

2405
02:12:46.611 --> 02:12:50.930
the difference between this sport and a lot of other sports is that this sport,

2406
02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:54.650
the play by play guy is not the play by play guy.

2407
02:12:54.710 --> 02:12:57.710
The color guy is the guy who's the expert.

2408
02:12:57.711 --> 02:13:01.490
The martial arts expert essentially has to be the play by play guy as well

2409
02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:04.880
because he has to break down the subtle nuances of positions to people that are

2410
02:13:04.881 --> 02:13:07.130
watching at home.
Especially when it comes to the ground.

2411
02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:12.280
Right is a big issue with explaining Jujitsu to people that don't know Jujitsu

2412
02:13:12.561 --> 02:13:15.770
so they can enjoy it because if someone doesn't know like why is that guy

2413
02:13:15.771 --> 02:13:17.840
hurting?
Like what's what's,
what's going on there?

2414
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:20.500
<v 4>UFC One,
what happened there?
Exactly,</v>

2415
02:13:20.500 --> 02:13:23.080
<v 0>exactly.
There's,
especially when it comes to the ground game,</v>

2416
02:13:23.110 --> 02:13:26.590
there's a bunch of positions that need to be illuminated.
So when,

2417
02:13:26.620 --> 02:13:29.230
when fights are happening,
I'm calling,

2418
02:13:29.530 --> 02:13:33.420
like I'm doing a play by play color job.
Like I'm also,

2419
02:13:33.421 --> 02:13:38.400
I'm giving like if you watch boxing,
the color guy will say,

2420
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:38.850
you know,

2421
02:13:38.850 --> 02:13:43.850
they'll sort of like give you like an overall assessment of what's going on.

2422
02:13:44.641 --> 02:13:47.190
But Jim Lampley,
who's the play by play guy,

2423
02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:51.420
we'll explain like the shots that are landing and this and that that's going on.

2424
02:13:51.630 --> 02:13:54.220
And then the color guy will say,
well he needs to do that.
And he says,

2425
02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:58.020
<v 4>and he says the how and the why.
Yes.
When I worked with Mauro,</v>

2426
02:13:58.021 --> 02:14:02.640
I did it like a few dozen shows her moral and uh,
he uh,

2427
02:14:02.730 --> 02:14:05.370
explains to you that in his case he knows it.

2428
02:14:05.490 --> 02:14:09.000
So he will do the what and your job is the how and the why.

2429
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:12.960
So when you do color with Mauro,
it is,
he does it old school,

2430
02:14:13.050 --> 02:14:15.650
which is why he's so natural at boxing.
No,

2431
02:14:15.670 --> 02:14:20.670
he transitioned in a boxing so naturally because he was not an actual play by

2432
02:14:21.511 --> 02:14:22.650
play guy.
But the odd thing,

2433
02:14:22.651 --> 02:14:26.340
and I'm a fucking full on moral fan and he had a huge influence in helping with

2434
02:14:26.341 --> 02:14:27.090
a lot of stuff.

2435
02:14:27.090 --> 02:14:32.090
But because if you're a play by play guy and you're not really obsessed,

2436
02:14:32.191 --> 02:14:33.390
if you're not deep into it,

2437
02:14:33.810 --> 02:14:37.650
he will start to get certain things where you are missing out on stuff.

2438
02:14:37.651 --> 02:14:42.090
So he might say,
you know,
uh,
he's on his back.
Why doesn't he put the hooks in?

2439
02:14:42.270 --> 02:14:45.020
Well,
if he wants to ride heavy on the hip,
he doesn't want that.
He wants to ride,

2440
02:14:45.090 --> 02:14:45.480
you know?

2441
02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:50.130
And so you start to sort of project what you think is next.

2442
02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:53.010
And that's why when you do color,

2443
02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:55.290
you're saying what is happening and what might happen.

2444
02:14:55.650 --> 02:14:58.290
<v 0>Well,
there's a difference between moral doesn't train,
right?</v>

2445
02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:01.800
He's not a black belt.
He doesn't,
yeah,
you,
you,
you have to be,

2446
02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:04.410
I really believe that you have,
well,
I don't know if you have to be a black belt,

2447
02:15:04.411 --> 02:15:08.760
but you have to be a high level grappler to understand the nuances.
And you've,

2448
02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:12.650
I think you also should have some competition in your life,

2449
02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:16.950
some form of it where you understand the psychology behind competing,

2450
02:15:16.951 --> 02:15:18.120
rising into the occasion.

2451
02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:21.000
What's going on in that moment when you see a guy who's breaking,

2452
02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:23.880
you know you can,
you can learn a lot by watching.

2453
02:15:23.881 --> 02:15:28.200
But I think doing is really important and critical when it comes to breaking

2454
02:15:28.201 --> 02:15:29.860
down Jujitsu.
Um,

2455
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:33.480
I've seen like I was watching a private the other day and someone that,

2456
02:15:33.550 --> 02:15:34.890
one of the guys and wasn't boss,

2457
02:15:34.891 --> 02:15:39.330
it was whoever was doing it with was I'm talking about a position and it was

2458
02:15:39.331 --> 02:15:43.300
saying that he couldn't choke this guy out because the arm is in on the gaiety.

2459
02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:47.590
Like he didn't know you guys didn't know it but that's hilarious.
It's crazy.

2460
02:15:47.670 --> 02:15:48.810
But what time was that?

2461
02:15:48.811 --> 02:15:53.160
It was like 93 like people knew in 93 that arming guillotines we're legit.

2462
02:15:53.370 --> 02:15:56.980
So like watching this,
this was clearly a guy who doesn't grow.

2463
02:15:56.981 --> 02:15:59.520
I think it was quadros guy.
It was a guy who doesn't grapple.

2464
02:15:59.610 --> 02:16:04.560
He doesn't understand and it's just going on his limited a book of knowledge,

2465
02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:06.060
but it's not based on,

2466
02:16:06.090 --> 02:16:10.630
it's not an extensive comprehensive like encyclopedia of,

2467
02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:15.510
of training and knowledge and of being obsessed with combat sports.

2468
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:20.100
<v 4>Uh,
Chavela I worked with two and fuck is that Guy Fun?
He's great.</v>

2469
02:16:20.110 --> 02:16:24.570
Sell fucking fun.
Great.
Such a good dude.
And he's having so much fun.
Trust me.

2470
02:16:24.571 --> 02:16:28.710
I'd like it if more here's me talking about him and he thinks I'm being critical

2471
02:16:28.711 --> 02:16:30.160
and it will hurt him.
He's a fucking

2472
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:33.730
<v 5>very tender dude,
but I'm not,
I think Mara is a fucking genius.</v>

2473
02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:37.310
I think he's killing boxing.
I think he's absolutely killing it.
He's amazing.

2474
02:16:37.311 --> 02:16:40.960
He's graded glory to,
yeah,
he was a good dude.
He is.
He really is.

2475
02:16:40.961 --> 02:16:44.290
He really does love fighting.
You know,
it's just what we're saying is just,

2476
02:16:44.291 --> 02:16:48.610
there's a reality of the difference between a play by play guy and the color

2477
02:16:48.670 --> 02:16:53.050
expert position.
Yeah.
And that's why he's such a good play by play guy and a,

2478
02:16:53.051 --> 02:16:54.820
and g,
you know,
he can call it,
and you're right,

2479
02:16:54.821 --> 02:16:59.060
the expert color is what's really going on.
If you,
you know,

2480
02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:01.480
if you were in this place,
what would it feel like?
You know,

2481
02:17:01.481 --> 02:17:03.940
I think that guy on the couch,
he's,
he doesn't know what it feels like.

2482
02:17:03.941 --> 02:17:07.030
Even just have a guide drive his shoulder under your face to Chinese sideways.

2483
02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:09.130
I don't know what that feels like.
It's fucking terrible.

2484
02:17:09.310 --> 02:17:12.640
And you've got to take care of that before you take over any other thing.

2485
02:17:12.641 --> 02:17:17.020
It's into certain positions like the von flue choke member when OSP fought,

2486
02:17:17.310 --> 02:17:21.760
um,
Nikita Karloff and he choked him out with that von flue choke.

2487
02:17:21.761 --> 02:17:24.430
And like a lot of people didn't even know what the fuck was going on.

2488
02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:26.800
But because I've been around for so long,

2489
02:17:26.801 --> 02:17:29.980
I've seen that show before when I remember when von flue started doing it on

2490
02:17:29.981 --> 02:17:33.570
people and then we started trying it out in the gym.
Really fucking oh,

2491
02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:37.930
that's so cool man.
It's weird like that being,
cause I'd like,

2492
02:17:38.350 --> 02:17:42.370
you know,
there's a big difference between then later.
Go on.
Well,
what's that?
Oh,

2493
02:17:42.371 --> 02:17:44.680
it's a von flue.
Choke and gone.
Oh yeah.
I remember when fire,

2494
02:17:44.681 --> 02:17:47.650
when von Flue was in the gym doing it.
That's fucking cool.
Well,

2495
02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:51.990
there was also a scene recently where someone was trying this old boss Rutan net

2496
02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:55.960
crank Bas Rutten has this like fireman's neck crank that he would do.

2497
02:17:56.750 --> 02:17:57.071
Yeah.

2498
02:17:57.071 --> 02:18:01.570
It's like from from like almost like he has a head on one side and the leg on

2499
02:18:01.571 --> 02:18:03.550
the other side,
he tries to connect the two of them together.

2500
02:18:03.950 --> 02:18:07.840
And boss used to tap guys with the bosses of fucking physical beast,
you know,

2501
02:18:07.841 --> 02:18:08.710
such a specimen,

2502
02:18:09.070 --> 02:18:12.100
but somebody tried it in a recent MMA fight and I remember in the middle of the

2503
02:18:12.101 --> 02:18:14.890
fight won't Blah Blah Blah.
I've seen this before.
What fucking choke.

2504
02:18:14.891 --> 02:18:18.400
It's like you never see that technique.
Then all of a sudden it's there.

2505
02:18:18.401 --> 02:18:20.800
It didn't work,
but it could,
you know,

2506
02:18:21.010 --> 02:18:24.370
when I was talking about pancreas boss was the other guy that it was like he's

2507
02:18:24.371 --> 02:18:27.520
walking in the ring and you looked at that and it like,

2508
02:18:27.940 --> 02:18:30.290
you didn't want to be in there with this.
Like,
Hey,

2509
02:18:30.291 --> 02:18:32.930
you see the boss and Pan Christ.
Yeah.

2510
02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:34.840
That would have been as terrifying as a human being.

2511
02:18:34.841 --> 02:18:37.240
Has Anybody had ever seen WWE?
The intensity.

2512
02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:41.200
That's what I thought about him and Evan Tanner and these guys were kind of

2513
02:18:41.201 --> 02:18:44.890
competing and then him and Evan Tanner came in there and it's fucking went
crazy.

2514
02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:49.150
Like they just put it on people.
Like they put a level of hurt on people.

2515
02:18:49.151 --> 02:18:51.430
That would have been terrifying had you never seen that before?

2516
02:18:51.490 --> 02:18:55.610
Well boss was the first like really high level striker in,

2517
02:18:55.630 --> 02:19:00.460
in MMA.
I feel like boss was the first guy.
If you watch his pancreas fights,

2518
02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:02.890
he was blasting guys with kicks.

2519
02:19:02.891 --> 02:19:05.680
Like you hadn't seen anybody kick that hard before.

2520
02:19:05.860 --> 02:19:07.860
It was more about Jujitsu before then.
Yeah,

2521
02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:11.170
I mean you had like Orlando Veit who's like a high level kickboxer was in the

2522
02:19:11.171 --> 02:19:14.800
early UFC,
but he was only like 165 pounds or something.

2523
02:19:14.801 --> 02:19:19.210
Like there was a small guy and he got manhandled by grapplers,
you know,

2524
02:19:19.211 --> 02:19:20.530
and he fought,
um,

2525
02:19:20.970 --> 02:19:24.670
was just fucking name the big judo black belt guy.

2526
02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:28.040
His name escapes me.
He wound up

2527
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:31.870
<v 0>fighting the same guy want to fighting Marco who os and Marco who was mounted</v>

2528
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:36.810
him and he tapped when macro who is planning to them
cap.
Yeah.

2529
02:19:36.930 --> 02:19:41.120
Well it was also because he thought that the position was lost like once a guy

2530
02:19:41.121 --> 02:19:44.840
got you into that position.
Right?
Yeah.
Him,
it probably was for him.

2531
02:19:44.841 --> 02:19:45.674
It probably wasn't,

2532
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:48.710
<v 4>I have an answer for that.
So it's like I can tap now,</v>

2533
02:19:48.850 --> 02:19:52.280
I can tap after he hit me six times or I can tap if you hit me 20 times.
Right.

2534
02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:53.840
<v 0>Gone unconscious.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2535
02:19:53.860 --> 02:19:57.820
There was all a lot of fuck shit back then to where people didn't know that you

2536
02:19:57.821 --> 02:20:01.900
could get out of positions and he thought that when you got into a position like

2537
02:20:01.901 --> 02:20:03.850
that was,
it was over,
you know,

2538
02:20:03.950 --> 02:20:08.010
must have been a wild time in the 90s to be trained in that.
And,
and uh,

2539
02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:09.600
because it was foreign to people.

2540
02:20:09.610 --> 02:20:11.430
Like if you told somebody you were trained in Jujitsu,

2541
02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:13.510
did they know what the hell you were talking about?
No,

2542
02:20:13.511 --> 02:20:14.380
they didn't know what it was.

2543
02:20:14.381 --> 02:20:18.040
Rem Co part do we think we might have called that one recently.

2544
02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:22.300
Remember we fought Orlando VA and got him inside control and blasted him with

2545
02:20:22.301 --> 02:20:22.960
elbows.

2546
02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:26.710
It was in that judo side control holding in head there and just boom elbowed

2547
02:20:26.711 --> 02:20:31.450
them unconscious.
Yeah.
That was fascinating.
Fascinating.

2548
02:20:31.451 --> 02:20:32.210
Fascinating.

2549
02:20:32.210 --> 02:20:37.210
Is watching those guys like watching that sport evolve like that to like in the

2550
02:20:37.911 --> 02:20:41.860
beginnings were just people trying their style out and finding out that it

2551
02:20:41.861 --> 02:20:42.820
didn't work at all.

2552
02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:47.530
Like I remember there was that Ninja Guy Fought Pat Smith in step kicks,

2553
02:20:47.531 --> 02:20:49.870
which kind of John John's kind of brought back.

2554
02:20:49.871 --> 02:20:53.110
Like if you have enough reach and you know which kind of have all that other

2555
02:20:53.111 --> 02:20:53.944
stuff too,

2556
02:20:54.060 --> 02:20:56.680
you know these guys thought they were going to kick you once and take your knee.

2557
02:20:58.300 --> 02:21:00.810
Well there's a lot of people that say that,
you know,
hey man we file,

2558
02:21:00.830 --> 02:21:03.430
just kick somebody in the knee and take 'em out.
Like yeah,
okay.

2559
02:21:03.431 --> 02:21:06.580
Really you really think that it works that way cause you know the guy tries to

2560
02:21:06.581 --> 02:21:08.770
not have you.
Not only that,

2561
02:21:08.771 --> 02:21:11.600
he might see you winding up and like going towards his knee.

2562
02:21:11.630 --> 02:21:12.850
What was this motherfucker doing?

2563
02:21:12.851 --> 02:21:15.090
Like move his knee out of the way and then you're missing things.

2564
02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:17.920
Then you're all confused.
Your go to move didn't work.

2565
02:21:18.040 --> 02:21:22.060
<v 4>Yeah.
And that's sort of the thing you've seen it definitely a guy goes in,</v>

2566
02:21:22.300 --> 02:21:25.930
you know at the low level is kind of where I get to compete and call fights and

2567
02:21:25.931 --> 02:21:29.620
stuff.
Sometimes brand new guys sometimes go in there first thing in their mind.

2568
02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:32.500
This was going to knock a guy out the second that doesn't happen.

2569
02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:34.660
They just stayed,
didn't really think past that.

2570
02:21:34.690 --> 02:21:37.030
Now it's scary and horrifying place to be.

2571
02:21:37.120 --> 02:21:40.510
<v 0>Well I remember Pat Smith fought recently in glory and one of the things that</v>

2572
02:21:40.511 --> 02:21:45.040
really troubled me before his fight,
he said,
I'm a one round fighter.
You know,

2573
02:21:45.130 --> 02:21:49.150
like a,
I fight for one round,
you know,
this is,
I'm,
I'm there to win or lose.

2574
02:21:49.180 --> 02:21:52.490
But it's called going out in one round and then Mike,
you can't say that,

2575
02:21:52.530 --> 02:21:55.900
oh that guy's only job is to survive one round and he's got it.
Well,

2576
02:21:55.901 --> 02:21:57.940
not only that,
it's a crazy way of thinking.

2577
02:21:57.970 --> 02:21:59.500
This fight scheduled for three rounds.

2578
02:21:59.501 --> 02:22:03.250
If the guys exactly the skill level of you,
it's going to take some time,
man.

2579
02:22:03.290 --> 02:22:07.270
Like you can't,
I don't know why he decides to do that.
I mean,

2580
02:22:07.271 --> 02:22:10.150
he's one of those guys that like really likes to put on a show,

2581
02:22:10.390 --> 02:22:12.040
really likes to have an exciting fight.

2582
02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:14.800
And that's one of the things we were talking about earlier as these guys that

2583
02:22:14.801 --> 02:22:19.801
sort of sacrifice technical styles fighting in order to make things more

2584
02:22:20.411 --> 02:22:24.790
exciting.
But in the long run,
that's not good.
It's not good for,

2585
02:22:25.410 --> 02:22:27.900
it's not good.
It's not just not.

2586
02:22:28.650 --> 02:22:33.060
<v 4>Yeah.
And it changes.
Things like that,
that idea that we're,</v>

2587
02:22:33.090 --> 02:22:36.120
the whole thing is going on to try to figure out who's the best,

2588
02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:38.790
not to figure out who is close to the best,

2589
02:22:38.791 --> 02:22:41.220
but the most exciting or not to figure out who can,

2590
02:22:41.340 --> 02:22:45.300
if we all agree that you take down defense has gotta be the most important thing

2591
02:22:45.301 --> 02:22:48.330
for the next two years.
Who gets good at that and landing right hands.
Like,

2592
02:22:48.331 --> 02:22:52.290
it's not,
uh,
it's not a worldwide game to figure out who's the most exciting,

2593
02:22:52.410 --> 02:22:54.660
it's a figure out who's the baddest dude on the planet,

2594
02:22:54.661 --> 02:22:56.430
who's the best fighter in the world.

2595
02:22:56.500 --> 02:23:01.420
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
And the only way you find that his guys competing at their very best,</v>

2596
02:23:01.421 --> 02:23:05.230
like using all of your,
like if guys played chess and they just said,
you know,

2597
02:23:05.231 --> 02:23:09.340
fuck all this strategy and shit,
I'm just going to get gangster at my rook,
like

2598
02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:14.920
no,
me.
That's really essentially the same sort of decision making.

2599
02:23:14.921 --> 02:23:16.030
It doesn't work that way.

2600
02:23:16.360 --> 02:23:21.250
It's all about using all of your talents,
your mental talents,

2601
02:23:21.430 --> 02:23:26.410
your emotional control,
your endurance,
all of those things.
Knowing when to push,

2602
02:23:26.411 --> 02:23:29.590
when to back off,
managing your energy during a fight.

2603
02:23:29.591 --> 02:23:31.710
That's a huge aspect of it as well.
Sure.

2604
02:23:31.780 --> 02:23:35.680
Managing your energy is absolutely critical.
Managing,

2605
02:23:35.681 --> 02:23:39.010
like when do you pour it on,
when do you back off?

2606
02:23:39.370 --> 02:23:40.670
<v 4>Do you have that under control?</v>

2607
02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:45.080
Is that taking care of itself out of stress or out of fear or out of danger or

2608
02:23:45.081 --> 02:23:46.670
because he pushed you,
I mean,

2609
02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:50.510
you talked about one round is Kevin Randleman was like in a fight you for three

2610
02:23:50.511 --> 02:23:51.080
minutes,

2611
02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:53.720
it was going to be the worst hell of three minutes that you've ever had in your

2612
02:23:53.721 --> 02:23:56.150
life,
but if you could get past it,
you've got a chance to beat.

2613
02:23:56.480 --> 02:24:00.420
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a lot of those fast twitch muscle fiber guys that just,</v>

2614
02:24:00.690 --> 02:24:03.060
they have a lot of fucking explosion in the beginning,

2615
02:24:03.061 --> 02:24:06.510
but they just slowly wear themselves out and then there's nothing left at the

2616
02:24:06.511 --> 02:24:09.390
end.
Tyron Woodley.
Yeah.
It's a great example of that.

2617
02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:14.310
He hates it when you talk about that.
I know.
Tough Shit.
Yeah,
it's,
it's important.

2618
02:24:14.311 --> 02:24:17.900
It's my job and I'm a fan of his and I think that he's too big.
Yeah.

2619
02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:21.510
I think he carries too much weight.
I mean,
the guy's got,
he's got a,

2620
02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:23.940
essentially he's running a race,

2621
02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:29.000
it's an endurance race and he's got this monster truck engine and he,

2622
02:24:29.220 --> 02:24:33.060
you know,
he's getting two miles to the gallon,
but for that first two miles,

2623
02:24:33.061 --> 02:24:35.520
she's a mother fucker.
You know what I mean?

2624
02:24:35.610 --> 02:24:38.070
Tyron is one of the best athletes in MMA.

2625
02:24:38.580 --> 02:24:41.640
His wrestling is physical strength is blitzes

2626
02:24:42.190 --> 02:24:43.730
<v 4>blitz this matter what he did to,
what's his name,</v>

2627
02:24:43.731 --> 02:24:48.330
the third day here on and even Carlos condit in the beginning.
Yeah.
You know,

2628
02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:50.330
conduit like until that lag went,
you were like,

2629
02:24:50.450 --> 02:24:54.120
how the fuck did he survive that blitz?
That was crazy.
Well,
his story,

2630
02:24:54.121 --> 02:24:58.350
his lead right hand is so fast.
He's so fast.
So explosive travels.

2631
02:24:58.730 --> 02:25:03.320
We talk about a Hendrickson,
how he can close distance this guy even more so.
Um,

2632
02:25:03.710 --> 02:25:04.460
but uh,

2633
02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:09.460
the what some I think athletic guys we'll try to do is make it not an endurance

2634
02:25:10.491 --> 02:25:10.910
sport.

2635
02:25:10.910 --> 02:25:14.480
They'll make it a sport of sprints and comms and sprints and comms and sprints

2636
02:25:14.481 --> 02:25:18.950
and cons.
And that would be the way to try to be that athlete.

2637
02:25:18.951 --> 02:25:20.210
We haven't seen anyone make that work.

2638
02:25:20.270 --> 02:25:23.060
But I think that's what guys are trying to do is you,

2639
02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:28.120
everything is a 32nd on in a 22nd recovery and fight that way and you know,

2640
02:25:28.121 --> 02:25:31.390
and a train that way and trained to recover that way.
But I don't,

2641
02:25:31.391 --> 02:25:35.110
I can't think of anybody we've seen sort of make that really work yet.

2642
02:25:35.111 --> 02:25:38.410
But I think that's how that level of athletes trying to do it.

2643
02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:40.450
<v 0>Well it's also chill son.
Uh,</v>

2644
02:25:40.510 --> 02:25:44.620
had a comment on MMA and about just the physical demands of the body.
He's like,

2645
02:25:44.650 --> 02:25:48.580
the reality is at 25 minutes is too long.
He's like,

2646
02:25:48.581 --> 02:25:53.110
it's too long to fight.
He goes,
you can't fight at your best for 25 minutes.

2647
02:25:53.290 --> 02:25:57.730
So it all becomes about managing when you,
when you explode,

2648
02:25:57.731 --> 02:26:00.250
when you go after the guy and when you,
you know,

2649
02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:03.190
and for child to say that especially,

2650
02:26:03.310 --> 02:26:07.270
you mean you think about like his fight with Anderson Silva was a crazy

2651
02:26:07.271 --> 02:26:10.150
endurance test.
I mean he is when after Anderson,

2652
02:26:10.151 --> 02:26:14.440
that first fight for four and a half rounds,
just full clip took him down at,

2653
02:26:14.441 --> 02:26:19.020
we'll just push the pace constantly.
Most liking these on Epl,

2654
02:26:19.500 --> 02:26:20.920
<v 4>they say we knew what it was later.</v>

2655
02:26:21.100 --> 02:26:24.220
<v 0>Yeah.
Know.
Um,
and still,
you know,</v>

2656
02:26:24.250 --> 02:26:28.210
that's his thoughts is that it's just too long.
It's just too long.
There's,

2657
02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:31.720
except for a guy like mighty mouse.
Yeah.
Which is crazy.

2658
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:33.630
Why is that 130 pounds,
you know,

2659
02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:37.720
225 pound guy does not have the same requirements when it comes to gravity and

2660
02:26:38.010 --> 02:26:39.430
you know,
there's nothing pulling on them.
Yeah.

2661
02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:43.100
<v 4>That book I was telling you about that a,
I'm in the process of reading that um,</v>

2662
02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:46.860
rise of Superman.
They talk about how some of these guys in the states,

2663
02:26:46.861 --> 02:26:49.740
a lot of the analysis is guys and skateboards.

2664
02:26:49.770 --> 02:26:53.450
The guy on the skateboard have jumped over the Great Wall of China and guys who

2665
02:26:53.490 --> 02:26:54.323
are flipping and,

2666
02:26:54.330 --> 02:26:58.830
and a downhill skiing and stuff that they start to believe that gravity applies

2667
02:26:58.831 --> 02:27:00.450
to them differently.
You know what I mean?

2668
02:27:00.451 --> 02:27:04.560
They start to take action as if gravity does not apply to them the same way.

2669
02:27:04.561 --> 02:27:08.490
I mean,
look at these guys jumps the fucking Great Wall of China on a skateboard.

2670
02:27:08.860 --> 02:27:13.290
Part of his belief when he's in the state to a try this is he has to suspend

2671
02:27:13.291 --> 02:27:13.771
reality.

2672
02:27:13.771 --> 02:27:16.410
Even fucking give that a go because any normal person looks at that and go,

2673
02:27:16.411 --> 02:27:19.170
there's no fucking way I can jump the Great Wall of China on a skateboard,

2674
02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:24.060
but this guy has to put himself into a state where that truth becomes not true.

2675
02:27:25.050 --> 02:27:29.900
Yeah,
fuck that.
I know,
right?
How does that work?
I don't know.

2676
02:27:29.970 --> 02:27:33.260
That's so crazy.
But he,
this guy,
you'll like the book a lot,
man.

2677
02:27:33.410 --> 02:27:36.330
That guy compare us a certain psychedelic trips.

2678
02:27:36.410 --> 02:27:40.920
He looks at how that also alters the brain chemistry and those times where

2679
02:27:40.921 --> 02:27:44.430
people are at one with something where they've actually,
they in some ways,

2680
02:27:44.670 --> 02:27:48.000
reality is just that thing we each have and yours is different now.

2681
02:27:48.090 --> 02:27:51.100
Yours is different in the moments where you bring these,
these brain chemistry,

2682
02:27:51.330 --> 02:27:55.500
this brain chemistry together in a state of flow.
And when you're in that state,

2683
02:27:55.680 --> 02:27:57.810
your reality is different.
And if your reality is different,

2684
02:27:57.811 --> 02:27:58.860
maybe the fuck you can jump.

2685
02:27:59.070 --> 02:28:00.570
<v 0>Well,
kind of makes sense,
right?</v>

2686
02:28:00.571 --> 02:28:05.571
Because isn't reality in a sense objective in that like how you feel about a

2687
02:28:06.181 --> 02:28:09.450
moment changes what that moment means to you.

2688
02:28:09.451 --> 02:28:11.430
So changes your reaction to that moment.

2689
02:28:11.970 --> 02:28:15.990
And I think that like those guys that do that park what park whore.
Yeah.

2690
02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:20.670
Those guys have to be like that.
Exactly right.
How do you think you can do that?

2691
02:28:20.700 --> 02:28:22.100
Those guys nuts,
man.
Yeah,

2692
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:24.890
<v 4>but they,
I mean you hesitate for one second.
You Die.</v>

2693
02:28:25.490 --> 02:28:28.400
And that's the same with us flipping motorcycles.
Same with free climbing,

2694
02:28:28.401 --> 02:28:31.130
fucking mount,
whatever you,
you get it.

2695
02:28:31.131 --> 02:28:35.510
You create a state where if you do not believe for one moment you're dead.

2696
02:28:35.660 --> 02:28:40.430
Not Well Shit,
I lost a fight.
Or Ah man that cost me some money,
death,

2697
02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:45.230
death.
And these guys,
you know,
some of them will say,

2698
02:28:45.290 --> 02:28:50.290
I could spend months learning how to spend 20 minutes of yoga to get a taste of

2699
02:28:50.361 --> 02:28:51.320
that state for a second.

2700
02:28:51.470 --> 02:28:54.490
Or I can put myself on a rock face and have it for three hours,

2701
02:28:54.491 --> 02:28:58.010
two hours out of necessity.
And that's,
and that's what some fighters are doing.

2702
02:28:58.011 --> 02:29:00.380
That's what I mean.
All the top guys are operating in that state.

2703
02:29:00.470 --> 02:29:04.010
<v 0>All of them.
Yeah.
Rock the rock face thing is really interesting,
isn't it?</v>

2704
02:29:04.011 --> 02:29:08.330
When you see those fucking Alex Honnold crazy fuckers and the climb up these

2705
02:29:08.331 --> 02:29:11.210
things free climbing,
it's almost like a different animal.

2706
02:29:12.210 --> 02:29:16.140
<v 4>Human animals walk around.
Sometimes we swim and stuff.
We don't do that.</v>

2707
02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:20.200
<v 0>No.
You know,
well he does,
but he's a human.
I mean,
it is.
I mean,</v>

2708
02:29:20.201 --> 02:29:23.650
it's essentially like putting your focus into something and taking that

2709
02:29:23.651 --> 02:29:26.800
something,
whatever it is to the highest level that's possible.

2710
02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:31.770
And the mind is a big part of it.
But he was talking about how when you're,
um,

2711
02:29:31.780 --> 02:29:33.820
when you're rock climbing,
I had him on the podcast,

2712
02:29:33.821 --> 02:29:37.390
he was talking about rock climbing,
that when you're,
you're doing it,

2713
02:29:37.391 --> 02:29:40.030
you're really pretty chill that it goes,
you,
you don't,

2714
02:29:40.060 --> 02:29:44.290
you don't really feel crazy unless something's really wrong.
He goes,

2715
02:29:44.291 --> 02:29:45.071
most of the time,

2716
02:29:45.071 --> 02:29:49.700
everything is really calm and really chill and you just sorta zen and you were

2717
02:29:49.701 --> 02:29:49.901
just,

2718
02:29:49.901 --> 02:29:52.750
this is what you're doing and you're just going through it and you're putting

2719
02:29:52.751 --> 02:29:54.030
the powder on your hands,

2720
02:29:54.050 --> 02:29:57.400
you're sticking your hands and cracks and you're just pulling yourself up.

2721
02:29:57.700 --> 02:29:58.050
He goes,

2722
02:29:58.050 --> 02:30:03.050
then you kind of get to the top for hours and doing shit that in his case,

2723
02:30:03.821 --> 02:30:06.730
do we shift from,
no one else does anger and stuff.

2724
02:30:06.970 --> 02:30:09.550
Why don't think they do that too much?
They try to just crawl.

2725
02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:14.380
I think the jumping up guys are fucking nuts,
but it's all levels of nuts.

2726
02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:16.100
Yeah.
Well,
you know,

2727
02:30:16.120 --> 02:30:20.050
there was a piece that they did and one of those television shows where they

2728
02:30:20.051 --> 02:30:23.560
talked about Alex or this guy who was also a free climber who was like,
look,

2729
02:30:23.561 --> 02:30:26.050
it's a matter,
it's not a matter of if he's going to fall,

2730
02:30:26.200 --> 02:30:29.380
it's a matter of when he's going to fall and he's going to die when he does.

2731
02:30:29.770 --> 02:30:32.080
And you know,
this guy is kind of freaking the fuck out.

2732
02:30:32.200 --> 02:30:34.870
But then he talked to Alex about,
he like,
man,
maybe not,

2733
02:30:34.930 --> 02:30:38.530
I don't know if he's gonna fall.
This mother fucker might just keep doing that.

2734
02:30:38.710 --> 02:30:43.030
I mean,
he's a guy,
Alex Honnold that just,
that's what he does.

2735
02:30:43.031 --> 02:30:47.530
He lives in his van mean he's got a van with all these like drawers in it with,

2736
02:30:47.531 --> 02:30:50.710
this is where I put my toiletries.
This is where I put my underwear.

2737
02:30:50.711 --> 02:30:53.440
He's got like this,
he's this,
he has a bed in the back of it.

2738
02:30:53.441 --> 02:30:55.750
He sleeps in the bed and then he just climbs everywhere.

2739
02:30:56.370 --> 02:31:00.990
<v 4>That the guys who get to that point of,
of human performance,</v>

2740
02:31:01.290 --> 02:31:06.120
there's a level.
So where we discourage a obsessive compulsiveness,

2741
02:31:06.140 --> 02:31:09.120
you know,
we discouraged.
I'm sure there are damaging things about it,

2742
02:31:09.240 --> 02:31:10.760
but I mean you telling me that fucking guy,

2743
02:31:10.820 --> 02:31:15.810
an extremist version of that and yet it's been focused in a way that stretches

2744
02:31:15.811 --> 02:31:16.644
human performance.

2745
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:17.930
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2746
02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:22.650
I think they're obsessive compulsive is almost the only way to achieve
greatness.

2747
02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:24.180
I don't think there's any other way.

2748
02:31:24.181 --> 02:31:28.470
I don't think you can be like this really rural laxed like,
Hey,
easy come,

2749
02:31:28.471 --> 02:31:32.340
easy go.
You know,
no big deal.
No,
you have to be a fucking maniac.

2750
02:31:32.520 --> 02:31:35.460
It's all about how much focus you have on that goal,

2751
02:31:35.461 --> 02:31:38.800
how much intent you have on that action,
and if you're,

2752
02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:40.740
if you're not completely inset obsessed.

2753
02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:45.420
I've always said that greatness and madness are next door neighbors and they

2754
02:31:45.421 --> 02:31:48.510
borrow each other's sugar because you don't,

2755
02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:50.770
you don't get there without the other.
You have to be,
well,

2756
02:31:50.850 --> 02:31:53.250
I know when I was competing,
when I was at my best,

2757
02:31:53.550 --> 02:31:57.480
when I was a four time state champion and taekwondo and I won the US Open and a

2758
02:31:57.481 --> 02:32:00.330
bunch of the tournament's,
I was crazy.
That's all I did.

2759
02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:03.180
I would train in the middle of the night because I knew that no one else was

2760
02:32:03.181 --> 02:32:05.990
training.
I used to have the keys to the gym so as to go to the,

2761
02:32:05.991 --> 02:32:07.980
the doe jangs with the Koreans call.

2762
02:32:07.981 --> 02:32:10.590
I used to go there at two o'clock in the morning cause I had the keys and I

2763
02:32:10.591 --> 02:32:13.890
would train knowing that no one else was training.
And that was like,

2764
02:32:13.891 --> 02:32:15.960
I felt like I had an edge that way.
Cause I had,

2765
02:32:16.100 --> 02:32:20.250
I seen Mike Tyson talk about how we would run when everyone was asleep because

2766
02:32:20.251 --> 02:32:22.680
he think he felt like he,
his opponent was sleeping.

2767
02:32:22.681 --> 02:32:26.510
So that felt like deck gave him an edge.
So,
you know,
I would like that,

2768
02:32:27.060 --> 02:32:31.020
that kind of insanity.
Like I didn't have anything else going on in my life.

2769
02:32:31.050 --> 02:32:34.080
Everything else I was a loser in,
but I knew I was really good at taekwondo.

2770
02:32:34.110 --> 02:32:38.730
So that was what I,
I was,
I sucked at relationships.
I sucked at work,

2771
02:32:39.090 --> 02:32:43.200
I sucked at school,
I sucked at everything except taekwondo.

2772
02:32:43.410 --> 02:32:45.780
So that became my hundred percent of my focus.

2773
02:32:45.781 --> 02:32:48.780
And I know I was insane at that time.
I know it was some,

2774
02:32:48.810 --> 02:32:49.770
there was something wrong with me.

2775
02:32:49.771 --> 02:32:53.940
It was a terrible way to live your life and less.
That's your only goal.

2776
02:32:54.540 --> 02:32:56.940
<v 4>The scary thing is let's say there's,
you know,</v>

2777
02:32:57.330 --> 02:33:00.920
10,000 guys who are living that way at anything.
Comedy,
fuck,

2778
02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:04.160
fighting anything.
Only one of them's accident.
The,

2779
02:33:04.210 --> 02:33:08.430
we're going to get the 10,000 most obsessed and we're gonna find out who the

2780
02:33:08.431 --> 02:33:11.580
very best,
most obsessed or Jeanette.
You know what I mean?

2781
02:33:11.590 --> 02:33:14.400
The genetics and the obsession must come together in the perfect

2782
02:33:14.410 --> 02:33:18.780
<v 0>storm because if your competing and you have the same amount of obsession as</v>

2783
02:33:18.781 --> 02:33:23.160
some John Jones character,
fuck that guy's just too goddamn strong.
Too Big.

2784
02:33:23.161 --> 02:33:26.640
Like you see guys like get in there with John and then when John Locke's up with

2785
02:33:26.641 --> 02:33:30.360
them and then sends him flying through the air,
they realize,
oh,

2786
02:33:30.720 --> 02:33:31.770
there's another level.
Yes.

2787
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:35.930
<v 4>Who any almost took off to Sherri's arm.
That must've been fucking terrifying.</v>

2788
02:33:36.050 --> 02:33:37.310
He's been in there with chocolate,

2789
02:33:37.311 --> 02:33:41.480
Dal and every great fighter at 205 pounds over the last 10 years of not losing

2790
02:33:41.481 --> 02:33:43.940
and training every day.
And this guy does this to him

2791
02:33:44.600 --> 02:33:48.430
<v 0>or a part in the first round with some new move that he had been thinking about</v>

2792
02:33:48.431 --> 02:33:49.264
doing.

2793
02:33:49.270 --> 02:33:53.140
John had just been thinking about it with John is so brilliant in his ability to

2794
02:33:53.141 --> 02:33:58.030
improvise in the heat of battle.
Like he saw the glow over was loading up,

2795
02:33:58.210 --> 02:34:02.620
so he decided to stand like right on top of him and then he would anticipate,

2796
02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:06.700
would feel him loading up and then avoid those shots and counter with elbows in

2797
02:34:06.701 --> 02:34:07.270
tight.

2798
02:34:07.270 --> 02:34:10.960
And he was fucking glove or up in the place where Glover thought that he was

2799
02:34:10.961 --> 02:34:12.220
going to dominate.
Yeah.
And they

2800
02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:16.060
<v 4>went in there and the things that just,
he never even planned to use,</v>

2801
02:34:16.061 --> 02:34:18.010
but a lifetime Greco Roman

2802
02:34:18.250 --> 02:34:21.400
<v 5>playing in there.
Oh Shit,
I witness position.
Fuck it.
We're going to,</v>

2803
02:34:21.430 --> 02:34:24.100
we're gonna win it here.
Then we'll that loose under hook.

2804
02:34:24.170 --> 02:34:27.340
That was what allowed him the,
you know,
Glover had this loose under hook.

2805
02:34:27.490 --> 02:34:31.840
So John just wrenched it just yet yanked on it with the overlook and tore his

2806
02:34:31.841 --> 02:34:34.990
shoulder up.
And it must have been mentally freaky too.
It's like,

2807
02:34:34.991 --> 02:34:36.310
what the hell am I in here with?

2808
02:34:36.490 --> 02:34:39.010
I thought I was just sitting here with a guy punches and kicks and chokes like

2809
02:34:39.011 --> 02:34:42.130
the rest of us.
Why does he do it's tearing off part of my body.

2810
02:34:42.370 --> 02:34:44.950
Well John is just,
he's always adding new wrinkles.

2811
02:34:44.951 --> 02:34:48.280
Like John is the first one of the first guys to really get good at that front

2812
02:34:48.281 --> 02:34:49.660
leg side kick to the thigh.

2813
02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:54.370
I mean he's real and he went to the downward angle too tall.
Yeah.

2814
02:34:54.600 --> 02:34:59.450
Well and also he's shooting down at your knee and John John Dropped v tour with

2815
02:34:59.451 --> 02:35:03.700
the front leg side kick to the body.
You know those,
those long legs.
Man,

2816
02:35:03.701 --> 02:35:07.590
if that's a huge advantage.
We only measure reach with uh,

2817
02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:12.460
with arms in MMA because we have this goofy system where all we do is copy

2818
02:35:12.461 --> 02:35:16.150
boxing because it's such a young sport.
We copied boxing when it comes to reach,

2819
02:35:16.151 --> 02:35:18.790
we copied box and when it comes to the 10 point must scoring system,

2820
02:35:19.210 --> 02:35:22.960
both things are woefully inadequate when it comes to MMA.

2821
02:35:23.170 --> 02:35:25.530
But a big one is the reach of kicks for sure.

2822
02:35:25.630 --> 02:35:30.630
Because John can kick you from a range where you can't even touch him and he's

2823
02:35:30.671 --> 02:35:32.200
hitting you with his best weapon.

2824
02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:35.740
I mean no and outside distance that he owns.

2825
02:35:36.070 --> 02:35:39.400
And your only way to get past that is to go through that.
Come on.

2826
02:35:39.401 --> 02:35:42.610
That's sparely fair.
And his legs are so much,

2827
02:35:42.790 --> 02:35:44.620
everybody kicks harder than the punch everybody does.

2828
02:35:44.621 --> 02:35:45.970
And John's an excellent kicker.

2829
02:35:46.300 --> 02:35:49.390
So he's out there kicking the shit out of you and you can't even touch him.

2830
02:35:49.810 --> 02:35:50.980
And what are you going to start doing?

2831
02:35:51.250 --> 02:35:53.830
You're going to start you on what was shot dead and trying to clear out of that

2832
02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:58.180
range.
You can't,
I mean you,
the way to handle it,

2833
02:35:58.240 --> 02:36:01.300
if it's humanly mentally possible as to pass it and get in there,

2834
02:36:01.540 --> 02:36:05.000
but he's training you the way you touch an element.
You never touch it again.

2835
02:36:05.001 --> 02:36:07.210
And he's doing that with his fucking kick and the front of it.
Also,

2836
02:36:07.211 --> 02:36:11.380
I think it's fascinating that John is now at this level where he's been the

2837
02:36:11.381 --> 02:36:16.090
champion for several years now and he's very confident and he's also used to

2838
02:36:16.091 --> 02:36:17.590
these championship contest.

2839
02:36:17.591 --> 02:36:19.870
He's used to the bright lights he's used to the big event.

2840
02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:22.510
It becomes a part of his every,

2841
02:36:22.540 --> 02:36:25.330
he understands that experience very intimately.

2842
02:36:25.570 --> 02:36:28.630
So when he gets in there championship fights with a guy like glow over,

2843
02:36:28.631 --> 02:36:32.740
this is the big show for Glover.
Holy Shit,
this is it.
And for John,

2844
02:36:32.741 --> 02:36:36.610
like here we go again and here we go again.
Is very different than all my God,

2845
02:36:36.611 --> 02:36:37.420
this is a,

2846
02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:41.020
here we go again as a much more comfortable place because every other time I've

2847
02:36:41.021 --> 02:36:43.600
been in this place,
I won.
People went crazy.

2848
02:36:43.601 --> 02:36:46.790
I made a bunch of money and I got even bigger.
Oh,
I'm in this place again.

2849
02:36:47.330 --> 02:36:51.190
And I love the,
his,
uh,
his attitude after the Gustafson fight.

2850
02:36:51.490 --> 02:36:52.510
Like his attitude was,

2851
02:36:52.511 --> 02:36:56.420
I've always been asking for a dog fight and I got what I asked for.
You know,

2852
02:36:56.470 --> 02:37:00.000
and this is a blessing and he's,
and you know,
it is [inaudible].

2853
02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:03.070
You don't know if you're just wrecking every guy.
Well,

2854
02:37:03.071 --> 02:37:05.860
what happens to one day where I can't wreck you for four routes when now he

2855
02:37:05.861 --> 02:37:09.760
knows,
he knows what he knows.
He can do wins.
Yeah.
Dug deep.

2856
02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:13.660
That was one of the most important aspects of that fight is that he faced a guy,

2857
02:37:13.661 --> 02:37:16.310
first of all,
with the same sort of physical advantages that he has.

2858
02:37:16.610 --> 02:37:19.940
I got with a really long reach,
a guy who was an excellent striker,
a better,

2859
02:37:19.941 --> 02:37:20.774
smoother,

2860
02:37:20.780 --> 02:37:25.640
more efficient striker than he is who took him down Confu added confusion to

2861
02:37:25.641 --> 02:37:26.750
that,
to the equation.

2862
02:37:27.050 --> 02:37:31.070
Did something unpredictable and then on top of that is still one.
Yeah.
You know,

2863
02:37:31.071 --> 02:37:33.260
and then man,
I was really looking forward to that rematch.

2864
02:37:33.290 --> 02:37:35.240
It was a bummer when Gustafson hurt his knee.

2865
02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:39.380
But what's interesting is Gustafson hurt his knee.
They canceled the fight,

2866
02:37:39.381 --> 02:37:44.060
but now John hurt his knee.
But the Cormier fight is still on.
Yeah.

2867
02:37:44.061 --> 02:37:48.800
Well of it's run by a commerce.
Yeah.
I mean we have to wear in the business then.

2868
02:37:48.850 --> 02:37:52.980
I don't think the UFC,
what's the bigger fight though?
And you want it?
I'm more,

2869
02:37:53.570 --> 02:37:56.170
they're both pretty fucking both.
Pretty Fun.
It's pretty fucking good.

2870
02:37:56.740 --> 02:37:58.520
I think they're both tens.
Yeah.

2871
02:37:58.540 --> 02:38:01.790
Call me is so fascinating because we haven't seen it.
You know,

2872
02:38:01.791 --> 02:38:04.970
you see all you gotta do is flash up what he did to Dan Henderson,

2873
02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.460
throwing them up in there.
No one's ever done that to Dan Henderson.

2874
02:38:07.461 --> 02:38:10.310
He got and then you got all this heat that gets regular people excited.

2875
02:38:10.820 --> 02:38:15.820
But I mean what happens when a guy got that close Gustafson's confident he's,

2876
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:18.350
he believes he's going to win this time.

2877
02:38:18.351 --> 02:38:22.250
He thinks he's learned some things like that's real.
You gotta do 'em both.

2878
02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:25.910
But I think he got to do the one that the people are most excited about,

2879
02:38:25.911 --> 02:38:28.670
which is the one where guys fight on a stage and then say they're going to kill

2880
02:38:28.671 --> 02:38:30.920
each other off time.
I think that's how it's more exciting.

2881
02:38:31.310 --> 02:38:34.970
It's like almost like when when Daniel Cormier grabbed John's neck and threw him

2882
02:38:34.971 --> 02:38:39.880
back,
he ensured that that fight was going to take place.
You know,
cause you know,

2883
02:38:39.920 --> 02:38:44.690
if Gustafson got knee surgery and John can't fight until January,

2884
02:38:44.960 --> 02:38:48.290
I mean we should go back to that.
Yeah.
In theory that should be the fight.

2885
02:38:48.470 --> 02:38:52.610
But everyone is so hyped up on the,
the coronary fight now.
But you know,

2886
02:38:52.611 --> 02:38:54.620
core may went into that fight,

2887
02:38:54.621 --> 02:38:57.620
like you agreed to that fight with a preexisting injury that he was pretty vocal

2888
02:38:57.621 --> 02:39:00.080
about it.
He has a partially torn ACL,

2889
02:39:00.081 --> 02:39:03.740
he's got an MCL strain or a tear in his MCL and he's,
you know,

2890
02:39:03.770 --> 02:39:06.020
now he has more of an opportunity to rehab it.

2891
02:39:06.021 --> 02:39:10.040
But when you have a partially torn ligament,
like especially in ACL ligament,

2892
02:39:10.041 --> 02:39:12.980
I dunno how much rehab you can do,
you know,

2893
02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:18.880
you either get the surgery or you live with it and that and whenever 75% state

2894
02:39:19.011 --> 02:39:22.940
it's,
and until you get the surgery,
I think it's a 50% so I think it's 50% torn.

2895
02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:24.550
All three of those guys.
That's knee issues.

2896
02:39:24.551 --> 02:39:26.860
I don't know if that's how two oh five thing.
It's a height thing.

2897
02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:31.550
It's a wrestling,
wrestling thing.
Wrestling and Jujitsu and,
well look,

2898
02:39:31.551 --> 02:39:35.870
I mean even kickboxing you're going to have knee issues,
but just the nice sucks.

2899
02:39:36.170 --> 02:39:40.370
It's a shitty design.
Shoulders sucks.
Well it's not that they suck.

2900
02:39:40.371 --> 02:39:43.460
It's the human body's not designed for MMA and not for that.

2901
02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:44.990
Especially not for Jujitsu.

2902
02:39:45.010 --> 02:39:49.190
I mean Jiu Jitsu is all about testing the boundaries of your joints.

2903
02:39:49.350 --> 02:39:51.470
He Alma planet guys over that.
It's shit.

2904
02:39:51.471 --> 02:39:56.471
It's wants to do that office to do that and there was a few guys like Keeney

2905
02:39:56.930 --> 02:39:59.900
Cornelia said,
I've just unbelievably ridiculous flexibility of their joints.

2906
02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:01.130
Like what is that from?

2907
02:40:01.131 --> 02:40:05.900
Is that from straining them all the time and pushing and pushing to the limit?

2908
02:40:05.930 --> 02:40:10.520
Yeah,
like in theory,
how do you stretch your neck?
Add those circles if you're,

2909
02:40:10.521 --> 02:40:14.190
you know,
or you stretch your lip or whatever.
Can we do with with ligaments

2910
02:40:14.190 --> 02:40:14.530
<v 4>and software</v>

2911
02:40:14.530 --> 02:40:17.470
<v 0>tissue?
I guess they can.
We'll look at Hoya.
Gracie,
when he fought Eddie,</v>

2912
02:40:17.650 --> 02:40:19.660
I'm going to tell you something.
I've been in that position before.

2913
02:40:19.870 --> 02:40:21.070
You know that is a brew.

2914
02:40:21.140 --> 02:40:24.660
When Eddie had that leg and he was twisting the Oilers leg like that,

2915
02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:28.870
that that's called a vaporizer is an unbelievably painful position.

2916
02:40:28.871 --> 02:40:30.700
I do not know how heuler didn't tap.

2917
02:40:30.740 --> 02:40:34.680
<v 4>Yeah,
mental that that way.
I don't think that was some biological,</v>

2918
02:40:34.681 --> 02:40:38.780
it's thing he's authored.
I think that was a guy just saying,
my life depends on,

2919
02:40:38.810 --> 02:40:42.320
you know,
his reputation,
who he is as a person,
his business,

2920
02:40:42.350 --> 02:40:45.710
all of those things dependent so heavily on him not giving into pain.

2921
02:40:45.860 --> 02:40:47.870
And I think he was capable of,
of doing that.

2922
02:40:47.900 --> 02:40:50.570
<v 0>But he has a history of having incredibly flexible joints.</v>

2923
02:40:50.750 --> 02:40:53.900
Like when he fought Sakuraba Sakuraba had him in that deep,

2924
02:40:53.901 --> 02:40:57.380
deep Kamora and the referee stopped the fight and he was furious.
He was like,

2925
02:40:57.381 --> 02:41:01.460
I'm fine.
Like he had his arm like cranked up behind his back,
you know,

2926
02:41:01.461 --> 02:41:01.911
first of all,

2927
02:41:01.911 --> 02:41:05.870
it's crazy when you think of the fact that Heuler Gracie fought Sakuraba and

2928
02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:08.780
Sakuraba fought Vitor Belfort and Vandelay Silva.

2929
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:12.170
Like thinking about the difference in size between those guys.

2930
02:41:12.260 --> 02:41:15.740
I mean incredible being just unbelievable.
Uh,

2931
02:41:15.770 --> 02:41:19.630
he won the fucking Abu Dhabi's at one 45.
Yeah.
You know,

2932
02:41:20.090 --> 02:41:25.090
<v 4>and fuck does giants.
Yeah.
How the fuck,
that was another time.
And,</v>

2933
02:41:25.130 --> 02:41:28.820
I mean I love hearing the stories from guys that were around in the early days

2934
02:41:28.821 --> 02:41:29.511
when they're like,
yeah,

2935
02:41:29.511 --> 02:41:32.090
well you know we drove nine hours cause they said we were going to have uh,

2936
02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:35.020
an MMA fight and we got there and they saw all your opponent's side here you've

2937
02:41:35.021 --> 02:41:38.480
got this guy.
And he's like,
I wait one 40,
he's won 75.
They're like close enough.

2938
02:41:38.481 --> 02:41:43.070
Fight them.
You know,
that's how it was.
And who is that guy?
Where does he train?

2939
02:41:43.071 --> 02:41:46.060
I Dunno,
he just got out of prison or do you want the bouncer?
I mean,

2940
02:41:46.190 --> 02:41:50.480
and that's who you fought.
And these lunatics on the front end of the sport.

2941
02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:54.840
We're driving around for $100 spending 300 to get there.
Not Knowing.
I mean,

2942
02:41:54.841 --> 02:41:56.770
you didn't know if the guy knew the death touch or something.

2943
02:41:56.771 --> 02:41:57.620
He didn't know if there was,

2944
02:41:57.890 --> 02:42:02.700
you didn't know if there was some other things he could do
back then.

2945
02:42:03.070 --> 02:42:03.920
What if they knew it?

2946
02:42:03.980 --> 02:42:06.860
<v 0>There's people still teaching that stupid shit and there's people out there,</v>

2947
02:42:06.861 --> 02:42:09.770
they're also still teaching.
You know what we do works on the streets.

2948
02:42:10.250 --> 02:42:12.680
The streets are very different when you do as a sport.

2949
02:42:12.890 --> 02:42:16.730
That nonsense drives me fucking bananas.
I was on the opiate,

2950
02:42:16.731 --> 02:42:18.440
Anthony shown these to have this guy they'd like to,

2951
02:42:18.450 --> 02:42:22.850
their security is fucking fake karate guy and he would always talk about like a

2952
02:42:22.851 --> 02:42:23.780
street techniques.

2953
02:42:23.781 --> 02:42:27.010
What we're doing is all about street street defense and I go live meet.

2954
02:42:27.020 --> 02:42:31.910
Let me tell you something dude.
What works on trained killers is the best shit.

2955
02:42:32.210 --> 02:42:35.090
All this nonsense about like street techniques.

2956
02:42:35.091 --> 02:42:37.700
Like you're going to do that and do this and that's going to work better and

2957
02:42:37.701 --> 02:42:41.270
you're going to fucking death touched somebody in their solar plexus and go

2958
02:42:41.271 --> 02:42:45.170
after their pressure points.
Bullshit.
It's all nonsense.
You know,

2959
02:42:45.380 --> 02:42:47.630
and if you try to bite somebody,
let me tell you something.

2960
02:42:47.631 --> 02:42:50.510
If a guy gets on top of you and mounts you and you just bid him,

2961
02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:53.930
he's going to fucking kill you apps.
He's going to take your eyes out,

2962
02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:56.270
he's going to kill you.
He's going to break your jaw.

2963
02:42:56.420 --> 02:42:59.360
He's going to tear your arms out of their sockets and leave you a cripple.

2964
02:42:59.510 --> 02:43:01.160
And that God could do that for sure.

2965
02:43:01.250 --> 02:43:03.620
And if you get all this street shit in your head,

2966
02:43:04.050 --> 02:43:08.040
<v 4>dangerous.
But if you get your train a crab,
my guy or whatever,</v>

2967
02:43:08.041 --> 02:43:11.240
and you're up against some dumb ass eight will be valuable.
Sure.

2968
02:43:11.241 --> 02:43:12.160
What if you're up against

2969
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:14.020
<v 3>a trained fighter,
you're going to be a lot of trouble.</v>

2970
02:43:14.050 --> 02:43:16.210
<v 0>Well,
you should always prepare for a trained fighter.</v>

2971
02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:21.240
And that's the difference between like the street systems versus real MMA,

2972
02:43:22.090 --> 02:43:24.650
like real MMA.
So stuff that works.
It's,

2973
02:43:24.651 --> 02:43:29.651
it's the best application the human body has when it comes to using your body in

2974
02:43:29.711 --> 02:43:31.510
a combat sports scenario.
It's the best.

2975
02:43:31.720 --> 02:43:34.660
That's the reason why you don't see Kung Fu in MMA.
I mean,

2976
02:43:34.930 --> 02:43:38.950
Roy Nelson Jokingly Calls Himself a Kung foo fighter and I know he has actually

2977
02:43:38.951 --> 02:43:40.570
done some Kung Fu training,

2978
02:43:40.810 --> 02:43:43.870
but the reality is Roy's throwing a fucking heavy overhand right.

2979
02:43:44.110 --> 02:43:46.070
He's got a black belt in Jujitsu to back it up.

2980
02:43:46.180 --> 02:43:49.600
<v 3>Yeah,
exactly.
And,
uh,
if,
I mean,
hey,
if,</v>

2981
02:43:49.630 --> 02:43:53.500
if for whatever reason you like wearing a kung fu outfit and doing all this

2982
02:43:53.501 --> 02:43:55.970
stuff,
it makes you feel good fucking gold train it for sure.
Yeah,

2983
02:43:56.020 --> 02:44:01.020
but don't try to tell professional athletes and people who would analyze it all

2984
02:44:01.030 --> 02:44:02.980
day every day that this thing is going to be the thing.

2985
02:44:03.130 --> 02:44:06.040
Because why the fuck isn't George Saint Pierre using it?
George,

2986
02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:10.030
he told me one time that he just,
he said,
damn shirts.

2987
02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:14.320
It happens to you a lot too,
that people come up to him and say,
Hey George,

2988
02:44:14.321 --> 02:44:18.370
you know,
a,
a,
a,
you do really good man.
Hey,
we should try it together.

2989
02:44:18.371 --> 02:44:21.280
I Have Kung Fu studio down the street and they would literally,

2990
02:44:21.281 --> 02:44:22.450
I can teach you some shit.

2991
02:44:22.780 --> 02:44:27.700
And really literally believe now when they're talking to the greatest fighter in

2992
02:44:27.701 --> 02:44:32.701
the world at the time that they got some secret shit back on the unsafe Denise

2993
02:44:33.070 --> 02:44:36.020
Street and Quebec and Montreal that he could teach short St Vr.

2994
02:44:36.190 --> 02:44:37.590
This got really fucking believes that

2995
02:44:37.660 --> 02:44:39.370
<v 0>they really believed the got some death touch.</v>

2996
02:44:39.371 --> 02:44:40.870
They're going to pull out and George is going to go,

2997
02:44:41.050 --> 02:44:42.880
this is going to change my whole career.

2998
02:44:43.270 --> 02:44:46.120
Thank you for teaching me death touch that she has got to happen to you too,

2999
02:44:46.121 --> 02:44:46.960
right?
Oh yeah.

3000
02:44:46.961 --> 02:44:49.450
Well there's always some guy that says that he has some new thing that no one's

3001
02:44:49.451 --> 02:44:50.380
ever seen before.

3002
02:44:50.381 --> 02:44:54.280
He has his master can't be defeated or there's a bunch of knuckleheads out
there,

3003
02:44:54.281 --> 02:44:58.270
man.
It was about,
but George is an amazingly patient guy.

3004
02:44:58.300 --> 02:45:01.000
I've seen George deal with a lot of fucking people.

3005
02:45:01.210 --> 02:45:06.210
He's a then one of the nicest guys ever reached like a super high level of any

3006
02:45:06.911 --> 02:45:10.910
combat sport and really open minded like he'll listen to it.
Yeah,

3007
02:45:11.110 --> 02:45:13.090
I've seen him exchange techniques with people.
Yeah,

3008
02:45:13.130 --> 02:45:16.690
<v 3>I saw him turning side kick with many of his Nilo.
Yeah,</v>

3009
02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:19.550
he's using his knee low and without questioning,

3010
02:45:19.551 --> 02:45:23.980
train fucking taekwondo for 10 years competing all over.
That's how you do this.

3011
02:45:24.060 --> 02:45:26.710
A turning sidekick and he got any understood that?

3012
02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:27.930
<v 0>Yeah.
Well it was out.</v>

3013
02:45:28.060 --> 02:45:32.680
That was a weird moment because John Danaher was a friend of mine was talking

3014
02:45:32.681 --> 02:45:36.640
and we were out to eat after a fight.
Me,
him and Eddie.
And uh,
he said,

3015
02:45:36.641 --> 02:45:38.980
do you guys know any good taekwondo guys?

3016
02:45:38.981 --> 02:45:42.220
George wants to work on the mechanics of a spinning back kick.
And I said,

3017
02:45:42.221 --> 02:45:44.110
this is going to sound so stupid,

3018
02:45:44.440 --> 02:45:48.070
but I have to say it like I have a great spinning back kick like my spinning

3019
02:45:48.071 --> 02:45:51.280
back kick.
I really know how to do it better than anybody.
And you know,

3020
02:45:51.281 --> 02:45:53.540
you say that and people go get the fuck out of here.

3021
02:45:54.010 --> 02:45:55.850
Lifetime martial arts expert.

3022
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:59.770
But you still okay because I'm a comedian and a fucking a commentator.

3023
02:45:59.771 --> 02:46:02.770
I'm not a fighter.
You know,
I mean that those days are long gone.

3024
02:46:02.771 --> 02:46:07.210
But that doesn't mean that a lifetime mastery of a technique isn't.

3025
02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:10.910
And that's true,
but so many people have ridiculous egos.
There's so many,

3026
02:46:10.911 --> 02:46:12.020
and I'm not going to name any names,

3027
02:46:12.021 --> 02:46:14.840
but I know a lot of guys that are involved in the same sort of thing that I'm

3028
02:46:14.841 --> 02:46:15.350
involved in.

3029
02:46:15.350 --> 02:46:17.930
They'll tell you that they're great and then you train with and you're like,

3030
02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:22.220
Oh fucking Christ,
I'm wasting my time.
So I had this moment where I was like,

3031
02:46:22.490 --> 02:46:26.690
tell George if he wants to train on.
And then Eddie told him like,
dude,
seriously,

3032
02:46:26.691 --> 02:46:29.240
you gotta see this Guy Kick?
And I'm like,
this sounds so stupid.

3033
02:46:29.241 --> 02:46:33.870
Like no one's gonna believe me.
And so then George showed up.
So I was,

3034
02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:37.790
I was hoping,
you know,
when George showed up like that,
he wasn't like,
go,
okay,

3035
02:46:37.791 --> 02:46:42.200
come on,
show me,
you know,
this is stupid.
Why am I wasting my time?
Well,

3036
02:46:42.201 --> 02:46:47.030
once I kicked the bag once and then he went,
oh shit,
like this is real.

3037
02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:49.800
And then you could see like,
like he got this,
like,

3038
02:46:49.850 --> 02:46:52.460
I'm actually going to get something out of this as opposed to like,

3039
02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:56.990
I'm just being nice to Joe because we're friends and I'm going to go humor him.

3040
02:46:56.991 --> 02:46:59.410
And you know,
he's gonna throw some pussy ass kicks,

3041
02:46:59.860 --> 02:47:02.020
right when he saw me kick a bag,
you know when you hit,

3042
02:47:02.021 --> 02:47:05.390
he kick a 200 pound bag and it goes fine.
And then it puts it in your head.

3043
02:47:05.391 --> 02:47:09.080
You Go,
oh,
I get it.
I get it now.
But it was,

3044
02:47:09.081 --> 02:47:12.920
his open mindedness was so impressive because I wouldn't have listened to me.

3045
02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:15.440
I would've been like,
bitch,
get the fuck outta here.

3046
02:47:15.910 --> 02:47:17.990
<v 4>Like George is going to give you advice on your job.</v>

3047
02:47:18.230 --> 02:47:22.940
Exactly what I maybe exactly,
you know,
if you have an open mind.
But uh,
I uh,

3048
02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:25.610
when I did that TV show where I was learning to fight,

3049
02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:29.480
I trained with George and we do sat on the show and I was terrible.
Like,

3050
02:47:29.481 --> 02:47:32.660
I mean I literally was trying to take,

3051
02:47:33.020 --> 02:47:36.830
to play doing taekwondo growing up and add kind of boxing my head.

3052
02:47:36.860 --> 02:47:40.010
Like I'm a fucking horrible and I had never wrestled Dave my life,

3053
02:47:40.011 --> 02:47:43.670
I was doing Jiu Jitsu like 10 times a week for whatever number of months.
Never.

3054
02:47:44.030 --> 02:47:46.810
And that will forever people will just put that on goal.

3055
02:47:47.030 --> 02:47:51.260
Fuck this guy's terrible.
And it is bad.
But I mean,

3056
02:47:51.261 --> 02:47:55.310
what the fuck you're doing a TV show by taking some guy who wears eye makeup and

3057
02:47:55.311 --> 02:47:58.070
trying to teach him to fight.
He happened to be there.
And with Georgia course,

3058
02:47:58.071 --> 02:48:00.770
he's terrible.
You know,
you know the beautiful

3059
02:48:00.770 --> 02:48:04.190
<v 0>thing about martial arts or any difficult endeavor is that you start off,</v>

3060
02:48:04.220 --> 02:48:08.270
everybody starts off,
they sabal.
If you don't have those techniques,

3061
02:48:08.271 --> 02:48:10.580
you don't know what you're doing,
you're not going to be good.

3062
02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:14.170
And then as you train,
you get better.
And when you get better,

3063
02:48:14.370 --> 02:48:18.650
it's like you go down a path and then you can stop and pause and look back in

3064
02:48:18.651 --> 02:48:19.520
the look.
When I started,

3065
02:48:19.521 --> 02:48:22.580
I started way back then and now here I am getting better and then you turn

3066
02:48:22.581 --> 02:48:25.790
around and go,
but look how far I got to go.
And that's exciting.
Yeah,

3067
02:48:25.791 --> 02:48:29.330
well that's the beautiful thing about martial arts is that there are so many

3068
02:48:29.331 --> 02:48:34.331
levels and when we're seeing in mixed martial arts is like the Jujitsu is still

3069
02:48:34.521 --> 02:48:35.810
at a fairly low level.

3070
02:48:36.110 --> 02:48:40.220
I think that you do to still like purple belt level at even like a high level.

3071
02:48:40.221 --> 02:48:43.760
It's not like Marcello Garcia,
like high level black belt.

3072
02:48:43.850 --> 02:48:47.870
The striking is still at a fairly low level.
We're not singing Ernesto hoost yet.

3073
02:48:48.050 --> 02:48:51.080
We're not seeing these like ridiculously technical,

3074
02:48:51.081 --> 02:48:55.130
absolutely perfect executions of striking technique.
We're getting closer,

3075
02:48:55.310 --> 02:48:57.830
we're getting closer with the Jujitsu.
We're getting closer with a striking,

3076
02:48:58.040 --> 02:48:59.150
but there's room to grow.

3077
02:48:59.270 --> 02:49:02.300
And that's one of the reasons why we're seeing new techniques now.

3078
02:49:02.301 --> 02:49:04.400
Like how many people are throwing wheel kicks now?

3079
02:49:04.430 --> 02:49:08.040
There was no wheel kicks up until Terry Adams fought Ed Barboza.

3080
02:49:08.330 --> 02:49:13.280
<v 4>But you know,
there was a,
there was a,
um,
uh,
like this has been,</v>

3081
02:49:13.281 --> 02:49:14.440
has this been seen before?

3082
02:49:14.530 --> 02:49:18.910
<v 5>Like when Tony Hawk did the four things,
right?
Yeah.
Right,
right.
Within a year,</v>

3083
02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:23.560
10 guys could do and get it into training the quad and,
and figure skating.

3084
02:49:23.650 --> 02:49:24.580
Nobody could do it.

3085
02:49:24.730 --> 02:49:28.510
Now if I can college level figure skaters through the quad because a four minute

3086
02:49:28.511 --> 02:49:30.610
mile.
Yeah,
yeah.
When it happens once,

3087
02:49:30.830 --> 02:49:35.780
<v 4>suddenly it's now real humans do this just because,
I mean,</v>

3088
02:49:35.781 --> 02:49:38.750
just cause that guy did it,
not every guy thinks he can do it,

3089
02:49:38.840 --> 02:49:39.770
but some guys think that,

3090
02:49:39.850 --> 02:49:43.900
<v 5>yeah,
it's an amazing thing to watch the actual growth.
I love it.</v>

3091
02:49:43.901 --> 02:49:46.510
I'm so fascinated too,
man.
Me Too.

3092
02:49:46.511 --> 02:49:49.810
It's such a cool aspect of of martial arts to be there.

3093
02:49:49.811 --> 02:49:52.300
While this is all going down and see this,

3094
02:49:52.570 --> 02:49:57.130
this thing evolving and getting better front kicks to the face now and same

3095
02:49:57.131 --> 02:49:59.590
thing.
All of a sudden there was the quad in figure skating.

3096
02:49:59.591 --> 02:50:02.800
They're all due at front.
The front kicks in play for almost every good striker.

3097
02:50:02.801 --> 02:50:04.160
Now that's in play for,

3098
02:50:04.161 --> 02:50:08.850
we've also seen a lot of that sideways karate stance like Ryan Jimmo does and

3099
02:50:08.890 --> 02:50:13.360
Gunnar Nelson does and Leotta does that sideways karate stance is a totally

3100
02:50:13.361 --> 02:50:14.194
different thing.

3101
02:50:14.430 --> 02:50:17.910
<v 4>Some guys you see are using it.
They grew up,</v>

3102
02:50:17.911 --> 02:50:22.290
you use again and when they are and for a right handed guy it's whenever they

3103
02:50:22.291 --> 02:50:26.160
switch the stance and the right foot is in the front is when you're going to see

3104
02:50:26.161 --> 02:50:30.150
it.
You know what I mean?
Like it's,
it's suddenly like not as camouflaged anymore.

3105
02:50:30.180 --> 02:50:32.460
Not only are guys using it,
but it's like,
oh shit,
he's in that stance.

3106
02:50:32.461 --> 02:50:33.070
I better watch it.

3107
02:50:33.070 --> 02:50:37.320
<v 5>Do you see a lot of front leg kicks off the the dominant stance leg dominant
leg?</v>

3108
02:50:37.350 --> 02:50:38.980
Yeah.
There's not a lot of guys.

3109
02:50:38.981 --> 02:50:41.280
She developed that powerful front leg left sidekick.

3110
02:50:41.281 --> 02:50:45.330
They develop it off the right leg.
Do you remember when Chris Clements did a,

3111
02:50:45.510 --> 02:50:48.510
did a spinning thing on that?
I brought that down.
Yeah.

3112
02:50:48.610 --> 02:50:52.270
<v 4>The big question people had was how did he know to do that?</v>

3113
02:50:52.450 --> 02:50:54.430
And when you look at it,
you see wonder why,

3114
02:50:54.431 --> 02:50:57.220
and he turned sideways and Chris and Mia and I froze and said,
look at,

3115
02:50:57.221 --> 02:51:00.670
here they are.
This is a mock.
Chris grew up doing taekwondo.

3116
02:51:00.730 --> 02:51:02.470
Christmas about tradition Marshall as well,

3117
02:51:02.471 --> 02:51:05.870
so he knows when this right leg comes forward and the stance is distributed this

3118
02:51:05.871 --> 02:51:07.690
way.
Neither a sidekick is coming,

3119
02:51:07.691 --> 02:51:10.990
oral hook kick is coming or around [inaudible] round kick in and it was,

3120
02:51:10.991 --> 02:51:14.590
the hip was flared enough.
Then he split.
It was probably you didn't,

3121
02:51:14.591 --> 02:51:18.430
it was the round kick wasn't as in play because of the position of how far his

3122
02:51:18.431 --> 02:51:19.264
shoulder or hip was.

3123
02:51:19.690 --> 02:51:22.990
So then we freeze it said that's what he knows what he knows from a lifetime of

3124
02:51:22.991 --> 02:51:25.240
that,
that both of those were in play.
Now what?
Let's watch it,

3125
02:51:25.241 --> 02:51:26.650
throws the sidekick and got freeze.

3126
02:51:27.310 --> 02:51:31.000
Now Chris had his mind would know if this still happens,
the next option,

3127
02:51:31.001 --> 02:51:32.410
since he's just giving me a sidekick,

3128
02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:35.260
his point is hoping to drop my hands and Hook,
kick me in the hat.

3129
02:51:35.590 --> 02:51:38.800
When he saw that happen,
there was a little flair of the hip and his brain goes,

3130
02:51:39.130 --> 02:51:41.800
oh yeah,
that's coming.
And then he timed it on the hook kick.

3131
02:51:41.980 --> 02:51:45.490
But it was his ability to kind of see the future,
you know what I mean?

3132
02:51:45.491 --> 02:51:48.710
Like he could he and we predict the future all the time.
Yeah.

3133
02:51:48.760 --> 02:51:50.170
When you go to open a door handle,

3134
02:51:50.350 --> 02:51:54.310
the reason if it was really hot or if it was spongy that you'd be surprised is

3135
02:51:54.311 --> 02:51:56.860
because your brain was predicting what a door handle would feel like.

3136
02:51:57.050 --> 02:52:00.260
<v 5>Yeah.
And that's what you were talking about earlier when it comes to pattern</v>

3137
02:52:00.261 --> 02:52:04.520
recognition that that's a big thing for pattern recognition.
Yeah,
it is.

3138
02:52:05.050 --> 02:52:06.040
Yeah.
And it's definitely

3139
02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:10.420
<v 4>what guys are playing with.
Like,
um,
how do you know Adam?
A zoo?</v>

3140
02:52:10.421 --> 02:52:12.070
Check he trans Sarah Kaufman,

3141
02:52:12.071 --> 02:52:15.550
but he's also kind of a secret weapon for Greg Jackson.
He's up in Victoria,

3142
02:52:15.551 --> 02:52:19.540
BC and he sends guys up there to do certain things with very talented and we

3143
02:52:19.541 --> 02:52:24.250
were talking about after Sarah's fight coffins fight her last one in Quebec

3144
02:52:24.251 --> 02:52:24.820
city.

3145
02:52:24.820 --> 02:52:28.270
She was throwing a lot of off tempo things which he taught her cause she's a

3146
02:52:28.271 --> 02:52:29.170
dancer.
All right?

3147
02:52:29.171 --> 02:52:33.960
So he can work footwork off time and risk different rhythms with her.
But uh,

3148
02:52:34.480 --> 02:52:38.320
uh,
he was also talking about pattern recognition and how him and Greg Jackson,

3149
02:52:38.321 --> 02:52:43.150
that's one of the things there are on heavy is training you to expect certain

3150
02:52:43.151 --> 02:52:43.810
patterns,

3151
02:52:43.810 --> 02:52:47.380
chunking those patterns that your brain anticipates and then giving you a

3152
02:52:47.381 --> 02:52:51.850
surprise.
And that's on the front end of some of their thinking right now.
So far.

3153
02:52:51.870 --> 02:52:52.770
Slack.
Yeah man,
I need,

3154
02:52:53.220 --> 02:52:57.280
and then what's so cool is when you have that many great minds doing it,

3155
02:52:57.610 --> 02:53:00.610
now you've got one of these guys thinking that,
but you've got Duane over here.

3156
02:53:01.010 --> 02:53:04.970
<v 5>Let's go over there and there's all these different guys in there.
And the group.</v>

3157
02:53:04.990 --> 02:53:08.990
This is in Wisconsin and he's looking at it and trying to break it down and put

3158
02:53:08.991 --> 02:53:11.630
them against each other and the lessons that we learned there.

3159
02:53:11.930 --> 02:53:15.260
Everybody's going to go back in their labs and prepare for the next one.
Yeah,

3160
02:53:15.320 --> 02:53:18.470
amazing stuff,
dude.
We're out of time.
This is a lot of fun.
Thank you,
Robin.

3161
02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:22.070
Thank you for having me.

and thanks for digging my stuff.

I appreciate that you're doing it.

3163

m m a on Twitter and a where can people see the videos?

3170
02:53:43.750 --> 02:53:46.330
