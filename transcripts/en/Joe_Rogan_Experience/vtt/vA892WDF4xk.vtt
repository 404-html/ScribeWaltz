00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.823
<v Speaker 1>Part two folks.</v>

10
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.710
<v Speaker 1>If you hated part one,</v>

11
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.610
<v Speaker 1>this one's going to be worse.</v>

12
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:09.661
<v Speaker 1>Worse,</v>

13
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:10.494
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

14
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh fucking hate to show.</v>

15
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.920
<v Speaker 1>You know what my favorite is when people go fucking shows change man.</v>

16
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>You used to used to fucking be more open minded.</v>

17
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 1>People Change.</v>

19
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Do you want me to do man,</v>

20
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I changed.</v>

21
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>I changed over five years.</v>

22
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Everyone change.</v>

23
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into fucking Lego's and video games,</v>

24
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:28.711
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

25
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:29.544
<v Speaker 1>I grew up.</v>

26
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I definitely don't think I'm less open minded though.</v>

27
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely less tolerant for stupid shit though.</v>

28
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I just think I've heard it too many times now.</v>

29
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

30
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>

31
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

32
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not doing anybody any good stock.</v>

33
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>He cut out the bullshit.</v>

34
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Well I cut out like conspiracy bullshit and religious bullshit.</v>

35
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:46.314
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

36
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't mean that I,</v>

37
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

38
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not willing to consider people's points of view,</v>

39
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:55.760
<v Speaker 1>but certain certain things just at a certain point in time like keep,</v>

40
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.730
<v Speaker 1>can't keep refreshing them shimmy over and over again.</v>

41
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>You know when it gets a certain point in time,</v>

42
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>like for instance,</v>

43
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

44
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>like Ufos.</v>

45
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.501
<v Speaker 1>Do?</v>

46
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>I think the UFOS are real.</v>

47
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>It's totally possible if we can put a satellite around the earth,</v>

48
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.570
<v Speaker 1>it's very possible at some advanced life form consent.</v>

49
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>The spaceship here from another galaxy.</v>

50
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Have I seen anything that makes me believe that it's actually helped?</v>

51
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Proof?</v>

52
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

53
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>So when you don't share that opinion,</v>

54
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 1>when you're absolutely convinced that the government is hiding details and like,</v>

55
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

56
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.700
<v Speaker 1>what makes you really want to believe this?</v>

57
00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Because you're not saying this based on some hardcore shit.</v>

58
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Like I know that if you take this plastic and you put it over fire,</v>

59
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.270
<v Speaker 1>oops,</v>

60
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.103
<v Speaker 1>did I fuck that up?</v>

61
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 1>If we take this plastic,</v>

62
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:42.444
<v Speaker 1>how did I do that?</v>

63
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.343
<v Speaker 1>Exit.</v>

64
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Take this plastic.</v>

65
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.031
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

66
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:45.721
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

67
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:46.554
<v Speaker 1>You can't</v>

68
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.890
<v Speaker 1>watch it now.</v>

69
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.733
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

70
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>If you take this plastic and put it over fire,</v>

71
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

72
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>

73
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>They're playing this again.</v>

74
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing here?</v>

75
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I didn't start this from the beginning.</v>

76
00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Did I know that's a filler for rain?</v>

77
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.430
<v Speaker 1>They're showing this fight again.</v>

78
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 1>The old filler fight.</v>

79
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

80
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:04.584
<v Speaker 1>we watched all,</v>

81
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>we already watched his fight.</v>

82
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Do we watch on the video?</v>

83
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.641
<v Speaker 1>Was this on the,</v>

84
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:09.090

<v Speaker 1>So I guess we watched this again.</v>

90
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Can you do,</v>

91
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.783
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm wrong.</v>

92
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Is this a tournament?</v>

93
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.581
<v Speaker 1>It's not a toy.</v>

94
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:20.821
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

95
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:21.601

00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:32.530

109
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Look at his training in the back.</v>

110

<v Speaker 3>especially on this platform then from anyone else.</v>

<v Speaker 3>things have just got too crazy man.</v>

187
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.920

00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:39.970
<v Speaker 3>I got this on a big network that I can't talk about till it's done.</v>

193
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:40.840

197
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.350
<v Speaker 3>I got to step away from the game,</v>

198
00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:45.581
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

199
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:47.440
<v Speaker 3>I gotta step away from the UFC for right now.</v>

200
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 3>You know what I love about fighting?</v>

201
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:49.811
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about this,</v>

202
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 3>that you could just say,</v>

203
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to retire.</v>

204
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 3>And then you could say like in a week from now I'm unretired and then a week</v>

205
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 3>later you could say retired again.</v>

206
00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

207
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.730
<v Speaker 3>you could go back and forth for sure.</v>

208
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:01.421
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

209
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 3>thinking about sugar Ray Leonard,</v>

210
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.900
<v Speaker 3>how many times does a coal miner retire?</v>

211
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.260
<v Speaker 3>Usually once she won sugar ray Leonard.</v>

212
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 3>No tired.</v>

213
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.320
<v Speaker 3>Like a half a dozen fucking time.</v>

214
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 3>Get it with fighters,</v>

215
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:10.691
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

216
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:11.710
<v Speaker 3>But for me,</v>

217
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

218
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

219
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 3>I talked to my family and close friends and you were one of them and Callan and</v>

220
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.661
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

221
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:17.494
<v Speaker 3>my dad and,</v>

222
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.513
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

223
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.241
<v Speaker 3>going through it,</v>

224
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:19.461
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

225
00:05:19.461 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 3>it just do I want one more?</v>

226
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yes man.</v>

227
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:23.404
<v Speaker 3>But it just,</v>

228
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.330
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make sense.</v>

229
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:25.530
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

230

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 3>I can't see myself in it when it comes down.</v>

232
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:28.601
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

233
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 3>I can't see myself in a fucking Reebok kit walking out to the octagon.</v>

234
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 3>I can't see myself being like,</v>

239
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:38.351
<v Speaker 3>I'm worth 10 grand.</v>

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>I gotta take a step away and focus on,</v>

266
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

267
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 1>this crazy fricking entertainment podcasts career I got going on,</v>

268
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:14.241
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

269
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm so blessed and that you are,</v>

270
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:17.030
<v Speaker 1>and I think that there's,</v>

271
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.060
<v Speaker 1>there's moments like that where like necessity becomes the mother of invention,</v>

272
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:27.120
<v Speaker 1>like necessity to figure out another way to generate income because the hundred</v>

273
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 1>thousand dollars you were making from sponsorships,</v>

274
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.140
<v Speaker 1>which is 100% real and legit and certified and authenticated,</v>

275
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.243
<v Speaker 1>proven,</v>

276
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of goddamn money you're missing out on every time you would</v>

277
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 1>compete.</v>

278
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>And so because of that,</v>

279
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.300
<v Speaker 1>it makes you concentrate and put even more effort into your podcast,</v>

280
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.143
<v Speaker 1>into your merchant said,</v>

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 1>This is insane,</v>

299
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:08.830
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

300
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 1>And now they want to do this tour and the the things are selling out.</v>

301
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.190
<v Speaker 1>It'd be tough when we say no,</v>

302
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:13.880
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

303
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Let me go fight some monster who's been training full time,</v>

304
00:07:17.031 --> 00:07:19.700
<v Speaker 1>not telling Dick Jokes and you know what I'm saying?</v>

305
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.700
<v Speaker 1>And selling fucking big brown shirts fulltime.</v>

306
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Let me go fight that guy.</v>

307
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do the game a disservice.</v>

308
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:26.510
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

309
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.170
<v Speaker 1>I want to do that.</v>

310
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.330
<v Speaker 1>So unless I could focus on it full time,</v>

311
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.090
<v Speaker 1>there's just no way and signing this Reebok deal,</v>

312
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to happen,</v>

313
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:33.710
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

314
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

315
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

316
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I completely understand where you're coming from when I've completely understand</v>

317
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:41.780
<v Speaker 1>the idea that if you're not a hundred percent focused on fighting,</v>

318
00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:43.160
<v Speaker 1>it's just not something you should do.</v>

319
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I've always told people that finding should be a singular pursuit.</v>

320
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I think it's unlike any other,</v>

321
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.400
<v Speaker 1>any other pursuit where if you're going to do it,</v>

322
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 1>you have to make sure that all your eggs are in that one basket.</v>

323
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think you could have one foot in the game,</v>

324
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:00.050
<v Speaker 1>one fund a foot out of the game.</v>

325
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:03.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it's real dangerous to do that with fighting and not be good.</v>

326
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

327
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Because you're going to fight some fucking guy who's all in and those all in</v>

328
00:08:07.371 --> 00:08:07.671
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

329
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:09.740
<v Speaker 1>all in murderers and they're out there.</v>

330
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Those all in guys,</v>

331
00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:11.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

332
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:15.730
<v Speaker 1>you want it to a rumble Johnson who's all in 100% man with no other option and</v>

333
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.290
<v Speaker 1>listened to me and people might beg to differ.</v>

334
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.490
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I've won,</v>

335
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:19.820
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

336
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.031
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

337
00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:20.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:20.800
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

339
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 1>I have no brain trauma that I know of and my,</v>

340
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.400
<v Speaker 1>my body's in good shape.</v>

341
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 1>I have this insane career right now with podcasts and the live shows and this</v>

342
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:32.970
<v Speaker 1>other Gig I get going on with TV and I feel like I've won.</v>

343
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.520
<v Speaker 1>And honestly I owe it to the UFC.</v>

344
00:08:34.521 --> 00:08:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

345
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:34.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm it,</v>

346
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm indebted to them forever.</v>

347
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:36.620
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

348
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

349
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

350
00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll always still watch every fight and who knows what happened in the future.</v>

351
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:41.780
<v Speaker 1>But for right now,</v>

352
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.510
<v Speaker 1>there's no way they could off meet anybody.</v>

353
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.403
<v Speaker 1>And there's no way,</v>

354
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I could put all this on hold holding be like,</v>

355
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:47.511
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

356
00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:48.530
<v Speaker 1>let me go take this flight.</v>

357
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:49.161
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

358
00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:52.520
<v Speaker 1>it would be hard because all this has been an investment in your time and it's</v>

359
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:53.690
<v Speaker 1>also been paying off.</v>

360
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 1>And it also was growing like considerably for people don't know,</v>

361
00:08:57.331 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>like your numbers.</v>

362
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Like I know where you guys were a year ago and two years ago and I know where</v>

363
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:03.624
<v Speaker 1>you are now and it's,</v>

364
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.740
<v Speaker 1>it's this crazy exponential thing where every month that comes up and up and up</v>

365
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Speaker 1>and up and up and it's because it's good.</v>

366
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.730
<v Speaker 1>And you guys got a weird dynamic,</v>

367
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:11.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

368
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>accounts.</v>

369
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking goof ball and,</v>

370
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.731
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

371
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:15.181
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

372
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 1>he's like a builtin joke all the time.</v>

373
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Like he'll always say something ridiculous and you two together are funny.</v>

374
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a funny group.</v>

375
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.960
<v Speaker 1>It's funny grouping.</v>

376
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.820
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting thing is what I'm doing.</v>

377
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:27.421
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>

378
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:30.270
<v Speaker 1>my two advisers or Joe Rogan and Brian Cowen.</v>

379
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

380
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

381
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I get the Mount Rushmore.</v>

382
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:34.440
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

383
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Guys who have have done shit who are saying for sure listen to me and not him.</v>

384
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.301
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

385
00:09:38.301 --> 00:09:39.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming right now real quick.</v>

386
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

387
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.510
<v Speaker 1>that's me being friendly to Callan.</v>

388
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it'd probably be challenge,</v>

389
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that will get some fucking God damn horrible advice could be</v>

390
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:48.870
<v Speaker 1>selling used electronics,</v>

391
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:49.351
<v Speaker 1>fighting a kid,</v>

392
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:50.550
<v Speaker 1>use electronics class.</v>

393
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Tallon was advising this fucking thing.</v>

394
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.530
<v Speaker 1>You want to open the pawn store?</v>

395
00:09:53.531 --> 00:09:54.331
<v Speaker 1>That's a different story.</v>

396
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

397
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.380
<v Speaker 1>what store a pond like,</v>

398
00:09:57.381 --> 00:09:57.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

399
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.800
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

400
00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.080
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

401
00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.913
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

402
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.050
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking one stars.</v>

403
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:01.710
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

404
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:01.861
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

405
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:02.330
<v Speaker 1>pawn.</v>

406
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

407
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 1>for real.</v>

408
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.840
<v Speaker 1>For Real.</v>

409
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

410
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:05.550
<v Speaker 1>This is the one that idea,</v>

411
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.170
<v Speaker 1>I thought you said a pond.</v>

412
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:08.004
<v Speaker 1>Like he wants to open up.</v>

413
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

414
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Five kids funds.</v>

415
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.113
<v Speaker 1>That's really,</v>

416
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.920
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird way of looking at things.</v>

417
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe people like ponds you wanted to sell are going off,</v>

418
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:18.774
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

419
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

420
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.110
<v Speaker 1>blessed this fight is fucking crazy.</v>

421
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

422
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

423
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:25.801
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

424
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:27.330
<v Speaker 1>so long story short,</v>

425
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm stepping away from the game and there's going to be no shab Reebok kits out</v>

426
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

427
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not finding when,</v>

428
00:10:33.181 --> 00:10:34.020
<v Speaker 1>anytime soon.</v>

429
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Did they ever make a shrub Reebok kit?</v>

430
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Can I get one like as like a a collector's item?</v>

431
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.900
<v Speaker 1>I think they did for like a week and then I came out and just talked all this</v>

432
00:10:41.901 --> 00:10:42.361
<v Speaker 1>shit and I'm like,</v>

433
00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:42.811
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

434
00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:43.500
<v Speaker 1>pull that shit down.</v>

435
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Pull that shit down right now.</v>

436
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Did anybody buy one?</v>

437
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Do you get any money from those?</v>

438
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably like 14 cents or some shit.</v>

439
00:10:49.951 --> 00:10:50.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the deal,</v>

440
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.320
<v Speaker 1>but it sure as fuck.</v>

441
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Not as much as selling my own shit.</v>

442
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.001
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

443
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:55.050
<v Speaker 1>oh well no,</v>

444
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.610
<v Speaker 1>because then you get all,</v>

445
00:10:56.611 --> 00:10:57.380
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

446
00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.100
<v Speaker 1>And we just released shirt and I made,</v>

447
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

448
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing good,</v>

449
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:05.400
<v Speaker 1>doing good,</v>

450
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.540
<v Speaker 1>everything's Nice.</v>

451
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.580
<v Speaker 1>There's no need to be struggling.</v>

452
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 1>There's no one's struck more shirts than Reebok kits.</v>

453
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.031
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

454
00:11:12.031 --> 00:11:12.870
<v Speaker 1>here's the reality,</v>

455
00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:13.441
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

456
00:11:13.441 --> 00:11:15.510
<v Speaker 1>what you've done is a real show.</v>

457
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:16.501
<v Speaker 1>It's a real show.</v>

458
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:19.830
<v Speaker 1>It's just like having a TV show and people don't think it's TV show because it's</v>

459
00:11:19.831 --> 00:11:22.320
<v Speaker 1>not on NBC or CBS or Fox,</v>

460
00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:23.154
<v Speaker 1>but it's the same guy.</v>

461
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.180
<v Speaker 1>They'll be,</v>

462
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.090
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're filming.</v>

463
00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.880
<v Speaker 1>November's not supposed to say.</v>

464
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.031
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

465
00:11:27.031 --> 00:11:27.631
<v Speaker 1>I can say that.</v>

466
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:28.081
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

467
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:28.500
<v Speaker 1>that's all.</v>

468
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.550
<v Speaker 1>We start shooting November.</v>

469
00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:30.211
<v Speaker 1>We have the director,</v>

470
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:30.901
<v Speaker 1>the production team,</v>

471
00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:32.090
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're doing right in APP.</v>

472
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

473
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a show like,</v>

474
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.420
<v Speaker 1>like it's a successful entertainment vehicle.</v>

475
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:40.470
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is,</v>

476
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

477
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.260
<v Speaker 1>and that's what podcasts are and they don't,</v>

478
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.230
<v Speaker 1>they seem like they're horse shit and people are used to make fun of them</v>

479
00:11:46.231 --> 00:11:46.860
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

480
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

481
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:47.671
<v Speaker 1>Howard Stern,</v>

482
00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:49.440
<v Speaker 1>before he got into that thing with Ari,</v>

483
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.450
<v Speaker 1>he made fun of a podcast.</v>

484
00:11:51.451 --> 00:11:52.950
<v Speaker 1>When Adam Carolla came on his show,</v>

485
00:11:52.951 --> 00:11:53.381
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

486
00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:53.620
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

487
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.090
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>

488
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.080
<v Speaker 3>are you hurting for money?</v>

489
00:11:55.081 --> 00:11:55.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

490
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.100
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>

491
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.410
<v Speaker 3>Know Adam Carolla owns a fucking giant warehouse.</v>

492
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 3>He's got like 10 different podcasts running simultaneously.</v>

493
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.090
<v Speaker 3>Raking it in.</v>

494
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.290
<v Speaker 3>People are threatened by it.</v>

495
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:05.501
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

496
00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:08.050
<v Speaker 3>And also the thing with podcasts and there's no,</v>

497
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.990
<v Speaker 3>there's no kind of standard to start a podcast.</v>

498
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:12.610
<v Speaker 3>So if Joe Schmoe and start when he can stolen.</v>

499
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.230
<v Speaker 3>So there's a ton of them out there.</v>

500
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 3>There's some fucking awesome podcasts,</v>

501
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:17.320
<v Speaker 3>but just like anything,</v>

502
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:17.950
<v Speaker 3>there's just,</v>

503
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.690
<v Speaker 3>there's a ton of shitty radio shows out there.</v>

504
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 3>There's a ton of Shitty TV out there,</v>

505
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 3>but there's a bunch of good content out there,</v>

506
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:24.530
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

507
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.140
<v Speaker 3>100% there's some real good ones.</v>

508
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:26.441
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

509
00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:27.274
<v Speaker 3>This dude in the white,</v>

510
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 3>he keeps landing those fucking leg kicks on.</v>

511
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 3>This dude,</v>

512
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.301
<v Speaker 3>the other guy's name,</v>

513
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:34.660
<v Speaker 3>his willingness to dam the will is wellness on the right.</v>

514
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.970
<v Speaker 3>Basic ass basketball shorts.</v>

515
00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:37.540
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

516
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.373
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

517
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:39.940
<v Speaker 3>He didn't get the Reebok kiss.</v>

518
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:43.610
<v Speaker 3>Give me those eighth grade basketball are kicking the shit out of each other's</v>

519
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.110
<v Speaker 3>legs.</v>

520
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.943
<v Speaker 3>Straight up.</v>

521
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.380
<v Speaker 3>It's hurting my legs just watching this.</v>

522
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh boom.</v>

523
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.183
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

524
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.083
<v Speaker 3>huge left hook.</v>

525
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.060
<v Speaker 3>This is a good fight,</v>

526
00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:53.430
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

527
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:54.100
<v Speaker 3>Fight,</v>

528
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.600
<v Speaker 3>but they're standing right in front of each other.</v>

529
00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:56.920
<v Speaker 3>This is an MMA fight for sure.</v>

530
00:12:56.921 --> 00:12:58.420
<v Speaker 3>Someone would be in half guard right now,</v>

531
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.850
<v Speaker 3>which I prefer.</v>

532
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:01.811
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

533
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:02.291
<v Speaker 3>it's weird,</v>

534
00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:02.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

535
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.633
<v Speaker 3>That they,</v>

536
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.800
<v Speaker 3>it's MMA really is the perfect sport because as cool as this is to watch guys go</v>

537
00:13:08.801 --> 00:13:10.630
<v Speaker 3>off and Stan and strike,</v>

538
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.330
<v Speaker 3>the reality is there's so open for takedowns.</v>

539
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:14.800
<v Speaker 3>It's not realistic.</v>

540
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:15.910
<v Speaker 3>It's not a real fight.</v>

541
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:16.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

542
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.110
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

543
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.943
<v Speaker 3>It's a difference.</v>

544
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.990
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like a smells like fish.</v>

545
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.100
<v Speaker 3>It is a fight,</v>

546
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.480
<v Speaker 3>but it's a kickboxing fight.</v>

547
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 3>It's a fight with a,</v>

548
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.930
<v Speaker 3>with a set agenda,</v>

549
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.890
<v Speaker 3>like a fight fight.</v>

550
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.030
<v Speaker 3>Some shit's going to go down.</v>

551
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.260
<v Speaker 3>We might go to the ground,</v>

552
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:29.980
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

553
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.730
<v Speaker 3>That's why still love the UFC three minutes as opposed to five minutes.</v>

554
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:37.270
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of interesting because it's easier to stand and strike like cardio</v>

555
00:13:37.271 --> 00:13:40.180
<v Speaker 3>wise than it is to grapple and strike at the same time.</v>

556
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.830
<v Speaker 3>The only different differences.</v>

557
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 3>If we grapple,</v>

558
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.770
<v Speaker 3>I can get breaks.</v>

559
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

560
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.151
<v Speaker 3>What did you fight in?</v>

561
00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:46.984
<v Speaker 3>Cane.</v>

562
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.580
<v Speaker 3>There's no breaks.</v>

563
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.590
<v Speaker 3>That's how Cain breaks dudes.</v>

564
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 3>True breaks you because it's going to take some breaks though.</v>

565
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:54.071
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

566
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:54.851
<v Speaker 3>I did Max.</v>

567
00:13:54.851 --> 00:13:58.820
<v Speaker 3>It's around when he's balls deep in your Chin with his head dead five that</v>

568
00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.440
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked and he's like taking a second off things,</v>

569
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:02.530
<v Speaker 3>going back to beat your brains.</v>

570
00:14:02.531 --> 00:14:06.130
<v Speaker 3>In Junior dos Santos taking tiny little breaks.</v>

571
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:06.701
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

572
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:08.170
<v Speaker 3>he's taking years away from your life.</v>

573
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.580
<v Speaker 3>He's definitely incentives like,</v>

574
00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:10.270
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>

575
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.103
<v Speaker 3>That's the same dude.</v>

576
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:11.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

577
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:13.120
<v Speaker 3>you're bat shit crazy thing.</v>

578
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the same thing that he's the same dude after that fight with our DCO.</v>

579
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

580
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:19.240
<v Speaker 3>I've heard,</v>

581
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.460
<v Speaker 3>I've heard a lot of things were,</v>

582
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

583
00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:21.970
<v Speaker 3>came to have the great camp.</v>

584
00:14:21.971 --> 00:14:22.631
<v Speaker 3>He didn't get there.</v>

585
00:14:22.631 --> 00:14:22.871
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

586
00:14:22.871 --> 00:14:23.531
<v Speaker 3>I've heard a tenant,</v>

587
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:24.970
<v Speaker 3>we didn't get there early enough.</v>

588
00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Correct?</v>

589
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:26.650
<v Speaker 3>It's still got his ass.</v>

590
00:14:26.651 --> 00:14:26.980
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

591
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

592
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.090
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

593
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:28.311
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

594
00:14:28.311 --> 00:14:28.720
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

595
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.740
<v Speaker 3>this is Cain man.</v>

596
00:14:29.741 --> 00:14:31.480
<v Speaker 3>So I've heard a lot of the things that went on there.</v>

597
00:14:31.481 --> 00:14:33.640
<v Speaker 3>So I think they fight at sea level,</v>

598
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.911
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

599
00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:34.744
<v Speaker 3>we're going to see,</v>

600
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.640
<v Speaker 3>but to say that fight took years off Keynes life.</v>

601
00:14:36.641 --> 00:14:36.771
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

602
00:14:36.771 --> 00:14:37.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

603
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.321
<v Speaker 3>Not like the same way.</v>

604
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Junior dos Santos Kane did.</v>

605
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.073
<v Speaker 3>Do you think,</v>

606
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.110
<v Speaker 3>do you have any reservations about them fighting in Brazil?</v>

607
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.020
<v Speaker 3>If I'm Cain and I'm like,</v>

608
00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:49.450
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck the fuck's wrong with you?</v>

609
00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:51.440
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with you man?</v>

610
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm a champion.</v>

611
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.960
<v Speaker 3>How long are you?</v>

612
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.870
<v Speaker 3>Probably the wolves,</v>

613
00:14:53.871 --> 00:14:54.501
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>

614
00:14:54.501 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 3>can we some drug that's in this bitch?</v>

615
00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.320
<v Speaker 3>Fabrizio was the champ.</v>

616
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:58.430
<v Speaker 3>They'll still be drug testing.</v>

617
00:14:58.431 --> 00:14:59.930
<v Speaker 3>It'd be Brazilian drug testing.</v>

618
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.153
<v Speaker 3>They should be fine.</v>

619
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:01.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

620
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:01.941
<v Speaker 3>that'd be fine.</v>

621
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:02.870
<v Speaker 3>That works for everybody.</v>

622
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.310
<v Speaker 3>I think if he tore Belfort's doctors,</v>

623
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

624
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:06.980
<v Speaker 3>responsible for some,</v>

625
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.940
<v Speaker 3>some of that over there.</v>

626
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

627
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:08.900
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

628
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.733
<v Speaker 3>He knows what he's doing.</v>

629
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

630
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.460
<v Speaker 3>don't get me started.</v>

631
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.020
<v Speaker 3>I fought in Brazil's a,</v>

632
00:15:13.021 --> 00:15:13.790
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

633
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:14.623
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

634
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel good.</v>

635
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.320
<v Speaker 3>You have the truck exhaust pouring into my locker.</v>

636
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.430
<v Speaker 3>You'll be fine.</v>

637
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:20.263
<v Speaker 3>Swear to God.</v>

638
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:21.463
<v Speaker 3>Swear on my life.</v>

639
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.820
<v Speaker 3>My coach truck exhausted,</v>

640
00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:24.800
<v Speaker 3>pouring it back up.</v>

641
00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:29.720
<v Speaker 3>Trucks where I fought in the trucks were backed up and on and the exhaust coming</v>

642
00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:30.550
<v Speaker 3>in my locker room.</v>

643
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.430
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] we're all sleepy and my coach goes pro,</v>

644
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:34.700
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

645
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Wake the fuck up.</v>

646
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:35.751
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

647
00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

648
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:36.441
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

649
00:15:36.441 --> 00:15:37.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm there six hours early.</v>

650
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:37.880
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>

651
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.713
<v Speaker 3>He was wake up,</v>

652
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:39.650
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

653
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.450
<v Speaker 3>Everyone and everyone like down.</v>

654
00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:41.781
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

655
00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:44.180
<v Speaker 3>it's the truck fumes to get outta here.</v>

656
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.280
<v Speaker 3>So we had to go outside and warm up outside.</v>

657
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.590
<v Speaker 3>No true story.</v>

658
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.030
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

659
00:15:50.031 --> 00:15:51.590
<v Speaker 3>That's like getting drugs are weird,</v>

660
00:15:51.591 --> 00:15:52.330
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

661
00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:53.180
<v Speaker 3>You're in Brazil.</v>

662
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.750
<v Speaker 3>You think [inaudible] you're striking coach,</v>

663
00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.940
<v Speaker 3>you're sucking fumes from trucks.</v>

664
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.200
<v Speaker 3>Terrible idea.</v>

665
00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:04.040
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things that could've gone better and that situation,</v>

666
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.680
<v Speaker 3>but I find it weird how life works out though.</v>

667
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:08.240
<v Speaker 3>It all leads to this.</v>

668
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:08.841
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

669
00:16:08.841 --> 00:16:09.231
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

670
00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:09.711
<v Speaker 3>How weird,</v>

671
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:10.640
<v Speaker 3>how life works out.</v>

672
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

673
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:11.841
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

674
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:15.590
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't always like some people are defeated by setbacks and some people you</v>

675
00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:17.150
<v Speaker 3>set to to move forward.</v>

676
00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:18.770
<v Speaker 3>It's like we were talking about Ryan Bader,</v>

677
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.330
<v Speaker 3>he's a perfect example.</v>

678
00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:21.800
<v Speaker 3>I had a couple of years ago,</v>

679
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.540
<v Speaker 3>people were writing Ryan Bader off.</v>

680
00:16:23.541 --> 00:16:24.560
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that long ago.</v>

681
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.610
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

682
00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:27.560
<v Speaker 3>100% I agree.</v>

683
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:28.401
<v Speaker 3>Now looking at beats,</v>

684
00:16:28.401 --> 00:16:30.500
<v Speaker 3>Osp beats phase Xiao,</v>

685
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:31.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

686
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.680
<v Speaker 3>looks fucking fantastic against Phil Davis.</v>

687
00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.630
<v Speaker 3>Looks fantastic against Rashad.</v>

688
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:36.771
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

689
00:16:36.771 --> 00:16:37.271
<v Speaker 3>fuck that.</v>

690
00:16:37.271 --> 00:16:37.461
<v Speaker 3>I'd be,</v>

691
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:40.070
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't have this podcast and these live shows and shit right now,</v>

692
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.720
<v Speaker 3>I'd be in training camp getting ready for,</v>

693
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:46.310
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably some black beast on fucking fight pass black beast.</v>

694
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.271
<v Speaker 3>He called me on.</v>

695
00:16:47.271 --> 00:16:48.080
<v Speaker 3>That's why I said it.</v>

696
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.270
<v Speaker 3>I was hitting it.</v>

697
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:49.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

698
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:50.361
<v Speaker 3>Hey Bro,</v>

<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

700
00:16:50.691 --> 00:16:51.770
<v Speaker 3>Pick a guy can actually fight.</v>

701
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.470
<v Speaker 3>That'd be a fight that I would actually encourage you to probably take.</v>

702
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:54.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

703

705
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.600
<v Speaker 3>I grip this Jay Leno Denim shirt bright off right now and beat him up.</v>

706
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.580
<v Speaker 3>He's a tough guy though.</v>

707
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.630
<v Speaker 3>He's a tough guy.</v>

708
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.411
<v Speaker 3>He was very tough.</v>

709
00:17:06.411 --> 00:17:07.010
<v Speaker 3>He hits a friend,</v>

710
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.431
<v Speaker 3>the UFC,</v>

711
00:17:07.431 --> 00:17:08.270
<v Speaker 3>they're all tough.</v>

712
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.070
<v Speaker 3>Not as tough as be shop.</v>

713
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.150
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about,</v>

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:22.841
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

732
00:17:29.571 --> 00:17:29.930
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

733
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.430
<v Speaker 3>It depends on which Rothwell we get.</v>

734
00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:32.000
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

735
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.650
<v Speaker 3>Roth was confident as fuck.</v>

736
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.850
<v Speaker 3>And he's tough as fuck.</v>

737
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.860
<v Speaker 3>He hits hard.</v>

738
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:37.600
<v Speaker 3>You look at the,</v>

739
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:37.911
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

740
00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:39.020
<v Speaker 3>you know more than anybody,</v>

741
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:39.771
<v Speaker 3>but you look at that,</v>

742
00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:40.730
<v Speaker 3>Brendan verified,</v>

743
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.650
<v Speaker 3>he beat the shit out of Brendan Vera.</v>

744
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.251
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

747
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.910
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is is I brought he and then I come flying in.</v>

748
00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:52.320
<v Speaker 3>They click some of that left hook,</v>

749
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.363
<v Speaker 3>which is whatever.</v>

750
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.130
<v Speaker 3>This is how stupid I was back then when now for me,</v>

751
00:17:56.131 --> 00:17:56.821
<v Speaker 3>Ben Rothwell,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this is such an easy fight.</v>

766
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:11.540
<v Speaker 3>So did you under estimate him 100% I thought he's this big slow guy.</v>

767
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.530
<v Speaker 3>Just right before we go in the cage.</v>

00:18:29.911 --> 00:18:30.990

<v Speaker 3>I loved how he fought against Overeem dude.</v>

00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:41.580
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.410
<v Speaker 3>It's scary guy with experience like that.</v>

787
00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:44.244
<v Speaker 3>It's tough.</v>

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:45.751
<v Speaker 3>He's scary,</v>

00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:45.991
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 3>We'll see man suit like Steve.</v>

791
00:18:47.371 --> 00:18:48.510
<v Speaker 3>Steve Bay's a motherfucker,</v>

792
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.500
<v Speaker 3>he's just gotta be in incredible shape for Steve Bay cause steep pays so fit.</v>

793
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.910
<v Speaker 3>He's so fit.</v>

794
00:18:53.911 --> 00:18:54.571
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

795
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:58.050
<v Speaker 3>he gained a lot of confidence in the junior dos Santos fight when five hard</v>

796
00:18:58.051 --> 00:18:59.880
<v Speaker 3>rounds Dosantos in a war.</v>

797
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:01.410
<v Speaker 3>It was a really close war.</v>

798
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:04.380
<v Speaker 3>And then he goes from that to beat the shit out of Mark Hunt.</v>

799
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean steep pays on a roll right now.</v>

800
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:06.721
<v Speaker 3>This is the,</v>

801
00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:07.740
<v Speaker 3>this is the only,</v>

802
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:12.390
<v Speaker 3>I think x factor in this fight is Rothwell is so fucking tough.</v>

803
00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:15.390
<v Speaker 3>And Rothwell has knocked out power where Steve Bay really doesn't.</v>

804
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:15.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

805
00:19:15.871 --> 00:19:16.950
<v Speaker 3>Steve Bay is more of a,</v>

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.830

846
00:20:13.831 --> 00:20:14.370
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

847
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:15.960
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that's not the main event.</v>

848
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:17.610
<v Speaker 3>Who is it?</v>

849
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.790
<v Speaker 3>Duffy and Duffy employees are great,</v>

850
00:20:19.791 --> 00:20:22.110
<v Speaker 3>but it's a great fight off the east.</v>

851
00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.650
<v Speaker 3>Jo Duffy's a fucking Duffy's.</v>

852
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:25.260
<v Speaker 3>Boxing's ridiculous.</v>

853
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.470
<v Speaker 3>He's a very good Conor McGregor.</v>

854
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.050
<v Speaker 3>He's got good kicking too.</v>

855
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.140
<v Speaker 3>He's got a really good overall may game.</v>

856
00:20:34.141 --> 00:20:36.470
<v Speaker 3>He mixes things up monster to man.</v>

857
00:20:36.471 --> 00:20:37.710
<v Speaker 3>Especially at that weight class.</v>

858
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:40.643
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe it.</v>

861
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.220
<v Speaker 3>I just can't believe steep bay.</v>

862
00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.740
<v Speaker 3>Was he right nor two in the world.</v>

863
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.780
<v Speaker 3>He'll get a main event.</v>

864
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.130
<v Speaker 3>Is he number two now?</v>

865
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:47.651
<v Speaker 3>It's Keynes.</v>

866
00:20:47.651 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Gotta be</v>

867
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.813
<v Speaker 1>number one.</v>

868
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Junior dos Santos are steep.</v>

869
00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.270
<v Speaker 1>What junior's injured right now is he?</v>

870
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:53.441
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

871
00:20:53.441 --> 00:20:55.090
<v Speaker 1>he's fine now he's fighting over to him in December.</v>

872
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:55.481
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

873
00:20:55.481 --> 00:20:59.560
<v Speaker 1>But he was just coming off a surgery through any did Steve Bay.</v>

874
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.500
<v Speaker 1>But that steep ab mark with jds beat mark.</v>

875
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

876
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.020
<v Speaker 1>But junior beat steep in his last fight.</v>

877
00:21:05.021 --> 00:21:07.760
<v Speaker 1>I think he's gotta be number one out.</v>

878
00:21:07.761 --> 00:21:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Sub side cane.</v>

879
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.330
<v Speaker 1>I think Keynes got to be number one.</v>

880
00:21:10.331 --> 00:21:12.370
<v Speaker 1>And then juniors gotta be number two.</v>

881
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:12.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

882
00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.780
<v Speaker 1>it would make sense Steve Base three.</v>

883
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

884
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.060
<v Speaker 1>And then our last keys for round five.</v>

885
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.830
<v Speaker 1>There's some fucking weird weird shit with a rating one to,</v>

886
00:21:23.831 --> 00:21:25.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who the fuck does him.</v>

887
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Some of the ratings were real weird man.</v>

888
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes guys beat guys and they're below him.</v>

889
00:21:30.731 --> 00:21:31.331
<v Speaker 1>And the ratings,</v>

890
00:21:31.331 --> 00:21:31.781
<v Speaker 1>you're like wait,</v>

891
00:21:31.781 --> 00:21:32.830
<v Speaker 1>it's super weird.</v>

892
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how they work.</v>

893
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Who Decides?</v>

894
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:36.341
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

895
00:21:36.341 --> 00:21:37.810
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck the sides?</v>

896
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:38.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

897
00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Like your why a hall.</v>

898
00:21:39.851 --> 00:21:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Here's a perfect example.</v>

899
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Uriah Hall.</v>

900
00:21:42.371 --> 00:21:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Where's Musashi?</v>

901
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Above Uriah Hall.</v>

902
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Weill Hall just jumped,</v>

903
00:21:46.731 --> 00:21:47.531
<v Speaker 1>Spinning Back,</v>

904
00:21:47.531 --> 00:21:48.370
<v Speaker 1>kick gay garb.</v>

905
00:21:48.371 --> 00:21:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Musashi in the face,</v>

906
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.681
<v Speaker 1>flying.</v>

907
00:21:50.681 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Need him in the face and then beat him down for a Tko.</v>

908
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:58.980
<v Speaker 1>So you tell me how the fuck is Uriah Hall number 10 and Gay Garden was saucy is</v>

909
00:21:59.741 --> 00:22:02.860
<v Speaker 1>number eight with all due respect and gay guards a great fighter.</v>

910
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.840
<v Speaker 1>And people like he's a better fighter.</v>

911
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:05.411
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

912
00:22:05.411 --> 00:22:06.560
<v Speaker 1>he's not talk.</v>

913
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:07.691
<v Speaker 1>And he lost.</v>

914
00:22:07.691 --> 00:22:08.350
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

915
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Uriah Hall's the better fighter you might locate gay guard Musashi's background.</v>

916
00:22:12.311 --> 00:22:12.431
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

917
00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:12.851
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

918
00:22:12.851 --> 00:22:14.320
<v Speaker 1>you got to see gay Garmin saucy.</v>

919
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.720
<v Speaker 1>He beat jock array in Japan.</v>

920
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.140
<v Speaker 1>He beat Dan Henderson.</v>

921
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:20.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

922
00:22:20.741 --> 00:22:21.270
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

923
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean you look at his victories in the UFC and he'd go,</v>

924
00:22:24.041 --> 00:22:24.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

925
00:22:24.221 --> 00:22:25.690
<v Speaker 1>he's gotta be the guy,</v>

926
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.220
<v Speaker 1>but no fire.</v>

927
00:22:27.221 --> 00:22:29.170
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] hall fought him and beat him.</v>

928
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.101
<v Speaker 1>He should be above them.</v>

929
00:22:30.101 --> 00:22:30.641
<v Speaker 1>And the rankings,</v>

930
00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:31.620
<v Speaker 1>those rankings are crazy.</v>

931
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.700
<v Speaker 1>100% those are crazy rankings.</v>

932
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck do you have to do to move up in the rankings if you can't</v>

933
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.230
<v Speaker 1>jump spinning back,</v>

934
00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:40.900
<v Speaker 1>kick a guy in the face and then flying Nia guy in the face.</v>

935
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:41.590
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

936
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:42.670
<v Speaker 1>in the second round.</v>

937
00:22:42.671 --> 00:22:43.180
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

938
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:43.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

939
00:22:43.391 --> 00:22:44.290
<v Speaker 1>he lost the first round.</v>

940
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:45.550
<v Speaker 1>He got taken down and dominated.</v>

941
00:22:45.551 --> 00:22:49.270
<v Speaker 1>But so did Anderson Silva when Anderson Silva fought shale sun in the second</v>

942
00:22:49.271 --> 00:22:49.820
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

943
00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Well we got to still ranked shale son and above Anderson Silva after Annison</v>

944
00:22:53.381 --> 00:22:54.440
<v Speaker 1>kneed him in the body and,</v>

945
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:55.120
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

946
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:55.691
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

947
00:22:55.691 --> 00:22:56.740
<v Speaker 1>and stopped him in the,</v>

948
00:22:56.741 --> 00:22:57.580
<v Speaker 1>in the third fight.</v>

949
00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the second fight rather have a rhyme or reason to the banking</v>

950
00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:01.570
<v Speaker 1>madness.</v>

951
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Like remember when they were going to pay guys based off their rank and I was</v>

952
00:23:03.971 --> 00:23:04.804
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

953
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.680
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

954
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.000
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking insane.</v>

955
00:23:07.001 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Crazy cause that's up for debate.</v>

956
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

957
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:10.000
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

958
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.833
<v Speaker 1>who makes that?</v>

959
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:11.460
<v Speaker 1>I need to know.</v>

960
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a bunch of dude.</v>

961
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.380
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>

962
00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:17.500
<v Speaker 1>That that is one of the most big go back to where it was pleased.</v>

963
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Hey good.</v>

964
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:18.311
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

965
00:23:18.311 --> 00:23:19.900
<v Speaker 1>That ranking the lightweights.</v>

966
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:20.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

967
00:23:20.291 --> 00:23:24.310
<v Speaker 1>but that is one of the worst ranking system situations I've ever seen.</v>

968
00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.530
<v Speaker 1>When you win in a spectacular way,</v>

969
00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:30.640
<v Speaker 1>like Uriah Hall just did and you are not were awarded by moving up in the</v>

970
00:23:30.641 --> 00:23:31.474
<v Speaker 1>rankings.</v>

971
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:32.320
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

972
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.110
<v Speaker 1>that's the definition of insanity and it doesn't make any sense.</v>

973
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.330
<v Speaker 1>That's goofy as fuck man.</v>

974
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.720
<v Speaker 1>There's Jason Wellness getting a little Vaseline.</v>

975
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Let me see those light weight rankings.</v>

976
00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:42.941
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

977
00:23:42.941 --> 00:23:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Like how the fuck do you rank all those monsters?</v>

978
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 1>That okay.</v>

979
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

980
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:48.350
<v Speaker 1>who do we got here?</v>

981
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Pedis makes sense to Serone.</v>

982
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:51.283
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>

983
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.771
<v Speaker 1>Normal.</v>

984
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:51.891
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

985
00:23:51.891 --> 00:23:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Madoff three all make sense Eddie Alvarez for,</v>

986
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.120
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

987
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Alvarez only has one victory in the UFC though,</v>

988
00:23:58.131 --> 00:23:58.371
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

989
00:23:58.371 --> 00:23:58.851
<v Speaker 1>That's tough.</v>

990
00:23:58.851 --> 00:24:01.040
<v Speaker 1>So they're going based off his bride Melendez.</v>

991
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.270
<v Speaker 1>He'd beat Melendez.</v>

992
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Michael Johnson,</v>

993
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Michael Johnson's very high level right now he's looking real good.</v>

994
00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Michael Johnson just lose to somebody or yeah,</v>

995
00:24:10.921 --> 00:24:11.390
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

996
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.571
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

997
00:24:11.571 --> 00:24:12.260
<v Speaker 1>he lost.</v>

998
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.400
<v Speaker 1>But he actually beat him.</v>

999
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:17.300
<v Speaker 1>But he lost the control decision to homeboy from a black house.</v>

1000
00:24:17.301 --> 00:24:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Great striker.</v>

1001
00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:18.561
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1002
00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:19.394
<v Speaker 1>But Neal dairy,</v>

1003
00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.141
<v Speaker 1>dairy,</v>

1004
00:24:20.141 --> 00:24:20.550
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>

1005
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:21.890
<v Speaker 1>whereas in the ratings,</v>

1006
00:24:21.891 --> 00:24:23.870
<v Speaker 1>he's down at number 10 that's interesting.</v>

1007
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.940
<v Speaker 1>So Michael Johnson is all the way up at number five and he lost.</v>

1008
00:24:27.941 --> 00:24:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Have Been Neil diary you.</v>

1009

1010
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.793
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1015
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.350
<v Speaker 1>John's got a raw deal.</v>

1016
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:39.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1017
00:24:39.741 --> 00:24:41.120
<v Speaker 1>100% and I could drop.</v>

1018
00:24:41.121 --> 00:24:41.481
<v Speaker 1>Must Be.</v>

1019
00:24:41.481 --> 00:24:43.210
<v Speaker 1>And he wasn't at all the ratings.</v>

1020
00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:43.900
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a dairy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Miles.</v>

1027
00:24:49.491 --> 00:24:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Jury number nine.</v>

1028
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.351
<v Speaker 1>I thought miles,</v>

1029
00:24:51.351 --> 00:24:53.960
<v Speaker 1>jury and move to featherweight now isn't he?</v>

1030
00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Did he move to featherweight?</v>

1031
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Isn't he fighting someone in the featherweight division is the next one.</v>

1032
00:24:59.181 --> 00:25:00.014
<v Speaker 1>I thought so too.</v>

1033
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:01.263
<v Speaker 1>Hmm?</v>

1034
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever watched his ink master?</v>

1035
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:03.643
<v Speaker 1>This is a good show.</v>

1036
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I have watched.</v>

1037
00:25:04.761 --> 00:25:08.000
<v Speaker 1>It seems weird to have contests on Permacol a dig it man.</v>

1038
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Permanent artwork on someone's body.</v>

1039
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.093
<v Speaker 1>Navarro though.</v>

1040
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.081
<v Speaker 1>Fuck sakes,</v>

1041
00:25:12.081 --> 00:25:12.291
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

1042
00:25:12.291 --> 00:25:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Easy on the eye makeup.</v>

1043
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1044
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.270
<v Speaker 1>I like him.</v>

1045
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful Man.</v>

1046
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:15.703
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1047
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.191
<v Speaker 1>Don't you run?</v>

1048
00:25:16.191 --> 00:25:16.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan.</v>

1049
00:25:16.701 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 1>I heard he has a hockey with Carmen Electra.</v>

1050
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:19.363
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1051
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.800
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1052
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.570
<v Speaker 1>you got to chill out on my makeup,</v>

1053
00:25:21.571 --> 00:25:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

1054
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:23.780
<v Speaker 1>If I'm going to continue to watch the show.</v>

1055
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1056
00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:24.770
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

1057
00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Welter weight out mother fucker.</v>

1058
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.010
<v Speaker 1>Here's the dark horse in the lightweight division.</v>

1059
00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Now Thompson,</v>

1060
00:25:31.951 --> 00:25:33.440
<v Speaker 1>he motherfucking Ferguson.</v>

1061
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.150
<v Speaker 1>That's your dark horse right there,</v>

1062
00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Tony.</v>

1063
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.321
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1064
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:36.901
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1065
00:25:36.901 --> 00:25:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Tony Ferguson's the dark horse.</v>

1066
00:25:38.261 --> 00:25:38.601
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1067
00:25:38.601 --> 00:25:40.370
<v Speaker 1>he's the hardest hitter and the entire division.</v>

1068
00:25:40.371 --> 00:25:41.330
<v Speaker 1>He spooky too.</v>

1069
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:42.590
<v Speaker 1>There's something spooky about him.</v>

1070
00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.401
<v Speaker 1>He's so game.</v>

1071
00:25:43.401 --> 00:25:44.240
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

1072
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.770
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1073
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:46.000
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad motherfucker,</v>

1074
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:46.843
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1075
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:47.391
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

1076
00:25:47.391 --> 00:25:50.720
<v Speaker 1>How do you have Kelvin ranked 15 didn't he?</v>

1077
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Did Calvin when his last fight at one 85 and then they allowed them to fight at</v>

1078
00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:56.474
<v Speaker 1>one 70 again.</v>

1079
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:57.261
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>

1080
00:25:57.261 --> 00:25:57.471
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1081
00:25:57.471 --> 00:25:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Beat Nate.</v>

1082
00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:58.610
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1083
00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:59.480
<v Speaker 1>The shit out of Nate.</v>

1084
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.961
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1085
00:25:59.961 --> 00:26:00.794
<v Speaker 1>And they forced him out.</v>

1086
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1087
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.050
<v Speaker 1>That was the sad fight.</v>

1088
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.320
<v Speaker 1>I did not enjoy that fight.</v>

1089
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Fucking terrible.</v>

1090
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:05.600
<v Speaker 1>And Nate's still fighting.</v>

1091
00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1092
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.823
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

1093
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.791
<v Speaker 1>How about Hendrix?</v>

1094
00:26:07.791 --> 00:26:08.810
<v Speaker 1>How about your boy Hendrix?</v>

1095
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:10.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1096
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Are they gonna make him fight a middleweight now?</v>

1097
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.460
<v Speaker 1>He said he's not fighting middle age,</v>

1098
00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.540
<v Speaker 1>so he's going to go one more time.</v>

1099
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:15.200
<v Speaker 1>It went 70.</v>

1100
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1101
00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.133
<v Speaker 1>how's he going to do that?</v>

1102
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.300
<v Speaker 1>That would cause Dana White's it.</v>

1103
00:26:17.301 --> 00:26:18.250
<v Speaker 1>I consider him a minute wait,</v>

1104
00:26:18.251 --> 00:26:19.130
<v Speaker 1>and I miss wait,</v>

1105
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.540
<v Speaker 1>fucked everybody up.</v>

1106
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:21.231
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up.</v>

1107
00:26:21.231 --> 00:26:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Tyrone's would tell a guy what weight to fight it.</v>

1108
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Especially your Johny Hendricks.</v>

1109
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Well you can if you won't give them a fight at one 70 because you got to such a</v>

1110
00:26:29.751 --> 00:26:30.950
<v Speaker 1>talent rich division.</v>

1111
00:26:30.951 --> 00:26:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean look at what you got down there at welterweight.</v>

1112
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:33.883
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

1113
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:35.420
<v Speaker 1>You got Rory Macdonald,</v>

1114
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Tyron Woodley,</v>

1115
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.850
<v Speaker 1>you got Hendrix,</v>

1116
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:38.953
<v Speaker 1>then you go those guys,</v>

1117
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.360
<v Speaker 1>guest stars and hacks.</v>

1118
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:45.750
<v Speaker 1>But people don't pay to see Hendrix like they pay to see like a George Saint</v>

1119
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Pierre or like a,</v>

1120
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.670
<v Speaker 1>they paid to see,</v>

1121
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1122
00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:52.770
<v Speaker 1>like some of the bigger stars in the UFC because a lot of people thought that</v>

1123
00:26:52.771 --> 00:26:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Hendrix,</v>

1124
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.020
<v Speaker 1>like in some of his victories,</v>

1125
00:26:55.021 --> 00:26:56.460
<v Speaker 1>like the Matte Brown fight,</v>

1126
00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:58.440
<v Speaker 1>they thought that it wasn't that exciting.</v>

1127
00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:58.891
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

1128
00:26:58.891 --> 00:26:59.140
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1129
00:26:59.140 --> 00:26:59.911
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>

1130
00:26:59.911 --> 00:27:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll pay to see that guy any day of the week,</v>

1131
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:02.910
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's fighting smart.</v>

1132
00:27:02.911 --> 00:27:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1133
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I liked that he uses his wrestling bro.</v>

1134
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Besides Robbie Lawler,</v>

1135
00:27:06.421 --> 00:27:08.100
<v Speaker 1>who's the most sane guy in the division?</v>

1136
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Comments.</v>

1137
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Pretty God damn exciting.</v>

1138
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:11.070
<v Speaker 1>But he's been gone for a while,</v>

1139
00:27:11.071 --> 00:27:11.821
<v Speaker 1>but he's excited.</v>

1140
00:27:11.821 --> 00:27:12.270
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

1141
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:14.880
<v Speaker 1>But he just knocked out Taco Alvarez with nasty elbow.</v>

1142
00:27:14.881 --> 00:27:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Matt Brown is about as exciting as a fucking human being can get.</v>

1143
00:27:17.931 --> 00:27:18.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying exciting.</v>

1144
00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:20.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying to a bigger named Johnny Hendricks Bolt Near.</v>

1145
00:27:20.941 --> 00:27:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are bigger than Hendricks conduct.</v>

1146
00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:22.981
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>

1147
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:24.060
<v Speaker 1>but he's been gone for awhile.</v>

1148
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Interests tend to cause a big name,</v>

1149
00:27:25.621 --> 00:27:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

1150
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.270
<v Speaker 1>He's a big name,</v>

1151
00:27:27.271 --> 00:27:31.110
<v Speaker 1>but I don't necessarily know how that translates to pay per view buys,</v>

1152
00:27:31.111 --> 00:27:32.990
<v Speaker 1>which at the end of the day is all they care.</v>

1153
00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Huge fat.</v>

1154
00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying a guy like Johnny Hendricks at what is the a two time champion?</v>

1155
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:37.170
<v Speaker 1>You can't say,</v>

1156
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:37.291
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1157
00:27:37.291 --> 00:27:38.700
<v Speaker 1>you got to set it when 85 if he's like,</v>

1158
00:27:38.701 --> 00:27:38.861
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1159
00:27:38.861 --> 00:27:39.001
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1160
00:27:39.001 --> 00:27:40.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm making it what you do.</v>

1161
00:27:40.231 --> 00:27:43.620
<v Speaker 1>If he doesn't make the weight more than once and he's already missed the weight</v>

1162
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:44.454
<v Speaker 1>twice,</v>

1163
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.301
<v Speaker 1>he's missed.</v>

1164
00:27:45.301 --> 00:27:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Wait twice and barely made it for one of the Lawler.</v>

1165
00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.290
<v Speaker 1>He came in way over.</v>

1166
00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Wait for this to like 26 pounds when I heard him.</v>

1167
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1168
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1169
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.850
<v Speaker 1>he was heavy as fuck.</v>

1170
00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:54.511
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

1171
00:27:54.511 --> 00:27:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Joe Schilling is about to fucking throw down.</v>

1172
00:27:56.801 --> 00:27:57.634
<v Speaker 1>Let's do this.</v>

1173
00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.513

1176
00:28:02.221 --> 00:28:03.330
<v Speaker 1>big fight and hit the guy.</v>

1177
00:28:03.331 --> 00:28:03.850
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting.</v>

1178
00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Chasing wellness is a fucking beast.</v>

1179
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Wellness's nasty.</v>

1180
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.001
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

1181
00:28:09.001 --> 00:28:09.781
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>

1182
00:28:09.781 --> 00:28:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Striker man.</v>

1183
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Your boy Schilling flex and them.</v>

1184
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not mad at it either.</v>

1185
00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:14.271
<v Speaker 1>The body,</v>

1186
00:28:14.271 --> 00:28:15.700
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty yoked audit up.</v>

1187
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:18.960
<v Speaker 1>This is a good one.</v>

1188
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a good matchup.</v>

1189
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Stylist at 24 24 and nasty dude.</v>

1190
00:28:24.151 --> 00:28:25.920
<v Speaker 1>He's real good man.</v>

1191
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1192
00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:26.631
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1193
00:28:26.631 --> 00:28:28.140
<v Speaker 1>that welterweight division is tough.</v>

1194
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1195
00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.490
<v Speaker 1>it's tough.</v>

1196
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:32.690
<v Speaker 1>How's Hendricks do at one 85 how's he match up with 85 minutes for?</v>

1197
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.073
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>

1198
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.920
<v Speaker 1>How's he meant?</v>

1199
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1200
00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:36.420
<v Speaker 1>You gotta go to the champ.</v>

1201
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:37.560
<v Speaker 1>You go to the top of the,</v>

1202
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.060
<v Speaker 1>scroll down to middle eight for me.</v>

1203
00:28:39.061 --> 00:28:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

1204
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:40.620
<v Speaker 1>When whenever you do that,</v>

1205
00:28:40.621 --> 00:28:41.580
<v Speaker 1>you go to the top of the heap.</v>

1206
00:28:41.581 --> 00:28:42.870
<v Speaker 1>How does he match up with the champ?</v>

1207
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:43.733
<v Speaker 1>Bad idea.</v>

1208
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:45.091
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>

1209
00:28:45.091 --> 00:28:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I like a good,</v>

1210
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I liked them.</v>

1211
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:46.861
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>

1212
00:28:46.861 --> 00:28:47.820
<v Speaker 1>How does he match up with Luke?</v>

1213
00:28:47.821 --> 00:28:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Rockhold not so good.</v>

1214
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.420
<v Speaker 1>How's the matchup with joc right and not so good.</v>

1215
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.870
<v Speaker 1>How's he matchup with Yoel Romero not so like disagree.</v>

1216
00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Yoel Romero.</v>

1217
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.160
<v Speaker 1>I think he'd beat too.</v>

1218
00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll remember like,</v>

1219
00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.620
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

1220
00:28:58.621 --> 00:28:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Are you crazy?</v>

1221
00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.310
<v Speaker 1>That one hurts my feeling.</v>

1222
00:29:02.311 --> 00:29:02.971
<v Speaker 1>Are you serious?</v>

1223
00:29:02.971 --> 00:29:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Yoel Romero was a monster.</v>

1224
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.080
<v Speaker 1>UFC champ.</v>

1225
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1226
00:29:07.231 --> 00:29:07.671
<v Speaker 1>he's big.</v>

1227
00:29:07.671 --> 00:29:09.860
<v Speaker 1>You see what he did to Leo Machida in his last fight?</v>

1228
00:29:09.861 --> 00:29:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Did he did fuck my boy monster.</v>

1229
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.713
<v Speaker 1>He's a monster.</v>

1230
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:14.820
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>

1231
00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:15.321
<v Speaker 1>He is,</v>

1232
00:29:15.321 --> 00:29:18.660
<v Speaker 1>but at one 70 Johnny Hendricks is five eight he's small.</v>

1233
00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.330
<v Speaker 1>He's five.</v>

1234
00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Eight.</v>

1235
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:20.430
<v Speaker 1>He small.</v>

1236
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1237
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I stand next to him in the octagon and I have shoes on,</v>

1238
00:29:23.641 --> 00:29:24.474
<v Speaker 1>I'm taller than him.</v>

1239
00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.410
<v Speaker 1>If I'm taller than you,</v>

1240
00:29:25.411 --> 00:29:26.640
<v Speaker 1>you can't fight Yoel Romero.</v>

1241
00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.500
<v Speaker 1>That's just how the rules are.</v>

1242
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:30.600
<v Speaker 1>You and Callan and this height thing.</v>

1243
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.781
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1244
00:29:30.781 --> 00:29:30.931
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1245
00:29:30.931 --> 00:29:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure DC short.</v>

1246
00:29:32.461 --> 00:29:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying tiny fucking kicked up,</v>

1247
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.420
<v Speaker 1>but DC's big in a different way.</v>

1248
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Hendrick's is that big.</v>

1249
00:29:38.281 --> 00:29:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I think Hendrick's just carries too much body fat.</v>

1250
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.870
<v Speaker 1>I think Hendricks at one 70 cause 100% be the champ again.</v>

1251
00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:45.580
<v Speaker 1>100% a hundred percent for sure.</v>

1252
00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Figure it out.</v>

1253
00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Hendrix,</v>

1254
00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:47.980
<v Speaker 1>when he's on,</v>

1255
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean you got to look at his knockouts of Martin Kampmann and John Fitch.</v>

1256
00:29:51.011 --> 00:29:52.720
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking monster when he's on,</v>

1257
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean you always have to look at a guy though based on his last fight.</v>

1258
00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the unfortunate thing about fighting.</v>

1259
00:29:58.121 --> 00:29:59.950
<v Speaker 1>They always say you're only as good as your last fight.</v>

1260
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.510
<v Speaker 1>While his last fight,</v>

1261
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:03.490
<v Speaker 1>I thought he fought pretty fucking good,</v>

1262
00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:07.330
<v Speaker 1>but then his fight that was supposed to be his last fight.</v>

1263
00:30:07.331 --> 00:30:08.170
<v Speaker 1>He didn't make the weight.</v>

1264
00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:09.790
<v Speaker 1>That's where the controversy lies.</v>

1265
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:13.420
<v Speaker 1>The controversy lies is lack of discipline and coming into training camp have a</v>

1266
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:14.950
<v Speaker 1>heavy more than once.</v>

1267
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean not learning his lesson when he came in super fit for the map.</v>

1268
00:30:18.361 --> 00:30:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Brown fight look great.</v>

1269
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:19.951
<v Speaker 1>Sid,</v>

1270
00:30:19.951 --> 00:30:21.360
<v Speaker 1>he got ahold of his meal prep.</v>

1271
00:30:21.361 --> 00:30:23.260
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to argue this fight.</v>

1272
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:27.820
<v Speaker 1>He came into camp 10 pounds heavier than his last camp according to adult shake.</v>

1273
00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.620
<v Speaker 1>10 pounds is a lot man.</v>

1274
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:29.801
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1275
00:30:29.801 --> 00:30:31.240
<v Speaker 1>he didn't work with Delta for this gap though,</v>

1276
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.550
<v Speaker 1>but dolce knows what he came in at.</v>

1277
00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Doody came in at this camp versus what he came in at the last camp.</v>

1278
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows it.</v>

1279
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've all admitted it.</v>

1280
00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:41.170
<v Speaker 1>He admitted it when he talks about when he's,</v>

1281
00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.220
<v Speaker 1>it was camp went wrong,</v>

1282
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:45.140
<v Speaker 1>he talked about it and then you got to get a kidney stone.</v>

1283
00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Can't do it at this level.</v>

1284
00:30:48.251 --> 00:30:50.860
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck we do and might have an eating disorder.</v>

1285
00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:51.251
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1286
00:30:51.251 --> 00:30:53.260
<v Speaker 1>we were talking earlier about being addicted to shit.</v>

1287
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.730
<v Speaker 1>He might be addicted to eating and it might,</v>

1288
00:30:55.731 --> 00:30:57.460
<v Speaker 1>it might be addicted to eating and then if he is,</v>

1289
00:30:57.461 --> 00:30:58.011
<v Speaker 1>I am Paul.</v>

1290
00:30:58.011 --> 00:30:58.841
<v Speaker 1>His discipline,</v>

1291
00:30:58.841 --> 00:31:00.760
<v Speaker 1>the discipline of being a fighter,</v>

1292
00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:01.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1293
00:31:01.061 --> 00:31:03.280
<v Speaker 1>it might be so overwhelming that when he's not doing it,</v>

1294
00:31:03.281 --> 00:31:05.290
<v Speaker 1>he just a gorgeous the fuck up dude.</v>

1295
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:07.140
<v Speaker 1>He'll get to his level that have discipline.</v>

1296
00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:08.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going on.</v>

1297
00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Their discipline and addiction sometimes our next door neighbor's got that</v>

1298
00:31:11.891 --> 00:31:12.701
<v Speaker 1>middle weight division.</v>

1299
00:31:12.701 --> 00:31:13.534
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

1306
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yes.</v>

1307

<v Speaker 1>Oh always.</v>

1309
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.040
<v Speaker 1>No way around it.</v>

1310
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:28.023
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1311
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:29.710
<v Speaker 1>That's just part of the worst.</v>

1312
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.880
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the sport.</v>

1313
00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine my family watch me fight.</v>

1314

<v Speaker 1>Kickboxing is his shit.</v>

1325
00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.260
<v Speaker 1>His defense is tighter at kickboxing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just this movements and nasty as fuck.</v>

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Still alive affliction said God dammit.</v>

1360
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Rybak the one guy died and they got rid of Tom Atencio so who the fuck is</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1364
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.050
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting bro.</v>

1365
00:32:54.051 --> 00:32:58.850
<v Speaker 1>I used to rock those affliction shirts with like fucking both silver and angel</v>

1366
00:32:58.851 --> 00:33:03.851
<v Speaker 1>wings and it said like fade or on the back while I was friends with Atencio and</v>

1367
00:33:03.951 --> 00:33:05.660
<v Speaker 1>I liked what he did for fighters.</v>

1368
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:08.930
<v Speaker 1>He sponsored a lot of fighters and I uh,</v>

1369
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I supported them because of that.</v>

1370
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't need the affliction of money they were giving me.</v>

1371
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:14.690
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that much,</v>

1372
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.130
<v Speaker 1>it was just a little bit,</v>

1373
00:33:16.131 --> 00:33:20.600
<v Speaker 1>but in my mind I thought it was a good idea to support a company that was given</v>

1374
00:33:20.601 --> 00:33:21.500
<v Speaker 1>fighters a lot of money.</v>

1375
00:33:21.501 --> 00:33:25.460
<v Speaker 1>They were sponsoring a lot of fighters and they put together that affliction MMA</v>

1376
00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:27.410
<v Speaker 1>card and gave people a shitload of money.</v>

1377
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:27.801
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

1378
00:33:27.801 --> 00:33:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Joe Schilling looks good.</v>

1379
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.860
<v Speaker 1>They fucked up on that card though.</v>

1380
00:33:30.861 --> 00:33:33.860
<v Speaker 1>They put all their money on that one card and it was so dope.</v>

1381
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:35.810
<v Speaker 1>The card was stacked.</v>

1382
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:36.891
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

1383
00:33:36.891 --> 00:33:37.311

00:33:40.191 --> 00:33:40.970
<v Speaker 1>moving light.</v>

1387
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:44.540
<v Speaker 1>His foot works ridiculous and is looks real frustrated.</v>

1388
00:33:44.541 --> 00:33:46.220
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of like paralyzed a man.</v>

1389
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.720
<v Speaker 1>He's combinations.</v>

1390
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.520
<v Speaker 1>He might just be weathering the storm.</v>

1391
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.150
<v Speaker 1>He might be or it might be getting his ass.</v>

1392
00:33:53.151 --> 00:33:54.940
<v Speaker 1>He this five rounds so they go five rounds.</v>

1393
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:55.783
<v Speaker 1>Just going to title.</v>

1394
00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question because it's the main event.</v>

1395
00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Damn Joe shelling with the movement.</v>

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.451
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

1408
00:34:25.451 --> 00:34:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Throwing up front kicks.</v>

1409
00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.880
<v Speaker 1>He though when you're a tall fighter like that does front kicks to the body are</v>

1410
00:34:30.881 --> 00:34:31.720
<v Speaker 1>really nice.</v>

1411
00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1412
00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.280
<v Speaker 1>He's been a nice option.</v>

1413
00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Tough to counter that man.</v>

1414
00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Good defense here by shilling to,</v>

1415
00:34:36.071 --> 00:34:38.770
<v Speaker 1>he's is a different animal when he's kickbox he's confident.</v>

1416
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:39.820
<v Speaker 1>He's confident.</v>

1417
00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:44.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a sport is defense is way better with those big gloves is like super used</v>

1418
00:34:44.111 --> 00:34:44.240
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1419
00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.560
<v Speaker 1>It can also sound risk more.</v>

1420
00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1421
00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:48.730
<v Speaker 1>And he's not worried about being taken down so he could do his shit.</v>

1422
00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.730
<v Speaker 1>We'll have to talk them into fighting only kickboxing.</v>

1423
00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:52.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1424
00:34:52.991 --> 00:34:53.950
<v Speaker 1>give me an hour with them.</v>

1425
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:56.563
<v Speaker 1>Look at this man.</v>

1426
00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:57.311
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

1427
00:34:57.311 --> 00:34:58.031
<v Speaker 1>he's looking good.</v>

1428
00:34:58.031 --> 00:34:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Boom Bang Bang.</v>

1429
00:34:59.501 --> 00:35:01.020
<v Speaker 1>One to definitely I like,</v>

1430
00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:05.140
<v Speaker 1>I like how he's throwing the straight right and then a hard jab behind it too.</v>

1431
00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:06.910
<v Speaker 1>You know like after that right hand.</v>

1432
00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of MMA fighters especially,</v>

1433
00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:12.520
<v Speaker 1>they'll pull back and then look for either another right hand or whatever.</v>

1434
00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.650
<v Speaker 1>He stepping in hard with that jam.</v>

1435
00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:15.821
<v Speaker 1>Tell you what,</v>

1436
00:35:15.821 --> 00:35:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that Magnus Urena and up here he full.</v>

1437
00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.473
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1438
00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't think this sport,</v>

1439
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the sport gets the attention that it deserves.</v>

1440
00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:25.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1441
00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.710
<v Speaker 1>as excited as you and I were for this fight and this card like to me this is</v>

1442
00:35:29.711 --> 00:35:32.410
<v Speaker 1>like an opportunity to watch high level fighting.</v>

1443
00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Like whether or not it's MMA or it kicked off.</v>

1444
00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.153
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

1445
00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:39.120
<v Speaker 1>like I think the ultimate sport is MMA.</v>

1446
00:35:39.121 --> 00:35:40.650
<v Speaker 1>It always will be the ultimate sport.</v>

1447
00:35:40.651 --> 00:35:44.040
<v Speaker 1>But when I want to watch the best expression of striking technique,</v>

1448
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:48.330
<v Speaker 1>there's certain shit that you only see when you watch my tie or you only see</v>

1449
00:35:48.331 --> 00:35:50.400
<v Speaker 1>when you watch kickboxing and this is it right here.</v>

1450
00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Like these kind of Duke it out battles.</v>

1451
00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.120
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

1452
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:54.901
<v Speaker 1>I don't get like,</v>

1453
00:35:54.901 --> 00:35:58.020

00:39:20.301 --> 00:39:23.550
<v Speaker 1>That's better than knockdowns bigger because showing was it?</v>

1599
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1600
00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:24.993
<v Speaker 1>That's bigger.</v>

1601
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:27.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1602
00:39:27.581 --> 00:39:28.361
<v Speaker 1>He was wobbled too.</v>

1603
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:33.361
<v Speaker 1>That was a real knockdown dude that's an even round knew cause he knocked him</v>

1604
00:39:33.491 --> 00:39:33.730
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1605
00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Shilling got fucked up.</v>

1606
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.850
<v Speaker 1>He got tagged for sure.</v>

1607
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.960
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

1608
00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:42.760
<v Speaker 1>he used good defense and clinched up knockdowns and kickboxing or big dude,</v>

1609
00:39:42.761 --> 00:39:44.200
<v Speaker 1>just like knock downs in boxing.</v>

1610
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:47.410
<v Speaker 1>They were like a takedown MMA fight where you get rocked.</v>

1611
00:39:47.411 --> 00:39:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Like if a guy gets dropped in an MMA fight and another guy lands fights like</v>

1612
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.153
<v Speaker 1>punches like that,</v>

1613
00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.810
<v Speaker 1>that's a hard fight to score.</v>

1614
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a nine nine round.</v>

1615
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1616
00:39:56.290 --> 00:40:00.220
<v Speaker 1>I could be nine nine but the knocked down his big dude cause I wouldn't give</v>

<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1744
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:12.463
<v Speaker 1>It's the Internet.</v>

1745
00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Tony.</v>

1752
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.761
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1753
00:43:22.761 --> 00:43:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Kenny Florian was in Japan and rolled with a oak.</v>

1754
00:43:25.231 --> 00:43:25.491
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1755
00:43:25.491 --> 00:43:26.241
<v Speaker 1>who are you fighting next?</v>

1756
00:43:26.241 --> 00:43:26.690
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1757
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:27.523
<v Speaker 1>Suck Rama.</v>

1758
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.823
<v Speaker 1>Kenny's like what?</v>

1759
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:30.861
<v Speaker 1>It's a bummer.</v>

1760
00:43:30.861 --> 00:43:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1761
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:31.873
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1762
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:35.090
<v Speaker 1>here's a problem and he'll can Aoki can strike,</v>

1763
00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:35.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1764
00:43:35.811 --> 00:43:36.021

00:43:38.221 --> 00:43:39.020
<v Speaker 1>he's not that bad.</v>

1769
00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.270
<v Speaker 1>I think Sakharova has so many miles on them.</v>

1770
00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:41.721
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

1771
00:43:41.721 --> 00:43:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Aoki striking compared to soccer.</v>

1772
00:43:43.361 --> 00:43:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I right now he's fucking Joe.</v>

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.790
<v Speaker 1>He's taken so many fucking beatings.</v>

1777
00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Moore's 10 braces.</v>

1778
00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1779
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Think if Aoki gets hold of one of those old as ankles to rip it off,</v>

1780
00:43:56.181 --> 00:43:57.170
<v Speaker 1>like tales from the crypt.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think grappling wise,</v>

1783
00:43:59.601 --> 00:44:00.980
<v Speaker 1>he's still very competent.</v>

1790
00:44:06.231 --> 00:44:08.590
<v Speaker 1>he was able to go to a draw with Henzel.</v>

1791
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:09.051
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1792
00:44:09.051 --> 00:44:12.620

1793
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:13.910

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.030
<v Speaker 1>As much smaller too.</v>

1799
00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:21.020
<v Speaker 1>He was fought at lightweight where a Sakharova fuck Conan his first UFC fight.</v>

1800
00:44:21.021 --> 00:44:21.320
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:25.161
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1804
00:44:25.161 --> 00:44:25.730
<v Speaker 1>that fight,</v>

1805
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:26.121
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1806
00:44:26.121 --> 00:44:27.860
<v Speaker 1>the Vandelay knock outs were horrible,</v>

1807
00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:29.143
<v Speaker 1>horrific.</v>

1808
00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:33.390
<v Speaker 1>And then the knockout that might've been even worse as the Melvin Manhoef one.</v>

1809
00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:34.283
<v Speaker 1>Oof.</v>

1812
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:38.690
<v Speaker 1>an interesting fight.</v>

1813
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Shilling knocked him down the left hand too.</v>

1814
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:44.090
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting thing about Schilling is I think it was a straight left.</v>

1815
00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1816
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Schilling fights pretty good off both sides.</v>

1817
00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:48.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1818
00:44:48.261 --> 00:44:49.660
<v Speaker 1>He's a freak striking lifespan.</v>

1819
00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Good fight man.</v>

1823
00:44:53.541 --> 00:44:55.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm super happy for Joe.</v>
